<HEADLINE> Elian, father to meet in Washington  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives will bring
the 6-year-old boy to Washington on Wednesday for a meeting with
his father, a Cuban exile group said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate confirmation from either the Justice
Department or from the father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who is staying
at a Cuban diplomat's home outside Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Mas Santos, chairman of the Cuban American National
Foundation, told reporters Tuesday night that Elian's great-uncle
Lazaro Gonzalez would bring the boy to Washington for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Mas said the meeting would be closed to all non-family members
except Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder and Sen. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J. He said the meeting would occur at noon EDT at a
place yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
   ''After four and a half months, the private meeting that this
family has so yearned for with Juan Miguel Gonzalez tomorrow will
be a reality,'' Mas said. He said the family and the Justice
Department had both agreed to the details.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be at a neutral site, and there's basically
going to be a resolution of the situation,'' Jose Cardenas,
Washington director the Cuban exile group, told The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was announced at a Capitol Hill news conference.
Torricelli did not attend the news conference, but his spokesman,
Richard McGrath, confirmed that the senator was involved in the
negotiations to bring the boy to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''Senator Torricelli, Eric Holder and Greg Craig (the father's
attorney) worked out the arrangments,'' according to a source close
to the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath said Torricelli has been actively engaged in the issue,
but wouldn't confirm that a meeting had been arranged for
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The senator has been working for a period of time to keep
discussions going between the family and the Justice Department,''
McGrath said.
</P>
<P>
   The government had planned to send the Miami relatives a letter
outlining how and when they are to hand him over, but last Tuesday
a Justice Department official said the letter would not be sent.
The official also said it was unlikely that Reno would travel to
Miami on Wednesday, as was earlier thought.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, the Miami relatives asked to talk to the
father, but said they would only do so in Florida and added that
they would not relinquish the boy at such a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's possible return to her hometown -- where Cuban protesters
have displayed signs depicting her with horns and blaming her for
the Waco confrontation -- would come at a crucial time in the Elian
case.
</P>
<P>
   His Miami relatives have resisted her goal of reuniting the
6-year-old boy with his father this week, balking at handover plans
and continuing to press their court appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Arrangements were for the custody transfer were still being
worked out, said the official, who added that any meetings
involving Reno wouldn't alter the timetable being worked out for
Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
   Miami Mayor Joe Carollo, who discussed the situation with the
attorney general in Washington on Tuesday, said Reno was ''very
willing to meet Lazaro and any member of the Gonzalez family and
wants to meet with community leaders in Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials had said they would send the Miami relatives a
letter Tuesday with instructions for the custody transfer.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether the great-uncle would follow the
instructions, family spokesman Armando Gutierrez responded, ''All I
can tell you is that Lazaro will not break the law.''
</P>
<P>
   At Lazaro Gonzalez's house in Little Havana, where Elian has
been staying since he was rescued at sea while clinging to an inner
tube on Thanksgiving, five of his Miami schoolmates and his
principal stopped by to bring him a big card that read, ''Elian we
miss you.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been kept out of school recently because relatives
said they feared he would be taken away. The boy smiled and waved
goodbye to his classmates, then did a pull-up on the fence in front
the house and monkeyed around for TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   When the Miami relatives offered to meet with Elian's father,
they said they would bring the boy along if they were assured Elian
would not be taken during the reunion. The father is staying with a
Cuban diplomat in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ''Such meetings are essential and long overdue,'' Lazaro wrote
in a letter to a government-appointed psychiatrist. ''While we
cannot guarantee the ultimate outcome of discussions among the
family members, they might well help matters a great deal and could
not possibly make things any worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, a representative of the National
Council of Churches who met with the father Tuesday, said Juan
Miguel Gonzalez told her he would go to Florida if necessary to
reclaim his son.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'll do whatever he has to do short of meeting with
relatives,'' she said. ''He does not wish to meet with the
relatives until he has Elian in his arms.''
</P>
<P>
   The father's attorney, Gregory Craig, talked for nearly two
hours with Reno and other top officials and refused to comment
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the House Republican leadership and two
Cuban-American members of Miami's congressional delegation invited
Gonzalez, his wife and their infant son to a private meeting
Wednesday in the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want you to have the freedom to express your true feelings
during your visit without coercion and without intimidation,'' the
six lawmakers wrote. ''We want to be sure that you are aware of all
the options available to you as you make your decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives, pursuing another legal front, filed a brief
in Family Court on Tuesday, asking for a full hearing to bar
Elian's return to Cuba until his father's fitness is considered.
</P>
<P>
   The brief said Juan Miguel Gonzalez ''has engaged in abusive
conduct'' -- allegations the attorneys said the federal courts never
considered. It also said Elian would be subject to ''imminent
indoctrination'' in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The father's attorneys have characterized abuse allegations as
desperate tactics. The U.S. government asked the court to dismiss
the request, saying a state judge cannot overrule federal
immigration law.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, an overflow crowd of about 2,000 gathered at The
Shrine of Our Lady of Charity on the edge of Biscayne Bay to sing
and pray for Elian's mother and the 10 other Cubans who died when
their boat sank in the Florida Straits. Each victim's name was
read.

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak drew the Clinton
administration's endorsement today for his decision to pull Israeli troops out
of southern Lebanon. At the same time, he was prodded to move faster with the
Palestinians toward a West Bank withdrawal. ''We will do what we can to help,''
President Clinton said as he met at the White House with the Israeli leader. At
the 3{-hour mark, the two leaders gave no sign of ending their discussion.

Ugandan Police Seek Cult Leaders
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- Police on Tuesday put up rewards of about $1,300 for
information leading to the arrest of any of six cult leaders whose followers
were killed across southwest Uganda. Police have been searching for the leaders
since a fire in a cult chapel in the village of Kanungu on March 17 killed 530
people. Following the fire, authorities unearthed a series of mass graves in
nearby villages, turning up 394 more corpses. Many of those victims had been
strangled or stabbed. It remains unclear how many of the six are alive.
Unconfirmed reports say the group's two main leaders, Credonia Mwerinde and
Joseph Kibwetere, fled Kanungu just before the fire.

Russia May Ratify Start II Treaty
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian lawmakers agreed Tuesday to debate the long-delayed
START II arms treaty this week, following a ratification push from President
Vladimir Putin who is aiming for a landmark foreign policy move just weeks after
being elected. Lawmakers across the political spectrum predicted swift
ratification of the treaty that would halve the U.S. and Russian nuclear
arsenals to 3,000-3,500 warheads each. The debate is set for Friday. The treaty
was ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1996, but was repeatedly blocked by
Communists and hard-liners who dominated the State Duma, parliament's lower
house. The Communists lost their dominance in last December's elections.

Bush Unveils $42B Plan for Poor
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Continuing his outreach to independent and moderate
Democratic voters, Republican George W. Bush on Tuesday rolled out a five-year,
$42 billion plan to help the working poor move up into the middle class. The
biggest share of money, $35 billion, would be used for tax credits to help
people who don't get health insurance from their employers but earn too much to
qualify for government programs like Medicaid. They could use the credits to
gain access to basic private health care plans. An additional $5 billion would
be used to provide health care through medical savings accounts.

New High-Tech Visa Bill Introduced
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of the House immigration subcommittee on
Tuesday introduced legislation that would allow an unlimited number of visas
over the next three years for foreigners with prized high-tech skills. The
measure offered by Rep. Lamar Smith is far broader than a version he offered
just weeks ago that would have provided a one-time increase of 45,000 visas in
the program. The Texas Republican said his plan would address the booming
high-tech industry's plaint of persistent labor shortages. At a news conference,
Smith said he expanded his bill after learning that this year's demand for visas
outpaced last year's request by 50,000.

Tape Shows Knight Grabbing Player
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A videotape aired Tuesday night shows Indiana basketball
coach Bob Knight grabbing a player by the neck during a practice and pushing him
backwards. Two university trustees are investigating the outspoken and
controversial coach following recent reports from two former players that he
physically abused team members. Last month, CNN/Sports Illustrated reported
former player Neil Reed's allegation that Knight choked him during a 1997
practice. The videotape obtained by CNN/SI shows Knight grabbing a player by the
neck, pushing him backward. The player's head appeared to snap backward.

<HEADLINE> County leaders travel to Washington, D.C. to express concerns overland claims  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Sharing a concern over Indian land claims,
a delegation of officials from several upstate New York counties
planned to travel to Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ''The goal is to apprise our federal representatives of the
situation we're in ... We really think it's wrong that the federal
government is on the Indians' side,'' said Ralph W. Standbrook,
Cayuga County Legislature chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Other counties participating in the trip to Washington, D.C.,
are Madison, Oneida, Seneca, Greene and Sullivan, said Stephen J.
Acquario, general counsel to the New York State Association of
Counties. The group organized the trip after meeting Friday in
Utica.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an opportunity for us to work together as communities
from land-claim areas and forge together a unified response,'' said
C. Lee Hinkleman Sr., an Oneida County spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   County leaders have concerns about many of the same land
claim-related issues. Their concerns include the sovereign
government status given to Native American reservations, collection
of property and sales taxes on those reservations, gaming compacts
and the impact reservations could have on property values and
environmental and zoning laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's important we know which laws they have to abide
and which ones they don't,'' said Cayuga County Legislator Herbert
D. Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   County officials may need a better understanding of federal
laws, particularly those granting sovereignty to Native American
tribes, said Clint Halftown, a spokesman for the Cayuga Indian
Nation. Their sovereign status, for example, exempts Native
Americans, who live on territorial land from paying property taxes,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government also must side with tribes filing land
claims because the Bureau of Indian Affairs has a trust
relationship with this country's Native Americans and must act in
their best interests, Halftown said.
</P>
<P>
   County officials are making the trip two months after a federal
court jury in Syracuse recommended a $36.9 million award to the
Cayugas to compensate the tribe for 64,015 acres of lost ancestral
lands in Cayuga and Seneca counties. A final judgment on the award
will be made by a judge this summer.
</P>
<P>
   In Madison and Oneida counties, the Oneida Indian Nation is
suing to regain title to 250,000 acres in those two counties that
the tribe claims was illegally purchased by the state. The U.S.
Supreme Court found in 1985 that the land was taken illegally and
ruled the Oneidas were entitled to compensation. Last week,
out-of-court negotiations collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Acquario said the local delegation hopes to meet with
Congressional representatives from the land claim areas, including
Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Charles Schumer.

<HEADLINE> Reds 10, Rockies 3  </HEADLINE>
By AARON J. LOPEZ, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Ken Griffey Jr. wasted no time getting started on
his next milestone, hitting his 13th career grand slam Tuesday
night to lead the Cincinnati Reds over the Colorado Rockies 10-3.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, who on Monday became the youngest player to hit 400
home runs, was 2-for-4 with five RBIs. He has homered in three
straight games.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey is 10th on the career slam list, tied with Harold
Baines, Robin Ventura and Mark McGwire for the lead among active
players. His previous slam was last April 30.
</P>
<P>
   Dmitri Young added four hits, including a three-run homer for
the Reds, who have at least one home run in each of their first
nine games. That was plenty for Ron Villone (2-0) as the
left-hander held the Rockies to two runs and four hits in seven
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Young's homer off Brian Bohanon (0-1) helped the Reds build a
5-2 lead after three and Griffey broke the game open after singles
by D.T. Cromer, Chris Stynes and Barry Larkin.
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon gave way to former Reds reliever Gabe White, but Griffey
foiled the strategy when he hit an 0-1 pitch into the second deck
beyond right-center field.
</P>
<P>
   Like most hitters, Griffey has taken a liking to Coors Field,
where he is 10-for-26 with five homers and 15 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Villone also looked comfortable in his first start at Coors. His
only trouble came in the third when Brian Hunter and Mike Lansing
executed a double steal and Hunter scored when Larkin couldn't
handle the throw to second. Larry Walker, 3-for-4 with two RBIs,
followed with a run-scoring single that cut the lead to 5-2.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Reds 2B Pokey Reese did not play because of a bruised left
elbow. He hopes to return to the lineup for Wednesday's series
finale. ... Cincinnati 1B Sean Casey, who broke his right thumb in
the final exhibition game of the spring, plans to hit off a tee
Friday. He is eligible to come off the 15-day disabled list April
17. ... Hal Morris hit a pinch homer in the eighth for the Reds to
get his 500th career RBI. ... Colorado's 7-5 victory Monday marked
the lowest-scoring home opener in the team's eight-year history.
The previous low was 13 runs last year. ... Bohanon gave up eight
earned runs in 3 1-3 innings. His ERA in two games is 13.50.

<HEADLINE> Royals 7, Orioles 5, 12 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG TUCKER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) --Brian Johnson's two-run homer with one
out in the 12th inning gave the Kansas City Royals a 7-5 victory
over the Baltimore Orioles on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals, who had the potential winning run in scoring
position in the ninth, 10th and 11th inning, got an infield single
from Joe Randa to lead off the 12th against Tim Worrell (1-1). One
out later, Johnson hit a shot to left-center for his second home
run of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Santiago (1-0) pitched the 12th for the win.
</P>
<P>
   Randa's three-run homer off reliever Al Reyes in the eighth tied
the game at 5. The Royals looked like they would win it in the
ninth, when they loaded the bases with one out against B.J. Ryan.
Jermaine Dye grounded into a forceout and Mike Sweeney flied out to
end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken homered in his first at-bat, leaving him five hits
away from 3,000. Ripken, who started the season with 2,991 hits,
got home run No. 404 on a 2-0 pitch from rookie right-hander Chad
Durbin. He was 1-for-5.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles led 5-2 when Reyes relieved Sidney Ponson and gave
up a leadoff double to Carlos Febles to start the eighth. One out
later, Jermaine Dye walked to set to up Randa's two-out homer.
</P>
<P>
   After Ripken homered in the second, Will Clark walked, Mike
Bordick doubled and Brady Anderson made it 3-0 with a two-run
single.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sweeney, who started the game tied with Toronto's Tony
Batista and Baltimore's Charles Johnson for the AL home run lead,
hit his fifth with one out in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Beltran doubled to lead off the sixth and eventually
scored from third when Ripken was charged with a throwing error
from third base on Sweeney's grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson hit a solo home run in the fifth and Harold Baines made
it 5-2 with an RBI single in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Durbin, who gave up just one hit in six innings in his first
major league start last week at Toronto, allowed four runs and five
hits in 5 2-3 innings. He walked four and struck out two.
</P>
<P>
   Ponson allowed two runs and five hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Ripken's homer gave him 1,575 RBIs, tying him with Jake
Beckley for 29th on the career list. ... Last April, the Orioles
went 6-16. ... Baltimore 2B Delino DeShields made a terrific
run-saving play in the fourth when he dove to his right to knock
down Dye's smash, then threw him out by half a step. One pitch
later, Sweeney homered. ... When Royals DH Mark Quinn flied out in
the fourth, it was the first time in four at-bats he hadn't
doubled. ... Anderson's home run was his 183rd, moving him past
Rafael Palmeiro and Ken Singleton for 5th place for the Orioles.
... The Royals have hit 19 doubles in the last six games.

<HEADLINE> Some deals emerge, but big-ticket items still outstanding  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Legislators trying to finish negotiating a
new state budget removed one troublesome item from their list of
outstanding issues -- an expanded prescription drug program for
older New Yorkers -- but a host of others were still unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are some complicated areas out there,'' state Assembly
Speaker Sheldon Silver conceded Tuesday after he and Senate
Majority Leader Joseph Bruno extended the legislative conference
committees by 24 hours until today. That was in hopes of compelling
the seven committees yet to complete their negotiations to finalize
deals.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very difficult process at this stage, but we're
making progress,'' Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators on Tuesday announced a deal to expand the state's
prescription drug program for senior citizens. The deal will
increase participation in the Elderly Pharmaceutical Insurance
Coverage (EPIC) program from the current 115,000 to an estimated
215,000 within three years and cost the state an extra $180 million
when fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Agreements on other major outstanding issues in the budget were
harder to come by, however, despite days of closed-door negotiating
by legislative staffers and aides to Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative sources said a proposed $3.8 billion bond act to
fund roads, bridges and mass transit -- and a five-year, $17.1
billion capital plan for mass transit which the bond act is a
crucial component of -- was causing agreements to stall on other
unresolved big-ticket items in the 2000-01 state budget.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators are trying to make a deal on a state budget worth
about $78 billion for the fiscal year which began April 1. Their
leaders want to have the spending plan adopted by the start of
Passover, on April 19.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding and simplifying the EPIC program had for days been
talked about by staffers for the conference committee discussing
health spending in the 2000-01 budget.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement announced Tuesday, annual income limits for
eligibility under EPIC will be expanded from $18,500 to $35,000 for
senior citizens living alone and from $24,400 to $50,000 for
married couples.
</P>
<P>
   Copays and fees charged seniors to enroll in EPIC will be
reduced, and the complicated rules of the program will be
simplified, the Senate-Assembly agreement stipulated.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers must be 65 or older to qualify for EPIC.
</P>
<P>
   Both the state Assembly and Senate had proposed improvements to
the program. The plan agreed to Tuesday is closer to the Senate's
approach.
</P>
<P>
   Word of other deals came in dribs and drabs Tuesday from the
nine legislative conference committees discussing spending in
various sections of the budget like health, education and social
services.
</P>
<P>
   The committee responsible for mental health spending, for
instance, said it had agreed to restore $7.6 million not included
in Pataki's proposed budget to pay the salaries for 215 mental
health officials working in hospitals, clinics and other treatment
centers. The cost of those officials are ''shared'' between the
state and the counties, and advocates for the mentally ill lobbied
hard for their salaries to be restored.
</P>
<P>
   That committee said it also agreed to a 1.5 percent
cost-of-living adjustment for nonresidential providers of mental
health and alcohol and substance abuse services. That will cost an
additional $10.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The committee responsible for agriculture said it had again
restored state funding for research at Cornell University into
various farm hazards, including golden nematodes and the cow
disease known as ''blue tongue.''
</P>
<P>
   In other conference committees, legislators would say little
about the details of behind-the-scenes negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to get into numbers,'' Assemblyman Vito Lopez,
D-Brooklyn, said about talks over housing programs.

<HEADLINE> State releases zip-code tracking of breast cancer cases  </HEADLINE>
By L. ANNE NEWELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- State officials say the latest step in a
$4-million-dollar cancer study could bring them closer to finding
out what causes cancer. But at least one lawmaker says it's just
another sidestep from the Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   The state Health Department on Tuesday unveiled a zip code
breakdown of breast cancer occurrences across New York that's the
first of its kind in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Health Department officials cautioned the breakdowns provide
little insight into what causes the cancer that each year claims
the lives of 3,500 New York women. The statistics are only a tool
by which health experts hope to ultimately answer that question,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of the questions that need to be asked are those we must
now ask,'' said state Health Commissioner Dr. Antonia Novello.
''Now we really need to start the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Cancer groups were generally supportive and said the research
will provide them with better information to serve the public.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm actually very pleased,'' said Geri Barish, president of
One in Nine, the Long Island Breast Cancer Action Coalition. ''I
think that the Department of Health has done a tremendous job in
giving us some of the information that we have asked for.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You can see your community and what's really going on there,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Brodsky, a Westchester County Democrat and chairman
of the state Assembly's Environmental Conservation Committee, said
that information could be much better.
</P>
<P>
   The maps are ''completely, completely bogus,'' he said. ''This
was always about identifying cancer clusters in neighborhoods ...
By doing it by zip code, they're hiding the truth from
neighborhoods all across the state.''
</P>
<P>
   The Health Department attracted some criticism when it released
its first set of maps in December that showed a county-by-county
breakdown of breast, lung and colorectal cancer. Critics said the
county breakdown was too expansive an area to detect the clusters
of the disease that some believe can be produced by fouled drinking
water, pesticides, industrial chemicals or other factors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything that they've released, we've dragged out of them,''
Brodsky said of the Health Department. ''It's taken them two and a
half years to come out with this?''
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact is, the Republicans have done in 2 1/2 years what the
Democrats couldn't do in 20 years,'' countered John Signor, a
Health Department spokesman. ''These are the most accurate,
up-to-date maps in the nation and it's exactly what the cancer
advocates have been calling for. The fact is, Brodsky is guilty of
cancer map envy.''
</P>
<P>
   Activists like Blair Horner of the New York Public Interest
Research Group said the new maps are no better than any prior ones
if they're not followed up with immediate research into what causes
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''From our perspective, it's like this was a public health flare
shot up today that should attract researchers' attention,'' Horner
said. ''The sooner they start working on the next maps, the sooner
we can see if there are any consistencies in environmental
hazards.''
</P>
<P>
   The maps are based on the number of women who developed breast
cancer in each of New York's approximately 1,400 zip codes from
1993 through 1997. Regions were assigned colors that show that
number compared to the number of incidences the Health Department
expected to find.
</P>
<P>
   The maps show a higher-than-normal breast cancer rate in:
</P>
<P>
   --Northwestern Erie and southwestern Niagara counties
</P>
<P>
   --Eastern Monroe and western Wayne counties
</P>
<P>
   --Mid/Southern Rockland and western Westchester counties
</P>
<P>
   --Southern Westchester County
</P>
<P>
   --Manhattan, on the eastern side of Central Park
</P>
<P>
   --Southern Brooklyn
</P>
<P>
   --Northern Nassau County
</P>
<P>
   --Southwestern Nassau County
</P>
<P>
   --Southeastern Nassau County and southwestern Suffolk County
</P>
<P>
   --The east end of Suffolk County, including Mount Sinai, Port
Jefferson and Coram.
</P>
<P>
   Novello emphasized that women should not worry about their
health just because they live in a high incidence area and that
subsequent research as part of the state's Cancer Surveillance
Improvement Initiative will help answer the questions raised by the
zip code maps.
</P>
<P>
   Novello and other officials were hesitant to discuss any
theories on what led to the increased cancer rates in some areas
and not others.
</P>
<P>
   They emphasized in the meantime that if women are worried about
their health, they should talk with a health care provider about
personal risk factors, find out if their relatives have developed
cancer and look at screening programs in their communities.

<HEADLINE> New York's top court upholds state's Internet predator law  </HEADLINE>
By L. ANNE NEWELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Prosecutors say a state Court of Appeals'
decision to uphold a state law designed to keep adults from using
the Internet to target minors for sex is a precedent for future
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is most definitely a precedent,'' Oneida County District
Attorney Michael Arcuri said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Arcuri prosecuted the case against Thomas Foley, a 54-year-old
radio engineer from Grand Island who was the first person convicted
under the 1996 Internet predator law.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very pleased with the decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The court's ruling represents a critical step forward in
protecting our children from pedophiles in the Internet age,''
state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   Foley's lawyer said the decision was disappointing for his
client, but important from a First Amendment standpoint, since the
court emphasized people must be aware they are communicating with a
minor in order to be charged under the law.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's important because it limits the scope of protected
speech that can be criminalized,'' Roger Wilcox Jr. said. ''That
does have significant ramifications for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilcox said he was talking with Foley about a possible appeal to
the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Wilcox had argued the law, which makes it a felony for a person
to knowingly use the Internet to invite or induce a minor into
having sexual relations, was overbroad, vague and unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals disagreed, saying the law does exactly what
it is intended to do.
</P>
<P>
   It took effect Nov. 1, 1996, and the state police Computer Crime
Unit conducted a sting operation beginning Oct. 28 and continuing
through November during which an officer posed as a 15-year-old
girl purportedly from Utica named ''Aimee.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley, using the screen name ''JustMee,'' began a sexual
conversation with the ''teen'' in a chat room called ''Kids of
Family Sex.'' Foley then sent the officer several pictures of
preteen girls engaged in sexual acts with men. He also told
''Aimee'' that he wanted to have sex with her and the two made
preliminary plans to meet in Buffalo, where the ''teen'' supposedly
had cousins.
</P>
<P>
   Foley was arrested during his fifth and final chat with
''Aimee'' on Nov. 22, when police executed a search warrant and
found him typing on his computer. They got his name by serving a
subpoena on his Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   He was convicted of two counts each of attempting to disseminate
indecent materials to minors and promoting a sexual performance by
a child and sentenced to two to six years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   He appealed the decision to the Appellate Division of the state
Supreme Court, arguing people who unintentionally proposition a
minor could be charged, and that the law unduly burdens interstate
trade and imposes New York's community standards nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The Appellate Division disagreed with all three arguments and
the Court of Appeals concurred, pointing out the law only seeks to
punish those who ''intentionally'' target minors.
</P>
<P>
   The court also derided Foley's commerce argument.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are hard pressed to ascertain any legitimate commerce that
is derived from the intentional transmission of sexually graphic
images to minors for the purpose of luring them into sexual
activity,'' wrote Judge Richard Wesley in the court's 7-0 decision.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the moral standards argument, Wesley wrote, ''It
is difficult to envision a situation where this conduct would not
be considered harmful to minors outside New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley is being held at the Gowanda correctional facility in Erie
County. He could be released from prison as early as May 18, 2001.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton blasts mayor; vows best campaign ever  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton was headed for
Buffalo today to visit a school and a senior citizens center, and
to highlight the fact that while she is campaigning upstate, her
Senate rival is elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said he was scrapping a
campaign trip today to Rochester and Buffalo in favor of attending
the New York Yankees home opener.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the New York City mayor was a poor leader fit more
for the gridiron than the Senate. And, the first lady, who stumbled
early on in her first-ever campaign, bragged to more than 1,000
cheering public employee union leaders that she was ''going to run
the single best campaign that this state or any state has ever
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If you stick with me, and I know you will for this campaign,
then we will go into the Senate come January 2001,'' she told the
New York leaders of the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, it marked her third day in the past five
campaigning in upstate New York, a generally conservative area of
the state that is expected to be a key battleground in her race
with Giuliani. Upstate represents about 45 percent of the vote in
statewide elections.
</P>
<P>
   While Giuliani made a brief stop in Binghamton on Friday for a
news conference and a speech, Clinton has been crisscrossing
upstate New York. Aides said the mayor, an avid baseball fan who
particularly loves the Yankees, has never missed a Yankees or Mets
home opener.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's had a tough couple of weeks. It might be good for him to
go to a game,'' Clinton told a news conference Tuesday in Albany
following her appearance a few blocks away before the union
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's poll numbers have been declining in recent weeks and
his earlier lead has vanished. One recent poll showed the first
lady with a slight lead while others have shown the contest to be a
statistical tie.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm trying to reach as many voters as I possibly can in every
part of the state,'' she said when asked whether she was spending
more time around the state than he was.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's cut the guy some slack,'' said Monroe County GOP
Chairman Stephen Minarik, whose wife had helped arrange the
Rochester women's event for Giuliani that got postponed. ''He's
already rescheduled the event'' for June 12.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans weren't as forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ''If upstate is being asked to tolerate his liberalism, you
would think he'd at least tolerate missing opening day,'' said GOP
strategist Nelson Warfield, who is not involved in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wasn't cutting the mayor any slack, launching what may
have been her harshest attack of the campaign on his mayoral
policies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have leadership in that city that cares about people
who need an extra hand to get up and get going,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a mayor who perverts welfare reform,'' she told the
union leaders.
</P>
<P>
   At her later news conference, Clinton said the Giuliani
administration has not done enough to train welfare recipients and
has shown a desire to ''cut people off'' from benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani campaign issued a statement saying Clinton
''prefers to increase dependency'' when it comes to welfare. ''Her
position on welfare is consistent with her left-wing ideology over
the past 25 years,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   During her often fiery speech to union leaders, Clinton even
managed to bring up the Yankees, and the Mets, as she defended
herself against carpetbagger charges and questioned Giuliani's
temperament. ''If we were trying to recruit somebody for the
Yankees or the Mets we wouldn't care where she was born,'' the
first lady said. ''To carry that sports analogy probably a step too
far, some might think that the Senate was the big leagues and if
you're going to go there, you've got to be prepared to play.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't go out on the diamond and think that you're playing
football,'' she added. ''You've got to be able to work with your
fellow senators.''

<HEADLINE> Gay Republican group wants Plattsburgh mayor to be a healer withBush  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PLATTSBURGH, N.Y. (AP) -- The state's only openly gay mayor is
trying to help smooth relations between Texas Governor George W.
Bush and a gay Republican group.
</P>
<P>
   Plattsburgh Mayor Daniel Stewart, a Republican and a supporter
of Bush for the presidential race, planned to meet with Bush twice
today and once more Thursday in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was criticized after he said last November he probably
would not meet with the Log Cabin Republicans, but last month
reversed that statement.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart has also changed course on Bush's snub. Last month he
defended Bush's decision not to meet with the group, saying the Log
Cabin Republicans had endorsed Arizona Sen. John McCain. Later
Stewart said Bush should have met with the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Tafel, executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans,
said that if anyone can bring his group and Bush together, it is
Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ''Having Dan there is very reassuring because he has shown that
he is very concerned about policies and making things better,''
Tafel told the Plattsburgh Press-Republican. ''There has been some
bruised feelings on both sides, and I think he (Stewart) can lay
the groundwork for future discussions, and he has the potential to
be a healer.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who said he is one of about a dozen gay people meeting
with Bush, said that he will tell the governor that ''it is time to
make sure that all Americans are included in the big picture.''
</P>
<P>
   The Log Cabins need to hold tight and let this meeting go
forward and let us try to accomplish getting open some doors so we
can all move forward as a unified party,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, as well as his chief opponent, Vice President Al Gore,
does not support gay marriages. Stewart favors some civil-union
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Tafel said he hopes today's meeting can clear up Bush's position
on administrative appointments for gays.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he will appoint people to his administration who have
the same feelings he does on national issues, and I think he is a
fair man,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   ''(Bush) has to realize that it's not just gays. It's our
friends and families too that are affected by issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor denied that he was looking for a job himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every one of us that is going down there is being chastised as
looking for appointments, but that's not why I am going at all,''
Stewart said.

<HEADLINE> Pataki, chief judge back court reform process  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- People navigating through the state's
complex and confusing court system would have a much easier time if
the multi-level courts are consolidated, Gov. George Pataki says.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's only so much you can do administratively. There comes
a time when you have to take the next step by legislation or in
this case constitutional amendment,'' said Pataki, who joined Chief
Judge Judith Kaye Tuesday at a news conference to promote court
reform at Albany County Family Court.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators of the state court system, which Kaye heads, have
long sought to consolidate the nine trial level courts into two
trial courts -- Supreme Court and District Court.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye used a domestic violence case as an example to illustrate
the ills of the state's complex court system. She said a victim can
go to Family Court to get an order of protection. But to get a
divorce, she would have to go to the Supreme Court. After that's
done, it's back to Family Court for custody issues.
</P>
<P>
   And if the victim chooses the wrong court, she may have to start
all over again, Kaye said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is time to change that sorry picture,'' Kaye said. ''As a
system, it's confusing, it's inefficient and it raises the price of
justice for citizens who just want to get their cases decided so
they get on with their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki first said he supported court restructuring in his 1998
State of the State address, but he had not actively campaigned for
Kaye's reform plan prior to Tuesday's joint appearance with the
chief judge.
</P>
<P>
   Under the amendment proposal, the New York City Civil Court, New
York City Criminal Court, Civil Court and District Court would be
merged into a statewide District Court. The Supreme Court level
would include duties currently handled by the Supreme Court, the
Court of Claims, Family Court, Surrogate's Court and County Court.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki also called for creating a fifth judicial department to
help relieve the heavy caseload of the Second Department, which
covers Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island and Nassau, Suffolk,
Westchester, Dutchess, Rockland, Putnam and Orange counties.
</P>
<P>
   In order for a constitutional amendment to win approval, both
houses of the state Legislature must pass it in successive terms,
followed by voters in statewide referendum ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye said there is still time this year for the Assembly and the
Senate to pass a restructuring plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''This should be the year, this must be the year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we don't do it this year, the earliest we'll be able to do
this will be in 2003, and that would be a tragedy for the people of
New York,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   The state Assembly in 1998 passed legislation to reform the
state's court system and is now ''waiting for the Senate majority
to act,'' said Assemblywoman Helene Weinstein, a Brooklyn Democrat
who chairs her chamber's judiciary committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly's version of the constitutional amendment also
called for transfer of $40 million from the state's abandoned
property fund to provide legal representation to poor New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein said increasing 18-B fees, or ''assigned counsel
fees'' should be included as part of a court reform package.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not only do we change the flow chart, but we should also
provide the resources,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Assigned counsel fees now total $40 an hour for in-court work
and $25 an hour for out-of-court representation. Critics say that
fee schedule is outdated and that court-appointed lawyers only make
a fraction of what private defense lawyers command.

<HEADLINE> Telestra Aims for Asia Alliance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Telstra Corp. announced Wednesday it is
in an advanced stage of preparing a memorandum of understanding
with Hong Kong's Pacific Century CyberWorks to form an Asia-Pacific
telecom alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would be Telstra's most significant expansion into Asia
and would give it new growth options outside the highly competitive
Australian telecom market.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Century CyberWorks, which aims to use its satellite
technology to become the main broadband Internet service provider
in Asia, is a unit of Pacific Century Regional Development of
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Australian newspaper The Financial Review reported Wednesday
Telstra was preparing an Asian alliance worth $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that they are in talks with Cyberworks in Asia shows
that Telstra is now in a position where they realize there are
advantages in trying to build their business beyond the boundaries
of Australia,'' Jamie Spiteri, broker with Shaw Stockbroking Ltd.
in Sydney said.
</P>
<P>
   Trading of both companies' shares was halted. The Hong Kong
exchange cited a pending announcement ''in relation to a potential
partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Century Cyberworks last month posted a net profit of
$44.5 million in the year ended Dec. 31, boosted mostly by its
Internet-related investments.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Century CyberWorks, run by billionaire Li Ka-shing's son
Richard Li, announced in February it would buy Hong Kong's leading
telecom company, Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT, in a deal that was initially
valued at $38.1 billion in stock or $35.9 billion in a combination
of cash and stock.

<HEADLINE> Raytheon Predicts Lower 1Q Earnings  </HEADLINE>
By JAY LINDSAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Raytheon is trying to sell its engineering and
construction division, where the company said contract problems are
dragging down first-quarter profits.
</P>
<P>
   The profit warning Tuesday was the latest bad news at
Lexington-based Raytheon, but analysts said plans to jettison the
troubled Raytheon Engineering &AMP; Constructors division would be
welcomed by the market.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that they're selling the business will be relatively
well received,'' said Joseph Nadol of Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette.
''They should really focus on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   As of the first quarter, the engineering unit's results won't be
reported in continuing operations. That would put first-quarter
earnings at 23 to 27 cents per diluted share, on par with analysts'
expectations, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial were expecting
24 cents per share for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the loss attributable to the engineering
division was 15 to 20 cents per diluted share.
</P>
<P>
   The Engineering &AMP; Constructors division builds large-scale
government and industrial projects, with a light transit rail
system in New Jersey and a hydroelectric dam in the Philippines to
its credit.
</P>
<P>
   Nadol said the division's problems stem from four international
contracts, its most troublesome a fixed-price contract with United
Kingdom-based Entergy to build a natural gas-fired power plant
outside London.
</P>
<P>
   The project is at least $50 million over budget and overdue.
Raytheon is liable for lost profits due to late project completion,
which could add millions more to the company's losses, Nadol said.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon chairman and chief executive officer Daniel Burnham
said the engineering unit's business is not central to the
company's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ''A sale, joint venture or spin-off of RE&AMP;C is in the best
interests of Raytheon shareholders and RE&AMP;C,'' he said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon spokesman David Polk declined to comment on any talks
Raytheon was having regarding the divestiture of RE&AMP;C.
</P>
<P>
   RE&AMP;C has about 7,600 employees, about 7.2 percent of the
company's work force of 105,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a relatively small part of the whole company,'' Nadol
said, adding that the defense operations that make up the bulk of
Raytheon's business seem to be performing adequately.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not the worst news that's recently come out of the
company,'' Nadol said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was particularly tough for Raytheon. In the last
quarter of 1999, Raytheon's earnings fell 79 percent from the same
period in 1998, dropping to $72 million from $341 million.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon's profits fell from $844 million in 1998 to $404
million last year. Meanwhile, its stock has fallen from a 52-week
high of $76.56\ in July, trading in the $20 range for the past
couple of months.

<HEADLINE> Adam's Mark Must Restore Reputation  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE SCHNEIDER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- When federal officials announced a
landmark settlement last month of two discrimination lawsuits
against the Adam's Mark hotel chain, company executives said they
were looking forward to putting the allegations behind them.
</P>
<P>
   But the toughest part may still be ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis-based Adam's Mark chain, which has of 21-hotels in
13 states, must rebuild its tarnished image and try to woo back
customers who deserted it after federal and state officials accused
the company of discriminating against black guests.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials must apologize, reach out to the community
they offended and take measures to show the corporate culture is
changing, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The most important thing company officials can do to restore
public confidence is admit they did something wrong, said Jim
Adamson, CEO of the Denny's restaurant chain, which faced
discrimination accusations several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Americans are very forgiving if you admit you have a
problem,'' Adamson said in a telephone interview from his
Spartanburg, S.C., office. ''You have to be willing to talk
straight and bear the consequences and be willing to tell the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Adam's Mark officials have had trouble admitting
wrongdoing, critics say.
</P>
<P>
   Five black vacationers last year sued the Adam's Mark, saying
the hotel chain singled them out as security risks during the 1999
Black College Reunion and made them -- but not white guests -- wear
orange wristbands to get into the hotel. Black reunion guests also
were allegedly charged more than other special event guests and had
to pay cash in full to reserve rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Justice Department filed a separate lawsuit, saying
there was a pattern of discrimination at the hotel chain.
</P>
<P>
   The company agreed in a March 21 settlement to pay $8 million to
former guests of its Daytona Beach hotel and four historically
black colleges, revise policies and seek minority customers as well
as hire an outside firm to monitor any discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   However, shortly after the settlement was announced, the Adam's
Mark issued a statement saying that while ''the company has never
done anything wrong, we apologize for any actions that may have
made any of our guests feel uncomfortable or unwelcome.''
</P>
<P>
   In media interviews, company officials have been defiant,
admitting no wrongdoing and claiming they would have won in court.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our record already is good. We don't need to restore (public)
confidence,'' Fred S. Kummer III, the company's vice president of
corporate affairs, said in a telephone interview. ''Our company has
a record that should be envied. We should not be made into a
culprit.''
</P>
<P>
   Such statements raise doubts about whether the Adam's Mark has
accepted responsibility for its actions, said James Buford,
president of the Urban League of Metropolitan St. Louis, a civil
rights group.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they spent $8 million to get the monkey off their
back. They spent $8 million to get rid of the bad publicity,''
Buford said in a telephone interview. ''They're hellbent on making
everyone understand that they didn't do anything wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how the company handles its public reaction to the
case, Abraham Pizam, a professor of hospitality management at the
University of Central Florida in Orlando, said the Adam's Mark's
association with racism in the public mind will fade away.
</P>
<P>
   ''To be honest, people have short memories, unless the customers
who were offended will boycott and create an atmosphere of
hostility,'' Pizam said. ''If they were to do nothing, I can assure
you it can be forgotten in a year or two years.''

<HEADLINE> Study Finds Oil Prices Will Fall  </HEADLINE>
BY BRUCE STANLEY, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Increased OPEC oil production and a mild winter
that eased consumer demand for heating oil are contributing to at
least temporary relief from painfully high crude prices, according
to a respected industry study.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices have fallen since OPEC members agreed last month to
open the spigots on exports, adding 500,000 new barrels per day and
giving refineries an incentive to buy more of the oil they need to
make gasoline, the International Energy Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   However, any relief at the pump for motorists in oil-importing
nations could be brief, the study said. The agency said even more
oil will be needed later this year, during the peak driving season
in industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The second half of the year will need to see higher
production,'' the IEA said bluntly. The Paris-based IEA is part of
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group
of the world's wealthiest countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a step in the right direction, but it's only a first
step,'' said Julian Lee, an analyst at the Center for Global Energy
Studies in London.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, gasoline prices in the United States have
started to fall in anticipation of more OPEC oil reaching refiners.
The average price at the pump for all grades of gasoline dipped
nearly 2{ cents per gallon during the past two weeks to just over
$1.57, according to the latest Lundberg Survey of 10,000 stations
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. oil companies have been under pressure to pass along any
savings. Following OPEC's March 28 decision to boost production,
President Clinton urged the companies ''to do everything they can
to bring the savings to consumers as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson reiterated in
a speech and congressional testimony that regular gas alone had
peaked at $1.53 a gallon and would likely retreat to around $1.39
by Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   But the international report Tuesday warned that it will take
even more oil production to hold down prices in the second half of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for gasoline in the United States, Europe and Japan will
likely soak up any additional oil brought to market, the study
predicted, adding that an additional 1 million daily barrels would
be needed in the third quarter to satisfy the thirst of drivers and
to rebuild refiners' inventories.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices were rising Tuesday in futures markets after sinking
to five-month lows on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC production cuts in 1999 had sent crude oil prices tripling
over the past year to the highest level since the Gulf War. Prices
have been coming down for about a month as it became clear OPEC
would undo the production cuts it made in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
   West Texas Intermediate crude for May delivery rose 29 cents to
close at $24.14 a barrel Tuesday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange -- down 30 percent from its March 8 intraday peak of $34.37
a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   North Sea Brent crude rose to $21.67 a barrel in late trading
Tuesday on the International Petroleum Exchange in London, a gain
of 37 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the last month, the prospects for oil markets have begun
to look better for both consumers and producers,'' the IEA said.
</P>
<P>
   Warm weather in the first quarter of the year and larger than
expected supplies from non-OPEC sources meant that global oil
inventories dropped by much less than the agency had anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for oil eased to 76.2 million barrels per day during the
first quarter, the IEA reported, down 0.8 percent from the last
three months of 1999. Global supplies rose 1.1 percent to 75.1
million barrels over the same period, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Refiners are once again finding it profitable to increase
production, and the IEA forecast that inventories would rise
substantially in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Clouding the horizon is the sharp rise in expected demand for
gasoline this summer, when large numbers of Western motorists take
to the roads.
</P>
<P>
   Lee predicted that Brent prices would creep up to about $25 a
barrel by May, as refineries gear up their production.
</P>
<P>
   If Brent prices are to stabilize at $20-$21 a barrel, the world
needs to see an additional 1 million barrels of crude each day, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC members are raising their output by an estimated 1.72
million barrels per day. But the increase actually is closer to
500,000 new barrels a day because OPEC members already were pumping
1.2 million barrels above their official quotas.
</P>
<P>
   This cheating worsened ahead of the March meeting in Vienna,
Austria, of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries with
the group complying with only 66 percent of its earlier output
cuts, according to the IEA. OPEC's compliance rate was 72 percent
in February.
</P>
<P>
   Although non-OPEC producers Mexico and Norway have also boosted
production, any additional oil to satisfy demand later this year
would have to come from OPEC, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC members will meet again June 21 to assess whether they need
to increase production further.

<HEADLINE> Trouble With Uranium Processing Co.  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Less than two years after the government sold
its uranium business, the private company it created to take on the
job is mired in financial quicksand. The deal is also jeopardizing
a crucial nuclear security agreement with Russia, critics say.
</P>
<P>
   USEC Inc.'s first 20 months as a private company have been
anything but smooth. Its stock has dropped 70 percent, its credit
rating is in junk bond territory, and its earnings have nosedived.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the financial turmoil, lawmakers and others are questioning
the sale. A congressional investigation has been under way for a
year, with the first public hearings scheduled this week.
</P>
<P>
   While investors have lost millions of dollars, some of the
people who pushed hardest for an initial stock offering have
profited handsomely.
</P>
<P>
   ''A number of lobbyists, company insiders and investment bankers
made a killing financially,'' said Charles Lewis, director of the
Center for Public Integrity, a private government watchdog.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Wall Street bankers, Washington lawyers and lobbyists --
many with close ties to the Clinton administration -- earned more
than $75 million on the $1.9 billion sale, according to contracts
and interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Among those talking up the stock offering in 1998 on Capitol
Hill and in the White House were Susan Thomases, a New York lawyer
and confidante of Hillary Rodham Clinton, and Greg Simon, formerly
Vice President Al Gore's domestic policy adviser. The law firm of
Skadden Arps, which represented President Clinton in the Paula
Jones case, was USEC's lead attorney in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But no one pushed harder for a USEC sale on Wall Street than
William ''Nick'' Timbers, a former investment banker whose 1991
report for the Energy Department touted the idea of privatizing the
government's uranium business. Now USEC's chairman, he earns $1.2
million a year and so far has made $151,000 from USEC stock
dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Participants and transcripts of private USEC board meetings
indicate Timbers argued strongly against selling the government
enterprise to private bidders, pressuring instead for an initial
public offering of stock. Among the rejected suitors was defense
giant Lockheed Martin, which had operated an enrichment plant as a
government contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Timbers also touted an experimental laser technology, known as
AVLIS, that he predicted would be in operation by 2005 and reduce
electricity costs by 95 percent, helping make USEC profitable. But
a year after the stock sale, AVLIS was abandoned as too expensive,
prompting some stockholders and critics to complain they had been
misled -- a charge the company denied.
</P>
<P>
   USEC Vice President Charles Yulish, the company's spokesman,
said the payments to underwriters and legal advisers were in line
with a sale of USEC's size. He dismissed criticism as part of a
''relentless conspiracy theory'' promoted by the domestic uranium
mining industry and the union representing plant workers.
</P>
<P>
   Timbers declined repeated requests for an interview. But he and
other USEC executives have blamed the company's problems on
declining uranium prices, high enrichment costs, increased
competition from European enrichment companies and losses from the
Russia uranium deal.
</P>
<P>
   The company's problems are not just a matter of finances -- they
could also affect national security.
</P>
<P>
   The government's enrichment plants -- now operated by USEC in
Paducah, Ky., and Piketon, Ohio -- for years provided uranium for
weapons and submarines. Now USEC sells enriched uranium for
commercial power reactors, accounting for a third of all such sales
worldwide and revenue last year of $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, while still owned by the government, USEC became the
U.S. agent for the Russian uranium deal, a cornerstone of American
attempts to get Russia to dispose of some of its huge nuclear
weapons material while keeping it out of the hands of terrorists or
rogue states.
</P>
<P>
   But the arrangement has been a money loser because the contract
requires USEC to pay Russia more for the uranium than the company
can sell it for in the depressed market. Last fall, USEC sought
$200 million in government help, but was rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   USEC has recently beefed up its lobbying corps, hiring former
White House Counsel Jack Quinn and former Senate Energy Committee
Chairman Bennett Johnston, D-La., among others. Critics speculate
USEC may be preparing another plea for government assistance if it
fails to persuade Russia to cut its prices.
</P>
<P>
   With growing uncertainty about the company's long-term survival,
some members of Congress are concerned the government may yet have
to step in with a multibillion-dollar bailout. Even Sen. Pete
Domenici, R-N.M., who co-sponsored the privatization legislation,
now refers to it as ''this disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the government was making hefty profits -- $1.2
billion between 1994 into 1998 -- when it owned USEC. But that was
before the uranium market went bust because of declining demand and
huge supplies, the company's defenders say. Critics contend USEC
contributed to the downward spiral by signaling it would sell a
large amount of the natural uranium it inherited from the
government to maintain cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   ''We sold a thriving government enterprise that isn't so
thriving anymore,'' said William Burton, an energy lawyer and a
member of the presidentially appointed board that approved the
sale. Burton opposed the sale, arguing that its impact on the
Russia uranium agreement had not been examined sufficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has privately told
associates the privatization was a mistake. And last fall, he
accused USEC of undercutting the Russia nonproliferation agreement
by selling large amounts of its own uranium stockpile.
</P>
<P>
   USEC executives said the $25 million in sales over three months
last year reflected several years of contracts. But the company's
large uranium holdings -- $700 million worth -- and its strategy to
sell it on the open market are still of concern to nonproliferation
experts.
</P>
<P>
   Yulish disputed claims that USEC has sought to undermine the
Russia deal, noting that USEC has already accepted 81 tons of
weapons-grade uranium -- enough for 3,200 nuclear warheads -- and is
committed to accept 30 tons a year under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce Russia's nuclear arsenal, the United States in the
early 1990s agreed to help Moscow sell 500 metric tons of highly
enriched uranium from the former Soviet weapons stockpile. Once
diluted, the material is no longer suitable for weapons and would
be sold as civilian reactor fuel with USEC the middleman.
</P>
<P>
   But the USEC's emergence as an investor-owned company competing
for profits on the uranium market suddenly changed the deal's
dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   ''The privatization left a crucial national security initiative
-- the purchase of 500 tons of uranium from Russia -- to the whim of
the private market,'' said Matthew Bunn, a nonproliferation expert
at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. ''It was one of
the most egregious national security blunders of the Clinton
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Neff of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who
conceived of the U.S.-Russia uranium deal and sold it to the
government, said the sale of USEC ''privatized national security.''
He predicted the government may eventually have to bail out both
USEC and the Russia deal.
</P>
<P>
   But the race to Wall Street in 1998 was moving so fast that on
the final day of the USEC board's deliberations on July 22, 1998,
''any questions raised that day were seen as obstacles,'' Burton
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Budget crunchers and former Wall Streeters then running the
Treasury Department saw the sale in terms of income for the
government, and Gore viewed it as a triumph for government
reinvention.
</P>
<P>
   ''Budget balancing was one of the factors. The second thing was
that USEC was pushing it,'' recalled Joseph Stiglitz, then chairman
of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers and one of the
few senior administration officials who strongly opposed the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could see very little benefit and very big risks,'' Stiglitz
said in an interview. As a private company, USEC ''would have every
incentive ... to bomb the (Russian) deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the national security folks at the White House, nor the
State Department shared Stiglitz' concern.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this (sale) had been done in the light of day, it never
would have happened,'' insisted Richard Miller, a lawyer for the
Paper Allied-Industrial Chemical and Energy Workers Union, which
represents USEC plant workers.

<HEADLINE> Change Said Needed in Labor Policy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE (AP) -- Singapore must change and become more flexible
toward labor policy, the city-state's deputy prime minister said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not just government policies which must change, but also
private sector companies and industries which must keep up as their
business moves, again and again,'' Lee Hsien Loong told delegates
at a trade union conference.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said preserving jobs was not always possible, and retrenched
workers needed to be retrained and employed in new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot afford to keep uncompetitive industries alive,
whether through government subsidies or by protecting our market,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee stressed the government's position on foreign talent, and
said that in order for the economy to thrive, Singapore needed to
continue bringing in overseas workers, despite opposition at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the reality. Our total work force is just over 2
million. Of these, Singaporeans account for 1.4 million, and
foreigners about 600,000,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we had sent home the 600,000 foreign workers during the
(Asian financial) crisis, far from the economy recovering and
creating new jobs, it would have nosedived.''

<HEADLINE> Crusading Nader: Third party candidate speaks at SyracuseUniversity  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Consumer crusader and Green Party
presidential candidate Ralph Nader preached his message of
returning power to the people at Syracuse University.
</P>
<P>
   The political mantra should be ''it's the citizens that matter.
It's the citizens who matter most,'' said the man behind Consumer
Reports and four decades of activism.
</P>
<P>
   Nader charged that his better-known opponents, Al Gore and
George W. Bush, are desperately trying to exclude third party
candidates, and issues that are important to voters, from the race.
</P>
<P>
   The longtime consumer activist told a Syracuse University
audience on Tuesday that the Democratic and Republican
front-runners do not have ''grassroots support'' and are in the
race exclusively because of the money behind their candidacies.
</P>
<P>
   Nader also reacted to a Zogby poll showing a majority of voters
want a third party to participate in debates. He said the new poll
shows that Americans crave the discussion of more issues than Bush
and Gore have selected to dominate the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''Politics should be about power -- who has it and who doesn't,''
Nader said, not the issues that Gore and Bush ''self-selected.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues Nader feels the leading candidates are ignoring
is the taxing of businesses.
</P>
<P>
   If corporations were taxed properly, he said, another $200
billion would be in the public's hands.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that Bill Gates, of Microsoft, has wealth equal
to 120 million people at the bottom of the economic scale.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to end corporate greed, and corporate fraud,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Despite continued reports of prosperity in America, Nader said,
libraries throughout the nation are closing.
</P>
<P>
   As debate season nears, the new poll by Zogby International
indicates that Nader could play an important role.
</P>
<P>
   The survey shows that a majority of respondents wants to allow
potential third party candidates to participate in televised
presidential debates with Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In the survey, 54.9 percent said Pat Buchanan should be allowed
to take part if he is the Reform Party candidate, and even if he
doesn't meet the 15 percent poll support level. In contrast, 41.5
percent disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   The responses were similar for Nader, with 51.3 percent
supporting his being a part of the debates if he is the Green Party
candidate while 44.2 percent disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   In the survey, Bush led Gore 45.8 percent to 42.2 percent
overall in the national head-to-head matchup, with 12 percent
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   With Buchanan as the Reform Party candidate, Bush led Gore 43.6
percent to 41.1 percent, followed by Buchanan at 5.2 percent with
10.1 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   With Buchanan as the Reform Party candidate and Nader as the
Green Party candidate, Bush continued to lead Gore 42.9 percent to
38.5 percent, followed by Nader at 5.7 percent and Buchanan 3.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, of 842 likely voters, was conducted April 1-4 and
has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Nader has been involved in consumer issues for nearly four
decades. His book ''Unsafe at Any Speed'' in 1965, which focused on
the safety shortcomings of the rear-engine Chevrolet Corvair,
exposed practices of the automobile industry and led to the passage
of new motor vehicle safety laws in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   He is the force behind the groups Public Citizen and the
Consumer's Union, which publishes Consumers Report magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Nader also ran for president on the Green Party line in 1992 and
1996. In announcing his third candidacy, Nader said the United
States faces serious societal problems in health care, education,
labor, energy, and the environment.

<HEADLINE> Runnoff in Texas Election  </HEADLINE>
By MARK BABINECK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- A retired military attorney won the Democratic
nomination Tuesday to run against Republican incumbent Sen. Kay
Bailey Hutchison in November, while a longtime state lawmaker won
the Republican nomination for retiring GOP Rep. Bill Archer's seat.
</P>
<P>
   The two races were among four runoffs held in Texas for Senate
and House nominations.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate contest, South Texan Gene Kelly, who lost six
previous statewide races, defeated former one-term state
representative Charles Gandy. They had emerged from a field of five
Democrats in the March 14 primary.
</P>
<P>
   With 97 percent of Texas precincts reporting, Kelly had 142,747
votes, or 59 percent, to 101,215, or 41 percent, for Gandy.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison, whose campaign has more than $6 million in the bank,
will be the heavy favorite in November.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen-year state Rep. John Culberson defeated businessman
Peter Wareing in a bitterly fought runoff for Archer's seat.
</P>
<P>
   With 98 percent of precincts reporting, Culberson had 29,285
votes, or 60 percent, while Wareing had 19,733 votes, or 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wareing accused Culberson of being a career politician and an
ineffective leader. Culberson branded Wareing a disloyal Republican
for voting in six Democratic primaries and donating to Democrats as
recently as 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Jeff Sells is expected to provide only token opposition
in the predominantly Republican district in November.
</P>
<P>
   Also, retired Temple oilman Ramsey Farley defeated Belton
contractor Rodney Geer in a Central Texas GOP runoff to challenge
Democratic Rep. Chet Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Bryndan Wright, a former aide to House Majority Leader Dick
Armey, defeated retired lawyer Bill Payne for the right to oppose
Rep. Martin Frost, the third-ranking Democrat in the House.

<HEADLINE> Elian To Meet Father Wednesday  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives will bring
the 6-year-old boy to Washington Wednesday for a meeting with his
father, a Cuban exile group said.
</P>
<P>
   A government official said shortly before midnight Tuesday that
the Justice Department was still trying to confirm that such a
meeting would take place. An attorney for the boy's father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, also would not comment on reports of a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Mas Santos, chairman of the Cuban American National
Foundation, told reporters Tuesday night that Elian's great-uncle
Lazaro Gonzalez would bring the boy to Washington for the
long-awaited reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Mas said the meeting would be closed to all non-family members
except Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder and Sen. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J. He said the meeting would occur at noon EDT at a
place yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
   ''After four and a half months, the private meeting that this
family has so yearned for with Juan Miguel Gonzalez tomorrow will
be a reality,'' Mas said. He said the family and the Justice
Department had both agreed to the details.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be at a neutral site, and there's basically
going to be a resolution of the situation,'' Jose Cardenas,
Washington director the Cuban exile group, told The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was announced at a Capitol Hill news conference.
Torricelli did not attend the news conference, but his spokesman,
Richard McGrath, confirmed that the senator was involved in the
negotiations to bring the boy to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''Senator Torricelli, Eric Holder and Greg Craig (the father's
attorney) worked out the arrangments,'' according to a source close
to the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath said Torricelli has been actively engaged in the issue,
but wouldn't confirm that a meeting had been arranged for
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The senator has been working for a period of time to keep
discussions going between the family and the Justice Department,''
McGrath said.
</P>
<P>
   The government had planned to send the Miami relatives a letter
outlining how and when they are to hand him over, but late Tuesday
a Justice Department official said the letter would not be sent.
Attorney General Janet Reno also postponed a planned trip to Miami
on Wednesday for discussions with community leaders and the Miami
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Further confusing the situation, Lazaro Gonzalez, the
great-uncle who has been caring for Elian since he was rescued,
emerged from the house in Miami shortly after midnight and declared
that the meeting was off.
</P>
<P>
   He said Elian did not want to go to Washington, so no one from
the Miami family would go. The crowd erupted with cheers.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a government official said Tuesday night that a
Justice Department letter to the Miami relatives has been drafted
and proposes that they transfer Elian at Opa Locka airport, near
Miami, on Thursday. That letter has not been sent and is on hold,
pending developments in Washington on Wednesday, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear late Tuesday to whom Elian would be transferred
Thursday under the government plan, but it would be either to Juan
Miguel if he goes to Opa Locka, or to another of Elian's
great-uncles, Manolo Gonzalez. The great-uncle would then fly with
the boy to another location to meet the father.
</P>
<P>
   If these sketchy reports about what might happen in Washington
Wednesday fall through, the government would then go ahead and send
the letter. It was because of the reports of a meeting that Reno
postponed her plan to go to Miami on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A source familiar with the ongoing discussions said it was
possible that the Miami relatives would travel to Washington with
Elian on Wednesday to meet with the father. This source said that
Juan Miguel's attorney, Greg Craig, had said that the father was
willing to meet with the Miami family but only if the boy was
transferred to him before that.
</P>
<P>
   Craig meet for two hours Tuesday afternoon with Reno and Holder,
and met the father Tuesday night at the home of Cuban diplomat
outside Washington. Craig left the house near midnight and refused
to answer questions shouted at him about the reported meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The source familiar with the discussions said that the plan was
for the Miami relatives to meet at noon in Washington with Juan
Miguel with no lawyers or government officials in the room, but the
source said Holder and Torricelli were supposed to be on hand in
the same building.
</P>
<P>
   This source noted that when the plan was announced Tuesday
evening, there was no mention of transferring Elian to Juan Miguel.
The source was unable to say whether this was because no transfer
was planned or because the Miami relatives and their allies did not
want to announce a transfer agreement until after they left Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, the Miami relatives asked to talk to the
father, but said they would only do so in Florida and added that
they would not relinquish the boy at such a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's possible return to her hometown -- where Cuban protesters
have displayed signs depicting her with horns and blaming her for
the Waco confrontation -- would come at a crucial time in the Elian
case.
</P>
<P>
   His Miami relatives have resisted her goal of reuniting the
6-year-old boy with his father this week, balking at handover plans
and continuing to press their court appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Arrangements were for the custody transfer were still being
worked out, said the official, who added that any meetings
involving Reno wouldn't alter the timetable being worked out for
Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
   Miami Mayor Joe Carollo, who discussed the situation with the
attorney general in Washington on Tuesday, said Reno was ''very
willing to meet Lazaro and any member of the Gonzalez family and
wants to meet with community leaders in Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials had said they would send the Miami relatives a
letter Tuesday with instructions for the custody transfer.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether the great-uncle would follow the
instructions, family spokesman Armando Gutierrez responded, ''All I
can tell you is that Lazaro will not break the law.''
</P>
<P>
   At Lazaro Gonzalez's house in Little Havana, where Elian has
been staying since he was rescued at sea while clinging to an inner
tube on Thanksgiving, five of his Miami schoolmates and his
principal stopped by to bring him a big card that read, ''Elian we
miss you.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been kept out of school recently because relatives
said they feared he would be taken away. The boy smiled and waved
goodbye to his classmates, then did a pull-up on the fence in front
the house and monkeyed around for TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   When the Miami relatives offered to meet with Elian's father,
they said they would bring the boy along if they were assured Elian
would not be taken during the reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Such meetings are essential and long overdue,'' Lazaro wrote
in a letter to a government-appointed psychiatrist. ''While we
cannot guarantee the ultimate outcome of discussions among the
family members, they might well help matters a great deal and could
not possibly make things any worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, a representative of the National
Council of Churches who met with the father Tuesday, said Juan
Miguel Gonzalez told her he would go to Florida if necessary to
reclaim his son.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'll do whatever he has to do short of meeting with
relatives,'' she said. ''He does not wish to meet with the
relatives until he has Elian in his arms.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the House Republican leadership and two
Cuban-American members of Miami's congressional delegation invited
Gonzalez, his wife and their infant son to a private meeting
Wednesday in the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want you to have the freedom to express your true feelings
during your visit without coercion and without intimidation,'' the
six lawmakers wrote. ''We want to be sure that you are aware of all
the options available to you as you make your decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives, pursuing another legal front, filed a brief
in Family Court on Tuesday, asking for a full hearing to bar
Elian's return to Cuba until his father's fitness is considered.
</P>
<P>
   The brief said Juan Miguel Gonzalez ''has engaged in abusive
conduct'' -- allegations the attorneys said the federal courts never
considered. It also said Elian would be subject to ''imminent
indoctrination'' in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The father's attorneys have characterized abuse allegations as
desperate tactics. The U.S. government asked the court to dismiss
the request, saying a state judge cannot overrule federal
immigration law.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, an overflow crowd of about 2,000 gathered at The
Shrine of Our Lady of Charity on the edge of Biscayne Bay to sing
and pray for Elian's mother and the 10 other Cubans who died when
their boat sank in the Florida Straits. Each victim's name was
read.

Elian To Meet Has Dad in Washington
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives will bring the 6-year-old
boy to Washington Wednesday for a meeting with his father, a Cuban exile group
and Sen. Robert Torricelli's office said. Jorge Mas Santos, chairman of the
Cuban American National Foundation, told reporters Tuesday night that Elian's
great-uncle Lazaro Gonzales would bring the boy to Washington for the meeting.
There was no immediate confirmation from either the Justice Department or from
the father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who is staying at Cuban diplomat's home
outside Washington.

Group Targets Heartburn Medication
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A consumer advocacy group urged the government Tuesday to
move faster to stop sales of Propulsid, a popular heartburn drug scheduled to be
pulled off the market this summer because it may cause deadly irregular
heartbeats. The Food and Drug Administration last month announced that Propulsid
was too dangerous for continued routine prescription, and worked with
manufacturer Janssen Pharmaceutica to create an unusual program allowing
Propulsid to be taken only by a limited number of patients with serious
illnesses. Under the plan, Janssen will quit marketing Propulsid on July 14 and
remove it from pharmacies in mid-August.

   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- Police on Tuesday put up rewards of about $1,300 for
information leading to the arrest of any of six cult leaders whose followers
were killed across southwest Uganda. Police have been searching for the leaders
since a fire in a cult chapel in the village of Kanungu on March 17 killed 530

nearby villages, turning up 394 more corpses. Many of those victims had been

Russia May Ratify Start II Treaty

<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian lawmakers agreed Tuesday to debate the long-delayed
START II arms treaty this week, following a ratification push from President
Vladimir Putin who is aiming for a landmark foreign policy move just weeks after
being elected. Lawmakers across the political spectrum predicted swift
ratification of the treaty that would halve the U.S. and Russian nuclear
arsenals to 3,000-3,500 warheads each. The debate is set for Friday. The treaty
was ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1996, but was repeatedly blocked by
Communists and hard-liners who dominated the State Duma, parliament's lower
house.

Bush Unveils $42B Plan for Poor

   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Continuing his outreach to independent and moderate
Democratic voters, Republican George W. Bush on Tuesday rolled out a five-year,
$42 billion plan to help the working poor move up into the middle class. The
biggest share of money, $35 billion, would be used for tax credits to help
people who don't get health insurance from their employers but earn too much to
qualify for government programs like Medicaid. They could use the credits to
gain access to basic private health care plans. An additional $5 billion would
be used to provide health care through medical savings accounts.

<HEADLINE> 2 men joined by affair with 'Sins of the Flesh' star face trialtogether  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- One defendant is the former chief executive
officer at a prestigious Wall Street firm, the other a businessman
and novice gambler. Their common romantic interest -- an X-rated
movie star -- has united them in an insider trading trial.
</P>
<P>
   Through their lawyers, James McDermott Jr. and Anthony Pomponio
have admitted to a relationship with Kathryn Gannon, a Canadian
woman who the jury is getting to know by order of Judge Kimba Wood
only as a ''model, dancer and actress who appeared in films under
the screen name Marylin Star.''
</P>
<P>
   McDermott, the former chief executive officer at Keefe, Bruyette
&AMP; Woods, and Pomponio, a New Jersey man who built his own quartz
and glass cutting company, knew Gannon as the star of such movies
as ''Sins of the Flesh,'' ''The Passion Potion'' and ''The
Violation of Marylin Star.''
</P>
<P>
   But the men say they did not know about each other until shortly
before their arrests. Throughout pretrial hearings and the start of
the trial, they have remained largely separate in court, bonded
only by their extramarital affairs with Gannon.
</P>
<P>
   Their fates rest in part on the jury's perception of their
relationships with Gannon, who remains in her Canadian home out of
the reach -- so far -- of U.S. efforts to extradite her.
</P>
<P>
   A jury in U.S. District Court in Manhattan began hearing and
seeing evidence in the case on Monday, including a simple headshot
of Gannon, described by a prosecutor as a ''28-year-old blonde, an
attractive woman.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial was to continue today.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors have listened to witnesses from a brokerage where
Gannon opened her first account after meeting McDermott and from
representatives of McDermott's company. The witnesses are giving
the jury a crash course on how information about stocks reaches the
public and how Gannon and Pomponio traded in stocks that
prosecutors allege earned them $170,000 in illegal profits.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say McDermott, 48, of Briarcliff Manor, enamored
with Gannon, fed her secret information about pending mergers and
acquisitions of six regional banks and a credit card company,
allowing her to profit illegally. She then allegedly gave the
information to Pomponio.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott's lawyer, Scott Muller, has encouraged jurors to
believe that McDermott and Gannon were so close that he easily
could have recommended the stocks to her before they went on a
secret list at his company prior to major public announcements
about them.
</P>
<P>
   Muller said McDermott and Gannon spoke to each other several
times a day from 1996 through 1999, when the couple allegedly
committed conspiracy and securities fraud, along with Pomponio.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's thousands, literally, of opportunities, face to face
and on the phone ... for them to have discussed it legitimately,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said there was no reason for McDermott, an executive earning
nearly $4 million annually, to risk his flourishing career by
giving stock secrets illegally to Gannon when he could afford to
just send her checks, which he did in amounts that nearly added up
to $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Pomponio's lawyer, Thomas Dunn, told the jury that his
45-year-old client did nothing wrong except engage in an
extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   When the Securities and Exchange Commission interviewed him,
Pomponio confessed everything about the relationship, including how
he met Gannon in an Atlantic City casino when she was at a trade
show.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had gotten involved with this good-looking woman and now
he's realizing that it was an immoral thing and how it's going to
impact on his family,'' Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   He said his client also had been successful, leaving high school
early to build a company, North Jersey Diamond Wheel, which makes
diamond wheels that cut the ''hardest material in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn said his client also is a chief executive officer, living
in North Caldwell, N.J., with his wife and a young daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a sense, his business success is that of the American
dream,'' Dunn said.

<HEADLINE> Indians 5, Athletics 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Charles Nagy allowed four hits in eight
innings and David Justice homered as the Cleveland Indians defeated
the Oakland Athletics 5-1 on Tuesday night for their fifth straight
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Nagy (1-1) struck out eight and did not allow an Oakland
baserunner past second with the exception of Jason Giambi's fourth
homer. Nagy improved to 12-5 lifetime against the A's, who lost for
the fourth time in five games.
</P>
<P>
   Justice hit his third home run of the season against Omar
Olivares (1-1) on the first pitch of the third inning to give the
Indians a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Alomar singled to lead off the fourth, and eventually
scored on a double play. He added a sacrifice fly in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Fryman walked to open the fifth and advanced to second on
Sandy Alomar's single. Kenny Lofton hit into a fielder's choice,
sending Fryman to third. Fryman scored when Olivares' pickoff throw
to first sailed into the Indians' bullpen. Lofton scored on the
sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Fryman added an RBI single in the sixth. Olivares allowed five
runs -- four earned -- and six hits in 5 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: A's 2B Randy Velarde is expected to visit the A's minor
league facilities in Arizona for further treatment while the A's
travel to cold-weather cities Boston and Cleveland. Velarde,
recovering from a strained left knee, could begin a rehab
assignment as early as next week. ... The Indians have said Paul
Shuey and Steve Karsay will be co-closers, at least for the time
being. Karsay, though, has both Cleveland saves thus far, and has
finished four games. Shuey has finished two, including Tuesday's.
... Roberto Alomar has a career mark of .474 (9-for-19) against
Olivares. ... A's DH John Jaha, who struck out three times against
Nagy, had a .478 career mark vs. the Indians' pitcher entering the
game. Lofton went hitless for the first time this season. ... The
Indians have committed one error in their first eight games.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Semitic violence down nationally, up in New York, California  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Although figures showed that anti-Semitic
violence in the United States hit its lowest level last year since
1989, three major incidents that left 11 people shot indicate the
problem isn't dissipating, according to the Anti-Defamation League.
</P>
<P>
   ''The horrific acts of violence and extremism we have witnessed
in the last year overwhelm the statistics,'' ADL National Director
Abraham Foxman said Tuesday, when his group released its annual
report on anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   The report also found that while such violence had decreased
nationally, there were increases in both California and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Foxman said the national decline was mitigated by several
horrific incidents, including a pair in California: the firebombing
of three Sacramento synagogues, a shooting spree at a Jewish
community center in suburban Los Angeles, and the Chicago shooting
of six Orthodox Jews walking home from Sabbath services.
</P>
<P>
   Five people were wounded in the Los Angeles community center
attack.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, there were 1,547 acts of anti-Semitic
violence, harassment and hatred in 1999 -- down from 1,611 acts a
year earlier, a 4 percent decline. Overall, anti-Semitic acts were
down 25 percent over the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   The report cited 868 acts of harassment, including verbal
intimidation, threats and physical assaults, and 679 acts of
vandalism, including property damage, arson and cemetery
desecrations.
</P>
<P>
   California saw an increase of 52 incidents last year, caused in
part by the June 17-18 synagogue arsons and the Aug. 10 community
center shooting. Both attacks prompted ''copycat'' incidents, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, there were 275 acts of anti-Semitism in California, up
from 1998's 223 -- a jump of 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the number of anti-Semitic acts was up 9 percent
last year, from 324 in 1998 to 352 in 1999. The increase took place
outside New York City, where the reported incidents were down six
percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts reported a slight uptick in incidents, from 107 to
111. New Jersey and Florida, while both in the top five states in
number of incidents, experienced declines from 1998, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics for 1999 were compiled from the ADL's 30 offices
and from law enforcement. The ADL, founded in 1913, issued its
first report in 1979.

<HEADLINE> Federal Delays Slowing Farm Program  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN SEEWER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) -- A delay in federal funding is keeping
farmers from participating in a program designed to block
pesticides from seeping into waterways and prevent soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
   The state is waiting for the U.S. Agriculture Department's share
of money so it can begin reimbursing farmers who plant trees or
strips of grass near streams. The ''buffer strips'' would help keep
chemicals from reaching northern Ohio's lakes and rivers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're all ready to get this going,'' Larry Vance, chief of the
state's division of soil and water conservation, said Tuesday.
''It's disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program is slated to commit
$201 million over the next 15 years in Ohio. The federal
government's share would be about $11.1 million each year. The
state's share would be $33.5 million over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   State officials say it's crucial that this year's money be
available within the next few weeks so that farmers can plant the
trees and grass before summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to get those in before it gets too warm and too dry,''
Vance said. ''I don't think they understand that a lost week
converts into a lost year for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio's program is part of a national plan to have 2 million
miles of buffers by 2002. While other states have received federal
money this year, Agriculture Department officials say they are
still working on details for the Ohio payments.
</P>
<P>
   Vance said he has been told that the money has been approved,
but that federal officials are waiting to make an official
announcement, which could come within a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, farmers are getting frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were told the funds were going to be there and they're
not,'' said Jared McClarren, a Fulton County farmer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are approaching the end of when we should be planting
trees,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The state has 20,000 trees ready for planting that are sitting
in coolers, Vance said.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio lawmakers have committed the $33.5 million to their 10-year
program that will pay farmers in 27 northern Ohio counties to use
strips of their land for the buffer zones instead of farming. The
state hopes to establish 100,000 acres of conservation buffers in
the Lake Erie region.
</P>
<P>
   Besides reducing pesticide and fertilizer runoff,
environmentalists say the program will improve Lake Erie's water
quality and restore wildlife habitats.
</P>
<P>
   It's a voluntary program, and farmers must use cropland or
pastureland to qualify. It will cover counties in the Maumee,
Portage, Sandusky, Huron, Vermilion and Black River watersheds.
</P>

   LAPORTE, Ind. (AP) -- Last week's cold snap killed off most of
this year's apple crop in northern Indiana, where unseasonably mild
readings had lured flower-laden buds into early development.
</P>
<P>
   Apple growers and agriculture specialists said readings that
dropped into the lower 20s last Wednesday froze much of the
sensitive apple buds -- from those in large orchards to the backyard
apple trees.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the worst I've ever seen,'' said Mike Garwood of Garwood
Orchards, west of LaPorte.
</P>
<P>
   Garwood's family has been selling apples from their 200-acre
farm in rural LaPorte County since the 1930s. The orchard has
40,000 apple trees.
</P>
<P>
   But from cuttings he has made of his trees, Garwood estimates
that three-fourths of the buds will not bear fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Each fall, some 30,000 school children take field trips to
County Line Orchards in Lake County, either on pumpkin-gathering or
apple-picking adventures. This year, it looks like they'll be
plenty of pumpkins and few apples.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I'll have to put it out in our newsletter that there
were no blossoms,'' said David McAfee, who operates the orchard
with his wife, Bonnie. ''We may have to put in more pumpkins.''
</P>
<P>
   He estimates his loss between 70 and 100 percent, but hopes
there will be at least a partial bearing of fruit.
</P>
<P>
   McAfee blames the apple loss on the Pacific Ocean's La Nina
phenomenon, which has brought an unseasonably mild winter to most
of the Eastern United States. The recent cold weather has been
short-lived, but it left its mark.
</P>
<P>
   ''The orchards are wiped out,'' said Porter County Purdue
agriculture educator David Yeager.
</P>
<P>
   He said the long warm spell caused the tree's bud bearing stems
to grow out instead of closer to the woody portion, where they are
usually protected from the cold at this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   Another spell of cold weather this weekend zapped the trees
again, along with sensitive trees and plants across a large portion
of Indiana. But northern Indiana's apple crop appears to have been
hardest hit.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is part of the business,'' said Bonnie McAfee. ''The worst
part is people will get mad when you tell them they can't have any
apples.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeager said homeowners with apple trees can easily test to see
if they will have apples. They can take a sharp knife or razor
blade and slice in half the ''king'' bud -- the big bud in the
cluster of four other little buds.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there is a brown spot in the middle, it's dead,'' Yeager
said.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Albanians Slowly Rebuilding  </HEADLINE>
By ALISON MUTLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELA CRKVA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Bejtush Popaj and his family fled
the country on foot when Serb forces began killing ethnic Albanians
in his village last year. Serbs then burned and plundered his home.
Now, after a winter of hardship, it's time to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   Popaj was one of the hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanian
refugees who returned home last year after the 78-day NATO air
bombardment of Yugoslavia ended in June, driving out forces loyal
to President Slobodan Milosevic from the province.
</P>
<P>
   But home was nothing like he left it.
</P>
<P>
   The six-room, two-storied house where he, his wife, and his five
daughters had lived in this village, not far from the snowcapped
mountains of neighboring Albania, was a charred shell.
</P>
<P>
   ''They destroyed 40 years of my life in half an hour,'' said
Popaj, a 47-year-old English teacher who lost 28 relatives from his
village 50 miles southwest of Pristina in wartime atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   They were among 67 Bela Crkva residents shot or hacked to death
by Serb military forces. Most of them were killed March 25, 1999,
just hours before the first NATO bombings, the youngest only 2
years old. They are buried in the ''Martyrs' Cemetery'' on a nearby
hill.
</P>
<P>
   Popaj does not gladly talk about those horrors. Instead, he
concentrates on rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   The Popaj family is confined to living in two rooms whose only
furniture is a couple of thin mattresses. A new roof and a new rear
wall have been built, but most of the house is strewn with rubble
and blackened from fire. Huge sacks of U.S flour rations are stored
in the house and new window frames lie in the tent he and his
family lived in until January.
</P>
<P>
   Still Popaj's home is in better shape than many others. Kosovo
10 months after the withdrawal of Milosevic's forces still shows
the scars of nearly a year of fighting that provoked NATO
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Village after village displays rows of burned out and destroyed
houses. The hulks of charred cars destroyed in the fighting remain
on neglected streets, and skeletons of animals killed by the
fighting -- or through neglect --litter fields and rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Most homes were incinerated by Serbs seeking to drive ethnic
Albanians from the province and destroy their property. After
NATO's air campaign ended in June, revenge-seeking Albanians also
carried out reprisal attacks on Serb property.
</P>
<P>
   International efforts in the wake of the violence were less
focused on rebuilding and more on survival -- the idea was to ensure
that the tens of thousands of returning residents had a least one
warm room to spend the winter in.
</P>
<P>
   But with the onset of spring, the focus has turned to wholesale
reconstruction. In Bela Crkva and elsewhere, piles of ruddy-orange
bricks, roof tiles wrapped in plastic, and mountains of timber are
lined up in the streets next to the rubble of destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel safe here now,'' said Popaj, surrounded by his family
on a small plot of land next to the house. The village was shelled
by Serb forces in the summer of 1998 during a battle with the
Kosovo Liberation Army in the nearby town of Orahovac. Popaj
supported the KLA by giving fighters supplies and observing Serb
positions in the area.
</P>
<P>
   After the family returned, they dared not plant vegetables,
fearing the soil may have been mined.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as life slowly gets better, the family plans to sow water
melons.
</P>
<P>
   On the top floor of the house, there are loose electric wires
and rubble in one room. But there is also the smell of fresh timber
from doors and the roof rafters donated by humanitarian
organizations, and a new washing machine from his brother who lives
in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Popaj's daughters still wake up crying at night. But in Kosovo,
he says, the basics are what count.
</P>
<P>
   ''The good thing is that we are alive. It is hard to crush the
spirit.''

<HEADLINE> ABC OKs DiCaprio-Clinton Interview  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ABC is going ahead with a broadcast next week
that shows President Clinton being interviewed on global warming by
movie star Leonardo DiCaprio.
</P>
<P>
   The interview, which had angered some at ABC who wondered why an
actor was fulfilling a role usually handled by a journalist, was
screened by top ABC executives who said Tuesday that portions would
make it on the air.
</P>
<P>
   DiCaprio, chairman of the Earth Day 2000 celebration committee,
talked to Clinton at the White House on March 31. The interview
will appear as part of an Earth Day special produced by ABC News on
Saturday, April 22 at 8 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was an editorial judgment made here with many senior
management people involved,'' said ABC News spokeswoman Eileen
Murphy. ''Everyone is comfortable with the decision. But we're not
going to discuss our editorial process.''
</P>
<P>
   It's still not clear how much of the reported 20-minute chat
between the ''Titanic'' star and Clinton will make it on the air.
Murphy said the final product ''will meet with ABC News editorial
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In the end,'' she said, ''we'll be judged by what is on the
air.''
</P>
<P>
   Many journalists within ABC, particularly in the Washington
bureau, were upset when they heard DiCaprio was granted the
interview.
</P>
<P>
   There was some dispute last week between ABC, the White House
and DiCaprio's representatives over how it was set up. ABC News
President David Westin said DiCaprio was visiting at the White
House's request, with the understanding that the president might
appear on film walking through the White House with the actor.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said ABC had requested an interview and
DiCaprio's spokesman, Ken Sunshine, said the actor was prepared to
conduct one.
</P>
<P>
   Westin had told ABC News staffers in an e-mail that there was a
chance DiCaprio's White House footage would not be used at all. He
was not available to talk about Tuesday's decision to go ahead,
Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine said that ''we're delighted and always assumed that the
interview would be included.'' He said DiCaprio will be consulted
during the editing process of the special.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's perplexed that this became such a big deal,'' he said.
''All he ever wanted and wants is for lots of people to learn a lot
about global warming.''
</P>
<P>
   The special, with ''20/20'' correspondent Chris Cuomo as host,
includes segments on coral bleaching off the Florida coast, urban
sprawl in Atlanta and the effects of global warming on Alaskans.

<HEADLINE> ABC Wins Ratings Race, Again  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ''ER'' isn't vulnerable yet.
</P>
<P>
   Even though ABC has stretched its winning streak in television's
prime-time ratings to 15 weeks, the network's ''Wonderland'' and
CBS's ''Falcone'' both faltered last week against NBC's popular
medical show.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC and CBS dramas had a combined viewership of barely more
than half of the ''ER'' audience on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 27 million people who had been watching ABC's ''Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire'' on Thursday, an eye-popping 20 million
changed the channel rather than watch ''Wonderland,'' Nielsen Media
Research reported. ABC announced Tuesday that it was pulling future
episodes of ''Wonderland'' from the air.
</P>
<P>
   CBS is taking the unusual step of airing nine ''Falcone''
episodes over eight nights. The opening night's average audience of
10.4 million people was respectable, but succeeding nights couldn't
match that.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the NCAA basketball championship game between Michigan
State and Florida had the lowest ratings since CBS began
broadcasting the college basketball championship in 1982. It was 18
percent under the previous low set last year.
</P>
<P>
   CBS's airing of the live drama, ''Fail Safe,'' with George
Clooney on Sunday night drew slightly lower ratings than the
average CBS Sunday movie. CBS was pleased, however, that the Cold
War drama drew far more male viewers to the network than usually
watch its sentimental Sunday fare.
</P>
<P>
   For the week, ABC had a prime-time average of 13 million viewers
(8.9 rating, 15 share), followed by CBS's 11.7 million (8.2, 14).
NBC had 10.4 million viewers (7.5, 13) and Fox had 7.6 million
(5.1, 9).
</P>
<P>
   UPN had 3.3 million viewers and the WB had 3.1 million, although
both had identical 2.3 ratings and 4 shares. Pax TV had 1.2 million
viewers (0.9 rating, 2 share).
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ''Nightly News'' won the evening news race with 9.7
million viewers (7.2 rating, 16 share). ABC's ''World News
Tonight'' had 9.2 million viewers (7.1, 15) and the ''CBS Evening
News'' had 7.6 million viewers (5.9, 13).
</P>
<P>
   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
   For the week of April 3-9, the top 10 shows, their networks and
ratings were ''ER,'' NBC, 18.3; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
(Tuesday), ABC, 17.9; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Sunday),
ABC, 17.2; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Thursday), ABC, 17.2;
''NCAA Basketball Championship: Florida vs. Michigan St.'' CBS,
14.1; ''The Practice,'' ABC, 13.7; ''Law and Order,'' NBC, 12.6;
''60 Minutes,'' CBS, 12.5; ''Touched By an Angel,'' CBS, 12.1;
''Friends,'' NBC, 11.8.

<HEADLINE> Blood Pressure, Apnea Linked  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Sleep apnea, the breathing disorder that affects
some 12 million Americans, may raise the risk of high blood
pressure, researchers reported today in the Journal of the American
Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep apnea is characterized by brief pauses in breathing during
sleep and is usually accompanied by loud snoring. The disorder is
more common in people who are obese.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, researchers measured breathing pauses and blood
pressure in 6,132 men and women 40 and older.
</P>
<P>
   Those with moderate to severe apnea -- more than 30 breathing
pauses per hour -- were more than twice as likely to have high blood
pressure as those without apnea. The risk increased with the
severity of the apnea, regardless of weight, age or sex.
</P>
<P>
   More research is needed to confirm that apnea can cause high
blood pressure, but the link makes sense, said Dr. Javier Nieto, an
epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins University School Public Health
who led the study.
</P>
<P>
   Continuous breathing lapses could force the nervous system and
other bodily systems to work harder, ultimately creating high blood
pressure, Nieto said.
</P>
<P>
   Previous research also suggested such a link, but this study was
the largest to date, Nieto said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Claude Lenfant, director of the National Heart, Lung and
Blood Institute, which funded the study, called the findings
extremely important, since high blood pressure is a major risk
factor for heart disease, the nation's No. 1 cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Clifford Zwillich of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center
in Denver said that treating apnea would not necessarily be more
effective than using medication to lower blood pressure.

<HEADLINE> Docs Admit Falsifying Insurance Info  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Doctors have their own terms for it -- covert
advocacy, manipulating reimbursement rules, gaming. But to
insurance companies, misrepresenting patient information is plain,
old fraud.
</P>
<P>
   A new study suggests the practice is on the rise as doctors feel
more pressure to provide treatment not authorized under
managed-care plans.
</P>
<P>
   More than one out of every three doctors admitted they deceived
insurance companies to help patients get necessary care, according
to the national survey reported today in the Journal of the
American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Tactics included exaggerating the severity of an illness to help
patients avoid being sent home early from the hospital; listing an
inaccurate diagnosis on bills; and reporting nonexistent symptoms
to secure insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1998 mail survey of 720 doctors, 39 percent said they had
used at least one of those tactics ''sometimes'' or more often
within the preceding year.
</P>
<P>
   ''As pressures to control health care costs increase, it is
likely that manipulating reimbursement systems will increase,''
wrote the researchers, led by Dr. Matthew Wynia of the AMA's
Institute for Ethics in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Health plans in which the use of these tactics is common
should carefully review their rules and procedures and work with
physicians to reduce the perceived need for covert advocacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-seven percent said their patients ''sometimes'' or more
often asked them to deceive insurers. More than one-fourth -- 28.5
percent -- said it is necessary to ''game'' the system to provide
high-quality care.
</P>
<P>
   Of the doctors who reported using deceitful practices, 54
percent said they did so more often than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles Cutler, chief medical officer for the American
Association of Health Plans, which represents more than 1,000 HMOs
and other insurance plans, said doctors who deceive insurers are
''essentially allowing people to get benefits for which they
haven't paid.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The people who pay for that are everybody else who's paying
for the premiums,'' Cutler said. He said the practice will
ultimately backfire and cause costs to rise.
</P>
<P>
   A smaller survey published in the AMA's Archives of Internal
Medicine last year found that more than half of 169 doctors who
responded approved of the use of deceitful practices with insurance
companies. The authors of the latest survey said theirs is the
first to report what doctors are actually doing.
</P>
<P>
   Although doctors were not asked why they engaged in deception,
the researchers suggested such reasons as managed-care restrictions
and patients' demands.
</P>
<P>
   Cutler said having patients pay for uncovered procedures
out-of-pocket or appealing insurers' rejection of coverage are
legitimate alternatives to deception.
</P>
<P>
   An accompanying editorial said Wynia's study provides the most
reliable information to date on the extent of such deception and
calls the findings ''stunning.''
</P>
<P>
   The practice may result in part from the public's contradictory
expectations of medicine and insurance -- wanting costs contained
but demanding access to the finest health care and expecting
''their physicians to be faithful, uncompromising agents,'' wrote
Dr. M. Gregg Bloche of the Georgetown-Johns Hopkins University
Program in Law and Public Health.

<HEADLINE> Study Explores Estrogen Treatment  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A new study has found that estrogen supplements
can reduce cholesterol in certain cases, but it only adds to the
confusion over whether hormones after menopause help or hurt
women's hearts.
</P>
<P>
   The study, involving women who already had heart disease, found
that estrogen-progestin supplements reduced elevated levels of a
type of cholesterol that has been linked to heart disease. But in
women with low levels of the cholesterol to begin with, the
hormones seemed to raise the risk of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said they cannot explain the findings.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with last week's report from a government-funded study
of women and estrogen, the findings add to recent evidence that
hormone supplements might not be as good for the heart as some
earlier research suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of women take estrogen supplements to ease hot flashes
and other symptoms of menopause and to protect themselves against
osteoporosis. For the past two decades, doctors have also believed
that estrogen wards off heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the American Heart Association said the new
findings are too inconclusive to suggest women with heart disease
should start or discontinue the use of hormones.
</P>
<P>
   ''The take-home message remains the same -- hormone replacement
therapy is not for everybody and it really has to be decided on an
individual basis,'' said Dr. Elizabeth Ross, a Washington
cardiologist.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent findings, published in today's Journal of the
American Medical Association, are based on data from the Heart and
Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study, or HERS, which involved 2,763
postmenopausal women with heart disease. The study was conducted at
20 clinical centers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   HERS compared the effects of hormones vs. a placebo on women
followed from 1993 to 1998 and found hormones essentially had no
effect on warding off heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Shlipak of the University of California at San
Francisco and colleagues further examined the HERS data and the
effects of hormones on lipoprotein-a after a year of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Lipoprotein-a contains both LDL-cholesterol -- the ''bad'' type
linked to hardening of the arteries --and a protein that may promote
clotting.
</P>
<P>
   While the researchers found that hormone treatment can lower
lipoprotein-a levels -- which are difficult to treat -- they
acknowledged further study is needed to determine the extent of the
interaction.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's results from the government-funded Women's Health
Initiative showed that older women on estrogen had a slightly
higher risk of heart attack, stroke or a blood clot during their
first two years of treatment compared with women who took a
placebo.

<HEADLINE> Runoff Vote Sought in Peru Election  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori was hanging on the
edge of a questionable re-election victory while challenger
Alejandro Toledo demanded a second-round runoff to avoid social
upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   Chanting ''Down with the dictatorship,'' about 30,000 Peruvians
rallied Tuesday outside the downtown hotel where Toledo issued his
demand.
</P>
<P>
   ''Alejandro Toledo will not lead disturbances or violence,''
said the 54-year-old economist-turned-candidate. ''But I should say
forcefully that we won't hesitate for one second to defend
democracy and the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Clinton administration weighed in with a
strongly worded appeal for fairness, telling Fujimori that the
United States expects a runoff and would question the legitimacy of
a first-round win.
</P>
<P>
   Peruvian election authorities said final results from Sunday's
ballot would be released today.
</P>
<P>
   With 90.8 percent of the ballots counted, officials said Tuesday
that Fujimori had 49.96 percent of the vote and Toledo had 40.39
percent. Various other candidates split the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls and unofficial vote tallies by independent monitors
after the election had indicated Fujimori received significantly
less support and projected that he would not reach the 50 percent
plus one vote needed to avoid a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   If neither candidate wins a majority of valid votes, a runoff
would be held in late May or early June.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not accept the results if it does not go to a second
round, and if in this second round there aren't substantial changes
to the rules of the game,'' Toledo said while thousands of
supporters rallied outside.
</P>
<P>
   A gigantic red and white Peruvian flag was unfurled, blanketing
a mass of protesters, who passed it over their heads from one end
of the plaza to the other.
</P>
<P>
   ''The dictator will fall,'' they chanted, referring to
Fujimori's autocratic style of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred demonstrators, most of them students, broke from
the rally and marched nine blocks with the flag to the Presidential
Palace, chanting anti-Fujimori slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller demonstrations occurred throughout the day Tuesday in
cities across this Andean nation of 25 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori and his supporters had criticized Toledo for leading a
march to the palace that turned violent after the vote. But Toledo
said Tuesday that he had ''put the breaks on'' potentially
explosive protests in eight Peruvian cities.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to publicly ask Fujimori for a meeting with the
interests of the Peruvian people in mind, to find a solution to
avoid popular upheaval,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori made no public response.
</P>
<P>
   The 61-year-old president denied any fraud at a news conference
Monday, his only appearance since the election. ''The process has
been clean, free and fair,'' he said. ''There were small incidents
that did not affect the process.''
</P>
<P>
   But details of voting irregularities continued to surface
Tuesday. Toledo's camp said that names of other candidates were
waxed over on ballots, allowing only Fujimori's name to be marked.
</P>
<P>
   Under Peruvian law, ballots are destroyed once the results are
recorded, making it nearly impossible to prove such allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Peru's National Ombudsman Office, which had 1,316 poll monitors
at 875 voting centers, said there have been ''innumerable
accusations'' of irregularities, with the most general being the
distribution of copies of pre-marked ballots favoring Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   The Ombudsman Office also said that tests before the election of
the computer system used to tally votes detected ''demonstrable
errors.''
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Stein, head of a team of monitors from the Organization
of American States, complained that his mission was denied access
to inspect the computer system on election day.
</P>
<P>
   Stein demanded an explanation for a 12-hour delay in the
delivery of the first official results, and questioned how election
officials tallied more than half the vote Monday after their
computer centers had been closed all night.

<HEADLINE> Activist to push bill forcing Wallingford to observe King holiday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WALLINGFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The only Connecticut town that fails
to close its offices on Martin Luther King Day will get a visit
from the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson will stop here April 26 to support a bill before the
Legislature that would force the town to honor the state holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Appropriations Committee voted 39-6 in favor of
that bill.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, a national civil rights leader and King contemporary,
has also been invited to speak at the Capitol and to attend a
service honoring King at St. Paul's Episcopal Church.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Mayor William Dickinson has said the controversy is
not about race, but a dispute with the town's labor unions.
Dickinson wants town workers to swap another holiday for King Day,
but union leaders want workers to get the day off as an extra paid
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson and union leaders are currently negotiating. Dickinson
could not be reached for comment Tuesday. A message was left at his
office by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Jan. 17 holiday this year, three people wearing Ku
Klux Klan hoods and robes walked along Main Street. On the holiday,
one of those people stood near the church hosting a celebration
honoring King.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson wants to do his part to push for statewide observance,
said Roger Vann, president of the state chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   ''From early on, he expressed interest in coming. It was only a
question of when,'' said Vann.
</P>
<P>
   Vann said he and others had hoped Jackson would come on April 4,
the 32nd anniversary of King's assassination in Memphis, Tenn., and
the day of the Appropriations Committee vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''His schedule did not provide for that, but we definitely
wanted him to come here before the end of the session,'' said Vann.
</P>
<P>
   The bill must clear the General Law Committee before reaching
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Alfred Adinolfi, R-Cheshire, has said the bill is unfair
because it singles out Wallingford. Before its vote, the
Appropriations Committee killed Adinolfi's proposal to require all
towns to close their offices on the holiday. Sen. Brian McDermott,
D-Wallingford has said he will push for that provision when the
bill is debated in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   This will be Jackson's second visit to Wallingford. Dickinson
marched briefly with Jackson in August 1991 when Jackson came to
town to bring attention to social and economic problems in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ''He walked the town from the south end to the north end, and he
met a lot of people here, so I think he has a good impression of
Wallingford,'' said Rep. Mary Mushinsky, D-Wallingford, who
proposed the legislation.

<HEADLINE> Connecticut officials investigating death of inmate in Virginiaprison  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDDLETOWN, Conn. (AP) -- The state's corrections commissioner
says it was ''minutes'' before guards who witnessed a Connecticut
prisoner hanging himself entered his cell inside a Virginia prison.
</P>
<P>
   And that has some lawmakers questioning the safety of
Connecticut inmates who were transferred to Wallens Ridge State
Prison in Big Stone Gap, Va.
</P>
<P>
   David Tracy, 20, of Bridgeport, was found dead in his cell at
Wallens Ridge on April 5 with a bedsheet tied around his neck. A
guard reportedly saw him jump, fall or drop from the top bunk bed
in his cell.
</P>
<P>
   ''It did take some minutes to open the (cell) door. An officer
in a maximum security prison can't just open doors at whim,''
Department of Correction Commissioner John Armstrong said Tuesday.
''There are protocols and procedures that must be followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael Lawlor, co-chairman of the Legislature's Judiciary
Committee, said those procedures may have cost Tracy his life.
</P>
<P>
   ''It takes a long time to suffocate if you hang yourself,'' said
Rep. Michael Lawlor, D-East Haven, co-chairman of the Legislature's
Judiciary Committee. ''We need to know what happened between the
time of the fall and the time the guard entered the cell.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, Public Safety Commissioner Henry Lee and other state
officials returned from Wallens Ridge Monday after opening an
investigation into Tracy's death. Lee, a world-renown forensics
expert, observed the autopsy. He said Tracy died from a lack of
blood to the brain -- an injury consistent with a hanging suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said Tracy wrote what appeared to be a suicide note on his
hand. He would not disclose details of the message, or other notes
left in Tracy's cell. Tracy, was a gang member serving a 2 1/2-year
sentence for selling drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''What was written in several locations clearly supports the
initial indication of this man taking his own life,'' Armstrong
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy's body was expected to arrive at the Office of the State's
Chief Medical Examiner by Wednesday, where another autopsy may be
performed, Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we first learned of the incident it was followed by
concerns and allegations of foul play,'' Armstrong said. ''All
indications are David Tracy took his own life.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut officials say they will continue investigating the
incident, and will review the procedures at Wallens Ridge by
watching videotapes that recorded Tracy's death. Armstrong said the
state probe could take months.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to make sure that we are accurate and concise on the
findings,'' Armstrong said. ''If we have an issue that we want to
have further addressed, that will prolong the time frame.
</P>
<P>
   And Lawlor said that could include a federal probe.
</P>
<P>
   ''If their answers show some misconduct, or we're not satisfied
with some answers, we'll ask for a federal investigation,'' said
Lawlor, D-East Haven.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is already investigating allegations of abuse made by
New Mexico inmates who were shipped to Wallens Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   Since October, about 480 Connecticut inmates have been moved to
Wallens Ridge. Gov. John G. Rowland and Armstrong say the transfers
ease overcrowding in Connecticut prisons and break up gangs.
</P>
<P>
   But Tracy's death, along with last month's shooting of three
Connecticut inmates with rubber bullets have prompted lawmakers to
call for the inmates' return.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sounds as though there are enough problems occurring that
most people are agreeing hat Wallens Ridge is not the best place
after all,'' Lawlor said.

<HEADLINE> New Haven tries to rebuild sports offerings  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- The Elm City, which has lost several
sports franchises and major events in recent years, is hoping for
an athletic renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the United Hockey League is expected to announce it will
bring a new team, the New Haven Blades, to the Coliseum this
winter.
</P>
<P>
   The news comes a year after the demise of the Beast of New
Haven, which ended play in the American Hockey League after when it
could not line up a major-league affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   New management at the Coliseum also is trying to lure the
Connecticut Pride, a Continental Basketball League basketball team,
from Hartford, and possibly an arena football team.
</P>
<P>
   The Pilot Pen Tennis Tournament has announced several marquee
names including Venus Williams and Monica Seles will play in New
Haven this year, two years after the city lost the men's event.
</P>
<P>
   The city's Double-A baseball team, the New Haven Ravens, is
giving the city another chance after threatening to leave because
of problems with their ballpark, 73-year-old Yale Field in
neighboring West Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the team drew a franchise-low 197,153 fans to 68
home games -- the second-worst attendance in the Eastern League.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens have long sought a downtown New Haven stadium. The
team talked last year with Springfield, Mass., about moving to a
new stadium there, but the plan was dropped amid court battles and
opposition from the Ravens' fellow Eastern League team, the New
Britain Rock Cats.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're committed to play at Yale Field and do the best we can
here. We've done a lot of things to improve the fan experience,''
said Bill Berger, assistant general manager of the Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   Attractions include a ''Best Seat in the House'' promotion that
allows fans to sit in leather chairs, and the ability to rent a hot
tub to be placed later this spring in right field.
</P>
<P>
   Hungry fans who do not want to wait in line for hot dogs and
other snacks can order concessions online before the game, and can
even specify what time they'd like the food.
</P>
<P>
   The concessions are picked up at a special window. Waiters
deliver online-ordered concessions to season ticketholders.
</P>
<P>
   Fans seem to be taking a wait-and-see approach to the new
efforts to attract them.
</P>
<P>
   ''New Haven can't seem to sustain a team here. I don't know what
the problem is. I guess attendance is a problem,'' said Jim Lucas,
a city resident who was enjoying a lunchtime beer at Playoffs, a
sports bar.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas said he hoped the new sports teams could make a go of it.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of times, when you fail, you learn from those
failures,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The city's geography can sometimes work against it. New Haven
residents are mostly fans of New York City sports teams, and the
city is close enough for area residents to make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Many tennis fans attend the Pilot Pen as a warm-up to the U.S.
Open, which starts a week later in New York.
</P>
<P>
   A Connecticut-New York rivalry is the planned for the New Haven
Blades. The UHL already has four teams in New York, including a
team in Elmira that will also begin play this year.
</P>
<P>
   Quality of play is one step below the level of the Beast, and is
equivalent in the sports hierarchy to the Ravens' Double-A level to
Major League Baseball.

<HEADLINE> State trains officials in mosquito battle plan  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHELTON, Conn. (AP) -- Municipal officials spent a day at boot
camp, where they were given tips on how to fight the enemy:
mosquitoes that carry strains of encephalitis.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 local health directors, emergency management
coordinators, conservation directors and public works personnel on
Tuesday were asked to eliminate mosquito breeding grounds and
aggressively report animal deaths so the bodies can be tested for
infection.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, representing more than 60 cities and towns, were
told at a state-sponsored workshop that there is no way to predict
whether the West Nile-like strain of the virus will reemerge this
summer. Last year, seven people in New York died, dozens more were
sickened and more than 3,000 birds turned up dead in New York, New
Jersey and Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   No human cases of the mosquito-borne viral infection were
reported in either Connecticut or New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut is doubling the number of mosquito trapping sites
and spending $500,000 on larvicide. But municipalities also have a
role.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Andreadis, chief medical entomologist for the
Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, said the state will
begin trapping and testing mosquitoes for the virus in June, adding
36 new locations to the 37 existing trap sites.
</P>
<P>
   The new sites will be located in Fairfield and New Haven
counties, where mosquitoes and dead crows infected with the virus
were found last year.
</P>
<P>
   The state will also hand out $500,000 for larviciding in 45
communities where the West Nile or eastern equine (EEE) strains of
encephalitis are likely to reemerge. While the West Nile virus was
found mainly in southwestern Connecticut last year, the discovery
of EEE created a scare in southeastern Connecticut in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're still not going to be able to get every one, but let's
kill the mosquitoes that could become adults,'' said Paul
Capotosto, mosquito management supervisor for the Department of
Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials were also asked to educate the public about the
need to clean out gutters, catchbasins, swimming pool covers and
anything else that holds standing water where mosquitoes breed.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Harrison, legislative liaison for Bridgeport, said the city
is in the process of cleaning out its 9,600 catchbasins. Last fall,
a caged crane at the Beardsley Zoo died from the West Nile strain.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last year, we had people calling on a daily basis saying, 'I
have a dead bird in my yard,''' she said. ''I don't think the
public is scared at this point ... but it's important to prepare.''
</P>
<P>
   In Greenwich, where mosquitoes trapped at the Innis Arden Golf
Club tested positive for West Nile last September, officials are
sending every home and business in town copies of a brochure
outlining the town's mosquito management program and protective
steps people can take.
</P>
<P>
   ''Education is one of the most important pieces of combating
this virus, whether it's the state government, the municipality or
the residents,'' said Caroline Baisley, the town's health director.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-Cuban Ties May Go Under Review  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The heart-wrenching drama of Elian Gonzalez
has drawn fresh attention to the influence wielded by
Cuban-Americans in America's political system, clout that in the
past has far outweighed their numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the 6-year-old boat wreck survivor already has
figured in the 2000 presidential campaign and continues to echo in
the halls of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Still, anti-Castro activists and their allies in Congress, who
for years have kept the U.S. economic embargo of Cuba in place, are
having a hard time lining up followers this time.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's because public opinion polls show most Americans
believe Elian should be reunited with his Cuban father. Or that
images show a fervor on the streets of Miami's Little Havana that
many Americans have a hard time fathoming.
</P>
<P>
   A bill to grant Elian American citizenship, a rallying point for
the Cuban-American lobby, has been quietly shunted aside in both
the House and the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Another bill, to grant Elian and his Cuban family permanent
residency status, also appears to be going nowhere, despite a
flurry of attention after Vice President Al Gore suddenly -- and
surprisingly to many fellow Democrats -- endorsed it late last
month.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see very little support for this outside of the hard-core.
Public opinion has changed,'' said James Thurber, a political
scientist at American University. ''Most Americans just want the
boy to go back to his father.''
</P>
<P>
   Those seeking to prevent Elian from being returned to Cuba are
not lacking in commitment or energy.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very passionately held issue,'' said Florida Sen.
Bob Graham, a Miami Democrat whose staunchly anti-Castro views put
him in the same camp as conservative Sens. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and
Bob Smith, R-N.H., and Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind.
</P>
<P>
   It's company that Graham, with his middle-of-the-road voting
record, does not often find himself in.
</P>
<P>
   Graham now finds himself in the position of having to defend his
hometown against suggestions of extremism.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Miami community is a law-abiding community,'' Graham said.
But he adds: ''I believe while they will abide by whatever is
ultimately the decision of the law, their level of respect for the
decision will be very much influenced by how that legal
determination is reached.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-Americans in South Florida -- they still call themselves
exiles -- have a visceral view of Fidel Castro's tyranny, reinforced
each time another refugee reaches Florida's shores. Similar views
toward Castro exist in Hudson County, N.J., the largest
Cuban-American community outside Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But apart from these enclaves, other Americans, including other
Hispanics, do not seem to share the bottled-up frustrations or the
passionate antagonism toward Castro.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some lawmakers have suggested that the Elian Gonzalez
matter may actually lead to an improved U.S.-Cuban relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it reminds a lot of people around the country --
outside of Florida -- about the unique nature of our relationship
with Cuba and whether that ought to be revisited,'' said Senate
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. ''And I think a lot of people
think that. I know in South Dakota they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle advocates a ''new track'' toward Cuba with more
exchanges and interaction, a path he said had been gradually begun
by the Clinton administration
</P>
<P>
   That said, President Clinton has worked hard to court the
Cuban-American vote, as Gore is doing now. Miami's Cuban-Americans
helped Clinton become the first Democratic presidential nominee
since Jimmy Carter in 1976 to carry Dade County.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said in a recent interview
with The Associated Press that it has been difficult to improve
ties with Cuba, largely because of Castro, whom she called ''a
dinosaur in the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuba's shooting down of two Brothers to the Rescue planes in
1996, which claimed the lives of four airmen, ''made it
impossible'' to continue to improve relations. ''It's
unfortunate,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone has to admit up front that our relationship with Cuba
is different,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, those in Congress who want Elian to remain in this
country continue to press their impassioned case against Castro,
even if their words are not provoking a groundswell among
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ''Castro has used this father to manipulate both Cuba and the
United States,'' Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., prime author of the
neglected Elian citizenship bill, asserted Tuesday. ''And to this
point, Castro has been successful.''

<HEADLINE> Elian To Meet Father Washington  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno on Tuesday night
postponed a planned trip to Miami amid reports that Elian Gonzalez
would be brought to Washington for a meeting with his father.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest twist in Elian saga, a Cuban exile group held a
Capitol Hill news conference Tuesday night and announced that
Elian's Miami relatives would bring the 6-year-old shipwreck
survivor to Washington for a meeting with his father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, at noon Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But shortly before midnight, Lazaro Gonzalez, the great-uncle
who has been caring for Elian since he was rescued, emerged from
the house in Miami and declared that the meeting was off.
</P>
<P>
   He said Elian did not want to go to Washington, so no one from
the Miami family would go. The crowd erupted with cheers.
</P>
<P>
   A government official said that the Justice Department was still
trying to confirm that such a meeting would take place. An attorney
for the boy's father also would not comment on reports of a
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Mas Santos, chairman of the Cuban American National
Foundation, told reporters Tuesday night that Lazaro Gonzalez would
bring the boy to Washington for the long-awaited reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Mas said the meeting would be closed to all non-family members
except Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder and Sen. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J. He said the meeting would occur at noon at a
place yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
   ''After four and a half months, the private meeting that this
family has so yearned for with Juan Miguel Gonzalez tomorrow will
be a reality,'' Mas said. He said the family and the Justice
Department had both agreed to the details.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be at a neutral site, and there's basically
going to be a resolution of the situation,'' Jose Cardenas,
Washington director the Cuban exile group, told The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was announced at a Capitol Hill news conference.
Torricelli did not attend the news conference, but his spokesman,
Richard McGrath, confirmed that the senator was involved in the
negotiations to bring the boy to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''Senator Torricelli, Eric Holder and Greg Craig (the father's
attorney) worked out the arrangements,'' according to a source
close to the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath said Torricelli has been actively engaged in the issue,
but wouldn't confirm that a meeting had been arranged for
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The senator has been working for a period of time to keep
discussions going between the family and the Justice Department,''
McGrath said.
</P>
<P>
   A government official said Tuesday night that a Justice
Department letter to the Miami relatives has been drafted and
proposes that they transfer Elian at Opa Locka airport, near Miami,
on Thursday. That letter has not been sent and is on hold, pending
developments in Washington on Wednesday, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear late Tuesday to whom Elian would be transferred
Thursday under the government plan, but it would be either to Juan
Miguel if he goes to Opa Locka, or to another of Elian's
great-uncles, Manolo Gonzalez. The great-uncle would then fly with
the boy to another location to meet the father.
</P>
<P>
   If these sketchy reports about what might happen in Washington
Wednesday fall through, the government would then go ahead and send
the letter. It was because of the reports of a meeting that Reno
postponed her plan to go to Miami on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A source familiar with the ongoing discussions said it was
possible that the Miami relatives would travel to Washington with
Elian on Wednesday to meet with the father. This source said that
Juan Miguel's attorney, Greg Craig, had said that the father was
willing to meet with the Miami family but only if the boy was
transferred to him before that.
</P>
<P>
   Craig meet for two hours Tuesday afternoon with Reno and Holder,
and met the father Tuesday night at the home of Cuban diplomat
outside Washington. Craig left the house near midnight and refused
to answer questions shouted at him about the reported meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The source familiar with the discussions said that the plan was
for the Miami relatives to meet at noon in Washington with Juan
Miguel with no lawyers or government officials in the room, but the
source said Holder and Torricelli were supposed to be on hand in
the same building.
</P>
<P>
   This source noted that when the plan was announced Tuesday
evening, there was no mention of transferring Elian to Juan Miguel.
The source was unable to say whether this was because no transfer
was planned or because the Miami relatives and their allies did not
want to announce a transfer agreement until after they left Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, the Miami relatives asked to talk to the
father, but said they would only do so in Florida and added that
they would not relinquish the boy at such a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's possible return to her hometown -- where Cuban protesters
have displayed signs depicting her with horns and blaming her for
the Waco confrontation -- would come at a crucial time in the Elian
case.
</P>
<P>
   His Miami relatives have resisted her goal of reuniting the
6-year-old boy with his father this week, balking at handover plans
and continuing to press their court appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Arrangements were for the custody transfer were still being
worked out, said the official, who added that any meetings
involving Reno wouldn't alter the timetable being worked out for
Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
   Miami Mayor Joe Carollo, who discussed the situation with the
attorney general in Washington on Tuesday, said Reno was ''very
willing to meet Lazaro and any member of the Gonzalez family and
wants to meet with community leaders in Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   At Lazaro Gonzalez's house in Little Havana, where Elian has
been staying since he was rescued at sea while clinging to an inner
tube on Thanksgiving, five of his Miami schoolmates and his
principal stopped by to bring him a big card that read, ''Elian we
miss you.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been kept out of school recently because relatives
said they feared he would be taken away. The boy smiled and waved
goodbye to his classmates, then did a pull-up on the fence in front
the house and monkeyed around for TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   When the Miami relatives offered to meet with Elian's father,
they said they would bring the boy along if they were assured Elian
would not be taken during the reunion.

<HEADLINE> Asset Forfeiture Bill Appoved  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It took four years for a Chicago pizza parlor
to retrieve $500,000 in cash improperly seized in a drug raid. It
took three years for a Vermont woman to win back 10 acres seized
after police discovered two marijuana patches secretly grown by her
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   These were the kind of incidents cited by lawmakers as the House
approved a bill Tuesday that would make it tougher to seize
property connected to criminal acts.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, passed by a voice vote, had wide support, sponsored by
both Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate
Judiciary committees and backed by such diverse groups as the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce and the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has already passed the bill, and the president is
expected to sign it.
</P>
<P>
   Civil asset forfeiture, dating back to 19th century admiralty
laws, has become an effective crime-fighting tools, particularly
against drug traffickers, with nearly $500 million in crime-related
assets seized last year. But the practice has also been criticized
for being subject to abuse by zealous law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   The main thrust of the bill, which House Judiciary Committee
Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., has been promoting for seven years, is
to shift the burden of proof to the government. Currently, the
property owner must show that his property is ''innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary panel cited a 1993 case where police in a
Seattle suburb seized a Mexican restaurant as part of the arrest of
the brother of the owner who, without the knowledge of the owner,
was charged with selling a small quantity of cocaine in the
restaurant restroom. After five days of lost business and negative
media attention, the owner's lawyer got the decision reversed.
</P>
<P>
   North Dakota customs agents in 1997 seized the money of 14
circus employees crossing into Canada because together they carried
just over $10,000, the ceiling over which cash reporting forms must
be filled out.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1998, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Houston seized a
motel in a high-crime area of the city, charging that the owners
had ''tacitly approved'' alleged drug activity by guests in the
motel's rooms. There were no allegations that the owners
participated in any crimes, and the government, before dropping its
forfeiture proceedings five months later, at one point recommended
that the motel raise room rates as a security measure.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who would have believed that under our current law the
government could confiscate a person's private property on a mere
showing of probable cause?'' said Rep. John Conyers of Michigan,
top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to shifting the burden of proof to the government,
the bill allows federal judges to release property to the owner if
continued government possession causes substantial hardship to the
owner. It extends the time a property owner has to challenge a
seizure in court and ends the requirement that a person seeking to
recover property post a bond with the court worth 10 percent of the
property value.
</P>
<P>
   To win Justice Department approval, writers of the bill also
added several provisions to strengthen crime-fighting tools,
including giving federal courts the authority to issue civil
restraining orders when there is a strong probability the
government will prevail in a forfeiture and there is danger of the
property being destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is H.R. 1658.

<HEADLINE> Former ABC sportscaster, 52, alleges age discrimination  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A 52-year-old two-time Olympic gold medalist who
launched a successful broadcast career in the 1960s has filed a $50
million lawsuit against ABC Sports, alleging that she was chased
out of her job because of her age.
</P>
<P>
   Donna deVarona filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan late Monday, saying ABC terminated her most recent
employment with ABC Sports because of her age and gender.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit caps a 30-year-old broadcasting career that began
even as deVarona was setting 18 world swimming records.
</P>
<P>
   ABC responded to the lawsuit with a statement, saying: ''As a
result of the change in events covered by ABC Sports, including the
loss of the Olympics, deVarona's role had diminished greatly over
the years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ms. deVarona and her representatives were advised of this fact
over the years, and she was encouraged to look for work elsewhere.
We believe Ms. deVarona was treated fairly and that this suit has
no merit.''
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit, deVarona alleges ABC signed her to a free-lance
agreement as a sportscaster in 1991 and then treated her in an
''intentional, calculated, callous and opportunistic'' way to
appeal to a younger audience.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit said she was frequently frustrated by discriminatory
conduct during her initial broadcasting stint from 1965 through
1976, when she quit because she was ''unable to break the
discriminatory barriers facing a pioneering female sports
broadcaster.''
</P>
<P>
   She later returned to ABC, serving in 1980 as the first female
host of Olympic coverage at the games in Moscow and in 1983 as a
sportcaster and as an assistant to then-President of ABC Sports and
News Roone Arledge, a job she said she was reluctant to take
because of past discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   After signing the 1991 contract, deVarona began receiving fewer
assignments, often of inferior quality, and was paid less as ABC
Sports tried to reach younger television viewers with younger
sportscasters, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   She was advised by ABC executives that her age was detrimental
to her career advancement, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, it added, ABC Sports executives told her as she
pitched one of her programming ideas that the sports department was
focusing ''on younger demographics for all sports.''
</P>
<P>
   She said a woman who was a former vice president of ABC Sports
programming told her ABC Sports was eager to recapture the ''young
18 to 39 male market'' and that she should consider looking for
work elsewhere because her age was catching up to her.
</P>
<P>
   DeVarona began her sportscasting career at age 17, when she
agreed after the 1964 Tokyo Olympics to participate in a live
telecast at the Senior Men's National Swimming and Diving
Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, she covered ABC's Summer Olympics telecasts in
1968, 1972, 1976 and 1984 as well as Winter Olympics telecasts in
1984, 1988 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   By 1986, deVarona was working as an on-air host, writer and
producer, and in 1991 she won her first Emmy as a producer for a
Special Olympics presentation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, she was the lead reporter covering the Winter Olympics
ice skating battle between Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding.
</P>
<P>
   Other assignments sometimes included the Indy 500, the Super
Bowl, figure skating, gymnastics, track and field and the New York
City Marathon.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Bill Backing Gun Laws  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans followed through on their
promise to strengthen gun enforcement with a bill rewarding states
that impose tough mandatory minimum sentences on gun-toting
criminals. Democrats urged them to go a step further and support
tough gun safety legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The House, by 358-60, on Tuesday passed the ''Project Exile
Act'' that provides $100 million over five years in grants for
states that sentence people who use or carry firearms during a
violent crime or serious drug trafficking offense to at least five
years in prison without parole.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which still requires Senate action, echoes the GOP
theme that the answer to the nation's gun violence problem is not
more gun laws but better enforcement of laws already on the books.
The National Rifle Association, which has criticized the
administration for not adequately prosecuting gun violators, is an
ardent supporter of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, and most Democrats, went along with the bill
but said it provided too little money to make a difference and gave
political cover to Republicans resisting more comprehensive gun
control measures.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, seeking to move the gun safety debate outside
Washington, on Tuesday attended a ceremony in Maryland for the
first state law requiring built-in gun locks. He travels to
Colorado today to back an initiative requiring background checks
for gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every single day Congress waits, we lose 12 children, nearly
90 people overall, to gun violence. Congress should follow
Maryland's lead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is modeled after a mandatory minimum sentencing program
initiated by the Justice Department in Richmond, Va., once one of
the nation's most crime-ridden cities. Since its implementation in
1997 crimes involving guns have dropped by 65 percent and violent
crimes by 35 percent, although skeptics have pointed out that crime
rates in other Virginia cities without the program dropped by
similar rates.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., the chief sponsor, said the bill
sends ''gun wielding criminals an unmistakable message'' that gun
crimes won't be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia last year passed a statewide ''Project Exile'' bill,
making it one of six states, with Texas, Florida, Louisiana, South
Carolina and Colorado, that would qualify for funds under the
McCollum bill. The money can be used to defray costs associated
with tougher enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the bigger issue was the failure of Congress to
pass gun control measures introduced after the shootings at
Columbine High School in Colorado a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, top Democrat on the Judiciary
Committee, said the bill ''parrots the NRA line that we can't close
the gun enforcement loopholes in the law that allow criminals to
rearm.''
</P>
<P>
   He complained that he couldn't get a vote on a bill he is
sponsoring with Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., that would authorize
$150 million next year to hire 1,000 state and local gun
prosecutors, $53 million for 600 special agents and inspectors, $70
million to improve national instant criminal background checks and
$38 million to improve gun tracing and ballistic testing.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has proposed spending $280 million next year to
boost firearms enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Some bipartisanship was shown at the end of the day when the
House voted 406-22 on a nonbinding resolution stating that
House-Senate negotiators for a long-stalled gun control bill should
agree to both effective gun law enforcement and common-sense gun
safety measures.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which has languished since last summer, would promote
child safety locks, ban the importation of high-capacity ammunition
clips, bar juvenile possession of assault weapons, and prohibit
youths with criminal records from possessing handguns. The main
stumbling block has been how to define background checks for gun
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Conyers and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., agreed during floor debate to work on that remaining issue.
''We could have the makings of a decent gun bill,'' Hyde said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Elian May Meet Father Washington  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno on Tuesday night
postponed a planned trip to Miami amid reports that Elian Gonzalez
would be brought to Washington for a meeting with his father.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest twist in Elian saga, a Cuban exile group held a
Capitol Hill news conference Tuesday night and announced that
Elian's Miami relatives would bring the 6-year-old shipwreck
survivor to Washington for a meeting with his father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, at noon Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But shortly before midnight, Lazaro Gonzalez, the great-uncle
who has been caring for Elian since he was rescued, emerged from
the house in Miami and declared that the meeting was off.
</P>
<P>
   He said Elian did not want to go to Washington, so no one from
the Miami family would go. The crowd erupted with cheers.
</P>
<P>
   A government official said that the Justice Department was still
trying to confirm that such a meeting would take place. An attorney
for the boy's father also would not comment on reports of a
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Mas Santos, chairman of the Cuban American National
Foundation, told reporters Tuesday night that Lazaro Gonzalez would
bring the boy to Washington for the long-awaited reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Mas said the meeting would be closed to all non-family members
except Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder and Sen. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J. He said the meeting would occur at noon at a
place yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
   ''After four and a half months, the private meeting that this
family has so yearned for with Juan Miguel Gonzalez tomorrow will
be a reality,'' Mas said. He said the family and the Justice
Department had both agreed to the details.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be at a neutral site, and there's basically
going to be a resolution of the situation,'' Jose Cardenas,
Washington director the Cuban exile group, told The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was announced at a Capitol Hill news conference.
Torricelli did not attend the news conference, but his spokesman,
Richard McGrath, confirmed that the senator was involved in the
negotiations to bring the boy to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''Senator Torricelli, Eric Holder and Greg Craig (the father's
attorney) worked out the arrangements,'' according to a source
close to the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath said Torricelli has been actively engaged in the issue,
but wouldn't confirm that a meeting had been arranged for
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The senator has been working for a period of time to keep
discussions going between the family and the Justice Department,''
McGrath said.
</P>
<P>
   A government official said Tuesday night that a Justice
Department letter to the Miami relatives has been drafted and
proposes that they transfer Elian at Opa Locka airport, near Miami,
on Thursday. That letter has not been sent and is on hold, pending
developments in Washington on Wednesday, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear late Tuesday to whom Elian would be transferred
Thursday under the government plan, but it would be either to Juan
Miguel if he goes to Opa Locka, or to another of Elian's
great-uncles, Manolo Gonzalez. The great-uncle would then fly with
the boy to another location to meet the father.
</P>
<P>
   If these sketchy reports about what might happen in Washington
Wednesday fall through, the government would then go ahead and send
the letter. It was because of the reports of a meeting that Reno
postponed her plan to go to Miami on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A source familiar with the ongoing discussions said it was
possible that the Miami relatives would travel to Washington with
Elian on Wednesday to meet with the father. This source said that
Juan Miguel's attorney, Greg Craig, had said that the father was
willing to meet with the Miami family but only if the boy was
transferred to him before that.
</P>
<P>
   Craig meet for two hours Tuesday afternoon with Reno and Holder,
and met the father Tuesday night at the home of Cuban diplomat
outside Washington. Craig left the house near midnight and refused
to answer questions shouted at him about the reported meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The source familiar with the discussions said that the plan was
for the Miami relatives to meet at noon in Washington with Juan
Miguel with no lawyers or government officials in the room, but the
source said Holder and Torricelli were supposed to be on hand in
the same building.
</P>
<P>
   This source noted that when the plan was announced Tuesday
evening, there was no mention of transferring Elian to Juan Miguel.
The source was unable to say whether this was because no transfer
was planned or because the Miami relatives and their allies did not
want to announce a transfer agreement until after they left Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, the Miami relatives asked to talk to the
father, but said they would only do so in Florida and added that
they would not relinquish the boy at such a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's possible return to her hometown -- where Cuban protesters
have displayed signs depicting her with horns and blaming her for
the Waco confrontation -- would come at a crucial time in the Elian
case.
</P>
<P>
   His Miami relatives have resisted her goal of reuniting the
6-year-old boy with his father this week, balking at handover plans
and continuing to press their court appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Arrangements were for the custody transfer were still being
worked out, said the official, who added that any meetings
involving Reno wouldn't alter the timetable being worked out for
Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
   Miami Mayor Joe Carollo, who discussed the situation with the
attorney general in Washington on Tuesday, said Reno was ''very
willing to meet Lazaro and any member of the Gonzalez family and
wants to meet with community leaders in Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   At Lazaro Gonzalez's house in Little Havana, where Elian has
been staying since he was rescued at sea while clinging to an inner
tube on Thanksgiving, five of his Miami schoolmates and his
principal stopped by to bring him a big card that read, ''Elian we
miss you.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been kept out of school recently because relatives
said they feared he would be taken away. The boy smiled and waved
goodbye to his classmates, then did a pull-up on the fence in front
the house and monkeyed around for TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   When the Miami relatives offered to meet with Elian's father,
they said they would bring the boy along if they were assured Elian
would not be taken during the reunion.

<HEADLINE> Leaders in Havana Seek More Aid  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Complaining they have been left behind by the
global technology revolution, the world's poor nations are pushing
plans calling for more aid, fewer debts and a greater role in
international decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 heads of state or government and delegations from 80
other nations were to attend today's first summit in the 34-year
history of the Group of 77, which has swelled to a gathering of 133
developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   Draft resolutions prepared by foreign ministers urged ''the
establishment of a more just and fair international economic
system.''
</P>
<P>
   ''To those already enjoying them, the benefits of globalization
are clear: faster economic growth, higher living standards, the
rapid spread of new technology and modern management skills,'' U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Tuesday in a speech at the
University of Havana.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ''Many millions of people are excluded, left
behind in squalor not because they have been exposed to too much
globalization but because they have had too little or none at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the leaders joining Annan are South African President
Thabo Mbeki, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, Indonesian
President Abdurrahman Wahid, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   The wide-ranging draft proposals call for a sort of new world
order that would share technological advances, increase aid and
investment, forgive debts and put poor countries on a more equal
footing with rich ones in determining how aid is used.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, whose country chairs the
G-77, told a news conference Tuesday that poor countries need more
resources to promote democracy and stability.
</P>
<P>
   In Nigeria, where his elected government replaced a military
dictatorship last year, ''we have just established a new
dispensation, a democratic situation where we want to do everything
right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo said that if he goes to villagers and tells them, ''I
wanted to give you water but I have to pay debts ... even though
the origin of these debts are dubious, and therefore I will not be
able to give you water ... they will say 'get away with your new
dispensation''' of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But he ruled out a ''Havana Club of debtors'' that would unite
to suspend debt payments, saying it would interfere with aid
transfers that some nations depend upon for part of their domestic
budgets.
</P>
<P>
   The draft documents call for giving poor countries a greater
voice in development decisions by encouraging the United Nations to
take a bigger role in economic aid, rather than channeling it
through organizations controlled by rich nations.
</P>
<P>
   They also suggest easing patent restrictions that keep poor
nations from benefiting from new technologies and setting up
mechanisms to share inventions.
</P>
<P>
   The drafts urged preferential trade concessions for poorer
nations and freer movement of labor to match recent liberalization
of capital flows.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our peoples have run out of patience,'' Cuban Foreign Minister
Felipe Perez Roque told a meeting of foreign ministers Tuesday.
''For decades they have suffered broken promises and are today
living in an economic and social situation that is increasingly
serious and unsustainable.''

<HEADLINE> Civil rights panel preparing report on Giuliani, NYPD  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's New York Police
Department is expected to face sharp criticism from a
Democratic-tilting federal civil rights panel.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Civil Rights Commission is prepared to recommend that
an independent federal monitor oversee the police force, several
sources familiar with the commission's findings said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expect it to be very critical,'' one source said Tuesday of
the pending report.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-member commission has no enforcement powers but makes
recommendations. A draft copy of its report will be discussed at a
regularly scheduled meeting Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is basing its findings primarily on a May hearing
it held in New York City in the wake of the police shooting of
Amadou Diallo and torture of Abner Louima.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and police Commissioner Howard Safir defended the
police at that hearing. But the Rev. Al Sharpton and other police
department critics described the force as out of control and called
for a federal monitor to be assigned.
</P>
<P>
   Civil Rights spokesman David Aronson declined to discuss the
draft report's conclusions and what, if any, recommendations it
contains.
</P>
<P>
   Established by the Civil Rights Act of 1957, the commission
produces reports for the president, Congress and other federal
agencies on how federal, state and local government agencies treat
individual and group civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has six Democratic and two Republican appointees.
Among them is Christopher Edley, a Harvard Law professor and a top
adviser to President Clinton on race. That has prompted speculation
in GOP circles that the commission report was being used as a
political tool to help first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in her
U.S. Senate bid against Giuliani. Aronson denied that Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's poll numbers have sunk in recent weeks largely
because of his handling of the most recent police shooting in New
York. After Patrick Dorismond, 26, was shot by police in March,
Giuliani released the victim's sealed juvenile record, which showed
he had been arrested at age 13.
</P>
<P>
   Recent commission investigations include police practices in Los
Angeles following the 1991 Rodney King beating. In the report that
followed that probe, the commission made the unprecedented
recommendation that the county district attorney be removed from
police abuse cases.

<HEADLINE> 9-year-old girl raped by other students in school, police said  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Hours after she was allegedly coerced into
having sex with an 11-year-old boy near a Manhattan school
staircase, a 9-year-old girl was raped by two 12-year-old boys in
the same area, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was not the first sexual assault to occur this year
at Community School 200 in Harlem, police said Tuesday. On March
30, a 7-year-old boy allegedly sodomized a 7-year-old girl,
according to police reports. The girl was hospitalized and both
students are undergoing counseling, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest incident occurred shortly after 1 p.m. Monday, in a
foyer area leading to a staircase inside the school, police said.
The attacks occurred after teachers combined the boys' sixth-grade
class with the girl's fourth-grade class, bringing the students
into contact, police said. The classes were merged when the sixth
grade teacher was absent Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Margie Feinberg, a Board of Education spokeswoman, said the
classes were combined because the school did not have enough time
to get a substitute teacher for the sixth grade class.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-year-old boy somehow got the girl to leave the classroom
and go into the foyer area, where she was attacked, police said.
Upon returning to the classroom, the 12-year-old boys told the girl
they would tell on her if she didn't come with them into the foyer,
police said. The students left the classroom and the girl was
attacked again, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-year-olds ran away when they saw a school aide
approaching -- the aide summoned a school safety officer. The girl
then told the officer what happened and she was taken to Harlem
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-year-old boys were charged with rape and sodomy, and the
11-year-old was charged with sodomy. Thelma Baxter, the school's
superintendent, was slated to suspend the boys for a maximum of
five days after their Family Court appearance, which had not
occurred as of late Tuesday afternoon, Feinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Baxter spoke Tuesday with parents about the incident and safety
at the school. The city sent a crisis team -- made up of
professional counselors -- to counsel students and teachers at the
school, said Karen Crowe, another spokeswoman for the Board of
Education.

Elian May Meet His Father Washington
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno on Tuesday night postponed a
planned trip to Miami amid reports that Elian Gonzalez would be brought to
Washington for a meeting with his father. In the latest twist in Elian saga, a
Cuban exile group held a Capitol Hill news conference Tuesday night and
announced that Elian's Miami relatives would bring the 6-year-old shipwreck
survivor to Washington for a meeting with his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, at
noon Wednesday. But shortly before midnight, Lazaro Gonzalez, the great-uncle
who has been caring for Elian since he was rescued, emerged from the house in
Miami and declared that the meeting was off.

   AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) -- The Maine Legislature on Tuesday endorsed a bill that

the goal of the measure is to obtain the same level of prices for drugs in Maine
that are available across the border in Canada. State Sen. Chellie Pingree said
consumers in Maine and the rest of the nation deserve better treatment from drug
makers. The plan to create a Fair Drug Pricing Board won initial support from
the state Senate and the House of Representatives on Tuesday.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A consumer advocacy group urged the government Tuesday to
move faster to stop sales of Propulsid, a popular heartburn drug scheduled to be
pulled off the market this summer because it may cause deadly irregular
heartbeats. The Food and Drug Administration last month announced that Propulsid
was too dangerous for continued routine prescription, and worked with
manufacturer Janssen Pharmaceutica to create an unusual program allowing
Propulsid to be taken only by a limited number of patients with serious
illnesses.

Russia May Ratify Start II Treaty

   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian lawmakers agreed Tuesday to debate the long-delayed
START II arms treaty this week, following a ratification push from President
Vladimir Putin who is aiming for a landmark foreign policy move just weeks after
being elected. Lawmakers across the political spectrum predicted swift
ratification of the treaty that would halve the U.S. and Russian nuclear
arsenals to 3,000-3,500 warheads each. The debate is set for Friday. The treaty
was ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1996, but was repeatedly blocked by
Communists and hard-liners who dominated the State Duma, parliament's lower

<HEADLINE> Crash Victims Said Not Guinea Pigs  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Marine Corps' top general said he is
bothered that some family members of victims of last weekend's
Osprey aircraft crash believe the dead Marines were callously
sacrificed.
</P>
<P>
   One grieving mother, Christina Mercier, said her son,
24-year-old Keoki Santos, had been uneasy about the Osprey, a
hybrid airplane and helicopter that critics contend is
technologically troubled.
</P>
<P>
   Santos, a rifleman assigned to the 1st Marine Division, was
among 19 Marines killed when the MV-22 Osprey carrying them on a
training mission nose-dived into the ground Saturday night while
trying to land at an airfield in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Marines' deadliest air crash since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ''They killed him,'' Mercier said. ''They wanted him to be a
guinea pig for these new airplanes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. James Jones, commandant of the Marine Corps, said in an
interview Tuesday that family members deserve a clear explanation
of the Osprey and its history of extensive flight testing. He said
some have formed the mistaken view that the Osprey, which first
flew in 1989, is an experimental aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are certified airworthy aircraft,'' Jones said, on which
all tests have been completed. The Osprey that crashed was one of
four such aircraft participating in an exercise meant to evaluate
how they would coordinate with other Marine aircraft during a
real-life mission such as a hostage rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't put people at risk,'' Jones said. ''There is no such
thing as human guinea pigs in this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Osprey that crashed came off the production line in January
and had 135 hours of flight time.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Fred McCorkle, the Marines' top aviation official, told
a Pentagon news conference Tuesday that Jones was deeply troubled
by comments suggesting that the fatal Osprey flight was a risky
venture.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can tell you that his heart is broken that anyone feels that
way, and it's really because of misinformation,'' McCorkle said.
''These are operational aircraft that we plan on flying for years
in squadrons in the Marine Corps and are production aircraft and in
no way test aircraft. And we are trying to get the word out to the
families now to let them know that.''
</P>
<P>
   McCorkle told a Pentagon news conference that flights of the
remaining Ospreys would resume unless the initial investigation
reveals a major mechanical or design flaw. In that case, the Osprey
fleet would be grounded, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've talked to a lot of people on this particular accident ...
and I've had nothing so far to lead me to believe that we would
have to (ground) them,'' McCorkle said. Flights of the four
remaining production-model Ospreys were temporarily halted
immediately after the accident at Marana, Ariz., as a gesture of
sympathy for the families of the 19 Marines killed.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, McCorkle said, ''We have no indication what caused the
accident.''
</P>
<P>
   McCorkle said that on Tuesday the remaining Ospreys resumed
taxiing and other ground operations. ''I think that we will return
to the air in the very near future,'' he said without mentioning a
specific date.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Marines' plan to resume flying Ospreys before
the crash investigation is completed, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm.
Craig Quigley said, ''We are confident that the Marine Corps will
do the right thing and make the right decision as to when and under
what conditions flights will resume.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview Tuesday, Jones also said blast from the
explosion of the Osprey that crashed rocked another Osprey that had
arrived at the airfield first and was hovering nearby about 30 feet
off the runway. The jolt caused the Osprey to make a hard landing,
but it was not damaged, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers -- Boeing Co. and Bell Helicopter Textron -- are
due to deliver 11 Ospreys to the Marines this year. McCorkle said
those 11 will cost an average of about $57 million apiece.
Eventually the Marines are to field 360 of them to replace aging
CH-46 helicopters. The Navy plans to buy 48, and the Air Force will
get 50.

<HEADLINE> Louisiana Clings to French Roots  </HEADLINE>
By BRETT MARTEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- So what if French hasn't been the lingua
franca in Louisiana for almost 200 years?
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana -- itself named for France's King Louis XIV -- still is
loaded with reminders of France, from the city of Lafayette to the
capital, Baton Rouge, to Elysian Fields Avenue in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The tricolor still flies prominently above a statue of Joan of
Arc at Place de France near the French Quarter's French Market. New
Orleans even named a street after former French President Charles
de Gaulle.
</P>
<P>
   These are all reassuring symbols to the French, unabashed
exporters of their culture. And such reassurances seem to be what
keeps an official French presence here despite Louisiana's
diminished political and economic significance in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Established in 1804, the French Consulate in New Orleans has
seen a precipitous decline in its traditional responsibilities
since the mid-1980s, when growth in Southern cities such as Atlanta
and Miami began to take off.
</P>
<P>
   Pulling out now, many think, would produce a stinging response:
Non!
</P>
<P>
   ''I think a lot of French citizens would manifest their
displeasure with closing the consulate,'' said Bernard Maizeret,
the French consul general for Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Serious discussions about closing the consulate began after the
fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, when a number of Western nations
refocused diplomatic resources in Eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union, said Maizeret.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, an official French presence here has survived in
large part on national pride, while a number of other countries,
including Belgium, Germany, Italy and Holland, have withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana was claimed by the French explorer Sieur de La Salle
for King Louis XIV in 1682, and controlled by France for the better
part of the next 121 years, until the Louisiana Purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Maizeret estimates that nearly 300,000 Louisianans -- mostly in
the Lafayette area -- still speak French to some extent, and France
wants them to have every reason to continue to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the French care more about our French than Louisianans
do and I think it's important they keep their role,'' said Kermit
Bouillion, 48, of Lafayette, who owns a cafe in nearby Erath where
French Cajun bands play to packed houses. ''With the consul in our
state and the presence he has, I think people here are more proud
of their French background and speaking the language.''
</P>
<P>
   Bouillion and others who care about Louisiana's historical links
to France are pleased by ongoing renovations at the consul's Garden
District mansion, where signs of neglect had lent credence to fears
the office would close.
</P>
<P>
   The office was once the only official French presence in the
South, covering Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kansas,
Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, a French consulate opened in Miami, followed by one in
Atlanta in 1989. That, combined with an expansion of the Houston
office in 1991, reduced the New Orleans consulate's territory to
only Louisiana -- and the Houston office even took responsibility
for economic matters here.
</P>
<P>
   Such developments left the New Orleans office with the rather
unconventional raison d'etre -- as far as consulates go -- of
promoting French culture to a relatively small region.
</P>
<P>
   However, France boosted Maizeret's staff, adding a vice consul
to free up the consul general for public appearances, and a
language specialist to help coordinate Louisiana's French teaching
and immersion programs.
</P>
<P>
   The consulate works closely with the state Council for the
Development of French in Louisiana to recruit French teachers,
promote French-language publications and broadcasts, and organize
cultural exchanges. Several French or bilingual newspapers are
published in the state and French TV programs are shown
periodically in several areas.
</P>
<P>
   ''The French are so proud of who they are -- their culture and
language,'' said council spokesman Alan Brown. ''When they find a
willing audience like Louisiana, they're certainly not going to let
that slip away.''

<HEADLINE> Glickman To Make Sugar Decision  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman says a
decision is near on whether the government should buy $100 million
worth of surplus sugar to prop up domestic prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department is considering buying 250,000 tons of
sugar to give away overseas or to sell at a deep discount for
refining into ethanol, a gasoline additive.
</P>
<P>
   With domestic sugar prices down 25 percent from a year ago,
growers are threatening to forfeit to the government as much as
$550 million worth of sugar pledged as collateral on federal
marketing loans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got to act fairly soon,'' Glickman said at a Tuesday news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the government's sugar program, including candy
makers and consumer activists, say the USDA should allow sugar
prices to fall.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Richard Lugar,
said USDA never should have given loans to sugar farmers that
allowed for forfeitures.
</P>
<P>
   ''To compound that flawed decision with an unprecedented
sugar-buying bonanza is unjustified and should not be under
consideration,'' Lugar, R-Ind., said Monday in a letter to
Glickman.
</P>
<P>
   The government guarantees farmers a minimum price for domestic
sugar through the loan program and quotas on imports, but increases
in domestic production are making it difficult for USDA to control
domestic prices.
</P>
<P>
   Growers who put their sugar up as collateral for a federal loan
have the right to forfeit the crop to the government if prices fall
below the guaranteed price.
</P>
<P>
   The loan forfeitures could cost as much as or more than the
proposed sugar purchase, government analysts say.

<HEADLINE> Norwood Steers Health Care Debate  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY McMURRAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some call Rep. Charlie Norwood the ''ghost''
member of the congressional committee trying to reach a compromise
on health care reform. He's not physically on the panel, but is a
strong presence who spooks those who seek only moderate changes.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood, R-Ga., attends most of the committee meetings, sitting
quietly in the back of the room, arms crossed.
</P>
<P>
   ''They all know I'm in there,'' Norwood said. ''Don't you think
for a minute they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Norwood, a dentist elected to Congress in 1994, has become the
key figure as Congress attempts to reach a compromise on a health
care bill. He has enlisted the support of Democrats and vowed to
fight any ''watered-down'' proposal. Even opponents concede
Norwood's opposition likely would kill any plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Norwood is almost going to have veto power'' on the measure
crafted by the committee, Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., recently
told a business group that opposed the House health care bill,
which Norwood co-authored.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood wants people with health insurance to choose their own
doctors and hospitals. And he wants them to be able to sue their
insurance companies, something opposed by House Republican leaders
and the Senate GOP, who say costly litigation would drive up
premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood is a staunch conservative who generally is aligned with
the Republican majority. But he persuaded just under a third of his
GOP colleagues to vote for his reform measure last year. It passed
with near-unanimous support from House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   After the Senate passed its bill, a conference committee was
appointed. When House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., failed to
include Norwood on the panel, Norwood supporters cried foul.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unfair, and grossly so,'' said Rep. John Dingell, a
Michigan Democrat who co-authored the bill with Norwood. ''The
leadership deliberately stacked the conference, all of which is
morally wrong and raises serious ethical questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Norwood said he's not upset by the snub.
</P>
<P>
   ''A speaker can't afford to have too many rebels in his ranks,
or he can't govern,'' Norwood said, proceeding to rattle off the
numerous advantages of not sitting at the conference table.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd have to mind my manners. There would be protocol in there,
and I'd have to pretend to be grateful that I was on the
conference. From the outside, I can do whatever I need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Norwood said Hastert deserves credit for allowing the House to
debate the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''All he had to do was pick up the phone, and we would not have
had the debate at all,'' Norwood said. ''He let the House work its
will. It takes a good man to be able to do that. He knew when that
debate started we were going to win and he was going to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how close the conference committee is to a
compromise. Conferees were to meet last Thursday, but they canceled
it so they could talk in private.
</P>
<P>
   Though Norwood isn't privy to the private meetings, his
supporters on the conference -- whose names he won't divulge -- have
told him there has been movement.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't have to be exactly my way,'' Norwood said. ''That's
not a reasonable request. I don't care what words they use or how
they phrase it, but the intent of the bill has to be there for us
to pass it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Pollack, president of Families USA, a consumer advocacy
group which supported Norwood's bill, said he is confident Norwood
will deliver the votes if the committee emerges with a palatable
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Norwood thinks a proposal is sensible, he will bring most
of his colleagues with him.''

<HEADLINE> ASNE Chief: Newspapers Too Distant  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The death knell of the newspaper business has
been rung before, and always prematurely, through the ages of the
telegraph, radio and TV.
</P>
<P>
   But while newspaper editors doubt the Internet will manage to
slay their business, either, they aren't taking the competition
lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Good newspapers are going to be fine but the competitive
stakes are as high as they've ever been,'' William R. Burleigh,
president and CEO of E.W. Scripps Co., told the American Society of
Newspaper Editors on Tuesday at its annual conference.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., chairman of the New York Times Co. and
publisher of The New York Times, said newspapers have survived the
advent of other media because they have remained the best at
delivering news.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not the paper in newspaper that defines us,'' he said.
''It's the news in newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sulzberger said, ''You can't really tell where you're
going,'' in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The credibility of newspapers was commonly held out as their
best asset against the fragmentation of news and information
sources resulting from the explosive growth of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But that bond with readers has been frayed, according to an ASNE
study being released today that finds people perceive an aloofness
and bias in newspapers and think they make too many mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Papers tend to hear frustration and anger when they ask readers
how their communities are portrayed, said N. Christian Anderson
III, ASNE president and publisher of The Orange County Register in
California.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their mirror shows a different picture, and it says we have
not connected,'' he told the conference's opening session, in a
point geared especially to minority communities but meant for all.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we spend too much capital on coverage that shows
people living at the extremes of community issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said he saw no symptoms that the newspaper industry
will be fatally stricken by online competition.
</P>
<P>
   ''Still, over the long haul we must think and act differently,''
he said. ''We need to learn more about how our readers and would-be
readers live their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary B. Pruitt, president and CEO of the McClatchy Co., said
that with the multiplicity of news and information sources,
''virtually every media outlet is losing share.''
</P>
<P>
   But the narrative power of newspapers will see the good ones
through, he predicted.

<HEADLINE> Elian May Meet His Dad in D.C.  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno on Tuesday night
postponed a planned trip to Miami amid reports that Elian Gonzalez
would be brought to Washington for a meeting with his father.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest twist in Elian saga, a Cuban exile group held a
Capitol Hill news conference Tuesday night and announced that
Elian's Miami relatives would bring the 6-year-old shipwreck
survivor to Washington for a meeting with his father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, at noon Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But shortly before midnight, Lazaro Gonzalez, the great-uncle
who has been caring for Elian since he was rescued, emerged from
the house in Miami and declared that the meeting was off.
</P>
<P>
   He said Elian did not want to go to Washington, so no one from
the Miami family would go. The crowd erupted with cheers.
</P>
<P>
   A government official said that the Justice Department was still
trying to confirm that such a meeting would take place. An attorney
for the boy's father also would not comment on reports of a
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service,
Maria Cardona, said efforts had been under way late Tuesday and
early Wednesday to arrange a meeting between the father and Elian's
Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''While no meeting is yet officially confirmed, we continue to
focus on trying to get all of Elian's family to communicate and are
trying to resolve this promptly and cooperatively,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department official said the talks were continuing
into the early hours Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Mas Santos, chairman of the Cuban American National
Foundation, told reporters Tuesday night that Lazaro Gonzalez would
bring the boy to Washington for the long-awaited reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Mas said the meeting would be closed to all non-family members
except Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder and Sen. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J. He said the meeting would occur at noon at a
place yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
   ''After four and a half months, the private meeting that this
family has so yearned for with Juan Miguel Gonzalez tomorrow will
be a reality,'' Mas said. He said the family and the Justice
Department had both agreed to the details.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be at a neutral site, and there's basically
going to be a resolution of the situation,'' Jose Cardenas,
Washington director the Cuban exile group, told The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was announced at a Capitol Hill news conference.
Torricelli did not attend the news conference, but his spokesman,
Richard McGrath, confirmed that the senator was involved in the
negotiations to bring the boy to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''Senator Torricelli, Eric Holder and Greg Craig (the father's
attorney) worked out the arrangements,'' according to a source
close to the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath said Torricelli has been actively engaged in the issue,
but wouldn't confirm that a meeting had been arranged for
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The senator has been working for a period of time to keep
discussions going between the family and the Justice Department,''
McGrath said.
</P>
<P>
   A government official said Tuesday night that a Justice
Department letter to the Miami relatives has been drafted and
proposes that they transfer Elian at Opa Locka airport, near Miami,
on Thursday. That letter has not been sent and is on hold, pending
developments in Washington on Wednesday, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear late Tuesday to whom Elian would be transferred
Thursday under the government plan, but it would be either to Juan
Miguel if he goes to Opa Locka, or to another of Elian's
great-uncles, Manolo Gonzalez. The great-uncle would then fly with
the boy to another location to meet the father.
</P>
<P>
   If these sketchy reports about what might happen in Washington
Wednesday fall through, the government would then go ahead and send
the letter. It was because of the reports of a meeting that Reno
postponed her plan to go to Miami on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A source familiar with the ongoing discussions said it was
possible that the Miami relatives would travel to Washington with
Elian on Wednesday to meet with the father. This source said that
Juan Miguel's attorney, Greg Craig, had said that the father was
willing to meet with the Miami family but only if the boy was
transferred to him before that.
</P>
<P>
   Craig meet for two hours Tuesday afternoon with Reno and Holder,
and met the father Tuesday night at the home of Cuban diplomat
outside Washington. Craig left the house near midnight and refused
to answer questions shouted at him about the reported meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The source familiar with the discussions said that the plan was
for the Miami relatives to meet at noon in Washington with Juan
Miguel with no lawyers or government officials in the room, but the
source said Holder and Torricelli were supposed to be on hand in
the same building.
</P>
<P>
   This source noted that when the plan was announced Tuesday
evening, there was no mention of transferring Elian to Juan Miguel.
The source was unable to say whether this was because no transfer
was planned or because the Miami relatives and their allies did not
want to announce a transfer agreement until after they left Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, the Miami relatives asked to talk to the
father, but said they would only do so in Florida and added that
they would not relinquish the boy at such a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's possible return to her hometown -- where Cuban protesters
have displayed signs depicting her with horns and blaming her for
the Waco confrontation -- would come at a crucial time in the Elian
case.
</P>
<P>
   His Miami relatives have resisted her goal of reuniting the
6-year-old boy with his father this week, balking at handover plans
and continuing to press their court appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Arrangements were for the custody transfer were still being
worked out, said the official, who added that any meetings
involving Reno wouldn't alter the timetable being worked out for
Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
   Miami Mayor Joe Carollo, who discussed the situation with the
attorney general in Washington on Tuesday, said Reno was ''very
willing to meet Lazaro and any member of the Gonzalez family and
wants to meet with community leaders in Miami.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton in Denver on Gun Campaign  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Although President Clinton asked Congress to
pass new gun laws before the first anniversary of the killings at
Columbine High School, the White House acknowledges the deadline
will slip.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was to complain about Congress and the gun lobby today
while urging voters in Colorado to take their own steps for gun
control. A week before the April 20 Columbine anniversary, Clinton
was endorsing a state ballot measure that would impose new
requirements for buyers at Colorado gun shows, as Clinton wants to
do nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also planned to participate in a Denver town hall
gathering on guns.
</P>
<P>
   Two teen-age gunmen were among 15 dead at Columbine, in the
Denver suburb of Littleton. Clinton has frequently invoked the
killings as he argues for what he calls ''commonsense gun laws''
that include background checks for buyers at gun shows. The killers
got weapons from an acquaintance who easily bought them at a flea
market-style gun show.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado initiative is sponsored by Sane Alternative to the
Firearms Epidemic, a group formed after Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   It would require a background check before a vendor could sell a
gun at a gun show, with criminal misdemeanor penalties for
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Under current federal law, unlicensed dealers may sell weapons
in private transactions without subjecting the purchasers to a
background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would attend the SAFE rally after his own bill
became mired on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   A House-Senate conference committee has been assigned to
reconcile differences between a Senate-passed bill that would set a
72-hour background check on gun show sales and a House bill that
shrank the wait to 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The committee has met only once, in August, which the White
House attributes to political maneuvering by the National Rifle
Association.
</P>
<P>
   As the Columbine anniversary approached, White House aides
acknowledged this week that there is no chance of a national gun
show bill before April 20.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado visit is Clinton's second foray in two days to
promote gun control. On Tuesday he stood by as Maryland Gov. Parris
Glendening signed a law making that state the first to require
built-in locks on handguns while imposing other stringent
gun-control rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every single day Congress waits, we lose 12 children, nearly
90 people overall, to gun violence,'' Clinton said Tuesday in the
Maryland capital of Annapolis. ''Congress should follow Maryland's
lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress, however, was busy passing the Project Exile Act, a
$100 million package of financial incentives for states that set
mandatory sentences of five years without parole for criminals who
use or carry guns. The House approved the bill on a 358-60 vote --
to the delight of the National Rifle Association, which has accused
the Clinton administration of lax gun law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have Governor Glendening and President Clinton basically
engaging in political theater for the cameras, while the House of
Representatives was about the business of (serious) public
policy,'' said NRA chief lobbyist James J. Baker.

<HEADLINE> GOP Plans Drug Coverage for Elderly  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans are ready to unveil the
outlines of an election-year plan to make prescription drug
insurance available to senior citizens, with the government
subsidizing low-income individuals as well as those with unusually
high expenses for medication.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and other key Republicans
arranged a news conference today to present the proposal, which is
designed to serve as a counterpoint to President Clinton's plan for
optional, limited drug benefit available to all Medicare
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   According to a draft statement that circulated Tuesday night,
Republicans intend to say their proposal is affordable, available
and voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will reduce the cost of medicine, but not with an expensive
Washington-based, one-size-fits-all program that kills the research
and innovation of lifesaving cures,'' it says.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have set aside $40 billion in their budget over the
next five years to pay for prescription drug coverage, and their
proposal is designed to make insurance available to all
Medicare-eligible Americans, those 65 and older as well as some
disabled individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Key lawmakers have been laboring over the details in recent
weeks, with Hastert playing an unusual, personal role. He has
attended the meetings, and according to one participant who spoke
on condition of anonymity, has prodded rank and file lawmakers to
compromise their differences in the interests of a party position.
</P>
<P>
   The prescription drug issue has emerged as a key election-year
concern of both parties. Polls show it is popular with the voters,
and the strong economy has produced a surplus that permits
lawmakers to consider extending costly new coverage without having
to find offsetting spending cuts elsewhere in the budget.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans were acting at the same time Sen. William
Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, sent
letters to the members of his panel soliciting their views on the
subject. ''My purpose is to determine whether broad, bipartisan
consensus can be developed with respect to legislative action this
year in the major areas of Medicare reform, including views with
respect to the inclusion of a prescription drug benefit,'' he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Republicans said Tuesday night many key details of
their proposal were not ready for release, in part because the
Congressional Budget Office had not yet produced a precise cost
estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, no estimates were available of the cost of the coverage,
or whether it would call for co-pays for each prescription.
</P>
<P>
   In general, though, officials said the legislation would be
drafted to allow insurance companies to offer policies dedicated to
prescription drugs, based on a model the government would develop.
All Medicare-eligible individuals would be allowed to purchase the
insurance, and the government would pay the full premium for
everyone below a certain income level.
</P>
<P>
   That level is still to be determined, but would be roughly the
same as the poverty line. A partial subsidy would be available for
those with a slightly higher income, possibly 135 percent of the
poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   The government would step in to pick up the cost of very high
drug expenses for anyone with insurance, regardless of their
income, rather than have it born by the insurance companies.
Republicans declined to say at what point this ''stop loss''
provision would take effect.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker Seeking Egypt Funds  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Egyptian authorities, unhappy with the
suggestion that a co-pilot may have deliberately crashed EgyptAir
flight 990, still will be asked to contribute to the cost of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt asked the United States to help determine the cause of
last October's crash and a prominent congressman said Tuesday he
will seek reimbursement for some of the expected $17 million cost
of the analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian officials have angrily rejected suggestions that one of
the plane's co-pilots, who took the controls before he was
scheduled to do so, may have deliberately crashed the plane on Oct.
31, killing all 217 aboard including 101 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have found no indication of a mechanical or weather-related
event that could have caused the crash,'' National Transportation
Safety Board chairman Jim Hall said Tuesday in testimony for the
House Transportation aviation subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   He added that, while the cause remains undetermined, the
movements of the plane were ''consistent with a deliberate action
on the part of one of the crew members.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall told the subcommittee that his agency is recommending that
video recorders be installed in the cockpits of commercial
airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Such a recording, he said, might have helped settle questions
about what caused the Boeing 767 to plunge into the ocean off the
Massachusetts island of Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   He said the investigation has cost about $13 million to date. He
expects the final total to be about $17 million.
</P>
<P>
   Asked who was paying for the work, Hall said the money was
coming from the board's budget, adding that he planned to seek a
supplemental appropriation.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. William Lipinski, D-Ill., wondered whether the Egyptian
government had been asked to contribute to this cost.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't made that request,'' Hall said. ''I didn't feel it
would be appropriate for me, heading the investigation, to make the
request.''
</P>
<P>
   Lipinski responded: ''I'll see to it that the request is made by
someone for whom it isn't inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Frank LoBiondo, R-N.J., quickly seconded Lipinski,
expressing surprise that Egypt hadn't been approached earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The plane crashed in international waters, meaning the
investigation is the responsibility of Egypt, where the aircraft
was registered.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement sent to the subcommittee following the hearing,
the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority said Egypt already had
offered to help pay for the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over two months ago the government of Egypt offered Chairman
Hall financial support for the cost of the investigation. We were
informed that we would be contacted when this need arose. This
important point was not explained clearly at today's hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Hall's testimony, the Egyptian statement said it
was too early to rule out mechanical failure as the cause of the
crash or to determine that available data was consistent with a
deliberate act by a crew member.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee also raised the question of whether pilots
should receive psychological testing and whether standards need to
be tightened for ability to speak English.
</P>
<P>
   Associate FAA Administrator Thomas McSweeney said a general
psychological evaluation is a standard part of the semiannual
medical examination required for all commercial transport pilots.
</P>
<P>
   There was agreement on a need to be sure that foreign pilots
flying to the United States speak English.
</P>
<P>
   McSweeney noted that the International Civil Aviation
Organization recommends that English be used in international
flights. He said the FAA is working with that group to establish an
official glossary of terms to help avoid misunderstandings between
pilots and air traffic controllers.

<HEADLINE> Sharif Appeals Hijacking Conviction  </HEADLINE>
By ZAHID HUSSAIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) -- Ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
today appealed a life sentence from hijacking and terrorism
convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a good chance to get the decision reversed,'' said
Sharif lawyer Azizullah Sheikh, who filed the appeal in the
provincial Sindh High Court. ''There are very serious flaws in the
judgment. There is a definite lack of evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   An anti-terrorist court last week found Sharif guilty of
hijacking and terrorism but acquitted him of attempted murder and
kidnapping on Oct. 12, the day his dismissal of Gen. Pervez
Musharraf caused the army to seize power in Pakistan. Sharif was
accused of refusing to let a passenger airliner carrying Musharraf
and 197 others land in Karachi.
</P>
<P>
   After gaining full control, the army ordered the aircraft to
land. The plane apparently had only seven minutes of fuel remaining
when it touched down.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif's six co-defendants, including his younger brother
Shahbaz, were acquitted. However, the Musharraf-led government has
since filed several corruption charges against the men, who remain
in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution also has said it will appeal the acquittals.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-terrorist court that conducted Sharif's trial was set
up during his term in power to hand out quick justice.

<HEADLINE> For at least one day, Giuliani chooses baseball over politics  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In the end, a couple of speeches upstate didn't
have quite the same attraction as the home opener of the reigning
World Series champion Yankees. Especially if you are Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   So, instead of a campaign swing through Rochester and Buffalo,
Giuliani is headed for the Bronx today to take in opening day at
Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ''Long before I was a politician, I was a Yankee fan, what can I
tell you?'' the unrepentant mayor told a City Hall news conference
Tuesday. ''This is me. I'm a Yankee fan. I love the Yankees. I
haven't missed an opening day since I've been the mayor...I can't
imagine not being there when the Yankees opened, unless it was an
emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   And where will Hillary Rodham Clinton -- his rival for the U.S.
Senate and herself a self-proclaimed Yankees fan -- be that day?
She's opting for Buffalo, thank you very much.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton was asked about Giuliani's schedule change, she
managed a good-natured dig at the mayor's campaign and slipping
poll numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's had a tough couple of weeks. It might be good for him to
go to a game,'' Clinton said while campaigning in Albany on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's scheduling conflict arose after forecasts predicted
snow and rain for the city and baseball officials canceled
Tuesday's home opener against the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, who like all die-hard Yankees fans had waited all
winter for the game -- which will include a ceremony celebrating the
team's World Series victory last year -- had cleared his schedule in
anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the weather didn't cooperate and the mayor's schedule was
rearranged -- starting with the postponement of appearances before a
women's group in Rochester and a fund-raiser in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   The trip was seen as key because Giuliani has been criticized
lately for his lack of upstate campaign appearances. Recent polls
show that the mayor has surrendered his lead over Clinton and the
race has slipped into a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, Stephen Minarik III, the Republican Party
chairman in Monroe County, which encompasses Rochester, said he
understood Giuliani's choice of a baseball game uptown instead of a
campaign event upstate -- even though his wife had been involved in
the planning.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is the mayor of the city of New York (and) the New York
Yankees are an institution within the city of New York, so let's
cut the guy some slack,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Davis, Erie County's Republican Party chairman, agreed,
saying Buffalonians would not hold it against the mayor come
November.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's doing the right thing,'' said Davis. ''I'm a big baseball
fan, I understand. People understand. Buffalo is a Yankees town
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis added that the postponement of Giuliani's trip to Buffalo
gives him an opportunity to take in a home opener of his own: The
Buffalo Bisons, the Triple A affiliate of the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Davis however, did have one minor regret. ''I wish he had
invited me to sit next to him at the Yankees game,'' he said.

for married couples.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats put the brakes Tuesday on the GOP's 10-year, $248
billion tax cut in a bid to force Senate votes on some of their
priorities, such as a prescription drug benefit for Medicare and
their own ''marriage penalty'' bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want to hold up a good debate ... but a good debate
entails offering alternatives, other ideas,'' said Senate Minority
Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican bill, intended partly to ease the penalty paid by
25 million two-income couples, would expand the 15 percent and 28
percent income tax brackets so that they apply to a greater share
of a married couple's income.
</P>
<P>
   It also would expand the earned income tax credit for
lower-income couples and ensure that taxpayers could continue
claiming personal credits, such as the $500-a-child credit, without
getting caught up in the alternative minimum tax.
</P>
<P>
   Unless a deal is reached on which amendments Democrats can
offer, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said senators
will vote Thursday on whether to end the filibuster and take up the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''For 10 years, we have talked about the unfairness of the
marriage penalty tax,'' Lott said. ''We're going to see who is for
eliminating it and who is not.''
</P>
<P>
   The gas tax vote was the first of many on issues that Republican
congressional leaders scheduled for this week to highlight their
tax-cutting priorities in these final days of the income-tax filing
season.
</P>
<P>
   By 17 votes, the Senate failed to reach the 60-vote threshold
necessary to cut off debate and proceed to the bill, effectively
killing it. Twelve Republicans and 44 Democrats voted against the
measure, with 43 Republicans in favor.
</P>
<P>
   The gas tax bill would have rolled back 4.3 cents of the federal
gas tax for the rest of the year and suspended the entire 18.4-cent
tax if average prices exceed $2 a gallon. The issue has lost some
of its steam as the gas tax price rise has slowed and oil-producing
nations agreed to increase their output.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the tax rollback, however, said the relief wouldn't
amount to much for the average motorist, even if it were passed
along by the oil companies. They said it would jeopardize $6
billion a year for transportation projects, even though Lott said
the bill would use surplus dollars to make up the losses.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot backfill the potholes this bill will leave,'' said
Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, the House voted 424-0 for legislation to bolster
taxpayer rights in dealing with the Internal Revenue Service and
better protect private tax information from computer hackers. The
bill, which now goes to the Senate, also would make changes in tax
penalties and interest, including making interest on IRS
overpayments tax free.
</P>
<P>
   In a symbolic vote, the House signaled opposition by 420-1 to
the tax increases in President Clinton's fiscal 2001 budget.
Democrats derided that effort as a political stunt intended only to
embarrass the president and curry favor with voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to wonder if this isn't some form of electioneering,
instead of substantive tax policy,'' said Rep. Jim McDermott,
D-Wash.

<HEADLINE> Man Shoots Two Girls, Kills Self  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PERRIS, Calif. (AP) -- A man shot two little girls, fatally
wounding one of them, and then killed himself after holding their
mother captive for three days and repeatedly raping her because she
tried to end their relationship, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Onemeous Phillion James, 46, killed himself Monday inside the
couple's home after the woman fled to a neighbor's home for help.
</P>
<P>
   The girls, ages 2 and 6, were shot in the head. The younger
girl, identified as James' daughter, died late Tuesday, the
Riverside County Coroner's office said.
</P>
<P>
   The other girl was the woman's daughter from another
relationship. She was in critical condition late Tuesday, said
sheriff's Sgt. Perri Feinstein-Portales.
</P>
<P>
   James bound the woman with duct tape and held her that way
through the weekend, sexually assaulting her numerous times,
Feinstein-Portales said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the woman convinced James that she would not run away
if she was released, but she went to a neighbor's home and called
for help.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies found James dead on a bed. The two girls were found
shot in the same room.
</P>
<P>
   Perris is about 60 miles east of Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo's Governor Defends Comments  </HEADLINE>
By MARI YAMAGUCHI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo's outspoken governor today defended comments
in which he told Japanese troops to expect foreigners living in
Tokyo illegally to riot if a major earthquake strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Shintaro Ishihara's remarks stirred up a storm of protest. But
the governor -- well known for his nationalist, right-wing views --
said today that he has no intention of backing down.
</P>
<P>
   Ishihara said he was referring only to foreigners living
illegally in Japan and blamed the media for taking his comments out
of context.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why should I apologize?'' he said. ''Was there anything wrong
with what I said?''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing a ceremony for army troops on Sunday, Ishihara said
foreigners living in Tokyo illegally have ''repeatedly committed
atrocious crimes'' and suggested the military should be on alert
because they ''could be expected to riot'' if a major disaster were
to hit the city.
</P>
<P>
   Government leaders were quick to distance themselves from
Ishihara's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea objected and North Korea called the statements
''heinous.'' About 700,000 Koreans live in Japan, making them the
largest minority. Many are descendants of laborers forced to work
here during Japan's colonization of the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Ishihara's remarks were particularly insulting to Koreans here
because thousands were massacred after a 1923 earthquake because of
untrue rumors they had poisoned wells and were setting fires, the
Mainichi, one of Japan's largest newspapers, said an editorial
today.
</P>
<P>
   ''Surely, Gov. Ishihara has not forgotten that,'' the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper also pointed out that foreigners did not riot
after a 1995 earthquake killed more than 6,000 people in the port
city of Kobe, despite a large foreign community in the city.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, Ishihara also used a derogatory term for
people from Korea and Taiwan living in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Ishihara is trying to use foreigners as a scapegoat at
a time when many people are feeling insecure about the economy and
the political situation,'' Hitomi Yamamoto, a Tokyo assemblywoman,
said at a small rally outside City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Ishihara said today that he stood by his use of the word but did
not intend it to include Koreans or Chinese living in Japan
legally.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he reiterated that he considers illegal foreign
residents, ''which includes many Chinese,'' to be
''troublemakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ishihara's comments, though hardly mainstream, are not without
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese have long cited ethnic and cultural homogeneity as
a factor behind the country's high degree of social order and
relatively low crime rates. Many fear a greater foreign presence
will disturb that, even though economists say Japan must accept
more immigrants to counter low fertility rates and fuel economic
growth.

<HEADLINE> Warriors 109, Grizzlies 97  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Larry Hughes scored 28 points and Jason
Caffey and Mark Davis each added 25 as the Golden State Warriors
beat the newly purchased Vancouver Grizzlies 109-97 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the first for the Grizzlies under owner Michael
Heisley, whose purchase of the team was approved unanimously
earlier in the day by the NBA's Board of Governors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could not be happier to be approved as the owner of the
Grizzlies,'' Heisley said. ''Basketball is the greatest sport in
the greatest league in the world and I am honored to join the
esteemed ranks of NBA owners.''
</P>
<P>
   Heisley said he would have no immediate comment on the futures
of coach Lionel Hollins and general manager Stu Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Adonal Foyle added 15 points for the Warriors, who won
consecutive games for the first time since late February and took
the four-game season series with the Grizzlies 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dickerson scored 24 points to lead Vancouver, which kept
it close until Golden State pulled away at the end, outscoring the
Grizzlies 31-20 in the fourth quarter. Shareef Abdur-Rahim added 23
points and had 13 rebounds and Othella Harrington had 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   Down by one at the break, Golden State put together a 10-0 burst
-- including eight straight points by Hughes -- to move ahead 64-60
midway through the third quarter and took a 78-77 lead into the
final period.
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors took control from there, starting the fourth with a
14-2 run that carried them to a 92-79 lead, the first double-digit
lead of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Caffey had six of his points in the burst and Davis, making his
third straight start for injured Donyell Marshall, punctuated it
with a steal and putback followed by a reverse two-handed dunk off
a lob pass from Mookie Blaylock.
</P>
<P>
   Abdur-Rahim converted a three-point play but it wasn't enough to
break up the Warriors' momentum. Tony Farmer and Davis each
finished fast breaks with layups and Hughes hit a 17-foot jumper to
put Golden State up by 14 with 5:40 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Grizzlies didn't threaten after that.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson had 17 points in the first half when the Grizzlies
took a 54-53 lead. Vancouver had gone in front 48-41 after
Abdur-Rahim's dunk off a feed from Bibby and Obinna Ekezie's 4-foot
jumper. But the Warriors outscored Vancouver 12-6 over the last
3:57 of the period, pulling back within a point on a pair of free
throws by Hughes.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Marshall, who hasn't played since aggravating a knee injury
Friday against Utah, will miss the rest of the season. ...
Abdur-Rahim has scored in double figures in 74 of 77 games this
season.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Split Over Ethanol Issue  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farm-state lawmakers want to make sure that
motorists keep using ethanol, a gasoline additive made from corn,
but they don't agree on how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is considering whether to repeal clean-fuel standards
that required gasoline in cities with smog problems to have an
oxygen-enhancing additive such as ethanol or MTBE.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is moving to ban MTBE, the most
popular additive, because the petroleum-based compound has been
found to be contaminating underground water supplies. That would be
a boon for the ethanol industry, except that states are pushing
Congress to repeal the oxygenate requirement so they don't have to
switch from MTBE to ethanol.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., told the Senate
Agriculture Committee Tuesday that Congress should eliminate the
oxygenate rule and replace it with a requirement that a certain
amount of fuel used nationwide be made from renewable resources,
such as corn or other plant matter.
</P>
<P>
   The ethanol industry risks a public backlash if the oxygenate
standard is not repealed, he said. ''Support for the oxygenate rule
is guaranteed to weaken even more over time.''
</P>
<P>
   But other lawmakers say it would be a mistake for ethanol
supporters to go along with eliminating the oxygenate requirement
since it guarantees that there would be demand for ethanol when
MTBE can no longer be used.
</P>
<P>
   The oxygenate rule ''has produced astounding benefits in
reducing air pollution, and ... it makes no sense to gut the Clean
Air Act simply because one of the oxygenates -- MTBE -- is
contaminating water,'' Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said in a
letter Tuesday to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman.
</P>
<P>
   The ban on MTBE would raise farm income by $1 billion, or more
than 2 percent a year, if it is replaced by ethanol, according to
Agriculture Department projections.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is under pressure from Northeast states to do away with
the oxygenate standard so they don't have to use either ethanol or
MTBE. California, which is banning MTBE on its own, has asked the
Environmental Protection Agency for a waiver from the rule.
</P>
<P>
   ''The economic impact of mandating the use of ethanol in the
Northeast, California and the Gulf Coast is simply unknown,'' said
Jason Grumet, who represents the air-control agencies of eight
northeastern states.
</P>
<P>
   The oil industry opposes both the oxygenate rule and the
proposed renewable fuels standard. The Clinton administration
supports Daschle's position.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 Clean Air Act led to widespread use of MTBE, or methyl
tertiary butyl ether, by requiring gasoline in areas with serious
air pollution to contain at least 2 percent oxygen by weight.

<HEADLINE> Official Accused in Campaign Case  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal employment board is considering
prosecutors' charges that the director of a regional Environmental
Protection Agency office illegally solicited money for a
congressional candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Office of Special Counsel accused Bill Yellowtail on
Tuesday of breaking election laws by helping raise money for a
Montana candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Yellowtail, director of the region covering Colorado, Utah,
Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota, is the
highest-ranking federal official to face such a charge since at
least 1995, said Jane McFarland, spokeswoman for the Office of
Special Counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors allege Yellowtail broke the law by allowing his name
to be attached to a 1998 letter seeking campaign donations for
Robert ''Dusty'' Deschamps, a Democrat running for Montana's lone
U.S. House seat. ''Contributing now to Dusty's campaign is
absolutely critical,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Yellowtail, a former Montana state senator, resigned from his
EPA post to make an unsuccessful run for the Montana House seat in
1996. He was reappointed to the EPA job in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Lathrop, a spokesman for the regional EPA office, said the
agency has not decided whether to take any action against
Yellowtail.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know anything more than is in the (Office of Special
Counsel) press release. ... These are serious charges,'' Lathrop
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yellowtail did not return a phone call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   The petition with the federal Merit Systems Protection Board
accuses Yellowtail of violating the Hatch Act, a federal law
banning campaign activity by government workers.
</P>
<P>
   If the board agrees Yellowtail broke the law, it could order his
firing, McFarland said. The minimum penalty for a Hatch Act
violation is a 30-day suspension, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Special Counsel, an independent agency of federal
prosecutors, brings about four Hatch Act cases a year, McFarland
said.

<HEADLINE> Cops Review Tape of Kennedy, Guard  </HEADLINE>
By RACHEL ZOLL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Rep. Patrick Kennedy has refuted
allegations that he grabbed and shoved a security guard at Los
Angeles International Airport last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''When all the facts become public, people will see that the
press reports don't reflect what actually happened,'' Kennedy said
in a brief statement Tuesday night. ''I apologized for this
unfortunate incident at the time and continue to regret that it
occurred. I sincerely hope that this matter can be resolved soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Patton, 58, said Kennedy grabbed and pushed her the night of
March 26, after she told him his bag was too big to fit through an
X-ray scanner.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman, son of Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., then
allegedly grabbed Patton's arm and cursed at her while ordering her
out of the way. Patton complained of injuries to her left shoulder.
She filed a battery complaint with police on or about April 1.
</P>
<P>
   No charges have been filed against Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Patton, reached at her home Tuesday, said she was in pain but
declined further comment. She referred calls to her attorney, Paul
Trump, who did not return calls.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives have reviewed a surveillance video of the incident,
but have not made it public.
</P>
<P>
   ''It shows there appears to have been physical contact between
Ms. Patton and Mr. Kennedy,'' Los Angeles police Lt. Horace Frank
said. ''She said she was battered at a preboard checkpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   William Lynch, chairman of the Rhode Island Democratic Party,
accused Patton of distorting the facts to profit at the
congressman's expense.
</P>
<P>
   ''She started to look at this thing and heard cash register
sounds in her head,'' said Lynch, who said he discussed the
incident with Kennedy two days ago.
</P>
<P>
   He said Kennedy had some ''inadvertent contact'' with Patton but
he did not grab or shove her, as she claims.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's resigned to the fact that because his name is Kennedy,
these types of things that ordinarily wouldn't mean anything are
totally blown out of proportion,'' Lynch said Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> GOP Plans To Push Final Budget  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are ready to push a compromise
$1.8 trillion budget through Congress now that House-Senate
bargainers have resolved their differences over taxes, defense and
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional aides said Tuesday that having bridged their major
gaps, the House would vote on the fiscal 2001 spending plan on
Thursday, with the Senate voting later that day or Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The aides, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
compromise will allow a five-year tax cut of at least $150 billion
and up to about $215 billion. That is about $25 billion less than
the House approved and $25 billion more than the Senate provided.
</P>
<P>
   The budget will set aside up to $40 billion for the possible
creation of a new Medicare prescription drug benefit and other
overhauls in the health-insurance program for the elderly and
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   But gone is Senate-approved language that would have let any
senator bring a prescription-drug bill to the chamber's floor by
Sept. 1 if there had been no prior legislative action on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The budget will also contain the Senate-approved figure of $311
billion for defense for 2001, $4 billion more than the House's
number and 7 percent more than this year.
</P>
<P>
   The budget sets overall tax and spending figures, but leaves
specifics for later legislation. It does not need President
Clinton's signature.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP budget also plans $1 trillion in debt reduction through
2005. It assumes spending increases for education, veterans and
biomedical research and unspecified reductions in other domestic
programs, but such decisions will await later bills.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Congress Looks To Help Old Workers  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress is brainstorming more ways to help
older Americans stay at work as employers complain of labor
shortages caused by the humming economy and a huge wave of baby
boomers nears retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to make sure federal laws don't hurt older workers.
Our economy will depend on it,'' said Sen. Charles Grassley,
R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging.
</P>
<P>
   Already this year, Congress has repealed the Social Security
earnings limit, removing the threat of reduced federal retirement
benefits for those who continue to work past age 65. President
Clinton signed that legislation into law Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Now lawmakers are considering how to break down private-sector
barriers for older workers. The aging committee explored options at
a hearing last week.
</P>
<P>
   Among the ideas being considered are changing federal tax and
pension laws to encourage phased retirement plans that could allow
older people to collect partial pensions while continuing to work
part time.
</P>
<P>
   That would benefit people like Sherman Sorem of Marshalltown,
Iowa, who after 35 years of service took an early retirement
buy-out when he was 61 and his company, Fisher Controls
International, downsized. He was offered a lower-paying,
less-demanding job. But that would have ultimately meant a lower
pension since, like most corporate retirement plans, his was based
on earnings during final years of service.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said no, you're not going to beat me out of that, I'll take
early retirement,'' said Sorem.
</P>
<P>
   Now, because Sorem has needed expertise, the company asks him to
come back to work for a few weeks each year. The new earnings law
signed by Clinton means he no will longer have to limit that work
for fear of losing Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But Sorem, now 65, and his wife Nancy, 62, wonder why there
wasn't a better way to handle the situation, since he's willing to
work part time and the company needs him.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said if he could work long enough he would put a boat in
the backyard,'' Nancy Sorem said.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the elderly say better age discrimination laws
also may be needed to ensure that older workers get equal
opportunities for training to keep up with changing technology.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of the time it is a subtle discrimination that occurs,''
said Joseph Perkins, president of the AARP, the nation's largest
organization of older adults.
</P>
<P>
   Like Social Security, many laws and attitudes shaping today's
retirement options developed around the time of the Great
Depression, when high unemployment made it desirable to encourage
older Americans to leave the work force.
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed. Now a thriving economy creating plentiful
jobs has many employers scrambling to hold on to workers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the huge baby boom generation has reached middle age.
Rising life expectancies mean many will live for decades past what
has been considered ''normal'' retirement age, between ages 60 and
65.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 13 percent of Americans currently aged 65 and older
work, according to AARP. But a 1998 AARP poll of baby boomers found
that eight in 10 intend to keep working at least part time in old
age -- because they think they will need extra cash, or for
pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Hy-Vee Inc., a supermarket chain with 210 stores across the
Midwest, is an example of a company that is taking steps to attract
and keep older workers.
</P>
<P>
   The changing economy and demographics means ''recruitment and
retention of older workers becomes and imperative as well as a
desire and goal,'' said vice president Steve Meyer.
</P>
<P>
   In help-wanted advertisements, Hy-Vee promises flexible
scheduling -- including three-season jobs allowing for winters spent
in warmer climes -- to entice older workers. ''Your experience and
maturity are assets we find valuable to our success,'' the ads say.
</P>
<P>
   A 1999 survey of more than 500 large corporations by Watson
Wyatt Worldwide benefit consultants found that 16 percent are
experimenting, like Hy-Vee, with more flexibility for older
workers.
</P>
<P>
   However, concern about legal or tax ramifications may be holding
more companies back. Traditional pension plans still must follow
old laws that often result in penalties against people who work
past a certain age.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers plan to offer legislation this year that would
make it easier for companies to design phased pensions, by allowing
partial collection of benefits by workers at age 59{.
</P>
<P>
   That's similar to rules governing 401(k) retirement savings
accounts, a newer employee benefit that is increasingly popular,
but does not have the advantage of guaranteeing a continuous
old-age income, as pensions do.
</P>
<P>
   Among proponents of pension changes, Rep. Earl Pomeroy, D-N.D.,
said, ''it would help employers trying to hold some of their most
experienced employees who want to draw some retirement benefits,
yet stay working.''

<HEADLINE> Census Officials Feeling Encouraged  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Residents of Laureldale, Pa., heard about it
when they walked through borough offices, and got messages about it
stuffed into their utility bills. There were even occasional,
gentle reminders from municipal workers when they stopped by to
talk to Mayor John Kahn, Sr.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere people went in the small, working-class borough, it
seemed, people were urging them to mail back their census forms,
Kahn said. And that's just what most residents did. The 83 percent
of households in Laureldale that returned a form gives it one of
the highest response rates in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Census director Kenneth Prewitt says he is encouraged since the
national response rate was 62 percent as of Tuesday, surpassing the
61 percent minimum goal he had set in planning for this year's
count. He hopes that more communities like Laureldale will help
boost response rates further, in spite of recent criticism that
some of the things asked on the 53-question long form were too
intrusive.
</P>
<P>
   While some states, particularly in the South, continue to lag
behind the national numbers, others have surged ahead, giving hope
to Prewitt that as many forms will be returned this year as in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got my fingers crossed,'' Prewitt said. ''This suggests
that we will meet the 1990 rate of 65 percent. That would be quite
a serious accomplishment not just by the Census Bureau, but by the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Response rates have declined each year since 1970 -- from 78
percent to 75 percent in 1980 and 65 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau will release final response rate figures on
April 18. After that, the rate of forms mailed back is expected to
be reduced to a trickle, and Census officials will prepare to send
temporary workers out to homes that did not send back a form. That
operation begins on April 27.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials say they are encouraged by positive numbers in
some states and local communities. For instance, Macomb County,
Mich., has one of the highest response rates among all counties at
78 percent. Regional director Tom Chodzko says they tried a number
of different things -- including stuffing fortune cookies with
''Census 2000'' messages -- to get people to return forms.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn, the Laureldale mayor, said he completely filled out the
long form he received in the mail but still thought some of the
questions invaded his privacy -- such as ''What is your annual
income?'' or ''Do you have plumbing at home?''
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday, 64 percent of all short forms were mailed back,
and 50 percent of long forms, Prewitt said. The 14 percent gap was
two points larger than recorded last week.
</P>
<P>
   As with some congressional Republicans, Kahn, a Democrat, said
he suggested to residents concerned about intrusive questions to
leave them blank. But Kahn says he's also urged them to fill it
completely if they can.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're a small town. The (borough) secretaries did whatever we
had to to get the word out. We told them when they walked in. It's
a camaraderie thing,'' Kahn said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I suspect that in the next week as questionnaires continue to
come in that the mail response rate will inch even higher,'' said
Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the House Government Reform
Committee's census panel. He has urged people to fill out the whole
long form.

<HEADLINE> Sens. Push Transplant Proposal  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER LOVEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An effort by a
transplant-surgeon-turned-senator to broker a compromise on how to
distribute the nation's limited supply of donated organs to
transplant patients was set to move forward today, even as
negotiations continued.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, patients who live in the same area as
donors get the first crack at organs, even if a sicker patient
lives just outside the area.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has proposed requiring broader
sharing of organs and basing organ distribution on who is most in
need of a transplant rather than on geography. The Department of
Health and Human Services also wants to increase its authority over
the private company, United Network for Organ Sharing, that holds
the government contract to run the distribution system.
</P>
<P>
   But United Network and many transplant centers -- particularly
smaller hospitals -- fear that eliminating geographic barriers would
siphon away locally donated organs to other centers and jeopardize
their programs.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is which side should have the power to write rules
governing the distribution of organs, and what those rules should
be. Rather than a partisan issue, it generally pits lawmakers from
major recipient states that have large transplant centers against
those from high-donor states where patients now get transplants
fairly quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., a former heart and lung transplant
surgeon, has attempted for months to settle the dispute between HHS
and the network.
</P>
<P>
   His still-evolving proposal would allow the transplant network
to write allocation policy. But if HHS and the private contractor
cannot agree, an expert committee would make the final policy
decisions, based on a set of guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Frist met Tuesday with HHS Secretary Donna Shalala and Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., to try to work out a compromise. Shalala
wants the guidelines to explicitly call for sharing organs over
much larger geographic areas, but Frist has resisted.
</P>
<P>
   No deal was reached in the meeting, but Senate staff were
continuing to talk. On Wednesday, the Senate Health, Education,
Labor and Pensions Committee was set to consider Frist's bill, with
or without a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a bipartisan group of senators hinted on Tuesday they
would block any legislation that allows organs to continue to go to
the closest patients rather than to the sickest.
</P>
<P>
   The House has backed United Network, passing legislation that
would strip HHS of its authority to set policy and overturn its
proposed new rules. The Clinton administration has promised a veto.
</P>
<P>
   The group, led by Sens. Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill., and Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., unveiled a proposal that essentially mirrors the
new Clinton administration regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your zip code has a lot more to do with your receiving an
organ than your state of health,'' said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill.,
who joined Fitzgerald, Schumer and Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa.
''That's just wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The senators said they would wait to see what Frist's final bill
looks like before deciding on a strategy. But they said that
anything that does not increase public accountability is
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will pass a good bill in the United States Senate, or we
will pass no bill,'' Santorum said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 4,800 people die each year -- about 13 per day --
waiting for organ transplants. There currently are 68,530 people
waiting for transplants.

<HEADLINE> House Chaplain Conducts Mass  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER LOVEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The new House chaplain says he hopes other
groups follow the Republican Party's events honoring him with
invitations of their own, to help the nation put behind it the
highly divisive partisanship that surrounded his selection as the
first Catholic for the post.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's special Mass and reception put on by the
Republican National Committee are being criticized by Democrats as
a blatant attempt to mend fences with Catholics. The influential
group accounts for a quarter of the vote in national elections, but
was bruised by the protracted battle over who would be the new
chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Daniel P. Coughlin's appointment last month followed a
bitter process during which some Democrats accused GOP leaders of
anti-Catholic bigotry because they at first appeared to pass over a
priest in favor of a Protestant for the post.
</P>
<P>
   Even some GOP aides are viewing Tuesday's events as an
embarrassing blunder by the RNC.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Coughlin said he did not know the GOP had
organized the evening and ''just thought it was a Catholic group''
that was behind it.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he felt it was inappropriate for a political party to
honor him given the partisan nature of the selection process, the
Chicago priest said: ''Anything that seems partisan -- yes. I hope
for another invitation'' from other groups.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Coughlin said politics had nothing to do with his
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think some people think there are political overtones to my
being here,'' Coughlin told a group of about 200 gathered in the
basement of St. Peter's Church near the Capitol. ''There is not.''
</P>
<P>
   RNC Chairman Jim Nicholson said it was possible Coughlin did not
know Republicans organized the events, because they were put
together by the former ambassador to the Vatican, Thomas Melady.
Melady heads the RNC's Catholic Task Force, an effort to draw
Catholic voters into the party.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson insisted the events were intended not to score
political points, but merely to introduce Coughlin to lawmakers he
will be counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can anybody politicize the celebration of a Mass?''
Nicholson told a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Only 26 House Republicans who are on the RNC task force were
issued personal invitations to the event, along with other
prominent Republican Catholics, said RNC spokesman Chris Paulitz.
All other House members of both parties were just sent advisories
alerting them.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of House members attended, most Republican.
However, Coughlin said he had been ''approached by a couple people
who identified themselves as part of the minority party.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his new job has kept him extremely busy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I find it somewhat disarming to be on regular prayer on
C-Span,'' the slight, unassuming man said to laughter.
</P>
<P>
   He talked of being in awe of his grand new everyday surroundings
-- ''Walking through the hallways -- I hope I never lose that'' -- and
of feeling ''the weight of history.''
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin said scores of delighted Catholics have written to him.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has made Catholics around the country very, very happy
and very proud,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and other Republican
leaders came under fire late last year when they announced the
selection of the Rev. Charles Wright for the chaplain job.
Democrats insisted that a Catholic priest, the Rev. Timothy
O'Brien, was the top choice of a bipartisan selection committee.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker vehemently denied their characterizations of
anti-Catholic bias and after Wright eventually withdrew, Hastert
unexpectedly appointed Coughlin.

<HEADLINE> Plan to reunite Elian Gonzalez, father on hold  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A government plan to reunite Elian Gonzalez
with his father at a Miami-area airport Thursday is on hold as
officials wait to see whether the boy's Miami relatives and his
father can arrange an exchange of their own, a government official
said.
</P>
<P>
   A Cuban exile group had told a Capitol Hill news conference
yesterday night Elian's Miami relatives would bring the 6-year-old
shipwreck survivor to Washington for a meeting with his father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, at noon today.
</P>
<P>
   But shortly before midnight, Lazaro Gonzalez, the great-uncle
who has been caring for Elian since he was rescued off the Florida
coast in November, emerged from his house in Miami and said the
meeting was off.
</P>
<P>
   He said Elian did not want to go to Washington, so no one from
the Miami family would go. A crowd outside erupted with cheers.
</P>
<P>
   A government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the Justice Department was still trying to confirm such a meeting
would take place. An attorney for the boy's father also would not
comment on the initial reports of a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service,
Maria Cardona, said efforts had been under way late Tuesday and
were continuing early today to arrange a meeting of the families.
</P>
<P>
   ''While no meeting is yet officially confirmed, we continue to
focus on trying to get all of Elian's family to communicate and are
trying to resolve this promptly and cooperatively,'' Cardona said.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department official said the talks were continuing
into the early hours today. But with the situation in flux,
Attorney General Janet Reno last night postponed a trip to Miami
she had planned for today.
</P>
<P>
   A government official yesterday said a Justice Department letter
to Elian's Miami relatives had been drafted and proposed they
transfer Elian at Opa Locka airport, near Miami, on Thursday. That
letter has not been sent and is on hold, pending developments in
Washington, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Mas Santos, chairman of the Cuban American National
Foundation, told reporters last night that Lazaro Gonzalez would
bring the boy to Washington for the long-awaited reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Mas said the meeting would be closed to all non-family members,
but that Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder and Sen. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J., would be just outside. He said the meeting
would occur at noon at a place yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
   ''After four and a half months, the private meeting that this
family has so yearned for with Juan Miguel Gonzalez tomorrow will
be a reality,'' Mas said. He said the family and the Justice
Department had both agreed to the details.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be at a neutral site, and there's basically
going to be a resolution of the situation,'' Jose Cardenas,
Washington director the Cuban exile group, told The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli did not attend the news conference, and his
spokesman, Richard McGrath, would only confirm the senator was
involved in the negotiations to bring the boy to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear late Tuesday to whom Elian would be transferred
Thursday under the government plan, but it would be either to Juan
Miguel if he goes to Opa Locka, or to another of Elian's
great-uncles, Manolo Gonzalez. The great-uncle would then fly with
the boy to another location to meet the father.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no meeting of the family in Washington today, the
government then would go ahead and send the letter. It was because
of the reports of a meeting that Reno postponed her plan to go to
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Another source familiar with the ongoing discussions said Juan
Miguel's attorney, Greg Craig, had said the father was willing to
meet with the Miami family, but only if the boy was transferred to
him before that.
</P>
<P>
   Craig met for two hours Tuesday afternoon with Reno and Holder,
and met the father Tuesday night at the home of Cuban diplomat
outside Washington. Craig left the house near midnight and refused
to answer questions shouted at him about the reported meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The source said the plan was for the Miami relatives to meet at
noon in Washington with Juan Miguel with no lawyers or government
officials in the room, but the source said Holder and Torricelli
were supposed to be on hand in the same building.
</P>
<P>
   This source noted that when the plan was announced Tuesday
evening, there was no mention of transferring Elian to Juan Miguel.
The source was unable to say whether this was because no transfer
was planned or because the Miami relatives and their allies did not
want to announce a transfer agreement until after they left Miami.

<HEADLINE> Low-Power Radio Plan Defended  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- If you ask the commercial broadcasters gathered
here what the buzz is at their annual meeting, they are likely to
respond that it's not a buzz at all but the sound of interference --
exactly what they claim consumers will hear if hundreds of
low-power stations are allowed to go on the air.
</P>
<P>
   The showdown between the industry and federal regulators -- who
authorized the creation of a low-power service for community
groups, churches and others earlier this year -- is far from over.
And despite repeated promises by the Federal Communication
Commission that existing FM stations won't be hurt by the new
stations -- which cover only several miles -- broadcasters remain
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Young, who operates an AM and FM station in Napa Valley,
40 miles outside of San Francisco, said some broadcasters are leery
because of bad experiences with pirate radio. Even though the FCC
has set restrictions on who is eligible for the stations, ''we of
course are nervous about what it means.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, FCC Chairman Bill Kennard sought to assure the
broadcasters here, but also chided the industry for trying to
derail the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why in the midst of all this opportunity for broadcasters have
you chosen to muster your considerable resources in Washington and
around the country to deny churches and schools and community-based
organizations just a little piece of the broadcast pie?'' Kennard
said.
</P>
<P>
   He questioned why the group had ''squandered its goodwill at the
FCC'' in its battle against low-power.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwill works both ways, said National Association of
Broadcasters president Edward Fritts after Kennard's address.
</P>
<P>
   And turning to Congress for a tiebreak, ''might be the way to
resolve the interference issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislation that would severely curtail the number of low-power
stations the FCC could license already is winding through the
House. Floor action could come this week.
</P>
<P>
   The bill boosts the interference protections between neighboring
channels from what the FCC had authorized and requires the
commission to set up an experimental program in nine markets to see
what would happen if those protections were relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   FCC officials have asserted that they took a conservative
approach in deciding to create the low-power service, and that they
provided ample protection to existing stations. They also say that
increasing the buffers between stations means that there would be
up to two-thirds fewer stations licensed. A market like
Indianapolis would have had nine stations under the commission
plan, but none under the legislation, according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
   But the measure has drawn the backing of some surprising allies,
like National Public Radio. Because most public radio stations are
more tightly packed together and have restrictions on their power
level, they are more vulnerable to interference, said NPR president
Kevin Klose. The group also is concerned that the low-power
stations might interfere with reading services for the blind that
are carried on subcarrier channels.
</P>
<P>
   On another matter, Kennard warned broadcasters against trying to
push off the deadline for moving from analog to digital TV, which
stations must complete by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   ''Delay is simply not an option,'' Kennard told the group
Tuesday. The transition ''will happen as sure as day follows
night.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fritts said broadcasters are making investments to upgrade
their stations to digital without any assurances that their digital
signals will be carried by cable companies on those systems or that
the quality of digital TV sets on the market will improve.

<HEADLINE> Clinton in Denver on Gun Campaign  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Although President Clinton asked Congress to
pass new gun laws before the first anniversary of the killings at
Columbine High School, the White House acknowledges the deadline
will slip.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was to complain about Congress and the gun lobby today
while urging voters in Colorado to take their own steps for gun
control. A week before the April 20 Columbine anniversary, Clinton
was endorsing a state ballot measure that would impose new
requirements for buyers at Colorado gun shows, as Clinton wants to
do nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also planned to participate in a Denver town hall
gathering on guns.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Gov. Bill Owens supports the initiative but did not
plan to attend today's rally. He said of Clinton: ''I do hope that
he doesn't politicize a Colorado issue, and get involved in
something that ought to be up to Coloradans to vote and agree on,''
Owens said.
</P>
<P>
   Two teen-age gunmen were among 15 dead at Columbine, in the
Denver suburb of Littleton. Clinton has frequently invoked the
killings as he argues for what he calls ''commonsense gun laws''
that include background checks for buyers at gun shows. The killers
got weapons from an acquaintance who easily bought them at a flea
market-style gun show.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado initiative is sponsored by Sane Alternative to the
Firearms Epidemic, a group formed after Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   It would require a background check before a vendor could sell a
gun at a gun show, with criminal misdemeanor penalties for
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Under current federal law, unlicensed dealers may sell weapons
in private transactions without subjecting the purchasers to a
background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would attend the SAFE rally after his own bill
became mired on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   A House-Senate conference committee has been assigned to
reconcile differences between a Senate-passed bill that would set a
72-hour background check on gun show sales and a House bill that
shrank the wait to 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The committee has met only once, in August, which the White
House attributes to political maneuvering by the National Rifle
Association.
</P>
<P>
   As the Columbine anniversary approached, White House aides
acknowledged this week that there is no chance of a national gun
show bill before April 20.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado visit is Clinton's second foray in two days to
promote gun control. On Tuesday he stood by as Maryland Gov. Parris
Glendening signed a law making that state the first to require
built-in locks on handguns while imposing other stringent
gun-control rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every single day Congress waits, we lose 12 children, nearly
90 people overall, to gun violence,'' Clinton said Tuesday in the
Maryland capital of Annapolis. ''Congress should follow Maryland's
lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress, however, was busy passing the Project Exile Act, a
$100 million package of financial incentives for states that set
mandatory sentences of five years without parole for criminals who
use or carry guns. The House approved the bill on a 358-60 vote --
to the delight of the National Rifle Association, which has accused
the Clinton administration of lax gun law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have Governor Glendening and President Clinton basically
engaging in political theater for the cameras, while the House of
Representatives was about the business of (serious) public
policy,'' said NRA chief lobbyist James J. Baker.

<HEADLINE> Rep. Kennedy Denies Guard's Claim  </HEADLINE>
By RACHEL ZOLL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Rep. Patrick Kennedy disputes a security
guard's claim that he grabbed and shoved her at Los Angeles
International Airport last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''When all the facts become public, people will see that the
press reports don't reflect what actually happened,'' Kennedy said
in a brief statement Tuesday night. ''I apologized for this
unfortunate incident at the time and continue to regret that it
occurred. I sincerely hope that this matter can be resolved soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Della Patton, 58, said Kennedy grabbed and pushed her the night
of March 26, after she told him his bag was too big to fit through
an X-ray scanner.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman, son of Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., then
allegedly grabbed Patton's arm and cursed at her while ordering her
out of the way. Patton complained of injuries to her left shoulder.
She filed a battery complaint with police on or about April 1.
</P>
<P>
   No charges have been filed against Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Patton, reached at her home Tuesday, said she was in pain but
declined further comment. She referred calls to her attorney, Paul
Trump, who did not return calls.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives have reviewed a surveillance video of the incident,
but have not made it public.
</P>
<P>
   ''It shows there appears to have been physical contact between
Ms. Patton and Mr. Kennedy,'' Los Angeles police Lt. Horace Frank
said. ''She said she was battered at a preboard checkpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for both sides met with detectives Tuesday. Kennedy's
chief of staff, Tony Marcella, said Patton's attorney has
approached them hoping for a settlement. Marcella would not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Police have not forwarded the case to the city attorney, whose
office would determine whether to file charges against Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   William Lynch, chairman of the Rhode Island Democratic Party,
accused Patton of distorting the facts to profit at the
congressman's expense.
</P>
<P>
   ''She started to look at this thing and heard cash register
sounds in her head,'' said Lynch, who said he discussed the
incident with Kennedy two days ago.
</P>
<P>
   He said Kennedy had some ''inadvertent contact'' with Patton but
he did not grab or shove her, as she claims.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's resigned to the fact that because his name is Kennedy,
these types of things that ordinarily wouldn't mean anything are
totally blown out of proportion,'' Lynch said Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down72.56; Dow Up 99.05  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed at the start of trading today.
Technology shares came under pressure after a Goldman Sachs analyst
lowered his estimate for Microsoft's revenue in the last quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 99.05 at 11,386.13.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index
was down 72.56 at 3,983.34, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
up 1.25 at 1,501.84.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft fell 3 11/64 to 80 45/64. This morning, Goldman Sachs
analyst Rick Sherlund cut his revenue estimate for the company's
fiscal third quarter to $5.75 billion from $5.95 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sherlund said in a research note that personal computer sales
during the quarter appear to have missed Goldman Sachs's earlier
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a further negative for sentiment in a poor tech
market,'' Sherlund said. Computer makers slumped on the news; Dell
fell 2[ to 53 5/16 and IBM fell 2 11/16 to 116 7/16 on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Sherlund maintained his third-quarter earnings estimate on
Microsoft of 41 cents a share, compared with 35 cents a year ago,
noting that the lower revenue would likely be offset by gains in
the investment portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan rose 5 9/16 to 140 5/16, buoying the Dow. The
investment bank easily exceeded Wall Street's earnings estimates,
posting first-quarter profits of $3.37 a share. Analysts surveyed
by First Call/Thomson Financial had anticipated earnings of $2.81 a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 130.29 million
shares, behind Tuesday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.73 to 508.40.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.5 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.3 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.2 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up
0.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Uranium Workers To Be Compensated  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, acknowledging that
thousands of people became seriously ill, is unveiling a broad
package of compensation today for ailing workers who were exposed
to radiation at the country's nuclear bomb factories during the
Cold War, government sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson was to announce the
compensation program, most of which will still have to be approved
by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would offer lump-sum payments of at least $100,000 to
workers or their survivors, or allow them to negotiate a package
that would cover medical costs, lost wages and job retraining,
according to sources familiar with the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   While it's unclear how many people would be affected, the Energy
Department has estimated that about 3,000 former workers at nuclear
weapons plants, or their families, are likely to be eligible
because of exposure to radiation in the 1950s and, in some cases
into the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The plan estimates the cost of the program at as much as $400
million a year in the early years, but costs would decline as the
number of eligible workers declines, said officials.
</P>
<P>
   The plan represents the first action by the government that
would affect long-standing claims by nuclear-weapons workers
throughout the government's vast nuclear weapons production complex
covering facilities in more than a dozen states.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear what specific facilities would be
covered, although workers at uranium enrichment plants in Paducah,
Ky., and Piketon, Ohio are among the locations where compensation
was expected.
</P>
<P>
   Last January, a White House panel concluded there was credible
evidence that many workers at the nuclear weapons plants became ill
with lung cancer and other serious illnesses because of exposure to
radiation or toxic chemicals. Until then, the government had always
denied a direct link between work exposure and later illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal being unveiled today, the government would
assume workers were exposed to the highest expected level of
radiation associated with their work if actual medical records were
not available, said the sources, who spoke on condition of not
being further identified.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed compensation plan, which was put together by the
White House National Economic Council, was first reported by The
Washington Post and The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   The plan expands an earlier proposal by the Energy Department
that would provide compensation to a limited number of workers who
have contracted an incurable beryllium disease because of exposure
to chemicals and radioactive material at the Kentucky and Ohio
uranium enrichment plants.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government is done fighting workers and now we're going to
help them. We're reversing the decades-old practice of opposing
worker claims and moving forward to do the right thing,''
Richardson was quoted as saying by the Post.
</P>
<P>
   The findings last January that illnesses were linked to nuclear
weapons work was based on a review of dozens of studies and raw
medical data covering an estimated 600,000 workers at 14 nuclear
weapons sites.
</P>
<P>
   While the panel said the evidence did not in all cases show a
direct causal link between workplace exposures and specific
illnesses, it found that workers at the plants suffered higher than
normal rates of a wide range of cancers and that they clearly were
exposed to cancer-causing radiation and chemicals in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   The studies examined health records and other data covering
three decades of the Cold War, and officials emphasized the
findings do not relate to working conditions at the plants today.
</P>
<P>
   The report said elevated rates of 22 categories of cancer were
found among workers at 14 facilities in the department's atomic
weapons complex. They included leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma and
cancers of the prostate, kidney, salivary gland and lung.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton ordered the review after the Energy Department
concluded the government should compensate workers who had
developed an incurable lung disease because of exposure to
beryllium, a material used in nuclear weapons production.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson and the White House wanted to determine if other
nuclear weapons plant workers likewise should be compensated
because of exposure to plutonium, uranium and a variety of
radioactive or highly toxic substances. The interagency group
reviewed dozens of epidemiological studies, raw health data and
other documents, many of which in the past have been dismissed by
the government.
</P>
<P>
   The report's findings included workers at plutonium production
facilities at Savannah River in South Carolina and Hanford in
Washington state; the Rocky Flats plant near Denver, where
plutonium was molded into weapons components; uranium enrichment
and processing plants at the Oak Ridge, Tenn., complex; the Fernald
uranium processing plant near Cincinnati; and the Lawrence
Livermore and Los Alamos national laboratories in California and
New Mexico, respectively.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Bill Backing Gun Laws  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans followed through on their
promise to strengthen gun enforcement with a bill rewarding states
that impose tough mandatory minimum sentences on gun-toting
criminals. Democrats urged them to go a step further and support
tough gun safety legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The House, by 358-60, on Tuesday passed the ''Project Exile
Act'' that provides $100 million over five years in grants for
states that sentence people who use or carry firearms during a
violent crime or serious drug trafficking offense to at least five
years in prison without parole.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which still requires Senate action, echoes the GOP
theme that the answer to the nation's gun violence problem is not
more gun laws but better enforcement of laws already on the books.
The National Rifle Association, which has criticized the
administration for not adequately prosecuting gun violators, is an
ardent supporter of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, and most Democrats, went along with the bill
but said it provided too little money to make a difference and gave
political cover to Republicans resisting more comprehensive gun
control measures.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen moderate Republicans joined in today with a letter to
the White House and GOP leaders stating that the time has come for
action on more far-reaching gun legislation. ''A failure to pass
the limited, common-sense reforms now under consideration is simply
unacceptable to most Americans,'' wrote Rep. Michael Castle, R-Del.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, seeking to move the gun safety debate outside
Washington, on Tuesday attended a ceremony in Maryland for the
first state law requiring built-in gun locks. He travels to
Colorado today to back an initiative requiring background checks
for gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every single day Congress waits, we lose 12 children, nearly
90 people overall, to gun violence. Congress should follow
Maryland's lead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is modeled after a mandatory minimum sentencing program
initiated by the Justice Department in Richmond, Va., once one of
the nation's most crime-ridden cities. Since its implementation in
1997 crimes involving guns have dropped by 65 percent and violent
crimes by 35 percent, although skeptics have pointed out that crime
rates in other Virginia cities without the program dropped by
similar rates.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., the chief sponsor, said the bill
sends ''gun wielding criminals an unmistakable message'' that gun
crimes won't be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia last year passed a statewide ''Project Exile'' bill,
making it one of six states, with Texas, Florida, Louisiana, South
Carolina and Colorado, that would qualify for funds under the
McCollum bill. The money can be used to defray costs associated
with tougher enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the bigger issue was the failure of Congress to
pass gun control measures introduced after the shootings at
Columbine High School in Colorado a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, top Democrat on the Judiciary
Committee, said the bill ''parrots the NRA line that we can't close
the gun enforcement loopholes in the law that allow criminals to
rearm.''
</P>
<P>
   He complained that he couldn't get a vote on a bill he is
sponsoring with Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., that would authorize
$150 million next year to hire 1,000 state and local gun
prosecutors, $53 million for 600 special agents and inspectors, $70
million to improve national instant criminal background checks and
$38 million to improve gun tracing and ballistic testing.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has proposed spending $280 million next year to
boost firearms enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Some bipartisanship was shown at the end of the day when the
House voted 406-22 on a nonbinding resolution stating that
House-Senate negotiators for a long-stalled gun control bill should
agree to both effective gun law enforcement and common-sense gun
safety measures.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which has languished since last summer, would promote
child safety locks, ban the importation of high-capacity ammunition
clips, bar juvenile possession of assault weapons, and prohibit
youths with criminal records from possessing handguns. The main
stumbling block has been how to define background checks for gun
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Conyers and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., agreed during floor debate to work on that remaining issue.
''We could have the makings of a decent gun bill,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is H.R. 4051.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Probing Kaiser Permanente  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- State regulators are investigating
complaints that Kaiser Permanente requires psychiatrists to
prescribe depression and anxiety medications for patients they
haven't examined.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations are being investigated by the state Department
of Corporations, the Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday, and stem
from a lawsuit filed Monday by a former Kaiser psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas S. Jensen of San Diego has accused the health
maintenance organization of firing him for refusing to prescribe
medicine for patients he did not personally examine. He asked the
court to halt Kaiser's policy on such prescriptions, which are
often delivered at the behest of social workers or family
therapists.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say prescriptions from absentee psychiatrists endanger
patients, threaten the public and violate the American Psychiatric
Association's codes of ethics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was trained that you don't prescribe medicines for patients
you've never seen,'' Jensen said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser acknowledged its policy differs from standards generally
accepted by the psychiatric community. The company has 30 days to
answer the allegations in Jensen's lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dennis Cook, coordinating chief of psychiatrists for
Kaiser's Southern California operations, said the policy allows
Kaiser psychiatrists to treat more patients.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think it's very ethical,'' said Cook, who added that no
injuries have resulted from Kaiser's medication policy.
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatrists can refuse to prescribe drugs if the case does not
seem to warrant it, Cook said. However, they must agree in
principle to prescribe drugs without examining patients if the HMO
believes there is an obvious prescriptive solution to a patient's
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Patients are also given follow-up appointments with a
psychiatrist about three weeks later and instructed to phone Kaiser
if any side effects develop, Cook added. People with severe
psychiatric or psychological conditions must see a psychiatrist
before medication is prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser is the nation's largest not-for-profit health maintenance
organization, serving 8 million members in 11 states and the
District of Columbia. Almost 6 million of its patients are in
California.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 168.42; Dow Up 56.46  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks fell sharply for a third
straight session today after a Goldman Sachs analyst lowered his
estimate for Microsoft's revenue in the last quarter. Blue-chip
shares rose after a strong earnings report from J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index
was down 168.42 at 3,887.48. The index had dipped more than 200
points lower.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Dow Jones industrial
average was up 56.46 at 11,343.54, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 9.81 at 1,490.78.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft fell 4] to 79{. This morning, Goldman Sachs analyst
Rick Sherlund cut his revenue estimate for the company's fiscal
third quarter to $5.75 billion from $5.95 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sherlund said in a research note that personal computer sales
during the quarter appear to have missed Goldman Sachs's earlier
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a further negative for sentiment in a poor tech
market,'' Sherlund said. Computer makers slumped on the news; Dell
fell 2| to 52 13/16 and IBM fell 2 11/16 to 116 7/16 on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Sherlund maintained his third-quarter earnings estimate on
Microsoft of 41 cents a share, compared with 35 cents a year ago,
noting that the lower revenue would likely be offset by gains in
the investment portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's slide provided the latest catalyst for the ongoing
decline of the Nasdaq. The index, which set a closing record of
5,048.62 on March 10, has tumbled 23 percent since then, and is now
down 4.7 percent in the year to date.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's decline picked up steam last week, when the index
fell more than 400 points over the course of two wildly volatile
sessions. Now, analysts are divided on whether the index is headed
back toward its low point of about 3,650 or poised for a round of
bargain-hunting.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, analysts say, the volatile action has brought
some welcome skepticism to the technology market.
</P>
<P>
   ''Investors will be more discriminating in their buying of
technology and Internet stocks,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, chief
market strategist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan rose 3 5/16 to 138 1/16, buoying the Dow. The
investment bank easily exceeded Wall Street's earnings estimates,
posting first-quarter profits of $3.37 a share. Analysts surveyed
by First Call/Thomson Financial had anticipated earnings of $2.81 a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-5 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 338.99 million
shares, behind Tuesday's pace.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ink Painting Exhibit Compelling  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN AFFLECK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- The interplay of dark and light, pictures and
words. The portrayal of simple subjects, expressing a religious
path to enlightenment: birds, mountains, scholars.
</P>
<P>
   These elements fascinated artists in the Far East hundreds of
years ago and tie together a subtle but compelling new exhibit at
the Cleveland Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition of 33 pieces titled ''Ink Paintings and
Ash-Glazed Ceramics: Medieval Calligraphy, Painting and Ceramic Art
From Japan and Korea'' runs through May 28 and will appear only in
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   It's made up of 33 paintings and ceramic pieces from the private
collection of George Gund III, a businessman, philanthropist and
vice chairman of the Cleveland Cavaliers pro basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   The works date from the 14th century to the 17th century. They
don't represent a comprehensive artistic history of the period --
they're not meant to -- but they give the viewer a taste of themes
and techniques of the time, along with a few glimpses of the work
of famous artists.
</P>
<P>
   ''The paintings and calligraphy in this exhibition share two
fundamental characteristics: the imagery arises from a brush laden
with ink; and the ideas behind the imagery originate in Buddhist
religious thought,'' Michael R. Cunningham, the museum's curator of
Japanese and Korean art writes in his introduction to the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   To an eye more familiar with Western painting from the same era
-- the age in which Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci lived -- the
ink paintings seem austere.
</P>
<P>
   The scrolls on which the works are painted are weathered. The
tones of ink paintings, or suibokuga, are shades of gray and black.
</P>
<P>
   But the viewer quickly notices the fine brush work, which sets
off contrasts between light and dark, the love of nature that runs
through the work, and the beauty of the calligraphy that adds
artistic balance to the picture itself and carries a message to
complement the work.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit also covers the period when ink painting gained
popularity in Japan, inspired by an influx of works from Chinese
Buddhist monks.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest piece in the collection is ''Geese in a Landscape,''
an anonymous painting with calligraphy by Issan Ichinei, a Chinese
monk sent to Japan as an unofficial emissary in 1299.
</P>
<P>
   The painting is simple, with an almost coarse quality in the
bands of ink which create a slanting sandbar at the bottom of the
hanging scroll.
</P>
<P>
   Three geese stand together on the sandbar in wonderfully
natural, almost vulnerable, poses: one with its neck raised to
honk, another preening, the third dipping its head toward the
water.
</P>
<P>
   The monk's calligraphy, meanwhile, in the middle right of the
work provides a counterweight to the geese, framed on the left by a
slim reed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here's an inscription that really talks to the painted image
and vice versa,'' Cunningham said on a recent tour of the exhibit.
''It's this kind of painting that begins to develop in the 14th
century in Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Together, the inscriptions and paintings could be used as tools
to bring enlightenment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A tougher natural image comes from another bird painting, ''Hawk
on a Tree Branch.'' It was done by Toki Tomikage, a samurai, who
celebrated the bird of prey's strength by putting it near the
center of the painting, feathers puffed out against high winds as
it perches on a dead branch.
</P>
<P>
   Again, lines of calligraphy provide visual balance and a verse
that begins with this image: ''It is a quiet place with a dead tree
and a cold rock. A majestic hawk is perched there, its thoughts far
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights of the exhibit are four works by Ikkyu
Sojun, a brilliant and eccentric Zen monk who lived in the 15th
century. The unacknowledged son of an emperor, he was essentially
abandoned at a temple as a child to be raised there.
</P>
<P>
   A passionate man with deep religious convictions, Ikkyu grew
into a harsh critic of Zen monastic institutions, accusing them of
being corrupt. He was unafraid to openly defy Zen authorities and
conventions by frequenting big city inns and brothels.
</P>
<P>
   Ikkyu's vigor is captured in a gorgeous piece of calligraphy
called ''Reflections of Priest Foyen.'' Unlike many of the delicate
inscriptions in the exhibit, Ikkyu's characters are bold and
striking, as is the verse itself. The poet declares ''Life is a
mirage,'' and later says, ''Be it movement or stillness, coldness
or warmth. One's own shame and regret come from such delusions.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most accessible works in the exhibit are several
ceramics from Japan. The vessels, originally made for everyday use,
have a natural ash glaze that helped seal them and gave them an
attractive finish.
</P>
<P>
   They began to be collected as art objects in the 18th century
and, with their use of rough and simple decoration, would be at
home in a modern art fair.
</P>
<P>
   But like their ink painting counterparts, they reveal an
appreciation of natural beauty that flowered in medieval Japan.

<HEADLINE> Esther Williams Still Buoyant at 77  </HEADLINE>
By BOB THOMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- The comedian Fanny Brice once
cracked about Esther Williams: ''Wet she's a star, dry she ain't.''
</P>
<P>
   The comment was to haunt Williams throughout her movie career.
Even though her underwater extravaganzas enriched her and MGM, one
ambition would continually elude her.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to do a 'dry' movie,'' she recalls. ''I went to
(studio executive) Benny Thau and said, 'I would love to play in
''Cass Timberlane'' with Spencer Tracy; to act with someone of
Tracy's stature would be my dream. I can't spend my career with
Johnny Johnston and Peter Lawford.'
</P>
<P>
   ''And Benny told me: 'Esther, wet you're a star.'''
</P>
<P>
   For a dozen years in 16 aquatic-musicals, Williams sold millions
of movie tickets. Originally hired as MGM's answer to 20th Century
Fox's Sonja Henie, she eclipsed the skating queen in fame and
longevity. She proudly claims to have inspired a new Olympic sport
-- synchronized swimming, which was introduced in the 1984 Los
Angeles games.
</P>
<P>
   At 77, Williams' face is wider, her broad-shouldered body
heftier than in her bathing beauty days. But she retains the same
zest she exhibited in her movies.
</P>
<P>
   She continues with her line of swimsuits, in myriad patterns and
styles. She has her own Web site, designed by her computer whiz
son, Kim Gage, so she can keep in touch with fans. She tours the
lecture circuit discussing her life and career. She is tireless in
promoting her tell-all autobiography, ''Million Dollar Mermaid,''
which aroused a noisy reaction when published last September.
</P>
<P>
   Williams lives with her fourth husband, Edward Bell, a former
college professor and actor, now her business manager, in a
hillside house above Los Angeles' Coldwater Canyon. You can tell
it's a pricy neighborhood. Microsoft billionaire Paul Allen tore
down Rock Hudson's old house next door and is building his own
palace.
</P>
<P>
   The Williams-Bell house is traditionally furnished with
overstuffed couches, a crystal chandelier over the grand piano. The
clutter of photographs in a bookcase are mostly of Williams'
children (Benjie, Susan, Kim) and grandchildren. No sign of her
first three husbands.
</P>
<P>
   Of course there's a swimming pool, one with an underwater
machine that simulates a river current. More exercise that way.
</P>
<P>
   As a nonstop talker, Williams ranks with her friend Debbie
Reynolds (they once planned a TV talk show together but dropped the
idea). She is -- has always been -- frank, sparing no one, including
herself.
</P>
<P>
   She also is unfailingly optimistic. Did that evolve from a happy
childhood?
</P>
<P>
   ''Not particularly,'' she says. ''After I was born, my mother
told my sister Maureen: 'This is the fifth one; you take her. I
don't want to raise any more kids, I want to get out in the world
and see what's going on.'
</P>
<P>
   ''My mother was ahead of her times. She was a psychologist when
there weren't many women psychologists. She got out of the house by
handing me over to Maureen. Maureen was a wonderful sister; she
taught me how to swim ...
</P>
<P>
   ''My father was so in love with my mother that he didn't care
what happened to his five kids. When we'd go to Daddy with a
problem, he'd say, 'Go talk to your mother; she has all the
answers.'
</P>
<P>
   ''A happy childhood? I made it happy because of my swimming.''
</P>
<P>
   Her swimming progressed from neighborhood public pools in Los
Angeles to training at the L.A. Athletic Club to a national
championship in the 100-meter freestyle, then three berths on the
1940 Olympics team. When the games were canceled because of World
War II, she sold and modeled clothes at I. Magnin's department
store.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year-old's first taste of show business came when Billy
Rose cast her to star with Johnny Weissmuller in the Aquacade at
San Francisco's Pan-Pacific Exposition. That attracted the
attention of MGM, which brought her to Culver City for a screen
test.
</P>
<P>
   She started the test with a young contract player, Dan Dailey.
Then the King himself, Clark Gable, strode onto the stage,
accompanied by his wife, Carole Lombard. He insisted on doing the
test with the dazed Williams, and he included three kisses. Then he
walked off, saying to Lombard, ''Well, baby, I told you I was gonna
kiss me a mermaid today.''
</P>
<P>
   After her debut in an Andy Hardy picture and a bit in ''A Guy
Named Joe,'' Williams made her big splash in ''Bathing Beauty,'' a
huge success. She would be spending much of the next decade in the
tank the studio built for her on Stage 30.
</P>
<P>
   Being the world's No. 1 mermaid had its hazards. She almost
drowned in an underwater scene when a set worker accidentally
closed off her only exit.
</P>
<P>
   And there was the matter of her co-stars.
</P>
<P>
   ''Van Johnson, who made five pictures with me, didn't know how
to swim,'' she recalls. ''So I had to teach him, and in some of the
scenes I held him up with my hand under his back. Ricardo Montalban
was working out at a gym, and he wasn't buoyant. While I swam, he
was walking on a plank. People with dense muscles have trouble
swimming; I'll bet Arnold Schwarzenegger has that problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunate in her career, Williams had less luck with husbands.
</P>
<P>
   She was not yet 18 in 1940 when she took time between Aquacade
shows to marry a handsome young medical student, Leonard Kovner.
The marriage was idyllic until MGM made her a contract offer. He
was opposed to her becoming an actress. He also refused to consider
having children. When he became physically abusive, she says, she
fled their tiny honeymoon home. A divorce followed.
</P>
<P>
   On the rebound, she fell for handsome, 6-foot-6 soldier Ben
Gage, who had been a band singer and Bob Hope's radio announcer.
They married after his discharge in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage produced three children, a partnership in a
restaurant and other ventures -- and mismanagement of Williams'
money affairs. Outwardly it seemed a perfect match: the tall,
smiling Gage and everyone's favorite mermaid. But there was private
conflict because of his drinking, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't know that he would have a few drinks before we went
out together,'' she says, citing one gala dinner at the Beverly
Hills Hotel when Gage passed out and slid under the table.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was when I began my friendship with Fernando (Lamas),''
Williams said. ''He took me on the dance floor and said, 'You wanna
get him out of here; it's going to take some logistics.' It took
six waiters to remove him. Fortunately, this was before the
tabloids, so nobody took any pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams kept the marriage going as long as she could because of
the children. But she won a divorce in 1959, telling the judge:
''Your honor, I'm really tired of being what my husband does for a
living.'' He had managed to leave her $750,000 in debt to the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Lamas had first impressed Williams when he was cast
opposite her in ''Dangerous When Wet.'' A former swimming champion
in Buenos Aires, he was her only costar to be an expert swimmer.
Their romance began after her second divorce and the end of his
tempestuous affair with Lana Turner. The marriage to Williams in
1969 was his fourth.
</P>
<P>
   As a husband, Lamas turned out to be funny, charming,
over-sexed, unpredictable and imperious. He demanded that she
abandon her career and devote herself to him. She agreed -- her
career was on the wane, anyway -- with the proviso that he cease his
lifelong pursuit of women.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage took a toll on Williams' relationship with her
three children.
</P>
<P>
   ''His reasoning was: 'I love little babies. But as soon as they
have an opinion, I want to get rid of them and let 'em live with
somebody else,''' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ''His own tortured childhood made him want no other child to
have it any better. His father died when he was 1, his mother when
he was 4. Because of the paternal nature of Argentina, he was put
in the care of the paternal grandmother, who was, I believe,
certifiably insane.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamas limited her contacts with Benjie, Susan and Kim, and she
now calls him ''an overbearing dictator -- I think he was schooled
with Peron.'' Yet she stayed with him for 22 years and nursed him
through lymphoma until his death in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have developed a philosophy about why movie stars have such
a hard time having a happy marriage,'' Williams says. ''It's
because your No. 1 thought is how to do your job. The job is so
compelling and so draining, because you have all kinds of chances
of failing; the failure element is always looming.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need men under the wrong circumstances; things can't take a
natural evolution. You have a man who is slightly hypnotized by who
you are -- and maybe not slightly, but a lot. You're trying to find
the real one, and you're never presented with the real one.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams thought she had found the real one in Jeff Chandler,
with whom she starred in ''Raw Wind in Eden'' after she left MGM.
Her account of discovering that he was a cross-dresser proved to be
the most controversial part of her autobiography. Chandler's
friends and fans assailed her, claiming the late actor had no such
tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   She sticks to her story:
</P>
<P>
   ''We went together for three years. If he had this aberration of
cross-dressing and it would be part of the marriage contract, I
would have to hear about that on the second date, not three years
later when we're very involved with each other.
</P>
<P>
   ''The children loved him. What was I going to say to my two boys
and my daughter when their new daddy wanted to wear Mommy's
clothes?''
</P>
<P>
   Putting it in the book was a way of trying to understand it, she
says. ''Remember, in 1960, we didn't have all the psycho-babble of
today ...
</P>
<P>
   ''I loved Jeff. When I went up those stairs (in his house), I
did not know he was getting into flowered chiffon. I was going up
to tell him I would accept his marriage proposal. I've often felt
that when you've made your choice, life will offer you a visible
test of what it would be like. I've had several experiences where I
got to the edge of the cliff, then drew back. That happened with
Jeff.''

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: Dove Awards  </HEADLINE>
By JIM PATTERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Country cedes the spotlight to the
Christian music industry on April 20, when the 31st annual Dove
Awards will be presented at the Grand Ole Opry House. TV star
Kathie Lee Gifford will host the show.
</P>
<P>
   Gifford, co-host of ''Live With Regis &AMP; Kathie Lee,'' last
played the famous hall in the late 1970s as a cast member of ''Hee
Haw Honeys,'' a short-lived spinoff of ''Hee Haw.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was not what one would call a critical hit,'' Gifford said.
''However, it was a wonderful experience for me. It was my first
time working in Nashville.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gospel Music Association's Dove Awards give Christian music
the opportunity to reach for an audience outside its subculture, so
it will be firing its big guns for the syndicated show.
</P>
<P>
   Sixpence None the Richer, a Christian band that crossed over
with the pop hit ''Kiss Me,'' will debut its new single ''Melody of
You.'' Dolly Parton will join Gifford for ''Only My Pillow Knows,''
a duet from Gifford's new album ''Born for You.''
</P>
<P>
   Other stars include dc Talk, Steven Curtis Chapman, CeCe Winans
and Jaci Velasquez.
</P>
<P>
   For the mainstream audience, producers have booked Parton,
Alison Krauss and teen opera star Charlotte Church.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had been a member of the Gospel Music Association years ago
and had done several gospel albums years and years ago,'' said
Gifford, who is taking over hosting duties from John Tesh.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always loved gospel music, even though it wasn't the kind
of music I was making any more. I'd been away long enough, is
really what it came down to,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The show will be held on the first anniversary of the shootings
at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. Michael W. Smith, last
year's best new artist, will perform ''This Is Your Time,'' which
was inspired by the shootings. The song is nominated for song of
the year, pop-contemporary recorded song of the year and short-form
music video.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is also nominated for best artist, songwriter and male
vocalist.
</P>
<P>
   Other nominees for best artist are Chapman, Avalon, Point of
Grace and Sixpence None the Richer.
</P>
<P>
   Toby McKeehan of the trio dc Talk received the most nominations:
six individual and four with the group.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman has nine nominations, including best artist and male
vocalist.
</P>
<P>
   Sixpence None the Richer received three major nominations --
group of the year, artist of the year and Leigh Nash as female
vocalist of the year -- as well as special event album for
''Streams.''
</P>
<P>
   County music legend George Jones and Vestal Goodman are
nominated for the song ''Angel Band'' on the ''Vestal and Friends''
album in the country recorded song category. Bluegrass artist
Krauss is nominated in the same category for ''I Give You to His
Heart'' on ''The Prince of Egypt-Nashville'' album.
</P>
<P>
   And in the country album category, veteran performer Glen
Campbell is nominated for ''A Glen Campbell Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Gifford said she is happy that Christian singers have a national
showcase, even if it is just once a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have people like Michael W. (Smith), Sandi Patty and Kathy
Troccoli on our show quite often -- not often enough for my taste,''
said Gifford, who is leaving ''Live With Regis &AMP; Kathie Lee'' this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Dove Awards are nominated and selected by the 5,500 industry
workers who are members of the Gospel Music Association. The GMA
was formed in 1964 to promote the Christian music industry.

<HEADLINE> Magazine Spotlights Texas Music  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE MABIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Tex. (AP) -- Stewart Ramser couldn't believe the idea
hadn't been tried before: a high-quality magazine dedicated to the
multifarious music of the Lone Star State.
</P>
<P>
   The idea has become Ramser's reality.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Music made its national debut earlier this month, hitting
newsstands from California to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the things we want to do is cover all of the genres we
have, like Tejano. We have an article about a rap band from Fort
Worth in the second issue. We want to really be diverse. Texans
like to read about other Texans, regardless of their musical
tastes, I believe,'' Ramser said.
</P>
<P>
   Ramser got the idea for the magazine while he was on vacation in
Hawaii in 1998. He was relaxing on a beach when a radio station
began playing an entire set from Texas artists.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of a sudden, it just hit me. I had been out of the state
six-plus years and I missed a lot of great music, and there wasn't
really a place to turn to read about it,'' the Fort Worth native
said. ''There were great local papers and market-free weeklies, but
those aren't distributed outside of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rolling Stone or the other national publications would
occasionally cover Texas artists, but I knew that there was this
thing with Texas music that was very diverse and that a lot of
people were very passionate about. So it just hit me that I'm going
to write a business plan about a magazine and also tie in a Web
site.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramser -- neither a musician nor a journalist -- cashed out his
retirement plan, emptied his savings, borrowed from friends and
poured his soul into Texas Music.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 people subscribed to the first issue, released in
Texas and a handful of other states in January. Houston-born Lyle
Lovett was on the cover that sold more than 38,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   Ramser, who holds business degrees from the University of Texas
and UCLA, remembers the debut well.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were doing it all ourselves. We got into two stores Friday
afternoon. I told myself, 'I'm not going to go back and bug the
stores every day to see how my magazine's doing.' Sunday, I go back
to the two stores and they sold out immediately. They were like,
'Get us twice as many.'''
</P>
<P>
   Issue No. 2, featuring the Flatlanders, was distributed
nationwide and to more than 1,000 subscribers in 40 states. About
50 more subscribers a week are signing up, Ramser said, and
national advertisers are coming slowly but surely.
</P>
<P>
   The next national issue will be released in June.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Music is as diverse as the state itself. Topics range from
a behind-the-scenes look at ''Austin City Limits'' to a profile of
the Texas A&AMP;M University marching band. Big names with Texas ties
are scattered throughout the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Cosgrove of the music TV show ''Austin City Limits'' said
Texas is a great stage on which to shine a national spotlight
because of its diversity of artists.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there's any state that's worthy of a magazine that covers
music within its borders, it's Texas,'' Cosgrove said. ''Because of
the diversity of the state and the styles that have influenced
music that's happening today, I mean you can go down to the border
toward Mexico and you've got a story. You can go toward Louisiana
and you've got a story there. You can go to Lubbock and you've got
a story. ...
</P>
<P>
   ''It's almost like what we do, only it's on paper.''

<HEADLINE> Gardner Recalls 'The Fantasticks'  </HEADLINE>
By MARY CAMPBELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Actress Rita Gardner remembers a time when ''you
could put on a show in an attic or a basement and people would
come.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was experimental and interesting, and it was cheap to do a
show off-Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Gardner recalls ''The Fantasticks,'' which cost
$16,000 to produce 40 years ago. It is still performed at the
Sullivan Street Playhouse in Greenwich Village, where it opened on
May 3, 1960, and is one of the longest running plays in history.
</P>
<P>
   The musical, best known for the song ''Try to Remember,'' is
based on Edmond Rostand's ''Les Romanesques.'' The story is a
reverse ''Romeo and Juliet'' in which parents invent a feud to
bring their children together.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Orbach, now one of the stars of NBC's ''Law and Order,''
played the part of El Gallo, the narrator. Gardner was the girl and
Kenneth Nelson was the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''My favorite song was at the end, a duet with the boy, 'They
Were You.' I sang 'Round and Round,' 'This Plum Is Too Nice' and
'Soon It's Gonna Rain.' Jerry Orbach started with 'Try to
Remember.' I don't think any critic chose that song as special. But
singers started to record it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Fantasticks'' was not Gardner's first off-Broadway show.
She was in ''Hex,'' an Amish musical, and ''Nightcap,'' a revue of
Jerry Herman songs. When she read about ''The Fantasticks'' in the
trade publication Variety, she thought it was a revue. She called
to request an audition, but producer Lore Noto told her ''the
writers know who they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner persisted.
</P>
<P>
   ''I convinced him to hear me sing,'' she said. ''It was in
(composer) Harvey Schmidt's apartment. They had me come back and
back again, and I got it.''
</P>
<P>
   In rehearsals, the cast had a good time but was unsure what the
whimsical show was about, Gardner said. ''Nobody thought about how
difficult it would be or would it last. We just were putting on a
show.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the reviews.
</P>
<P>
   '''Ernest in Love,' a musical based on 'The Importance of Being
Earnest,' got all the raves. It came and went,'' Gardner said.
''Noto was told to close. He wouldn't, even if we played for five
people. The theater has 150 seats. I think tickets were $5.''
</P>
<P>
   The turning point came when ''The Fantasticks'' played in East
Hampton on nearby Long Island for a week in August. ''All the posh
people saw it and told their friends. Audiences started to grow,''
she said. ''The album started to help the show, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner left the show after nine months for a part in the movie
''One Plus One.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, her career has had its ups and downs.
</P>
<P>
   ''You get into that middle place where you're too old for some
things and too young for some things,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She performed in ''Eleanor, an American Love Story'' at Ford's
Theatre in Washington, D.C., playing the part of Franklin
Roosevelt's mother Sara. She toured as the mother in ''Kiss of the
Spider Woman'' for eight months. Her favorite roles in regional
theater were in ''The Workroom,'' a story about the Holocaust, and
''Lucy's Lapses,'' about Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just did a 'Law and Order' where I played a grandmother who
sells used undergarments on the Internet. It's very funny. I would
never get that 10 years ago. Now I'm reaching the point I can play
those parts. It's a lot of fun. I don't mind at all,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner has put together a cabaret act, ''Try to Remember -- a
Look at Off-Broadway,'' which she performs each Saturday night
following ''The Fantasticks.'' She talks about the original cast
and sings ''Fantasticks'' songs, including ''Try to Remember.'' She
also performs songs from other off-Broadway shows.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought, 'Why not do something I was a part of and try to
make it enjoyable for people?''' she said.

<P>
   In the birthday spotlight:
</P>
<P>
   Glen Campbell's ''Wichita Lineman'' was among 49 recordings
inducted into the music industry's Hall of Fame this year.
Campbell, who was born on April 22, 1936, is proud of his guitar
playing on the song. '''Wichita Lineman' has more chords than 25
country songs,'' he said in an interview. ''Most country acts who
sing it don't play along, they just strum.''
</P>
<P>
   Comedian-actor Martin Lawrence says he had to learn how to walk
again after his near-death collapse while jogging last August.
''You go under, your functions, everything, shuts down. I had to
learn to walk again. All kinds of stuff. It was a real traumatic
experience,'' he told ''Entertainment Tonight,'' a syndicated TV
show. Lawrence collapsed while jogging in heavy clothing in
100-degree heat. He was trying to lose weight for a movie. Lawrence
was born on April 16, 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Andie MacDowell says the best part of being an actress is trying
to understand what motivates people. That's what she told fans at
the Cathedral of All Souls, an historic Asheville, N.C., church
where she is a parishioner and is known by her real name Rose
Qualley. ''The fun part is you get to study people. You understand
why people act the way they do, and you have compassion for them,''
said MacDowell, who starred in ''Groundhog Day'' and ''Four
Weddings and a Funeral.'' MacDowell was born on April 21, 1958. She
has a home in the Asheville area.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Set Aside Sequoia Tract  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is expected to set aside
355,000 acres of forests in California as a federal monument to
permanently protect groves of giant sequoia trees in Sequoia
National Forest, officials said today.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will announce his decision Saturday, accepting the
recommendation of Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman to preserve
the majestic trees and protect them from logging. The president
will make the announcement at the forest in central California.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite their tremendous size, giant sequoias are
vulnerable,'' Glickman said in forwarding his recommendation to
Clinton last week. ''They are very much affected by what happens on
the surrounding forest. Logging or nearby development can
profoundly affect water quality in the groves and threaten the
long-term survival of these rare trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to protect the groves under the 1906
Antiquities Act, as he did earlier this year to ensure permanent
protection over a vast stretch of land adjacent to the Grand
Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists for years have campaigned to impose greater
protection of the giant sequoia trees -- about 70 groves in all --
that are located in Kings Canyon, Sequoia and Yosemite national
parks and nearby Sequoia National Forest in central California.
</P>
<P>
   While about a third of the groves are protected within the
national park systems, the rest are in the national forest and
could be endangered by future logging or other development.
Environmentalists fear that while the trees themselves might not be
cut, nearby logging could threaten their long-term existence.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has used the Antiquities Act on several occasions to
carve out major areas of land for special protection, each time
meeting strong criticism from some western lawmakers and state
officials. White House officials have acknowledged that the actions
are part of an attempt by the president to leave an environmental
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   The sequoia announcement will be made during a trip that begins
Friday with an education speech and political fundraisers in
Atlanta and then moves west to California. After visiting Sequoia
National Forest, Clinton will continue to Los Angeles for a
fundraiser Saturday night with Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   After a day off Sunday, Clinton will begin a two-day tour to
encourage investment in areas of the country that are not
benefitting from the economic good times. He will start his trip
Monday in East Palo Alto, Calif., which has been left behind from
Silicon Valley's prosperity. Later that day, the president will
visit a Navajo Indian reservation at Shiprock, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   He will conclude his trip Tuesday with an appearance in Chicago
at a high-technology show, COMDEX, where he will encourage efforts
to narrow the ''digital divide'' between computer haves and
have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will return to Washington on Tuesday and set out again
Wednesday, this time to help dedicate a memorial in Oklahoma City
in honor of the 168 people killed in the Oklahoma City bombing five
years ago.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 174.71; Dow Up 36.92  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks fell sharply for a third
straight session today after a Goldman Sachs analyst lowered his
estimate for Microsoft's revenue in the last quarter. Blue-chip
shares rose after a strong earnings report from J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index was
down 174.71 at 3,881.19. In volatile trading, the index had dipped
to a loss of as much as 200 points in early trading and again at
midday.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Dow Jones industrial
average was up 36.92 at 11,324.00, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 11.33 at 1,489.26.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft fell 4| to 79\, depressing the Nasdaq and hemming in
the Dow's advance. This morning, Goldman Sachs analyst Rick
Sherlund cut his revenue estimate for the company's fiscal third
quarter to $5.75 billion from $5.95 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sherlund said in a research note that personal computer sales
during the quarter appear to have missed Goldman Sachs's earlier
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a further negative for sentiment in a poor tech
market,'' Sherlund said. Computer makers slumped on the news; Dell
fell 2| to 52 13/16 and IBM fell 4| to 114{ on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Sherlund maintained his third-quarter earnings estimate on
Microsoft of 41 cents a share, compared with 35 cents a year ago,
noting that the lower revenue would likely be offset by gains in
the company's investment portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's slide provided the latest catalyst for the ongoing
decline of the Nasdaq. The index, which set a closing record of
5,048.62 on March 10, has tumbled 23 percent since then, and is now
down 4.7 percent in the year to date.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's decline accelerated last week, when the index fell
more than 400 points over the course of two wildly volatile
sessions. Now, analysts are divided on whether the index is headed
back toward its low point of about 3,650 or poised for a round of
bargain-hunting.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, analysts say, the volatile action has brought
some welcome skepticism to the technology market.
</P>
<P>
   ''Investors will be more discriminating in their buying of
technology and Internet stocks,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, chief
market strategist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan rose 4 9/16 to 139 5/16, buoying the Dow. The
investment bank easily exceeded Wall Street's earnings estimates,
posting first-quarter profits of $3.37 a share. Analysts surveyed
by First Call/Thomson Financial had anticipated earnings of $2.81 a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Clorox rose 3] to 40 11/16 after the company secured an
arrangement with online grocer Webvan to sell its products over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 509.25 million
shares, ahead of Tuesday's pace. On the Nasdaq, decliners led by a
margin of nearly three stocks to one.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 8.69 to 501.44.

<HEADLINE> Trees 'Silent Witnesses' to History  </HEADLINE>
By RON WORD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- They stood as silent witnesses to the
lives of George Washington, Andrew Jackson, Amelia Earhart, Henry
David Thoreau, Henry Ford and Elvis Presley.
</P>
<P>
   They provided cover for the Nez Perce Indians, shuddered from
the cannon of the Civil War, and sprouted from seeds taken to the
moon.
</P>
<P>
   They are America's historic trees, and their story is told in a
new video produced by WCJT, North Florida's public television
station. The hour-long documentary, narrated by actor James
Whitmore, is airing on public television stations this month (check
local listings).
</P>
<P>
   ''Silent Witnesses'' traces American history from the birth of
California's bristlecone pines to the sycamore seeds that the
Apollo 14 astronauts took to the moon, and which are now growing on
the campus at Mississippi State University in Starkville, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Whitmore, known for his portrayals of Will Rogers, Teddy
Roosevelt and Harry Truman, said the documentary gave him a new
appreciation of trees.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are all from the earth and we will return to it,'' Whitmore
said.
</P>
<P>
   The video took more than two years to produce, and is enhanced
with interviews from the descendants of historic trees' original
caretakers, including George E. Pickett V; the grandson of Chief
Joseph; a relative of Johnny Appleseed, and Andrew Jackson VI.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes you realize the importance of trees in the history of
this country,'' said Jackson, a district attorney in Knoxville,
Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Two magnolia trees planted by President Jackson in memory of his
deceased wife, Rachael, more than 160 years ago are still on the
grounds of the White House. One of the trees can be seen on the
back of the old $20 bill.
</P>
<P>
   Whitmore said he was most fascinated with the story of John
Chapman, who is better known as Johnny Appleseed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had always thought it was folklore and I was astonished to
learn he was a real person who planted thousands of trees,''
Whitmore said.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one trees are featured in the documentary. One of the
more poignant stories is that of James Wayman Johnson, who hung his
scythe in the crook of a tree, vowing to finish his work after he
returned from the Civil War. Johnson died in battle and the tip of
the blade is still visible in the tree in Waterloo, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The program also features trees in American Forests' Famous and
Historic Trees project -- trees that came from seeds of trees that
were present during historically significant lives and events.
Grown in Jacksonville, the trees are available for planting by
individuals and organizations. The Washington-based American
Forests, established in 1875, is the nation's oldest non-profit
citizens conservation organization.
</P>
<P>
   American presidents are linked to many of the trees, including a
tulip poplar planted by George Washington at Mt. Vernon; a honey
locust that shaded Abraham Lincoln as he gave the Gettysburg
Address; and the post oak that shades the grave of John F. Kennedy
at Arlington National Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the trees were at Civil War battles, including the
sycamore at Antietam Creek in Sharpsburg, Md., where that war's
bloodiest battle took place in September 1862, and the group of
trees in Gettysburg, Pa., that were the objective of Major Gen.
George E. Pickett's Confederate troops during their doomed charge.
</P>
<P>
   There's also an Osage orange tree that grows outside Patrick
Henry's home in Red Hill, Va.; a sycamore outside Fairlane, Henry
Ford's estate in Dearborn, Mich.; a sugar maple at Amelia Earhart's
girlhood home in Atkinson, Kan.; and a pine oak at Graceland, Elvis
Presley's home in Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   A film crew spent three days waiting in the rain near Boston to
film a red maple tree at Walden Pond.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Bronakowski, the program's producer and director, traveled
the country in search of the best trees, and was deeply affected by
the stories they tell.
</P>
<P>
   ''The feeling of history is really awesome,'' he said.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Swooning technology stocks, led by a slide in
Microsoft, deepened the Nasdaq composite's retreat Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Microsoft is a component of the Dow industrials,
Wall Street's best-known indicator was holding on to gains as money
continued to flow into traditional blue-chip issues.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was down more than 4.5 percent, or by 3.81\ a share,
at 80.06\ in afternoon trading.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq briefly fell as much as 203 points and was down
155.22, or 3.8 percent, at 3,900.68 by early afternoon. The
technology-focused index now has fallen almost 23 percent from its
peak of 5,048.62 reached on March 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 74.15 at 11,361.23.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft prices fell after Goldman Sachs analyst Rick Sherlund
cut his revenue estimate for the software company's fiscal third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a further negative for sentiment in a poor tech
market,'' Sherlund said.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks have been slumping amid worries that upcoming
first-quarter earnings reports won't justify the high prices of
tech issues.
</P>
<P>
   Among Old Economy stocks, J.P. Morgan rose sharply on a strong
earnings report, buoying the Dow.

By The Associated Press	   Audio reviews from The Associated Press:
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''Sao Salvador'' (Putumayo) -- Ricardo Lemvo &AMP; Makina Loca
</P>
<P>
   ''Sao Salvador'' is an instantly engaging trip through
Afro-Caribbean pop. Ricardo Lemvo gleefully mixes styles: Cuban son
with Congolese rumba, merengue with soukous. His love of American
soul comes through, as well, especially on the deeply funky
''Nganga Kisi.'' The emphasis in his Afro-Cuban mix, though, is
almost always on the African elements, and the band is tight enough
to go instantly wherever Lemvo points it.
</P>
<P>
   You do not need to be an ethnomusicologist to appreciate ''Sao
Salvador.'' All you need is ears to listen, and it would help to
have a foot to tap, too. The overall effect is joyous and
wonderful, making ''Sao Salvador'' riotously addictive, essential
for fans of Afro-pop and a good starting point for those interested
but not sure where to begin.
</P>
<P>
   -- By Eric Fidler, Associated Press Writer
</P>
<P>
   ''Orfeu'' (Nonesuch) -- Caetano Veloso
</P>
<P>
   Caetano Veloso is sometimes called the Brazilian Bob Dylan, and
is renowned as one of his country's greatest singer-songwriters.
''Orfeu'' is a soundtrack, full of orchestrated (and occasionally
over-orchestrated) pieces, so it won't really prove that point to
those unfamiliar with his work. Still, it's an interesting and
frequently lovely piece of work, full of gently swaying bossa novas
and raucous sambas, a sort of sampler of Brazilian music. The
highlight is the breezy, bittersweet ''Os Cinco Bailes da Historia
do Rio,'' which is simply Veloso's voice and Heitor TP's lyrical
guitar.
</P>
<P>
   -- By Eric Fidler, Associated Press Writer
</P>
<P>
   ''Good Things'' (Tone-Cool) -- Toni Lynn Washington
</P>
<P>
   Toni Lynn Washington is the real deal, a soul-blues singer with
a rich, smoky voice she uses to mine each phrase for all its
emotion. The tight, funky horn arrangements propel ''Good Things,''
but it's Washington's vocal prowess that really raises it a cut
above. ''Good Things'' should appeal to fans of Ruth Brown, Aretha
Franklin or other great soul singers.
</P>
<P>
   --By Eric Fidler, Associated Press Writer
</P>
<P>
   ''Get Over It'' (Atlantic Records) -- Mr. Big
</P>
<P>
   Hard rock fans relish Mr. Big's new release ''Get Over It.''
</P>
<P>
   Guitar whiz Richie Kotzen, who replaced the popular Paul
Gilbert, has filled his shoes quite nicely and has added a touch of
his own style to the band. The track ''Static'' has Kotzen giving
his best Hendrix impersonation and Billy Sheehan backing him with
dazzling bass licks.
</P>
<P>
   Lyrically, ''Get Over It'' finds singer Eric Martin moving from
the pop-metal scene of the '80s to a more personal, insightful
style. ''My New Religion'' addresses the need for one to accept
life's risks in order to find reward.
</P>
<P>
   ''Get Over It'' is Mr. Big's first U.S. release in five years,
but the band has not lost a beat.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 156.18; Dow Up 120.07  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks fell sharply for a third
straight session today after a Goldman Sachs analyst lowered his
estimate for Microsoft's revenue in the last quarter. Blue-chip
shares rose after a strong earnings report from J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   In midafternoon trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite
index was down 156.18 at 3,899.72. In volatile trading, the index
had dipped to a loss of as much as 200 points in early trading and
again at midday.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Dow Jones industrial
average was up 120.07 at 11,407.15, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 3.30 at 1,497.29.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft fell 4] to 79{, depressing the Nasdaq and hemming in
the Dow's advance. This morning, Goldman Sachs analyst Rick
Sherlund cut his revenue estimate for the company's fiscal third
quarter to $5.75 billion from $5.95 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sherlund said in a research note that personal computer sales
during the quarter appear to have missed Goldman Sachs's earlier
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a further negative for sentiment in a poor tech
market,'' Sherlund said. Computer makers slumped on the news; Dell
fell 2{ to 52 15/16 and IBM fell 4} to 114] on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Sherlund maintained his third-quarter earnings estimate on
Microsoft of 41 cents a share, compared with 35 cents a year ago,
noting that the lower revenue would likely be offset by gains in
the company's investment portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's slide provided the latest catalyst for the ongoing
decline of the Nasdaq. The index, which set a closing record of
5,048.62 on March 10, has tumbled 23 percent since then, and is now
down more than 4 percent in the year to date.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's decline accelerated last week, when the index fell
more than 400 points over the course of two wildly volatile
sessions. Now, analysts are divided on whether the index is headed
back toward its low point of about 3,650 or poised for a round of
bargain-hunting.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, analysts say, the volatile action has brought
some welcome skepticism to the technology market.
</P>
<P>
   ''Investors will be more discriminating in their buying of
technology and Internet stocks,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, chief
market strategist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings reports continued to drive the market. Enron rose 3
7/16 to 71} after reporting first-quarter earnings of 40 cents a
share. Analysts had anticipated earnings of 37 cents a share. The
strong report confirmed expectations that energy companies will
show the sharpest profit growth for the recently ended quarter.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan rose 5| to 140], buoying the Dow. The investment
bank easily exceeded Wall Street's earnings estimates, posting
first-quarter profits of $3.37 a share. Analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thomson Financial had anticipated earnings of $2.81 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Other financial stocks rose amid expectations that they, too,
will report strong earnings. American Express rose 7 11/16 to 152~.
</P>
<P>
   Clorox rose 2] to 39 11/16 after the company secured an
arrangement with online grocer Webvan to sell its products over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 765.46 million shares
at midafternoon, compared with 678.21 million at the same time
Tuesday. On the Nasdaq, decliners led by a margin of nearly three
stocks to one.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 5.90 to 504.23.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Admits DiCaprio Deception  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- A Romanian film company said Wednesday
its announcement that Leonardo DiCaprio would make a film here was
just wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Romania's Castel Film Studios had announced Monday that DiCaprio
would star in a science-fiction movie, ''Librium,'' to be shot in
Bucharest in August.
</P>
<P>
   DiCaprio's agents, Ken Sunshine Consultants Inc., denied it
Tuesday and Castel Film Studies backed off its previous statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is common in the movie business to air well-known names
before the casting is actually being done ... and DiCaprio's name
was aired as a wish of ours, not as a certainty,'' Castel
spokeswoman Calina Pirotici said.
</P>
<P>
   Castel had used DiCaprio's name while seeking permission from
the Romanian Chamber of Deputies to use the parliament building for
location shots, Pirotici said.
</P>
<P>
   DiCaprio's alleged travel to Romania was on the front pages of
most newspapers here Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> NSA Denies Spying on Americans  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a rare public appearance before Congress,
the director of the super-secret National Security Agency today
denied that his organization is targeting Americans at home or
abroad for high-tech spying.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are absolutely clear rules. They are well known. And
they are well respected,'' Air Force Lt. Gen. Michael V. Hayden
told the House intelligence committee.
</P>
<P>
   He disputed published and broadcast reports, in Europe and
elsewhere, that the United States was involved in the monitoring of
e-mail and other communications of ordinary Americans as part of a
satellite surveillance network.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden also denied that his agency -- which is prohibited by law
from spying on Americans unless there are direct national-security
implications -- had engaged in industrial espionage to benefit U.S.
companies.
</P>
<P>
   His denials were echoed by CIA Director George Tenet.
</P>
<P>
   ''I recognize that it is standard practice for some countries to
use their intelligence services to conduct economic espionage. But
that is not the policy or the practice of the United States,''
Tenet said.
</P>
<P>
   As to using surveillance techniques ''against the private
conversations of U.S. persons, I will say to this committee
unequivocally that this is not the case,'' Tenet said.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual public hearing was held by intelligence committee
Chairman Porter Goss, R-Fla., to air what he said were allegations
that the NSA had violated its charter by spying on Americans and
conducting industrial espionage.
</P>
<P>
   At the conclusion of the hearing, Goss said he was satisfied
that ''our safeguards are in place and are working.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a satellite surveillance network, called
''Echelon,'' said to be a joint effort by the United States,
Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence officials have never confirmed the existence
of such a network, but neither do they deny it.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., who has pressed for more information on
the scope of the spy network's capabilities, told Hayden and Tenet,
''We still have more questions than answers regarding the substance
of allegations about such NSA activities as Project Echelon...Our
citizens are left with a feeling of unease that is unhealthy both
to our intelligence community as well as to our citizens
themselves.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Facing Marriage Tax Impasse  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As senators tried to break an impasse on a
bill cutting income taxes for married couples, the House refused
again Wednesday to back a constitutional amendment requiring a
two-thirds vote of Congress to raise most taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The hangup on the GOP's 10-year, $248 billion marriage tax cut
was insistence by Senate Democrats on the right to offer a number
of amendments, particularly one creating a new Medicare
prescription drug benefit. They also wanted a vote on their own
marriage tax cut, which is far less costly.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Republicans can come up with money for a tax cut, but they
can't come up with the money to provide a prescription drug
benefit,'' said Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Unless an agreement is reached, the Senate is set to vote
Thursday on a Republican motion to end delaying tactics and begin
consideration of the bill, which would gradually reduce income
taxes for almost all married couples, including the 25 million who
now pay higher ''marriage penalty'' taxes than they would if
single.
</P>
<P>
   ''For 10 years, we have talked about the unfairness of the
marriage penalty tax,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss. ''We're going to see who is for eliminating it and who is
not.''
</P>
<P>
   The House earlier this year passed a smaller marriage tax cut
totaling $182 billion over 10 years. President Clinton has
threatened to veto both GOP bills, saying they would consume too
much of the projected budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   As they do each year, Republican congressional leaders are using
the final week of the annual income tax filing season to underscore
their political priorities for tax cuts and tax reform. A part of
that ritual was acted out again Wednesday when the House again
failed to approve a constitutional amendment requiring a two-thirds
vote of Congress to raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment, which required a two-thirds vote itself to pass,
fell 50 votes short, a modest improvement over last year's 57-vote
margin. Opponents, including 14 Republicans, had trouble taking the
issue seriously, and it went down on a 234-192 vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one thinks this is going anywhere,'' said Rep. Barney
Frank, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters said they wouldn't give up, arguing that drawing
distinctions for voters between Republicans and Democrats on taxes
was a key reason the measure kept returning each year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is important for people to understand that it is too easy
for Congress to raise taxes,'' said Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas.
''It may take us 20 more years, it may take us five more years, but
it is the right thing to do.''

<HEADLINE> Papers Take Steps To Restore Trust  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Newspapers have found that readers will
forgive them their trespasses if they own up to them.
</P>
<P>
   Making corrections more prominent and making efforts to connect
up close with readers -- even letting them help edit stories -- are
identified in an editors' study as ways to rebuild trust with a
public that sees papers as aloof and even biased.
</P>
<P>
   The American Society of Newspaper Editors, three years into an
examination of the profession's credibility, heard Wednesday from
editors who took unusual and sometimes elaborate steps to involve
readers in what they do, part of an ASNE project.
</P>
<P>
   ''Readers and non-readers alike voiced overwhelming faith that
these kind of credibility initiatives could achieve their goal,''
says the study, released at the ASNE convention.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts were aggressively promoted so readers would get the
message. But editors were cautioned not to expect quick and
sweeping results, because steps to bring a paper closer to the
community are bound to involve only a small portion of the
population.
</P>
<P>
   Eight newspapers acted as test sites last year, following up on
national surveys that found most readers perceive papers to be
disconnected from their concerns, acting for profit or an agenda
instead of the community interest and making too many mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Among steps taken in response:
</P>
<P>
   --Florida Today in Melbourne invited citizens to work alongside
copy editors, proofreading stories before they went into the paper.
</P>
<P>
   --In Texas, the Austin American-Statesman set up public meetings
to get people to dissect what appeared in the paper, then published
their observations.
</P>
<P>
   --In Colorado Springs, Colo., The Gazette formed ''audit teams''
from the community to advise on coverage of blacks, Hispanics,
women and youth, and reported their findings in the paper.
</P>
<P>
   --The Daily Press in Newport News, Va., sent teams to
neighborhoods not in the grip of any particular crisis and profiled
one neighborhood a month.
</P>
<P>
   The paper also held weekly editorial board meetings in
restaurants, where citizens could attend, and has set aside space
each day, separate from letters to the editor, where readers can
gripe about coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors were initially shocked when reporters showed up and
said, ''We're here because nothing's happening ... we're just here
to talk about your lives,'' Editor Will F. Corbin told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Other papers experimented with ''reader advocates'' and
redoubled efforts to admit and fix mistakes. They found prominent
corrections improved good will.
</P>
<P>
   ''Errors can be forgiven but confession is required,'' said
research consultant Judy Pace Christie.
</P>
<P>
   Polling indicated almost eight in 10 readers feel better about a
paper when they see corrections.
</P>
<P>
   Aware that the selection and placement of stories often leave
readers suspecting bias, several editors tried publishing
explanations of how such judgments are made, sometimes putting
those accounts on the front page.
</P>
<P>
   But that step had limited success; while it engaged some
readers, others confused the explanations with news summaries. As
well, there was a limit as to how much people wanted to know about
a paper's innards.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, a reader advocate's position rotates among the staff
at the Sarasota Herald-Tribune and serves as a one-stop shop for
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Executive Editor Janet Weaver said she also paid bonuses to news
assistants for avoiding mistakes in compiling listings. But she
gave up on that, in part because the newsroom felt accuracy was
basic to the job and not something to be rewarded on the side.
</P>
<P>
   The Oregonian in Portland stopped emphasizing the sensational
aspects of its crime coverage and broadened its examination of
youth issues by bringing more young voices into the coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Inquirer focused on its New Jersey readership,
making coverage of South Jersey a ''paper within a paper.''
</P>
<P>
   And at the San Jose Mercury News in California, an accuracy and
fairness checklist became required reading before most stories
could get into the paper.
</P>
<P>
   Something as simple as double-checking phone numbers that appear
in the paper can pay off, said Executive Editor David Yarnold.
''Credibility is in large part about getting back to basics.''

<HEADLINE> Senators Push for Victims' Rights  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers should pass a constitutional
amendment to protect victims' rights and give a voice to those the
system ''failed to protect,'' supporters urged Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to vote on the measure after the Easter
recess. Supporters Wednesday urged support as the nation marked
National Crime Victims' Week.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional amendment will give crime victims ''certain
basic rights,'' said Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz and one of the measure's
sponsors. ''The scales of justice need balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. and also a sponsor, said the
Constitution guarantees 15 basic rights to defendants ''but there
is not one word written in the U.S. Constitution on behalf of crime
victims.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure would ensure that victims have the rights to
reasonable notice of court proceedings and an offender's release or
escape, the right to attend and be heard at legal proceedings and
the right to an order of restitution.
</P>
<P>
   A similar proposal is pending in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Roper, co-chair of the National Victims Rights Amendment
Network, said she was locked out of the judicial process when her
22-year-old daughter Stephanie was kidnapped, raped and murdered 18
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unlike those who make the criminal choice, you don't have any
rights,'' Roper said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Unilever Bulks Up, Then Slims Down  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE STANLEY, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Like the guy at the diner who orders a hot-fudge
sundae and a diet cola, Unilever on Wednesday gobbled up the Ben &AMP;
Jerry's ice cream business even as it downed Slim-Fast Foods.
</P>
<P>
   The $2.6 billion spending spree raises the question of whether
these deals will create corporate indigestion at a time when the
Anglo-Dutch Unilever is cutting down its lineup of consumer brands
and eliminating 10 percent of its jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unilever is a bit schizophrenic,'' said Andy Smith, a consumer
products analyst at Schroders investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's trying to downsize its portfolio on the one side and yet
trying to boost performance in its core brands on the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Unilever, the consumer products company behind such household
names as Lipton, Vaseline and Pepsodent, plans to slash 25,000 jobs
over five years as it tries to reverse a slump in profits and its
share price.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has headquarters in England and the
Netherlands, announced the cuts in February as part of a global
reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, Unilever disclosed plans to concentrate on just
400 of its current 1,800 brands. Among the businesses under review
are fragrance and cosmetics unit Elizabeth Arden and its European
bakery operations.
</P>
<P>
   However, restructuring doesn't mean that Unilever is swearing
off acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically what they admitted is that the portfolio is too
complex,'' Smith said after an analysts' conference call with
Unilever executives. ''It has too many brands, and what they're
trying to do is cut out the losers and keep the winners.''
</P>
<P>
   Unilever's wide array of brands includes Calvin Klein
fragrances, Dove soap, Close-Up toothpaste and Q-tips swabs. It
also is the world's largest ice cream company, with brands
including Good-Humor, Breyers, Popsicle and Klondike.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the company's $2.3 billion buyout of Slim-Fast Foods
Co. and $326 million purchase of Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade Inc. are
''strategically very sensible acquisitions'' over the long term,
even though they are likely to dilute Unilever's earnings per share
on a short-term basis.
</P>
<P>
   Investors seemed to agree. Unilever's stock jumped 4.8 percent
from Tuesday's close to end trading in London at about $6.90 a
share, based on current exchange rates. That helped Unilever shares
recover some of the ground lost in recent months as investors
abandoned stodgy industries such as consumer goods for the glitter
of high-tech shares.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are the overwhelming consumers of Slim-Fast products,
but the brand of diet products has strong potential in Europe,
Smith said. Slim-Fast sales increased by 20 percent last year,
though operating profit margins slipped from 22 percent to 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ben &AMP; Jerry's plugs a gap for Unilever in the premium end of the
ice cream market. At the same time, it gives Unilever a strong
product with which to compete against Nestle's Haagen-Dazs brand,
the analyst said.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever hopes to trim its overall costs by 4 percent to 5
percent over the next five year as part of its $5.3 billion
restructuring drive.
</P>
<P>
   The company's 1999 net profit slipped 5 percent to $2.97
billion, in spite of a 2 percent rise in sales last year to $43.7
billion.

<HEADLINE> More Details in Infant-Death Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- A sailor hurled his infant son to the
pavement, killing the boy, as he ran from Navy investigators
seeking to question him about money missing from his ship, police
say.
</P>
<P>
   Two agents had gone to question Petty Officer 1st Class Johnny
Pittman at his home Friday about missing payroll funds aboard the
USS Vicksburg. He was among the crew members entrusted to
distribute the money.
</P>
<P>
   Pittman ran from the agents, carrying his 8-month-old son,
Johnny Jr. About a block away, he threw the child down, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pittman was later taken into custody by the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   The infant died of his injuries Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Because Pittman, 34, was not on base when he allegedly injured
his child, civilian prosecutors appear to have jurisdiction in that
case, but no immediate charges were filed.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 182.10; Dow Up 89.97  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks fell sharply for a third
straight session today after a Goldman Sachs analyst lowered his
estimate for Microsoft's revenue in the last quarter. Blue-chip
shares rose after a strong earnings report from J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the
Nasdaq composite index was down 182.10 at 3,873.80 and appeared
poised for its first close below 4,000 since Jan. 31. In volatile
trading, the index dipped to a loss of as much as 200 points in
early trading and again at midday.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Dow Jones industrial
average was up 89.97 at 11,377.05, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 4.97 at 1,495.62.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft fell 4 9/16 to 79 5/16, depressing the Nasdaq and
hemming in the Dow's advance. This morning, Goldman Sachs analyst
Rick Sherlund cut his revenue estimate for the company's fiscal
third quarter to $5.75 billion from $5.95 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sherlund said in a research note that personal computer sales
during the quarter appear to have missed Goldman Sachs's earlier
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a further negative for sentiment in a poor tech
market,'' Sherlund said. Computer makers slumped on the news; Dell
fell 2 11/16 to 52} and IBM fell 5[ to 114 on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Sherlund maintained his third-quarter earnings estimate on
Microsoft of 41 cents a share, compared with 35 cents a year ago,
noting that the lower revenue would likely be offset by gains in
the company's investment portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's slide provided the latest catalyst for the ongoing
decline of the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   ''If investors think there's a prick in the bubble, that gives
them a reason to get out of some stocks that are making them
nervous anyway,'' said Robert M. Balentine, chief executive officer
of investment advisory firm Balentine &AMP; Co. in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The index, which set a closing record of 5,048.62 on March 10,
has tumbled 23 percent since then, and is now down more than 4
percent in the year to date.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's decline accelerated last week, when the index fell
more than 400 points over the course of two wildly volatile
sessions. Now, analysts are divided on whether the index is headed
back toward its low point of about 3,650 or poised for a round of
bargain-hunting.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, analysts say, the volatility has brought some
welcome skepticism to the technology market.
</P>
<P>
   ''Investors will be more discriminating in their buying of
technology and Internet stocks,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, chief
market strategist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings reports continued to drive the market. Enron rose 3} to
72 1/16 after reporting first-quarter earnings of 40 cents a share.
Analysts had anticipated earnings of 37 cents a share. The strong
report confirmed expectations that energy companies will show the
sharpest profit growth for the recently ended quarter.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan rose 5 5/16 to 140 1/16, buoying the Dow. The
investment bank easily exceeded Wall Street's earnings estimates,
posting first-quarter profits of $3.37 a share. Analysts surveyed
by First Call/Thomson Financial had anticipated earnings of $2.81 a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Other financial stocks rose amid expectations that they, too,
will report strong earnings. American Express rose 7 9/16 to 152}.
</P>
<P>
   Clorox rose 2~ to 40 3/16 after the company secured an
arrangement with online grocer Webvan to sell its products over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 893.94 million
shares, compared with 786.72 million at the same time Tuesday. On
the Nasdaq, decliners led by a margin of three stocks to one.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 8.13 to 502.00.

<HEADLINE> House Panel OKs Federal Spending  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN, AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's schools have long complained the
federal government requires them to educate children with
disabilities without sending enough money to pay for it. House
lawmakers on Wednesday sought to fix one of the most costly -- and
emotional -- issues schools face with a $2 billion a year guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress made a promise to children and families with special
education needs,'' said Rep. Bill Goodling, R- Pa., chairman of the
House Education and Work Force Committee, which boosted the federal
share of what schools spend on special education from 12.6 percent
to 40 percent. ''If we had kept our promise, school districts would
have the funds necessary to build new schools, hire new teachers,
reduce class size and buy new computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodling said the 1975 Individual With Disabilities Act called
for a 40 percent contribution as part of its requirement that
schools educate disabled youngsters. Often, such children -- whose
disabilities range from the physical to specific problems on
learning -- were sent to institutions or remained at homes, where
they didn't get quality instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 6 million children receive special education instruction
and services costing $60 billion, $5.7 billion of that from the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   But some schools have felt burdened by the mission. Last year,
the Supreme Court ruled that a Cedar Rapids, Iowa, school district
would have to pay the $30,000 bill for the nursing care of
paralyzed high school student on a ventilator. The National School
Boards Association estimates that 17,000 children nationwide have
such high-cost needs.
</P>
<P>
   The House panel's act, agreed to by all members by a voice vote,
may be largely symbolic. Last week, Senate lawmakers haggling over
the budget rejected a similar plan -- some feared locking the
federal government into spending that could take away flexibility
from the overall budget to pay for tax cuts. There are no immediate
plans to offer another special education spending proposal, Senate
aides said.
</P>
<P>
   But over four years, the Republican-led Congress has increased
what it spends on special education, said Joseph Karpinski,
spokesman for Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., chairman of the Senate
Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is broad support,'' he said. ''When educators come to
Washington, this is one of major issues they talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   The House panel Wednesday continued its work on a slate of
school safety programs included in federal spending on elementary
and secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats say President Clinton will reject this latest
round of education lawmaking because it dilutes his priorities such
as after-school centers. Under this bill, schools could take money
marked for such programs and shift it to the school-safety programs
they prefer. For example, class-size reduction grants could be used
for character education instead.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan: Hoffa in My Cabinet  </HEADLINE>
Laurie Kellman
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sharing a stage with unlikely allies, Reform
Party presidential hopeful Patrick Buchanan on Wednesday promised
protesting Teamsters he would appoint union president James Hoffa
to his Cabinet and oppose normal U.S. trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   Approving such status for China, which President Clinton wants,
would hand American jobs and money to a nation with a poor human
rights record, Buchanan told several thousand Teamsters gathered in
the Capitol's shadow.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's something that unites us all. It's the belief that
citizens of the United States are citizens first before they're
consumers and there are values higher than money,'' Buchanan said,
speaking alongside Rep. David Bonoir, D-Mich., Rep. Bernard
Sanders, I-Vt, and other political foes on issues besides trade.
''This battle's about the American family.''
</P>
<P>
   Trade, the centerpiece of Buchanan's third-party presidential
bid, is the link between him and thousands of union members
gathered in Washington to protest next week's meetings of the World
Bank and International Monetary Fund. Buchanan also was present in
Seattle earlier this year when protests turned into riots at a
World Trade Organization meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan registers in single digits in polls that show Democrat
Al Gore and Repubican George W. Bush in a close race.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, a Former Republican, said his administration would not
include a trade representative that would cut deals with nations
that pose threats to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I get there, it won't be (U.S. Trade Representative)
Charlene Barshefsky sitting down in Beijing, it'll be Jim Hoffa,''
Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd cheered and chanted Hoffa's name.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the audience of Teamsters were there less to support the
politicians such as Buchanan than show opposition to a trade deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to hand jobs to China,'' said trucker Jack Silver
of Brooklyn, N.Y. ''If he's for that, I'm for that. But that
doesn't mean I'm for him.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think he's presidential material,'' said Roger Hacker
of Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   But Angelo Barca of Yonkers, N.Y. said Buchanan ''is the only
one who's making sense'' on family issues and trade. ''These people
don't know what they're talking about,'' he added, gesturing to his
fellow Teamsters who are backing other candidates.

<HEADLINE> Comptroller's auditors uncover alleged prison payroll scam  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER JORDAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- State auditors say 10 workers at the
Adirondack Correctional Facility earned salaries and benefits while
working abbreviated schedules and slipping under-the-table payments
to officers who filled in for them.
</P>
<P>
   Comptroller H. Carl McCall's office Wednesday released an audit
on what it called the ''no-show'' jobs and called on the state
Department of Correctional Services to crack down on shift-swapping
policies. Corrections Commissioner Glenn Goord said he was
''reluctantly ordering the development'' of a statewide policy.
</P>
<P>
   Each prison now has its own rules for shift-swapping, agreed
upon with local union officials. Under the rules at the Adirondack
facility, in Raybrook, correction officers could trade shifts with
other workers as long as they worked shifts in return on another
date.
</P>
<P>
   But McCall's office said a review of payroll records for certain
officers from 1995 to 1999 showed that the officers maintained
their benefits while giving away many of their shifts and did not
work others' scheduled hours in exchange. Additionally, McCall's
office said that officers giving away their shifts likely paid
others to take on the extra work -- about $100 per 8-hour shift.
</P>
<P>
   One officer is accused of working only 6 percent of scheduled
work days while eight officers swapped out more than 200 shifts.
One officer allegedly owed more than 800 shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ''These corrections officers would have to work up to four years
of extra shifts, along with their regular work days just to pay
back the time they owe,'' McCall said in a statement. ''At best
this is a gross abuse of the system and more likely it is a
violation of state law.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall's office would not release the identities or ranks of the
officers involved.
</P>
<P>
   While no officer admitted paying or taking payments for the
swaps, McCall's report stated, and state prison officials conceded,
that it was unlikely officers were working for others ''for free as
a gracious gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall's audit pointed out that officers that worked the shifts
avoided paying taxes on the additional income.
</P>
<P>
   McCall was critical of the Department of Correctional Services
and the Adirondack Correctional Facility leadership for not keeping
a closer eye on the shift exchanges. The comptroller, a Democrat,
also lambasted the Corrections Department's Inspector General's
office in the Republican Pataki administration for looking into
similar complaints in 1997 and failing ''to uncover these blatant
abuses of the system.''
</P>
<P>
   The Adirondack facility, which houses up to 713 inmates and
employs 192 officers, changed its swapping policy in October 1999
so that officers with large numbers of unworked swapped shifts were
not allowed to participate in swapping, prison officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Goord said that the officers ''have tainted a local-option
system that worked well for their peers.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would change the statewide policy ''reluctantly
because I know the vast majority of our employees realize that no
one should be allowed an open-ended opportunity to swap shifts.''
</P>
<P>
   The supervisor of the Adirondack prison, Gale McGuane, who has
been in charge of the facility since April 1999, would not comment
on the charges.
</P>
<P>
   The Comptroller sent the audit to the state Inspector General's
office for any potential criminal action. The state Inspector
General's office could not immediately be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   McCall recommended disciplinary action against the accused
officers. The Correctional Services department said it would not
allow the officers to swap away more shifts until they pay back the
old ones.
</P>
<P>
   Two officers resigned after the audit began, though it could not
be determined whether those who resigned knew about the audit or
resigned because of it, McCall's office said. As for penalties
against those two officers who resigned, spokesman James Flateau
said, ''That's something we'll explore to see if any action can be
taken.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall's office said the investigation began after they received
a complaint about the swapping practices.

<HEADLINE> House Flushes High-Flow Toilets  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An effort to repeal the federal law requiring
low-flow toilets could be going down the drain.
</P>
<P>
   A House panel rejected a bill Wednesday that would have
eliminated 1992 federal water conservation regulations for toilets,
urinals, shower heads and faucets.
</P>
<P>
   Current standards require toilets to use 1.6 gallons of water
per flush instead of the 3.5 gallons that was the previous norm.
Supporters say the rules save some 600 million gallons of water a
year and avoid a 50-state patchwork of commode regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would suggest that there is one thing more asinine than
federal regulation of plumbing supplies, and that's 50 different
state standards,'' said Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass. ''Such an
outcome could have a severe constipating effect on interstate
commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the federal standards contend low-powered potties
often take two or three flushes to clear all the waste, eliminating
their conservation benefits. They say consumers should get a
choice.
</P>
<P>
   ''The American people are being forced to use toilets and
showers that simply don't work,'' said Rep. Charles Norwood, R-Ga.
''Privacy and freedom are the only things that are being flushed
away.''
</P>
<P>
   A House Commerce subcommittee voted 13-12 Wednesday to keep the
low-flow toilet regulations. Joining 11 Democrats were two
Republican lawmakers from fast-growing states with limited fresh
water: Reps. Heather Wilson of New Mexico and Michael Bilirakis of
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, the subcommittee's chairman and a
co-sponsor of the bill, said he and other lawmakers have gotten
complaints from numerous people upset with their low-flow toilets --
and angry that the government invades their bathrooms. Plumbers
told the panel last year that a black market has sprung up for
high-capacity toilets smuggled from Canada or Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Barton has no plans to try to resurrect the bill, sponsored
by Rep. Joe Knollenberg, R-Mich., who did not return a call about
whether he would try again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I agree with Mr. Knollenberg when he said, 'Get the federal
government out of the bathroom.' We never should have been there in
the first place,'' Barton said.
</P>
<P>
   Plumbing manufacturers acknowledge complaints about earlier
versions of low-flow toilets but say newer models flush better.
Most municipalities support the current regulations, saying
powerful new bathroom fixtures could overload aging water systems.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should be conserving more water, not less,'' said Rep.
Frank Pallone Jr., D-N.J., whose district includes the headquarters
of toilet-maker American Standard.

<HEADLINE> Moves in Aluminum Merger  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- French aluminum group Pechiney, which has planned
to merge with Canada's Alcan Aluminum and Switzerland's Algroup,
said Wednesday that the companies plan to file a revised merger
plan with the European Commission by April 30 or will abandon plans
for a three-way combination.
</P>
<P>
   If the merger goes through, the new company would be the world's
largest aluminum producer, with a market capitalization of $19
billion and revenue of $17.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't found an agreement to file to the EU,'' Pechiney
spokeswoman Fabunne de Brebisson said Wednesday. If the groups
don't file by April 30, they will drop merger plans, she said. But
she said the group was not abandoning merger talks.
</P>
<P>
   The three companies are trying to renegotiate a linkup that
would satisfy European antitrust regulators who rejected a merger
between Alcan and Pechiney last month. The commission said the
merger would have created ''dominant positions in a number of
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   It already has approved a deal between Alcan and Algroup.
</P>
<P>
   The three companies are looking at measures that would satisfy
the EU's concern, but don't want to ''undermine the rationale of
the merger,'' Alcan spokesman Marc Osboren said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Rally; Grains Also Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybeans bounced back strongly after falling to
two-week lows Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, advancing on
changing weather forecasts. Grains also rose.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans initially slid for a second straight day on predictions
of more showers this weekend in the Midwest. But prices found
resistance and commodity funds began a buying surge after some
private forecasts scaled back expected rainfall totals for this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The increase was limited by the off-and-on rainy outlook for
soybean growing areas, including southeastern states.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat climbed sharply higher in sympathy with soybeans.
Market-watchers said the forecasts for a drier weekend in the
central United States supported the increase.
</P>
<P>
   Corn also rose after falling for the previous seven sessions.
Traders said the mild rally was a response to a decline deemed
overdone.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for July delivery rose 3{ cents to $2.68\ a bushel; May
corn rose 2\ cents to $2.34 a bushel; July oats rose } cent to
$1.19 a bushel; May soybeans rose 9{ cents to $5.37{ a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Beef futures were lower on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
while pork futures were sharply higher.
</P>
<P>
   June live cattle fell .12 cent to 69.15 cents a pound; May
feeder cattle fell .23 cent to 84.52 cents a pound; June lean hogs
rose 1.70 cent to 75.07 cents a pound; May pork bellies rose the
limit 3 cents to 95.67 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> U.K.'s Thomson Travel Rejects Offer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Thomson Travel PLC, Britain's biggest chartered
tour operator, on Wednesday rejected a sweetened buyout offer of
$2.32 billion in cash from Germany's C&AMP;N Touristic AG.
</P>
<P>
   C&AMP;N's latest offer of $2.32 a share was made on condition that
the Thomson board recommend the deal to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomson said the price ''would not reflect the value of the
business and its prospects'' under a company-wide review that aims
to cut annual costs by at least $80 million and invest in new
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ''Accordingly, if such an offer were to be made, the board would
unanimously recommend shareholders to reject it,'' the company said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate reaction from C&AMP;N, a joint venture
between Kardstadt-Quelle AG and Deutsche Lufthansa AG. It says
Thomson's poor financial performance has placed it in a vulnerable
position.
</P>
<P>
   On April 5, Thomson turned down a cash offer from C&AMP;N of $2.08
per share that would value the British company at $2.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson, founded in 1965 and one of the first tour groups to fly
large numbers of Britons to Mediterranean resorts, issued three
profit warnings last year, the most recent because of poor sales
related to millennium New Year's holidays.
</P>
<P>
   C&AMP;N, Europe's third-largest tour business, is eager to gain a
foothold in Britain, where it currently has no presence. It
increased its holding of Thomson stock to 4.8 percent at the time
of the earlier bid, up from 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The German company was formed from a merger in 1998 of
Lufthansa's charter airline Condor Flugdienst GmbH and Karstadt
Quelle's tour operator NUR Touristic GmbH.

<HEADLINE> Sheppard Jury Deliberations Begin  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN AFFLECK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- The question of whether Dr. Sam Sheppard killed
his wife in 1954 has gone to a jury for the third and probably
final time.
</P>
<P>
   A Cuyahoga County jury began deliberations Wednesday in a
lawsuit filed through the doctor's estate by his son, Sam Reese
Sheppard, against the state of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Their son claims Dr. Sam Sheppard was wrongfully imprisoned for
the slaying of his wife, Marilyn, at the family's upscale home on
Lake Erie on July 4, 1954.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor spent almost 10 years behind bars. The U.S. Supreme
Court overturned the murder verdict in a groundbreaking ruling on
the effects of negative pretrial publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Acquitted at retrial in 1966, the doctor died of liver failure
four years later, at age 46.
</P>
<P>
   The case later inspired ''The Fugitive'' TV series and movie.
</P>
<P>
   In the current case, Sheppard must convince at least six of
eight jurors that the greater weight of the evidence shows his
father was innocent. If the jury rules in his favor, Sheppard can
seek monetary damages.
</P>
<P>
   During closing arguments Tuesday, Sheppard attorney Terry
Gilbert said DNA and other forensic evidence clears the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert said the doctor never wavered from his account of wife's
death: that he was sleeping downstairs at the time of the murder,
heard his wife's cries and ran to help her but was knocked
unconscious by a bushy-haired intruder.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors, who are defending the state, portrayed the
doctor as an adulterous husband who killed his wife in a fit of
rage.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Off 286; Dow Off 161  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index continued its steep
slide today, plummeting 286 points and closing below 4,000 for the
first time since Jan. 31. Microsoft led the decline after a Goldman
Sachs analyst lowered his revenue estimate for the last quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's woes sent a chill through the entire technology
sector and demolished an early rally by the Dow Jones industrial
average.
</P>
<P>
   the Nasdaq composite index fell 286.69 to 3,769.21, its second
worst point drop in history. The 7.1 percent decline was the sixth
worst in percentage terms.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq is now down 7.4 percent in the year to date, having
given back all of the 24 percent gain it had achieved as of March
10.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow fell 161.95 to 11,125.13. The blue-chip index spent most
of the day in positive territory as financial stocks soared.
Traders said the Dow stocks faltered as investors scrambled to
raise cash in case the Nasdaq's steep drop spurs a new round of
margin calls in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 33.40 to 1,467.19.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,527 up, 1,480 down and 451
unchanged. On the Nasdaq, decliners led advancers by a 10-to-3
margin.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 1.14 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 967.16
million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 15.28 to
494.85.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which has already seen its market value plunge as it
fights antitrust charges, fell sharply. This morning, Goldman Sachs
analyst Rick Sherlund cut his revenue estimate for the company's
fiscal third quarter to $5.75 billion from $5.95 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sherlund said in a research note that personal computer sales
during the quarter appear to have missed Goldman Sachs's earlier
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a further negative for sentiment in a poor tech
market,'' Sherlund said. Computer makers slumped on the news; Dell,
IBM and Hewlett-Packard were all lower.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's drop provided the latest catalyst for the ongoing
decline of the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   ''If investors think there's a prick in the bubble, that gives
them a reason to get out of some stocks that are making them
nervous anyway,'' said Robert M. Balentine, chief executive officer
of investment advisory firm Balentine &AMP; Co. in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The index, which set a closing record of 5,048.62 on March 10,
has tumbled 25 percent since then, and is now down more than 4
percent in the year to date.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's decline accelerated last week, when the index fell
more than 400 points over the course of two wildly volatile
sessions. Last week, with many unproven, more speculative
technology stocks spiraling lower, some investment brokerages
demanded that investors put up cash to cover stocks that were
bought on margin -- with money borrowed from the brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   Those ''margin calls'' may have come into play today, traders
said, exacerbating the selloff.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts remain divided on whether the Nasdaq is headed back
toward last week's low point of about 3,650 or poised for a round
of bargain-hunting. Balentine, for one, believes that the
technology selloff has not yet run its course.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will hurt the day trader, and the person who lost all
their diversification in favor of an all-technology portfolio,'' he
said. ''But these stocks had so far to fall that you've still got
to believe that this is healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, analysts say, the volatility has brought some
welcome skepticism to the technology market, ending the frenzy for
any stock tied to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''Investors will be more discriminating in their buying of
technology and Internet stocks,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, chief
market strategist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings reports continued to provide some enticement to buy.
Enron rose after reporting first-quarter earnings of 40 cents a
share. Analysts had anticipated earnings of 37 cents a share. The
strong report confirmed expectations that energy companies will
show the sharpest profit growth for the recently ended quarter.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan rose. The investment bank easily exceeded Wall
Street's earnings estimates, posting first-quarter profits of $3.37
a share. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had
anticipated earnings of $2.81 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Other financial stocks, including American Express, rose amid
expectations that they, too, will report strong earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Clorox rose after the company secured an arrangement with online
grocer Webvan to sell its products over the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Gore Wants Bush's Plans Scrutinized  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The day after Republican George W. Bush jumped
into the health care debate, Democrat Al Gore accused his rival of
''political malpractice'' and prodded newspaper editors to give
Bush's proposals a close examination.
</P>
<P>
   ''I worked in journalism long enough to know that some claims
demand serious scrutiny,'' Gore told the annual conference of the
American Society of Newspaper Editors. Just out of the Army, Gore
worked for The Tennessean in Nashville in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic presidential candidate also addressed, in
response to one editor's question, the possibility that the
independent counsel investigation into Whitewater and the Monica
Lewinsky affair could yet yield criminal indictments against
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   If elected, would Gore consider a presidential pardon for his
partner of eight years?
</P>
<P>
   ''President Clinton is way ahead of you on this. He said
publicly some time ago that he would neither request nor accept a
pardon, so that's the answer to that question,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke the day after Bush, the Texas governor and GOP
presidential candidate, proposed tax credits to help working people
buy health insurance. Bush's health plan came after an
environmental speech and emphasis on an education initiative -- all
designed to encroach on issues where Gore believed the upper hand
was his.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ''wants us to believe he's committed to issues like
education, health care and the environment,'' Gore said today.
''Let's face it. The Bush approach on these issues is a headline
without a story.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore continued: ''The hundreds of thousands of uninsured
children and families in his own state of Texas who have no health
insurance ... do not have it because of the political malpractice
of the Bush administration.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president said he would accept a presidential-debate
invitation from any newspaper editor in the conference room. An
editor from Vancouver, Wash., immediately invited him. ''I
accept,'' Gore said, adding that it was up to the newspaper to get
Bush to accept as well.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has pressed for debates early in the campaign season. Bush
has said there will be plenty of time in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor, asked today in St. Louis for a response to
Gore's new criticism, said, ''Not right now, thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer defended the governor's record,
saying he had presided over improvements in Texas health care and
signed a patients' bill of rights. A significant piece of that
legislation, giving patients the right the sue insurance companies,
became law without his signature.
</P>
<P>
   ''The worse Al Gore is doing in the polls, the more he attacks
and misrepresents the governor's record,'' said Fleischer. ''Pretty
soon, Al Gore will say he invented health care.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore had gentler words for families affected by the Columbine
school shootings, who say last April's tragedy should qualify as a
disaster whose victims are eligible for compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would certainly have a positive feeling about that,'' Gore
said, noting that Clinton was in Denver today and planned to meet
with some of the families.
</P>
<P>
   From one hotel conference room, Gore headed to another where he
and fund-raising pro Terry McAuliffe joined forces to light a fire
under the two dozen prominent Democrats working on the May 24
Washington gala starring Clinton and Gore. McAuliffe put the
fund-raising goal for that bluejeans-and-barbecue evening at $7
million.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also held forth at a small, $500,000 luncheon for the
Democratic National Committee at the Washington home of former New
York Rep. Tom Downey, now a government consultant whose clients
include Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's ongoing solicitation for the Democrats included a $1
million dinner Tuesday night, $3.5 million in appearances last week
and a packed weekend of fund-raisers coming up.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, he is entertaining Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura at a
private dinner at the vice presidential residence.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Gore and Ventura said their meeting would be as much a
social opportunity for them and their wives as a chance to talk
issues. A coveted endorsement by Ventura, the nation's best-known
independent officeholder, was not in the works for today, the aides
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just won't happen,'' said Ventura spokesman John Wodele.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner with Ventura, Gore was headed to Charlotte, N.C.,
to make good on a rain check to Marie G. Davis Middle School when
he canceled a visit last week to be in Washington with a sick
friend.
</P>
<P>
   The eight hours he planned to spend Thursday immersed in the
school's routine follow his school day Tuesday at Avondale
Elementary in Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when opposition to the state's mandated proficiency
tests is growing, the Democratic presidential candidate said he
supported such tests as a way ''to measure the performance of the
students'' and ''a fair and accurate way to get a measurement of
how the schools are doing.''

<HEADLINE> Corporate America Taps Gay Market  </HEADLINE>
By MARTHA IRVINE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A decade ago, the list of mainstream advertisers
willing to court the gay and lesbian market had only a few names --
Subaru, Absolut vodka and American Airlines among them.
</P>
<P>
   These days, corporate America is increasingly willing to risk
boycotts from religious conservatives to gain favor with what many
believe is a lucrative market. Some of the more recent companies to
target gay and lesbian consumers include retailers Office Max and
Neiman Marcus, Alamo rental cars and Hartford Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a mainstreaming phenomenon going on,'' says Stephanie
K. Blackwood, a partner in Spare Parts Inc., a New York-based
company that helps companies market to gays. ''The fear is eroding
faster than I ever thought imaginable.''
</P>
<P>
   Opening minds and easing comfort levels aside, experts say the
Internet is also helping the trend along by making it easier for
advertisers to target consumers who frequent gay Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The sites are proving to be popular because they allow even
closeted gay people to socialize, check information archives and
even shop ''without fear of repercussions from the guy at the
hardware store, the guy at the bank or even the people they see at
church on Sunday,'' says Jeffrey Newman, chief operating officer of
gfn.com, the Gay Financial Network, a new investing Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ''Someone once said that the Internet is the best place to be
openly closeted,'' Newman says.
</P>
<P>
   While many Web sites track the surfing habits of their customers
and share the information with marketers, users of gay oriented Web
sites are afforded a higher measure of privacy because most of
these sites refuse to share such data.
</P>
<P>
   Early statistics on the use of gay oriented sites show a trend
that advertisers like.
</P>
<P>
   The two leading sites, Gay.com and PlanetOut, attracted more
than 700,000 people, combined, in February, according to Media
Metrix, a research firm that tracks Internet usage. Gay.com says
its own research puts its monthly visitor count in the millions.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the Advocate -- a leading twice-monthly national
gay magazine -- has a total paid circulation of about 86,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the gay and lesbian world, you've never been able to reach
100,000 at one time,'' says Lowell Selvin, CEO of Online Partners,
the parent company of San Francisco-based Gay.com. ''The reach and
ability to target a mass audience has changed dramatically -- and
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an audience that while sometimes difficult to quantify,
appears to be well worth finding for advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Recent surveys conducted by Greenfield Online, a
Connecticut-based Internet research company, found that the average
annual household income for gays and lesbians is $57,000, compared
with an overall household average of $53,000. Spare Parts estimates
there are 15 million to 23 million lesbians and gay men nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The income and Web numbers have been enough to get the attention
of Cleveland-based Office Max, which is hoping gay consumers will
click on its ad on Gay.com and order office supplies.
</P>
<P>
   That the consumers might be gay is secondary, says Office Max
spokesman Steve Baisden.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're here to serve our customers,'' he says. ''We don't care
whether they're white, black, yellow, gay or lesbian.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say advertisers are also noting that companies that took
early chances -- American Airlines, for example, established a gay
marketing division in 1994 -- not only survived boycotts but gained
considerable market share.
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment and an increasing comfort with gay issues in
general has even caused some members of the religious right to
throw up their hands, says Bob Witeck, another marketer who helps
companies reach gay consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many people -- even deeply conservative people -- will say,
'It's just business,''' says Witeck, partner in Washington-based
Witeck-Combs Communications, whose clients include Coors Brewing
Co. and American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Such an atmosphere of comfort has seen Subaru using lesbian
tennis star Martina Navratilova as a spokeswoman in one of its
latest mainstream TV ads. ''Who says girls don't know about cars?''
Navratilova says as she turns to the camera with a sly smile.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while many companies are advertising to gays, many prefer
to keep their intentions in the closet.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Wilke, a gay marketing and media historian based in New
York, says he's often gotten the cold shoulder when trying to get
companies to talk about the campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ''It shows that companies are willing to do this,'' Wilke says.
''But they're still not fully comfortable with it.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Encouraging Stock Options  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal labor laws would be streamlined to
clear the way for hourly employees to receive stock options and
gain a stake in the nation's prosperity, senators said Wednesday in
passing the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ''This bill simply says it makes no difference if you work in
the corporate boardroom or on the factory floor. Everyone should be
able to share in the success of the company,'' said Sen. Mitch
McConnell, R-Ky., the bill's sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials last year realized that under the 1938 Fair
Labor Standards Act, an hourly employee's stock options must be
counted as part of his base pay when calculating overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The business community, as well as lawmakers, were concerned
that the exorbitant costs involved would force employers to
eliminate stock options for hourly workers but not salaried
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's bill, which passed 95-0, exempts stock option gains
from overtime pay. Stock options would be treated as an employee
benefit and could not be used in lieu of a worker's regular salary
or used in calculating overtime compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., said the measure was a ''symbolic
first step in the process of aligning our labor laws with the new
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar bill is pending in a House committee. Labor Secretary
Alexis Herman, whose agency helped draft the legislation, has said
she will recommend that President Clinton sign the bill if it
passes.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is S. 2323 and H.R. 4109

<HEADLINE> Gore: Media Should Test Bush  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fighting encroachment on his signature issues,
Vice President Al Gore accused Republican George W. Bush Wednesday
of ''political malpractice'' on health insurance in Texas and
prodded newspapers ''to challenge every assumption and question
every proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Gore also addressed the possibility that as president
he might pardon Bill Clinton should the independent counsel's
Monica Lewinsky investigation yield criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that at a conference of the American Society of
Newspaper Editors, Gore said: ''President Clinton is way ahead of
you on this. He said publicly some time ago that he would neither
request nor accept a pardon, so that's the answer to that
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Texas governor, pushed forward Wednesday in his
efforts on education, the environment and health care, adding to
his day-old health plan a $4.3 billion proposal to expand community
and migrant health centers in underserved areas.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our society resolved long ago to provide a safety net for
those in the most desperate circumstances,'' said Bush, campaigning
in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Gore scorned his Republican presidential rival as a
johnny-come-lately, citing news reports that Bush's Tuesday
announcement -- proposed tax credits to help working people buy
health insurance -- was his first-ever speech on health care.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hundreds of thousands of uninsured children and families
in his own state of Texas who have no health insurance ... do not
have it because of the political malpractice of the Bush
administration,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's back-to-back health proposals followed his recent
environmental and education initiatives -- all areas in which Gore
had believed he could dominate the debate. While public opinion
polls show voters tend to trust Democrats on these issues more than
Republicans, the Gore camp is nervous that Bush could gain ground
with his latest policy drive.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wants us to believe he's committed to issues like
education, health care and the environment,'' Gore told the
editors.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need the nation's reporters and editors to challenge every
assumption and question every proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer defended the governor's record,
saying he had presided over improvements in Texas health care and
signed a patients' bill of rights. A significant piece of that
legislation, giving patients the right the sue insurance companies,
became law without his signature.
</P>
<P>
   ''The worse Al Gore is doing in the polls, the more he attacks
and misrepresents the governor's record,'' said Fleischer. ''Pretty
soon, Al Gore will say he invented health care.''
</P>
<P>
   On another matter, Gore was asked by a Rocky Mountain News
editor about families harmed by the Columbine school shootings, who
say last April's tragedy should qualify them for disaster
compensation from the Colorado and federal governments.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this is still a pending issue on January the 20th of next
year, I would certainly look with great sympathy in a positive way
toward whatever these families are asking,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Later Wednesday, Gore met with two dozen prominent Democratic
fund- raisers working on the May 24 Washington gala starring
Clinton and Gore. Organizer Terry McAuliffe put the fund-raising
goal for that bluejeans-and-barbecue evening at $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also held forth at a small, $500,000 luncheon for the
Democratic National Committee at the Washington home of former New
York Rep. Tom Downey, now a government consultant whose clients
include Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president held to his pledge to keep unregulated ''soft
money'' issue ads off the air, but only until the Republicans dip
into their soft money funds for such ads.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will fight fire with fire,'' Gore told contributors who
paid $25,000 apiece for the lunch. ''I appreciate you all being a
part of this event to make sure that we have the ability to win
that battle if and when it comes in that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Dinner was with Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura at the vice
presidential residence.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Gore and Ventura described it as a chance to get better
acquainted and talk issues -- not negotiate an endorsement by
Ventura, the nation's best-known independent officeholder.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just won't happen,'' said Ventura spokesman John Wodele.
</P>
<P>
   Still, happy to have himself pictured with Ventura, Gore invited
one news photographer to cover the get-together.

<HEADLINE> Federal judge approves state changes to Megan's Law  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A federal judge who once threatened to stop
sex offender notifications now says the state attorney general has
a ''reasonable method'' for distributing the community warnings
allowed by Megan's Law.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Joseph Irenas ended the latest
challenge to the law Wednesday by approving the state plan
requiring people who get such notices to sign promises not to
discuss the information.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Irenas said the notification guidelines were
unconstitutional, in part because authorities routinely allowed
details about sex offenders to go far beyond court-ordered bounds.
He allowed the notifications to continue while the matter was
appealed by the state public defenders office, representing sex
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   That ruling prompted supporters -- including Maureen Kanka, whose
daughter's rape and murder gave birth to Megan's Law -- to push for
a change in the state constitution. They want an amendment to
broaden the law and allow legislators legal room to put details
about sex offenders on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The state public defender tried to convince Irenas that by
including a sex offender's street address in the packet of
information distributed, the state violated the felon's privacy
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Those who do not sign the waiver will not be given the
offender's exact address, the judge said. And others, like school
employees and business owners, only will see notices that do not
include the address.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mandate this court issued to defendants was not to create
a perfect system, but one reasonably calculated to get the
information to those with a 'particular need for it' while
avoiding'' those who do not need it, Irenas wrote.
</P>
<P>
   A warning notice with the ''general area'' where a sex offender
lives is not ''information of an extremely personal or private
nature,'' he said. And ''in today's world'' many people have access
to once-private information like home addresses, the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In most cases, a person with the inclination and Internet
access can discover another's home address without great effort,''
Irenas said. If he declared such avenues to information off-limits,
''very little information would be free from constitutional
protection,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General John J. Farmer Jr. said he is ''gratified'' by
the decision, especially since the judge ''recognized we weren't
pandering to any special interest group'' with the revised
guidelines. The office chose to issue the new guidelines rather
than appeal the January ruling, Farmer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It strikes a balance. That's what we tried to do and that's
what the judge recognized,'' Farmer said.
</P>
<P>
   The public defender is reviewing the decision, spokesman Jeff
Beach said in a prepared statement. The sex offenders the office
represents ''have expressed their disappointment in Judge Irenas'
ruling and we are weighing the options on how to proceed,'' Beach
said.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's law categorizes convicted sex offenders into three
levels, based on the perceived threat the felons present. For those
labeled most at risk of committing another crime, the law allows
prosecutors to provide an offender's name, address and photo to
residents living in a carefully defined area. All offenders are
required to register with police, once out of prison.
</P>
<P>
   Megan's Law is named for Megan Kanka, a 7-year-old Hamilton
Township girl who was raped and murdered in July 1994 by a
convicted sex offender who lived across the street from her Mercer
County home.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Money for National Lakes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House on Wednesday approved $250 million
in grants over five years to help states clean up the nation's
lakes. It separately authorized a six-year $180 million program to
continue Chesapeake Bay restoration work.
</P>
<P>
   The clean lakes bill, sponsored by Rep. John Sweeney, R-N.Y.,
would put new life in a program that has fallen out of use in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The program was a provision of the 1972 Clean Water Act, but the
Environmental Protection Agency has not sought funding in recent
years, asking states to use money from other pollution programs to
clean up their lakes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to have a national program because certainly acid rain
is something that crosses state lines,'' Transportation Committee
Chairman Bud Shuster, R-Pa., said.
</P>
<P>
   The House action said Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., ''will
send a clear message that we care about restoring and protecting
our nation's 41 million acres of freshwater lakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also increases from $15 million to $25 million a
year money available for the study of acid rain effects on lakes.
It adds four lakes -- Otsego and Oneida in New York, Raystown in
Pennsylvania and Swan in Minneapolis -- to a demonstration project
list receiving priority funding.
</P>
<P>
   The second bill approves $30 million a year to continue the
Chesapeake Bay Program, run by the EPA with the cooperation of the
states of Virginia, Pennsylvania and Maryland and the District of
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   It creates a new office within the EPA dedicated to implementing
efforts to restore the waters and the wildlife of the 64,000 square
mile watershed.
</P>
<P>
   The clean lakes bill passed 420-5 and the Chesapeake Bay bill
418-7. Both need Senate action.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The Clean Lakes bill number is H.R. 2328
</P>
<P>
   The Chesapeake Bay bill is H.R. 3039.

<HEADLINE> D.C. Braces for World Bank Protests  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Police lined bridges and kept the public away
from World Bank headquarters on Wednesday as a tense capital braced
for demonstrators, young and old, who want to protest policies of
international lending institutions toward poor nations.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of demonstrators were being given intense training in
nonviolent tactics, including ways to form a human chain that is
difficult to break without using pepper spray or tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   Trainees were asked to pledge they would avoid the violence that
marred last year's demonstrations in Seattle against the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the protesters didn't hide their intention of
disrupting the Sunday and Monday spring meetings of the lending
institutions, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   And neither the demonstrators nor the police knew what to expect
from fringe groups.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, strong feelings against debt repayment conditions
for poor nations shared attention with thousands of union members
who rallied against President Clinton's plan to give permanent
normal trade status to China.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our workers are forced to compete with prison labor and sweat
shop workers making as little as 13 cents and hour,'' said AFL-CIO
President John Sweeney. ''And while we are losing hundreds of
thousands of jobs, China is setting new records for the violation
of human rights and polluting the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Teamster President James P. Hoffa pledged to mobilize union
members ''to keep jobs in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The IMF-World Bank protesters believe those institutions impose
severe penalties on the poor countries they help with loans and
economic bailouts. The demonstrators say the countries must devote
so much to debt repayment that there's nothing left for desperately
needed social programs.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions have a separate complaint -- that the IMF and World
Bank do nothing about sweatshops. And environmental groups contend
the funding of big dams and mineral exploration devastate the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   World Bank President James Wolfensohn admitted the protests have
deeply affected him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a bit demoralizing when you see that there is a
mobilization for social justice when we think that is what we are
doing every day,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the demonstrators are in their 20s and 30s, but not all.
Barbara Dean, a grandmother from Sacramento, Calif. never
participated in a protest before she headed to Seattle last
December and experienced the burning sensation of tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   This week, she sat in a shabby warehouse in the nation's
capital, listening to a trainer on nonviolence prepare her for her
second demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   The District of Columbia police force has received special riot
training and has spent more than $1 million on new helmets, shin
guards and glove guards to protect officers. Some officers will
have shotguns capable of firing rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Police selected places where protesters could be temporarily
detained, and officers were scheduled for 12-hour shifts. Federal
police forces added officers to assist the city. Police lined
bridges into Washington to ease traffic flow, since some downtown
streets were closed.
</P>
<P>
   Like the police, the demonstrators have been training. Cathie
Berrey, of Asheville, N.C., taught protesters how to form human
chains by using ''lock boxes'' -- tubes where two people can insert
hands at either end.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteer lawyers lectured demonstrators on their legal rights.
The attorneys said they will represent those arrested providing
they abide by the pledge of nonviolence.
</P>
<P>
   The warehouse where protesters were trained is temporarily the
workspace of the Mobilization for Global Justice, a coalition of
dozens of organizations that have joined the protest. Besides the
training sessions, many kept busy building puppets for the
demonstration, painting banners, making signs and attending
workshops on issues such as sweatshops and environmental
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Ross, 65, a businesswoman who lives in Washington's
Maryland suburbs, was cutting cardboard boxes to make puppets. She
is a lifelong puppeteer and has often volunteered her expertise for
demonstrations -- the last time in protest of the NATO bombing of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Austria who fled the Nazis as a teen-ager, Ross said
she believes poor countries suffer discrimination just like she
experienced personally in World War II., ''I know what it's like to
be discriminated against. It's a very personal connection,'' she
said.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index continued its steep
slide today, plummeting 286 points and closing below 4,000 for the
first time since Jan. 31. Microsoft led the decline after a Goldman
Sachs analyst lowered his revenue estimate for the last quarter.
Microsoft's woes sent a chill through the entire technology sector
and demolished an early rally by the Dow Jones industrial average.
The Nasdaq composite index fell 286.69 to 3,769.21, its second
worst point drop in history. The 7.1 percent decline was the sixth
worst in percentage terms. The Dow Jones industrial average fell

consulting firm predicted in a report that fired another blow to
the battered online shopping industry. Intense competition combined

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Leading media conglomerate Time Warner Inc.

still posted a net loss for the first quarter due mainly to a
write-down in the troubled music retailer Columbia House. Time
Warner reported a net loss of $101 million, or 8 cents per share,
for the three months ended March 31. Excluding the $220 million
charge for Columbia House, a $46 million charge related to its
pending acquisition by America Online Inc. and gains of $28 million
on sales of cable systems, the company earned 5 cents per share,
beating analysts' estimates of 2 cents per share.

Jones earned $79.2 million during the three months ended March 31,

share. Including the gain from selling Dow Jones Financial
Publishing Corp., the company had net earnings of $88.7 million, or

   IMF Releases Optimistic Forecast
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The world economy, after being staggered by a
global financial crisis, regained its footing in 1999 and will grow
this year at 4.2 percent, the fastest pace in more than a decade,
the International Monetary Fund forecast today. It also expects
growth to continue sill-strong 3.9 percent in 2001. The IMF also
revised its estimate last year's growth to 3.3 percent, up sharply
from the 1998 figure of 2.5 percent. But the IMF also cautioned
that a sudden plunge in the U.S. stock market and a ''hard
landing'' for the U.S. economy could be risks to its forecast.

   Anti-Globalization Groups Protest

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Anti-globalization groups, hoping to repeat
the success they had in disrupting the World Trade Organization
meetings last year in Seattle, are staging a protest rally at the
U.S. Capitol today in advance of the IMF and World Bank meetings.
The AFL-CIO hoped to attract 10,000 demonstrators against one of
the Clinton administration's top priorities, granting China
permanent normal trade relations. Thousands of union members have
rallied at the Capitol and lobbied lawmakers to protest a bill that
would give permanent normal trade status to China instead of annual
reviews.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The post office, reflecting the growth of its

from www.usps.gov to www.usps.com. Addresses that end in ''gov''
are generally used by government agencies, and the Postal Service
is a semi-independent part of the government. But it is expected to
pay its own way and engages in many commercial activities including
sales of stamps and stamp-related merchandise as well as its newly
launched electronic bill paying service. So the decision was made
to switch, said Norman Cloher, manager of online services.

   Ben &AMP; Jerry Being Bought by Unilever
</P>
<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- Multinational giant Unilever PLC. is
buying Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade, the ice-cream maker founded by two
former hippies and known for its social activism, and Slim-Fast
Foods Co., a privately owned Florida outfit that makes nutritional
supplements and food for people who want to lose weight. Today's
Ben &AMP; Jerry's deal follows an effort by a group led by one of the
company's co-founders, Ben Cohen, to take the company private.
Unilever is to pay $43.60 per share to buy the Vermont-based
company that has carefully honed a tie-dyed, anti-corporate image
in its two decades of existence. That would be a nearly 25 percent
premium over Ben &AMP; Jerry's closing price Tuesday of $34.93}.

   Moves in Aluminum Merger

   PARIS (AP) -- French aluminum group Pechiney, which has planned
to merge with Canada's Alcan Aluminum and Switzerland's Algroup,
said today that the companies plan to file a revised merger plan
with the European Commission by April 30 or will abandon the
three-way plans. If the merger goes through, the new company would
be the world's largest aluminum producer, with a market
capitalization of $19 billion and revenue of $17.4 billion. The
three companies are trying to renegotiate a linkup that would
satisfy European antitrust regulators who rejected a merger between
Alcan and Pechiney last month. The commission said the merger would
have created ''dominant positions in a number of markets.'' It
already has approved a deal between Alcan and Algroup.

billion in cash from Germany's C&AMP;N Touristic AG. C&AMP;N's latest offer
of $2.32 a share was made on condition that the Thomson board
recommend the deal to shareholders. But Thomson said the price
''would not reflect the value of the business and its prospects''
under a company-wide review that aims to cut annual costs by at
least $80 million and invest in new technology.

<HEADLINE> Spider-Man Creator Signs With D.C.  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It's the comic book equivalent of Coke
executives joining the Pepsi Generation.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Lee, the legendary Marvel Comics guru and creator of
Spider-Man and The Hulk, has signed on to work with his former
arch-enemies at D.C. Comics. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ''How could I say no?'' Lee asked Wednesday from his California
office. ''What a kick this is. And even if I fall on my face, I
think people will get a kick out of this.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course, I hope I don't fall on my face.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the arrangement, Lee will be allowed to recreate the lives
and times of DC's most recognizable characters. Will Superman make
it from Krypton to Metropolis? Will Batman find his Robin? What of
Wonder Woman?
</P>
<P>
   It's all up to Lee, who says the only boundary is his
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every kid who has ever picked up one of his comics wondered
what Stan would do if he ever worked on the DC heroes,'' said Paul
Levitz, executive vice president and publisher of DC Comics. ''And
now we can deliver their dream.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger, once unthinkable, became possible in 1998 when
Marvel emerged from bankruptcy. Lee's exclusive contract was voided
and replaced with a lifetime deal requiring him to spend just 10
percent of his time with the company.
</P>
<P>
   So when DC approached with their proposal for ''Just Imagine
Stan Lee Creating ...'', he jumped at the chance.
</P>
<P>
   ''The beautiful thing about it is that I start from ground
zero,'' Lee said. ''The toughest thing is deciding, 'How would I do
this?' It's almost like I'm somebody else thinking, 'How would Stan
Lee do this?'''
</P>
<P>
   Even better, he will work with some of the business' top
artists: longtime Marvel collaborator John Buscema, ''Watchmen''
illustrator Dave Gibbons, and Bruce Timm of the animated ''Batman''
and ''Superman'' animated television series.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 77, remains the comic book industry's pre-eminent figure,
even after 60 years in the business.
</P>
<P>
   The creator of Spider-Man, The Hulk and The X-Men, he is still
chairman emeritus of Marvel. His most recent endeavor is Stan Lee
Media; his stanleemedia.com website is home to his animated on-line
comic book, ''The 7th Portal.''
</P>
<P>
   The project is under a considerable amount of secrecy, but Lee
said he had already written his Wonder Woman piece and was halfway
through Superman.
</P>
<P>
   Any hints about what happens, Stan?
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have Superman coming from Krypton,'' he quickly
replied. ''If I was going to come up with any name for a planet, it
would probably be Lee-tron.''

<HEADLINE> House OKs Northeast Engery Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An energy bill approved by the House Wednesday
would help out small-scale drillers when oil prices drop too low
and set up a home heating oil reserve to assist the Northeast when
prices get too high.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which passed 416-5, would allow the Northeast to
create a reserve of 2 million barrels to deal with situations, such
as occurred this winter, when the tight oil market caused heating
oil prices to skyrocket.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is very important to those of us that live within a
region that does have, on an ongoing basis, the threat that we are
going to be cut off from that home heating oil supply,'' said Rep.
Edward Markey, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont independent Rep. Bernard Sanders, chief sponsor of the
Northeast reserve provision, said it was ''a major step forward in
our efforts to make sure that people are not forced to suffer
through large swings in heating oil prices during the winter.''
</P>
<P>
   The main objective of the legislation was to reauthorize a
program that allows the president, in times of energy crisis, to
withdraw oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a 600 million
barrel stockpile in Texas and Louisiana set aside by law for
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved a four-year extension of his authority to
draw from the reserve, which expired when the House failed to act
by March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Congress have urged President Clinton to tap the reserve
to slow the surge in oil prices the nation has seen in recent
months. The reserve, established during the OPEC production cuts of
1975, has been used only once, by President Bush during the 1991
Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Weygand, D-R.I., said the 2 million barrel Northeast
reserve, is ''hardly a drop in the bucket to what we really need.''
He said he hoped it could be increased to 3 or 4 million before
Congress finished work on the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   He said home heating oil inventory in the Northeast went from 4
million barrels in 1991 to 17 million barrels last year and then
back to 4.5 million barrels this year.
</P>
<P>
   The House also amended the legislation to give the Energy
secretary the discretion to purchase oil at $15 a barrel from
small-scale stripper wells when world oil prices drop below that
level. Oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve must now be purchased
from foreign sources, and the average cost of oil in the reserve
today is $27 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, chairman of the House Commerce energy
subcommittee, said that if the provision had been in effect two
years ago, when low prices were driving many small drillers out of
business, the nation today might have up to 1 million barrels a day
more in production.
</P>
<P>

   The bill number is H.R. 2884.

<HEADLINE> Panel Looks To Keep Elderly at Work  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- At age 61, Sherman Sorem faced an increasingly
common retirement dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   His company, Fisher Controls International, was downsizing and
offered him an early retirement buyout or a less-demanding,
lower-paying job.
</P>
<P>
   Sorem wanted to keep working, but it would have ultimately meant
a smaller pension, since, like most corporate retirement benefits,
his are based on earnings during the final few years of service.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said, 'No, you're not going to beat me out of that. I'll
take early retirement,''' said Sorem, now 65.
</P>
<P>
   Because Sorem has needed expertise, the company still asks him
to come back to work for a few weeks each year. But the
Marshalltown, Iowa, retiree and his wife Nancy, 62, wonder why
there wasn't a better way.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of labor shortages caused by the humming economy
and with a huge wave of baby boomers nearing retirement age,
Congress is beginning to wonder the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to make sure federal laws don't hurt older workers.
Our economy will depend on it,'' said Sen. Charles Grassley,
R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging.
</P>
<P>
   Already this year, Congress has repealed the Social Security
earnings limit, removing the threat of reduced federal retirement
benefits for those who continue to work past age 65. President
Clinton signed that legislation into law Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Now lawmakers are considering how to break down private-sector
barriers for older workers, such as outdated tax and pension laws
that often result in penalties against people who work past a
certain age. The aging committee explored options at a hearing last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Among ideas being considered are legislation that would make it
easier for companies to design phased pensions, allowing partial
collection of benefits starting at age 59{ by those who continue to
work part time.
</P>
<P>
   That's similar to rules governing 401(k) retirement savings
accounts, a newer employee benefit that is increasingly popular but
does not have the advantage of guaranteeing a continuous old-age
income, as pensions do.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the elderly say better age discrimination laws
also may be needed to ensure that older workers get equal
opportunities for training to keep up with changing technology.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of the time it is a subtle discrimination that occurs,''
said Joseph Perkins, president of the AARP, the nation's largest
organization of older adults.
</P>
<P>
   Like Social Security, many laws and attitudes shaping today's
retirement options developed around the time of the Great
Depression, when high unemployment made it desirable to encourage
older Americans to leave the work force.
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed. Now a thriving economy creating plentiful
jobs has many employers scrambling to hold on to workers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the huge baby boom generation has reached middle age.
Rising life expectancies mean many will live for decades past what
has been considered ''normal'' retirement age, between ages 60 and
65.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 13 percent of Americans currently aged 65 and older
work, according to AARP. But a 1998 AARP poll of baby boomers found
that eight in 10 intend to keep working at least part time in old
age -- because they think they will need extra cash, or for
pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Hy-Vee Inc., a supermarket chain with 210 stores across the
Midwest, is among companies taking steps to attract and keep older
workers.
</P>
<P>
   In help-wanted advertisements, Hy-Vee promises flexible
scheduling -- including three-season jobs, allowing for winters
spent in warmer climes. ''Your experience and maturity are assets
we find valuable to our success,'' the ads say.

<HEADLINE> Report: Medical Boards Overworked  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators are beginning steps to
increase the safety of thousands of people enrolled in medical
research, but the local medical boards primarily responsible for
such oversight remain overworked and undertrained, says a new
inspector general report.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest gaps: Once regulators agree to let a medical
experiment start, there is little independent monitoring of how
patients fare day-to-day, meaning early warning signs of risk may
be missed.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Health and Human Services' inspector general
first warned in 1998 that the protection system for Americans
enrolled in clinical trials was in jeopardy, and urged reforms to
better assure patient safety.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, ''minimal progress has been made,'' the inspector
general said in an update to that investigation released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The government has taken some steps to improve -- indeed, the
National Institutes of Health's Office of Protection from Research
Risks last year began more aggressively enforcing patient
protections. And the recent public outcry over the death of an
Arizona teen-ager in a gene therapy study should serve ''as a
catalyst'' for yet stronger protections, the report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Among the improvements the report cites:
</P>
<P>
   --Between April 1997 and May 1998, the OPRR had conducted an
on-site investigation of only one medical center, but between June
1998 and last month that number rose to 10. OPRR last year began
more aggressively enforcing safety regulations, and suspended
federally funded research at seven medical centers that broke such
rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are compelled to keep people who are in experiments out of
harm's way. Concern for the interests of the subject must always
prevail over the interests of science and society,'' OPRR chief Dr.
Gary Ellis said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   --The Food and Drug Administration has increased its on-site
safety investigations, from 213 in 1997 to 336 last year. The FDA
also now better informs medical oversight boards when it catches
scientists involved in misconduct, information those boards need to
judge the researchers' ongoing work.
</P>
<P>
   But federal regulators rely on local help in making sure that
people are properly informed of the risks of clinical trials and
that side effects are caught early. Institutional review boards, or
IRBs, at hospitals are supposed to do that job -- but that safety
net continues to be shaky, Wednesday's report says.
</P>
<P>
   Some IRBs are asked to approve 2,000 clinical trial designs
every year, in addition to overseeing whether ongoing studies harm
people. IRB members are so overworked that some have acknowledged
they don't even question the safety of an ongoing study unless
someone dies.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the inspector general recommended in 1998 that
many experiments be given an independent monitoring board to
oversee ongoing studies. Wednesday's report concluded that hasn't
happened.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in the nation's most high-profile clinical trial
tragedy -- the death of Jesse Gelsinger, 18, from a gene therapy
experiment -- the FDA found University of Pennsylvania researchers
failed to properly report side effects and had no outside monitors
to sound the warning, either.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA has now ordered that all gene therapy studies have
independent monitors. The new report urged extending that rule to
other medical experiments.
</P>
<P>
   The government also needs to better educate IRB members about
federal safety rules, and find ways to insulate these boards from
conflicts of interest -- a growing concern as more and more research
at hospitals and academic medical centers is funded by industry.

<HEADLINE> Army: Fighting in Senegal Kills 18  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAKAR, Senegal (AP) -- The army forced back secessionist rebels
attempting to cross into southern Senegal from Guinea-Bissau, the
military said late Tuesday. At least 18 people were killed in the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Heavily armed rebels crossed into the southern enclave of
Casamance early Tuesday and attacked army positions in the frontier
village of Sara Wali, the military said in a statement late that
day.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels were forced back over the border in heavy fighting,
the statement said. Three government soldiers and 15 rebels were
killed, according to the military, which did not say how many
people were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's assault took Senegal by surprise. President Abdoulaye
Wade has made peace in Casamance a priority of his new government,
and rebel leader Rev. Diamacoune Senghor has said his election
could lead to a breakthrough in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are fighting for autonomy in Casamance, which is
separated from most of the rest of this West African country by
Gambia. More than 1,200 people have been killed since the rebellion
began in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, who reportedly receive military aid from
Guinea-Bissau, claim Casamance was never colonized by the French as
part of Senegal and so should remain independent. France disputes
the claim.
</P>
<P>
   Wade's election last month ended the 40-year rule of the
Socialist Party, which has governed since independence from France
in 1960.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Offers Drug Coverage Plan  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans sketched the outlines
Wednesday of legislation to offer partially subsidized prescription
drug insurance to senior citizens, but Democrats swiftly criticized
the effort as election-year posturing.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert unveiled the GOP proposal with
fanfare on a ceremony on the Capitol steps, where he said that
Medicare beneficiaries who ''choose this voluntary plan will never
have to pay retail prices for their prescription drugs again.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, R-Ill., also pledged to ''work with the president to
modernize our Medicare system with a common-sense prescription drug
plan.'' The proposal envisions a new private insurance market, with
government subsidies for lower income seniors as well as those with
unusually high prescription drug costs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton outlined a different plan in his State of the Union
Address in January, one that would make prescription coverage a new
benefit under the federal Medicare program. Many Democrats support
the administration's approach, and the party's leader in the House,
Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, noted the Republicans waited
''until the middle of an election year'' to launch their effort.
</P>
<P>
   ''Like their effort on managed care reform, this is a sham
proposal that was designed to comfort the health insurance special
interests instead of providing real relief for health care
consumers,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt also said there is no guarantee that the private
insurance plans envisioned by the Republicans ''will be available
at all. And if private companies actually decide to write these
policies, there is no guarantee they will either be meaningful or
affordable for even low-income seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, Republican presidential contender George W. Bush has
said that he favors expanding Medicare options so senior citizens
have a choice among programs that would privately offer
prescription drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can give seniors more access to prescriptions through
choice and options,'' said Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer. He said
the Texas governor will be outlining further senior citizen health
issues ''in a short measure of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The insurance industry has argued previously that stand-alone
prescription drug policies would be unworkable and potentially very
expensive for consumers, and issued a statement that did little to
indicate a change in position.
</P>
<P>
   ''We continue to have concerns about private 'stand-alone' drug
coverage for seniors,'' said Chip Kahn, chairman of the Health
Insurance Association of America. He added, though, that the
proposal differs from earlier efforts, and said, ''We intend to
study it carefully before taking a position.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health
Plans, sounded a more positive note, saying the Republican
proposal, coupled with Clinton's plan, indicates a ''bipartisan
consensus has emerged'' on the need for a prescription drug
benefit. That alone, she said, will challenge the conventional
wisdom in Washington that ''big things don't happen in an election
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert told reporters he hopes to have legislation on the House
floor by summer.
</P>
<P>
   He said it would permit private insurance companies to offer
policies providing only prescription drug coverage to
Medicare-eligible Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker declined to discuss specific details, pending a
formal estimate of the cost by the Congressional Budget Office. He
said under the proposal, the government would pay the cost of the
insurance coverage for low-income seniors. It also would step in to
pay the cost for catastrophic prescription costs, a provision the
Republicans termed ''stop-loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Other officials familiar with the emerging plan, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the plan would offer a full subsidy
for all seniors at or below the government's poverty level, and
possibly as high as 135 percent of poverty. A partial subsidy would
be available to seniors with income as much as 150 percent of
poverty, they added.
</P>
<P>
   These sources added that Republicans were looking at a measure
that limits an individual's out of pocket costs to between $2,000
and $3,000 a year, and sets the ''stop-loss'' level -- the point
where the government steps in to bear the cost -- at between $9,000
and $10,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have set aside an additional $40 billion in
their budget for Medicare over the next five years. Hastert said
most of that would go toward the prescription drug program, but
some would be set aside to make basic medical care under Medicare
more accessible in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton's proposal, which would cost $195 billion over 10
years, Medicare would contract with the same drug benefit
management firms used by many private health plans.
</P>
<P>
   The coverage would be available as an option to all 39 million
Medicare beneficiaries. At first, Medicare would pay up to $1,000
in drug costs annually for a $26 monthly premium, with both the
benefit cap and premiums increasing over time.
</P>
<P>
   There would be no deductible, and beneficiaries would pay 50
percent out of pocket for each prescription. Under the president's
plan, the government would pay all costs for seniors with incomes
of up to 135 percent of the poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has earmarked $35 billion of the total cost of his plan
for extra coverage for those with the highest drug bills, but has
said details should be worked out with Congress.

<HEADLINE> Beefy British Farmers in Calendar  </HEADLINE>
By JILL LAWLESS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- It gives a whole new meaning to the term
''beefcake.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve British farmers have bared all in a calendar designed in
part to draw attention to the nation's beleaguered beef industry.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Meat British Beef'' calendar features a dozen farmers from
southwest Devon county in a variety of pastoral poses.
</P>
<P>
   A naked Mr. March smiles from the cab of his tractor, while Mr.
November, clad only in a cap and rubber boots, sits astride a
horse. Others preserve their modesty with strategically placed corn
stalks, cauliflower and bales of hay.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought it would be nice to draw attention to farmers in a
positive way -- and to show they've had the shirts taken off their
backs,'' said Nicola de Pulford, a Devon farmer and photographer
who took the pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The broad smiles of the models, who range in age from their late
20s to early 40s, mask the ailing state of Britain's farm sector.
Beef farmers have been clobbered by bans imposed by several
countries, including France, over concerns about bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, or ''mad cow'' disease.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the group's Web site can simultaneously order a
calendar and sign a petition calling for a ban on French produce
and for Prime Minister Tony Blair's government to do more to help
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are farming families who are desperately struggling,''
the farmer-photographer de Pulford said. ''A lot of livestock
farmers just feel they can't go on. Farmers don't want money from
the government. All they want is a fair price for the goods they
are selling.''
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds from the calendar project will go to a cooperative
formed by the participants and to a farmers' charity.
</P>
<P>
   The calendar has been a hit, selling 14,000 copies through mail
order since it was released in November and spawning a series of
personal appearances by the models -- including a ''Full
Monty''-style strip routine at a charity event.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tony Blair has said he wants farmers to diversify,'' de
Pulford said. ''What better kind of diversification is there?''

<HEADLINE> Judges' Ex-Wives Plan Federal Suit  </HEADLINE>
By REBECCA MAHONEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Caroline Douglas has complained for years
that she couldn't get a fair shake in her divorce case because her
ex-husband, former state Supreme Court Justice Chuck Douglas, knew
all the judges in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, Mrs. Douglas might get people to listen.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, a New Hampshire Supreme Court justice was
accused of trying to influence his colleagues in his own divorce
case. That has set off a crisis that threatens to bring down the
state's highest court.
</P>
<P>
   As for Mrs. Douglas, she and three other ex-wives of judges plan
to file a federal lawsuit alleging they were treated unfairly by
the legal system because of their husbands' connections.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think for a lot of reasons judges' wives have been quiet.
They didn't want to do anything because they understand what a big
obstacle it is. But they also understand that it is wrong,'' Mrs.
Douglas, a lawyer, told the Concord Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis erupted two weeks ago, when Supreme Court Justice
Stephen Thayer resigned after being accused of trying to intervene
in two cases in which he had an interest. Among other things, he
was accused of trying to influence the assignment of judges to hear
his divorce case.
</P>
<P>
   The state attorney general accused the entire court of routinely
letting justices comment on cases from which they had disqualified
themselves. On Thursday, the New Hampshire House is planning to
vote on whether to launch an investigation into possible
impeachable offenses involving three of the remaining four
justices.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Fran Wendelboe said the judges' ex-wives are not
alone. Several former wives of prominent lawyers have complained to
her about unfair treatment in their divorces, Wendelboe said, and
she has asked the House to investigate the divorces of other
judges.
</P>
<P>
   The women joining Mrs. Douglas in the lawsuit so far: Carolyn
D'Entremont Sullivan, who was married to Concord District Judge
Michael Sullivan; Betsy Millard, who was married to Superior Court
Judge Robert Morrill; and Kathleen Thornton, who was married to
Derry District Judge Edward Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   Thayer's divorce is still being appealed, so Judith Thayer does
not plan to join the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Judges Thornton, Millard and Sullivan seeking comment
Wednesday were not immediately returned. Chuck Douglas said, ''When
I see a suit, then I'll comment.''
</P>
<P>
   The ex-wives plan to argue they were unable to get competent
lawyers because of who their husbands were and knew. They also say
judges summarily dismissed their motions and sealed or sometimes
mysteriously reassigned the cases.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, they say, their husbands' high-powered lawyers got
judgments that left the wives with insufficient child support or no
health insurance, and even got Mrs. Douglas and Mrs. Thayer evicted
from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Douglas claimed from the outset that she could not get a
fair trial in New Hampshire, where her husband, a one-term
congressman, remains influential in Republican politics.
</P>
<P>
   She tried to have the trial moved to Vermont or another neutral
forum, but both the state and U.S. Supreme courts refused. Her U.S.
Supreme Court petition originally landed on the desk of Justice
David Souter, a former colleague of her husband's on the New
Hampshire Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton said her lawyer during her 1992 divorce failed to
research her husband's assets. She also discovered later that the
lawyer had argued cases before her husband a couple of weeks before
her divorce trial.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Scherr, an associate dean at Franklin Pierce Law Center
in Concord, said the ex-wives' case will be tough to prove.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not enough that they say they were discriminated against.
They're going to have to show they were, that if their former
spouses weren't judges, their divorces would have come out
differently,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I doubt they'll be able to get any judge to say, 'I helped my
fellow justice out because he's a buddy of mine.'''

<HEADLINE> House OKs Northeast Energy Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An energy bill approved by the House Wednesday
would help out small-scale drillers when oil prices drop too low
and set up a home heating oil reserve to assist the Northeast when
prices get too high.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which passed 416-5, would allow the Northeast to
create a reserve of 2 million barrels to deal with situations, such
as occurred this winter, when the tight oil market caused heating
oil prices to skyrocket.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is very important to those of us that live within a
region that does have, on an ongoing basis, the threat that we are
going to be cut off from that home heating oil supply,'' said Rep.
Edward Markey, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont independent Rep. Bernard Sanders, chief sponsor of the
Northeast reserve provision, said it was ''a major step forward in
our efforts to make sure that people are not forced to suffer
through large swings in heating oil prices during the winter.''
</P>
<P>
   The main objective of the legislation was to reauthorize a
program that allows the president, in times of energy crisis, to
withdraw oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a 600 million
barrel stockpile in Texas and Louisiana set aside by law for
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved a four-year extension of his authority to
draw from the reserve, which expired when the House failed to act
by March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Congress have urged President Clinton to tap the reserve
to slow the surge in oil prices the nation has seen in recent
months. The reserve, established during the OPEC production cuts of
1975, has been used only once, by President Bush during the 1991
Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Weygand, D-R.I., said the 2 million barrel Northeast
reserve, is ''hardly a drop in the bucket to what we really need.''
He said he hoped it could be increased to 3 or 4 million before
Congress finished work on the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   He said home heating oil inventory in the Northeast went from 4
million barrels in 1991 to 17 million barrels last year and then
back to 4.5 million barrels this year.
</P>
<P>
   The House also amended the legislation to give the Energy
secretary the discretion to purchase oil at $15 a barrel from
small-scale stripper wells when world oil prices drop below that
level. Oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve must now be purchased
from foreign sources, and the average cost of oil in the reserve
today is $27 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, chairman of the House Commerce energy
subcommittee, said that if the provision had been in effect two
years ago, when low prices were driving many small drillers out of
business, the nation today might have up to 1 million barrels a day
more in production.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is H.R. 2884.

<HEADLINE> Region Sets Telework Goals  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER ANDES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Telecommuting will work only if bosses accept
that real work is done at home, say leaders around the nation's
capital who hope the practice can help solve the area's traffic
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Many employers imagine the employee ''home in bunny slippers and
lounging in an easy chair with the kids running around,'' said Ada
Posey, a policy adviser with the Department of Energy.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, telework increases an employee's productivity and at
either no cost or a savings to the employee and employer, said
Posey, who was among the panelists Wednesday at a Metropolitan
Washington Council of Governments' discussion on the benefits of
telework.
</P>
<P>
   COG's Board of Directors, comprised of leaders from the District
of Columbia and surrounding jurisdictions, unanimously approved a
resolution Wednesday to have at least 600,000 employees, or 20
percent of the regional workforce, working at home at least one day
a month. That would mean 70,000 fewer vehicles on area roads each
day. Currently, approximately 12 percent of the workforce
telecommutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Automobile Association of America cites telecommuting as
among tools the region can use to decrease congestion, said Mantill
Williams, a AAA Mid-Atlantic region spokesman. Road expansions and
additional bridges also are necessary, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Through telecommuting, companies are better able to retain and
recruit employees, who tend to feel more appreciated and are more
productive, and the region benefits from improved air quality and
fewer traffic collisions, said Gerald E. Connolly, chairman of
COG's Board of Directors and a member of the Fairfax County, Va.,
board of supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Weidenfeld, a telework coordinator for Maryland,
telecommutes one day a week and estimates he saves approximately
$1,000 a year in automobile costs. The savings more than paid for
the technology he needed to establish a home office, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Loretta Kelley, a data analyzer with The Marasco Newton Group in
Arlington, Va., said telecommuting has reduced stress in her life,
particularly when she has to work late. Kelley said she is able to
relax and have dinner with her husband before finishing her work at
home.

<HEADLINE> Woman sorry for her role in double murder  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- The state's star witness against two
brothers accused in the killings of an 8-year-old boy and his
mother said she lied about what she told police.
</P>
<P>
   Josephine Lee told police she acted as a lookout and then
watched as Adrian Peeler gunned down Leroy ''B.J.'' Brown Jr. and
his mother, Karen Clarke, in their Bridgeport home on Jan. 7, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who agreed to testify against Adrian and his brother,
Russell, is now in the federal witness protection program. She
pleaded guilty in May to conspiracy to commit murder. In exchange
for her testimony, prosecutors had said they would ask for a
sentence of no more than seven years.
</P>
<P>
   But in a rambling letter she wrote to her lawyer in December--
after she struck a deal with prosecutors-- Lee talks about wanting
to do less time in prison.
</P>
<P>
   She says she has been lying about the case, but she doesn't get
specific.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything that I have told them is lies,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to make this thing right and deep down inside (God
knows) that I did not have anything to do with the murder.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, she writes, ''I can't not live with myself telling
a lie on the Peelers.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell Peeler's lawyer, John Walkley, said he interprets the
letter as a complete reversal by Lee and will ask that the charges
against his client be dismissed based on the letter.
</P>
<P>
   ''She said she wasn't involved and the Peelers were not
involved,'' Walkley said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It confirms what I've known all along, that she was never
there and that she had been lying about it from Day One,'' Walkley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's attorney, Richard Reeve, refused to comment on the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Jonathan Benedict could not be reached for comment. A
message was left at his home late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was released Wednesday in Bridgeport Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 33, lived across the street from B.J. and his mother.
</P>
<P>
   In her earlier statement to police, Lee said that after agreeing
to help the brothers, she paged Russell Peeler the day of the
murders to let him know the mother and son had arrived home.
</P>
<P>
   She said Adrian Peeler arrived within five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said she walked to Clarke's house with Adrian. When she rang
the doorbell, Clarke opened the door slightly after Lee identified
herself.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said Adrian Peeler then pushed the door open, sending
groceries flying.
</P>
<P>
   As B.J. and his mother ran up the stairs, Adrian chased them,
Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard the shot and the little boy was reaching out for his
mother,'' Lee said. ''He was yelling, 'Mommy, Mommy, Mommy,
Mommy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lee said she heard a shot coming from the bedroom where Clarke
had run.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Peeler then came out of the bedroom, where B.J. was still
screaming for his mother. Then Adrian Peeler shot B.J. in the head,
Lee told police.
</P>
<P>
   In letters Lee wrote to three Bridgeport police officers written
at about the same time she wrote the letter to her lawyer, Lee says
she's found God and is looking for forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know what I did was wrong. I get down on my knees every
night and ask God to forgive me for what I have done to the boy and
his mother,'' Lee wrote in a letter to Detective Dwayne McBride.
</P>
<P>
   She also says she is grateful to be alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank God that my life is still here because the Peelers did
not kill me and that is a blessing from God,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Peelers are accused of killing B.J. and his mother to stop
the boy from testifying against Russell in the 1998 murder of
Clarke's boyfriend, Rudolph Snead Jr. The boy had witnessed an
earlier driveby shooting in which Russell attempted to kill Snead
and was expected to be the prosecution's star witness.
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection is now under way for Russell Peeler's trial,
which is expected to begin later this month. Adrian Peeler's trial
is expected to begin this summer.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, the brothers could face the death penalty.

<HEADLINE> Pacific Rower Has 8 Toes Amputated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Rescued French rower Jo Le Guen was
recovering well Wednesday after doctors amputated eight of his toes
damaged by gangrene during his aborted attempt to row across the
Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors removed all five toes from Le Guen's left foot and three
middle ones from his right foot, said medical sources at the navy
hospital in Punta Arenas, Chile's southernmost city.
</P>
<P>
   The toes were removed from the joints without breaking the
bones, the sources said. He will be able to walk, but will probably
need a prothesis, they said. The remaining toes will help Le Guen
stay balanced, they added.
</P>
<P>
   Le Guen, an experienced rower, was plucked from the sea last
Monday, 61 days and one-third of the distance into his 5,580-mile
solo voyage from Wellington, New Zealand, to Cape Horn, Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Le Guen, the 52-year-old father of five, wanted to draw
attention to the damage being done to the world's oceans by
pollution. He gave up his journey and abandoned his boat,
''Keepitblue,'' after doctors suspected he had developed gangrene
in both his feet.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail to reporters, Le Guen said Tuesday that loosing his
toes, is ''still not far from the minimum price.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was first rescued, three of Le Guen's toes had turned
black, apparently damaged by rubbing against the foot straps he
used while rowing.

<HEADLINE> 'Legal orphans' languish with understaffed state agencies, busycourts  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY PARELLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- They're ''legal orphans'' -- children who
have been legally freed from abusive families, but not yet adopted
by new ones.
</P>
<P>
   And more and more of them are stuck in the system.
</P>
<P>
   New laws have pushed state agencies and courts to move faster on
child abuse cases that traditionally left kids in foster care for
years.
</P>
<P>
   It's working -- in part. More abusive parents are losing their
rights to their children. But, while adoptions are increasing, they
are not keeping pace with the number of children legally available
for adoption.
</P>
<P>
   Understaffed state agencies and busy courts are creating a raft
of children in a legal limbo, failing to accomplish the goal of
giving abused kids stable homes, child advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   They also predict that the backlog of waiting children will get
even worse because Gov. Christie Whitman's proposed budget offers
no new funding for the state centers that oversee these adoptions.
</P>
<P>
   The state's five adoption centers are the most understaffed of
all the Division of Youth and Family Service's offices, state
figures show.
</P>
<P>
   And they're juggling more cases.
</P>
<P>
   From 1997 to 1999, there was a 73 percent increase in the number
of abused children who were being freed for adoption, going from
about 700 to 1,230, according to Andy Williams, DYFS spokesman.
During that same time, adoption placements increased only 21
percent, going from about 670 to 810, he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 percent of these children live in foster homes that
will eventually adopt them. The state must find homes for the
others.
</P>
<P>
   There are not enough workers to process the paperwork to
finalize adoptions and find adoptive homes, said Ceil Zalkind,
associate director of the Association for Children of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, the number of children being overseen by the
Adoption Resource Centers has increased 32 percent, from about
3,000 to nearly 4,000, according to Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Staffing has increased 17 percent, from 114 caseworkers in
January 1999 to 134 currently, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are being totally inundated with cases because of the
(federal) Adoption and Safe Family Act,'' said Charles Cohen, union
shop steward for the Northern region adoption center.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government enacted the law in 1997 to prevent abused
children from spending years in foster care.
</P>
<P>
   ''The agency did not prepare for the cases coming into the
adoption centers,'' he said. ''We are totally unable to provide
services for these children.''
</P>
<P>
   A governor-appointed panel on DYFS recommended that staffing
ratios be brought up to national standards. But, more than two
years after the panel's report was issued, those ratios have
actually gotten worse at the adoption centers, according to state
figures.
</P>
<P>
   Adoption caseworkers are juggling 35 to 40 cases, instead of the
recommended 12 to 20 cases, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no justification for it,'' said Zalkind, who also
chairs the DYFS-appointed Adoption Service Advisory Committee.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey enacted its law in March 1999 to comply with the
federal statute.
</P>
<P>
   Under both laws, the state must move to terminate the rights of
parents whose children have been in foster care for 15 of the
previous 22 months. Children who have been in foster care for 12
consecutive months must get a ''permanency'' hearing before a
judge.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, when the federal government enacted the law, about
8,950 New Jersey children were in foster homes, group homes or
state institutions, Williams said. The law requires all of those
children to be in a permanent placement by the beginning of July.
</P>
<P>
   That, along with the shorter deadlines for all other children,
is creating an overload of cases.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the problem may be with the court system.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know that it's the adoption resource centers that are
not moving the cases,'' said Williams. ''It still takes time to get
these cases through the court system.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack McCarthy, director of child court services, said the
judiciary has doubled the number of judges handling these cases,
but even with that, it's been difficult to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our sense is the resources we've added at some point will meet
the filings,'' he said. ''Right now, we're in the peak of this
backlog reduction.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, that the adoption centers are failing to move
cases quickly enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''The time a case spends in case preparation (at the adoption
centers) is too long,'' he said. ''It's taken four, five, sometimes
six months to get these complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   Janet Farrand, president of the New Jersey Foster Parents
Association, is trying to adopt two of her foster children. She had
to wait two months to get an adoption worker assigned to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Adoption caseworkers oversee the adoption process, which
includes creating a medical history, collecting school records and
writing a narrative about the child's history with DYFS.
Caseworkers also work with foster and adoptive parents and help
recruit adoptive homes.
</P>
<P>
   State officials knew that more children would be transferred to
the adoption centers, under the new laws, Williams said. They also
knew staff was insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're looking at what our current resources are and figuring
out what our options are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zalkind's adoption committee recently asked Department of Human
Services chief Michele Guhl to request more money for the budget
that begins July 1 to hire more adoption caseworkers. The committee
also urged Guhl to ask for one-shot funding to clear up the backlog
of children awaiting adoption.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is serious,'' Zalkind said. ''This is a one-time
opportunity to provide permanent homes for children.''

<HEADLINE> Elian Judge Indicted Over Donation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A state judge who granted custody of Elian Gonzalez
to a great-uncle in Miami has been charged with illegally accepting
a $200,000 campaign contribution.
</P>
<P>
   A two-count misdemeanor indictment issued Tuesday charged
Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Rosa Rodriguez with illegally accepting
the money and failing to report it on required financial disclosure
forms.
</P>
<P>
   Each count against her carries a possible punishment of one year
in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney John Thornton Jr. said Rodriguez is innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ''The law is clear that judicial candidates can borrow money in
excess of $500,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-month investigation examined a loan to her 1998
campaign when she was first elected to the bench. She didn't
mention the money on one disclosure report but said on another that
it came from her brother Hugo, an assistant federal public
defender.
</P>
<P>
   Hugo Rodriguez borrowed the money from Miami attorney K. Gabriel
Bach, loaned it to his sister, and she loaned it to her campaign,
the brother's attorney Howard Srenbick said Wednesday. Bach did not
immediately return a call for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The loan was made under a 1982 opinion from the state Division
of Elections that unlimited loans to candidates rather than
campaigns are permitted, Srebnick said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You will find that Judge Rodriguez has a lot of company in
judges and other officials who have borrowed money from family
members and friends for running a campaign,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa Rodriguez told state election officials that she
''inadvertently omitted'' the loan from a disclosure form. After
learning she was under investigation, she said in October that she
was repaying the $120,000 balance to Bach.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez entered the national spotlight in January when she
ordered Elian to stay in Miami until a custody hearing could be
held. It was later disclosed that she had paid $60,000 to Armando
Gutierrez, the spokesman for Elian's Miami relatives, as a campaign
consultant for her judicial campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Supreme Court has the power to decide whether to
take action against Rodriguez, a Puerto Rican native and Yale law
school graduate, which could include suspension or removal from the
bench.

<HEADLINE> Ex La. Gov.: Tape Misinterpreted  </HEADLINE>
By NATALIE GOTT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- A secretly taped conversation about
splitting the proceeds of a proposed tugboat deal is being
misinterpreted by prosecutors, former Gov. Edwin Edwards testified
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not the first time in my life I thought of something and
then realized on sober reflection that it's not the thing to do,''
Edwards, 72, said during his second day on the witness stand in his
federal racketeering trial.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, who faces up to 350 years in prison if convicted on all
counts, maintained a calm demeanor during intense cross examination
regarding his financial relationship with former Treasure Chest
Casino owner Robert Guidry.
</P>
<P>
   Guidry, early in the three-month trial, testified he paid
Edwards and two others as much as $1.5 million in extortion money
for help in getting a riverboat casino license.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards admitted discussing a plan to get money out of Guidry in
the Feb. 27, 1997, taped conversation. But he said it was money
Guidry owed him, his son Stephen and friend Andrew Martin for
legitimate legal, lobbying and consulting work.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, the younger Edwards and four other men are
co-defendants. Prosecutors say they were involved in a series of
extortion and bribery schemes involving the licensing of riverboat
casinos before and after Edwards' last term ended in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the taped conversation, Martin and the Edwardses also are
heard discussing a way to rent a tugboat to Guidry, then hike up
the rental fee. They also discuss charging Guidry for made-up work.
</P>
<P>
   Martin is heard on the tape saying ''we get 30-30-30.''
Assistant U.S. Attorney Jim Letten asked Edwards whether that was a
reference to the payments the men were receiving from Guidry.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards first said he had no idea what Martin was talking about.
Then, he said prosecutors overlooked the fact that Martin used the
word ''get,'' instead of ''getting.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin was referring to what the men would ''get'' from the
aborted boat deal, not on what prosecutors said the men already
were ''getting'' from Guidry, Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hate to have my whole life hang on a couple of words,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Time Warner Reports Net Loss  </HEADLINE>
By SETH SUTEL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Leading media conglomerate Time Warner Inc.
reported higher earnings in most of its business areas Wednesday
but still posted a net loss for the first quarter due mainly to a
write-down in the troubled music retailer Columbia House.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner reported a net loss of $101 million, or 8 cents per
share, for the three months ended March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the $220 million charge for Columbia House, a $46
million charge related to its pending acquisition by America Online
Inc. and gains of $28 million on sales of cable systems, the
company earned 5 cents per share, beating analysts' estimates of 2
cents per share, as reported by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   In the same quarter a year ago, Time Warner reported net profits
of $120 million, or 10 cents a share, which included a one-time
gain of $215 million from the early termination of a video
distribution agreement with MGM. Without the gain, Time Warner
broke even in the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues rose 7.5 percent to $6.55 billion from $6.09 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In a discussion with reporters about first quarter earnings,
Time Warner executives said their combination with America Online
was going smoothly and was expected to close by the fall.
</P>
<P>
   They recognized concerns among investors about the complexity
involved in integrating the two very different companies, but said
they remained confident about the strategy of merging the online
reach of AOL with Time Warner's vast array of traditional media
assets spanning movies, cable TV, music and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ''I acknowledge we're going to make a lot of mistakes here, but
no one else is on this playing field,'' Time Warner chairman and
CEO Gerald Levin said.
</P>
<P>
   The hefty write-down on Columbia House was the main dark spot on
an otherwise good quarter for Time Warner. The struggling direct
sales company, which is half-owned by Sony, is going through a
major restructuring as it loses business to the likes of
Amazon.com. In March the companies called off a planned merger
between Columbia House and CDNow, an Internet music retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner reported operating gains in all its business
segments except for music, which has been slumping for the past few
quarters. Time Warner is hoping to revive this part of its domain
by merging its music operations into a joint venture with EMI,
which was announced in January.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest gains in earnings came from Time Warner's cable
businesses, which include cable networks such as TBS, HBO and
Cinemax as well as delivery of cable subscription services.
</P>
<P>
   HBO has been having a good run with its hit series ''The
Sopranos,'' and TBS and TNT also had better results despite a
downturn in World Champion Wrestling, which faces tough competition
from the World Wrestling Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Operating results from cable systems rose 13 percent during the
quarter due to higher advertising revenues and subscription rates
as well as the continued rollout of digital cable and high-speed
Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   The 450,000 customers receiving next-generation digital cable
still represent a small part of Time Warner's total customer base
of 12.7 million. Time Warner is the country's second-largest cable
provider behind AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner's publishing arm, which includes Time Inc., the
nation's largest magazine publisher, also had higher results. The
company credited higher advertising revenues at titles such as
Fortune and InStyle.
</P>
<P>
   Like the music division, Time Warner's publishing operation also
had a laggard direct sales arm that was dragging down results, the
Book-of-the-Month Club. That unit is also going through a revamp to
meet the challenges of online retailers and discount chains, and is
being merged with Doubleday Direct, the book club owned by the
German media conglomerate Bertelsmann AG.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner's stock, which has been moving in tandem with the
shares of AOL, was off $5.75 at $90 on the New York Stock Exchange,
while AOL shares were down $3.81\ at $62.68\.

<HEADLINE> Ambassador Writes U.N. Catnap Guide  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations is known for its
marathon talkfests that can put even the most seasoned diplomats to
sleep. Now there's hope for an antidote.
</P>
<P>
   Former French Ambassador Alain Dejammet has done a service to
all his colleagues by writing a 14-page, tongue-in-cheek guide to
the best places at U.N. headquarters to escape the boredom and
catch a catnap.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sleeping at the United Nations,'' a pocket-sized guide in
French with a little kitty on the cover, was one of Dejammet's
parting gifts before leaving the post in March for a new
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, the dry-witted ambassador ranks 12 lounges,
consultation rooms and sitting areas around the U.N. complex on a
scale of 1-20 for their comfort, light, calmness and frequency of
use.
</P>
<P>
   Dejammet then gives an overall ranking, ranging from
''ill-advised,'' (known by its symbol of !!!) to ''exceptional''
(which gets a ranking).
</P>
<P>
   ''Impression of being in an abandoned monastery, in spite of the
snores,'' Dejammet wrote of the periodical room at the U.N.
library, which got three stars: very agreeable.
</P>
<P>
   The conference room of the European Union liaison office got
high marks for comfort: ''Abundance of coffee and delicious little
cakes.''
</P>
<P>
   But it lost points for calmness. ''Even without meetings, a nap
can be interrupted at any moment by the sudden arrival of an
Eurocrat demanding details of the French position concerning the
promotion of rights of young girls in crises affecting landlocked
countries,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Meditation Room, which sits across the street from U.N.
headquarters, got the worst score. Its blue Chagall windows evoke a
''draculesque crypt,'' while the squeaking sneakers of tourists
allow for little meditation, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Only the French office at the United Nations, which is used for
private consultations, earned four stars and the unflinching praise
of Dejammet who evoked a Matisse masterpiece in saying it was where
everything was ''luxe, calme et volupte.''
</P>
<P>
   ''One speaks of old ministers who never reappeared after a
conference in the 'little bureau','' he said nostalgically.
</P>
<P>
   It got marks of 20 all around, ''but the price to pay was the
risk incurred of being a member of the French delegation,'' added
Dejammet, who himself wasn't known to have dozed off during long
debates or conferences.
</P>
<P>
   The book could be a best seller among U.N. diplomats -- but
Dejammet hasn't disclosed whether he plans to publish it. He first
shared it with the French newspaper Le Monde.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy U.S. Ambassador Nancy Soderberg said Wednesday copies had
already been circulated and discussed among council members and
that she considered it a ''whimsical legacy'' that Dejammet had
left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time I go into a corner of the U.N. I will think of
Alain Dejammet with renewed delight'' she told reporters. Dejammet
was one of the hardest working diplomats at the United Nations
''and no one begrudges him a moment's rest in a quiet corner where
you all can't find him,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Jones Earnings Double in 1Q  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Dow Jones &AMP; Co. reported Wednesday that its
income nearly doubled in the first quarter of the year, driven by
big gains in advertising revenues from The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting a profit from the sale of a financial publishing
unit, Dow Jones earned $79.2 million during the three months ended
March 31, or 88 cents per share, beating analyst forecasts of 80
cents per share, as reported by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Including the gain from selling Dow Jones Financial Publishing
Corp., the company had net earnings of $88.7 million, or 98 cents
per share.
</P>
<P>
   In the same period a year ago, the company earned $40.9 million
or 44 cents per share before a special gain, and net earnings of
$51.5 million or 56 cents per share including the gain.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the New York-based Dow Jones rose 25 cents to $72.12{
in trading at 4:30 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Jones' revenues jumped 25 percent during the quarter to $579
million from $462 million in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues from publishing, which makes up the majority of the
company's business, rose 35 percent compared to a year ago thanks
to significant gains in advertising in The Journal, where ad
lineage grew 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas editions of the paper also did well. Dow Jones also
reported a 23 percent gain in ad lineage in its European edition
and 27 percent gains in its Asian edition.
</P>
<P>
   The company also reported a 10 percent increase in revenues from
electronic publishing, which include Dow Jones Newswires, Dow
Jones' interest in its news database with Reuters PLC called
Factiva, as well as online operations such as WSJ.com. The number
of subscribers to WSJ.com grew to 438,000 as of March 31, up 55
percent from the same time a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the growth in revenues from electronic publishing,
income from the division fell 37 percent to $8.5 million as the
company continued to make new investments in building up those
businesses. Dow Jones has said it is considering issuing a separate
class of stock to track some or all of its Internet assets.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue from the company's Ottawa community newspaper group rose
9 percent to $81 million amid a 7 percent gain in advertising
lineage.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Dow Jones broke out results for its joint
ventures with Hearst Corp. in SmartMoney magazine, SmartMoney.com,
and a newly launched parenting magazine called Offspring.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Jones' stake produced revenues of $7.2 million, up 31
percent from the same time a year ago, while its share of the
operating loss was $3.6 million, due to larger investments to build
up SmartMoney.com, compared to operating profits of $500,000 a year
ago.

<HEADLINE> S.C. Debates Confederate Flag  </HEADLINE>
By LEIGH STROPE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Lawmakers on Wednesday began debating a
compromise plan to remove the Confederate flag from the Statehouse
dome, as hundreds of flag supporters lined up to watch.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate flag bill is the first such legislation to the reach
the floor of either chamber this session. Key senators had worked
out an agreement they thought would satisfy flag supporters and
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal began unraveling with flag supporters' objections
to an clarifying amendment offered by flag opponents. Both sides
worked to save the compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ladies and gentlemen, we are very, very close to making
history,'' said Democratic Sen. Verne Smith. He said flag opponents
wanted to make sure tricks weren't being played on them.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would remove the banner from the dome and place a
similar battle flag behind an existing monument honoring
Confederate soldiers on Statehouse grounds. The flag would fly on
the north side of the Statehouse from a pole no taller than the
monument.
</P>
<P>
   That element was added to satisfy black lawmakers and other flag
opponents who did not want the flag in a prominent place where it
could be seen by passers-by.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the flag say it is a racist symbol, while
supporters say it represents Southern heritage and honors
Confederate war dead.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Legislature can take down the flag, which has flown
since 1962. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People has urged tourists to boycott South Carolina until the flag
is removed.
</P>
<P>
   As the Legislature debated the flag, tennis player Serena
Williams, who is black, withdrew from the Family Circle Cup, the
biggest sports name to back the NAACP boycott.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would remove the Confederate flags hanging in the
House and Senate chambers, and would protect all monuments,
memorials and buildings erected in honor of the Confederacy or the
civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   Not all senators were on board.
</P>
<P>
   ''Race relations will not be the same in this state in my
lifetime if you take that flag down,'' said Republican Sen. Harvey
Peeler. He said ''the rebels would yell'' if the flag was removed
because they do not want to be told what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of supporters with Confederate flags decorating hats,
shirts, belts and jewelry lined up to get inside the Senate gallery
to watch the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need a nonpartisan, binding referendum,'' Steven Roark
said. ''The people who lost their lives for that flag didn't know
anything about politics. They just knew they had to pick up the
squirrel gun and fight for the farm.''

<HEADLINE> Tax Deadline Is April 17 This Year  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   This year's tax filing deadline for most of America
is Monday,
April 17, instead of the usual April 15. That's because April 15
falls on a Saturday this year, not a normal business day.
<TEXT>
<P>
   People in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire,
Rhode Island, Vermont and most of New York outside of the New York
City area have yet another day, April 18, because of the annual
Patriot's Day holiday on April 17. These returns have to go to the
IRS service centers in either Andover, Mass., -- where Patriot's Day
is a legal holiday -- or Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS decided it would be easiest to simply allow all those
northeast filers another day.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, April 18 doesn't apply to New York City and Nassau,
Rockland, Suffolk and Westchester counties.

<HEADLINE> Louisiana Clings to French Roots  </HEADLINE>
By BRETT MARTEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- So what if French hasn't been the lingua
franca in Louisiana for almost 200 years?
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana -- itself named for France's King Louis XIV -- still is
loaded with reminders of France, from the city of Lafayette to the
capital, Baton Rouge, to Elysian Fields Avenue in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The tricolor still flies prominently above a statue of Joan of
Arc at Place de France near the French Quarter's French Market. New
Orleans even named a street after former French President Charles
de Gaulle.
</P>
<P>
   These are all reassuring symbols to the French, unabashed
exporters of their culture. And such reassurances seem to be what
keeps an official French presence here despite Louisiana's
diminished political and economic significance in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Established in 1804, the French Consulate in New Orleans has
seen a precipitous decline in its traditional responsibilities
since the mid-1980s, when growth in Southern cities such as Atlanta
and Miami began to take off.
</P>
<P>
   Pulling out now, many think, would produce a stinging response:
Non!
</P>
<P>
   ''I think a lot of French citizens would manifest their
displeasure with closing the consulate,'' said Bernard Maizeret,
the French consul general for Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Serious discussions about closing the consulate began after the
fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, when a number of Western nations
refocused diplomatic resources in Eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union, said Maizeret.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, an official French presence here has survived in
large part on national pride, while a number of other countries,
including Belgium, Germany, Italy and Holland, have withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana was claimed by the French explorer Sieur de La Salle
for King Louis XIV in 1682, and controlled by France for the better
part of the next 121 years, until the Louisiana Purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Maizeret estimates that nearly 300,000 Louisianans -- mostly in
the Lafayette area -- still speak French to some extent, and France
wants them to have every reason to continue to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the French care more about our French than Louisianans
do and I think it's important they keep their role,'' said Kermit
Bouillion, 48, of Lafayette, who owns a cafe in nearby Erath where
French Cajun bands play to packed houses. ''With the consul in our
state and the presence he has, I think people here are more proud
of their French background and speaking the language.''
</P>
<P>
   Bouillion and others who care about Louisiana's historical links
to France are pleased by ongoing renovations at the consul's Garden
District mansion, where signs of neglect had lent credence to fears
the office would close.
</P>
<P>
   The office was once the only official French presence in the
South, covering Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kansas,
Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, a French consulate opened in Miami, followed by one in
Atlanta in 1989. That, combined with an expansion of the Houston
office in 1991, reduced the New Orleans consulate's territory to
only Louisiana -- and the Houston office even took responsibility
for economic matters here.
</P>
<P>
   Such developments left the New Orleans office with the rather
unconventional raison d'etre -- as far as consulates go -- of
promoting French culture to a relatively small region.
</P>
<P>
   However, France boosted Maizeret's staff, adding a vice consul
to free up the consul general for public appearances, and a
language specialist to help coordinate Louisiana's French teaching
and immersion programs.
</P>
<P>
   The consulate works closely with the state Council for the
Development of French in Louisiana to recruit French teachers,
promote French-language publications and broadcasts, and organize
cultural exchanges. Several French or bilingual newspapers are
published in the state and French TV programs are shown
periodically in several areas.
</P>
<P>
   ''The French are so proud of who they are -- their culture and
language,'' said council spokesman Alan Brown. ''When they find a
willing audience like Louisiana, they're certainly not going to let
that slip away.''

<HEADLINE> Labor Opposes U.S.-China Trade  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HUGHES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As thousands of labor activists rallied
Wednesday against a U.S.-China trade bill, Commerce Secretary
William Daley released a report showing the measure would benefit
every state.
</P>
<P>
   The union members protested outside the Capitol while their
leaders pressed lawmakers to vote against a bill that would give
permanent normal trade status to China. They claim the measure
would cost U.S. jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Teamsters President James P. Hoffa told some 5,000 cheering
members that corporations supporting the legislation have lost
their moral compass. He said China should be forced to improve its
human rights record before being granted the trade status.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to put China on probation'' before granting them
trade favors, Hoffa said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Daley released a study for every state
showing how each would benefit from enhanced trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Commerce Department said Washington state would
see major tariff reductions for aircraft, paper and wood products;
Pennsylvania would gain from the removal of import restrictions for
construction and medical equipment; and Louisiana -- where half the
current exports to China are agricultural products -- no longer
would have to compete against export subsidies for China's
agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce officials planned to distribute the reports to
lawmakers before they head home for next week's spring recess.
</P>
<P>
   The trade bill would end annual congressional review of China's
trade status and ease China's entry into the Geneva-based World
Trade Organization. It is supported by President Clinton but
opposed by a mix of labor, environmental groups and some human
rights organizations.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a partisan issue, as illustrated by the speakers at
the rally, who ranged from socialist Rep. Bernard Sanders of
Vermont to conservative Reform Party presidential hopeful Pat
Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad Washington, a 23-year-old General Motors Corp. worker
from Warren, Mich., who missed four days of work to come to the
protest, said those who support the trade bill will have to answer
to voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Senate and the House of Representatives, we just want them
to listen to us,'' he said. ''We can vote them out of office. We
can make a point just as well as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   Daley said labor groups and environmentalists have a ''knee
jerk'' reaction against trade, blaming it for a variety of ills
when in fact technology improvements have more to do with job
losses than trade.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is scheduled for a House vote the week of May 22. No
vote has been scheduled in the Senate, where it has wide bipartisan
support. A majority of House Democrats are believed to oppose the
legislation.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Slide for a Second Day  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Government bonds tumbled Wednesday for a second
straight day as traders continued to snap up bonds of corporations
and agencies such as Fannie Mae, which offer higher returns.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond dipped } point,
or $7.50 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the
opposite direction, rose to 5.81 percent from 5.76 percent late
Tuesday. On Monday, the yield had fallen to an 11-month low of 5.66
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Traders were looking for safe harbors for their money as
technology and blue-chip stocks plunged Wednesday. But with returns
relatively low on government bonds, investors looked to high-grade
corporate bonds and other relatively safe securities, such as the
mortgage-backed bonds of quasigovernment agencies Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac.
</P>
<P>
   In the broader bond market, short-term notes fell 1/16 point to
3/32 point, while intermediate notes fell \ point to { point,
reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information service.
</P>
<P>
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.81 percent as the
discount fell 0.01 percentage point from Tuesday to 5.66 percent.
Six-month yields were 6.05 percent, as the discount fell 0.05
percentage point to 5.80 percent. One-year yields were 6.11 percent
as the discount fell 0.01 percentage point to 5.80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the
discount is the interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, rose to 5.94 percent from 5.75 percent Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell 5/32 at 95 29/32. The average yield to
maturity was 5.92 percent, up from 5.91 percent.

<HEADLINE> Expectation Shadows Gen. Powell,  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Five years after he ruled out running for
president and three years since be began talking almost full-time
about children, retired Gen. Colin Powell still gets The Questions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Um, thank you,'' he began Wednesday when the topic inevitably
arose about his political future, or non-future, or his interest in
a Cabinet job, or not.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have never had any political inclination,'' he told the
American Society of Newspaper Editors at its annual convention,
stressing ''never.'' ''Political life is not for me.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said later he would consider any nonpolitical role
offered to him by a president or president-elect, keeping alive the
possibility he'd end up in the Cabinet if Republican George W. Bush
wins the presidential election in November.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Powell, a registered Republican, ruled out being
Bush's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   The former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff does not deny
his popularity. Indeed, he recognizes it as a commodity and puts it
to use as head of America's Promise, an organization for children
formed in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But he said his consistently high rankings in public esteem, as
measured by polls, have never been tested in the political arena
and therefore don't mean anything politically. ''That number you
always see is a popularity number,'' he said. ''It's not a
political number.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell said he hasn't had a moment's regret since deciding
against running for president after giving the idea much thought in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to bring a certain passion and commitment to it, and
you have to have a certain need for it,'' he said. He said he
realized he did not possess those qualities for politics.
</P>
<P>
   But he hasn't been shy about weighing in on some political
issues. Powell recently urged members of Congress not to amend the
Constitution to ban flag burning and he spoke forcefully Wednesday
in favor of granting China normal trade status on a permanent
basis.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Protect Giant Sequoias  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ancient groves of giant sequoia redwoods will
come under permanent federal protection under an order to be signed
by President Clinton, setting aside 355,000 acres of California
forests.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is to announce his decision Saturday in a visit to
Sequoia National Forest in central California, White House
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have campaigned for years for greater
protection for the sequoias, some of which are 3,000 years old and
measure 100 feet around the base. But critics complain that
Clinton's announcement is politically motivated, threatens
recreation and will cost precious timber jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is nothing more than political posturing,'' said Rep.
George Radanovich, R-Calif., whose district includes part of the
proposed monument. ''I think it's more for a legacy and
presidential politics than for the health of the sequoias.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists warmly welcomed Clinton's expected
announcement but said the key would be the extent of restrictions
imposed on the Forest Service for cutting trees and building roads.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really are going to have to wait a little bit to see how
much latitude he leaves the Forest Service,'' said Nathaniel
Lawrence, senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council. ''The president is going to have to help them by tying
their hands so they don't go off and do what they reflexively do.''
</P>
<P>
   The trees will be designated a protected monument under the 1906
Antiquities Act, which allows presidents -- without congressional
approval -- to safeguard objects of historic and scientific
interest. It is the same law that President Theodore Roosevelt used
to set aside the Grand Canyon in 1908 and President Carter invoked
to establish large sections of Alaska wilderness in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has angered some western lawmakers and local officials
by invoking the Antiquities Act on previous occasions to set aside
millions of acres of land for special protection.
</P>
<P>
   Radanovich said the sequoia decision ''exemplifies the reason
why we should alter the Antiquities Act.'' The congressman is one
of three lawmakers sponsoring a bill to block the monument with an
18-month federal study of how to protect the trees.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of California's remaining giant sequoias are part
of Sequoia National Forest, outside the protective boundaries of
nearby Kings Canyon, Sequoia and Yosemite national parks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ancestors of the giant sequoias once grew as far east as
Colorado and Wyoming; now these precious trees are only found on
the west slope of the Sierra Nevadas,'' Agriculture Secretary Dan
Glickman said in a letter to Clinton recommending creation of
Sequoia National Monument. ''To insure the permanent survival of
these ancient giants we must provide them with permanent
protection.''
</P>
<P>
   A bill last year to alter the Antiquities Act was approved by
the House but died in the Senate. It would have limited a
presidential order for monuments to 5,000 acres, rather than the
current designations without any limits on size.
</P>
<P>
   ''By our bill, we were trying to get the president to focus on
the science of the issue,'' Radanovich said. ''This helps Clinton
secure environmental support for Gore -- the support of the radical
environmental groups that advise this administration.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials have acknowledged that Clinton's use of
the Antiquities Act is part of an attempt to leave an environmental
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   The sequoia announcement will be made during a trip that begins
Friday with an education speech and political fund-raisers in
Atlanta and then moves west to California. After visiting Sequoia
National Forest, Clinton will continue to Los Angeles for a
fund-raiser Saturday night with Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   After a day off Sunday, Clinton will begin a two-day tour to
encourage investment in areas of the country that are not
benefitting from the economic good times. He will start his trip
Monday in East Palo Alto, Calif., which has been left behind from
Silicon Valley's prosperity. Later that day, the president will
visit a Navajo Indian reservation at Shiprock, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   He will conclude his trip Tuesday with an appearance in Chicago
at a high-technology show, COMDEX, where he will encourage efforts
to narrow the ''digital divide'' between computer haves and
have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will return to Washington on Tuesday and set out again
Wednesday, this time to help dedicate a memorial in Oklahoma City
in honor of the 168 people killed in the Oklahoma City bombing five
years ago.

<HEADLINE> Bush To Meet With Gay Republicans  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Religious conservatives are looking for signs
that George W. Bush won't change his position on gay issues after
meeting Thursday with activists in an effort to inch back to the
political center.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not the meeting that's the problem. It's what he says,''
said Janet Parcell, spokeswoman for the Family Research Council.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative group wants the presumptive GOP presidential
nominee to ''declare that he opposes special federal designation
for homosexuals and defend marriage as a union between one man and
one woman,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a move to soothe jitters among the GOP's conservative base,
the Bush campaign has been telling key religious activists that the
Texas governor would host the meeting, but not change his
conservative views.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Bush campaign ... assured me that his positions would
remain intact,'' said Michael Farris of the Home Schooling Legal
Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign billed the meeting at Bush campaign headquarters in
Austin as a discussion of common conservative ground -- reforming
education, health care and tax systems. Not likely to be resolved
are prickly issues on the activists' agenda such as gay marriage,
which Bush opposes.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are some disagreements on certain issues,'' Bush
spokesman Scott McClellan said. ''But this meeting is another
example of Gov. Bush's inclusive record as a different kind of
Republican, one who reaches out to people from all walks of life
and unites them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay activists say the meeting itself is a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''It shows how Governor Bush is working like no other candidate
before to further unite the Republican Party,'' said Carl Schmid of
the Human Rights Campaign, a gay political organization, who
planned to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore's campaign warned that gay activists
would be better served to hold Bush to action, rather than words.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Kathleen Begala noted Bush's opposition to hate
crimes legislation after a black Texas man was tied to a pickup
truck and dragged to his death in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what gay Republicans would really like him to do is
something like back a hate crimes bill in Texas,'' Begala said.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the meeting may be less about gay issues than
moderating his political image after his appeals to religious
conservatives helped him win the South Carolina presidential
primary in February.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with gay Republicans has been a messy matter for Bush
and, historically, for the GOP. Rep. Brian Bilbray, R-Calif., is
pleased to see the governor finally making the gesture.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some Republicans believe they can't relate to the gay
community without pandering and without amending their perceptions
of political right and wrong,'' Bilbray said. ''The gay community
gets overtaxed and overregulated like everyone else. They are a
constituency who should be consulted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Log Cabin Republicans, an organization of gays, has
pressured Bush to take a stand on gay issues. Bush has shunned
leaders of the group.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Francis, a gay public relations executive in Washington
whose brother, James Francis Jr., is a prominent Bush fund-raiser,
made it happen, according to those close to the event. Included in
the invitation list are elected officials such as former Rep. Steve
Gunderson of Wisconsin, Plattsburgh, N.Y. Mayor Dan Stewart and
David Catania of Washington's city council.
</P>
<P>
   GOP moderates who supported Bush's vanquished rival John McCain
said the meeting could be a step toward reconciling conservative
and moderate Republicans, as well as a gesture that may resonate
with the Democrats and independents who supported the Arizona
senator.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Molinari, the Staten Island (N.Y.) borough president who
backed McCain, said Bush ''has to demonstrate to the electorate at
large that he's reaching out.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What we saw through the primary was him moving more to the
right and the hard core Republican base. That's not enough to
win,'' Molinari said.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Off 286.27; Dow Off 161.95  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index continued its steep
slide Wednesday, plummeting 286 points and closing below 4,000
after a Goldman Sachs analyst lowered his expectations for
Microsoft's revenues during the just-ended quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's woes sent a chill through the entire technology
sector and demolished an early rally by the Dow Jones industrial
average.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq finished a volatile session 286.27 points lower at
3,769.63, its second worst point drop in history and its first
close below 4,000 since Jan. 31. The 7.1 percent decline was the
sixth worst in percentage terms.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq is now down 7.4 percent for the year to date, having
given back all of the 24 percent gain it had achieved as of March
10, when it closed at an all-time high of 5,048.62. The closing
level was the Nasdaq's lowest since Jan. 6, when it closed at
3,727.13.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow fell 161.95 to 11,125.13. The blue-chip index spent most
of the day in positive territory as financial stocks soared, but
was pulled lower by the drop in technology shares.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also fell. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
dropped 33.42 to 1,467.17 and the Russell 2000 index of smaller
companies fell 16.69 to 493.44.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which has already seen its market value plunge as it
fights antitrust charges, fell 4{ to 79]. Wednesday morning,
Goldman Sachs analyst Rick Sherlund cut his revenue estimate for
the company's fiscal third quarter to $5.75 billion from $5.95
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sherlund said in a research note that personal computer sales
during the quarter appear to have missed Goldman Sachs's earlier
estimates.
</P>

   ''This is a further negative for sentiment in a poor tech
market,'' Sherlund said. Computer makers slumped on the news; Dell
fell 4 1/16 to 51], IBM fell 6] to 113 and Hewlett-Packard plunged
10 13/16 to 135.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's drop provided the latest catalyst for the continuing
drop in the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   ''If investors think there's a prick in the bubble, that gives
them a reason to get out of some stocks that are making them
nervous anyway,'' said Robert M. Balentine, chief executive officer
of investment advisory firm Balentine &AMP; Co. in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The index has tumbled 25 percent since its March 10 high, and is
now down more than 4 percent in the year to date.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's decline accelerated last week, when the index fell
more than 400 points over the course of two wildly volatile
sessions. Last week, with many unproven, more speculative
technology stocks spiraling lower, some investment brokerages
demanded that investors put up cash to cover stocks that were
bought on margin -- with money borrowed from the brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   Those ''margin calls'' may have come into play Wednesday,
exacerbating the selloff. Traders said Dow stocks faltered as
investors scrambled to raise cash in case the Nasdaq's steep drop
spurs a new round of margin calls in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts remain divided on whether the Nasdaq is headed back
toward last week's low point of about 3,650 or poised for a round
of bargain-hunting. Balentine, for one, believes that the
technology selloff has not yet run its course.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will hurt the day trader, and the person who lost all
their diversification in favor of an all-technology portfolio,'' he
said. ''But these stocks had so far to fall that you've still got
to believe that this is healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, analysts say, the volatility has brought some
welcome skepticism to the technology market, ending the frenzy for
any stock tied to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''Investors will be more discriminating in their buying of
technology and Internet stocks,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, chief
market strategist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings reports continued to provide some enticement to buy
individual stocks. Enron rose 2 to 71[ after reporting
first-quarter earnings of 40 cents a share. Analysts had
anticipated earnings of 37 cents a share. The strong report
confirmed expectations that energy companies will show the sharpest
profit growth for the recently ended quarter.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan rose 1 15/16 to 136 11/16. The investment bank
earned $3.37 per share in the first quarter, above analysts'
estimates of $2.81 a share.
</P>
<P>
   American Express rose 5 9/16 to 150} amid expectations that it,
too, will report strong earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Clorox rose 2} to 40 1/16 after the company secured an
arrangement with online grocer Webvan to sell its products over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange. On the Nasdaq, decliners led advancers
by a 10-to-3 margin.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE composite volume totaled 1.42 billion shares, compared with
1.19 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.5 percent.
Germany's DAX index rose 0.01 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 0.5

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Compensate Nuclear Workers  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Proclaiming it wants to correct decades of
injustice, the Clinton administration on Wednesday unveiled a
proposal to compensate thousands of nuclear defense workers who
became ill because of exposure to radiation and toxic chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   The compensation plan, which is expected to cost at least $520
million over the first five years, would apply to about 3,000
workers at former nuclear bomb making sites in 10 states, the
Energy Department said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are moving forward to do the right thing by these
workers,'' said Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, calling on
Congress to approve the compensation package this year.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said these workers ''labored under difficult and
dangerous conditions'' for much of Cold War, producing nuclear
material and bombs. Not only were many of them exposed to cancer
and other illnesses from radiation and toxic chemicals, but then
the government for decades refused to acknowledge their claims, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Justice has finally come, the government is for a change on
their side and not against them,'' said Richardson at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of congressional action was unclear, although given
a better chance since a wide range of workers from all parts of the
country have been included.
</P>
<P>
   Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers from states where the
weapons plants are located promised to press for quick action.
''This government for decades turned its back on (these workers')
needs,'' said Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., who has fought for
compensation for defense workers with beryllium disease.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the workers have claimed for years that their illnesses
-- leukemia, lung cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma and various other
cancers as well as beryllium disease, asbestosis, and other
ailments -- were the result of being exposed to radiation and
chemicals during years of work at the bomb factories in the 1950s
through the 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the government has fought lawsuits demanding
compensation, and argued that there is no proof the illnesses were
caused by their work. But last January, a presidentially appointed
panel concluded that there was ''credible evidence'' that the
illnesses were related to work exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to try to correct this injustice,'' said
Richardson, although acknowledging that many of the workers
''understandably may (still) be suspicious'' that this is another
''empty promise.''
</P>
<P>
   At Richardson's side was Vickie Hatfield of Kingston, Tenn.,
whose 79-year-old father is severely ill with chronic beryllium
disease and asbestosis, as a result of years of work at an Oak
Ridge, Tenn., nuclear weapons assembly plant.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't give him back what he's lost,'' said Hatfield,
describing her father's difficulties in breathing and everyday
activities. But she said the proposed compensation would help
defray enormous medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department plan would make a lump-sum payments of at
least $100,000 to workers or their survivors, or allow them to
negotiate a package that would cover medical costs, lost wages and
job retraining.
</P>
<P>
   The department estimated that about 1,500 workers with cancer,
750 workers who suffer from beryllium disease or associated
illness, and 750 workers with other illnesses will be eligible.
During the Cold War years about 600,000 people worked at the
bomb-making and nuclear material plants across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The department estimated the cost of the program will be $120
million annually for the first three years, declining to $80
million a year as the backlog of claims is reduced.
</P>
<P>
   The compensation package applies to people at The Hanford
Reservation in Washington, Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee,
Savannah River Site in South Carolina, the Nevada Test Site, the
Rocky Flats Complex in Colorado, the Pantex Plant in Texas, the
Mound Plant and Fernald Environmental Management Project in Ohio,
the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, the Los
Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, and gaseous diffusion
plants at Piketon, Ohio, Paducah, Ky., and Oak Ridge, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Workers exposed to beryllium need only demonstrate they have
chronic beryllium disease or beryllium sensitivity to be eligible
for compensation. Other workers with certain cancers as a result of
exposure to radiation will have to meet dose-exposure levels.
</P>
<P>
   But David Michaels, the DOE's assistant secretary for health and
safety, said when information about exposure dosage is not
available -- as often will be the case because of poor record
keeping -- the government will assume exposure at the highest amount
for whatever task was performed.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at the three gaseous diffusion plants will be eligible
for compensation if they have primary lung or bone cancer or
another specific cancer specified by Congress.

<HEADLINE> Senate Battles Over Marriage Tax  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Republican senators accused Democrats of
trying to delay a bill cutting income taxes for married couples,
the House refused again Wednesday to back a constitutional
amendment requiring a two-thirds vote of Congress to raise most
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The hangup on the GOP's 10-year, $248 billion marriage tax cut
was a list of 10 amendments Democrats wanted to offer, including
measures as diverse as a Medicare prescription drug benefit and a
new tax credit for college tuition.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an attempt to throttle this legislation here in the
Senate,'' said Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans wanted only those amendments they considered
''relevant'' to the marriage tax bill, but Minority Leader Tom
Daschle said the Democratic amendments and the bill itself both
dealt with how to spend projected budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are other ways to spend that money,'' said Daschle,
D-S.D. ''In our view, all of these issues are relevant to the
debate on the marriage penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless an agreement is reached, the Senate is set to vote
Thursday on a Republican motion to end delaying tactics and begin
consideration of the bill. But unless five Democrats joined them,
GOP sponsors doubted they could get the necessary 60 votes to end
the filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would gradually reduce income taxes for almost all
married couples, including the 25 million who now pay higher
''marriage penalty'' taxes than they would if single.
</P>
<P>
   ''For 10 years, we have talked about the unfairness of the
marriage penalty tax,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss. ''We're going to see who is for eliminating it and who is
not.''
</P>
<P>
   The House earlier this year passed a smaller marriage tax cut
totaling $182 billion over 10 years. President Clinton, who also
proposed a more modest marriage penalty relief bill, has threatened
to veto both GOP bills, saying they would consume too much of the
projected budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   As they do each year, Republican congressional leaders are using
the final week of the annual income tax filing season to underscore
their political priorities for tax cuts and tax reform. A part of
that ritual was acted out again Wednesday when the House again
failed to approve a constitutional amendment requiring a two-thirds
vote of Congress to raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment, which required a two-thirds vote itself to pass,
fell 50 votes short, a modest improvement over last year's 57-vote
margin. Opponents, including 14 Republicans, had trouble taking the
issue seriously, and it went down on a 234-192 vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one thinks this is going anywhere,'' said Rep. Barney
Frank, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters said they wouldn't give up, arguing that drawing
distinctions for voters between Republicans and Democrats on taxes
was a key reason the measure kept returning each year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is important for people to understand that it is too easy
for Congress to raise taxes,'' said Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas.
''It may take us 20 more years, it may take us five more years, but
it is the right thing to do.''

<HEADLINE> House Upholds Low-Flow Toilets  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An effort to repeal the federal law requiring
low-flow toilets could be going down the drain.
</P>
<P>
   A House panel rejected a bill Wednesday that would have
eliminated 1992 federal water conservation regulations for toilets,
urinals, shower heads and faucets.
</P>
<P>
   Current standards require toilets to use 1.6 gallons of water
per flush instead of the 3.5 gallons that was the previous norm.
Supporters say the rules save some 600 million gallons of water a
day and avoid a 50-state patchwork of commode regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would suggest that there is one thing more asinine than
federal regulation of plumbing supplies, and that's 50 different
state standards,'' said Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass. ''Such an
outcome could have a severe constipating effect on interstate
commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the federal standards contend low-powered potties
often take two or three flushes to clear all the waste, eliminating
their conservation benefits. They say consumers should get a
choice.
</P>
<P>
   ''The American people are being forced to use toilets and
showers that simply don't work,'' said Rep. Charles Norwood, R-Ga.
''Privacy and freedom are the only things that are being flushed
away.''
</P>
<P>
   A House Commerce subcommittee voted 13-12 Wednesday to keep the
low-flow toilet regulations. Joining 11 Democrats were two
Republican lawmakers from fast-growing states with limited fresh
water: Reps. Heather Wilson of New Mexico and Michael Bilirakis of
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, the subcommittee's chairman and a
co-sponsor of the bill, said he and other lawmakers have gotten
complaints from numerous people upset with their low-flow toilets --
and angry that the government invades their bathrooms. Plumbers
told the panel last year that a black market has sprung up for
high-capacity toilets smuggled from Canada or Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's sponsor, Joe Knollenberg, R-Mich., plans to try to
resurrect it later this year, spokesman John Akouri said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I agree with Mr. Knollenberg when he said, 'Get the federal
government out of the bathroom.' We never should have been there in
the first place,'' Barton said.
</P>
<P>
   Plumbing manufacturers acknowledge complaints about earlier
versions of low-flow toilets but say newer models flush better.
Most municipalities support the current regulations, saying
powerful new bathroom fixtures could overload aging water systems.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should be conserving more water, not less,'' said Rep.
Frank Pallone Jr., D-N.J., whose district includes the headquarters
of toilet-maker American Standard.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia Cops Detain 30 US Troops  </HEADLINE>
By KONSTANTIN TESTORIDES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) -- Drunk U.S. soldiers clashed with locals
and police early Wednesday, leading Macedonian authorities and NATO
military police to detain 30 of them, the Macedonian Interior
Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and U.S. military officials confirmed disturbances in three
separate instances involving American troops in Skopje, the
Macedonian capital, but said only five were temporarily detained by
Macedonian police, who later turned them over to U.S. military
authorities. All the Americans were from Kosovo and were on leave
in Skopje, they said.
</P>
<P>
   But later, in a statement released by the public affairs office
at Camp Bondsteel -- the headquarters of U.S. forces in Kosovo --
officials said two soldiers had been held by Macedonian
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''U.S. soldiers on a three-day pass were involved in
altercations that resulted in two soldiers being detained by ...
(Macedonian) police, and four being detained by U.S. military
police,'' the statement said, adding that there were no serious
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   One U.S. military spokesman suggested that in least two of the
cases, the U.S. soldiers did not initiate violence but reacted to
being provoked.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Loomis, a public affairs officer at U.S. European Command in
Stuttgart, Germany, said that in one incident, ''an American
soldier was spit on by a Macedonian, the soldier reacted to that
and was detained by Macedonian police.'' In another, Loomis said,
two American soldiers reacted to foil a Macedonian trying to steal
the belongings of one of the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   In the third incident, ''four soldiers at a restaurant were in
some type of verbal altercation with the staff at the restaurant
and possibly police,'' he said. All four were detained.
</P>
<P>
   Loomis called the report of 30 soldiers being detained ''a
fabrication.''
</P>
<P>
   The Macedonian Interior Ministry statement said the soldiers,
members of NATO-led peacekeeping troops stationed in Macedonia,
were detained in connection with ''indecent behavior, violation of
public order, harassment of citizens and a fight involving a
policeman.'' Some were drunk, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   After a disturbance in a local cafe in downtown Skopje, the
soldiers clashed with a group of citizens, injuring a police
officer who tried to intervene, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, U.S. Maj. Debbie Allen said, ''there were eight U.S.
soldiers involved in three minor incidents.'' She said ''there are
reports of alcohol being involved, and there were altercations.''
</P>
<P>
   All five were back in Kosovo and were being investigated by
military authorities before a decision on whether to file charges,
Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia serves as a staging ground and a supply route for
international peacekeepers in Kosovo. Speaking in Skopje for KFOR,
the NATO-led peacekeeping force, Capt. Andreas Reinecke said KFOR
''deeply regrets these incidents.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We would like to make this very clear that this kind of
behavior does not reflect the attitude that we expect from our
personnel,'' Reinecke said.

<HEADLINE> 'Rose': An Exhausting Account  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA, AP Drama Critic
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Survivor.
</P>
<P>
   There certainly isn't a better word to describe the title
character in ''Rose,'' Martin Sherman's exhausting account of one
woman's journey through 20th-century Jewish life.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm inching towards dust, and sometimes I wish it'd hurry,''
this 80-year-old wonder says, commenting on her imminent demise.
But before she goes, Rose has a story to tell, a solo saga that
fills Broadway's Lyceum Theater for more than two hours.
</P>
<P>
   It's a trip packed with so much detail -- and enough monumental
incidents -- that you often lose sight of the character and focus
instead on the next big event that will envelop her. For all its
narrative, the tale is strangely superficial, despite the
emotionalism of its subject matter.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Rose is played by Olympia Dukakis, an actress of
enormous charm and commonsense, not to mention stamina and
solidity. She anchors Sherman's drama even when it threatens to get
overwhelmed by history.
</P>
<P>
   Dukakis sits for the entire play on a wooden bench in Rose's
present-day Miami Beach apartment -- and talks. The old lady is
sitting shiva, mourning a death that is never fully explained until
the end of the play.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, Rose is back in her Russian childhood, describing
her parents. There's a hypochondriac father, who one day took to
his bed and then never stopped dying. And her saint-like mother
who, even in the face of famine, made sure there was food on the
table. And there are the pogroms, Cossacks on big horses and with
big whips, destroying everything in sight.
</P>
<P>
   These details are among the best in the play, but Sherman has
eight decades of history to cover, so he quickly moves on. When
Rose follows her brother to Warsaw, she meets Yussel, a painter and
the one true love of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Their marriage as well as their young daughter's life ends in
the Warsaw Ghetto during World War II. After the war, Rose finds
herself in Germany and then on a ship, traveling to Palestine. On
board, she meets an American named Sonny Rose. Her stay in the
Mideast is brief, but she marries Sonny and gets the unlikely full
name of Rose Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Sonny brings Rose to America and a new life, renting beach
chairs along the boardwalk at Atlantic City. After the birth of a
son, the marriage falters, but Rose doesn't, eventually getting a
job managing the kitchen at the Majestic Hotel. When Atlantic City
declines, Rose finds new employment -- and eventually a new husband
-- in Miami Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Rose's son, Abbie, finds his way to Israel -- and eventually so
does Rose, as a visitor. She becomes embroiled in disputes over the
West Bank, and finds herself a supporter of Palestinian rights.
</P>
<P>
   Alienated by the violence, Rose wonders where she fits in, if
not in Israel. ''Maybe there is a joy in not belonging ... a
restless people produces restless minds,'' she sighs.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, ''Rose'' has to depend on the considerable talent of
Dukakis to turn this history lesson into a celebration of the
toughness of the human spirit. The actress embodies that strength,
something that ''Rose'' -- the play -- only hints at.

<HEADLINE> Bolivian Protests Subside  </HEADLINE>
By PETER McFARREN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) -- Shops and schools in Cochabamba reopened
Wednesday as a week of violent anti-government protests that had
shut down Bolivia's third largest city subsided and a nationwide
strike to protest a presidential ''state of siege'' decree fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   In La Paz, several hundred students threw stones at police who
responded with tear gas in the second straight day of clashes. The
skirmishes lasted several hours before winding down.
</P>
<P>
   But protests eased across most of the country after the
government and protest leaders reached a deal late Monday to end
the violent protests led by thousands of farmers and workers angry
over government proposed water rate hikes.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bolivian capital, turnout was meager for a 24-hour
general strike called Wednesday by the Bolivian Workers
Confederation, the country's largest union confederation, in
defiance of the stage of siege decreed by President Hugo Banzer on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Banzer called for the security crackdown after weekend protests
turned violent, leaving six dead. Still in effect, the state of
siege suspended many constitutional guarantees, allowing police to
detain protest leaders without a warrant, restricting travel and
political activity and establishing a curfew.
</P>
<P>
   The protests erupted April 3 in Cochabamba, 350 miles east of La
Paz, over the water price hike and then spread to rural regions,
fueled by the economic crisis in South America's poorest nation.
Cochabamba was isolated and shut down by roadblocks and violence
for a week, and peasants in the countryside shut down virtually all
intercity traffic.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, schools reopened in the city of 500,000, as
did businesses and markets.
</P>
<P>
   For Banzer, the weeklong protests have been the biggest test of
his presidency since assuming elected office in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Talks mediated by the Roman Catholic Church continued Wednesday
between the government and worker groups to end any remaining
protests. Road blocks continued Wednesday in an area north of La
Paz where violent confrontations took place over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The protests began with a strike by a Water Rights Committee
against water price increases of 20 to 80 percent, which the
government said were necessary to expand the city's water supply
system and help build a $70 million dollar tunnel to carry water
across the Andes Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement that ended the protests, the government
canceled the contract for the water expansion projection with an
international water consortium, and it revised a water law to end
fees for well water.
</P>
<P>
   ''The economic crisis Bolivia and the region has been going
through no doubt contributed to the problems here,'' Information
Minister Ronald MacLean told The Associated Press. ''When a crisis
hits us we do not have a cushion to absorb its impact.''

<HEADLINE> Celebrity Adviser Held Without Bail  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A financial adviser to young celebrities was
ordered held without bail Wednesday after he was accused of
preparing to flee the country with an expired passport, a bag of
cash and $44,000 in airline tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney David Lewis said Dana Giacchetto, 37,
was arrested shortly before 2 a.m. at Newark International Airport
as he returned from Las Vegas with federal agents closing in on
him.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said the government had alerted the FBI in Honolulu, Las
Vegas and Los Angeles to track Giacchetto down after learning he
had purchased thousands of dollars in plane tickets to destinations
worldwide on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Giacchetto, whose clients included Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben
Stiller and Courtney Cox Arquette, also was tapping funds ordered
frozen by a federal judge after he was charged with swindling his
clients out of millions of dollars while managing their money and
joining their swanky parties, Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Magistrate Judge James C. Francis said Giacchetto was a
''substantial risk of flight'' and revoked his $1 million bail,
ordering him held in prison until trial.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor said what federal investigators found on
Giacchetto was ''quite extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Levander, Giacchetto's lawyer, said his client was not
trying to flee the country and was merely using the expired
passport as identification because he needed a picture
identification card to travel on a plane.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, accusing prosecutors of overreacting, said his
client earlier this week ''was shocked to find out he was wanted
and immediately came back.''
</P>
<P>
   The government alleges Giacchetto stole as much as $5 million
from the band Phish and its members and a million dollars more from
others while misappropriating as much as $20 million entrusted to
him.
</P>
<P>
   He also was accused of issuing fake portfolio statements and
other false documents to clients who wanted proof of their
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Giacchetto is charged with securities fraud and with making
false statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission. If
convicted, he could face a decade in prison and $12 million in
fines.
</P>
<P>
   He allegedly committed the crimes while serving celebrities
including Matt Damon, Cameron Diaz and singer Alanis Morrisette
with an investment business, The Cassandra Group, run from a SoHo
loft.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Agents Found Dead in Baja  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Three Mexican special agents were found dead
in Baja California state, their bruised and battered bodies
possibly left as a warning message by the powerful drug cartel they
were investigating, authorities said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Herran Salvatti, head of the anti-drug unit at the
attorney general's office, said the deaths may have been a message
to authorities from the powerful Arellano Felix Brothers' cartel to
''not to mess with their territory,'' which includes Baja
California and three other Pacific Coast states.
</P>
<P>
   Herran Salvatti said the battered bodies of the agents were
found Tuesday evening in their white Chevrolet van, which had
overturned on an embankment along the Rumorosa Highway that links
the border city of Tijuana with Mexicali, the state capital of
northern Baja California.
</P>
<P>
   The highway runs just south of the Mexico-U.S. border.
</P>
<P>
   The agents were identified as Oscar Poma Plaza, 48, and Jose
Luis Patino Moreno, 47, and Cap. Rafael Torres Bernal, for whom no
age was given. All three were members of Herran Salvatti's unit and
had been probing the activities of the Arellano Felix cartel.
</P>
<P>
   The cartel is considered one of the largest and most violent in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The exact cause of death was unknown pending an autopsy, but the
bodies bore no signs of having been shot, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Herran Salvatti said the three agents were gathering evidence
against Jesus Labra Aviles, 50, who is suspected of being a major
figure in the drug cartel.
</P>
<P>
   Labra was recently placed under house arrest on a court warrant
pending formal charges for racketeering, drug trafficking and money
laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Gustavo Galvez Reyes, his lawyer, was found dead March 15 in
Mexico City with his hands and feet tied and a plastic bag covering
his head.
</P>
<P>
   The agents' apparent slayings are the latest in a series of
apparently drug-related homicides in Mexico in recent weeks.

<HEADLINE> French ambassador's legacy: best places to snooze at the UN  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations is known for its
marathon talkfests that can put even the most seasoned diplomats to
sleep. Now there's hope for an antidote.
</P>
<P>
   Former French Ambassador Alain Dejammet has done a service to
all his colleagues by writing a 14-page, tongue-in-cheek guide to
the best places at U.N. headquarters to escape the boredom and
catch a catnap.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sleeping at the United Nations,'' a pocket-sized guide in
French with a little kitty on the cover, was one of Dejammet's
parting gifts before leaving the post in March for a new
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, the dry-witted ambassador ranks 12 lounges,
consultation rooms and sitting areas around the U.N. complex on a
scale of 1-20 for their comfort, light, calmness and frequency of
use.
</P>
<P>
   Dejammet then gives an overall ranking, ranging from
''ill-advised,'' (known by its symbol of !!!) to ''exceptional''
(which gets a **** ranking).
</P>
<P>
   ''Impression of being in an abandoned monastery, in spite of the
snores,'' Dejammet wrote of the periodical room at the U.N.
library, which got three stars: very agreeable.
</P>
<P>
   The conference room of the European Union liaison office got
high marks for comfort: ''Abundance of coffee and delicious little
cakes.''
</P>
<P>
   But it lost points for calmness. ''Even without meetings, a nap
can be interrupted at any moment by the sudden arrival of an
Eurocrat demanding details of the French position concerning the
promotion of rights of young girls in crises affecting landlocked
countries,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Meditation Room, which sits across the street from U.N.
headquarters, got the worst score. Its blue Chagall windows evoke a
''draculesque crypt,'' while the squeaking sneakers of tourists
allow for little meditation, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Only the French office at the United Nations, which is used for
private consultations, earned four stars and the unflinching praise
of Dejammet who evoked a Matisse masterpiece in saying it was where
everything was ''luxe, calme et volupte.''
</P>
<P>
   ''One speaks of old ministers who never reappeared after a
conference in the 'little bureau','' he said nostalgically.
</P>
<P>
   It got marks of 20 all around, ''but the price to pay was the
risk incurred of being a member of the French delegation,'' added
Dejammet, who himself wasn't known to have dozed off during long
debates or conferences.
</P>
<P>
   The book could be a best seller among U.N. diplomats -- but
Dejammet hasn't disclosed whether he plans to publish it. He first
shared it with the French newspaper Le Monde.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy U.S. Ambassador Nancy Soderberg said Wednesday copies had
already been circulated and discussed among council members and
that she considered it a ''whimsical legacy'' that Dejammet had
left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time I go into a corner of the U.N. I will think of
Alain Dejammet with renewed delight,'' she told reporters. Dejammet
was one of the hardest working diplomats at the United Nations
''and no one begrudges him a moment's rest in a quiet corner where
you all can't find him,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Upstate officials call for federal help on Indian land claims  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Officials from seven upstate New York counties
lobbied lawmakers on Capitol Hill Wednesday for federal help with
their battle over Indian land claims.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, a Democrat, and Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, a
Republican, pledged support with getting negotiations over the
Oneida land claim back on track. Those talks broke down last week.
And the lawmakers promised to again press the Justice Department to
remove landowners there from a federal lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to try and ask the Justice Department to be more
of a mediator than a plaintiff, in other words to recognize that
there are two sides to this,'' Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Oneidas filed a lawsuit in 1974 seeking the return of
250,000 acres in Oneida and Madison counties they claim were
illegally purchased by the state. In 1998, the federal government
sided with the Oneidas and filed an amended complaint asking that
20,000 landowners in the two counties be added as defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have said they have no intention of removing
the property owners from their land. But that has done little to
soothe fears.
</P>
<P>
   ''Landowners are innocent third parties to these land claims and
need to be left out of these claims ... so they don't have to worry
about in any way the security of their homes and their
businesses,'' Oneida County Executive Ralph Eannace Jr. said after
meeting with Schumer, Boehlert and staff members from a handful of
other New York lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Oneida County, elected representatives from
Madison, Cayuga, Seneca, Greene, Onondaga and Sullivan counties
were in Washington Wednesday. The county lawmakers also met with
officials from the Justice Department's Indian Resources Section.
</P>
<P>
   Justice spokeswoman Christine Romano said Wednesday ''we are
convinced settlement is in the best interest of all the parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Oneida Indian officials did not immediately return a phone call
seeking comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   There are several land claim battles brewing in New York
covering a wide swath of land upstate.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a federal court jury in Syracuse recommended a $36.9
million award to the Cayugas to compensate the tribe for 64,015
acres of lost ancestral lands in Cayuga and Seneca counties. A
final judgment on the award will be made by a judge this summer.
</P>
<P>
   In Madison and Oneida counties, the U.S. Supreme Court found in
1985 that the land was taken illegally and ruled the Oneidas were
entitled to compensation. Last week, out-of-court negotiations
collapsed. Settlement Master Ron Riccio called an impasse saying
not every party was committed to the process.
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert, from Oneida County, said he was encouraged because
federal officials had told him that the Oneida Indians were subject
to the Clean Water Act and needed a federal permit to dredge in
Oneida Lake. The Indian tribe has claimed that they did not need
federal permits.
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert said he was hopeful negations cold resume over the
Oneida dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ''The best way is negotiation not litigation,'' Boehlert said.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Bullock who attended the meeting for Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're not at the table you can't make any progress. At the
very least we would like to see negotiations start up again,''
Moynihan's chief of staff said.

<HEADLINE> Nine arrested in methamphetamine ring that operated from Phillybarbershop  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODBURY, N.J. (AP) -- Nine people were arrested Wednesday in a
series of raids that authorities said dismantled a methamphetamine
ring that operated out of a south Philadelphia barber shop.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was Louis Santaguida, 53, of Philadelphia, the
brother of noted criminal defense attorney Joseph Santaguida, who
has defended numerous people accused of being members of the
Philadelphia-southern New Jersey mafia.
</P>
<P>
   Two pounds of methamphetamine, 8.5 pounds of marijuana, $193,000
in cash and three firearms were seized in the raids, according to
U.S. Attorney Robert Cleary, who announced the arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ''We dismantled a major methamphetamine ring that has, up until
now, operated unscathed in Pennsylvania and New Jersey,'' Cleary
said.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests wrapped up an 11-month probe that began with a tip
developed in a drug arrest in Clementon. While they wouldn't say
who gave it, representatives of the federal Drug Enforcement
Administration, the Philadelphia district attorney's office and the
Gloucester County Prosecutor said the information led them to a
drug ring centered at Rocco and Elmer's Hair Styling, located on
Seventh Street in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hair cutting was not the chief business at Rocco and
Elmer's,'' said Cleary, who called it a front for the alleged ring.
Philadelphia District Attorney Lynne Abraham said the ring was
selling ''poison in our communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Using telephone wiretaps, undercover agents and surveillance,
agents cracked the ring, Cleary said. On six different occasions,
undercover agents bought ''meth'' or ''crank'' -- as it is known
among users -- from members of the ring for up to $12,000 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects used code language to disguise their conversations,
but one wiretap caught Louis Grosso, 36, of Havertown, Pa., asking,
''You got anybody that needs meth? The crank, the meth?''
</P>
<P>
   The first buy came June 17 at the Lindenwold apartment of
Richard Zammer, 34, according to a criminal complaint filed against
Louis Santaguida and naming the others.
</P>
<P>
   The supplier was identified as Sammy Bonaccurso, 55, of
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Santaguida and Billy Cicalese, 54, of Philadelphia,
distributed the methamphetamine to the others for sale in New
Jersey and Pennsylvania, according to a criminal complaint filed
against Santaguida.
</P>
<P>
   All nine were charged with conspiracy to distribute and
possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine. Each could
face 10 years to life in prison, and $4 million in fines, if
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   One suspect remained at large. He is Thomas Sees, 36, of
Williamstown.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the nine charged federally, Joan Gallagher, 35,
of Cherry Hill, was charged with third-degree possession of
marijuana and methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   Cleary would not say whether a mob link was suspected in the
drug sales. Asked about Louis Santaguida's relationship to the
lawyer Santaguida, he would say only: ''I don't really want to get
into that. People's familial relationships are not what this case
is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if any of the suspects were members of organized crime,
Cleary said: ''Not as charged.'' Joseph Santaguida, who has
defended alleged mob boss Joseph ''Skinny Joey'' Merlino, couldn't
be reached for comment about the arrests; he did not return a
telephone call to his law office.
</P>
<P>
   They were arrested at 17 locations -- their homes and/or
businesses, Cleary said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Louis Santaguida, Cicalese, Bonaccurso, Grosso,
Sees and Zammer, the suspects were identified as Vincent Gori, age
unavailable, of Turnersville; Theodore Iannone, 43, of Egg Harbor
Township; and Dominick Imbesi, 49, of Philadelphia.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Publisher Barred From Ukraine  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- The American publisher of an
English-language newspaper in Ukraine was barred from entering the
country for one year, the border guards' command said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the border guards said Jed Sunden was barred
following ''a decision from one of the competent organs.'' In
Ukraine, the phrase usually refers to security services.
</P>
<P>
   Ukraine's State Security Service declined comment on the case
and the Foreign Ministry said it had nothing to do with the
decision to bar Sunden, who founded the Kyiv Post weekly in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The refusal comes two days ahead of U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright's planned visit to Kiev.
</P>
<P>
   Sunden, speaking in a telephone interview from Kiev's Boryspil
Airport, said he arrived Tuesday afternoon and was told he could
not enter the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''This action on the eve of the visit of Madeleine Albright
could be seen as part of a larger crackdown on free press and
economic reform,'' Sunden said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunden said he had heard unofficially that Ukrainian authorities
had placed him on a blacklist on March 31, two days after he left
the country for a visit home.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Embassy spokeswoman in Kiev, said the embassy had
expressed concern to senior Ukrainian government officials and
asked for immediate explanations.
</P>
<P>
   Centrist and leftist opposition media in Ukraine have long
accused President Leonid Kuchma's government of trying to suppress
them. The government says many media outlets make persecution
charges in order to cover their own professional and financial
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   The Kyiv Post doesn't have a history of clashes with the
government, and is not affiliated with the political and financial
groups that control many media outlets in Ukraine.

<HEADLINE> Franks takes lead over Gormley in county endorsements for GOPprimary  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- In a primary race in which the candidates
are little known, securing endorsements from county Republican
organizations could be crucial in deciding who becomes the GOP
nominee to run for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In this aspect of the contest, U.S. Rep. Bob Franks, R-Berkeley
Heights, has a clear lead over state Sen. William Gormley,
R-Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Franks won the nomination in Bergen County last weekend, the
largest prize of the state's 21 counties. There are 98,000
registered Republicans there, almost 12 percent of the state's
total.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, Bergen is an important win. Last week, Franks
and Gormley were neck-and-neck with county endorsements and both
were competitive in Bergen, where Gormley had the backing of a
popular county executive and three Republican state senators.
</P>
<P>
   With the win there, Franks comes away with party endorsements in
six counties representing 275,000 registered Republicans, compared
with four counties endorsing Gormley that represent 169,000
registered Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first run was endorsements and county support, and Franks
got the big prize, which was Bergen County,'' said Republican
political analyst Steve Salmore. ''At this stage he is up.''
</P>
<P>
   It is worth something, political analysts agree, but it does not
end the contest.
</P>
<P>
   On defensive tactics, the Bergen County win was gratifying for
Franks, who has managed to prevent his Margate opponent from
winning any endorsements north of Trenton. Meanwhile, Franks has
secured endorsements in the southern New Jersey counties of
Burlington and Cumberland.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican organizations in a third of the state's 21
counties, including large GOP counties like Morris and Monmouth,
have not endorsed a favorite, and will not. They will remain
''open.'' And they represent roughly one of every three registered
Republicans in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Those open primary zones provide plenty of opportunity for
Gormley, Essex County executive James Treffinger or renegade
Republican Murray Sabrin to draw the votes needed to reduce the
margins that Franks may win in the counties where his name gets
preferential treatment on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Also, political analysts disagree on just how important county
endorsements will prove to be on June 6. Until recently such ballot
endorsement was prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   Further, there is the unknown factor of how many new
unaffiliated voters will be drawn to the primary election as the
contest heats up.
</P>
<P>
   As of November, there were 843,534 registered Republicans in New
Jersey, compared with 1.1 million registered Democrats. Swamping
both are the 2.5 million registered voters who have chosen not to
list themselves with either party. They are free to walk into the
primary election booth and to vote in either party's primary
without notice, and their potential impact in a year with a high
voter turnout can be large.
</P>
<P>
   ''Generally in a presidential election year the turnout seems to
be greater, and this year seems to be no different,'' said state
GOP chairman Garabed Haytaian. ''It is not just the (county)
activists who are going to be involved on Primary Day, it is
everyone who comes into play, including independents who might want
to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Franks' county endorsements give him an edge with 275,000
Republican voters but those counties also are home to 900,000
unaffiliated voters, and any fraction of them could affect the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Salmore noted, the most potent spoiler -- with a
credible chance of an upset win -- is Treffinger, and he will do
most of his spoiling in Franks country. Treffinger has secured the
Essex and Passaic county endorsements, accounting for 89,000
registered Republicans. And he is favored to win endorsement in
Hudson County.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Jim McQueeny said Treffinger has no incentive
to drop out, even if the primary race seems hopeless, because he is
building a base to run for Congress in Essex and Passaic counties
in 2002.

<HEADLINE> Advanced Micro Devices Soars  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNNYVALE, Calif.(AP) -- A powerful profit report by Advanced
Micro Devices, the No. 2 chipmaker after Intel, blew past Wall
Street forecasts on Wednesday, a stark contrast to sudden jitters
about computer sales that helped send stocks tumbling.
</P>
<P>
   The first-quarter profit of $189 million, nearly double what
many brokerages expected, followed some market-rattling comments
earlier in the day by a top analyst who said Microsoft's sales are
being hurt by weaker demand for personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   But after the close of Wednesday's stock trading, AMD reported
that it sold 1.2 million of its speedy Athlon microprocessors in
the quarter, a 50 percent increase from last year, as the company
grabbed a larger share of the market for PCs costing less than
$1,000.
</P>
<P>
   AMD's stock fell sharply before the report, dropping $6.12{ per
share to $64.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. But in extended
trading on other markets, the stock soared as high as $75.
</P>
<P>
   The jump in Athlon sales accounted for the bulk of a record
revenue tally of $1.09 billion, which was a 73 percent improvement
from AMD's sales in the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   AMD's profit for the first three months of 2000 amounted to a
per-share profit of $1.15 a share, which compared with a year-ago
loss of $128 million, or 88 cents per share, in first quarter of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   The once-struggling company's improving fortunes have been
fueled by rising demand for lower-priced PCs, which have emerged as
the fastest growing part of the computer market as households buy
their first and second machines.

<HEADLINE> Deal Reached on Transplant Proposal  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration and senators struck
a deal Wednesday that would give a panel of medical experts final
say over how the nation distributes scarce organs to thousands of
waiting patients.
</P>
<P>
   Backers hoped the compromise, set for quick Senate action, would
settle a battle over who has power to set transplant policy. The
Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee unanimously
approved the legislation Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal's fate was far from clear in the House, where last week
lawmakers passed a bill giving the private company that runs the
transplant system sole power over policy. And marrying the Senate
version with that in the House would be like trying to ''cross a
Chihuahua with a Great Dane,'' said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has been conflict, there has been debate, there has been
disagreement, there has been anger,'' said Sen. Bill Frist,
R-Tenn., a former heart and lung transplant surgeon who fashioned
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said in a statement issued Wednesday that he was pleased
by Frist and Kennedy's announcement that a compromise had been
reached.
</P>
<P>
   ''This compromise takes a first step towards ensuring that those
Americans most in need of receiving these life-saving resources
will be able to better access them,'' Clinton said. ''At the same
time, we must redouble our efforts to encourage voluntary donation
by all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation does not address the substance of the argument:
whether organs should be offered first to patients who live near
the donor, as in the current system, or go to the sickest patients
first, even if they live elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it sets up a mediation system to settle disputes between
the Department of Health and Human Services and the private
contractor that runs the system. An outside panel of experts would
have the power to make final decisions on policy, based on legal
principles.
</P>
<P>
   In the compromise, Frist agreed to add a provision making it
clear that the distribution system should work to reduce geographic
disparities in the system.
</P>
<P>
   HHS complains that the current system, which relies heavily on
geography, is unfair because patients in certain parts of the
country have a better chance at getting a transplant.
</P>
<P>
   HHS and the United Network for Organ Sharing, which runs the
system, have been at odds for more than a decade, but their dispute
erupted two years ago when HHS directed the network to rewrite its
rules to get more organs to the sickest patients.
</P>
<P>
   The network balked that HHS should get the final say over
medical decisions and complained that smaller hospitals would lose
organs to the larger centers under the HHS plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Frist-Kennedy legislation allows the transplant network to
write policy. But if the sides cannot agree, an expert committee
would make the final policy decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-member committee will be comprised of seven people
nominated by HHS, by the transplant network and by the independent
Institute of Medicine. The network and the IOM will each nominate
12 people and the HHS secretary will choose from among their lists.
</P>
<P>
   Some transplant centers were already upset by that provision.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be rather easy for the secretary to achieve a
majority for whatever opinion or policy she would put forward,''
said Dr. Tony D'Alessandro, who directs the transplant program at
the University of Wisconsin-Madison and leads a group opposed to
the HHS regulations.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials said they have an understanding
with Frist that they will not compromise further.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, at least, all sides appeared ready to move ahead
with the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., has been one of HHS's fiercest
opponents, voted for the legislation, saying, ''It's time for the
(transplant) community to get back to what they do best --
medicine.''

<HEADLINE> House Chaplain Mass Angers Democrats  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER LOVEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Democratic congressman who also is Roman
Catholic said Wednesday the Republican Party trivialized the
worship service of his faith by organizing a Mass in honor of the
new House chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech on the House floor, Rep. Jerry Kleczka of Wisconsin
called it inappropriate for a political organization to sponsor
events using the church and its rituals as if they were the same as
a fund-raising dinner or rally.
</P>
<P>
   ''For them to use the Catholic church in a continuing attempt to
attract Catholic voters is, I think, disgusting,'' Kleczka said in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Kleczka was particularly offended that Republican National
Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson and former Rep. Bill Paxon,
R-N.Y., the one-time head of House Republicans' campaign arm, were
readers during Tuesday's service.
</P>
<P>
   RNC spokesman Mike Collins repeated that the Mass, and a
reception afterward at St. Peter's Church on Capitol Hill, were
never an attempt to score political points but only an opportunity
to meet the Rev. Daniel P. Coughlin, who was appointed last month
as the first Catholic House chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think his constituents will find it very interesting that
Congressman Kleczka will find a Mass disgusting,'' Collins said.
''He should be ashamed of himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Catholic GOP congressmen were invited, though all lawmakers
were given media advisories.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats had accused GOP leaders of anti-Catholic bigotry
because they at first appeared to pass over a priest with broader
support in favor of a Protestant for the chaplain post.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., repeatedly denied the
charges. His initial choice, a Protestant minister, eventually
withdrew and the speaker unexpectedly appointed Coughlin, from
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Democrats are accusing the RNC of organizing the Mass and
reception as a way to mend fences with Catholics, a large block of
voters who were bruised by the highly divisive and bitter selection
process. Even some GOP aides said they view the events as an
embarrassing blunder by the RNC.

<HEADLINE> Israel: UN To Determine Border  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak is ready to let the
United Nations determine the final border between Israel and
Lebanon, a senior Israeli official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The offer -- a rare Israeli concession -- is aimed at pressing
Lebanon to secure the border once Israel pulls out.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has said he will withdraw Israeli troops from Lebanon by
July, preferably as part of an agreement with Lebanon and Syria --
the main power in Lebanon -- but unilaterally if need be. Israel has
occupied parts of Lebanon since a 1982 invasion.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli official, who spoke on condition he not be named,
said Israel regards the international border as the line to which
it withdrew its forces after a brief invasion of Lebanon in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the United Nations affirmed the legitimacy of that
border, said the official, who briefed reporters on Barak's plane
as the prime minister returned from talks with President Clinton in
Washington. Israel is willing, however, to let U.N. inspectors make
the final ruling that the pullback is complete.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there is an argument about ten meters (yards) here or
there, we will retreat,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United Nations has yet to comment on the proposal,
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan recently told Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy he would explore ways of making the withdrawal
a success.
</P>
<P>
   Syria and Lebanon have said they will only recognize the
withdrawal as valid if it is carried out according to U.N.
resolutions. Those resolutions call on Lebanon to prevent attacks
on Israel from its soil -- a commitment the Lebanese have so far
refused to make.
</P>
<P>
   Talks with Syria have broken down over Israel's refusal to offer
a prior commitment to withdraw from all of the Golan Heights, a
strategic plateau captured from Syria in the 1967 war. Barak has
made strong indications that he plans to return the heights, but
wants to retain control over a freshwater lake that supplies 40
percent of Israel's water.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, however, is concerned Syria will allow or even encourage
Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas to attack targets inside Israel
after a pullout from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the Israeli official said, Israel expects
international backing if it has to retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   Barak secured U.S. backing for the withdrawal in his Washington
meetings with Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is strange that a country is criticized for withdrawing
from another country,'' Albright said of reactions from Lebanon and
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon has also said that if a withdrawal is to conform to the
U.N. resolutions it should account for the hundreds of thousands of
Palestinian refugees in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Barak agreed that claim would no longer hold, the
official said, should Israel and the Palestinians meet a May
deadline to agree on the outline of a permanent peace treaty -- an
outline that would address the refugee problem.
</P>
<P>
   In Lebanon on Wednesday, Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas
said they used rockets in an attack on militiamen of the South
Lebanon Army at their Rihan outpost on the edge of an
Israeli-occupied enclave, scoring direct hits.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese security officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed the afternoon attack killed one militiaman and wounded
another, who was evacuated to Israel for treatment.

<HEADLINE> Freight Carrier Has Cash Concerns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Shares of air-freight carrier Kitty
Hawk plummeted more than 80 percent Wednesday after the company
warned investors it could soon run out of cash.
</P>
<P>
   Kitty Hawk said in a statement late Tuesday that it will be
forced to restate its 1999 profits and report a larger
first-quarter loss than analysts had expected. It also said
accounting firm Ernst &AMP; Young will report that it cannot assure
stockholders the company can remain in business.
</P>
<P>
   Kitty Hawk said it is working with lenders to restructure its
debt and is looking for buyers of some of its assets.
</P>
<P>
   Investors seized on the news and began selling heavily. Kitty
Hawk shares were down about 80 percent, sliding $3.59] to 90| cents
at 4 p.m. Wednesday on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The stock hit a
52-week high of $14.12{ in September.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport,
serves about 45 U.S. cities and operates in South America and the
Pacific Rim. Among its customers are the U.S. Postal Service, the
U.S. military and major passenger airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The company struggled after the 1997 acquisition of Kalitta
Cos., which included a money-losing airfreight carrier. It closed a
charter passenger-service line and cut jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Kitty Hawk blamed its problems this week on soft sales of
freight services and heavy aircraft-maintenance costs.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it is in default on engine-maintenance
agreements included in its contracts for wide-body jets and might
have to spend $35 million -- money it doesn't have -- to fix the
problem. The company also said it expects to miss a $17 million
interest payment due May 15.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Tate, who joined Kitty Hawk on April 1 as senior vice
president and chief financial officer, has resigned, the company
said. The company said Tate is expected to continue as a
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Founder and chief executive Tom Christopher owns about 35
percent of the company.

<HEADLINE> Senegalese Dancers AWOL in U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By KIM CURTIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Seventeen members of a Senegalese dance
troupe walked off the stage and disappeared in the San Francisco
Bay area, forcing organizers to cancel the remainder of their U.S.
tour.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, none had filed for political asylum from Senegal --
which ended 40 years of socialist rule this month. They were in
this country under temporary work permits that allowed them only to
work as dancers for their company.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've disappeared,'' said Jane Hermann of New York-based ICM
Artists Ltd., which had to cancel the group's three remaining U.S.
performances. ''It's too bad because it's such a lovely tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Riordan, who works for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service in San Francisco, said: ''It's our duty to try and locate
them and try to remove them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballet d'Afrique Noire had crisscrossed the country since
January, and was nearing the end its 12-week U.S. tour when the
dancers performed Sunday at Berkeley's Zellerbach Hall to a crowd
of 1,700.
</P>
<P>
   After the performance, 17 of the 28 dancers walked off the
stage, mingled with the crowd, and melted away.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they've been misguided by friends who live here,''
Hermann said. ''I know they have friends in the Bay Area. They were
swarming backstage. Nobody can just disappear in the United States
unless they have friends who can help them.''
</P>
<P>
   Troupe members were supposed to board a bus at noon Monday for
Palm Desert, then travel to scheduled performances in Arizona. Only
11 of the dancers showed up. The other dancers and musicians,
mostly in their 20s, were nowhere to be found.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the remaining members of the troupe flew back to
Senegal.
</P>
<P>
   Established in 1958, Ballet d'Afrique Noire is one of Senegal's
oldest active folk music and dance companies. Based in Dakar, the
company trains 150 members each year and regularly sends smaller
ensembles to perform in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The primarily French-speaking nation's political situation has
been relatively stable in recent years, according to the U.S. State
Department. Its longtime opposition leader was sworn in earlier
this month as president, ending 40 years of Socialist Party rule.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Blames Blast on Opposition  </HEADLINE>
By MISHA SAVIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- President Slobodan Milosevic's
ruling Socialists and his police on Wednesday blamed the opposition
for a blast that shook a branch office, further raising tensions
ahead of a major anti-Milosevic rally.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured, but the blast shattered windows in the
building and throughout the Belgrade neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a terrorist act by those who are an extended hand of
NATO,'' Socialist official Branislav Ivkovic told the state-run
Tanjug news agency. The pro-Milosevic camp commonly accuses
opposition leaders of being stooges of NATO, which is reviled by
many because of its 78-day bombing campaign last year against
Yugoslavia in response to the crackdown against Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Milenko Ercic of the Belgrade police department told
reporters that the explosion ''indicates a possible connection
between foreign intelligence services and certain parties that
would benefit from incidents in Belgrade streets.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a classic terrorist act ... it is no coincidence that it
happened ahead of the opposition rally,'' Ercic said, referring to
plans by anti-Milosevic forces to stage large protests on Friday.
He added that the opposition will be held ''fully responsible'' for
any possible violence on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   An opposition party, the Vojvodina Coalition, directly blamed
the Socialists for staging the explosion because ''it is only in
the regime's interest to start a violent showdown with democratic
forces in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Vladan Batic, a leader of the main opposition umbrella group
Alliance for Change, also accused the Socialists, saying, ''they
did this comic event ... themselves.''

<HEADLINE> Controversy Over S. African Land  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) -- About 20 landless farm workers
threatened on Wednesday to seize white-owned land if the Land
Affairs minister did not meet with them in coming days.
</P>
<P>
   The men, who are among the 27 percent of black South African
families living on land they neither rent nor own, said they were
inspired by the recent takeovers in neighboring Zimbabwe of more
than 1,000 white-owned farms.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to take action like Zimbabwe -- we can't survive to see
our family fighting for land to live on,'' said Thomas Dladla, one
of the protesters from northeastern South Africa's Mpumalanga
Province.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters carried sticks, a traditional shield and posters,
one of which said in Zulu: ''What is happening in Zimbabwe is going
to happen in Mpumalanga.''
</P>
<P>
   The men gathered outside a government building in downtown
Pretoria and demanded to see Land Affairs Minister Thoko Didiza. A
spokesman for Didiza said she was unable to immediately meet with
the protesters because she was in Cape Town. The protesters then
demanded that Didiza meet with them by Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   After apartheid ended with South Africa's first all-race
elections in 1994, then-President Nelson Mandela assured landless
blacks that their conditions would improve.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 40,000 individual and community land claims have been
filed with the government by a deadline that expired 15 months ago,
but many of the claims have not been settled yet.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Secret Service Under Fire  </HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A former Israeli attorney general told a
newspaper in comments published Wednesday that the Shin Bet
security service should be stripped of its right to interrogate
suspects because it has inappropriately used force against them.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ben-Yair said that when he was attorney general from
1993 to 1997, the Shin Bet abused authorization he granted to use
mild physical force in specific circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, the Shin Bet used physical force against
Palestinian suspects ''routinely, every day and all the time.''
Ben-Yair confirmed the comments reported in the Israeli Haaretz
daily.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Shin Bet should be restricted to gathering
intelligence, while interrogation of suspects should be conducted
only by the police.
</P>
<P>
   His statements follow a September 1999 Supreme Court decision
banning any use of force by secret service interrogators. The Shin
Bet had previously been allowed to use ''moderate physical
pressure,'' with permission from the attorney general, to extract
information from a suspect about an impending attack.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure included sleep deprivation, violent shaking and
forcing the prisoner to sit in excruciatingly uncomfortable
positions for long periods. Human rights activists maintained that
these methods amounted to torture.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Yair said in 1994, after he granted permission to use mild
force to investigate a bus bombing in Tel Aviv, then-Shin Bet chief
Carmi Gilon began using force routinely.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Yair said he turned against any use of force in 1995, when
Palestinian suspect Abdel Samad Harizat died after being subjected
to violent shaking.
</P>
<P>
   ''My feeling was that the Shin Bet had led me by the nose,''
Ben-Yair said.

<HEADLINE> Food Distributor Loses Burger King  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID KOENIG, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- AmeriServe Food Distribution Inc. said Wednesday
it will lose its account with 5,800 Burger King restaurants,
costing the bankrupt company $2.2 billion of its $6.2 billion in
annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
   AmeriServe chief executive Ronald Rittenmeyer said the company
would lay off 1,400 to 1,600 of its roughly 6,000 employees, or
about 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company also is considering whether it wants to continue as
a stand-along company, merge with a partner or sell some of its
assets, he said.
</P>
<P>
   AmeriServe filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors on
Jan. 31. It received $150 million in temporary financing from its
two largest customers, Burger King and Tricon Global Restaurants
Inc., which operates Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ''While this is unfortunate, you sometimes look at these things
as not a shock,'' said Rittenmeyer of the Burger King defection,
which had been rumored for weeks. ''We will be a smaller company,
but $4 billion is not small.''
</P>
<P>
   Acquisitions that left the company with a heavy debt load caused
the company to miss payments to suppliers, resulting in spot
shortages of food and paper products at some restaurants. The
troubles prompted several customers, including some Burger King
franchisees, to switch to other distributors.
</P>
<P>
   AmeriServe, based in the Dallas suburb of Addison, said
deliveries of food products to Burger King will end in July.
Rittenmeyer said it would not affect the temporary financing, which
runs into August. The company is talking with Chase and Deutsche
Bank about permanent financing.
</P>
<P>
   Rittenmeyer said the company probably won't emerge from
bankruptcy this year.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Burger King leaves Tricon's three restaurant chains
accounting for more than half of AmeriServe's business. Other major
customers are Long John Silver's and Chick-fil-A. Rittenmeyer said
all were committed to stay with AmeriServe.
</P>
<P>
   Tricon and Burger King did not return calls for comment.
</P>
<P>
   AmeriServe got in trouble by expanding too rapidly, with two
major acquisitions in the late 1990s, Rittenmeyer said. Analysts,
however, predict the pattern will be repeated by other
distributors.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's been the history of this industry -- ambitious companies
will attempt to roll up the market faster than is prudent,'' said
Rajan Chaudhry, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. ''They
end up in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaudry said the industry leader, Houston-based Sysco, ''has
been successful because it's balanced its growth and handled
acquisitions carefully. They've been No. 1 for about 20 years, but
No. 2 is always changing. It used to be AmeriServe.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Drug Czar: Treatment Is Key  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE M. PETERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- White House drug czar Barry McCaffrey, an
advocate of methadone therapy, said heroin addicts must be treated
the same as people with other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the American Methadone Treatment Association's
National conference in San Francisco on Wednesday, McCaffrey said
the challenge is making effective, science-based treatment for
addicts more available.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated one million people nationwide are chronic opiate
addicts, but only about 179,000 are in treatment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not talking about a rare tropic disease, we're talking
about a million of our citizens,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Implementation of a national drug policy that addresses heroin
addiction in a more mainstream way won't be easy, McCaffrey
acknowledged. But methadone treatment is key, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is clear to me that there has to be a package, a system, in
the treatment of opiate addiction -- and methadone is an important
part of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Communities across the country have routinely fought methadone
clinics in their neighborhoods, claiming they bring with them crime
and blight. In Antioch, Calif., a federal judge ruled last month
that civil rights law allows a methadone clinic to move into a
residential neighborhood despite the city's claim that it would be
unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   Methadone is a synthetic drug prescribed to blunt the craving
for heroin and ease withdrawal symptoms. Many researchers believe
it is the best hope for recovering heroin addicts, allowing them to
hold down jobs and contribute to society.
</P>
<P>
   Methadone is addictive, but only provides a high for the first
month or so of use. Addicts drink daily doses of the liquid
narcotic.
</P>
<P>
   A report released late last year by a panel of scientists
convened by the National Institutes of Health said heroin abuse is
a treatable disease and urges the expansion of methadone programs.

<HEADLINE> Independent Panel To Probe LAPD  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA DEUTSCH, AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In the wake of a massive scandal in which
officers are alleged to have framed innocent people, the city
Police Commission on Wednesday named an independent panel to
investigate the department and make recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The citizens of Los Angeles have rightly sought an independent
body to investigate the corruption within the police department,''
said Gerald L. Chaleff, president of the Police Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The Rampart Independent Review Panel, 24 experts including
attorneys, professors, management consultants and veterans of the
Christopher Commission probe of the Los Angeles Police Department,
plans to issue its recommendations in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   About two dozen Rampart station officers have quit, been fired
or relieved of duty amid allegations that an anti-gang unit framed,
beat and shot innocent people.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty criminal cases involving arrests by Rampart officers have
already been dismissed, and District Attorney Gil Garcetti said
Wednesday he will seek the dismissal of 10 more on Thursday. The
majority of the new cases involved arrests by disgraced ex-officer
Rafael Perez and partner Nino Durden.
</P>
<P>
   The city is expecting an avalanche of lawsuits as a result of
the scandal. Mayor Richard Riordan proposed using the city's
tobacco settlement money to cover liability. But last month the
City Council rejected his idea and voted to set up a reserve fund,
which remains empty as the mayor tries to reconcile it with his
budget proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of the new panel by the Police Commission, the
civilian body that sets department policy, was immediately
criticized by the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern
California. The ACLU said the panel was not truly independent and
it must release its report directly to the public to be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   The model for the new panel will be the Christopher Commission,
which investigated allegations of brutality and racism in the LAPD
stemming from the Rodney King beating.

<P>
   Chaleff said the group will draw expertise from some of the most
experienced people in the field of criminal justice. All members
are volunteers serving without compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Drooyan, former chief assistant U.S. attorney in Los
Angeles and deputy general counsel for the Christopher Commission,
and Jeffrey Eglash, inspector general of the LAPD, will oversee
eight work groups that will probe specific areas of concern.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are no limits on what this group can do,'' said Drooyan,
who will also be general counsel to the task force.
</P>
<P>
   Panel member Chuck LaBella, former head of the U.S. Justice
Department's Campaign Finance Task Force, told reporters: ''Our
mission is not to become a fig leaf for anyone, to give political
cover. Our mission is to address the systemic problems and change
them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not here as enemies of the LAPD,'' he said. ''We are
here to champion the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporters questioned the small representation of minorities on
the predominantly white male panel.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are reaching out to get more representatives of minority
communities,'' Drooyan said. ''We want our work to have credibility
throughout the entire community.''

   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- South Carolina state senators on Wednesday
approved a bill to remove the Confederate flag from atop the

<HEADLINE> How Elian Deal Went Wrong  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Conflicting accounts emerged Wednesday from
nearly all sides involved in the failed deal to reunite Elian
Gonzalez with his father in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Version One: The Miami relatives had agreed to relinquish the
child to the father.
</P>
<P>
   Version Two: The relatives wanted to meet the father only to
talk about what would be best for the child.
</P>
<P>
   Version Three: The family planned to hand over the child and
then talk the father into defecting to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, agreed to a three-hour meeting
with Miami relatives who have been caring for Elian -- to be held at
the Vatican Embassy in Washington Wednesday -- because he was told
they would relinquish custody of Elian before the meeting, his
lawyer Gregory Craig told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought we had an agreement that ... would have transferred
custody of Elian Gonzalez smoothly, peacefully and in an orderly
fashion,'' Craig said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He said the agreement worked out with help from Sen. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J., and representatives of the Cuban American
National Federation was that Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez
and cousin Marisleysis Gonzalez would fly to Washington with Elian
on Wednesday morning and transfer custody to the father.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their only requirement was that Juan Miguel Gonzalez would be
willing to talk with the relatives after the transfer for 30
minutes,'' said Craig, adding that they were to travel to
Washington in a government plane.
</P>
<P>
   He said the father agreed to the proposal even though it later
changed several times in the evening. The number of relatives
increased from two to six, they wanted to come on a private charter
and they wanted Juan Miguel to talk to them for 180 minutes rather
than 30, Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel accepted this because ''the essential condition that
we cared about -- and that caused us to agree to this proposal
remained unchanged -- that the family meeting would be preceded by
the transfer of Elian's physical and legal custody to his father,''
Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he and his client were surprised by the uncle's midnight
announcement outside his Miami house that he would not be bringing
the child to Washington on Wednesday. They were also surprised by
the Washington news conference Wednesday morning in which Cuban
American National Foundation chairman Jorge Mas Santos said there
had been no agreement to transfer custody of the boy to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Mas Santos told reporters that there were no conditions to the
family meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''The meeting was not to be a handover of Elian,'' he said.
''The meeting was a forum so this family among themselves could
decide as a family what was in the best interest of Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he viewed the meeting as ''a good opportunity for a
family reunion'' among the relatives who have fought for more than
four months for custody of the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli told reporters that the family had, indeed, agreed to
reunite the father and son -- at the Vatican Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   He said the family believed that once they had Juan Miguel on
church property and the chance to talk to him for three hours, he
would agreed to stay in the United States with the boy.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear what made them back out of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the end, emotion overcame logic,'' Torricelli said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there was the false belief by some of the relatives in
Miami that there were still legal options,'' he said. ''And the
large crowd gathered outside the Gonzalez home in Miami turned
against the agreement.''

<HEADLINE> 13,000-Acre Wildfire Burns in Fla.  </HEADLINE>
By VICKIE CHACHERE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPLES, Fla. (AP) -- A 15,400-acre wildfire burned Wednesday
after destroying three mobile homes, forcing evacuations and
closing roads and a school.
</P>
<P>
   Fire crews initially feared ''very aggressive fire behavior'' as
the blaze burned for a fourth day, but wind worked in their favor,
pushing flames into areas that already had burned.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's not too bad. That's much slower progress than we have
had all week,'' state forestry spokesman Gerry LaCavera said
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   An elementary school was closed early Wednesday in the area
about 10 miles east of Naples, or 130 miles south of Tampa.
Residents of 50 homes within a mile of the fire were urged to
evacuate Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   One firefighter suffered heat exhaustion. A fourth brush truck
to be caught by flames was lost Wednesday. None of the trucks'
operators was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of the scorched area is now in ''mop-up,'' with
firefighters working to extinguish small embers and flare-ups,
LaCavera said. The operation is expected to continue for several
days.
</P>
<P>
   The area, dotted with papery melaleuca trees and oil-rich
cabbage palms that have increased firefighters' frustration, was
subdivided in the heyday of Florida swampland sales, leaving miles
of paved roads but few houses.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just kind of sitting on pins and needles waiting to see
what's going to happen,'' said Robert Heed, manager of Kountree
Kampinn RV Resort, about 2{ miles from the edge of the burned area.
</P>
<P>
   The fire started Sunday in the Picayune Strand State Forest,
between Naples and the Big Cypress National Preserve and Everglades
National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Though the cause had not been determined, firefighters believe
it was sparked by humans.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency on Wednesday agreed to
pay 70 percent of the state's eligible firefighting costs above
$1,520,356.

<HEADLINE> Feds Break Up Fake Memorabilia Ring  </HEADLINE>
By BEN FOX, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The Mark McGwire jersey has Major League
Baseball's seal of approval, but the autograph that would boost its
value is as phony as a corked bat.
</P>
<P>
   At least half -- and possibly 90 percent -- of items in the $1
billion sports and celebrity memorabilia market are fake, federal
investigators said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Their three-year probe, dubbed Operation Bullpen, has led to 25
arrests and turned up thousands of photos, baseballs and other
items bearing counterfeit signatures in the largest investigation
yet into the memorabilia industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't tell unless you see it autographed personally or you
know the history of the item,'' said Phillip Halpern, the assistant
U.S. attorney who coordinated Operation Bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   The counterfeit McGwire jersey, priced at $3,995, was displayed
in an FBI storage room Wednesday as federal authorities showed off
results of their probe.
</P>
<P>
   A genuine autographed McGwire jersey would sell for thousands
more, said Richard McWilliams, president of the sports collectibles
company Upper Deck, which assisted the FBI and Internal Revenue
Service in the investigation. McWilliams said his company protects
itself by having a representative witness all signings.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the price doesn't seem to agree to the item, then you've
got to be very careful. Because it's probably too good to be
true,'' McWilliams said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the fakes are sold over the Internet and through
catalogues. But the forgery ring at the center of Operation Bullpen
shipped memorabilia to retailers in at least 15 states, including
Arizona, Oregon, Hawaii, Georgia and New York, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Padres outfielder Tony Gwynn, who assisted investigators, said
he found counterfeit versions of his autograph in one of the team's
official gift stores.
</P>
<P>
   Since the investigation began in 1997, investigators have seized
thousands of items, including a baseball supposedly signed by
Mother Teresa, and fake autographs from Michael Jordan, Albert
Einstein, Abraham Lincoln and Jerry Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI agent posed as a representative of an exporting firm who
wanted to ship collectibles to Asia. The investigation eventually
led authorities to a forgery ring allegedly run by a family in
Escondido.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 25 people charged in the forgery ring were in
Southern California, and as many as 40 more arrests in other states
are expected in the coming months, U.S. Attorney Gregory Vega said.
</P>
<P>
   The forgers searched garage sales for vintage paper and ink, and
hired unscrupulous authenticators to falsely verify their work,
Vega said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the investigation also led him to doubt the authenticity
of items he had purchased for his own sons.
</P>
<P>
   ''As I sit here today I'm wondering if they are counterfeit or
not,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Israel OKs US Involvement in Talks  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- With Israeli-Palestinian peace talks stalled
and crucial deadlines looming, President Clinton has personally
intervened to get Israel's agreement on U.S. mediation of the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Returning from Washington on Wednesday, a senior Israeli
official suggested to reporters aboard Israel's Air Force One that
Clinton left Prime Minister Ehud Barak little choice: the Americans
are ''convinced the Palestinian track must be accelerated,'' the
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak had resisted U.S. efforts to
mediate until his visit to Washington on Tuesday at Clinton's
behest.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak was not in much of a position to resist Clinton's
attempts at persuasion: a year after the Israeli prime minister won
power promising a comprehensive peace by the end of this year,
talks with the Syrians -- and their Lebanese proxies -- are at a dead
end.
</P>
<P>
   Domestically, Barak's promises to narrow the gap between rich
and poor have shown few results, and he is plagued by a campaign
financing scandal.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the Palestinian track. Barak has promised the
outline of a final agreement by the end of May, and a full fledged
agreement by Sept. 13. The sides are still deadlocked over final
borders, Jerusalem and the status of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Failure could mean a complete breakdown in negotiations and a
return to violence.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing a conference of developing countries in Havana on
Wednesday, Arafat said: ''Peace in the Middle East starts in
Palestine, just as war in the Middle East flares from Palestine.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian leader may also be expected to make concessions:
State Department spokesman James Rubin said the U.S. administration
expected next week's Clinton-Arafat meeting ''intensify this
process.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli official said that U.S. observers would begin
regularly attending the Israeli-Palestinian negotiating sessions at
Bolling Air Force Base near Washington. He said that Clinton felt
that their presence at the meetings would facilitate after-hours
informal mediation by U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   If the May deadline for a treaty framework approaches without
significant progress, the Americans would adopt a much more
involved role and begin to put formulations on the table, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said those ideas would ''bridge gaps'' and would not be
coercive.
</P>
<P>
   The three leaders -- Clinton, Arafat and Barak -- would wrap up
the loose ends at a Washington summit, the Israeli official said.
He didn't say when that would take place, but Barak is due to
attend a pro-Israel lobby on May 20 in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The official said that a successful treaty outline would ''make
it a lot easier for us to be more generous with territory'' in the
last interim troop withdrawal in the West Bank, slated for June.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians complain that Israel has so far refused to
withdraw from areas that would give them the contiguity they need
for statehood.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli official said that for Israel to consider the
outline agreement successful, it would have to address solutions
for Jewish settlements, borders and Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the two sides have exchanged drafts of a
final treaty outline this week.

<HEADLINE> Tax Payments Made in Different Ways  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For millions of last-minute taxpayers who
suddenly realize they owe money to Uncle Sam but don't have the
cash on hand, it could be time to whip out the credit cards or make
an installment payment deal with the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Accountants say there are ways to avoid such an unpleasant
surprise next year, and even people who get refunds should consider
changes to avoid giving the government use of their money for
months each year.
</P>
<P>
   This year's income tax filing deadline is midnight Monday,
except for much of New England and New York, where it's a day later
because a major IRS filing center located in Andover, Mass., will
be closed because of the local Patriot's Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
   As of last week, the Internal Revenue Service had received about
70 million of the 127 million individual returns expected this year
-- meaning millions of people, as usual, are waiting until the last
possible minute.
</P>
<P>
   Charging tax bills via credit is becoming an increasingly
popular choice. As of March 31, about 16,700 people had charged
payments averaging $1,362 this year by calling a toll-free number --
1-888-2PAYTAX-- and putting their taxes on their MasterCard,
American Express or Discover cards. Visa isn't taking part in the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, more than 53,000 federal tax payments were made with
credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're doing is adding an option for people to pay their
taxes and manage their resources on their own terms,'' said Bruce
Zanca, senior vice president at Official Payments Corp., a publicly
traded company contracted by the IRS to run the service.
</P>
<P>
   IRS officials hasten to add that they don't collect or keep
credit card numbers and do not collect any fees for use of credit
cards. An average fee of 2.5 percent is charged by Official
Payments, which keeps part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Another payment option is an installment agreement with the IRS,
which now will approve virtually any arrangement as long as the
amount owed is less than $25,000 and the bill can be paid within
five years.
</P>
<P>
   There is a one-time $43 fee for an installment deal, and the IRS
charges a late payment penalty that drops to a quarter-percent per
month as long as the tax return itself was filed on time. This
year's IRS installment interest rate is 9 percent, which might be
higher than a taxpayer could get by taking out a loan to pay off
the tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS has a calculator on its Internet web site that helps
taxpayers figure out their monthly payment amount, and they can
print out an installment agreement form to file with the agency.
</P>
<P>
   After the tax return is filed, financial advisers say it's smart
to see if changes would improve the picture next year. That
includes people who get big refunds, who are essentially giving the
government the use of their money interest-free for several months
each year -- money that could be invested, put in a savings account,
or used for a purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers should examine and adjust the amount of taxes that are
withheld from their paychecks if either their refund or payment was
too large.
</P>
<P>
   ''Keep your withholding down to a legal minimum,'' say advisers
at H&AMP;R Block, the nation's biggest tax preparation firm. ''The
point is for you to get the use and enjoyment of your money when
you earn it, rather than making an unintentional interest-free loan
to the government.''
</P>
<P>
   From the RIA Group consulting firm, here are some other tips on
reducing taxes next year:
</P>
<P>
   --If a balance was owed on the 1040 form, consider increasing tax
withholding and making estimated tax payments to avoid an
underpayment penalty. Most people can avoid that penalty by
ensuring that withholding or estimated payments equal the lesser of
90 percent of the 2000 tax bill or 100 percent of the 1999 tax
bill.
</P>
<P>
   --For a married couple filing jointly with adjusted gross income
over $150,000, estimated tax payments equal to the lesser of 108.6
percent of the 1999 tax or 90 percent of the 2000 tax must be made.	   --Married
couples who have a child in 2000 can count on a $2,800
dependency exemption, a $500 credit if gross income isn't above
$110,000 and possibly a child care credit of $480 or more.
</P>
<P>
   --Taxpayers can get a home equity loan for major purchases,
projects or other needs. Interest on up to $100,000 of home equity
debt is generally tax deductible, but interest on regular bank
loans or credit cards isn't.
</P>
<P>
   --People should increase contributions to 401(k) plans, IRAs or
other retirement plans that defer taxes.

<HEADLINE> Journalists Demonstrate in Iran  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Journalists protested Wednesday against the
jailing of a leading liberal newspaper's editor-in-chief on charges
of insulting Islam, while some 400 people demonstrated against the
annulment of reformists' election victories in their towns by a
hard-line body.
</P>
<P>
   An appeals court on Monday upheld the conviction of Mahmoud
Shams, editor-in-chief of the daily Asr-e-Azadegan, but reduced his
prison term by six months to 2{ years. Shams, who had been out on
bail during the appeal, immediately began serving the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Shams was a leading voice for press freedoms amid the power
struggle between reformists led by President Mohamad Khatami and
hard-liners in the ruling clergy in Iran's Islamic government.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the conservatives think they can solve their problems
through arresting and jailing journalists, we are ready to be taken
to jail so that their problem is resolved,'' leading reformist
writer, Abbass Abdi, said at a protest by 200 journalists in the
paper's offices in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   Shams, who is also known as Mashallah Shamsolvaezin, was tried
on charges of insulting religious sanctities in articles he
published last year in the now-banned Neshat daily.
</P>
<P>
   In Feburary elections, the reformists won control of the
parliament from hard-liners for the first time since the 1979
Islamic Revolution. Hard-liners, however, still control important
government bodies, including the Guardians Council, which must
approve all laws and has authority of elections.
</P>
<P>
   Residents from the towns of Khalkhal in northwest Iran and
Damavand in the suburbs of Tehran staged two separate protests
outside the Interior Ministry after the Guardians Council last week
canceled the election victories of Khatami allies in the towns.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying placards denouncing the council, some 200 residents of
Khalkhal gathered in the morning to protest the decision to cancel
the election of reformist Keikavous Khaknejad and award the seat to
Mottahar Kazemi, a hard-liner. The council said Khaknejad won
through intimidation and vote buying.
</P>
<P>
   In two earlier protests in Khalkhal itself, demonstrators hurled
stones at government buildings and public buses. At least 10 buses
were damaged and scores of windows were smashed.
</P>
<P>
   Another 200 residents of Damavand gathered in front of the
Interior Ministry in the afternoon, some of them shouting,
''Guardians Council, give back our votes.''
</P>
<P>
   The council canceled the results and ordered a revote in the
town without explanation.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urges Halt to Congo Fighting  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Two days before a new cease-fire agreement
takes effect in Congo, the U.N. Security Council urged the warring
parties Wednesday to stop fighting and start pulling back from
their front-line positions.
</P>
<P>
   Council members expressed their readiness to do everything
possible to speed up deployment of a 5,500-strong U.N. observer
mission charged with overseeing the disengagement. But U.N.
officials said that under the most optimistic scenario, it will
take another 2{ to 3{ months to deploy the troops.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Miyet, the undersecretary-general for peacekeeping, told
council members that the Congo government and its allies claim the
rebels and their backers, Rwanda and Uganda, are continuing to
violate last summer's original cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Security Council welcomed last Saturday's
agreement reached in Kampala, Uganda, by the warring parties to
stop fighting and pull back 10 miles from their front-line
positions by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. deputy ambassador Nancy Soderberg called the Kampala
meetings ''promising and encouraging'' and said they offered the
first hopeful sign in Congo in some time.
</P>
<P>
   Council members also discussed their upcoming visit to Congo and
neighboring countries which Canada's U.N. Ambassador Robert Fowler,
the current council president, said is aimed at reinforcing ''the
excellent news'' of the new cease-fire. No date has been set.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels took up arms in eastern Congo in Aug. 1998 to oust
Congolese President Laurent Kabila from power. Citing concerns
about security along their borders with Congo, Rwanda and Uganda
backed the rebels, while Kabila enlisted the support of Angola,
Zimbabwe and Namibia.
</P>
<P>
   The war has destabilized central Africa and last summer's
cease-fire has been violated by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   In late February, the Security Council authorized a 5,537-strong
U.N. mission -- including 500 military observers and four battalions
of security troops -- to verify that all parties observe the Congo
cease-fire. The council has also been pressing the warring parties
to stop fighting.
</P>
<P>
   With Saturday's adoption of a new plan to disengage the forces,
Miyet told the council that rapid deployment of the U.N. mission
''has acquired additional urgency,'' according to his prepared
remarks for the closed council meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged U.N. members Monday to
provide specialized troops so the force can deploy quickly. Miyet
on Wednesday told the council the U.N. troops cannot deploy ''in
conditions of adequate security'' without these units whose need
''is greater than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   These units are needed to prepare and maintain remote airstrips,
provide air traffic control, search and rescue operations, river
patrols, engineering projects, fuel and cargo handling, and medical
duties, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Miyet said he had invited a number of potential
troop-contributing countries to a meeting on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, U.N. officials said just 103 unarmed U.N.
military liaison officers are deployed in nine locations in Congo.
The United Nations only has commitments for two of the four
battalions -- from Pakistan and Senegal -- and Miyet said more
aircraft are needed to deploy troops and equipment throughout the
country because Congo has virtually no roads.
</P>
<P>
   With some 550,000 people displaced by the war, the council
reiterated its concern at the humanitarian situation. It also
appealed to donors to respond to the $73 million U.N. appeal for
Congo which so far has received only $1.2 million.

<HEADLINE> Urich Suing Castle Rock TV  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Robert Urich is suing Castle Rock Television
for nearly $1.5 million, claiming his TV series ''Lazarus Man'' was
canceled and he wasn't paid because he had cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Urich and his production company entered into an agreement with
Castle Rock in 1995 for Urich to act in the ''Lazarus Man'' pilot,
according to the suit filed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, he was to be paid $70,000 per episode for the
first season and $73,000 an episode the second season.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1996, Urich informed Castle Rock that he had cancer and
would have to undergo treatment, but the suit said at no time was
Urich unable to perform under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Castle Rock terminated the agreement a month later, the suit
said.
</P>
<P>
   Urich's breach of contract suit, filed in Superior Court, seeks
$1.47 million, the amount he would have received for the second
season of ''Lazarus Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Castle Rock said in a statement that the company did not
understand the basis for the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ''We worked very closely with him and only with great reluctance
concluded that we were unable to continue to produce the series
without its star,'' Castle Rock said.
</P>
<P>
   Urich underwent chemotherapy, radiation treatments and two
operations in the mid-1990s to successfully fight synovial cell
sarcoma, a rare cancer that attacks the joints.

<HEADLINE> Ford, Texas DMV Battle For Web Site  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE MABIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN (AP) -- Opening statements began Wednesday in a dispute
that could change the way cars are sold over the Internet in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co. is asking an administrative law judge to allow
the automaker to reopen a used-car Web site shut down by the state
for violating franchise laws, arguing that officials are curtailing
e-commerce opportunities in the nation's second largest market.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Division of Motor Vehicles officials say, however, that
the law that clearly prohibits the direct selling of automobiles
online by Ford or anyone else without a license.
</P>
<P>
   ''When this Internet purpose is to sell used cars directly to
the public, it's a violation of state law,'' said Phillip Layer, an
attorney representing the state. ''It's very clear and simple,'' he
said in his statement.
</P>
<P>
   Only dealers licensed by the state can sell cars here; brokering
-- arranging a transaction for a fee -- is illegal, officials said.
Licensed dealers can sell cars online.
</P>
<P>
   Ford attorney Kenneth Valka countered that Ford followed Texas
laws that he said are ''difficult, non-defined and in fact, in this
particular case, non-applicable.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Ford is not selling cars over the Internet, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The true fact is that Ford is advertising its pre-owned
vehicles, not selling its pre-owned vehicles,'' Valka said. ''You
will not find one contract to buy a car between Ford and a
customer. Every contract is between the dealer and the customer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ford fight began in November 1999, when the division sent
Houston Ford and Lincoln Mercury dealers a letter informing them
that they could be fined up to $10,000 a day per violation for
participating in Ford's Pre-Owned Showroom program, which allows
consumers to search for certified used vehicles via a Web site.
Prices are preset by dealers and cannot be negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Ford says the actual sale is made by a dealer after customers
choose a vehicle, pay a deposit online and are referred to a local
dealership.
</P>
<P>
   The state contends that Ford -- not a licensed dealer -- is
selling cars directly, thus violating the franchise law.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just want the site to get up and running again,'' Mecke
said, adding that the company would like to expand the site
statewide. The program has been successful in parts of California,
Georgia, Alabama, New York and New Jersey, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from Ford and some Internet companies say it's a
case of Texas interfering with the growth of e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems as if the (Texas Division of Motor Vehicles) is so
preoccupied with constraining auto manufacturers that they've
missed the point that this it is good for the consumers, it's good
for the dealer, it's great for Ford Motor Co.,'' said John H.
Mecke, director of legislative franchise affairs for Ford.
</P>
<P>
   The state also stymied General Motors Corp.'s plans to sell cars
in Texas over the Internet by denying the automotive giant a
dealer's license.
</P>
<P>
   Several dot-coms, which do not have licenses, also have been
prevented from selling online in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Kent, the lead enforcement officer for the Texas Division
of Motor Vehicles testified Wednesday that officials are only doing
their jobs of enforcing the law.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that it's on the Internet, as far as we're concerned,
is irrelevant. It's the activity that we are not condoning,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kent was the only witness to testify during the 9{ hour hearing,
which was scheduled to resume Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts estimate that 750,000 vehicles worth about $19 billion
will be bought online this year, doubling online sales although
representing a small portion of the $350 billion nationwide new-car
business.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen other states have similar laws, but many Internet
dealers have expressed frustration over being locked out of the
Texas market, the nation's second-largest estimated at upward of
$30 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   State officials have said the anti-broker law keeps
price-inflating middlemen out of the car business.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers say the laws are fair because they've invested millions
of dollars in their facilities and inventories.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's hearing is the first of as many as five hearings
that may be heard by the Texas DMV before a decision is made -- a
process that could take up to six months, said Gaby Garcia, a
spokeswoman from the Texas Department of Transportation, which
oversees the Texas DMV.

<HEADLINE> Kennedy Apologizes for Airport Spat  </HEADLINE>
By CAREN BENJAMIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Patrick Kennedy urged the Los Angeles
police Wednesday to release a surveillance video of a confrontation
between him and a security guard who claims he shoved and grabbed
her.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said, ''I lost my temper,'' during the incident last
month at Los Angeles International Airport. But he said he
apologized quickly to the guard, Della Patton, 58, and never hurt
her as she claims. His lawyer said the video would clear him.
</P>
<P>
   ''The entire episode has been blown completely out of
proportion,'' Kennedy, D-R.I., said in a speech at a dinner for
Rhode Island business and government leaders. ''I could have acted
a lot better than I did, but I did not do any of the horrible
things that have been reported.''
</P>
<P>
   Police have said the video shows ''physical contact'' between
Patton and Kennedy. Police also have said the video is evidence in
a criminal investigation and would not be released.
</P>
<P>
   No charges have been filed against Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, who served as chief investigative
counsel for House Democrats in President Clinton's impeachment
proceedings, wrote Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks
requesting the video be made public.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am extremely hopeful that the release of the video and the
prompt confirmation that this episode merits no action by the
police or city attorney end this matter and allow both Ms. Patton
and Congressman Kennedy to get back to their normal lives,'' Lowell
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell, for the first time, also outlined Kennedy's view of the
March 26 scuffle.
</P>
<P>
   Patton had said Kennedy hurt her after she told him his bag was
too big to fit through an X-ray scanner. Lowell denied the claim.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ms. Patton came through the metal detector to confront the
congressman, and he did not go after her in any way,'' Lowell
wrote. ''The congressman never grabbed or twisted or pulled Ms.
Patton's arm or shoved her down or caused her excruciating pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy left the security area to check his bag, then returned
and saw Patton there, Lowell wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ms. Patton stayed on her job with no apparent injury after the
congressman departed and even was able to show her co-workers what
happened without any apparent restrictions of movement or pain,''
Lowell wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Patton said the congressman, son of Sen. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass., grabbed her arm and cursed at her while ordering her out
of the way. She complained of injuries to her left shoulder and
filed a battery complaint with police on or about April 1.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's chief of staff, Tony Marcella, said Patton's attorney,
Paul Trump, has approached them hoping for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Trump said he contacted Lowell, simply to ''open a line of
communication,'' but he would not comment on their discussion.

<HEADLINE> Lott Denies Pastrana on Aid Plan  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE PFLEGER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Colombian President Andres Pastrana failed to
persuade Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott on Wednesday to speed up
passage of an aid package for his country's fight against drugs.
</P>
<P>
   After a morning meeting with Pastrana, Lott said he was eager to
include the aid as part of the normal appropriations process,
hopefully within the next three months, but not as emergency
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The House already has approved $1.7 billion to aid Colombia and
other countries in the region in fighting illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the legislative process and in government, you cannot give
any absolutes,'' Lott said. ''But I feel very strongly that it will
be completed in May or early June.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott said the legislation will call for awarding the aid as soon
as President Clinton signs the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana is asking the United States and European countries to
contribute $3.5 billion to a $7.5 billion plan to fight drug
trafficking in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke with Pastrana by telephone from Air Force One for
about 10 minutes while flying back to Washington from Denver, where
he attended a gun-control rally.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president wanted to talk with President Pastrana at the
conclusion of his visit to Washington,'' Lockhart said. He said
Clinton wanted an update on Pastrana's meetings with Congress and
their joint effort to pass an aid package for Colombia. Lockhart
said Pastrana characterized the visit as ''constructive'' and both
Pastrana and Clinton were optimistic about the state of the aid
package in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The House supplemental spending bill included money for military
equipment, training and other aid for Colombia's battle against
drug producers and their rebel allies. It also included funds for
U.S. military operations in Kosovo and for domestic hurricane
relief. Lott objected to other funds added to the original bill in
the House.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana also was meeting with House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., as well as the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a luncheon with the American Society of Newspaper
Editors, Pastrana, a former member of the media, said Colombia is
often misunderstood by foreign countries and the foreign press.
</P>
<P>
   ''The choices and the crises are, in my view, often misreported
and misunderstood,'' he said. ''When you see your country's name
continually misspelled, even in the most distinguished newspapers,
you naturally worry about the rest of the reporting.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics often have complained that the aid package would
entangle the United States in a Colombian civil war. But Pastrana
said Colombia is not in the midst of one.
</P>
<P>
   ''A civil war occurs in a divided nation, torn apart into armed
camps of more or less the same size,'' he said. ''Even though
billions of dollars generated by drug-trafficking sustain the
violence, the guerillas cannot overthrow our democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that his country will not become another Vietnam, where
American troops are dispatched to fight another country's war.
</P>
<P>
   ''Neither your public opinion nor ours would support or permit
such a move,'' Pastrana said. ''And neither your government nor
ours has considered this in even the most extreme circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana was elected in 1998. After taking office, he met with
Clinton to ask for assistance. The administration has requested 63
helicopters, training, intelligence assistance and other aid to the
country's military and judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   ''A Colombia at peace ... means not only less violence on our
streets, but less drug-trafficking on yours,'' Pastrana said.

<HEADLINE> Recorder From Marine Osprey Found  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARANA, Ariz. (AP) -- Investigators recovered the flight data
recorder from the charred wreckage of an Osprey military aircraft
that crashed during a training exercise, killing 19 Marines,
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The recorder, discovered Tuesday, will be taken to the
manufacturer, Smith Industries in Grand Rapids, Mich., where
officials from the Naval Safety Center will translate and analyze
the data. The Pentagon said it wasn't sure how long the process
will take.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they're optimistic that because of the presence of an
aircraft flight data recorder, we may actually be further ahead
than we would be in a military accident,'' said Maj. Patrick G.
Gibbons, a Marine Corps spokesman in Washington. ''Most military
aircraft do not carry such a device.''
</P>
<P>
   Maj. David Andersen, a Pentagon spokesman at the crash site near
a rural, Arizona airport, said the recorder should contain
information on what was on the pilot's gauges and instrument panel,
such as speed and oil pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen said nothing has been ruled out a possible cause of
Saturday's crash.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery team Wednesday retrieved the last body left in the
wreckage. The other 18 were recovered Tuesday. All of the bodies
were to be flown to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware for
identification before they are turned over to the families.
</P>
<P>
   The wreckage was being loaded onto pallets to be shipped on
three flatbed trucks by Friday to the Marine Corps Air Station in
Yuma, where the flight originated. The wreckage will undergo
further detailed inspection there.

<HEADLINE> Breast-Implant Suit Arguements Heard  </HEADLINE>
By JIM SUHR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- A Dow Corning Corp. attorney asked a federal
judge Wednesday to set aside a bankruptcy court's opinion the
company says modifies and jeopardizes a $3.2 billion settlement
over silicone breast implants.
</P>
<P>
   George Tarpley asked U.S. District Judge Denise Page Hood to
vacate federal Bankruptcy Judge Arthur Spector's December opinion
that women opposed to the settlement may sue Dow Corning's parent
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Tarpley called Spector's opinion ''an error of law'' that, if
allowed to stand, could cripple the settlement that took years to
reach and has been approved by 94 percent of the 112,774 women who
last year voted on it.
</P>
<P>
   The companies and lawyers for women who voted in favor of the
settlement say Spector's opinion changed the terms of the
settlement he approved Nov. 30. That invalidated the deal, which
was part of Dow Corning's $4.5 billion plan to emerge from Chapter
11 bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Tarpley told Hood that Dow Corning -- a 50-50 joint venture
between Dow Chemical Co. and Corning Inc. -- was prepared to begin
paying claimants, if Spector's opinion is reversed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It serves no purpose whatsoever to pay out $3 billion over a
number of years only to have this litigation continue in other
forms, as it did before bankruptcy,'' Tarpley said. ''We want to
shut down litigation. If we're gonna pay money for it, we want it
over with.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, Dow Corning would pay out $3.2 billion to
settle claims by more than 170,000 women blaming various health
problems on silicone implants once made by the company.
</P>
<P>
   But in his Dec. 21 opinion, Spector said women who voted against
the settlement still could sue Dow Chemical and Corning if they
chose. Spector said he lacked the power to release the parent
companies from future liability, and the settlement wasn't designed
to grant such a release anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Chemical spokesman John Musser has said that if Spector's
opinion stands, ''then the plan won't be confirmed.''
</P>
<P>
   The no-lawsuit release in the settlement had been fought by
lawyers for a group of women from Nevada, where that state's
Supreme Court has upheld damages against Dow Chemical over silicone
implants, opening the door for similar lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   John White, one of the attorneys representing the 47 Nevada
women, told Hood ''there's no reason, no bankruptcy purpose, for
any injunction or stay against suing Dow Chemical over implants.''
</P>
<P>
   Spector handles proceedings stemming from Dow Corning's
bankruptcy filing, while Hood handles the case's appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing is to continue Thursday, with arguments scheduled
over classifications and treatment of foreign claims, among other
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys expect Hood's ruling to take weeks. Any ruling
unfavorable to parties in the case could be appealed to the 6th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati.

<HEADLINE> Ex Calif. Official Indicted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The former head of a California state finance
commission has been charged with evading $79,000 in federal income
taxes, prosecutors said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Greer Lyle concealed her income in foreign bank accounts
and ensured no W-2s were prepared in her name for three years while
serving as vice president and assistant treasurer of a Miami
development company, the indictment charged.
</P>
<P>
   Lyle, who served as executive director of the California
Commission of State Finance in the early 1990s, made an initial
court appearance Wednesday in Washington, waived removal to Miami,
surrendered her passport and was freed on $250,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
   The commission provided opinions on revenue projections to the
state treasurer's office until it lost its funding in 1993 in a
dispute between then-Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, and Democratic
Treasurer Kathleen Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The three-count indictment covered unreported income from 1993
to 1995. If convicted, Lyle could face up to 15 years in prison and
a $300,000 fine.

<HEADLINE> U.N., Cambodia To Resolve Deadlock  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Cambodian and U.N. diplomats plan to meet soon in
an effort to end a deadlock over the prosecution of former Khmer
Rouge leaders on genocide charges, the United Nations announced
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Cambodian Prime Minister
Hun Sen met Wednesday in Havana, where both were attending a Third
World summit, to discuss issues blocking an unprecedented
U.N.-backed tribunal judging crimes against humanity in a Cambodian
court.
</P>
<P>
   Cambodia and the United Nations have bickered for more than a
year over which side should control trials of Khmer Rouge leaders
accused of causing the deaths of an estimated 1.7 million
Cambodians during their brutal reign in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   While they have tentatively agreed to a jointly administered
tribunal, Cambodia has rejected U.N. demands for a foreign
prosecutor with powers to issue independent indictments.
</P>
<P>
   Cambodia wants indictments to be handled by co-prosecutors -- one
Cambodian, one foreign -- fearing that a foreign prosecutor may try
to bring too many ex-Khmer Rouge to trial and upset the country's
newfound peace.

   The Khmer Rouge waged a civil war after being driven from power
by a Vietnamese invasion in 1979 and the last holdouts surrendered
two years ago. Many are believed to have secured promises from the
current government that they would not be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Cambodian Foreign Minister Hor Namhong said this week that
Cambodia and the United Nations agree on joint indictments, but
there had been no consensus on how to resolve disagreements between
the two prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Annan and Hun Sen ''are seeking a compromise formula,'' the U.N.
statement said. ''The two working groups will have to meet one more
time and the expectation is that this will happen in the shortest
amount of time.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials said it hadn't been decided when or whether the
meeting would occur in New York or Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
   When U.N. negotiators last left Cambodia, there was no
indication they would have to get back together before a decision
was made.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen told diplomats last week that one possible solution was
to have the court's panel of judges settle any prosecutorial
squabbles, but some legal experts have balked at involving judges
in indictments.
</P>
<P>
   The radical communist Khmer Rouge have evaded justice for nearly
25 years since they seized power and forced Cambodia's entire
population into crude farming collectives. Overwork, starvation,
disease and mass executions claimed nearly one in four lives.

<HEADLINE> Reno in Miami for Elian Talks  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX VEIGA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno took an
extraordinary step to resolve the Elian Gonzalez case Wednesday,
flying to Miami and personally urging his relatives to end the
wrenching 4{-month custody struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Reno left after a 2{-hour meeting with the boy's great-uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez, and cousin, Marisleysis Gonzalez, at the Miami
Beach home of Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, the nun who was host of a
January meeting between Elian and his grandmothers from Cuba. It
was unclear whether Reno met with the 6-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate word whether a handover agreement was
reached.
</P>
<P>
   ''She wants to do anything possible to resolve this,'' Justice
Department spokesman Myron Marlin said before the meeting. ''She
realizes it's a tall order but believes she may be the one who can
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian and his relatives had left their politically charged
Little Havana neighborhood for Sister O'Laughlin's gated home
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   One option Reno planned to propose was for Elian and some of his
Miami relatives to come back to Washington, perhaps even on her
plane, to arrange a meeting with the boy's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, and the eventual transfer of custody, according to a
government official, who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   This official said the attorney general's negotiation strategy
was flexible and she did not intend to insist upon any single plan.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Gutierrez, a spokesman for the Miami relatives, called
her trip ''a good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   The visit at least temporarily postponed a letter the government
had planned to send the Miami relatives Wednesday telling them
where and when to relinquish custody of Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ''The timing of the letter is now in Reno's hands,'' Marlin
said.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department official, requesting anonymity, explained
that if Reno and the family could agree on plans to transfer the
boy, the letter wouldn't be necessary. But if the talks failed, it
was possible that Reno would hand the relatives the letter.
</P>
<P>
   It was learned that the latest draft of the letter called for
the transfer to occur at 9 a.m. Thursday at Opa-locka airport
outside Miami. The transfer could also be moved back to Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the government plan, Elian would be transferred either to
his father or another great-uncle, who would take the boy to meet
his father.
</P>
<P>
   Reno also planned to meet with community leaders in her
hometown, where she served as state's attorney for 15 years and
where Cuban exiles now wield signs denouncing her and depicting her
with horns.
</P>
<P>
   Elian, clinging to an inner tube, was rescued by two fishermen
on Thanksgiving after his mother and 10 other Cubans drowned when
their boat sank.
</P>
<P>
   His Miami relatives have been caring for him ever since and have
been fighting in court for him to have an asylum hearing. But the
Clinton administration has ordered Elian back to his father in
Cuba, saying only he can speak for the boy on immigration matters.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge affirmed that decision, but the family has
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father, who met with Reno after coming to America last
week, remained in Bethesda, Md. He indicated Wednesday -- the day
after a meeting in Washington with the Miami relatives was
scheduled and abruptly canceled -- that he was through negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is going to simply ask now that the attorney general issue
a court order and that the boy be returned immediately to him,''
said the Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, who met with him.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, his wife and their infant son were
guests of honor at a reception at the Cuban diplomatic mission in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In Havana, Ricardo Alarcon, the senior Cuban official who has
advised the father, criticized the Miami relatives for delaying the
transfer, saying they were showing ''a total lack of respect for
American society,'' and ''making fun of the U.S. government.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister O'Laughlin, speaking outside her home before Reno's
arrival, said Elian would stay there overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have hopefully a chance to do some good healing in the
family,'' Sister O'Laughlin said. ''It is my hope and prayer that
as the child becomes reacquainted with his father, that there will
be peace in the family.''
</P>
<P>
   When she first got involved, Sister O'Laughlin said she had no
opinion about whether the boy should be returned. But after the
grandmothers' visit, she said Elian should stay in the United
States -- drawing bitter criticism from the Cuban government and the
grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
   If Elian's relatives were hoping for a quieter setting in Miami
Beach, they only partially succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   While Reno met with the family, dozens of police and federal
agents kept watch over about 100 demonstrators. Several waved a
Cuban flag bigger than a king-sized bedsheet.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Elian arrived at the house, a crowd chanted ''Elian!
Elian!'' in anticipation. About 25 Miami Beach police cars arrived
less than an hour later. Two police boats patrolled a nearby
salt-water canal.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators were forced to keep a greater distance than on
Lazaro Gonzalez's narrow street. Police kept them across a
four-lane road, behind a median and a barricade.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reno, coward, Miami has had enough!'' some shouted.
</P>
<P>
   At Lazaro Gonzalez's house, protesters were starting to
acknowledge that Elian may be heading back to Cuba. But the
attorney general's visit to Miami gave some a ray of hope.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now she's not the Cuban-Americans' best friend, but that
could change between today and tomorrow,'' said Rolando Millet, 39.
He held a sign: ''America get ready for a miracle.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks fell early Thursday as overnight drops
on Wall Street dragged down Japanese high-technology issues. The
U.S. dollar was higher against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 226.95 points,
or 1.09 percent, to 20,606.26 in the first 30 minutes of trading.
On Wednesday, the average closed up 310.69 points, or 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 105.84 yen, up 0.36 yen from late Wednesday in
Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 105.80 yen
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, prices started lower following another
sharp fall in U.S. high-technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Among early losers were high-technology blue chips, including
Sony, TDK, NEC and Fujitsu.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Nasdaq composite index closed at 3,769.63 on
Wednesday, down 286.27 points, its second worst point drop and its
first close below 4,000 since Jan. 31. The Dow Jones industrial
average fell 161.95 points to 11,125.13 at Wednesday's close.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 25.01 points, or 1.47 percent, to 1,681.33.
The TOPIX closed up 5.25 points, or 0.31 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar edged higher against the yen in
early Tokyo trading as some investors bought back dollars sold
Wednesday after Bank of Japan Governor Masaru Hayami suggested the
central bank's near 'zero' interest rate policy may be changed. He
did not specify when that would happen.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates tend to make a nation's currency more
attractive to investors.
</P>
<P>
   Still, dealers said they were expecting narrow range-trading
ahead of a weekend meeting of finance officials from major
industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
   Finance ministers and central bankers from the G-7 -- Britain,
France, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States and Japan -- will
gather in Washington to discuss global economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 101.51 yen, up from
100.97 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose
to 1.8350 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.7800 percent. Its
price fell 0.45 point to 100.55.

   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- South Carolina state senators today endorsed a bill to
remove the Confederate flag from atop the Statehouse dome. Opponents say the

behind an existing monument honoring Confederate soldiers on Statehouse grounds.
The flag would fly on the north side of the Statehouse from a pole no taller
than 20 feet. That element was added to satisfy black lawmakers and other flag
opponents who did not want the flag in a prominent position to passers-by.

spokesman Jim Nolan said today. The insurance giant, which has policyholders in
nearly every state, is eliminating the cap after learning more about medical

instituted in the late-1980s when little was known about the ailment or the

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Farmers Said Intimidated  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- White farm owners whose property has
been occupied by black squatters accused ruling party supporters on
Wednesday of targeting farm workers in a fresh wave of
intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling party of President Robert Mugabe has supported the
farm occupations, but many black farm workers have defended the
farm owners' property. This weekend, ruling party supporters held
what they called ''re-education'' meetings in farm workers' homes,
using force to try to change their loyalties, the farmers'
spokesman Malcolm Vowles said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a pattern of intimidation and witch-hunting in the
compounds at night. We have information on three cases of serious
assaults on workers, using sticks and fists,'' said Vowles, a
spokesman for the Commercial Farmers Union that represents many of
the white farmers. Those attacks occurred in the Bindura area, a
tobacco and corn district 50 miles northeast of Harare, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Nearby Murewa, squatters on Wednesday seized and burned
T-shirts with symbols of the Movement for Democratic Change, the
main opposition group. The squatters said white farmers backed the
opposition group, witnesses said. The union also reported that
squatters backed by the ruling party smashed several private
vehicles and a tractor on a farm southwest of Harare on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the union reported more than 50 cases of violence
against farmers and workers.
</P>
<P>
   Squatters led by armed men claiming to be veterans of Zimbabwe's
independence war have illegally occupied and staked claims to more
than 900 white-owned farms.
</P>
<P>
   With opposition mounting to his two decades of rule, Mugabe has
backed the illegal occupations, arguing they are a justified
protest against unfair land ownership. About 4,000 white farmers
own one-third of Zimbabwe's productive land, while most blacks
remain landless and impoverished.
</P>
<P>
   At the Group of 77 summit in Cuba, Mugabe blamed Britain for
reneging on promises of funding for land reform.
</P>
<P>
   The problem ''worsened only because the Labor government has not
wanted to follow in the footsteps of the Conservative government,''
Mugabe said Wednesday, asserting that the previous British
government had been moving toward assistance on the land issue.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, the government said it has canceled a planned
independence anniversary celebration featuring military parades,
tribal dancing and sports displays to save money.
</P>
<P>
   April 18 is the 20th anniversary of independence from white
rule. But it comes as Zimbabwe faces its worst economic crisis and
the violent farm occupations continue unchecked by police.
</P>
<P>
   Munyaradzi Hwengwere, a spokesman in Mugabe's office, said this
year's celebrations would be replaced by a nationwide television
broadcast featuring Mugabe. He said the money would be diverted to
help victims of recent floods in southern and eastern Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to the more needy sections of our society,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Germany, Russia to Swap WWII Art  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Germany and Russia will exchange art looted by
Nazi and Soviet troops during World War II, including pieces from a
Russian czarist palace's legendary Amber Room, officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   However, the swap, scheduled for later this month, is only a
small step forward in resolving disputes over ''trophy art'' that
weigh on relations between the two former enemies even after the
end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Germany still wants Russia to return more than 1 million books,
paintings, coins and other items such as church windows that have
languished in museum basements for more than half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has generally viewed the captured art as compensation for
the Nazis' wartime devastation. The Amber Room, named after its
wall panels of golden-brown amber, has been high on the list of art
Russia wants back.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting in Moscow on April 28, German officials are to
return a mosaic and a chest of drawers that once were in the Amber
Room.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the city of Bremen -- where the mosaic was
discovered -- will get back 101 graphics and watercolors, including
art by Albrecht Duerer, Manet, Goya and Toulouse-Lautrec. The
works, valued in the millions, disappeared from a Bremen museum in
1945.
</P>
<P>
   The Amber Room mosaic was found to be in the possession of a
Bremen man in 1997. After a court ordered him to hand it over to
the city, a local businessman concerned about Germany's image
reportedly paid the man's heirs $100,000 not to sue to reclaim the
art.
</P>
<P>
   The chest of drawers was turned over to the German government by
a woman in Leipzig who recognized it in a 1996 TV report. She said
she bought it in the 1950s from a state antique agency in what was
then communist East Germany -- a Soviet ally.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,300-square foot Amber Room was a gift from Prussian King
Frederick William to Peter the Great in the early 18th century. It
was installed in a palace the czar built for his wife, Catherine I,
outside St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Retreating Nazi troops looted the palace in World War II and the
Amber Room was moved to a castle in Koenigsberg, now the Russian
city of Kaliningrad. It disappeared from there in 1945 and most of
the amber panels have never resurfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Both Nazi and Soviet troops systematically stripped valuables
and shipped them home during World War II. The looted art has been
a regular irritant in German-Russian relations over the last
decade, at times leading to top-level diplomacy by former leaders
Helmut Kohl and Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most controversial items is the Trojan gold that the
Red Army carried from Berlin to Moscow at the end of the war. The
German government has demanded the return of the gold, which Moscow
long denied having, but then put on display in a museum in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The treasure was excavated by German archaeologist Heinrich
Schliemann in 1873, who believed that it once belonged to the king
of the ancient city of Troy.

   DETROIT (AP) -- A Dow Corning Corp. attorney asked a federal judge today to
set aside a bankruptcy court's opinion the company says modifies and jeopardizes
a $3.2 billion settlement over silicone breast implants. George Tarpley asked
U.S. District Judge Denise Page Hood to vacate federal Bankruptcy Judge Arthur
Spector's December opinion that women opposed to the settlement may sue Dow
Corning's parent companies. Tarpley called Spector's opinion ''an error of law''
that, if allowed to stand, could cripple the settlement that took years to reach
and has been approved by 94 percent of the 112,774 women who last year voted on
it.

   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Mutual of Omaha is eliminating its medical coverage cap
for policyholders infected with HIV or AIDS. Such clients will receive the same
medical coverage as those with other ailments, effective May 1, company
spokesman Jim Nolan said today. The insurance giant, which has policyholders in
nearly every state, is eliminating the cap after learning more about medical
coverage of AIDS-related problems, Nolan said. AIDS insurance caps were
instituted in the late-1980s when little was known about the ailment or the
insurance risks, Nolan said.

<HEADLINE> War Criminal Gets Russia Citizenship  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday granted
Russian citizenship to Vasily Kononov, a Latvian convicted this
year of war crimes as a World War II Soviet partisan, the
presidential press service announced.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's move was not likely to have direct legal effect on the
case but underlined Russia's protest over the conviction. The
Kremlin has called the conviction discrimination against an ethnic
Russian.
</P>
<P>
   Kononov, 77, is serving a six-year sentence for ordering the
execution of nine civilians, some of whom were burned alive, when
he was a Soviet partisan fighting the Nazis who occupied Latvia in
1941-44.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, officials protested Latvia's refusal to allow
Russian doctors to examine Kononov, saying the Baltic country's
hard line in the case ''proves the complete disregard of Latvian
powers to acknowledge universal humanitarian principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia and Latvia have been at odds since the 1991 collapse of
the Soviet Union over Latvia's treatment of its large ethnic
Russian community and over Latvia's prosecution of fighters on the
Soviet side.

<HEADLINE> S. Koreans Vote for New Parliament  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Koreans voted Thursday for a new
parliament in an election that could affect the two trademark
policies of President Kim Dae-jung: economic reforms and engagement
with North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Three days before the election, Kim weighed in with the dramatic
announcement of a first-ever summit with the country's bitter
enemy, North Korea. Still, many analysts said it was unclear how
that would effect the tight race.
</P>
<P>
   In balmy spring weather, voters stood in long lines at polling
stations in the capital of Seoul and surrounding areas on Thursday.
Radio and television stations repeatedly broadcast instructions
urging people to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours after the polls opened, election officials said
about 11 percent of eligible voters had cast ballots, a slight drop
from the turnout reported at the same point in the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   Polls were scheduled to close at 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   At a school auditorium near his residence in Seoul, President
Kim cast his ballot, taking the opportunity to urge others to do
the same.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything depends on voters. If anything is wrong, voters can
correct it by voting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite forest fires that prompted the evacuation of thousands
of people from their homes in an eastern coastal region, the voting
in the area went off without interruption, reported Yonhap, the
national news agency.
</P>
<P>
   With up to 40 percent of votes still undecided, Kim's ruling
party was running neck-and-neck with the main opposition Grand
National Party.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement of the June 12-14 summit with North Korea
brought opposition criticism of the timing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The South-North summit, announced only three days before the
election, is a despicable political conspiracy,'' said Lee
Hoi-chang, head of the opposition party, which is the largest party
in the outgoing parliament with 129 seats.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling Millennium Democratic Party, with 103 seats in the
outgoing parliament, is unlikely to emerge from voting with an
absolute majority, analysts say. That would force it to find a
coalition partner.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 1,040 candidates are vying for 227 seats to be filled
by direct vote. Another 46 members will be chosen by proportional
representation system, which counts the total number of votes to
each party.
</P>
<P>
   All four major parties of South Korea depend on regional
support, so policies have less influence on voting.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, two years into his five-year term, is seeking a mandate for
his economic reforms and engagement with the North's communist
government.
</P>
<P>
   The summit has considerably muzzled opposition criticism that
his ''sunshine'' policy has failed to produce concessions from the
North.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some voters remained skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the summit is only a show for elections. And whatever
outcome the summit would have, it would take a long time for us to
see,'' said Kim Jong-tae, 46, an architect. ''I don't think it
would affect voters at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The summit could bring the ruling party votes from those with
relatives in North Korea who hope it will bring progress on
resuming family reunifications, halted since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of North Koreans immigrated to South Korea after the
1945 division of the Korean peninsula and during the 1950-53 Korean
War, and most have lost touch with their families in the North.
</P>
<P>
   Kim has said family reunions will be top on the agenda of his
summit talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, to be held in
the North's capital, Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean border, the world's most heavily armed, and there is
no mail or other direct means of communications between them.
</P>
<P>
   Reforms of South Korea's inefficient economic system, especially
its family-owned conglomerates, or chaebol, is another pressing
issue for Kim's government.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen of the conglomerates collapsed under mounds of
debts in 1997, forcing South Korea to accept a record $58 billion
bailout package from the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ''The two issues are matters of grave concern to international
policymakers and pundits,'' said Kim Kyong-won, a political and
diplomatic analyst.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Backs Colo. Gun Measure  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- President Clinton threw his support behind a
ballot initiative for new restrictions on firearms sales at gun
shows Wednesday. But the state's Republican governor boycotted
Clinton's appearance even though he agrees with the president on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Some Columbine parents also were resentful of the visit, which
came one week before the anniversary of the high school massacre.
They feared the tragedy was being politicized.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton came here to express support for a state ballot measure
seeking to close a loophole that allows guns to be purchased at gun
shows without a background check. The lack of a background check
allowed a friend to buy weapons for the two teen-age Columbine
killers, who were among the 15 dead.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation on the matter failed in the Colorado Legislature
this year. Sane Alternatives to the Firearms Epidemic, a group
organized after Columbine, has launched a petition campaign to put
the issue on the ballot this November.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is just as much support for this idea among Republicans
as there is among Democrats,'' said John Head, a Republican who is
co-president of SAFE. ''When the name-calling stops ... I have no
doubt the voters of Colorado will approve this measure.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The country is looking very closely at Colorado,'' Clinton
told a rally staged by SAFE. ''We know it's a state with a broken
heart over Columbine. We know it's a state where people can put
aside their partisan differences, and maybe even their lifetime
culture, to look at the facts. Other states will follow your lead.
I hope and pray Congress will follow your lead as well.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's visit prompted some dismay in the Columbine
community.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's been enough trauma in my town already. I think he
ought to go home,'' said Steve Cordova, a gun-rights activist whose
daughter escaped unhurt from the school.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Clinton participated in a town hall meeting televised
nationally on MSNBC. Almost immediately, state legislator Doug Dean
told him closing the loophole would not have stopped the Columbine
tragedy because the purchaser would have passed a background check.
</P>
<P>
   ''So it really wouldn't have had any impact,'' Dean said. ''Our
legislative responsibility is to pass legislation that actually
will go to the root of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Replied Clinton: ''You can't refuse to vote for a law because
it's not perfect and it won't solve every problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has regularly cited the Columbine killings as he makes
his argument for ''commonsense gun laws'' in response to a wave of
deadly hootings.
</P>
<P>
   Although Republican Gov. Bill Owens supports the ballot
initiative, he stayed away from Wednesday's events, saying he was
leery of the political overtones.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do hope that he doesn't politicize a Colorado issue and get
involved in something that ought to be up to Coloradans to vote and
agree on,'' Owens said of Clinton on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Columbine High School's principal, Frank DeAngelis, came to
Clinton's defense, saying the president has been ''actively
involved with Columbine'' since last year's shooting.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Republican National Committee Chairman Jim
Nicholson accused Clinton of politicking. ''Bill Clinton and Al
Gore have spent the last seven years campaigning on the backs of
national tragedies,'' Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took to the road Wednesday in hopes of turning up
pressure on Congress to take up gun safety legislation. A
House-Senate conference committee has been assigned to reconcile
differences between a Senate-passed bill that would set a 72-hour
background check on gun-show sales and a House bill that shrank the
wait to 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The committee has met only once, in August, which the White
House attributes to political maneuvering by the National Rifle
Association.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton spoke in Denver, House Judiciary Chairman Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., and the committee's senior Democrat, Rep. John
Conyers of Michigan, asked Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah, to schedule a meeting as soon as possible to discuss the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde also floated a concession on the key issue of waiting
periods for gun show purchases. In a letter Wednesday, Hyde said a
majority of House Republicans involved in negotiating gun safety
legislation with the Senate supported a compromise closer to the
president's position.
</P>
<P>
   In line with Clinton's thinking, Hyde said, background check
waiting periods would apply both to would-be gun purchasers with
unresolved arrest records and those with red flags for other
offenses such as drug use, mental incapacity, domestic violence or
stalking.
</P>
<P>
   Conyers discounted Hyde's offer, saying it was ''further
capitulation by the Republican leadership to the NRA's political
gamesmanship.'' He said it contained fatal loopholes that exempted
people indicted for crimes from longer waiting periods and allowed
''bad apple'' gun dealers to avoid federal scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, 16 Republican moderates wrote to Clinton and GOP
leaders urging quick action on the juvenile crime bill that
contains provisions on gun-show background checks, trigger locks
and other measures.
</P>
<P>
   ''A failure to pass the limited, commonsense reforms now under
consideration is simply unacceptable to most Americans,'' wrote
Rep. Michael Castle, R-Del., and the other Republicans.

<HEADLINE> Two Texas Cops Accused of Torture  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN PARROTT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DESOTO, Texas (AP) -- Two police officers -- a former officer of
the year and her husband -- were charged with beating and sexually
assaulting their 13-year-old nephew who was in their care.
</P>
<P>
   The boy and his 16-year-old sister, who says she also was
physically abused, had been placed with Lt. William Homer Ransom
and Sgt. Judith Corkran Ransom after years of abuse by their
parents, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, who have each worked for the DeSoto Police
Department for about 20 years, were indicted last week by an Ellis
County grand jury and arrested on Tuesday. They remained in the
county jail on Wednesday, with bond set at $100,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   The Ransoms' attorney, George Milner III, said the couple never
abused the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no truth to the allegations,'' Milner said.
</P>
<P>
   Milner said the Ransoms would use corporal punishment on the
child when he would misbehave.
</P>
<P>
   ''In this case there is nothing excessive or unusual,'' he said.
''I think there is a misunderstanding of certain physical evidence,
and I think it is being driven by the hands of deception by a
16-year-old girl.''
</P>
<P>
   DeSoto Police Chief Mike Brodnax said he believes the Ransoms'
actions have been misunderstood and that the children may be lying
to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The boy has learning and physical disabilities, he said.
</P>
<P>
   William Ransom, 53, was indicted on one count of aggravated
sexual assault of a child and nine counts of injury to a child.
Judith Ransom, 54, was charged with one count of aggravated sexual
assault of a child and three counts of injury to a child.

<HEADLINE> Bucks 101, Cavaliers 100  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Ray Allen made the second of two free throws
with 4.9 seconds left to give Milwaukee a 101-100 victory over the
Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday night, moving the Bucks into a tie
in the race for the NBA's only remaining postseason berth.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee (39-39) entered the day a game behind eighth-place
Orlando (39-39) in the Eastern Conference, but the Magic lost at
Boston, 95-91.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams have four games left, including an April 17 showdown
at Orlando. If they finish with identical records, Milwaukee would
go to the playoffs because they lead the season series 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   After Allen's go-ahead free throw and a timeout, Cleveland's
Danny Ferry inbounded the ball at halfcourt to Bob Sura, who drove
and stopped just before the foul line for a jump shot that fell
short of the rim as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Cassell scored 18 of his game-high 29 points in the second
half to spark Milwaukee. Cassell had 11 points in the third quarter
as Milwaukee turned a 62-53 halftime deficit into an 82-80 lead.
The Bucks used a 13-0 run in the middle of the quarter to take
command.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley Person led Cleveland with 21 points. His 3-pointer with
21.3 seconds to play tied the score at 100. That capped an 8-0 run
over a 2:03 span by the Cavaliers.
</P>
<P>
   Allen scored 27 points and Glenn Robinson had 20 as the Bucks'
starting five outscored the Cleveland starters 87-45. The
Cavaliers' starting forwards, Shawn Kemp and Lamond Murray, shot a
combined 4-for-21 from the field. Kemp, limited to 19 minutes
because of early foul trouble, finished with 11 points. Murray
scored six points in 22 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Person had 12 points, Ferry 11 and Sura 10 in the first half as
Cleveland shot 55 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Allen had made 30 of 51 (.588) shots from 3-point range in
his previous 12 games, but shot just 1-for-6 from beyond the arc.
... Cleveland had won 15 of the previous 18 meetings in Cleveland.
... The loss was Cleveland's 10th in its last 57 games when scoring
100 points.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Blasts U.S. on Tuna Imports  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexican authorities said Wednesday a U.S.
federal court ruling on ''dolphin-safe'' labels that effectively
extends the U.S. ban on Mexican tuna was unfair and uninformed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a great loss for Mexico,'' said Dalia de la Pena Wing,
spokeswoman for the Secretariat of Environment, Natural Resources
and Fisheries.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson on Tuesday blocked the
Clinton administration's attempts to loosen standards for
''dolphin-safe'' tuna, a label fishermen need to sell their fish in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The change would have given the designation to the method of
catching tuna Mexican fishermen use, even though they often trap
dolphins in the same nets used to snare tuna.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico argues its industry does not harm the dolphins because
they are immediately released from the nets.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling ''disregards all the scientific evidence that the
U.S. government presented with the backing and participation of
many serious environmental groups,'' a statement from the
environment secretariat said. It was ''not only unfair, but clearly
uninformed.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed by environmental activists arguing that
the labeling change weakened U.S. laws protecting dolphins.
Henderson ruled the U.S. Commerce Department improperly concluded
the change would have no significant adverse impact on dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department issued a news release Wednesday
expressing disappointment in the judge's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a consensus among many environmental groups ... that
our actions are the right thing to do to protect dolphins during
tuna fishing operations,'' Secretary of Commerce William M. Daley
said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only incentive that the international fishing fleet has is
access to our markets. If they can't sell their tuna here, they'll
sell it to countries that do not require the same labeling
standards. And the environmental groups that support us also
understand this concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace's Mexico chapter said the ban has promoted the
expansion of other more devastating practices, such as the killing
of thousands of small marine species used for bait in catching
''dolphin safe'' tuna.
</P>
<P>
   The group's statement urged authorities ''not to pass off
protectionist measures in the name of conservation.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has been battling for nine years to re-enter the U.S.
market after being banned because of concerns about the dolphins.
Officials estimate the embargo has cost the country $50 million
annually.
</P>
<P>
   Before the ban, Mexico exported more than 80,000 tons of tuna a
year to the United States. It exports less than 20,000 tons to
Japan and Europe, while the remaining 125,000 tons of tuna fished
annually from Mexican waters is sold domestically.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. authorities last year agreed to lift the embargo, but no
Mexican tuna has been allowed into the United States because none
qualified for the ''dolphin safe'' label.

<HEADLINE> Knicks 91, Nets 89, OT  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN, AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Winning the Atlantic Division might be possible
after all for the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Latrell Sprewell scored 21 points and Larry Johnson atoned for
two late missed free throws by playing tight defense on Keith Van
Horn on the game's final play as the Knicks edged the New Jersey
Nets 91-89 in overtime Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   With Miami losing by 17 points at Detroit, the victory pulled
the Knicks back within one game of the Heat in the division
standings.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the Knicks are actually two games back since Miami
owns the tiebreaker, but New York has the easier schedule playing
Toronto, Cleveland, Detroit and Boston over the season's final week
while the Heat must play Indiana, Orlando, Toronto and Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell scored six of the Knicks' first eight points in
overtime, but then lost his dribble and committed his fourth
turnover of the night. Consecutive jumpers by Johnny Newman and
Lucious Harris tied it at 89-89 with 42 seconds left, and Charlie
Ward gave the lead back to the Knicks by making two foul shots with
35 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Elliot Perry then lost his dribble and Johnson came up with the
steal, but Johnson missed both foul shots with 15 seconds left to
give the Nets one final chance.
</P>
<P>
   Tightly guarded by Johnson, Van Horn could only manage an
airball jump hook with three seconds left. The Knicks rebounded and
ran out the clock to escape with a victory that was harder to earn
than it should have been against a team that was missing three
starters, playing the second night of back-to-back games and came
into Madison Square Garden with a seven-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing added 18 points, Ward had 13 points, seven rebounds and
five assists and Allan Houston scored 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn led the Nets with 32 points and Newman added 16.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets had a chance to win at the end of regulation, but Jamie
Feick was unable to convert a 3-footer off the glass just before
the buzzer. On the previous possession, Ewing had a chance to give
the Knicks a lead but missed one of two free throws for an 80-80
tie.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets led 52-40 at halftime, and Kendall Gill hit a jumper as
the shot clock expired 2{ minutes into the third quarter to make it
61-45.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter the Knicks seemed to realize how pathetic
they looked, and they started scrambling for loose balls, grabbing
offensive rebounds and pushing the ball upcourt.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing hit two free throws with 2:31 left in the third to start
the Knicks on a 10-0 run that pulled them to 67-66 early in the
fourth, and they finally took their first lead since the first
quarter on a jumper in transition by Houston with 9:21 left to make
it 70-69.
</P>
<P>
Notes: New Jersey's eight-game losing streak is its longest of the
season. The Nets are 10-22 in games decided by five points or less.
... The Knicks won the season series 3-1. ... The Nets have lost
seven straight at the Garden. ... New Jersey's Kendall Gill, one of
the best defenders in the league, said Alonzo Mourning of Miami is
his choice for defensive player of the year. ... Knicks forward
John Wallace, out with a sprained ankle, is expected to be
activated in time for Friday's night's game at Toronto.

<HEADLINE> Marlins 11, Brewers 4  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Alex Gonzalez's two-run single in the fifth
inning keyed the Florida Marlins' 11-4 victory over the Milwaukee
Brewers at frigid County Stadium on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The temperature was 41 degrees at gametime, and it dropped
precipitously as bitter winds whipped off Lake Michigan and turned
the field into an icebox.
</P>
<P>
   Many players wore several layers of clothing, and the cold made
fielders less sure-handed and left several pitchers unable to
maintain consistent control. Derrek Lee homered in the Florida
eighth and rounded the bases while blowing into his hands to keep
them warm.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after more than 53,000 fans turned out for opening day
in Milwaukee, the announced attendance was 7,007, though no more
than 2,000 fans were in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Jaime Navarro (0-2) walked six batters in 4 2-3 innings,
including Cliff Floyd, Preston Wilson and Kevin Millar to load the
bases in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, hitting .097 entering the game and banished to the
seventh spot in the order, then brought home two runs with a single
to put Florida up 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins added two more in the sixth on a single by Luis
Castillo, a triple by Mark Kotsay and a sacrifice fly by Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Bautista, a defensive replacement, hit a three-run homer
in the Marlins ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Sanchez (1-0) got the win while allowing six hits and four
earned runs in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Hernandez homered in the second inning and had a
run-scoring single in the fourth for the Brewers, who had just as
much trouble with the freezing temperatures as the warm-weather
Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Geoff Jenkins appeared to strain his arm when he
made a hard throw on a sacrifice fly in the fifth inning.
Notes: Brewers reliever Jim Bruske (prounced Brewsky) got a warm
ovation from the inebriated portion of the crowd when his name was
announced on the County Stadium P.A. in the fifth inning. Bruske,
who won the Brewers' first game of the season, was making his home
debut. ... A foul ball in the sixth inning flew into the booth of
Brewers play-by-play voice Bob Uecker. He couldn't catch it, and
several fans good-naturedly booed the popular announcer. ... Team
officials announced that Miller Park, the Brewers' retractable-roof
home being built just behind the outfield bleachers at County
Stadium, is 80 percent complete. It will open in April 2001.

<HEADLINE> James Vorenberg Dies at 72  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA VOZZELLA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- James Vorenberg, a former Harvard Law School dean
and associate special prosecutor during Watergate, died Wednesday.
He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Vorenberg served as law school dean from 1981 to 1989 and taught
criminal law and legal ethics at Harvard at the time of his death.
He suffered a heart attack Monday and was admitted to Massachusetts
General Hospital, where he died Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Vorenberg served as Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox's
principal assistant from 1973 to 1975. He often said his biggest
claim to fame came when reporters at a news conference asked Cox a
question he did not want to answer. ''Talk to my lawyer,'' Cox
said, pointing to Vorenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Vorenberg served as director of the Justice Department's office
of criminal justice under Attorney General Robert Kennedy. His
responsibilities included encouraging the FBI to improve its
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ''The notion that a Harvard professor was going to affect J.
Edgar Hoover in any way struck me as pretty optimistic,'' Vorenberg
told the Harvard alumni magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Vorenberg co-authored a cookbook called ''Dean Cuisine, Or, the
Liberated Man's Guide to Fine Cooking,'' with Jack Greenberg, then
vice dean of Columbia Law School. The book received a positive
review from his friend and fellow Cambridge resident Julia Child.
</P>
<P>
   Born Jan. 10, 1928, Vorenberg earned his undergraduate and
graduate degrees from Harvard. He served as a law clerk to Supreme
Court Justice Felix Frankfurter from 1953 to 1954. He joined the
Harvard faculty in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Vorenberg leaves a wife and several children. Funeral
arrangements were pending.

<HEADLINE> Stars 2, Oilers 1  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Stars are trying to defend their
Stanley Cup with the same boring style that won it. The only
difference is they now have a few new faces playing it.
</P>
<P>
   Roman Lyashenko, a 20-year-old rookie forward who earned his
keep by playing the defense-first system coach Ken Hitchcock
demands, scored the tiebreaking goal with 8:29 left to give Dallas
a 2-1 victory over Edmonton in the playoff opener Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 is Thursday night at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers tied it seven minutes into the final period when
Roman Titov stole a clearing pass from Darryl Sydor and fired it
past Stars goalie Ed Belfour. It was the first playoff goal against
Belfour in 123:30, a streak that began with the Cup-clinching
triple-overtime victory against Buffalo last year.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Keane gave Dallas a 1-0 lead late in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour had it easy this time as his defense limited the Oilers
to 14 shots. Edmonton went 15:50 into the second period without
taking a shot and had just three in the final period.
</P>
<P>
   The one-goal Dallas victory has been a trend when these teams
meet -- and they meet often.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, facing the Oilers in a fourth straight postseason,
have beaten Edmonton in eight straight playoff games. Dallas has
won 10 in a row at Reunion Arena. Since the Oilers eliminated the
Stars from the 1997 playoffs, Dallas holds an 18-2-1 advantage. The
Stars' last eight victories have been by one goal.
</P>
<P>
   Oilers goalie Tommy Salo stopped 30 shots, usually smothering or
catching them to prevent the Stars from taking second chances.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas blew several scoring opportunities by missing on
centering passes or sending it into open ice.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars finally broke through with 7:28 left in the second
when Keane slid the puck between the legs of Jason Smith, who had
just turned it over near Edmonton's blue line, and flipped it over
Salo's left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Langenbrunner poked in a rebound of a shot by Brenden
Morrow later in the period, but it was waved off because Scott
Thornton was caught holding during Morrow's shot.
</P>
<P>
   Lyashenko, who had six goals in 58 regular-season games, was in
the right place at the right time for his first postseason goal.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton's Igor Ulanov was trying to clear a great stick save by
Salo, but instead put the puck right on the Russian rookie's stick.
He flicked it towards the goal and Salo, who was still sprawled on
the ice, never had a chance.
</P>
<P>
   The goal by Titov was his first for the Oilers since being
acquired at the trading deadline from Pittsburgh.

<HEADLINE> Gun Control Campaign Seeking Moms  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHORT HILLS, N.J. (AP) -- It took an unforgettable image of young
children escaping a racist gunman to transform Donna Dees-Thomases
from a wealthy suburban mother into a grassroots activist.
</P>
<P>
   The image was from Aug. 10, when a white supremacist opened fire
on a Jewish Community Center in Granada Hills, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Dees-Thomases was flipping channels when she saw the video of
children the same age as her daughters crossing the street
hand-in-hand with police officers.
</P>
<P>
   ''These were my kids crossing the street,'' Dees-Thomases said.
''My kids go to a JCC. Anybody could walk in. It was just crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   One week later, Dees-Thomases registered a Web site, and
launched the Million Mom March campaign. The grassroots effort is
expected to become the nation's largest gun control demonstration
to date.
</P>
<P>
   The Mother's Day rally is expected to draw 100,000 people to the
National Mall in Washington, D.C. Other demonstrations are
scheduled in 20 cities nationwide, including Tulsa, Okla., Los
Angeles, Denver and Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   The group is pressing Congress for stricter gun control,
including measures to require all handgun owners to be licensed and
registered, require built-in child safety locks and limit handgun
purchases to one a month.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mothers are certainly an important voice in this debate, and
they are a voice that has not been very strong until this point,''
said Shannon Frattaroli, researcher at the Center for Gun Policy
and Research at Johns Hopkins University.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have yet to see really a grass roots movement in this area,
and maybe that's what is needed in order to change voting
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   National Rifle Association spokesman Bill Powers said the
organization was unconcerned about the appeal of the May 14 rally.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is one of the great freedoms of America'' to express
oneself politically, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the Granada Hills shooting, Dees-Thomases considered
herself rather apolitical. Today, her cluttered basement office in
this wealthy suburban community is adorned by bright pink posters
and T-shirts reading, ''We're looking for a few good moms.''
</P>
<P>
   Dees-Thomases, a part-time publicist for David Letterman's
late-night talk show, chose the name Million Mom March to borrow on
the success of the Million Man March rally for black empowerment in
Washington in 1995, and the subsequent Million Youth March.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has grown -- mostly by word of mouth -- to at least
500 mothers working out of their homes and out of an office in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers have recruited marchers by calling parent-teacher
groups, churches, synagogues and women's groups for support,
Dees-Thomases said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a true instinct of mothers protecting their children,''
she said. ''I think it is totally primitive.''
</P>
<P>
   The group also has received a $300,000 grant from the Funders'
Collective for Gun Violence Prevention, part of the nonprofit Open
Society Institute established by billionaire George Soros. It also
sells T-shirts for $25, the same price as an annual NRA membership.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is just common sense. These are handguns,'' she said.
''This is just stuff that should have been done 25 years ago.''

<HEADLINE> Homer the Seal Seals Off Boat Ramp  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GISBORNE, New Zealand (AP) -- A two-ton seal is causing problems
in a small New Zealand town, crunching cars, trailers and trees as
he tries to scratch an insatiable itch.
</P>
<P>
   Nicknamed Homer by locals -- after the overweight father
character in ''The Simpsons'' television show -- the 4,400-pound
elephant seal took up residence two weeks ago at a boat ramp in
Gisborne, 250 miles north of the capital of Wellington.
</P>
<P>
   He has been a draw for sightseers ever since, but has become a
pest by using cars, boat trailers and other objects as scratching
posts.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Thursday they also fear he could harm people who
venture too near.
</P>
<P>
   Lumbering around the parking lot near the ramp, Homer has
approached empty cars, reared onto his hindquarters then brought
down his massive bulk on fenders, bumpers and mirrors, squashing
them.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's damaged three vehicles to our knowledge, he's destroyed a
rubbish tin, he's flattened a couple of boat trailers, and he's
destroyed a tree,'' said Jamie Quirk, a conservation department
officer. ''He gets quite aggressive at times.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservation department officers have posted signs warning
bystanders to keep clear of the heavyweight visitor, and are
examining ways of encouraging him to find a new home.
</P>
<P>
   Local fishermen say Homer is blocking the boat ramp and stopping
them from entering the water, but no one has been willing to try to
shift the beast.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of the time he is just playing, leaning on something or
trying to scratch himself,'' said Jill Hudson of the Conservation
Department.

<HEADLINE> Ky. Teen Survives 100-Foot Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- A teen-age runaway fell 100-feet down a
cliff, broke both arms, shattered a hip and then lay in the
underbrush for four days.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, 17-year-old Harold Chandler Jr. managed to
crawl 50 feet on his elbows to the edge of the Cumberland River,
where a fisherman finally heard his cries for help.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Kentucky Hospital, with his mother at his
side, Chandler said Tuesday that he couldn't recall which had been
worse -- the pain or the fear.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said 'Lord, if you let me make it through, I'll never run
away again.'''
</P>
<P>
   The spot where Chandler fell on March 26 was near the bank of
the Cumberland River in Pulaski County. A few hours earlier, he'd
run away from the Kentucky Baptist Home for Children, a home for
students with discipline problems.
</P>
<P>
   He was sent there four months ago after being expelled from
Lexington Day Treatment Center, which handles students who have had
problems in other special education programs.

<HEADLINE> MCI WorldCom To Sell Debt Securities  </HEADLINE>
By MATT MOORE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- MCI WorldCom hopes to sell $15 billion in
debt securities, the proceeds of which would go toward corporate
expenses and upgrading its national and international networks.
</P>
<P>
   The company filed a request Wednesday for advance approval from
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Drake Johnstone, an analyst with Richmond, Va.-based Davenport &AMP;
Co., said MCI's shelf filing gives it the flexibility to decide how
much it sells and when.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the next few years MCI WorldCom will have to spend a lot
of money both deploying more networks to support its growth in the
Internet and also to expand its international network,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the filing, MCI would use the proceeds of the sale
for more acquisitions, paying down existing debt, and other
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   MCI is in the process of upgrading its existing networks and
plans to establish a national fixed wireless network. The moves
come as the company prepares to offer residential users access to
cable and high speed Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   Johnstone said MCI, which currently focuses on corporate
clients, could use some of the revenue from the sale to beef up its
national infrastructure and increase its revenue stream by making
its network available to residential consumers during evening
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want to capture more spending from the residential side
because that additional traffic tends to be in the evening,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of MCI's traffic is business-related and is done during
the day.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton-based MCI WorldCom is the second-largest
telecommunications company in the United States. It is acquiring
Kansas City-based Sprint Corp. in a deal worth $115 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders with both companies are scheduled to vote on the
merger April 28. The deal also requires approval by U.S. and
European regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of MCI WorldCom fell $1 to close at $41.37{ at 4 p.m.
Wednesday on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Welcomes Peru Runoff Vote  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department welcomed Peru's
announcement Wednesday that a presidential runoff will be
necessary, calling it a first step toward restoring credibility to
the electoral process.
</P>
<P>
   The department commented shortly after Peru announced that
President Alberto Fujimori had failed to win an absolute majority,
thus requiring a runoff election with leading contender Alejandro
Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   A department spokeswoman, asking not to be identified, said the
outcome corresponded to the findings of five separate independent
monitoring groups and polling firms.
</P>
<P>
   She urged that the Peruvian government and electoral officials
''take every possible measure'' to ensure a free and fair process
in the runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, department spokesman James P. Rubin had said
the United States would have ''serious, serious questions'' if the
final vote count showed Fujimori with more than 50 percent support,
contradicting the findings of the independent analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin spoke before the final returns were announced.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do expect there to be a second round,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   If there is convincing proof of fraud, ''the government of Peru
will face a substantial challenge in restoring its credibility, not
only with the people of Peru but with the international community
and the United States government,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was premature to speculate on what measures the
United States would take if it were convinced the election was
fraudulent.

<HEADLINE> Citadel Gets Female Voting Member  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A woman was approved by the state
Legislature on Wednesday to take a seat on the board of The
Citadel, making her the first voting female member of the military
school's governing body.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers approved Allison Dean Wright, 35, for one of two open
seats on the board. Wright received a graduate degree in business
from the school's evening college in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   As an advisory member since 1997, Wright was able to discuss
ideas but not vote on them. ''Now I'll know I'll be able to make
difference,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   W. Henry Johnson Junior won the second seat. They replace Jimmy
Jones, who chaired the board during the fight to keep women out of
the military school, and current Chairman Frank Mood.
</P>
<P>
   The formerly all-male corps of cadets graduated its first woman
last year. There are about 60 women cadets at the school now.
</P>
<P>
   The Citadel dropped its all-male admissions policy in 1996,
after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a similar policy at
Virginia Military Institute.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PALOS HEIGHTS, Ill. (AP) -- J. Emmett Clair, a meatpacker whose
early patronage of Green Bay football helped establish the NFL
team's name, died Sunday of pneumonia. He was 102.
</P>
<P>
   Clair went to Green Bay in 1919 to join his brother in running
the Acme Packing Co. That was when he was approached by Curly
Lambeau's father to sponsor a local team.
</P>
<P>
   Clair agreed, and Acme obtained a franchise in the American
Professional Football Association. But that only lasted for the two
years the elder Clair remained in Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   When the Clair brothers left Green Bay, Lambeau took over the
team and obtained a franchise in the NFL. But he kept the Packers
name.
James Marston Fitch:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- James Marston Fitch, an architect whose writings
and teachings helped further the cause of preservationists, died
Monday. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Fitch said respect for older buildings made environmental and
economic sense. He was recognized for popularizing the preservation
of historical buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Fitch was the director of historic preservation at Beyer Blinder
Belle, the Manhattan architectural firm that recently completed a
renovation of Grand Central Terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Before and after World War II, Fitch was an editor at
Architectural Record, Architectural Forum and House Beautiful in
New York. His books include ''Architecture and the Esthetics of
Plenty'' (1961) and ''Historic Preservation: Curatorial Management
of the Built World'' (1982).
Robert W. Komer:
</P>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Robert W. Komer, a leader of the Johnson
administration's attempts to win hearts and minds in Vietnam who
earned the nickname ''Blowtorch Bob'' for his fiery defense of
American involvement in the region, died Sunday after suffering a
stroke. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Komer had been an aide to Gen. William C. Westmoreland, who
commanded U.S. forces in Vietnam from 1964 to 1968.
</P>
<P>
   President Johnson put Komer in charge of the program known as
pacification, the use of information and propaganda to gain
political and social control of South Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Komer produced a stream of statistics to support his view that
the war could be won.
</P>
<P>
   Though Komer was convinced at the time that the United States
could win in Vietnam, he said many years later that the war was ''a
strategic disaster which cost us 57,000 lives and a half trillion
dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   In October 1968, Johnson named Komer ambassador to Turkey. He
was replaced in January 1969 when Richard Nixon became president.

</P>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Diane Marie Munso, a Department of
Corrections manager who helped oversee California's $5 billion

</P>
<P>
   Munso, chief of the prison system's construction support branch,
was honored in 1991 by then-Gov. George Deukmejian for outstanding
dedication and leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Munso was a member of the Holy Spirit School board, was a parent
service coordinator at St. Francis High School and team mother for
the High Voltage volleyball club.
</P>
<P>
   Munso began her state government career as an entry-level clerk
at the Department of Motor Vehicles during her first year at
California State University, Sacramento.
Pete Springer:

<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- State Sen. Pete Springer, a champion of
education and a critic of prison privatization who represented the
25th District for 12 years, died Wednesday of an apparent heart
attack. He was 55.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved a resolution honoring Springer for his years
of public service.
</P>
<P>
   Springer was chairman of the Senate Government Operations
Committee, treasurer of the Senate Democratic Caucus and a member
of select oversight committees on education and children and youth.
</P>
<P>
   Among Springer's education fights, the former teacher and
principal opposed a bill last year that would have allowed only
school officials, not police, to conduct strip-searches when they
suspected a student was carrying a weapon.

   Known for his self-deprecating wit and his cooking skills,
Vorenberg co-authored a cookbook called ''Dean Cuisine, Or, the
Liberated Man's Guide to Fine Cooking,'' with Jack Greenberg, then
vice dean of Columbia Law School. The book received a positive
review from his friend and fellow Cambridge resident Julia Child.
</P>
<P>
   Vorenberg served as law school dean from 1981 to 1989 and,
despite a long battle with Parkinson's disease, taught criminal law
and legal ethics at Harvard at the time of his death.
</P>
<P>
   Vorenberg served as Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox's
principal assistant from 1973 to 1975. He often said his biggest
claim to fame came when reporters at a news conference asked Cox a
question he did not want to answer. ''Talk to my lawyer,'' Cox
said, pointing to Vorenberg.

<HEADLINE> Aid Groups: Protect Civilians  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- International aid groups are urging the
Security Council to prioritize the protection of civilians in wars,
with one group suggesting council members waive veto power when
considering the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors Without Borders on Wednesday echoed a recent
recommendation from a U.N. University Study that the five permanent
members lose their veto power if the threat of veto impedes council
action to prevent a massive humanitarian catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   The organization's president, Dr. James Orbinski, noted that
veto power prevented U.N. action in Rwanda in 1994 and is currently
hindering U.N. action to protect civilians in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Security Council must recognize and insist that the
humanitarian must remain independent of the political,'' Orbinski
said.
</P>
<P>
   The five permanent Security Council members -- the United States,
Britain, France, Russia and China -- can veto any Security Council
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The calls came in an unusual closed meeting of the 15-member
council with aid groups such as Doctors Without Borders, Oxfam and
CARE International, who briefed ambassadors on their experiences
protecting innocents during war.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Smith-Lomas, emergencies director for Oxfam Great Britain,
said the aid groups welcomed the opportunity to address the
council.
</P>
<P>
   ''But we must remember to focus on the fact that what we need to
see is a change in protection and the change in people's lives on
the ground,'' he told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council is scheduled to hold an open debate on the
topic of protecting civilians next Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Blues 5, Sharks 3  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Blues didn't miss leading scorer
Pavol Demitra a bit in their playoff opener.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues got two goals and an assist from third-line winger
Jochen Hecht, a 13-goal scorer in the regular season, in Wednesday
night's 5-3 victory over the San Jose Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL's top-seeded team has plugged various players into coach
Joel Quenneville's system all season, filling in during injuries to
Al MacInnis and Pierre Turgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 of the Western Conference series is Saturday at St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Roman Turek overcame a shaky beginning to his first
playoff start and Lubos Bartecko and Marty Reasoner each scored his
first career playoff goal for the Blues, who had a franchise-record
114 points in the regular season. Hecht snapped a 2-2 tie with the
only goal of the second period and Chris Pronger added a
third-period power-play goal for St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues were 4-0-1 in the regular season against the Sharks,
who had a franchise-record 87 points but a sub-.500 record.
</P>
<P>
   Two unlikely sources of offense, Dave Lowry and Mike Rathje,
scored for the eighth-seeded Sharks. Lowry, who scored on a wrist
shot at the 46-second mark of the first period, had one goal in the
regular season. Rathje had two.
</P>
<P>
   Owen Nolan, who had 44 goals, scored with San Jose shorthanded
with 5:20 to go, making it 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Demitra, who had 28 goals and 75 points in the regular season,
sustained a concussion March 23 and isn't expected back at least
until the second round. The Blues also were without right wing
Scott Young, who had 24 goals. Young is expected back from a
dislocated right shoulder for the game on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Turek, who saw no action in the playoffs as the backup to Ed
Belfour on Stanley Cup champion Dallas last season, gave up a goal
on the first shot he saw as Lowry found himself alone in the slot.
</P>
<P>
   Turek is 7-0-1 for his career in the regular season against the
Sharks and allowed only two more goals on the last 30 shots he
faced.
</P>
<P>
   Hecht was one of 12 players on a deep roster to score 10 or more
goals, finishing with 34 points in 63 games. He broke a 2-2 tie on
a rebound shot at 2:29 of the second.
</P>
<P>
   Pronger made it a two-goal gap at 3:45 when he knocked in a
rebound from mid-air on a power play before Shields could glove the
puck. Reasoner made it 5-2 on a backhander at 8:49, just a few
seconds after Shields thwarted Hecht's bid for a hat trick from the
slot.
</P>
<P>
   After Lowry set the tone for the high-scoring first period, the
Blues took the lead on a backhander by Hecht at 5:41 and a rebound
shot by Bartecko 1:54 later.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks, after going about 13 minutes without a shot, tied it
when Rathje's shot from the right circle deflected off two players
before eluding Turek at 18:18.

<HEADLINE> Sioux Celebrate Hockey Title  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH HOFFNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND FORKS, N.D. (AP) -- The University of North Dakota
celebrated its winning hockey tradition Wednesday with a rally that
included past players and several thousand fans who welcomed home
the national champions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a great year for our team. Right from the get-go we
were a team that had a chance to win the championship,'' said
senior center Jason Ulmer, who scored the game-winning goal in the
4-2 championship game victory over Boston College on Saturday in
Providence. ''It's been a great four years for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Ulmer is one of four seniors who were also part of North
Dakota's 1997 championship. Lee Goren, another senior, was
ineligible for that team because he had played for a junior team in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   North Dakota (31-8-5) was a young team that played its best
hockey in the postseason en route to the school's seventh national
title.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can honestly say that this team overachieved and worked as
hard as any team that we've had here in North Dakota,'' said
sixth-year head coach Dean Blais, a former Sioux assistant.
</P>
<P>
   School President Charles Kupchella read letters of
congratulation from North Dakota's governor, congressional
delegation and university chancellor. Past players, including Las
Vegas casino owner Ralph Engelstad, thanked the Sioux for the
latest title. Engelstad, a former goalie, has donated $50 million
to help the Sioux build a new hockey arena.
</P>
<P>
   ''You had a dream and you went to work and you worked hard
enough to take you right to the top. You did it. Enjoy it. Savor
it. You earned it,'' Engelstad said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sioux have won five national titles in the past 20 years.
Their championships have come in 1959, 1963, 1980, 1982, 1987, 1997
and 2000.

<HEADLINE> Pirates 6, Expos 4  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- There aren't many better hitters in a pinch
than John Vander Wal -- not now, not ever.
</P>
<P>
   Vander Wal hit his second homer in three pinch-hit at-bats this
season, a three-run drive that rallied the Pittsburgh Pirates past
the Montreal Expos 6-4 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Vander Wal's sixth-inning shot off reliever Miguel Batista
overcame a 4-3 deficit and was his 15th career pinch-homer, and his
second in nine days. He had a two-run homer in the opener against
Houston on April 4.
</P>
<P>
   Vander Wal, acquired from San Diego for Al Martin to upgrade
what was one of the NL's worst benches last season, moved into
sixth place in career pinch-homers and ninth place with 110 career
pinch-hits.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Expos manager Felipe Alou waved a stat sheet showing
Vander Wal hit a remarkable .522 last season with an 0-1 count --
normally, a situation where the pitcher is in control.
</P>
<P>
   ''What was the count when he hit the home run?'' Alou said.
''0-and-1. And there wasn't a whole lot we could do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as he did in the opener, Vander Wal came off the bench to
homer in temperatures that had dipped into the 30s.
</P>
<P>
   Or, actually, he came out of the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it's cold like this, I watch one inning, then go back and
take some hacks against the pitching machine,'' Vander Wal said.
''There's no way I can stay loose sitting in the dugout in
35-degree weather. I did the same thing when I played in Denver.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou wasn't surprised to see Pirates manager Gene Lamont use his
best pinch-hitter relatively early in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the right way to do it,'' Alou said. ''You never know
if you're going to get another man on base.''
</P>
<P>
   Batista (0-1), a former Rule 5 pick who spent a few weeks with
the Pirates in 1992, replaced starter Carl Pavano to start the
sixth and quickly struck out Wil Cordero and Warren Morris. He then
got ahead in the count 0-and-2 before walking Aramis Ramirez, who
was 1-for-15, and Chad Hermansen singled.
</P>
<P>
   Vander Wal then lifted an opposite-field drive over the
left-center field wall, helping end the Pirates' three-game losing
streak and the Expos' three-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates, in danger of falling into last place in the NL
Central, had lost five of seven and the Expos had won five of six
following an 0-2 start.
</P>
<P>
   Pavano pitched much better than he did in allowing 15 earned
runs in four innings in two starts against Pittsburgh last season.
But he couldn't hold a 3-1 lead as left fielder Rondell White's
error led to a two-run fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Cabrera's two-run double in fifth off Francisco Cordova
had put Montreal ahead. But Pavano walked Jason Kendall with one
out in the bottom half and Pat Meares' single glanced off White's
glove and bounded nearly to the wall, scoring Kendall and sending
Meares to third.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Giles, who had a run-scoring double in the second,
followed with a sacrifice fly. Giles' long drive in the second
ricocheted off the yellow stripe atop the right field wall and
probably missed by an inch of being a three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Cordova breezed through the first three innings on a chilly
night, giving him 10 hitless innings in his first 11 as a starter
this season. He pitched 7 1-3 no-hit innings against Houston on
Thursday before yielding two hits.
</P>
<P>
   But Cordova hurt himself by failing to handle Jose Vidro's
bouncer in the fourth for an error that led to Vladimir Guerrero's
run-scoring grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Silva (1-0) got the final two outs in the sixth for the
victory. Jason Christiansen followed with 1 2-3 scoreless innings,
and Mike Williams got the final four outs for the Pirates' first
save this season. Williams had a 14.48 ERA in the final six weeks
of last season.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to get him back to where he was before the All-Star
break last season,'' Lamont said. ''We'll give some other guys a
chance to save games, but he's earned the right to get the
opportunity now.''
</P>
<P>
Notes: The gametime temperature was 46, and it kept dropping. The
temperature has been in the 40s for four of the Pirates' five home
games. ... Cabrera is 3-for-4 against Cordova. ... Pavano's career
ERA against Pittsburgh prior to Wednesday was 33.75. ... Guerrero
has not struck out in 56 at-bats since Sept. 25. ... The Pirates
had lost three of their first four at home. ... ... Kendall was in
a 4-for-21 slump before getting two hits. Lamont said he didn't
rest Kendall because the catcher gets too anxious and nervous when
he sits during a slump.

<HEADLINE> Reno Meeting With Elian Kin Ends  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX VEIGA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno took an
extraordinary step to resolve the Elian Gonzalez case Wednesday,
flying to Miami and personally urging his relatives to end the
wrenching 4{-month custody struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Reno met for 2{ hours with the boy's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez
and cousin Marisleysis at the Miami Beach home of Sister Jeanne
O'Laughlin, the nun who was host of a January meeting between Elian
and his grandmothers from Cuba. Elian attended the meeting, moving
from lap to lap at the table.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting ended without a concrete agreement to hand him over,
O'Laughlin said. She said the family and Reno were cordial.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was very respectful and they were very honest,''
O'Laughlin said. ''The pain of this family and their understanding
of the pain of Juan Miguel was very evident. They have expressed
over and over again their ... desire to be a loving family, whole
again.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no deadline issued and no letter delivered detailing
handover plans, though O'Laughlin said there was talk of a meeting
Thursday in Washington involving the Miami relatives. She said
attorneys for the two sides would speak late Wednesday or early
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   One option Reno had planned to propose was for Elian and some of
his Miami relatives to come back to Washington, perhaps even on her
plane, to arrange a meeting with the boy's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, and the eventual transfer of custody, according to a
government official, who requested anonymity. Reno left the meeting
without commenting, and immigration officials refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''She wants to do anything possible to resolve this,'' Justice
Department spokesman Myron Marlin said before the meeting. ''She
realizes it's a tall order but believes she may be the one who can
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris
Meissner also attended the meeting. Elian left the room only when
the subject matter with Reno was too sensitive. ''He was precious
with her,'' O'Laughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian and his relatives had left their politically charged
Little Havana neighborhood for O'Laughlin's gated home earlier in
the day. She said Elian would stay there Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The visit at least temporarily postponed the letter the
government had planned to send the Miami relatives Wednesday
telling them where and when to relinquish custody of Elian.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department official, requesting anonymity, said before
the meeting that if Reno and the family could agree on transfer
plans, the letter wouldn't be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Under a government plan, Elian would be transferred either to
his father or another great-uncle, who would take the boy to meet
his father.
</P>
<P>
   Reno had also planned to meet with community leaders in her
hometown, where she served as state attorney for 15 years and where
Cuban exiles now wield signs denouncing her and depicting her with
horns.
</P>
<P>
   Elian, clinging to an inner tube, was rescued by two fishermen
on Thanksgiving after his mother and 10 other Cubans drowned when
their boat sank.
</P>
<P>
   His Miami relatives have been caring for him ever since and have
been fighting in court for him to have an asylum hearing. But the
Clinton administration has ordered Elian back to his father in
Cuba, saying only he can speak for the boy on immigration matters.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge affirmed that decision, but the family has
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father, who met with Reno after coming to America last
week, remained in Bethesda, Md. He indicated Wednesday -- the day
after a meeting in Washington with the Miami relatives was
scheduled and abruptly canceled -- that he was through negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is going to simply ask now that the attorney general issue
a court order and that the boy be returned immediately to him,''
said the Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, who met with him.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, his wife and their infant son were
guests of honor at a reception at the Cuban diplomatic mission in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In Havana, Ricardo Alarcon, the senior Cuban official who has
advised the father, criticized the Miami relatives for delaying the
transfer, saying they were showing ''a total lack of respect for
American society,'' and ''making fun of the U.S. government.''
</P>
<P>
   When O'Laughlin first got involved, she said she had no opinion
about whether the boy should be returned. But after the
grandmothers' visit, she said Elian should stay in the United
States -- drawing bitter criticism from the Cuban government and the
grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
   If Elian's relatives were hoping for a quieter setting in Miami
Beach, they only partially succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   While Reno met with the family, dozens of police and federal
agents kept watch over about 200 demonstrators. Several waved a
Cuban flag bigger than a king-sized bedsheet.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Elian arrived at the house, a crowd chanted ''Elian!
Elian!'' in anticipation. The demonstrators were forced to keep a
greater distance than on Lazaro Gonzalez's narrow street. Police
kept them across a four-lane road, behind a median and a barricade.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reno, coward, Miami has had enough!'' some shouted. Reno left
in a motorcade that included 12 police motorcycles and a dozen
cruisers.
</P>
<P>
   At Lazaro Gonzalez's house, protesters were starting to
acknowledge that Elian may be heading back to Cuba. But the
attorney general's visit to Miami gave some a ray of hope.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now she's not the Cuban-Americans' best friend, but that
could change between today and tomorrow,'' said Rolando Millet, 39.
He held a sign: ''America get ready for a miracle.''

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Rey Sanchez hit a three-run homer off
Mike Trombley in the ninth inning and the Kansas City Royals, again
coming back in their last at-bat, beat the Baltimore Orioles 7-6
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore, which led 6-0 in the seventh, was still ahead 6-4 in
the ninth when Mike Trombley (0-1) walked Gregg Zaun leading off
and Mark Quinn followed with a double.
</P>
<P>
   Next up was Sanchez, and he worked the count to 3-2 before
hitting his first home run of the season, a drive off the top of
the left-field fence that bounced into the Orioles bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Johnny Damon hit a ninth-inning home run for a 6-5
win over Minnesota. In the series opener Tuesday, Brian Johnson's
12th-inning homer gave Kansas City a 7-5 win over the Orioles. At
7-3, the Royals are off to their best start since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken singled in a run to move within four hits of 3,000,
and Mike Bordick had three RBIs for Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Santiago (2-0) won for the second straight night, pitching
two perfect innings.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken, who began the season with 2,991 hits, flared a single
into right field in the seventh, driving in B.J. Surhoff for his
1,576th career RBI, moving him past Jake Beckley for 29th on the
career list.
</P>
<P>
   Royals starter Mac Suzuki allowed five runs -- only two earned --
and five hits in 5 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore scored three unearned runs in the fourth for a 3-0
lead after first baseman Mike Sweeney dropped Harold Baines'
grounder for an error.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken walked, Charles Johnson hit a two-run double with two
outs and Bordick followed with an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore made it 5-0 in the sixth when Suzuki hit Will Clark
with a pitch, Johnson doubled and Bordick followed with a two-run
double off Jerry Spradlin. Ripken's hit made it 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Rapp took a three-hitter into the seventh, when Jermaine Dye
hit a leadoff homer, reliever Buddy Groom walked in a run, and
Sanchez and Damon hit sacrifice flies.
</P>
<P>
   Rapp allowed three runs and five hits in six-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Sanchez made a fine leaping catch of Ripken's liner to
shortstop in his first at-bat. ... Rapp was 12-13 in a career-high
32 starts for the Royals in 1998. ... The game started with three
Kansas City players holding down the top three spots in total bases
among AL players, Sweeney, Joe Randa and Dye. ... After hitting a
two-run double in the sixth, Bordick was thrown out trying to steal
third.

<HEADLINE> Some Mass. Students Boycott Tests  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE IVEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- While some students sharpened their No.
2 pencils, others sharpened their rhetoric Wednesday and boycotted
a statewide achievement test they consider unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's 17 hours that justify whether or not you can get a high
school diploma from the state for your four years of high school,''
said Sarah Bowman, one of 23 Brookline High School students who
refused to take the test.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third year the Massachusetts Comprehensive
Assessment System exam has been administered. The composition
portion was given to all fourth-, eighth- and 10th-graders
Wednesday. Math, science and social studies will be tested in May.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's scores showed more than half of all students either
flunked the MCAS or need improvement. Schools that consistently do
poorly could face state takeover, and in 2003, the state will
require students to pass the exam in order to graduate.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters said the test is unfair to poor test-takers,
poorly funded schools, and special education students and should
not be the sole requirement to graduate. The boycotters faced
repercussions ranging from suspension to agreeing to write about
the test.
</P>
<P>
   State education officials estimated that less than 1 percent of
the 220,000 students scheduled to take the test Wednesday
participated in the boycott.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were very few cases of students boycotting the test,''
Education Commissioner David Driscoll said in a statement. ''Those
cases in my view are minor, and schools were orderly.''

   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Fans in St. Louis are feeling cocky.
</P>
<P>
   Who can blame them?
</P>
<P>
   The Blues are the top seed entering their first-round NHL
playoff matchup against the San Jose Sharks. The Cardinals are 7-2
this season -- their best start since 1986 -- with a National
League-leading 25 home runs. All of this comes on the heels of the
Rams going from the NFL's worst team of the '90s to Super Bowl

   It's no wonder fans are already talking of St. Louis becoming
the first city since the Super Bowl began in 1967 to win three
major professional sports championships in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been saying it for a long time,'' Chris DeGroat said as
the Blues beat the Sharks 5-3 on Wednesday night. ''I can't wait to
say 'I told you so.'''
</P>
<P>
   His girlfriend, Renee Baker, was sporting blue hair and eye
makeup in the team's honor.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're obsessed,'' Baker said. ''We got on the computer and
researched it. We even made a spread sheet. Trust us, it's never
been done before. But that's going to change this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooler heads prevail among those leading the troops into battle.
Although they like their odds, neither Blues coach Joel Quenneville
nor Cardinals manager Tony La Russa is promising championship
trophies to join the one named for Vince Lombardi.
</P>
<P>
   There also is history to consider before plans are put into
motion to change the name of the Gateway City to Titletown. Only
two cities have ever claimed even two titles in the same year:
Pittsburgh, with the Pirates and Steelers in 1979; and New York,
where the Mets and Jets won in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   ''We get a lot of calls from people wondering when the last time
a city had three winners,'' said Kenny Strode, an executive
producer and host on KFNS, the city's all-sports radio station.
''We can't find that it's ever happened.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis is better known for flop teams than front-runners.
Consider: Since the Cardinals won the World Series in 1967, the
city had only one championship team -- the 1982 Cardinals -- before
the Rams beat the Tennessee Titans 23-16 in the Super Bowl in
January.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues have never won the Stanley Cup, though they went to
the finals their first three seasons. It wasn't as remarkable as it
seems, because the NHL placed the six new expansion teams in one
division while keeping the six established teams in the other. St.
Louis was swept in all three finals.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the Blues have been a model of mediocrity. While
they've qualified for the playoffs a league-record 21 straight
years, they haven't made it past the second round since 1986, and
haven't been back to the Stanley Cup finals since those early
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the 33-year history of the team, there have been a lot of
disappointments,'' fan Phil Downen said. ''But I think they're the
best I've ever seen. They're well-rounded, they've got depth on the
bench and, of course, the coaching can't be overlooked.''
</P>
<P>
   Brent Bollmeier, who has been a season ticket-holder for 10
years, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a hockey nut, and I would watch them even if they didn't
win,'' he said. ''I don't want to jinx anything, but I really think
this is their year.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Cardinals, Bollmeier said he was taking a
wait-and-see approach.
</P>
<P>
   ''They look really good right now, but it's still early in the
season,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Strode also cautions that while St. Louis often gets credit for
having some of the best sports fans in the nation, they are not
above turning on their teams.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the Cardinals were 1-and-6, people would be calling for
Tony La Russa to be fired,'' he said. ''And people won't think it
was a successful year if the Blues don't make it past the second
round again.''

   NEW YORK (AP) -- One man is dead and another was injured
following a shootout Wednesday with an off-duty police officer who
was moonlighting as a security guard at a downtown Brooklyn
clothing store, police officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen or more shots were fired, but it was not known how many
were fired by the officer or who had fired first. At least one of
the two suspects had a weapon, said Assistant Chief Joseph
Esposito, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred at 5:48 p.m. at the Jimmy Jazz clothing
store at Hanover Place and Fulton Street, Esposito said. The
store's alarm sounded when the two suspects entered the store,
causing the officer to respond, thinking it may have been a
possible shoplifting incident, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, who was not immediately identified, confronted the
suspects, words were exchanged, and a fight ensued. At least one of
the suspects produced a weapon and gunfire was exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The officer apparently shot one suspect in the chest. The
suspect -- identified as Malcolm Burno, 17, of Brooklyn -- was
pronounced dead at Brooklyn Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The other suspect, who was not immediately identified, was shot
in the leg and fled into a dark-colored car, apparently after
picking up the dead suspect's gun. He was later apprehended at
Bellevue Hospital, where he had checked himself in, Esposito said.
</P>
<P>
   A store employee, standing in back of the store, was shot in the
leg and taken to St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan, where he was
in stable condition. It was not immediately clear who shot him. The
police officer, who was given permission from department officials
to work at the store, sustained several facial injuries, Esposito
said. The 29-year-old officer is assigned to the 71st Precinct in
Flatbush, Brooklyn. He does not have any prior police shootings and
has a clean record.
</P>
<P>
   A high-ranking police source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said police were investigating whether the suspects were
part of a gang that sets off alarms upon entering stores. The scam
works like this, the source said: when the alarm goes off, store
employees see that the suspects have no merchandise. After
shoplifting, the suspects leave the store, setting off the alarm
again, but the store employees, believing the alarm is going off
erroneously, let the suspects leave.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, a man opened fire outside the Jimmy Jazz store,
wounding eight people.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's incident was the latest shooting involving police
officers. The shootings have sparked a public outcry in the city
and led to intense scrutiny of police practices. The U.S. Civil
Rights Commission is considering whether to recommend an
independent federal monitor to oversee the NYPD.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, four white undercover officers shot unarmed West
African immigrant Amadou Diallo on his Bronx doorstep, prompting a
month of daily protests outside police headquarters in which more
than 1,200 people were arrested, including elected officials and
celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   The acquittal of those officers in February by an Albany jury
angered many who said it sent the wrong message to police. Shortly
after that verdict, another unarmed black man, Patrick Dorismond,
was fatally shot in a botched drug sting in midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The officer and both suspects in Wednesday's shooting are black.
</P>
<P>
   Many criticized Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's statements in the wake
of the Dorismond shooting. He did not express sympathy to
Dorismond's family and he and Police Commissioner Howard Safir
released the dead man's criminal record -- including a sealed
juvenile record -- as they defended the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Those actions appeared to have an impact on Giuliani's public
support, giving his U.S. Senate opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, a
boost in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Anger bubbled over into violence between civilians and officers
outside Dorismond's funeral.
