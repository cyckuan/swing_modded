<HEADLINE> Iraqi Port Receives Largest Ship Since Establishment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BGHDAD, February 6 (Xinhua) -- A cargo ship carrying 54,800 tons
of wheat purchased under the U.N. oil-for-food program entered the
Um Qasr port in southern Iraq on Sunday, the Iraqi News Agency
(INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that such a large vessel has ever entered
the port since its establishment, Iraqi Minister of Transport and
Communications Ahmad Murtadha Khalil was quoted by INA as saying.
</P>
<P>
"This can be taken as a proof that Um Qasr port is in good
conditions for receiving large cargo ships," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iraqi port staffs managed to secure the docking of
the ship in spite of the U.N. embargo and continuous withholding of
Iraqi contracts by the U.S. and British envoys at the U.N.
Sanctions Committee for purchasing naval drillers and other
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The Basra and Um Qasr ports in southern Iraq are the country's
only outlets to the Persian Gulf, through which Iraq exports most
of its oil to the world markets.
</P>
<P>
Humanitarian supplies bought under the oil-for-food program will
also have to be shipped to these ports first and then transported
to other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Under the humanitarian deal now in its seventh phase, Iraq is
allowed to sell limited amount of oil in every six months to buy
food, medicine and other necessities for its people reeling under
the decade-old sanctions imposed on the country following its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> UAE Opens Oil Spill Training Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Senior managers from Gulf oil
companies are being trained in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to
deal with unexpected oil spills, the official WAM news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The four-day training program, organized by the Gulf Area Oil
Companies Mutual Aid Organization (GAOCMAO) in coordination with
Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), opened here on Sunday, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
The training course is intended to familiarize senior managers
of major Gulf oil companies on various problems encountered during
an oil spill, said Moayed Yousif Al Bassam, chairman of the Abu
Dhabi-based organization.
</P>
<P>
"A rapid decisive response will save the economy and the
environment and senior managers play a central role, as they have
overall command of the operational aspects of the spill response,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The course will give participants an overview of causes and
effects of oil spills as well as measures to be taken to prevent
such crises.
</P>
<P>
The managers will also learn about response techniques, their
limitations and schemes for compensation for all pollution damages,
Bassam said.
</P>
<P>
In view of the recent oil spill by the Al Jaziya tanker off Abu
Dhabi, ADNOC has arranged a visit to the sites for participants in
order to assess the actual impact of an oil spill.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated tanker sank in bad weather last month, causing the
leakage of more than 300 tons of heavy oil.
</P>
<P>
Abu Dhabi authorities have taken measures to stop the spill and
clean up the beaches affected by the oil slick. But efforts are
still continuing to pump the hundreds of tons of remaining oil from
the sunken ship into another vessel, which is rather difficult
because of rough weather.
</P>
<P>
The course is of great relevance, as Abu Dhabi is currently
experiencing an oil spill, said Captain A.M. Gabal, director of oil
terminals of ADNOC.
</P>
<P>
The UAE is heavily dependent on use of tankers to transport
crude oil, gas and other products, and the magnitude of tanker
traffic is set to grow in the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that tanker movements are particularly vulnerable to
tanker generated oil spills and pollution accidents.

<P>
MOSCOW, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Boeing-727 passenger
plane, hijacked by unidentified gunmen earlier Sunday, is heading
for the Russian capital of Moscow after entering Russia's air
space Sunday evening following its flight from Aktyubinsk, a
regional center in western Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
A reliable source at Russian force structures said that at 9 p.
m. Moscow time (1800 GMT), the plane was over the vicinity of
Penza, heading toward Moscow, being tracked down by Russian
operational anti-aircraft defense monitors.
</P>
<P>
The source added that by 9 p.m. Moscow time, the hijackers did
not reveal their demands or destination.
</P>
<P>
According to the source, flight time from Penza to Moscow is 60
minutes straight, 80-90 minutes "by echelon."

MOSCOW, February 6 (Xinhua) -- A hijacked Afghan airliner
landed in the Sheremetevo-1 airport here Sunday night with 131
passengers and nine crew members aboard.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency quoted intelligence sources as saying
that the passenger plane will fly on to London after refueling in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing-727 landed at 21:41 local time (1841 GMT) after
being given food and fuel at the Aktyubinsk airport in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
Agents of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), the main
successor to the KGB, are at the airport, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
Hijackers of the passenger plane are demanding the release of
the former governor of an Afghan province held by the ruling
Taliban, the independent Afghan Islamic Press said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The plane, which was flying a domestic flight from the capital
Kabul to the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif, was diverted to
Tashkent, Uzbekistan, for refueling.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers, numbering at probably nine, have demanded that
the plane be refueled and that 181 portions of food be provided,
Tass said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Report on EU Envoy Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Sunday denied a press
report that the European Union (EU) special envoy Miguel Moratinos
is scheduled to visit Tehran to discuss the Middle East peace
process with Iranian officials.
</P>
<P>
"There is no plan on a visit by Moratinos to Iran," Foreign
Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said, quoted by the Islamic
Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Some western sources have speculated that the EU envoy would ask
Iran to end its support for the Muslim Militant group Hezbollah, or
Party of God, which has been fighting Israeli forces in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Iran has strongly opposed the Middle East peace process and any
compromise with Israel, calling for military struggle to root out
the Israeli regime.
</P>
<P>
After breaking ties with Tel Aviv following the 1979 Islamic
revolution, Tehran refused to recognize the Jewish state, calling
it "the usurper of Islamic lands."
</P>
<P>
However, the moderate Iranian government has softened its
attitude towards the peace process by claiming that Iran would not
take any action to undermine the peace process, though it is
against it.

<HEADLINE> Barak Vows to Repulse Hezbollah Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak said here Sunday that his country would fight back
against attacks launched by Hezbollah, or Party of God, guerrillas
from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference with his Jordanian
counterpart Abdel Rauf Rawabdeh, Barak denied that Israel is
following a policy of tolerating Hezbollah attacks to keep alive
the fragile peace process with Syria, a major power broker in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He made the pledge after one Israeli soldier was reportedly
killed and six others injured earlier in the day in a bomb attack
by Hezbollah guerrillas in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
However, Barak reiterated his commitment to withdrawing Israeli
troops from south Lebanon, where the soldiers are patrolling a
security zone Israel set up 1985 with the declared aim to protect
its northern borders from guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah has been spearheading a resistance
movement against Israeli occupation in south Lebanon, and it often
launched artillery and rocket attacks on Israeli targets in the
past years.
</P>
<P>
The press conference was held after a summit meeting between
Barak and Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein on the obstacles
facing the peace talks between Israel, Syria and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Barak's visit to Amman was part of his consultations with Arab
leaders after Israeli-Syrian peace talks were deadlocked again last
week. Syria demanded a written commitment from Israel to hand back
in full the Golan Heights, which it captured from Syria in the 1967
Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Sharp disagreements also occurred between Israel and the
Palestinians over which areas should be targeted for a 6.1 percent
third-phase withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians had vowed to set up an independent state no
later than September, regardless of result of their peace talks
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been a major peace broker in the region after it
signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, the second Arab country
after Egypt to strike a peace deal with the Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> Israeli PM Visits Jordan on Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
arrived here Sunday afternoon to meet King Abdullah Bin Hussein on
bilateral ties and developments of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
High on the agenda of the ongoing summit were obstacles facing
the peace talks between Israel, Syria and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Barak`s visit to Amman comes at a time when Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators are holding intense talks to meet a
February 13 deadline to lay down a framework for a final peace
accord by September.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Barak`s arrival in Amman, Abdullah called on the
Israeli leadership to manifest courage in pushing forward its peace
talks with Arab neighbors despite complexity and difficulties in
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The monarch, who had been a major peace broker in the region,
also pledged that he would try to help resume the peace talks
between Israel and Syria and to create an positive atmosphere
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Syrian-Israeli peace talks resumed in Washington last November
after a 45-month break, but the talks broke down again after Syria
demanded Israel submit a written commitment to hand back in full
the Golan Heights it captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East
war.
</P>
<P>
On the Palestinian track, Israel has agreed to withdraw its
troops from another 6.1 percent of the West Bank, but refused to
discuss maps of the areas targeted for the redeployment with
Palestinian negotiators.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians announced they would set up an independent
state no later than September regardless of the results of the
peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been trying to bridge differences between Israel and
Arab countries since it signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994,
the second Arab country after Egypt to strike a peace deal with the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Jordan took peace as its strategic option in dealing with
regional affairs, and said it supported all efforts by all parties
which could lead to a just, durable and comprehensive peace in the
region, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Keen on Economic Cooperation with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkish State Minister Hasan
Gemici said on Sunday that Turkey and Israel are "working to turn
their strategic relations into an economic partnership," reported
the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Gemici made the comment in Istanbul before departure for Israel
to attend a meeting of the Joint Economic Commission (JEC), where
the Turko-Israeli relations will be evaluated in every field and
the two sides will seek new ways to further their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Turkish fashion show will be held in Tel Aviv.
Gemici and Transportation Minister Enis Oksuz, leading a total of
300 Turks, will participate in the two occasions.
</P>
<P>
Three major issues - prospect of Israel's purchase of Manavgat
water, Israeli participation in Turkey's South East Development
Project (GAP) and formation of a free-trade zone - are expected to
be taken up for discussion during the JEC meeting scheduled in
Jerusalem on February 7-9.
</P>
<P>
New cooperation opportunities will also be explored in the
fields of transportation, energy, health, culture,
telecommunications and education.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum of understanding will be signed by Gemici and
Israeli Minister of Industry and Trade Ran Cohen at the end of the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Israel, which has experienced a serious water shortage in recent
years, accepted in principle Turkey's proposal to sell water of the
Manavgat River, south Turkey, during President Suleyman Demirel's
visit to Israel last July.
</P>
<P>
However, it was reported, a feasibility study report prepared by
an Israeli delegation which visited Turkey has not yet been
discussed by the Israeli cabinet which was supposed to give the
final decision on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a statement that water purchase
by Israel from Turkey would have great contribution to the
relations between the two countries and also remove Turkey's
worries over a possible Israeli-Syrian peace deal, according to a
report from Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel has shown a great interest in Turkey's ambitious GAP
since the very beginning and wants to take part in its irrigation
and energy projects.
</P>
<P>
As for Turkey, it is eager to set up a free-trade zone between
the two countries. Israel maintains a positive approach to the
matter, but it is reportedly up to the U.S. to decide.
</P>
<P>
"Turkish Fashion 2000 Fair" will be held in Tel Aviv. Some 250
Turkish firms will participate. Most of the clothes that will be
displayed are made of leather.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti and French troops
are to conduct joint military exercises here on February 11-21, a
Kuwaiti Army official announced on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 10-day war games, dubbed the "West Pearl", will involve air,
ground and naval forces from both armies, said Colonel Ahmad Al-
Rahmani, head of the Public Relations and Moral Guidance Department
of the Kuwaiti Army, in a statement to Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti naval vessels and F-18 warplanes will also take part in
the drill, which Al-Rahmani said is part of the 1992 Kuwaiti-French
Defense Cooperation Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The official said the maneuvers are aimed at enhancing the
fighting ability of the Kuwaiti soldiers and exchanging expertise
with their French counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The French troops are scheduled to arrive here on February 11.
They are presently holding joint exercises with the troops of the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) in the desert.
</P>
<P>
Part of the French forces are scheduled to move on to Oman and
Qatar to hold smaller joint war games during February 12-17.

<HEADLINE> Infection Rate of Malignant Tumors Increases in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The infection rate of malignant
tumors among Iraqi civilians has increased due to the 1991 Gulf
War, said an Iraqi medical source specializing in nuclear medicine
and radio therapy.
</P>
<P>
Director-general of Radio Therapy and Nuclear Medicine Hospital
Taha Hamid al-Askari was quoted on Sunday by the Iraqi News Agency
as saying that Iraqi malignant tumors patients are suffering due to
severe lack of necessary medicine.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not give any figure concerning the number of the
patients.
</P>
<P>
Askari said those patients were exposed to radiation, depleted
uranium (DU) and toxic gases used by the U.S. and British forces
during the 1991 Gulf War, touched off by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. and British representatives at the U.N. Sanctions
Committee have hindered approval of contracts to deliver medicine
and equipment to Iraq according to the oil-for-food program," said
Askari.
</P>
<P>
He added that the U.S. and British representatives presented "
flimsy pretexts far from the facts, which led to the deterioration
of the state of those patients."
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Iraqi Health Minister Omed Medhat
Mubarak has also held the U.S. and British delegates at the
Sanctions Committee responsible for delaying the delivery of
medicine and medical requisites into Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the U.S. and British delegates recently
put on hold three contracts for the purchases of refrigerators for
storing medicine and blood as well as equipment for standard
quality control for laboratory.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq concluded those contracts under the fourth and
fifth phases of the oil-for-food program. The program, now in its
seventh phase, allows Iraq to export limited amount of oil to buy
food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies for its people.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that 300-400 tons of DU shells were used in the
area between Iraq's southern province of Basra and Kuwait during
the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
DU shells are highly toxic, radioactive weapons that cause death
either through direct exposure, inhalation or ingestion.
</P>
<P>
According to a study conducted by a team of Iraqi experts since
1997 and till now, DU weapons have caused a high pollution rate of
the soil and ground water 10 times more than the normal level.

confidence to ensure progress in their ongoing peace talks.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal while meeting with visiting Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak who arrived here earlier in the day for talks
on bilateral ties and developments of the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah stressed that Jordan believes that the Palestinian
issue is the core element to achieve a just, durable and
comprehensive peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The monarch underlined that the legitimate rights of the
Palestinians must be restored, including the establishment of an
independent state on their own soil.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Barak briefed the Jordanian ruler on obstacles
facing Israel's peace talks with Syria and the Palestinians and his
country's efforts to overcome those difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Barak's visit came as Israeli and Palestinian negotiators were
holding intense talks to meet a self-imposed February 13 deadline
to lay down a framework for a final peace scheduled for September.
</P>
<P>
Israel has agreed to withdraw its troops from another 6.1
percent of the West Bank in a third-phase redeployment, but refused
to discuss with Palestinian negotiators maps of the areas targeted
for
the delayed redeployment, originally slated for January 20.
</P>
<P>
Before Barak arrived in Amman, Abdullah called on the Israeli
leadership to manifest courage in pushing forward its peace talks
with Arab neighbors despite complexity and difficulties in the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The monarch, who had been a major peace broker in the region,
also vowed to try to help revitalize the peace talks between Israel
and Syria by creating a positive atmosphere for the talks which
were suspended indefinitely last month.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that a peace treaty must be reached between Syria
and Israel to contribute to peace making in the region.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel resumed their peace talks in the U.S. last
December after a 45-month break, but the talks broke down again
after two rounds. Syria demanded Israel submit a written commitment
to handing back in full the Golan Heights it captured from Syria in
the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been trying to bridge differences between Israel and
Arab countries since it signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Amman has reiterated on many occasions that Jordan takes peace
as its strategic option in dealing with regional affairs, and it
supports all efforts by all parties to bring about a just, durable
and comprehensive peace in the region.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Civil Defense Authorities Prepared for Pilgrimage Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Saudi civil defense
authorities have completed safety preparations for the upcoming
Hajj season due to begin in mid-March, said reports reaching here
from Saudi Arabia Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Saudi General Manager of Civil Defense Mohammad Al-Suhaili said
the tents area in Mina, one of the two holy sites in the Gulf
kingdom, was attached special importance during the preparations
and put into intensive scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
Fireproof tents have been erected, and foam dispensers and fire
vehicles also deployed in potentially crowded and dangerous areas,
Al-Suhaili said.
</P>
<P>
A tent fire gutted 70,000 tents in Mina in 1997, killing more
than 350 pilgrims and injured 1,600 others.
</P>
<P>
It was said that a total of 2.4 billion Saudi riyals (640
million U.S. dollars) were spent this year in setting up the 40,000
fireproof tents, which are able to accommodate over 2 million
pilgrims.  Some 2 million Saudi and foreign pilgrims
performed Hajj rituals in Mecca and Mina in 1999. The number of
pilgrims this year were also expected to reach the same level of
last year.
</P>
<P>
In addition to anti-fire arrangements, the Saudi civil defense
authorities also mapped out a comprehensive plan to open up secure
routes for pilgrims, which will be monitored by helicopters.

MOSCOW, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The terrorists, who captured the

At present, the plane, which landed at the Aktyubinsk airport

The Boeing 727 had previously been diverted from a domestic
flight to Tashkent, Uzbekistan. It then took off from Tashkent and
was reportedly landed at Aktyubinsk airport Sunday evening.

<HEADLINE> Sovereignists Postpone Quebec Referendum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Parti Quebecois has for the
first time evoked the possibility of calling a referendum of
sovereignty from Ottawa in at least three years.
</P>
<P>
Premier Lucien Bouchard of Canada's French speaking province
told a weekend party conference opened in Montreal Saturday that
the postponement was "just because Quebecers are not ready today
for a referendum on sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
He told more than 400 delegates at the start of the two-day
national council meeting that "we have to work for our re-election
because we will never achieve sovereignty in opposition."
</P>
<P>
The Parti Quebecois, re-elected in November 1998, has until
2003 to call the next election.
</P>
<P>
The formal referendum postponement came as an opinion poll
showed last month that only 38 percent were ready to vote Yes to
the same sovereignty question posed in the last referendum held in
October 1995.

<HEADLINE> UK Retail Prices Fall In January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Prices on the High Street in
Britain fell in January for the ninth month in a row, according to
the latest figures released by the British Retail Consortium (BRC).
</P>
<P>
The BRC's shop price index showed that prices on a commonly
bought range of goods were 1.2 percent lower than in January last
year and 0.8 percent lower than two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The index is based on prices of 200 of the most commonly bought
items in shops taken from five large urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The index is now at its lowest level since records began in
November 1997. Canny shoppers are forcing shops to curb their
prices, keeping inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen in the retail sector say the trend is hurting
retailer's profits, even though the volume of sales increased this
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
The BRC said January's price fall reflected discounting in New
Year clearance sales and reductions in the food and drink sector.

<P>
LONDON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Commercial car registrations
grew in January, defying expectations of a minor slowdown in the
market, according to the latest figures released by the Society of
Motor Manufacturers and Traders.
</P>
<P>
More than 1850,000 new cars were registered in January, a 1.8
percent increase on the 1999 figure. But while company car sales
were healthy, the number of private buyers was down by more than
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is the fourth successive month there has been a fall in the
sector. The motor industry has been struggling since last year
because of the controversy over car pricing.
</P>
<P>
The Competition Commission has been investigating why UK prices
are higher than those in other parts of Europe. Its report was
submitted to the government last week and will be made public in a
few weeks' time.
</P>
<P>
It is believed car buyers have been holding off from making
purchases until the report comes out, and dealers have suffered.

<HEADLINE> (Urgent) Mexican Police Occupies University Campus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 6 (Xinhua ) -- Mexican Interior Minister
Diodoro Carrasco and Attorney General Jorge Madrazo Cuellar said
Sunday morning at a press conference that the authorities have
retaken the main campus of the largest university in the Western
Hemisphere occupied by strikers for nearly 10 months.
</P>
<P>
Carrasco said the strikers still refused to end the occupation
after the tolerance of the government and the insisting call for
ending the strike by the new dean of the National Autonomous
University of Mexico (UNAM), Jose Ramon de la Fuente.
</P>
<P>
The attorney general said that the operation started after
receiving reports of plundering, riot, injuries and damage of
properties of national heritage.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Mexican police raided the campus of the 268,0000-
student UNAM from about 6:30 local time Sunday, tearing down
barriers and arresting some 400 strikers.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to negotiate an end to the strike, directed by a small
core of radical students, had repeatedly failed. But officials
were reluctant to take the campus by force because of fears of
violence.
</P>
<P>
The strike began in April of 1999 with students opposed to
plans to raise tuition, which had been just a few cents, to the
equivalent of 140 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The university backed off those plans, but strikers refused to
end their occupation of the campus, pressing a six-point agenda to
reverse academic changes and give students more power.
</P>
<P>
A referendum two weeks ago indicated nearly 90 percent of
students, faculty and university employees approved of the dean's
proposal to meet most of the strikers' demands and end the strike
immediately.
</P>
<P>
However, the strike leaders have hardened their position. The
strike has been marked by sometimes-violent demonstrations which
tied up Mexico City's main streets. Clashes occurred between
students for and against the strike.
</P>
<P>
Some of the worst violence occurred Tuesday when anti-strike
students, backed up by university security forces, took control of
a university-affiliated high school. Strikers returned later in
the day and retook the school, injuring 37 security guards. Police
then raided the school, arresting 250 strikers.

<HEADLINE> At Least 8 Terrorists Aboard Hijacked Afghan Plane: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 6 (Xinhua) -- There are at least eight
terrorists aboard the Afghan Boeing-727 passenger jet, hijacked
Sunday by unidentified gunmen, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
"They, not fewer than eight, are armed with pistols," Interfax
quoted one of the 10 airliner passengers, released during its stop-
over at the Uzbek capital of Tashkent's airport Sunday evening, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Now, the hijacked plane has left the airport of Aktyubinsk, a
regional center in western Kazakhstan, said sources at Kazakh
force structures, cited by Interfax-Kazakhstan. Ahead of takeoff,
the crew asked ground services about weather conditions in Moscow,
St.Petersburg, and Kiev.
</P>
<P>
According to sources, the plane was given technical assistance
in Aktyubinsk. The source of fuel leakage was eliminated, and
meals were brought on board.
</P>
<P>
It was earlier reported that the hijackers intended to announce
their demands and further destination only after leaving the
Aktyubinsk airport.

terrorists earlier Sunday, entered Russia's air space Sunday
evening after its flight from Aktyubinsk, a regional center in
western Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
Russian force structures said that at 8:20 p.m. Moscow time (
1720 GMT), the plane was over Samara, heading toward Moscow, being
tracked down by operational anti-aircraft defense monitors.
</P>
<P>
The source added that by 8:30 p.m. Moscow time (1730 GMT), the
hijackers had revealed neither their demands or destination.

Earlier, In Moscow, officers from the Alpha special unit of the
Russian Federal Security Service's Anti-Terrorist Center were
summoned to the unit's headquarters at the Nabat or Alarm call
Sunday, said Russian law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
The source said the most likely reason for putting the unit on
high alert is a possible landing of the hijacked Afghan plane at
one of Moscow's aerodromes.
</P>
<P>
The source presumed the jet may land either at Sheremetyevo
aerodromes.
</P>
<P>
It may also land at Domodedovo or at a special military airport
at Chkalovsk outside Moscow, where, according to the source, the
landing strip is being prepared.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Launches Action Plan to Clear Alien Vegetation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government Sunday launched a four-year action plan to rid the Cape
Peninsula of invading alien vegetation, the South African Press
Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The plan, named "Ukuvuka -- Operation Fire Stop", was launched
in Cape Town by Water Affairs and Forestry Minister Ronnie Kasrils
and Tourism and Environmental Affairs Minister Valli Moosa in an
effort to remove a major fire threat posed by alien vegetation.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a devastating fire swept through 9,000 hectares of
the Cape Peninsula, destroying homes and properties in both luxury
suburbs and informal settlements.
</P>
<P>
The action plan will receive donations from Santam Insurance
Company, which has pledged 20 million rand (3.3 million U.S.
dollars) over the four years, and Independent Newspapers Cape,
which is making a contribution of 5. 4 million rand (900,000 U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Up to 50 million rand (8.3 million U.S. dollars) or more will
be contributed by the International Global Environmental Facility
(GES), the report said.
</P>
<P>
Other sponsors and funding initiatives, including contributions
from private land owners who would in turn receive assistance to
clear invading alien vegetation from their properties, could push
the plan's total funding to as much as 130 million rand (21.6
million U.S. dollars) in the initial four-year period.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, which is being supported by politicians and
decision makers across the political spectrum and from all levels
of government, invading alien vegetation will be cleared from both
public and private land along the entire Peninsula Mountain chain
-- from Cape Point to Table Mountain.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Fails to Realize GDP Target: Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe might fail to realize
its 216 billion-Zimbabwean dollar (5.68 billion-U.S. dollar)
target for Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the year 1999, a
merchant bank of the country has said.
</P>
<P>
In its latest bulletin released here on Sunday, the First
Merchant Bank said it is not likely that the GDP would grow by at
least 1.2 percent during the year under review because of the
declines experienced in key sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
There is a possibility that the country could actually register
a negative growth for 1999, the bank predicted.
</P>
<P>
It said: "The modest growth recorded for agriculture and some
of the service sectors now appear unlikely to exceed or even match
the estimated declines in manufacturing, mining, transport and
construction."
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing index for the first 10 months of 1999 was
105.98 compared to 114.69 of the same period the previous year,
the bank said, attributing the decline to unstable macro-economic
fundamentals.

<HEADLINE> 1 Israeli Soldier Killed, 6 Injured in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 6 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli soldier was killed and
six others wounded on Sunday in a bomb explosion near their vehicle
in south Lebanon, security sources said.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued in Beirut by the military guerrilla group
Hezbollah, or Party of God, said its fighters detonated a bomb near
a group of nine soldiers driving on the road to an army post at
Blat in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The bomb wounded seven soldiers who were flown to Israel for
medical treatment, and one died.
</P>
<P>
The bomb attack has raised Israeli casualties in south Lebanon
this year to five dead and 14 wounded. Hezbollah reported the death
of a fighter on Sunday, raising to five the number of guerrillas
killed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli warplanes mounted an air raid on suspected
guerrilla positions in Zibquine and the Botom hills which face
Blat, by launching at least four air-to-surface missiles. The
Israeli army has confirmed the air attack. However, there were no
immediate reports of casualties.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah also bombarded posts of the Israeli army and their
ally South Lebanon Army (SLA) with mortars, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The escalation of violence in south Lebanon coincides with a
suspension of peace talks between Israel and Syria, the power
broker of Lebanon. Israel has blamed the escalation on Syria, but
Damascus denied having any influence over Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah has been spearheading a resistance
movement to oust Israeli forces and the SLA from south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Israeli PM Visits Jordan on Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
arrived here Sunday afternoon to meet King Abdullah Bin Hussein on
bilateral ties and developments of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
High on the agenda of the ongoing summit were obstacles facing
the peace talks between Israel, Syria and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Barak`s visit to Amman comes at a time when Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators are holding intense talks to meet a
February 13 deadline to lay down a framework for a final peace
accord by September.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Barak`s arrival in Amman, Abdullah called on the
Israeli leadership to manifest courage in pushing forward its peace
talks with Arab neighbors despite complexity and difficulties in
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The monarch, who had been a major peace broker in the region,
also pledged that he would try to help resume the peace talks
between Israel and Syria and to create an positive atmosphere
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Syrian-Israeli peace talks resumed in Washington last September
after a 45-month break, but the talks broke down again after Syria
demanded Israel submit a written commitment to hand back in full
the Golan Heights it captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East
war.
</P>
<P>
On the Palestinian track, Israel has agreed to withdraw its
troops from another 6.1 percent of the West Bank, but refused to
discuss maps of the areas targeted for the redeployment with
Palestinian negotiators.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians announced they would set up an independent
state no later than September regardless of the results of the
peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been trying to bridge differences between Israel and
Arab countries since it signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994,
the second Arab country after Egypt to strike a peace deal with the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Jordan took peace as its strategic option in dealing with

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Is "No Tearing Hurry" to Sign CTBT, FM Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government "is
no tearing hurry" to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT),
Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar in an exclusive interview with the
Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Sattar said that Pakistan is a declared nuclear weapon state
and signing the CTBT will not alter its status.
</P>
<P>
He clarified that even if Pakistan signs the treaty, it will
not forgo its right to conduct further tests, if India conducted
further tests.
</P>
<P>
"Whether Pakistan and India become parties to the CTBT or not,
that will not affect the nuclear status of either country or their
right to maintain and even develop their nuclear arsenals," said
the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the on-going debate on the signing of the CTBT
is to promote better understanding of what this treaty is and what
it is not, Sattar said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Pakistan has to open its nuclear plants to foreign
inspection if it signs the CTBT, he said, "Not at all. There is no
such provision in the treaty."
</P>
<P>
Sattar said in 1996 Pakistan voted in favor of the treaty. In
September 1998, the then Pakistani prime minister announced in the
U.N. General Assembly that Pakistan would sign the treaty if
sanctions against Pakistan were lifted.
</P>
<P>
"Let me state that maintenance of credible nuclear deterrence
capability is indispensable for Pakistan's security. Pakistan
continues to pursue the nuclear option with determination and no
pressures and sanctions have been allowed to deter us from that
path," said the foreign minister.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Calls on Oversea Iranians to Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 6 (Xinhua) -- President Mohammad Khatami on
Sunday called on millions of oversea Iranians to return to serve
their hometown, saying the government welcomes their talents and
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session of the Kharazmi International
Festival, Khatami said Iran opens its arms to all those who have
shared privileges of life with the Iranian nation and have reached
the status that can serve their homeland.
</P>
<P>
The Kharazmi International Festival is the country's most
important festival for science and technology, usually held during
the "10-day Dawn" celebrating the victory of 1979 Islamic
revolution. Terming oversea Iranians as "invaluable assets," he
expressed hope that in future Iran would witness their expanded
presence in the country, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
After the 1979 Islamic revolution, several million Iranians,
including intellectuals and well-educated workers, fled to western
countries, mainly the United States and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials have urged oversea Iranians to serve their
homeland and put their investments in Iran's economic development
programs.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to hundreds of Iranian and foreign scholars, Khatami
also underlined that Iran cannot keep its door closed to science
and technology. He expressed regret over Iran's reliance on oil
revenues, adding that Iran should be equipped with modern science
and technology, which he termed as pillars of the independence and
security of a country.

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns MKO for Terrorist Explosions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi on Sunday strongly condemned the
military opposition Mujahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) for
launching terrorist attacks on government buildings in downtown
Tehran Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
"The MKO's indulging in blind terrorist acts against defenseless
people is a proof of the organization's terrorist and anti-people
nature and that it has reached the dead end," Asefi was quoted by
the Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
At least one person was killed and five others injured in a
series of explosions in the southern Vali Asr street, a police
commander told the state-run television on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Two of the injured have been discharged after medical services
but three others remained hospitalized, the unnamed commander said.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers on Sunday reported that five to seven mortars were
fired into an area close to the government buildings, including the
office of the supreme leader, the presidential office and the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, Iranian authorities have not confirmed the report.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman called on the world community to seriously deal
with MKO as the agent behind explosions in Tehran in order to carry
out their international responsibility and undertaking in their
campaign against the ominous phenomenon of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
A "serious, decisive and non-selective approach" should be taken
by the international community and the world countries,
particularly those claiming to be fighting terrorism, towards this
vicious phenomenon, he said.
</P>
<P>
The explosions occurred when rival political factions were
engaged in white-hot campaigns ahead of the sensitive parliamentary
elections on February 18, which could shape a new balance of power.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq-based MKO has claimed responsibility for the blasts. It
had been an active political and military group fighting against
former shah's regime, but was declared illegal in 1981 following
sharp wranglings with the ruling clergy.
</P>
<P>
During the past decades, MKO launched series of attacks on
Iranian interests inside and outside the country. Iran responded
with air raids on MKO bases near Baghdad.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Israel Tries to Evade Implementing Signed Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Leader Yasser Arafat
said that it has become obvious that Israel tries to shirk its
obligations under the agreements signed by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Provisions of the agreements have not so far been accurately and
honestly implemented, particularly with regard to Jewish
settlements, said Arafat after meeting with Arab League Secretary
General Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Arafat said, he briefed the AL chief on the
latest developments of Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government under Prime Minister Ehud Barak approved
the building of 4,128 housing units for Jewish settlers, mostly in
Jerusalem and Bethlehem, he said. They are more than those built
under the previous government led by Barak's hardline predecessor
Benjamin Netanyahu, he added.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of Jewish settlements in West Bank and Gaza has
been viewed by the Palestinians as Israel's efforts aimed at
changing the geographical and demographical status of the holy city
of Jerusalem, which both Israel and the Palestinians claim to be
their capital.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have been demanding that Israel stop building
new settlements in the occupied territories, because disputes over
the settlement issue have in the past repeatedly triggered
suspension of peace talks between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Jewish settlement is one of the thorny issues to be dealt with
in the final status talks launched in November. Under the Sharm el
Sheikh memorandum signed in September, the two sides should work
out a framework agreement by February 13, with an accord on
permanent peace expected for September.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has been a frequent visitor to Cairo to drum up Arab
support. Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace deal with
Israel in 1979, has been a key mediator in peace negotiations
between the Jewish state and other Arab countries.

DHAKA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The advisory committee on Air
Quality Management Project Sunday called for early execution of
the 29-crore taka (about 5.6 million U.S. dollars) program to help
curb air pollution in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Presided over by Environment Secretary Marghub Murshed, the
committee recommended ban on diesel-driven four-stroke engines in
the country at its meeting, while making emission certificates of
the manufacturers mandatory for imported vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The committee emphasized the need for creating massive
awareness through concerted campaign against environment-
unfriendly vehicles and the improvement of the pollution-related
policies.
</P>
<P>
It is also necessary to import fewer environment-unfriendly
vehicles and more environment-friendly ones to curb the emission
of pollutants, the committee said.

<HEADLINE> London Ambulance Pays Dearly for Late Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 6 (Xinhua) - A London woman, who was left
brain damaged after an ambulance took 36 minutes to travel the six
miles to her home, is to get 360,000 pounds (about 573,000 U.S.
dollars) for damages.
</P>
<P>
The London Ambulance Service (LAS) failed to reverse a High
Court ruling against it over the case of 35-year-old asthmatic
Tracy Kent, London Metro reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The service had taken the case to the Court of Appeal, arguing
that it did not have a legal duty to respond to 999 emergency
calls on time, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Other emergency services - police and fire - have been found
not to be liable in similar cases. But Lord Woolf, the Master of
the Rolls or head of Britain's Court of Appeal, said that "the
ambulance service was part of the health service".
</P>
<P>
"It is, therefore, appropriate to regard the LAS as providing
services of the category provided by hospitals and not equivalent
to those rendered by the police or the fire service," he added.
</P>
<P>
Woolf gave permission for the case to go to the House of Lords
to test his judgment. But he said Kent should get her damages,
whatever the outcome of the Lords' hearing.

<P>
HAIKOU, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Local villagers got a huge New
Year's surprise when a giant whale swam aground yesterday on a
small island 40 kilometers away from Haikou, the capital of the
southernmost Hainan Province.
</P>
<P>
At around 10:30 am Saturday, the start of the Chinese lunar New
Year, Chen Wenrong, a fisherman in Beigang Village, Qiongshan City,
spotted the beached whale which is about 11 meters long, 1.4
meters tall, and weighs more than 15,000 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
According to Xinhua reporters who arrived at the spot at noon
today, hundreds of villagers had gathered around the whale, and
some were splashing water on the creature whose skin had begun to
bloat and peel.
</P>
<P>
About 50 years ago, a smaller whale washed up on shore in the
village, according to local residents.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shikun, deputy director of the city Aquatic Products
Bureau, rushed to the scene, but he said there is no viable way to
save the mammoth whale.
</P>
<P>
Local people are now digging a channel to get water to the
whale and dousing it with water to keep it alive.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that experts from Hainan University will come to
the spot tomorrow for the rescue efforts.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Cries Out for Part-time Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Smarting from the absence of
migrant workers who have returned home for the New Year's holiday,
Beijing has put out a call for part-time help to take care of
everything from housecleaning to delivering milk.
</P>
<P>
One Beijinger, who is scheduled to work during the week-long
holiday, still hasn't found a cleaning woman after making dozens
phone calls to housekeeping services. A woman who needs someone to
help take care of her ailing mother-in-law was successful only
after telephoning employment agencies for several days.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of migrant laborers has been an inconvenience for
all levels of society in the Chinese capital. More than 100,000
households got a notice the other day from a dairy company saying
no milk would be delivered between February 3-11 because they were
running out of employees who hadn't left the city.
</P>
<P>
One part-time housekeeper in the community of Donghuamen said
that many families have asked for household help to do the extra
cleaning and cooking during the holiday. She used to work for one
or two families, but now has three jobs a day.
</P>
<P>
Though the migrant laborers' exodus has created more job
opportunities for native Beijing residents, most of them decline
the offers, saying the pay is less at holiday time.

<HEADLINE> Israel Calls for Further Action Against Austria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli cabinet Sunday urged
all "enlightened" nations in the world to take action against
Austria since its new government incorporated elements of a neo-
Nazi nature.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet issued the statement after discussing response to
the inclusion of far-right Freedom party and its notorious leader
Joerg Haider in the new ruling coalition in Austria.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet Secretary Yitzhak Herzog said after Sunday morning's
cabinet weekly meeting that Israel will consider further steps
beyond recalling its ambassador from Vienna, but he gave no
details.
</P>
<P>
"This is a dark day for Austrian democracy and a sad day for the
family of free nations.... The government of Israel sees its duty
and role in facing the nations of the world and warning against the
severe phenomenon," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement added, "the historic lesson from the Holocaust
teaches us that such occurrences cannot be accepted under any
justification... They must be stopped and uprooted."
</P>
<P>
Haider, an outspoken xenophobe and a suspicious sympathizer of
the Nazis' rule, drew international attention after the Freedom
Party he led finished second in Austrian parliamentary election
last October.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Austrian President Thomas Klestil approved a
coalition government including the Freedom Party, after Haider
signed a declaration renouncing Austria's Nazi past and affirming
his commitment to European Values of democracy and human rights.
</P>
<P>
The declaration is a bid to ease European Union's concerns,
which had threatened to boycott Austrian representatives in the EU
and avoid holding political meetings on Austrian soil.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Israeli Foreign Ministry announced last Friday the
recall of its ambassador from Vienna, one of the harshest gestures
in the diplomatic arena, shortly after the new Austrian government
was sworn in.
</P>
<P>
"Israel cannot remain silent in the face of the rise of
extremist right-wing parties, in particular in those countries
which played a role in the events that brought about the
eradication of a third of the Jewish people in the Holocaust," the
ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
During the World War Two from 1939 to 1945, the Nazi regime
deliberately carried out a systematic master plan to liquidate the
Jewish community of Europe, in the course of which some 6 million
Jews, including 1.5 million children, were murdered.

<HEADLINE> Prospects of Palestinian-Israeli Talks Gloomy: Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat has termed as "ridiculous" Palestinian-Israeli negotiations
at all levels, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the remarks after the meeting between Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and Arafat, who arrived here earlier in the
day.
</P>
<P>
Things cannot be straightened up this way, Moussa added.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, many questions were raised regarding the
current situation and the credibility of Israel in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary for everybody to know that Israel has obviously
backtracked on the palestinian track, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
There is also a freeze on the Syrian track, he said, adding that
it is an improper situation that must be dealt with and salvaged
immediately.
</P>
<P>
Optimistic statements and rosy remarks on the Middle East peace
process must not be always believed, and pending problems must be
realistically and immediately dealt with, he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked on the Palestinian displaced committee meetings that are
scheduled to be held here later in the day, Moussa sounded a
pessimistic note.
</P>
<P>
"As long as the present situation is so negative, we do not
expect the meetings to come up with a positive outcome, but let's
wait and see," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Israel's position towards the various peace tracks
reflected the real position of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak or
Israeli domestic requirements, Moussa said that Barak is the one
first and foremost responsible for the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
What is important is that the positions expressed by the Israeli
prime minister are positive and stable, he added.
</P>
<P>
On holding an Arab summit, Moussa said it was necessary and
pressing, but unfortunately some reservations still exist.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's visit to Egypt is part of a flurry of diplomatic
activities launched by Israel and the Palestinians to rally support
for their conflicting positions in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
With the February 13 deadline for a framework agreement on a
permanent peace deal drawing near, positions of the two sides on
Israeli troop deployment in the West Bank and the thorny issues in
the final status talks are still far apart.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are undertaking a 10-day marathon negotiation in a
last-ditch effort to meet the mid-February deadline, but the talks
that started last Sunday have got nowhere so far.

<HEADLINE> People in Sydney Watch Year of Dragon Parade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people Sunday
lined the streets of Sydney of the New South Wales state in
southeast Australia to watch a colorful parade of the Chinese year
of dragon.
</P>
<P>
Cool temperatures and light rain did little to dissuade the
estimated crowds of more than 10,000 people turning up to see the
procession - more than double last year's total.
</P>
<P>
Around 1,500 people took part in the parade, led by a 30-meter-
long red and gold dragon which was brought to life by 40
performers.
</P>
<P>
Among the 39 groups taking part in the parade from the Town
Hall to Hay Street were Chinese community groups, a New South
Wales police marching band, Scouts and Girl Guides and a range of
sports clubs.
</P>
<P>
King Fong, chairman of Sydney's Chinese New Year Festival
Committee, said the celebration was an exciting event.
</P>
<P>
"The atmosphere was quite electric," he said, adding "We had a
lot of enthusiasm from the audience and people were lining the
street five or six deep along the route."
</P>
<P>
Fong said a large number of people who turned out to see the
parade were non-Chinese, proving the event's popularity with a
wide cross-section of the community.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of our Australian friends feel they want to be part of
the festival and have the enthusiasm to be part of it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The celebrations are an opportunity for the Chinese community
to be involved and integrated into the mainstream, but also to
maintain our traditions and heritage," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sydney's Chinese new year celebrations have been held in the
city for 30 years and supported by City of Sydney for the last
four years.
</P>
<P>
The festival, now in its second weekend, draws to close with
dragon boat racing at Darling Harbor next Saturday and Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, U.S. Step Up Efforts to Enhance Military Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and the United States
have agreed to contribute seven million U.S. dollars to a joint
program in a bid to enhance the bilateral military cooperation
between the two countries, Sunday Punch newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
However, the agreement did not specify what each country would
be expected to contribute for the program.
</P>
<P>
The action plan was aimed to improve the military relations
between the two countries and to professionalize the Armed Forces
of Nigeria, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement for the implementation of the action plan was
reached in the Nigerian capital Abuja during a recent meeting of
the Nigerian defense officials and their U.S. counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Bernd McConwell, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State for Defense,
said that his government would cooperate with the Nigerian
military in the area of education, technical aid, training
equipment, reactivating the C-130 planes and rehabilitation of
barracks.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Nigeria's contribution to the program would
certainly reduce the amount the U.S. Congress would be requested
to approve, said McConwell.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Defense Minister Theophilus Danjuma expressed
Nigeria's willingness to cooperate with the U.S. government in the
on-going effort to recamp military installations and enhance
professionalism of the Nigerian armed forces.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Pledges to Continue With Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni said here Sunday that his government is determined to
thoroughly implement all the reforms already adopted and pursue
economic development in the new decade.
</P>
<P>
The president made the pledge in his key-note speech at the
celebrations marking the 14th anniversary of the victory of the
ruling National Resistance Movement which took power in the east
African country in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Museveni lauded the government's liberalization economic policy
and stressed the importance of a larger market for the sustainable
development of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The president pledged to make more investment in education,
especially the current Universal Primary Education Program,
research and improvement in infrastructure which he said is the
engine of economic boost.
</P>
<P>
The main challenges facing Uganda are unacceptably high
illiteracy rate, poor infrastructure, corruption and bad
governance, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Without addressing these problems seriously and vigorously, the
country would not achieve remarkable economic development and
would continue to be marginalized in the increasingly competitive
international market.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Museveni urged his countrymen to be optimistic about
the future and develop economy in order to achieve prosperity of
the nation.
</P>
<P>
Ugandans were also encouraged to use raw materials rich in the
country and to strengthen regional economic cooperation with the
establishment of the East African Community.
</P>
<P>
The National Resistance Movement government came to power on
January 26 of 1986, marking the end of instability and the
beginning of a new era for the country.
</P>
<P>
During the past 14 years, Uganda has developed very fast both
economically and socially.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Rebels Urged to Surrender to Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni urged all the rebels fighting against his government to
stop committing atrocities to innocent civilians and come out to
surrender to the government forces.
</P>
<P>
"They should stop their futile efforts to fight the government
because they are doomed to fail," the president said at the
ceremony marking the 14th anniversary of the victory of the ruling
National Resistance Movement here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Rebels operating in northern and western Uganda should take
advantage of the recently passed Amnesty Law and have their sins
forgiven, Museveni said, adding that "they are welcome to come
back to their societies if they give up atrocities."
</P>
<P>
In his live broadcast speech, the president noted that recently
the rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army are coming to surrender
to the government in scores from Gulu and Kitgum districts in the
northern region and they are forgiven.
</P>
<P>
This can be a great temptation to others who are still based in
southern Sudan, he added.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader Joseph Kony is being isolated because his
resorting to terrorism invites hate from every part of the
country, even his own tribe.
</P>
<P>
The government troops are scoring victories in the fronts in
both the Rwenzori mountains in the west and the northern region,
the president told the nation, pointing out that the rebels would
be left no space for manoeuvre.
</P>
<P>
However, Museveni warned that if the rebels continue to fight
the government forces and use terrorism to destabilize the regions
mentioned, his government would not hesitate to finish them off
once and for all.
</P>
<P>
The two rebel groups, respectively based in the eastern part of
the Democratic Republic of the Congo and southern Sudan, have been
causing havoc by killing, maiming and abducting.
</P>
<P>
They entered Uganda late last year and launched a spate of
attacks on both security and soft targets.
</P>
<P>
The National Resistance Movement government came to power on
January 26 of 1986, marking the end of instability and the
beginning of a new era for the country.
</P>
<P>
The celebration was delayed for 10 days due to Museveni's plan
to attend a U.N. Security Council meeting on the DRC in New York.
</P>
<P>
During the past 14 years, Uganda has developed very fast both
economically and socially.

WASHINGTON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Alarmed by the prospect that U.S. President Bill Clinton may
bypass Pakistan when he visits South Asia next month, Pakistan's
chief executive Pervez Musharraf has pledged in a letter to a U.S.
lawmaker that his government will wage an "unequivocal" fight
against terrorism and hold local elections by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
-- Piggybacking on their success in developing drugs for HIV
infection, U.S. researchers are reporting major progress in
combating hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Studies reported in recent
months at medical conferences suggest doctors might soon be able
to eradicate the viruses of the two forms of hepatitis or send
them into sustained remission in a majority of infected people.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton's top foreign policy adviser
Samuel R. Berger says Washington's decision to impose diplomatic
sanctions against Austria is driven partly by a desire to send a
message that the United States will not stand idly by if other
anti-immigrant, far-right parties try to join other coalition
governments in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Lunar New Year Overlaps Beginning of Spring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- This year's Spring Festival was
an especially lucky one in the eyes of Chinese.
</P>
<P>
For one thing, the eve of the lunar New Year fell on the same
day as the solar first day of Spring, which was Friday. Added to
that, the first day of the lunar Year of the Dragon -- the most
auspicious animal in the Chinese 12-year zodiac cycle -- was at
the beginning of the new millennium. And this is just the sixth
lunar New Year's eve to fall on the first day of Spring in more
than 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese lunar New Year is the first day of the year on the
lunar calendar adopted by the Yellow Emperor more than 4,000 years
ago. The holiday has been called Spring Festival since 1911 AD,
when the last Chinese emperor stepped down from the throne.
</P>
<P>
The first day of Spring is the first of the 24 solar cycles
adopted by the Chinese more than 3,000 years ago to time seasonal
farming activities. To get the 24 cycles, Chinese divide the 360
degrees that the earth rotates around the sun into 24 equal parts.
The start of each part kicks off a new solar term, marking 15
degrees of the earth's orbit.
</P>
<P>
Since the length of the lunar year isn't the same as the time
it takes the earth to rotate once around the sun, the lunar New
Year's Eve rarely falls on the same day as the first day of Spring.
</P>
<P>
And it gets even more complicated when you throw in the fact
that ancient Chinese emperors reset the date of the lunar New Year
every time a dynasty changed.
</P>
<P>
In the past 2,000-plus years since 221 BC, the lunar New Year's
eve has been the same as the first day of Spring in China only six
times. The last occurrence was on January 27, 1484.

<P>
BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Wang Hao, a computer-savvy 17-
year-old in Beijing, broke with the ancient Chinese custom of
making dumplings on New Year's Eve and bought his family a spicy
Spring Festival meal over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
For the modest sum of 155 yuan (19 U.S. dollars), he hired one
of the city's most famous Sichuan-style chefs to cook and serve a
meal directly from the Wang's kitchen.
</P>
<P>
Wang is one of thousands of Internet-addicted Chinese enjoying
the expanding largesse of China-based Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
This Chinese New Year which began Saturday, people are hooked
on sending e-greeting cards from www.Sina.com or ordering flowers
at www.flowercity.com.cn in Shanghai for those special someones in
the city. People in other parts of the country, and even in the
United States and other parts of the world also sent orders to the
site.
</P>
<P>
An Internet contest to judge love-letter writing skills has
also been popular in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"I have spent 40 consecutive hours surfing the Internet since
the lunar New Year's eve," a Beijing resident told Xinhua. "It's
great fun!"
</P>
<P>
Surely it is. The web site www.leyou.com offers sound and video
tracks of firecrackers that are banned in major cities in China.
</P>
<P>
The traditional Chinese festival proved to be an opportunity
for companies to tap into the biggest market in the world: the
Chinese-speaking people.
</P>
<P>
Beijing-based website www.8848.com is advertising on-line
discount sales of goods ranging from televisions to cellular
phones. The www.bta.net.cn site opened an on-line festival fair,
complete with a lottery for site visitors.
</P>
<P>
Tourism website www.ctn.com.cn is publicizing prices and
tourist routes of all major travel agents in China, while www.
shanglu.com has already booked ten travelers for a "snow trek" in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, one of every six Beijing
residents uses the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Even in China's rural areas, farmers began to learn to use the
Internet to send greetings to their relatives this Spring Festival.

<P>
CANBERRA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Victoria state
Premier Steve Bracks said on Sunday the Chinese community was a
long-standing part of the state's harmonious multi-cultural system
as he helped launch Melbourne's Chinese new year celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Fighting to speak over the din of exploding Chinese crackers
from street celebrations, he said the Chinese community presented
compelling evidence of the benefits of migration to Australia.
</P>
<P>
Bracks endorsed an increase in the migrant intake.
</P>
<P>
"We need more migrants ... we want more migrants," Bracks said
at the official opening of the festivities on a street stage in
the heart of Melbourne's China town precinct.
</P>
<P>
He said: "I'm hoping my government will draw on some of the
dragon's energy," a reference to this year being the year of the
dragon for the Chinese and one that symbolizes good luck.
</P>
<P>
Bracks also praised the Federation of the Chinese Community
Associations in Victoria for keeping alive Chinese culture.
</P>
<P>
Amid clouds of firecracker smoke that descended over the area
of Little Bourke and Russell Streets in the city, and the banging
of drums accompanying the dragon's performance, around 200,000
spectators are expected to witness the Chinese new year
celebrations.

<HEADLINE> S. African President Pledges to Amend Rigid Labor Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 6 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Thabo Mbeki pledged to amend unreasonable aspects of the labor
laws that are strangling small businesses.
</P>
<P>
The costly burden of negotiating the labor laws had been "an
unintended consequence" of the government's labor market policy,
the president said in an interview broadcast on television Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The burdens placed on small businessmen to comply with some of
these provisions are quite unreasonable," Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
He said many small companies and non-governmental organizations
did not have enough money to hire lawyers to advise them on the
requirements of the law.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said he had begun a new and intensive interaction with
trade unions through a presidential working group to bring the
unions on board on a range of contentious economic policies aimed
at attracting investment.
</P>
<P>
These include the setting of inflation targets, the lifting of
exchange controls, the right-sizing of the public service and
faster privatization.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said the public behavior of the unions "gave a one-sided"
picture of what was happening and what was possible.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no hesitation to deal with these issues," he
said. "In the engagement, I really think we can deal with all of
these challenges in an intelligent way."
</P>
<P>
In his state of the nation address to parliament Friday, the
president said amendments to the Labor Relations Act, Basic
Conditions of Employment Act and Insolvency Act would be
introduced later this year.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the government would not turn its back on an
approach that respected labor rights for workers.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot agree that we should have an economy based on poorly
paid workers," he said. "We would never agree with such a policy
or with a policy that would take away rights... that are normal to
all of the developed countries."

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 6 (Xinhua) -- About 80.8 percent of Chinese
people support the tight control of firecrackers traditionally
used to celebrate the Chinese New Year, a recent survey by the
Horizon Investigation Company shows.
</P>
<P>
The survey held recently questioned 3,126 families in ten
cities including Shanghai, Beijing, Wuhan, Nantong, and Shenyang,
80 percent of whom had known the ban on firecrackers in their
cities.
</P>
<P>
Beijing kicked off its ban on fireworks on December 1, 1993,
hoping to protect the people who like to use them as well as the
local environment.
</P>
<P>
But 28 hospitals in the capital city have reported more than
100 people, many of whom live in fireworks banning areas, were
injured by firecrackers during this year's Spring Festival, which
began on Saturday. Some people were permanently blinded by the
exploding fireworks, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
According to the city's public security department, Beijing has
uncovered several cases of illegal transportation and sale of
firecrackers, and fireworks valued at 50,000 yuan were seized in
the capital in the past month.
</P>
<P>
Meng Xuenong, vice-mayor of Beijing, noted that Beijing will
continue to control use of firecrackers in the holiday season.

CAIRO, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Saudi Ministry of Agriculture and Water has decided to
build 53 enterprises nationwide this year, including three giant
desalination plants, with a total investment of over 171 million U.
S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The three plants, when in operation, will have a combined
production of 170,000 cubic meters of water per day, the Saudi News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The water-strapped Saudi Arabia is the biggest desalinated water
producer in the world at a capacity of 2 million cubic meters of
water per day.
</P>
<P>
RYADH -- Saudi and Iranian businessmen are meeting in the Red
Sea resort of Jeddah on Sunday to discuss carrying water from Iran
to Saudi Arabia in addition to 13 other industrial projects.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi economic daily al-Iktsadia quoted Saudi and Iranian
commerce sources as saying that the planned projects are aimed at
gearing up joint investments and cooperation between the countries
in such fields as metallurgy, agriculture, real estate and textile.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- Cyprus' 2000 State Budget was approved by the House
of Representatives Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The budget foresees expenditure at 2,007.4 billion Cyprus pounds
(4,014.8 billion U.S. dollars) and revenues at 1,366 billion pounds
(2,732 billion dollars). The deficit is etimated at some 660
million pounds (1,320 million dollars), higher than that in the
1999 budget.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- Cypriot and Israeli business people formed an
association to promote commercial, financial and business relations
between the two countries, the Cyprus News Agency reported
Saturday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> mee020608hke - Israeli Army Mull Virtual Parachuting Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSLAEM, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Israel Defense Forces (IDF)
are considering replacing the real bailout jump with more advanced
virtual parachuting training, the Jerusalem Post daily reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The army is looking for a budget to purchase or lease a number
of sophisticated parachuting simulators from an U.S. company for
the IDF Jump School at Tel Nof Air Base, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The simulator includes computer-linked goggles and earphones,
and soldiers strap themselves into a harness suspended at an
altitude measured in mere centimeters. Electric fans are used for a
more realistic effect. It can also be programmed to simulate
various malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
A commander of IDF Jump School was quoted by Bamahaneh, the IDF
weekly, as saying that the simulator is simply wonderful.
</P>
<P>
"It gives the tools to deal with all the problems related to
parachuting training....The sensation is quite realistic. This
simulator will allow us to simulate operational drops into
sensitive locations, like heavily populated sites," the commander
said.
</P>
<P>
Some military sources believe that this simulator could help the
soldiers improve their parachuting technique cheaply and be a safer
substitute for the real-jump training course, which had been
severely restricted by economic constraints.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the cost of parachuting 40 soldiers from a
real plane is about 60,000 shekels (about 15,000 U.S. dollars),
which makes soldiers in Israeli airborne units rarely jump over 10
times in their military career.
</P>
<P>
However, some IDF officers insisted that the simulator certainly
cannot replace the real thing and is merely a way to better prepare
the soldiers for their jumps.

<P>
TEHRAN, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The ground force of the Iranian
army on Sunday launched the main stage of a military exercise in
the western Ilam province to mark the 21st anniversary of the 1979
Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian state-run television reported that troops involved
in the maneuvers were airlifted by C-130 aircraft from the southern
Fars province to the war games zone with the assistance of the air
forces and the airborne units of the ground forces.
</P>
<P>
The television showed that thousands of parachute soldiers and
military equipment were carried to the targeted region of the
exercises, codenamed "Zolfaqar of Velayat 2."
</P>
<P>
The ground troops kicked off the war games, codenamed "Zolfaqar
of Velayat 1" on Tuesday in the southwestern province of Khuzestan.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear how long the war games would last.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Commander of the ground force Brigadier General Ebrahim
Ashtiani said last week that the two maneuvers of "Zolfaqar of
Velayat 1 and 2" were designed to boost rapid deployment of the
ground force.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the first maneuvers, the land force would be
dispatched from northwestern Iran to three areas of Ahvaz, Dezful
and Abadan in the southwestern province of Khuzestan and then
lifted by choppers to the southern borders to go on the exercises.
</P>
<P>
The commander said that the second exercise in western Iran
would include dispatching parachute troops from Shiraz, the
southern Fars province to the western towns of Mehran, Salehabad
and Ilam in the border province of Ilam.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Bring Down Dependence on Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Sunday that it is lowering its dependence on oil for its energy
requirements to just 10 percent this year, as part of its long-
range plans to cushion the effects of oil price increases on the
economy.
</P>
<P>
"Before, we were dependent on oil for our power generation
about 60 percent. Last year we brought it down already to 20
percent. This year we are targeting to bring it down to just 10
percent," said Energy Secretary Mario Tiaoqui in a statement
issued here.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is now harnessing alternative sources of
energy, such as geothermal, hydro and coal.
</P>
<P>
In 2002, Tiaoqui said, the government expects to harness
natural gas from Malampaya in offshore Palawan, which could make
the country completely self-reliant in its power generation needs.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is also continuing to entice new players
to come in by providing them with incentives to bring down the
prices of oil products in the country.

<HEADLINE> S. African Terror Groups Face Banning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government is seeking to ban groups responsible for bombings and
other acts of terror by using a powerful new anti-terrorism law.
</P>
<P>
The Anti-Terrorism Bill, now under investigation by the South
African Law Commission, could also make membership of such groups
a punishable offence, a parliament source said.
</P>
<P>
The source, who refused to be named, said the proposed
legislation will give police and the government's elite law
enforcement unit, the Scorpions, other sweeping new powers to aid
the war against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
A draft of the bill and a discussion document which is expected
to be finalized before April will be considered by the Law
Commission on security legislation next Saturday, according to the
Sunday Times.
</P>
<P>
The report said that under investigation are measures which
could provide for:
</P>
<P>
-- Investigators to apply to the courts, within possibly 48
hours, to detain a suspect for a longer period;
</P>
<P>
-- Special search-and-seizure powers which will apply
specially to acts of terrorism;
</P>
<P>
-- A review of police powers of detention and interrogation;
and
</P>
<P>
-- Heavy penalties for supporting a banned organization and
conviction for terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The legislation is being drafted in terms of clear guidelines
given to the commission's drafting team by the government, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Once the draft bill has been approved by the commission, it
will be published for comment.
</P>
<P>
South African President Thabo Mbeki said Saturday that the new
anti- terrorism legislation would be drafted within the framework
of the Constitution.

<HEADLINE> Talks on Pullout Maps Cancelled: Palestinian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian-Israeli peace
negotiations on maps of the Israel's delayed third-stage troops
redeployment in the West Bank will not continue Sunday, a senior
Palestinian official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said that stands
between the two sides over the troop redeployment and the final-
status talks are still far apart, Radio Palestine reported.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator to the final-status talks Yasser
Abed Rabbo and his Israeli counterpart met Saturday night in the
residence of U.S. Ambassador Martin Indyk, discussing the
outstanding issues in the interim period, especially the delayed
land transfer. The talks ended with naught outcome.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said Israel's insistence on incorporating the third and
last phase pullout in the final-status talks and postponing the
February 13 deadline for a framework agreement has created a crisis
in the current negotiations.
</P>
<P>
According to an interim peace deal last September, Israel should
have carried out the third-phase troop redeployment in the West
Bank on January 20 and conclude a framework agreement by February
13 and a permanent peace deal by September 20 this year.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross were also present at
the meeting last night in Indyk's Herzliya home, north of Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who arrived in the region last Wednesday with a aim to
give the sluggish peace talks a push, will fly back to Washington
to brief the U.S. government on the latest developments in the
Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ross promised that the U.S. will continue its role as a mediator
in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel are undertaking marathon talks to
try to conclude a framework agreement on the thorniest issues such
as the fate of Jerusalem, Jewish settlements, borders and refugees
by mid-February.
</P>
<P>
But the 10-day marathon talks, which started last Sunday, have
achieved no results so far.

<HEADLINE> Barak to Meet With Jordan King Abdullah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak will fly to Jordan Sunday afternoon to meet with King
Abdullah Bin Hussein in an attempt to shore up the faltering
Palestinian-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
The visit came on the eve of the anniversary of the death of
Jordanian King Hussein, who died of cancer on February 7 last year.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will have a private meeting to discuss the peace
process between Israel and the Palestinians and bilateral economic
ties between Israel and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, as the second Arab state after Egypt that has signed a
peace treaty with Israel, has been playing an active role in
mediating in the Arab-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is also expected to touch on the stalled Syrian
track, since Abdullah has developed what Jordanian sources call "
excellent relations" with Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Syrian-Israeli talks that resumed last December hit a snag again
due to differences over which topics should be discussed first -
the return of the occupied Golan Heights or security arrangement
and normalization of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
On the Palestinian track, talks went nowhere though the 10-day
marathon talks, last-ditch efforts to meet the February 13 deadline
for a framework agreement on a permanent peace deal, has entered
its seventh day.
</P>
<P>
Both Israel and the Palestinians began a flurry of diplomatic
activities to drum up supports for their own position in the peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and several top Palestinian
officials are due in Egypt Sunday to attend a conference on the
displaced people in the 1967 Mideast war and are also planning to
meet top Egyptian officials.
</P>
<P>
The conference, involving Israel, the Palestinians, Jordan and
Egypt, has been suspended for several years.

BERLIN, February 6 (Xinhua) -- At least seven people were
killed and some 50 others injured in a serious train accident in
Germany Sunday morning, according to rescuers.
</P>
<P>
The cause for the derailment, which occurred in Bruehl near

Mehdorn, leader of the German Railway company, after he inspected
the spot.
</P>

The train carrying about 300 passengers from Amsterdam to Basle
derailed at the station in the town of Bruehl, south of Cologne,

were concerned.
</P>

Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat cast a
shadow over the troubled Palestinian-Israeli final status talks.

permanent peace deal.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Barak Hints New Stands on Syrian Border Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak has made signals to the U.S. that he is willing to spell out
his position regarding a future border with Syria, which could
break deadlock in peace talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post daily Sunday quoted officials in the Prime
Minister's office as saying that Barak had discussed the new stands
with U.S Middle East Special Coordinator Dennis Ross, who was in
the region to give the peace process a push.
</P>
<P>
The officials confirmed that Barak is interested in moving
forward the Syrian peace track and is ready to give some "quite
hypothetical clarifications on the border" to the Americans.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources emphasized that Barak had previously refused
to spell out his position on the border issue before receiving
clarifications from the Syrians on security and normalization
issues.
</P>
<P>
These officials believed that Syrian President Hafez al Assad
will be satisfied with Barak's new concession and agree to return
to the negotiation table. However, the Syrians have not made any
response to the offer yet.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks, resuming last December after a
45-month break, hit a snag again only after two rounds of talks due
to differences over agenda.
</P>
<P>
Syria is demanding Israel's public pledge to a full withdrawal
from the Golan Heights to the the June 4, 1967 borders on the eve
of the Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
But Israel insisted on discussion of security arrangements and
normalization of bilateral ties first.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Negotiators Met </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. ambassador to Israel
Martin Indyk brought together the top Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators Saturday night for informal talks, in a bid to move the
Israeli-Palestinian track forward.
</P>
<P>
The informal talks, which held at Indyk's residence in Herzliya,
north of Tel Aviv, and attended by Israeli chief negotiator Oded
Eran and his Paletinian counterpart Yasser Abed Rabbo, discussed
the differences over outstanding interim issues such as Israel's
next troop redeployment in the West Bank, confirmed a senior
Palestinian source Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians have rejected the maps submitted by Israel about
the third and last troops redeployment in the West Bank mandated in
a September interim deal. The troops withdrawal from another 6.1
percent of the West Bank land should have been carried out on
January 20.
</P>
<P>
Visiting U.S. Middle East special envoy Dennis Ross also
participated in the meeting, the first one organized by the U.S.
side after Thursday's summit between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at Erez Checkpoint ended
inconclusively.
</P>
<P>
No decisions were made at Saturday night's meeting, but the
Palestinian side explained to the U.S. officials about the major
concerns the Palestinians have related to the current final-status
talks, the source added.
</P>
<P>
"Non-stop marathon talks" between the Palestinians and Israel
are underway to try to meet the February 13 deadline for a
framework agreement on a permanent peace deal in September.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Thursday's summit between Arafat and Barak, the
source said Arafat was upset because Barak wants to link the last
redeployment to the signing of a framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was also angered by Barak's decision not to include Abu
Dis and another village around Jerusalem in the targeted lands for
pullback and his failure to consult he Palestinian leader about the
handover maps before making a final decision, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The source also disclosed that Barak had proposed to put off the
deadline for the framework agreement till September and that for
the final peace deal for nine months.
</P>
<P>
The delay for a permanent peace deal is totally unacceptable to
the Palestinian side, although Arafat does not mind a putoff of a
framework agreement and the Palestinian Liberation Organization
(PLO) Central Committee therefore decided Thursday night to set
September 2000 as the deadline for the declaration of an
independent Palestinian state, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is now under pressure from the hard-liners inside the PLO
leadership to suspend negotiations with Israel, the source added.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has sent officials to Egypt and Jordan during the last
two days to brief leaders of the two coutnries about the current
crisis in the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Barak is to fly to Jordan Sunday to discuss the
process with Jordannian King Abdullah, while Foreign Minister David
Levy is going to visit Egypt for the same purpose.

JERUSALEM, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk brought together the
top Israeli and Palestinian negotiators Saturday night for informal
talks at his Herzliya home to try to iron out their differences
over the outstanding interim agreement issues, including the next
West Bank withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
"There will be an explosion if we can't reach some sort of
framework agreement by March" when U.S. presidential primaries end,
Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials believe that by then President Bill
Clinton will no longer be in a position to make serious foreign-
policy decisions.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Lebanese Hezbollah guerrilla's leader Hassam Nasrallah warned
Saturday that his group is ready to retaliate for Friday's abortive
Israel Air Force attempt to kill one of the organization's senior
military commanders, saying it will "choose the appropriate time
and place."
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim Ikal, commander of Hezbollah's fighting arm, was tracked
in his car by Apache helicopters. He apparently became aware that
he was under surveillance and sped into a village, seeking a hiding
place.
</P>
<P>
The first Hellfire missiles struck the rear of Ikal's car and he
eventually ran into a wall, whereupon he was thrown form the car.
Then the second missile struck, but Ikal was unharmed. A third
missile was fired directly at him, but he was managed to escape it,
and disappeared into a house.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Ehud Barak is scheduled to visit Jordan Sunday
on the eve of the anniversary of the death of late King Hussein. He

43 police officers, 11 anti-rightist demonstrators, and two
bystanders were injured and 32 police vehicles damaged in the
riots.
</P>
<P>
Israeli government will discuss the Austrian situation in its
weekly meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry on Friday announced the recall of Israel's
ambassador to Austria in protest against the Freedom Party's
inclusion in the Austrian government. The party opposes immigration
and is sympathetic to aspects of Nazi rule.

<HEADLINE> Drought Hits Tanzania's Major Coffee Growing Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Due to the severe drought
from June to October last year, Karagwe District, one of the
leading coffee growing districts in Tanzania, will inevitably see
a big fall in the crop, media here said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Karagwe in northwest Tanzania will get low coffee yields for
the next two years, the Guardian newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
According to an official assessment, the weather situation
became critical in some parts of the district because the area did
not get enough rain in the last rainy.
</P>
<P>
Usually, the Karagwe District, famous for producing robusta
coffee, gets two rainy seasons per year.
</P>
<P>
The first season lasts from March to June and the second from
September to January.  The temperature went up to about 32
degrees centigrade in the district, coffee bushes dried up.
</P>
<P>
However, when the rainy season eventually started, the shrunken
coffee bushes had to be pruned so they could produce fresh shoots,
thus postponing the harvest.
</P>
<P>
Coffee is a major cash crop in Tanzania. Over 98 percent of its
total crop is exported.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian coffee remains a hot cake in the international
markets, no doubt due to its quality and quantity.

The Guardian:

</P>
<P>
Sunday Times:

<P>
-- The proposed hike in fuel price by the Nigerian Federal
Government has been shelved for the present by President Olusegun
Obasanjo. It was said that the gains of the hike will not be
worth the consequences it will likely have brought about.

<HEADLINE> Frost May Cause Heavy Loss to Kenyan Tea Sector: Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Multi-national tea companies
and farmers in the frost-hit Rift Valley Province in southern
Kenya may lose some 350 million U.S. dollars in the next six
months, officials of tea companies said.
</P>
<P>
The officials said they and small-scale framers stood to lose
heavily due to the freak frost which has forced the closure of
eight tea factories, the Sunday Nation newspaper reported. .
</P>
<P>
They also noted that since their companies, which own the
largest tea estates and are the biggest tea producers in the
region, were worried about the impact of the frost on their
performance on the Nairobi Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The crop is expected to recover if sustainable rains started
now, they said, adding that the crop will have to be pruned.
</P>
<P>
A devastating frost swept through parts of Rift Valley and
Nyanza provinces in the early hours last Saturday, leaving a
65-year-old woman dead and eight other people injured.
</P>
<P>
The frost had reduced the temperature in the tea growing zones
to approximately negative 10 degrees, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan Agriculture Ministry and provincial administration
officials said that between 20,000 and 40,000 acres of tea had
been destroyed by the frost, in addition to 6,000 to 9,000 acres
operated by small-scale farmers.
</P>
<P>
Tea alone accounts for about a quarter of Kenya's foreign
exchange earnings and employs over tow million people.

<P>
Fireworks are another must on the eve of the Spring Festival.
But most of the major cities have banned fireworks for safety and
noise pollution concern.
</P>
<P>
As a compromise, authorities in many cities have arranged for
fireworks shows in public squares.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, hotels in the suburb have attracted many customers,
because fireworks are allowed there.
</P>
<P>
An investigation by a Beijing polling company in 10 cities
including Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan and others, show that more than
80 percent of the citizens said they support the banning of
fireworks.
</P>
<P>
The first and most important thing to do on the first day of
the Spring Festival is saying hello to elders in the families,
relatives and friends.
</P>
<P>
Today more and more people are using new media to send their
blessing. In Beijing, the telephone bureau connected more than two
million long-distance calls from 08:00 pm Friday to 02:00 am
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In northeast China's Shenyang City, sending your blessing
message on friends' pagers is a new fashion this year. The city of
4.8 million people is said to have more than one million pagers.
</P>
<P>
Apparently, sending cards in the post office is no more in
vogue. A group of pupils in Beijing have in a public letter called
for the use of more electronic cards on the Internet to save
forests.
</P>
<P>
A new dress for everyone before the Spring Festival used to be
a must task for housewives. This year, ladies in Beijing invented
a new fashion: wadded jackets in traditional Chinese style.
</P>
<P>
In food, clothes, entertainment and many other fields,
traditional Chinese things have been fighting against Western
things for popularity. Increasing cases have been reported
recently in which traditional Chinese things have won the up hands.
</P>
<P>
A new must on city dwellers' buying lists before the New Year
is fresh flower. Officials at the Guangzhou Baiyun International
Airport in south China said they are sending 40 tons of flowers
everyday to other cities.
</P>
<P>
The same city is also sending out seven train coaches and forty
trucks of fresh flowers everyday to northern cities, according to
reports from there.

<P>
BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Lunar New Year, or the
Spring Festival, has always been a time of joy and happiness, a
time of family reunion, fine cuisine, new clothes, sleepless night
with carnivals. Yet something has been changing in all this.
</P>
<P>
When the Spring Festival comes, millions of people are going
home to join their family, and millions of others want to go
sightseeing on the holiday.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that six million people will travel by air
during the festival, with a ridership of 1.45 billion for buses,
30 million by water and 128 million by railway.
</P>
<P>
For those who want to go out, getting the tickets used to be a
big headache. Today, the headache remains, but things are much
better.
</P>
<P>
Railway passengers today can buy any tickets at any sales
windows at railway stations, thanks to a nationwide computer sales
network. There would be no more "sorry, you've taken the wrong
line."
</P>
<P>
And of course, you could go to many websites for whatever
tickets you want. And they would deliver the tickets to you free.
It's only that sometimes the line is so busy that you just could
not get hooked with the net.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to efforts by the railway authorities, trains are
traveling almost twice faster than they were one or two years ago.
</P>
<P>
For the Chinese people, a big table of food in the house with a
big family sitting around on the eve of the Spring Festival is
what family reunion means.
</P>
<P>
Yet, today more and more families are having their new year eve
dinner in hotels. In Shanghai, one of China's largest cities, it
is estimated that at least 100,000 residents had their dinner in
hotels in the last couple of days.
</P>
<P>
Jiaozi, or dumpling, is what turkey means for Westerners on the
eve of Christmas. Yet even for those who choose to have their
dinner at home, they seem to have abandoned the pure joy of making
Jiaozi by themselves.
</P>
<P>
Huo Shaojie, a manager at Ruida Instant Food Company, told the
Beijing Evening News that their frozen Jiaozi is selling extremely
well. Some products are even in shortage because of the strong
demand.
</P>
<P>
"We have taken the lesson of last year and started to produce
on full capacity half a month ago, but we still underestimated the
market," he said.
</P>
<P>
The manager attributed the situation to the fact that people
are having too much entertainment today, so they don't have the
time for making Jiaozi by themselves, which is usually time
consuming.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said, it is because the quality of instant Jiaozi
has improved and it tastes as delicious as those made in home. (

<HEADLINE> Zambia, Angola to Discuss Border Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Joint Permanent Commission
of Zambia and Angola on defense and security will meet in the
Angolan capital Luanda Monday to discuss the tension on their
common border.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Home Affairs Minister Peter Machungwa revealed this to
the press at the weekend, the Zambian Sunday Mail newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian delegation will be led by Defence Minister Chitalu
Sampa and Machungwa.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting in Luanda will address matters relating to
security and bilateral ties between the two southern African
neighbors, Machungwa said.
</P>
<P>
It is important for the two countries to discuss issues about
security, the Zambian minister noted.
</P>
<P>
At the joint commission meeting, senior security officials of
the two sides could confer to strengthen bilateral relations in
defense, he said.
</P>
<P>
Security on the border has become a major concern following
recent attacks on Zambian villages by the armed men believed to be
soldiers of the Angolan rebel movement, the National Union for
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Moreover, issues concerning the war in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo (DRC) would also be discussed, Machungwa said.
</P>
<P>
Angola had sent troops to prop up the government of DRC
President Laurent Kabila after the rebels took up arms in the vast
central African country in August 1998.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Plans to Remove Crashed Plane From Lake Victoria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania Civil
Aviation Authority is considering plans to remove the wreckage of
a Sudanese cargo plane which plunged into Lake Victoria in the
country's northwestern Mwanza Region on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of procedure, the agency has contacted the
proprietors of the plane on its plans to remove the wreckage,
Director-General of the Tanzanian aviation authority Margaret
Munyagi said in Dar es Salaam Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The wreckage has to be removed" from the largest lake in
Africa as it could pose danger to marine vessels and be hazardous
to the environment, said Munyagi.
</P>
<P>
The government might initially bear the cost of fishing out the
wreckage, dismantling it and take the parts to places deemed fit
for dumping, media here said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The proprietors would then be required by law to refund the
costs incurred, Munyagi was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzania-chartered Boeing 707 plane belonged to the Trans
Arabian Air Transport of Sudan.
</P>
<P>
It was one of the three planes hired to collect fish fillet
from Mwanza for export to Europe. Tanzania resumed exports of
Lake Victoria fish fillet to Europe last Wednesday after a
10-month ban.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated plane was flying from Sudanese capital Khartoum
to Mwanza to collect tons of fish fillet there, but it undershot
while trying to land some four kilometers from the runway. All
the five crew members aboard survived.
</P>
<P>
This was the second accident involving a Boeing 707 plane at
Mwanza Airport.
</P>
<P>
The first one occurred some two years ago when one Boeing
crashed on the runway. Part of the wreckage is said to be still
lying there.

URUMQI, February 6 (Xinhua) -- A national survey on natural
resource exploitation and environmental improvement in the arid
areas of western China began recently in this capital city of
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The survey will take 100 research fellows and professors in
Beijing and Xinjiang more than five years to complete and is
expected to cost around 34 million yuan.
</P>

between the Helan and Kunlun mountains, making up one-quarter of
China's territory.
</P>
<P>
The current survey will focus on studying the evolution of the
environment in arid areas, the mechanism of ecological
degeneration, and ways of improving the ecology of the region.
</P>
<P>
When the survey is completed, researchers will draw up a plan
applicable for economic growth in these areas which will include
effective methods of ecological renewal, and measures to lessen

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Organic Fertilizer Plant Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The largest and most up-to-date
organic fertilizer plant ever built in China began operations
recently in the port city of Dalian in northeast China's Liaoning
Province.
</P>
<P>
The plant was built by Han Wei, a private owner of China's
largest chicken farm, at a cost of 20 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Equipped with technology provided by the Shenyang Applied
Ecology Research Institute (SAERI) under the Academy of Chinese
Sciences, the plant is expected to turn out 100,000 tons of
fertilizer this year, and has already received an order for 20,000
tons from Japan.
</P>
<P>
Experiments in Liaoning and Heilongjiang provinces show that
this fertilizer can raise the output of fruit, vegetables, and
flowers by 8 to 18 percent, said Wang Shujin, an institute
researcher.
</P>
<P>
Han raises 2 million chickens producing 80 tons of fresh eggs a
day, but the 200 tons of manure excreted by chickens everyday is a
headache, so Han collaborated with SAERI to build the fertilizer
plant.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Chinese Indonesians Celebrate Lunar New Year in Open  by Zhao Jinchuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- For the first time in more than
30 years, Chinese Indonesians openly and solemnly celebrated their
traditional Lunar New Year Saturday night, marking the beginning
of a new life for the ethnic Chinese in the country under the
leadership of a new democratic government.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of ethnic Chinese in Indonesia enjoyed their
celebration at Fatahillah Park in front of the Jakarta Historical
Museum on Saturday night. The festival, organized by the West
Jakarta Mayoralty and the Chinese Indonesians Commercial
Association in West Jakarta, featured the traditional Chinese
Barongsai (lion and dragon dance), Betawi (former name of Jakarta)
Tanjidor and Gambang Kromong musical performances and the Cokek
Chinese-Betawi folk dance.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua after officiating at the
celebration ceremony, Mayor of the West Jakarta H. Sarimun
Hadisaputra said the free celebration of the Chinese Lunar New
Year showed that the new government under the leadership of
President Abdurrahman Wahid is pushing forward the unity of all
nationals including the Chinese minority and the freedom of
religion and education in the country.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the racial discrimination policy carried out
by the New Order government headed by former President Soeharto in
the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
As Soeharto consolidated his power, he banned the use of the
Chinese language and forced the Chinese to adopt indigenous names
in a campaign of assimilation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in wave after wave of riots and political upheaval
taken place in the past 30 years, the Chinese Indonesians, who
make up now only 4 to 5 percent of Indonesia's population of 210
million, were terrorized and their houses and businesses wrecked
and burned.
</P>
<P>
But, as the year of the Golden Dragon begins, the Chinese
minority is feeling uncharacteristically optimistic thanks to
Indonesia's newly elected President Wahid who has called for
religious tolerance and lifted a 1967 ban on public Chinese
festivities before the Lunar New Year.
</P>
<P>
Business came to a standstill Saturday at a number of shopping
areas, especially in Chinatown in Glodok.
</P>
<P>
Most people celebrating the event chose to hold family
gatherings after praying at temples.
</P>
<P>
"People are not afraid anymore. They are happy," said Lau Xian
Sing, caretaker of Jakarta's oldest Chinese temple, Wihara Dharma
Bhakti, who like many frightened Chinese adopted an Indonesian-
sounding name, Solihin, in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time we are allowed to celebrate in the
streets for more than 30 years," said an ethnic Chinese historian,
Ong Kook Ham.
</P>
<P>
A old man said, "In the past, we had to go to Hong Kong,
Singapore or China just to see the new year's celebrations. Now
not anymore."
</P>
<P>
An ethnic Chinese resident of Pluit in North Jakarta Gunawan
expressed the hope that the government's new openness to the
Chinese culture would eventually lead to acceptance by all
Indonesians.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the government's stance will be followed by a general
acceptance of the culture," he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides the celebration in Chinatown and some areas in Jakarta,
the ethnic Chinese in several big cities, such as Surabaya, Medan,
Bandung, Semarang also conducted activities to mark the Lunar New
Year.
</P>
<P>
Even the state-run international telecommunication operator PT.
Indosat pitched in by launching a Gong Xi Facai (which means "wish
you will make a lot of money") PreCard to welcome the Chinese New
Year.
</P>
<P>
The PreCard depicts a golden dragon on a bright red background,
with the greeting "Gong Xi Facai" printed on it.
</P>
<P>
"We have launched this PreCard to show our care for customers
who celebrate the Chinese New Year," said Indar Atmanto, PT.
Indosat's general manager of marketing.

<P>
MANILA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines is opening up
its economic zones to agro-business, allowing local and foreign
investors to avail themselves of certain tax incentives normally
accorded to light industry and manufacturing projects, a senior
official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued here, Agriculture Secretary Edgardo
Angara said that this means high value crop growers, export-
oriented orchid producers and even food processors could operate
with computer chip makers and electric parts manufacturers inside
the economic zones, enjoying the same tax perks.
</P>
<P>
There are 61 economic zones, industrial parks and estates
operating in the Philippines today with a total area of 6,600
hectares.
</P>
<P>
To start the scheme, the government has already identified 1,
500 hectares of prime farm land inside the special economic zone
of the former Clark air base as an "agro-business park."
</P>
<P>
Foreign and local investors in the economic zones are normally
given tax incentives, including duty-free or tax-free entry of
capital equipment, income tax breaks for a certain period of time
and other financial perks.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Super Anti-Bacteria Fabric </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- China has developed a super
anti-bacteria cotton fabric for medical use by applying nanometric
techniques.
</P>
<P>
The medical dressing is a cotton fabric coated with super fine
particles of silver.
</P>
<P>
Processed with nanometric techniques, the silver particles are
only 0.1 micron in diameter on average, one-500th of the width of
human hair. With their exterior surface great extended and their
outer structure totally changed, the super fine silver particles
are 200 times more effective in killing bacteria than larger ones.
</P>
<P>
The silver particles can effectively curb the multiplication of
more than 40 kinds of bacteria, including colon bacillus. They can
prevent wound from festering and accelerate healing.
</P>
<P>
The dressing was developed by the Nanjing Xike Group in east
China's Jiangsu province. In clinical experiments, the medical
dressing showed superior character in treating wound, burn, ulcer
and gynecological diseases.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Navy has foiled
an attempt by a Tamil rebel to blast the Trincomalee Harbor in
Eastern Province, navy sources said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the attempt was made on the eve of
Independence Day celebrations on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Naval craft and government troops deployed on security duty
detected the suicide diver while he tried to enter the inner
harbor Friday morning and opened fire, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
A subsequent search of the area by naval divers led to the
recovery of a lower body part of a diver with diving gear.
</P>
<P>
The attempt was made to coincide with the 52nd anniversary of
the Independence Day but naval groups were on alert, the sources
added.
</P>
<P>
Trincomalee, one of the finest natural harbors in the world,
lies on the northeast coast of Sri Lanka, 260 kilometers from
Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The harbor is one of the most important ports in the country as
it is home to the country's key naval base.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels, who have been fighting for a separate Tamil
state in the north and east of the country, reportedly made
several attempts to destroy the harbor last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Party leaders of European
countries attending a two-day meeting here have expressed deep
concern over Austria's swerve to the right with some
representatives calling for suspension of the Austrian People's
Party from the European People's Party.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Saturday at the end of the "Europe 2010: the Future Is
in the Center" conference staged by the European People's Party,
chairman of the Spanish People's Party Jose Maria Aznar said that
allying with neo-Nazi party is radically contrary to the program
action of the party.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the Spanish People's Party also demanded
that the Austrian People's Party, the ruling partner of the far-
right Austrian Freedom Party, be kicked out of the European
People's Party.
</P>
<P>
Also party representatives from France, Belgium, the
Netherlands and Italy have aired support to the call of the
Spanish People's Party.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Forza Italia Silvio Berlusconi said that
Europeans could not accept Fascism.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Bulgarian Union of Democratic Forces and Prime
Minister Ivan Kostov called for a "firm opposition" against
exclusivism while President of European Parliament Nicole Fontaine
warned that tolerance of the far-right forces will result in "
dangerous" consequences.
</P>
<P>
The European People's Party will hold a formal meeting next
Thursday to decide on the future of the Austrian People's Party,
whose leader Wolfgang Schuessel became chancellor Friday after
allying with Haider's far-right Austrian Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
The European People's Party is composed of 22 self-styled
center-right parties, 16 of which have declared to swerve to "
center" or "reformed center" political road.

BEIJING -- China's first three insurance brokerage firms were
recently approved by the China's Insurance Regulatory Commission (
CIRC), Xinhua has learned.
</P>
<P>
The three firms will be located in Beijing, Shanghai, and
Guangzhou, and preparations for their formal launching have
already begun, according to industry sources here.
</P>
<P>
China's insurance sector has been growing at a rate of more
than 20 percent since insurers were allowed to resume business in
the country in 1980.
</P>
<P>
The nation's premiums were worth some 139 billion yuan in 1999,
compared to 13.1 billion yuan in 1989.
</P>
<P>
However, China had not formally approved a single insurance
brokerage firm until now, which has kept major players out of the

KIEV -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma on Saturday pledged
to close down Chernobyl nuclear power plant this year at a meeting
with visiting U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, the Ukrainian
president's spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"During the conversation, Kuchma confirmed Ukraine's intention
to close down Chernobyl in 2000," the spokesman was quoted by
local press reports as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said they agreed that specialists from both sides would work
on technical problems in the next few months. Besides, they would
also complete the designing of two new reactors at the nuclear
plants in western Ukraine and discuss interim fuel deliveries to
Ukraine's thermal power stations before the new reactors come into
use.
</P>
<P>
The Group of Seven leading industrialized nations and the
European Union agreed in December, 1995, to offer Ukraine 2
billion U.S. dollars to construct the new reactors to compensate
the loss of Chernobyl.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine itself can not afford the closure of Chernobyl, an
aging plant built by the former Soviet Union, which accounts for 5
percent of the former Soviet republic's total electrical capacity.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Chinese New Year Celebrations Signal Better Economy in Thailand  by Xu Haijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Bangkok distinguishes itself
from other cities by having a large ethnic Chinese population, who
celebrated the Lunar New Year, which began on February 5 this year,
by unveiling a pailou, or a decorated archway, in the city's
Chinatown Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
The 16.45-meter-high pailou is dedicated by ethnic Chinese in
Thailand to the much beloved King Bhumibol Adulyadej for his
lenient policy toward the ethnic Chinese.
</P>
<P>
However, in another sense, the pailou has become a symbol of
Thailand's economic recovery in view of the fact that its
construction had taken two years as it was repeatedly interrupted
by the liquidity constraint of the sponsors.
</P>
<P>
In year 1999, Thailand re-discovered the pleasure of a positive
economic growth as its gross domestic product increased by 4
percent compared with a nearly 10-percent contraction in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The country's international reserves stood at a strong 34.8
billion U.S. dollars at the end of 1999 while inflation dropped to
0.3 percent from 8.1 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Given signs of a recovering Thai economy, ethnic Chinese here
enthusiastically celebrated the arrival of the Year of the Dragon,
which is considered especially auspicious by the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
In Bangkok's Chinatown, better known as Yaowarat, traders of
chicken, oranges and other things considered a must for the local
Chinese New Year family rituals are experiencing their busiest
days in a year.
</P>
<P>
A chicken trader said he had to order 500 chickens every day
instead of the normal 40 to 50 to meet the rising demand during
the festival. Meanwhile, the price of oranges rose from 30 baht (0.
8 dollars)per kilogram to 50 baht (1.3 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Thai Farmers' Research Center, a renowned research institute,
projected that cash flow would reach 10 billion baht (266.8
million dollars) during the Chinese New Year, which was celebrated
during this weekend in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The domestic tourist market is likely to grow by 5 percent
during the festival and the number of those travelling will reach
1.6 million, generating a 3-billion-baht (80-million-dollar) cash
flow, the center said.
</P>
<P>
Thongchai is a self-employed driver, who supports his wife and
three children by driving foreign tourists or holiday-making
Bangkokians from the capital to picturesque provinces.
</P>
<P>
He said he and his family had benefited from the country's
booming tourism last year.
</P>
<P>
"My wife and I bought two mobile phones recently, thanks to the
increasing tourists," Thongchai told Xinhua at the street-turned-
night market in Yaowarat Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"With the new mobiles, my wife and I will have better
communications with each other, which will surely bring us more
clients," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Tourism Authority of Thailand, foreign tourist
arrivals last year were estimated at 8 million, bringing the
country some 300 billion baht (8 billion dollars) in revenue.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the domestic tourist market, which had been
severely hurt by the financial crisis, has also shown signs of
recovery.
</P>
<P>
Goldsmith shops, a hallmark of Yaowarat, are good places to
observe consumer spending during the Chinese New Year, as people
tend to buy gold ornaments with their traditional extra payments
for the festival.
</P>
<P>
A sales manager in So Seng Heng Goldsmith Co. Ltd., who refused
to be named, told Xinhua that business of his company has
increased by 30 to 40 percent during the past year.
</P>
<P>
He expected a 50-percent rise in daily sales during the
festival but refused to give a figure, calling it a business
secret.
</P>
<P>
According to Bank of Thailand, the country's central bank, the
private-consumption index grew by 3.8 percent in 1999 while the
consumer-confidence index also improved from 60 in the first
quarter of 1999 to 84.3 in the final quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
Suparat, running a sharks' fin restaurant in Yaowarat, said
business of his restaurant went up by about 30 percent in the past
year from a year earlier, thanks to an increasing number of
businessmen who revived their habit of dining out with their
clients and partners.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese tradition, the dragon represents good luck,
strength and power. Businesses here, big or small, Chinese or non-
Chinese, all anticipated that the golden dragon will bring them
just those in the coming new year.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Parties Hold Meetings on Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Parties of the Sri Lankan
ruling People's Alliance (PA) held a series of meetings last week
on a new constitution for the country, the Sunday observer
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The parties have so far had six meetings, which have been "very
productive" and consensus has been reached on several key issues
including devolution, informed political sources were quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
As a result of these talks, the government has been able to
accommodate the concerns voiced by some sections without harming
the original draft, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Areas on which consensus has been reached include the executive
presidency, the sources said, adding that the next phase of talks
will concentrate on the electoral system.
</P>
<P>
The government decided last month to present a draft
constitution in the parliament in three months to end the
protracted ethnic conflicts in the country.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been troubled by a long-running war between the
government troops and Tamil rebels who have been fighting since
1983 for a separate Tamil state in the north and east of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The government has proposed the draft constitution to end the
ethnic war by devolving more powers to regional councils,
including one in the northeast administered by minority Tamils to
partly meet Tamil rebels' demand for independence.
</P>
<P>
But the draft constitution has been stalled in the parliament
for more than three years for want of a two-third majority due to
the lack of the United National Party support.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Pledges Chernobyl Closure in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
on Saturday pledged to close down Chernobyl nuclear power plant
this year at a meeting with visiting U.S. Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson, the Ukrainian president's spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"During the conversation, Kuchma confirmed Ukraine's intention
to close down Chernobyl in 2000," the spokesman was quoted by
local press reports as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said they agreed that specialists from both sides would work
on technical problems in the next few months. Besides, they would
also complete the designing of two new reactors at the nuclear
plants in western Ukraine and discuss interim fuel deliveries to
Ukraine's thermal power stations before the new reactors come into
use.
</P>
<P>
The Group of Seven leading industrialized nations and the
European Union agreed in December, 1995, to offer Ukraine 2
billion U.S. dollars to construct the new reactors to compensate
the loss of Chernobyl.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine itself can not afford the closure of Chernobyl, an
aging plant built by the former Soviet Union, which accounts for 5
percent of the former Soviet republic's total electrical capacity.
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union decided to close down Chernobyl before 1993
after the world's worst civil nuclear disaster occurred in April,
1986 when one of its reactors exploded. But the decision was
vetoed by Ukraine in October, 1993.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian officials have complained that the Western countries
have been dilatory in funding the closure of Chernobyl, one of
whose reactors is still functioning.

<HEADLINE> KFOR Commander Appeals for Calm After Ethnic Clashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The commander of peacekeepers
in the Kosovo city of Mitrovica appealed for calm on Saturday
after a second day of clashes between his forces and rioting
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
"Extremists of whatever kind only want to maintain a situation
of chaos," said French General Pierre de Saqui de Sannes, briefing
the press after his forces, for a second day, clashed with ethnic
Albanians who were forcing their way into the northern part of the
city where ethnic Serbs are living.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is extremely serious," said the general.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of ethnic Albanian extremists confronted French
peacekeepers with stones and gasoline fireballs near the main
bridge separating the two rival ethnic groups in the city of
Mitrovica. Eleven peacekeepers were wounded, Yugoslavia's state
news agency Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
The clashes followed on the heels of a series of violence
targeting civilians with 12 Serbs injured, after a group of ethnic
Albanian extremists attacked a small bar in the Serbian quarters
in the city on Thursday night. Two Turkish residents and two
ethnic Albanians were killed, 6 ethnic Albanians and 15 Serbs were
injured, in collisions when thousands of Serbs gathered in a
protesting rally afterward.
</P>
<P>
An overnight curfew effective from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. local time
had been imposed in Mitrovica by KFOR.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela, U.S. Surmount Diplomatic Scrapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela and the United States
have surmounted their recent diplomatic scrapes caused by the
meddling of Washington in Venezuela's domestic affairs,
Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan foreign minister and U.S. ambassador in Caracas,
John Maisto, said after a meeting in the day that the bilateral
relations are "excellent."
</P>
<P>
The "impasse has been surpassed for the time being," said
Rangel, after the Venezuelan government noticed a total
rectification from the United States about the public statements
made by a high ranking U.S. official that Washington's patience
would be worn out by the bad management of the government in
Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
"We are satisfied by now," said Rangel, "What we heard from
Ambassador Maisto were completely different" to that of U.S.
Undersecretary of State for Interamerican Affairs Peter Romero,
who told recently the Spanish newspaper ABC that "There is no
government management."
</P>
<P>
Romero's "threatening and unfriendly" words, according to
Rangel, caused a stir in the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry, which
immediately demanded rectification from the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister did not specify literally the
rectification of Maisto, although it had assured Wednesday that a
bulletin from the U.S. embassy denied the words of Romero, saying
that the United States government acknowledges the Venezuelan
government efforts to make constitutional reforms.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that his government will continue
supporting the efforts made by the Venezuelan government toward
the political reforms, the struggle against drug trafficking, the
judicial reform, the efforts against corruption, and the creation
of a good climate for investment.

<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian
government and the National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrillas have
agreed on the rules for future peace talks, reports reaching here
said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was struck at meetings held in Cuba, Venezuela
and Colombia by representatives of the government and the ELN
central command, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
The ELN committed itself in the nine-point memorandum to
respect the civil, judicial and religious authorities, while the
government will pull back army and police forces stationed in
negotiations zone, which has yet to be defined.
</P>
<P>
The ELN demands a 7,600-square-kilometer demilitarized zone in
the municipalities of Simiti, Santa Rosa, San Pablo, and Morales,
in the department of Bolivar, but the government, the inhabitants
and the local authorities oppose the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The guerrilla promised to abstain from any military operations
in the zone, accepted surveillance by a civic guard made up of
inhabitants of the demilitarized municipalities, to cooperate in a
program aimed at preventing and eradicating drug trafficking from
the zone.
</P>
<P>
The ELN also committed itself to abstain from intensifying its
armed actions against the oil industry, the energy network, as
well as holdups and mass and selective kidnappings when the peace
negotiations process starts.
</P>
<P>
The ELN is the second largest rebel group in Colombia after the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
</P>
<P>
The nearly 40-year-long civil war has inflicted the South
American country with huge material damages and claimed more than
35,000 lives in just 10 years.

TEHRAN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- At least one person was killed
and four others injured in a series of explosions on Saturday in a
main street in the Iranian capital city of Tehran, the state-run
television reported.
</P>
<P>

office and the parliament.

<P>
An aide to the president said that President Mohammad Khatami
was not injured in the blast.
</P>
<P>
The television said that five pedestrians were injured in the
explosions, one of them died at hospital.

Organization (MKO) for the explosions while Tehran radio said that
the MKO has claimed responsibility for the blasts.

were engaged in a white-hot struggle ahead of the sensitive

LONDON -- The Irish Republican Army issued a statement on
Saturday in which it said the deadlock over weapons can be
resolved -- but not on British or unionist terms.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued shortly before Sinn Fein president
Gerry Adams and the Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble met at
Stormont in an effort to save the faltering peace process.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, Trimble said the IRA statement was
disappointing, and contained "nothing new."
</P>
<P>
"There's no new proposal contained in it and I think that's
most unfortunate," he said.
</P>
<P>
Adams said the two leaders had agreed to meet again.
</P>
<P>
He added the IRA statement underlined the difficulties created
for republicans by the Northern Ireland secretary in Westminster
on Thursday. (UK-IRA-Arms Issue)

MOSCOW -- A senior Russian general said Friday that some
federal troops will be withdrawn from Chechnya following the major
destruction of rebels in the breakaway republic in the past few
days.
</P>
<P>
"Following the defeat of large rebel formations, including
those in Grozny, the size of the federal force will be reduced,"
said Valery Manilov, first deputy chief of the General Staff of
the Russian Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,500 rebels were killed over the recent several days,
a major breakthrough in the federal campaign against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
He categorically denied the possibility of a guerrilla war in
the republic. "All talk about a guerrilla war is a deliberate or
erroneous mystification," the Interfax news agency quoted him as
saying at a press conference. (Russia-Chechnya-Operation)

<HEADLINE> China Approves First Insurance Brokers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- China's first three insurance
brokerage firms were recently approved by the China's Insurance
Regulatory Commission (CIRC), Xinhua has learned.
</P>
<P>
The three firms will be located in Beijing, Shanghai, and
Guangzhou, and preparations for their formal launching have
already begun, according to industry sources here.
</P>
<P>
China's insurance sector has been growing at a rate of more
than 20 percent since insurers were allowed to resume business in
the country in 1980.
</P>
<P>
The nation's premiums were worth some 139 billion yuan in 1999,
compared to 13.1 billion yuan in 1989.
</P>
<P>
However, China had not formally approved a single insurance
brokerage firm until now, which has kept major players out of the
insurance market here.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the huge number of insurance agents in China employed by
insurance firms to sell their products, brokers represent the
interests of customers and are able to do much more in helping
them choose, and even design, the best insurance policies for
their needs, according to industry observers.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Government Rocked by Resignation of Peace Deal Signatory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese government was
rattled by a new crisis after a signatory of the 1997 peace deal
resigned from his leadership posts of the southern rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
Riefk Mashar Teny-Dhurgon, chief of the Coordination Council of
Southern Province Affairs, on Friday tabled his resignation
quitting all his political and executive posts except leader of the
Southern Sudanese Defense Forces.
</P>
<P>
The move was in protest against the government violation of the
peace accord under which the nomination and firing of provincial
leaders should be entrusted to the Coordination Council of Southern
Province Affairs, the Al-Sahafi Eddawli daily reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Advisory Council for Peace and the government have been
making efforts to defuse the crisis, which might stain the
credibility of the government, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Mashar, also leader of the Democratic Salvation Front that
groups six southern opposition factions, signed the Khartoum Peace
Accord with the government in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Mashar's resignation was no surprise," political observers here
said, citing the repeated violations of the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
However, the government held the Wehdah (Unity) provincial
government responsible for the deterioration of situation and urged
it to carry out the political and security provisions of the
Khartoum deal, including the formation of joint military teams and
police in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
It accused the Wehdah provincial government of repeatedly
violating the accord by firing and nominating leaders of southern
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Mashar was also second commander of the rebel Sudanese People's
Liberation Army which has been fighting the government over the
last 16 years to establish an independent state in the south which
is predominantly populated by Christians.

<P>
CAIRO, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic news
briefs from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Saudi banks have applied to open branches in Iran in
order to provide a full range of banking services to local market
and Gulf investors with a view to boost bilateral commercial
exchanges and increase the trade volume between Riyadh and Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The applications are currently under consideration by the
banking authorities in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Sources here confirmed that these bank branches will provide
various services to those who enjoy special privileges and
incentives offered by the Iranian authorities seeking to attract
Gulf capital to Iran.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Some 70 Egyptian leading industrial companies are
expected to participate in the 17th session of the Khartoum
international exhibition, which will be held on February 17-28.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa called for
measures taken to address the sharp trade imbalance between Egypt
and China.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Egyptian trade volume was 750 million U.S. dollars in
1999, of which Egypt's exports to China stood at 35 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Moussa expressed hope that the bilateral trade volume would hit
1 billion dollars within one or two years. Therefore, he urged
Egyptian businessmen to increase their exports to China.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he noted that the volume of China's investments in
Egypt stands at 15 million dollars so far.
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed belief that Egypt's private and public
sectors were able to increase exports to and investments in China.
</P>
<P>
He also called for working out an action plan on Egyptian-
Chinese economic cooperation to be headed by Prime Minister Atef
Obeid.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Egyptian government will introduce a bill prepared
by the Ministry of Economy to regulate share ownership of Egyptian
banks and insurance companies, said Minister of Economy and Foreign
Trade Youssef Boutros Ghali.
</P>
<P>
The draft law would regulate the conditions and procedures for
Egyptian and foreign investments in the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
The law requires that a watchdog authority be informed when over
5 percent of a bank or insurance company shares are owned by a
single shareholder.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Government Recommended to Relieve Mashar of Duties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese National Security
Council (NSC) on Sunday sent a recommendation to President Omar el-
Bashir to relieve a pro-government opposition leader of his duties.
</P>
<P>
The NSC held its first session on the security situation in the
al-Wehdah (unity) province in southern Sudan since Riefk Mashar
Teny-Dhurgon, chief of the Coordination Council of Southern
Province Affairs, tabled his resignation on Friday to First Vice
President Ali Osman Mohamed Taha.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday Taha held a two-hour urgent meeting with leaders of
the Democratic Salvation Front (DSF) to contain the deteriorating
situation believed to have triggered a new government crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Mashar's resignation was a failure and unjustifiable," the NSC
said, expressing keenness on maintaining peace and continuing the
implementation of the Khartoum Peace Accord signed in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
Mashar was one of the prominent south Sudanese leaders who
signed the peace accord with the government. He was also leader of
the DSF that groups six signatory factions of the accord.
</P>
<P>
He announced to quit all his political and executive posts
except leader of the Southern Sudanese Defense Forces, in protest
against the government violation of the peace accord under which
the nomination and firing of provincial leaders should be entrusted
to the Coordination Council of Southern Province Affairs.
</P>
<P>
However, the government argued that implementation of the peace
accord made significant progress and a joint political committee
would revise the implementation process.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has been torn by a 16-year-long civil war in which the
rebel Sudanese People's Liberation Army has been fighting the
government to establish an independent state in the mainly
Christian and animist south.

<HEADLINE> Hijacked Plane Lands in Moscow, Maybe Heading for London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 6 (Xinhua) -- A hijacked Afghan passenger
plane landed in the Sheremetevo-1 airport here Sunday night with
131 passengers and nine crew members aboard.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency quoted intelligence sources as saying
that the hijackers wanted the airliner to fly on to London after
refueling in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing-727 landed at 21:41 local time (1841 GMT) after
being given food and fuel at the Aktyubinsk airport in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
Agents of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), the main
successor to the KGB, are at the scene, where the hijacked plane
was parked at the remotest part of the airport, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers demanded that the plane be refueled and that 181
portions of food be provided, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
The plane, which was flying a domestic flight from the Afghan
capital of Kabul to the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif, was
diverted to Tashkent, Uzbekistan, for refueling.
</P>
<P>
Ten passengers, including two children, were released in
Tashkent.
</P>
<P>
The plane then flew to the Aktyubinsk airport of Kazakhstan,
where three more passengers were released, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
There are 10 hijackers aboard the plane, the Interfax said,
citing sources with the Kazakh special services.
</P>
<P>
Tass, quoting two of the 10 passengers released in Tashkent,
said that the hijackers were armed with pistols and grenades.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen announced that the plane was hijacked about 10-15
minutes after take-off, but refrained from disclosing their plan
and demands.
</P>
<P>
However, the independent Afghan Islamic Press reported earlier
that the hijackers were demanding the release of the former
governor of an Afghan province held by the ruling Taliban.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Decide on Bilateral Ties With Austria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 6 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Thabo Mbeki Sunday said his government has yet to decide on its
bilateral relations with Austria.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after Austrian President Thomas Klestil
swore in Friday a controversial coalition government formed by the
conservative People's Party and the far-right Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
In an interview on South African Broadcasting Corporation's
"News Maker" program on Sunday, Mbeki said his country is closely
monitoring the political situation in Austria.
</P>
<P>
The admission of the Freedom Party led by Joerg Haider into the
 coalition government in Austria has been met with widespread
international condemnation.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Seized Russian Ship Carried Iraqi Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ship will be taken to Muscat, the capital of Oman, and the
oil will be off-loaded, Cohen told reporters while flying back
from Germany, according to an Associated Press report.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that the Omani government will determine the fate of
the merchant vessel, Volgoneft-147, and its crew. The tanker was
seized by the U.S. Navy Wednesday on suspicion of smuggling oil
from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi naval officer was on board the ship when it was seized
by U.S. Navy SEAL commandos and the tests were completed Sunday on
samples of oil from the tanker, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
"They do reveal that the oil was from Iraq. But the government
of Oman will make a determination as to what they will do with the
ship itself. That's up to the Omanis at this point," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen also told reporters that he does not believe that the
incident will have any impact on relations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
"Diplomatically, I assume the State Department will take
whatever action it will take. But this is a privately owned ship.
It is not owned by the Russian government," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Moscow said that the Russian Foreign Ministry said
that the ship carried no Iraqi oil but only Iranian heavy fuel oil
loaded in Iranian waters. Moscow asked the ship to be released
immediately after it is unloaded.
</P>
<P>
The United States has added another warship to the Gulf since
the Russian tanker was seized and was intensifying the monitoring
efforts, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
Under the sanction regime of the United Nations, Iraq is
allowed to sell oil worth 5.26 billion U.S. dollars to buy food
and medicine every six month. Iraq has been under the sanction
since 1990 after Iraq invaded Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice FM Expounds China's Foreign, Security Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Foreign Minister
Wang Guangya expounded China's foreign and security policy at the
36th Munich security conference Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The annual Munich security conference was held on February 5
to 6 in Munich, the capitol of the state of Bayern in the south of
Germany.
</P>
<P>
It is for the second time that the Chinese government sends
its delegation to the annual conference in Munich.
</P>
<P>
At Sunday's conference, Wang Guangya said in his speech that
this conference, held at the important moment of the turn of the
century, is of special significance.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that in the past century, mankind saw two world wars
and a cold war of nearly half a century and paid a painful price
for its pursuit of peace. After the end of the cold war, the
international pattern has undergone drastic changes and the world
has been moving towards multi-polarity, which is now an
irreversible trend of the times. People are full of hopes for the
future. It is the common aspiration and voice of the people of all
countries to seek peace, stability and development. But
regrettably, the longed-for peace has not come and the world today
is still far from tranquil. There has been somewhat an increase in
the destabilizing factors in the international political, economic
and security fields, with new development in hegemonism and power
politics and a greater tendency towards strengthening military
blocs and resorting to force in handling international affairs.
</P>
<P>
About the Kosovo war, Wang said that the war was a local war
that took place on the European continent at the end of the 20th
century, but it will have direct and far-reaching implications on
the international situation and state-to-state relations in the
new century. It has prompted the international community to
profound reflections on future peace and security.
</P>
<P>
About the international vicissitudes, Wang stressed that China
will unswervingly focus on economic development, push forward with
reform and opening up, adhere to the independent foreign policy of
peace, resolutely safeguard state sovereignty, territorial
integrity, national dignity and state security, work to create a
long-term peaceful and stabile international and surrounding
environment for its economic development, maintain world peace,
oppose hegemony and power politics and promote common development.
</P>
<P>
As a major country in Asia-Pacific, China has a keen interest
in peace and stability in the region. At present, the political
and security situation in this region is, on the whole, relatively
stabile. Most countries have seen marked improvement in their
economy. Strengthening dialogue and cooperation has become the
main trend in the relations among the countries in the region. The
core of China's Asia-Pacific security strategy is to increase
mutual understanding and trust with other countries in the region,
maintain regional peace and stability and safeguard China's own
security and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
About the Taiwan question, Wang stressed that Taiwan is an
inalienable part of Chinese territory. The Chinese government will
settle the Taiwan question strictly in accordance with the basic
principle of "peaceful reunification and one country, two systems"
and firmly opposes any separatist plot, statements and actions
aimed at creating "Taiwan independence," "two Chinas" or "one
China, one Taiwan." The Taiwan question is purely an internal
affair of China. If any countries or military alliances attempt to
include the Taiwan Straits into their security cooperation program,
directly or indirectly, that amounts to encroachment on and
interference in China's sovereignty. The Chinese government is
resolutely opposed to arms sales to Taiwan by any country, as this
not only violates the basic principles of international law, but
also directly threatens China's security and regional peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
Finally, Wang Guangya stressed that in the new century, the
government and people of China will continue to work for the lofty
cause of the humanity to safeguard world peace and promote common
development. China will work alongside all the other peace-loving
countries and peoples and contribute its part to creating a new
world of peace, stability, cooperation and prosperity in the new
century.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton Announces Senate Candidacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I may be new to the neighborhood, but I'm not new to your
concerns," Hillary said, with President Bill Clinton and their
daughter Chelsy sitting behind on the podium.
</P>
<P>
Hillary vowed to work for better schools, better health care
and gun control, describing herself as a "new Democrat."
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe that government is the source of all our
problems or the solutions to them," she said.
</P>
<P>
The first lady is expected to fight against Rudolph Giuliani,
the Republican mayor of New York City, whose term expires in two
years with no hope for extension.
</P>
<P>
Giuliani has not yet announced his Senate candidacy so far, but
reports indicate that he was also preparing himself for the
parliamentary election scheduled for November.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton hugged his wife and daughter after Hillary
finished her speech. He said no word but it is believed that he's
one of her top advisers as she resumes the career she put aside to
help him capture the White House.
</P>
<P>
By announcing her Senate candidacy, Hillary has decided to step
out of the shadow of her husband, who has less than a year to
remain in the white House. He is going to finish his second term
in office early next year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Alaska Plane Returns to Airport with Stabilizer Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Alaska Airlines jet
returned to Reno/Tahoe International Airport in Nevada State
shortly after takeoff as the pilot reported problems with the
horizontal stabilizer -- the third such incident involving that
plane model within a week.
</P>
<P>
The Seattle-bound MD-83 jetliner's problems Saturday night were
similar to those discussed by pilots in the tense minutes before
Alaska Airlines Fight 261 crashed into the Pacific on January 31.
</P>
<P>
No survivors have been found following the crash of the Alaska
airlines jet with 88 people from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. The
plane, which plunged into the ocean about 65 kilometers northwest
of Los Angeles, was en route to San Francisco, and then Seattle.
The cause of that accident has not been determined.
</P>
<P>
On February 1, an American Airlines MD-83 had trouble with its
horizontal stabilizer after takeoff from Phoenix in Arizona State.
It returned safely to the airport.
</P>
<P>
The Seattle-bound jet, Flight 631, left the airport at about 7
p.m. local time Saturday. It headed back after seven or eight
minutes when the pilot reported that the motors which control the
stabilizer were operating improperly.
</P>
<P>
Alaska Airlines does not plan to ground its 35 MD-83 jetliners
or to make any unscheduled maintenance checks, said Jack Evans, a
spokesman for the Seattle-based airline.
</P>
<P>
The horizontal stabilizer is a wing-like part on the tail
manipulated by the pilot to provide balance along the entire
fuselage. An MD-83 stabilizer is about 13 meters.

<HEADLINE> 36th Munich Conference for Security Policy Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ministers from European countries and the USA, German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer, Chairman of the German opposition CDU
Wolfgang Schaeuble, Premier of the state Bayern Stoiber, and
deputies from the People's Republic of China, Japan and India and
other countries attended the two-day conference.
</P>
<P>
The main theme of this conference is strengthening the role of
Europe in NATO. The Kosovo war showed that Europe must modernize
its armed forces and play a far bigger role in the NATO alliance,
said NATO Secretary General Lord George Robertson in his speech.
</P>
<P>
The former secretary general of NATO, the commissioner for the
common foreign and security policy of the European Union (EU)
Javier Solana, stressed that the European security policy is also
the interests of the USA. He appealed to the governments of
European countries for putting more money for the program that was
adopted at the EU summit in Helsinki last December. He said, "
Nobody can expect that security is cheap to get."
</P>
<P>
German Minister of Defense Rudolf Scharping tried to dismiss
the worries of the USA that the form of forces for crisis
reaction of the EU will weaken NATO. Scharping said, "NATO will
keep a key role for the security of Europe." The crisis in the
European region must be the subject of the dialog between NATO and
the EU in the future. Before that, U.S. Secretary of Defense
William Cohen warned of the form of parallel security structures
in NATO and in the EU. German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer
required that the partners of the EU should have the final say
about the NMD of the USA.
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting, Cohen criticized the European allied
countries sharply. He blamed straightforward and without
diplomatic polish that the European countries will reduce its
expenditure of national defense. Cohen said that Europe must say
little and put more in action according to an interview with the
German journal "Sueddeutsche Zeitung."
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that such serious difference has arisen
between the U.S. and its European allies.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Wang Guangya made a speech Sunday
at the meeting. He expressed alarm over plans by the United States
to create an anti-missile defense system and lashed out at human
rights interference by outsiders in the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the U.S. was set to violate its obligations
under the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty in a quest for "
absolute security."
</P>
<P>
"This move will undoubtedly inflict severe damage on global
strategic balance and stability, undermine the international
security environment... and may even trigger a new round of arms
race," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
"For this, the international community cannot but express deep
apprehension," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice foreign minister rejected the human rights
interference in China by outsiders.
</P>
<P>
"Facts have proven that interfering in other countries'
internal affairs in the name of 'human rights' will only be
counterproductive," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"It will, instead of protecting human rights, undermine
regional stability and directly jeopardize international peace and
security," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
It is for the second time that the Chinese government sends its
deputy to attend the Munich Conference for Security Policy.
</P>
<P>
As a rising world power Asia is playing a more and more
important role on the world arena. The delegates of Japan and
India also made speeches.
</P>
<P>
The 36th Munich Conference for Security Policy finished at noon
Sunday. The annual conference for security policy began in 1964.

MOSCOW, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian special agencies are
ready for any emergency with the hijacked Afghan Boeing-727 plane,
which landed at Moscow's Sheremetyevo-1 airport Sunday evening,
while diplomats from the Afghan embassy were joining talks with
the hijackers, reported the Itar-Tass news agency.

</P>
<P>
The hijackers have demanded fuel and 181 food rations. It maybe
a direct sign of their intention to leave Moscow, said the source.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, diplomats from the Afghan embassy in Russia have
joined negotiations of Russian secret services with the hijackers,
said the Russian Air Transport Service.
</P>
<P>

LONDON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- A bomb exploded at the back of a
hotel in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, Sunday but caused no
casualties.
</P>
<P>
The explosion happened at Mahon's Hotel at about 1920 GMT in
Irvinestown, in County Fermanagh, which is some 145 kilometers
west of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
The hotel had been evacuated following a warning call to BBC
Belfast 35 minutes earlier.
</P>
<P>
The BBC said the device may have been left in a white Cadillac
used for weddings.
</P>
<P>
Army bomb disposal experts were at the scene and the street has
been sealed off.
</P>
<P>
A second hotel, the Manor House Hotel in Killydeas, also near
Enniskillen, was also mentioned in the warning.
</P>
<P>
Following the blast, Ulster Unionist security spokesman Ken
Maginnis said he was due to visit the hotel where the blast
occurred Monday morning to attend a meeting concerning a rural
transport initiative.
</P>
<P>
Martin McGuinness from Sinn Fein condemned the attack, saying
those who were responsible were unrepresentative of the republican
movement.
</P>
<P>
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, although
several warnings were phoned to media organizations before the
bomb from a person claiming to be from the Continuity IRA, the
only dissident republican paramilitary group not on ceasefire.
