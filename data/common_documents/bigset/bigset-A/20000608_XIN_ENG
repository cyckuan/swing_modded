<HEADLINE> Albania Urges Black Sea Nations to Cooperate in Integration with EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Albania Wednesday called on the
Black Sea countries to forge closer cooperation in their bid for
integration with the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Albanian parliament speaker Skender Gjinushi made the call at
the 15th session of the Parliamentary Assembly of Black Sea
Economic Cooperation (PABSEC), which opened here Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Gjinushi, current president of the regional forum designed to
help Black Sea countries to join the EU, said that the forum
should establish and develop stable relations with the EU and the
Conference for Security and Cooperation in the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
It is also important to implement the Southeast Europe
Stability Pact projects because they will create the fundamental
premises for the inclusion of the Balkan countries into the
integration process, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Stability Pact, spearheaded by Western countries after the
Kosovo War against Yugoslavia, promises the Balkan countries,
excluding Yugoslavia, economic and political assistance and
eventual integration with the EU.
</P>
<P>
Last July and November, a donor conference drew more than 3
billion U.S. dollars in pledges to rebuild Kosovo, a Yugoslav
province ruined during last year's 78-day NATO air bombing.
</P>
<P>
On March 28 this year, another conference was held in Brussels
to look for about 1.1 billion euros (one billion dollars) to fund
quick-started projects in the neighboring countries of Yugoslavia,
which were affected by the war.
</P>
<P>
The projects include roads, ports, airports and bridges,
particularly a second highway bridge linking Bulgaria and Romania
over the Danube River, re-connection of damaged power grids and
management of water reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
Albania, which will hand over the six-month PABSEC presidency
to Armenia at the on-going meeting, is one of the Balkan countries
trying hard to join the EU and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).

<HEADLINE> Olympic Clock to Mark Countdown to Sydney Games 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Embassy in Beijing
on Wednesday celebrated 100 days to the start of the Sydney 2000
Olympic Games with the unveiling of a special countdown clock.
</P>
<P>
Australian Ambassador to China David Irvine said the bright
colors of the countdown clock -- featuring the official logo of
the Games -- were symbolic of the spirit of enthusiasm in
Australia for making this one of the greatest Olympic Games ever
held. The clock will be a feature of the entrance to the
Australian Embassy in Beijing until the beginning of the Games.
</P>
<P>
One hundred days from Wednesday the teams from the 200 nations
and regions participating in the Games will march into Stadium
Australia, the main Olympic stadium, and the largest outdoor venue
in Olympic history.
</P>
<P>
"They will be watched by a capacity of 110,000 people at the
stadium, who I am sure will give the Chinese team a warm rousing
welcome. A further 3.5 billion people overseas -- including
several hundred million in China, will watch the event on
television," Irvine said.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's event is also a prelude to the beginning of the
Australian, and the final, section of the Olympic Torch relay.
After it was lit in Olympia on May 10, the flame spent 10 days in
Greece and 17 days travelling through the Pacific Islands, and
will arrive in Australia on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Over 1 Million Eritreans Need Help: UNHCR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Over 1 million Eritreans need help
as a result of the Eritrea-Ethiopia war compounded by serious
drought, the Nairobi office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) said here on Wednesday in a statement.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, this figure includes some 750,000
people having fled their homes to escape the border fighting
between Eritrea and Ethiopia last month, while the rest 370,000
are drought-affected ones.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the situation, the statement said, UNHCR is taking
relief actions, including an initial appeal for 7.5 million U.S.
dollars to cover immediate needs in Eritrea, Sudan, Yemen and
Djibouti following massive displacement and refugee exodus.
</P>
<P>
The agency will start on Friday to direct airlift of 25,000
blankets to Eritrea's capital Asmara from stocks in Copenhagen,
the statement said, adding that another 75,000 blankets will be
airlifted to Asmara next week along with 25,000 jerry cans and
5,000 pieces of plastic sheeting.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR has already spent some 300,000 U.S. dollars in Eritrea in
 purchasing goods such as soap, kitchen sets and sanitary napkins
for distribution among the displaced Eritreans, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
It said that to support the operations by the Eritrean Relief
and Refugees Commission, 40 trucks and 20 trailers owned by UNHCR
are being used to deliver food and non-food aid to the internal
refugees.

also said there are very few parties truly interested in early
election.

<HEADLINE> Iran Stresses Diplomatic Solution to Tension with Turkey EDS-Repeats with correction in 13th para </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi here on Thursday stressed that Iran and Turkey should
resort to diplomatic means to solve any problem between them.
</P>
<P>
If Turkey has any ambiguity in its relations with Iran, it
should put it forward through diplomatic means, namely referring it
to the Joint Security Council between the two countries, Kharrazi
said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi made the appeal while answering a question on the
recent tension in relations between the two neighbors, which have
different political systems.
</P>
<P>
The tension arose last month when Iran blasted Turkey for
arresting hundreds of Iranians in Istanbul while the Turkish press
accused Iran of having a hand in the murders of pro-secular Turkish
intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit charged at the same time
that Tehran was giving support to armed Kurdish rebels and hard-
line Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
A further source of tension between the two countries came
earlier this week when an Iranian defector living in Turkey,
identified as Ahmad Behbahani, said Tehran was behind the bombing
of a Pan Am flight over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, killing 270
people.
</P>
<P>
Iran has denied any involvement in the Lockerbie bombing, and
rejected that its Intelligence Ministry has had any links with the
defector, whom it said was a robber.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Turkey announced that its president, Ahmet Necdet
Sezer, would not attend the summit of the 10-member Economic
Cooperation Organization (ECO), to be held in Tehran on Saturday.
The president will send a state minister as his representative.
</P>
<P>
A Turkish official said Sezer's absence is due to his busy
agenda as a new president who has just taken office last month. But
analysts believe the strained relationship is one of the major
factors behind the move.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference following the end of a one-day meeting
of ECO foreign ministers in preparation for the summit, Kharrazi
expressed his regret over Sezer's expected absence.
</P>
<P>
But he said that Turkey is a founding member of the
organization, and has paid great attention to its activities and
agreements. He hoped hat Ankara will continue its active role in
the regional economic group.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi was also critical of the Turkish media which alleged
that Iran meddled in Turkey's internal problems. The allegations
have created a very bad atmosphere for bilateral ties to develop,
he said.
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's meeting, ECO foreign ministers elected Abdolrahim
Gavahi, an advisor to Kharrazi, the new secretary-general of the
Tehran-based ECO secretariat. They also discussed issues about
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The ECO was founded in 1985 by Iran, Turkey and Pakistan. It was
joined by Afghanistan and the Central Asian and Caucasian republics
of Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and
Kazakhstan after the collapse of former Soviet Union in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela To Earn 10 Billion Dollars from Oil </HEADLINE>

CARACAS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's income from petroleum
may go up this year to around 10 billion U.S. dollars if the
barrel of average price is maintained at about 25 dollars, said
Thursday Energy Minister Ali Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan minister said that the surplus is due to the
national budget being calculated in a "prudent" way, with a 15
dollar price per barrel of crude, but so far this year, the
average stands at 24.98 dollars and 26.96 dollars up to Thursday.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urges Uganda, Rwanda to Implement Pullback Accord  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The call was issued by the Security Council in a press
statement following closed-door consultations.
</P>
<P>
In a separate statement, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
hoped that with the demilitarization of Kisangani, the DRC will
move closer to a comprehensive ceasefire and eventually a stable
and durable peace under the Lusaka ceasefire agreement .
</P>
<P>
Early Thursday, Annan contacted with Rwandan President Paul
Kagame and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and U.S. Ambassador
to the U.N. Richard Holbrooke who headed the Security Council
mission to the DRC in May and talked on the situation in Kisangani,
Annan's spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
Kagame and Museveni agreed to a ceasefire as of 10:00 a.m. (New
York time) and to withdraw their troops consistent with the
agreement reached between the two sides on May 21, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
Due to the latest fighting this week in Kisangani a significant
number of civilians were killed and at least five U.N. staff
injured.
</P>
<P>
Under Phase I of the Lusaka Agreement, the Rwandan troops will
withdraw south across the Congo River toward Ubundu and Lubutu,
and the Ugandan troops will pull back to positions north and east
of Kisangani toward Banalia and Bafwasende.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. force commander has been instructed to deal directly
with the Rwandan and Ugandan chiefs of staff on moving toward the
second phase of the ceasefire pact, which would involve further
pullbacks, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Mission to the DRC has 20 military observers in
Kasangani. It was agreed Thursday morning that the number be
increased immediately.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda used to be strong allies but now back
different rebel factions fighting in the DRC and have clashed
several times for control of Kisangani, a center of the vast
nation's diamond trade.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Concerned Over Rwanda, Uganda Conflict in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Pang Yong
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior Tanzanian official
Thursday expressed his deep concern over the resumption of
fighting between Rwandan and Ugandan troops in Kisangani, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and called for an
immediate ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation
Minister Jakaya Kikwete said here that Tanzania has received with
grave concern and disappointment the reports of new fighting
between the two parties and strongly urged the two governments to
respect their earlier commitments and understanding to pull their
troops out of the region.
</P>
<P>
The new hostility contravenes an agreement reached between the
leaders of the two countries at a meeting hosted by Tanzanian
President Benjamin Mkapa in the country's northwestern town of
Mwanza mid-May, he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The new development also contravenes the withdrawal plan drawn
up jointly by the commanders of the Uganda People's Defense Forces
and the Rwandan Patriotic Army following the Mwanza meeting, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete said the resumption of the fighting further impedes the
 implementation of the Lusaka ceasefire agreement signed last
July, which is vital in ending the conflict in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The minister appealed to the United Nations Security Council to
speedily deploy observers and peacekeeping envoys to Kisangani to
help normalize the social order and create an environment for
stability and tranquility in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania believes a quick move by the U.N. Security Council to
deploy security keepers and observers will facilitate prospects
for sustainable resolutions of the conflict in the DRC, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the Mwanza summit held in May, Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni and Rwandan President Paul Kagame signed a letter of
understanding to demilitarize their forces in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The latest fighting began Monday when Ugandan troops shelled
Rwandan positions in response to an attack on a Ugandan army
vehicle by unidentified assailants.
</P>
<P>
The fighting defied a U.N.-brokered ceasefire that was meant to
 demilitarize Kisangani, the main rear base used by Rwanda and
Uganda to support rival rebel factions fighting to overthrow DRC
President Laurent Kabila, who has been backed by troops from
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda forces entered the DRC nearly two years ago
as nominal allies to support a single rebel movement. However, the
rebel group split into two factions, and Rwanda and Uganda
gradually threw their support behind opposing sides.
</P>
<P>
Their difference culminated last August when they fought a
four-day battle in Kisangani in which dozens of civilians were
killed. This was worsened by another fighting between them last
month.
</P>
<P>
Under a peace accord signed last July in Lusaka, Zambia, all
five foreign armies operating in the DRC agreed to withdraw under
the supervision of a 5,500-strong U.N. force.
</P>
<P>
So far, no more than 100 unarmed U.N. military observers and
logistics experts have been deployed in the third largest country
in Africa.

Zambia's stand on Zimbabwe's land issue is a matter of
principle and will not change, he said, adding that all the
African countries which have not solved the land problem might sit
on a time bomb.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's land crisis broke out in February this year when war
veterans in the country began to occupy white-owned farms.
</P>
<P>
The war veterans, who participated in Zimbabwe's guerrilla war
against British settlers in the 1970s, have since occupied more
than 1,000 white commercial farms.
</P>
<P>
However, there is no sign yet that the land crisis would come
to an end soon as the war veterans threatened that they would stay
on the farms until land is redistributed to the landless black
Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean delegation is in Lusaka to have consultation
talks with Zambia's ruling party.

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Visit Egypt for Talks with Mubarak on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will
visit Egypt Friday for talks with President Hosni Mubarak on the
latest developments of the Middle East peace process, the
Palestinian ambassador in Cairo said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will review with Mubarak the results of the Mideast tour
by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the talks with
both of them, Zohdi al-Qedra was quoted as saying by Egypt's Middle
East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will listen to Mubarak's views and seek means of pushing
forward the peace process which is faltering "because of Israeli
evasive tactics," al-Qedra added.
</P>
<P>
Albright visited Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas on
Monday and Tuesday, and arrived in Cairo on Wednesday. Through her
mediation, the Palestinians and Israel agreed to resume final-
status negotiations near Washington next week for a framework
agreement and an eventual peace deal by September 13.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian diplomat urged the United States and President
Bill Clinton to pressure Israel into carrying out relevant
international resolutions, notably the United Nations Security
Council resolutions 242 and 338, under which a permanent, just and
comprehensive peace may be secured in the region.
</P>
<P>
Arafat frequently visits Egypt to consult and coordinate with
Mubarak on the peace process and seek his advice.

<P>
CAIRO, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs from
the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian Oil Minister Sameh Fahmi said on Thursday that
two factories will be constructed near Alexandria by February to
produce oil condensates and derivatives.
</P>
<P>
Fahmi said the projects, estimated to cost 1.12 billion Egyptian
pounds (325.58 million U.S. dollars), will refine crude oil from
Western Desert oil fields, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
One factory at a cost of about 700 million pounds (203.5 million
dollars) is designed to produce 96,000 tons of different kinds of
oil, 27,000 tons of wax and 100,000 tons of aromatics extracts each
year.
</P>
<P>
The other will have an annual capacity of 43,000 tons of butane
gas, 460,000 tons of heavy oil and 697,000 tons of wax.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The Federation of Gulf Chambers, based in the eastern
Saudi city of Dam, has issued an economic and legal encyclopedia
for the member states of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in the form
of compact discs (CD).
</P>
<P>
The encyclopedia contains more than 700 laws, regulations and
economic decrees. The price for one copy was fixed at 1,033 Saudi
rials (275 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The issuance is in line with the policy of attracting
investments to the region adopted by the Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt has wheat reserves to meet the demand for the
coming 135 days, Minister of Supply and Internal Trade Hassan Ali
Khedr has said, without giving the exact amount.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has completed wheat-importing plans for the 2000-
2001 fiscal year starting July 1, the English-language Egyptian
Gazette newspaper quoted Khedr as saying on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
And also, the government has allocated 300 million Egyptian
pounds (87.2 million U.S. dollars) to buy some 2.5 million tons of
wheat, estimated to be produced locally this year.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Saudi Oil Company (Aramco) has produced a small solar
cell able to produce potable water from the sea through the use of
solar energy.
</P>
<P>
The new solar cell can be easily manufactured and its raw
materials are available at reasonable prices. Besides,it has no
negative effects on the environment since the solar cell does not
use any materials causing pollution or harmful impacts on human
beings.
</P>
<P>
The invention helps invest the solar energy available all year
round in sea water desalination. Saudi Arabia is a desert country
which lacks natural water resources and the reserves of wells.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The "Boats and Yachts 2000" exhibition, staged in
Debia, north of Beirut, scored sales worth 15 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition was attended by more than 85 exhibitors
representing 200 leading companies in the area of manufacturing
boats and yachts.
</P>
<P>
Debia will host the "Boats and Yachts 2001" exhibition on May 30
to June 3 next year.

<HEADLINE> Romania's Agriculture Affected By Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Some 1.28 million ha agricultural
cultures in Romania are affected by drought, due to high
temperatures and lack of rain, reported the official Rompres news
agency on Thursday quoting a press release of the Agriculture
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Losses are estimated at 3,556.7 billion lei (170.5 million U.S.
dollars) which represents over 40 percent of production.
</P>
<P>
29 out of 41 Romanian counties are affected by drought, with
the most affected counties being in south, east and southeast.
</P>
<P>
The most affected culture is the wheat for which the losses
have been calculated at 1,421 billion lei (65.1 million U.S.
dollars),followed by the maize with 801 billion lei (38.4 million
U.S.dollars).
</P>
<P>
The only area still untouched by drought is Transylvania region

</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Minister Ioan Muresan is to initiate an
emergency ordinance for the lowering of irrigation's price.
</P>
<P>
The weather-forecasters say July and August will be even hotter,

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Launches Unique Center for Rape Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 8 (Xinhua) -- South African Ministry of
Justice Thursday launched a specialized reporting and care centre
for rape victims, the first of its kind in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Thuthuzela Center, a pilot project in Cape town, will serve
three police stations -- Manenberg, Khayelitsha and Guguletu --
that deal with 40 percent of all rape cases in the Western Cape,
the South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Designed to eliminate the so-called "secondary victimization",
the center will offer rape victims a sympathetic medical
examination, the opportunity of counselling, and wash and clean
clothes before they give statement to a trained investigating
officer.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors will also be available for advice, and cases from
the center will be prosecuted in a special sexual offences court
at the Wynberg Magistrates Court.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch, National Director of Public
Prosecutions Bulelani Ngcuka said that he hopes the center, which
will become fully functional in August, would inspire victims to
have confidence in the criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
"Our mission is to make justice more accessible to women and
children, and above all, to victims of crime," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Ngcuka, at present it took about nine months to a
year from the time of reporting to the finalizing of a rape case.
</P>
<P>
"We want to cut this to three months, while the incident is
still fresh in the victim's memory," said Bronwyn Pithey, who will
manage the center for Ngcuka's office.
</P>
<P>
The center aims not only to improve services to rape victims,
but also to boost the quality of investigation and prosecution of
rape cases, Pithey said.
</P>
<P>
One problem currently existing is that prosecutors and
investigating offices often do not work together very well, she
said, noting that delays in the process jeopardize both the
quality of investigations and the possibility of a successful
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Although some 50,000 cases of rape were reported nationally
last year, the conviction rate was only about 10 percent "which is
not very good", she said.
</P>
<P>
According to Pithey, the pilot would run for at least a year,
after which it would be assessed to see if it is viable and
whether it should be extended.
</P>
<P>
The center will deal only with women and girls over 13 years
old.
</P>
<P>
In her speech, Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang
described the project as a dream coming true for her and other
women who have for years been trying to make themselves heard on
the subject of rape.

<HEADLINE> Business Confidence in Mozambique Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Business confidence in Mozambique
fell sharply in the first quarter of this year, according to
findings of the Maputo branch of the auditing and consultancy firm
KPMG released on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
KPMG published a quarterly "business confidence index" deriving
from a questionnaire circulated among a representative sample of
businesses operating in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
In 1999 business confidence slowly fell, and the index hit 90.4
in the last quarter. But the figure in the first quarter of this
year was just 80, representing a 10 percent lower than the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
This decline represents the largest movement in the Business
Confidence Index in any quarter since it was launched in the third
quarter of 1998, KPMG said.
</P>
<P>
The only sectors which fared comparatively well were building
and real estate, and retail trade, with increases in confidence of
7 and 3 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The worst decline was shown by agro-industry, where confidence
fell by 32 percentage points. This was mainly due to the February
and March floods that devastated most of southern and central
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Communications, banking, and manufacturing industry showed
declines of 18, 13 and 12 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Another factor which KPMG believes may have impacted negatively
on the index was last December's general elections, and the
ensuing political dispute when the main opposition party, Renamo,
refused to accept the results.
</P>
<P>
Other factors which worried business were the rise in
inflation, the poor state of the country's road network,
difficulties in obtaining foreign currency, and the devaluation of
the metical in the first quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
Among the factors which businesses regarded in a positive light
were information technology, import and export controls, and
government stability.
</P>
<P>
Despite the slump in confidence, KPMG is optimistic about the
future. It pointed out that while this year's floods may slow
Mozambique down, "they do not represent the demise of the nation's
fledgling economy as presented in the international media".
</P>
<P>
Despite the floods, the projected GDP growth rate for this year
is 6 percent, and projections for growth in 2001 have been revised
upwards from 7.2 to 8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Iran Stresses Diplomatic Solution to Tension with Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi here on Thursday stressed that Iran and Turkey should
resort to diplomatic means to solve any problem between them.
</P>
<P>
If Turkey has any ambiguity in its relations with Iran, it
should put it forward through diplomatic means, namely referring it
to the Joint Security Council between the two countries, Kharrazi
said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi made the appeal while answering a question on the
recent tension in relations between the two neighbors, which have
different political systems.
</P>
<P>
The tension arose last month when Iran blasted Turkey for
arresting hundreds of Iranians in Istanbul while the Turkish press
accused Iran of having a hand in the murders of pro-secular Turkish
intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit charged at the same time
that Tehran was giving support to armed Kurdish rebels and hard-
line Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
A further source of tension between the two countries came
earlier this week when an Iranian defector living in Turkey,
identified as Ahmad Behbahani, said Tehran was behind the bombing
of a Pan Am flight over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, killing 270
people.
</P>
<P>
Iran has denied any involvement in the Lockerbie bombing, and
rejected that its Intelligence Ministry has had any links with the
defector, whom it said was a robber.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Turkey announced that its president, Ahmet Necdet
Sezer, would not attend the summit of the 10-member Economic
Cooperation Organization (ECO), to be held in Tehran on Saturday.
The president will send a state minister as his representative.
</P>
<P>
A Turkish official said Sezer's absence is due to his busy
agenda as a new president who has just taken office last month. But
analysts believe the strained relationship is one of the major
factors behind the move.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference following the end of a one-day meeting
of ECO foreign ministers in preparation for the summit, Kharrazi
expressed his regret over Sezer's expected absence.
</P>
<P>
But he said that Turkey is a founding member of the
organization, and has paid great attention to its activities and
agreements. He hoped hat Ankara will continue its active role in
the regional economic group.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi was also critical of the Turkish media which alleged
that Iran meddled in Turkey's internal problems. The allegations
have created a very bad atmosphere for bilateral ties to develop,
he said.
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's meeting, ECO foreign ministers elected Kharrazi
the new secretary-general of the Tehran-based ECO secretariat.
They also discussed issues about economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The ECO was founded in 1985 by Iran, Turkey and Pakistan. It was
joined by Afghanistan and the Central Asian and Caucasian republics
of Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and
Kazakhstan after the collapse of former Soviet Union in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Negotiators Hold Secret Talks on Jerusalem: Radio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli and Palestinian
negotiation teams for the so-called back-channel talks had been
holding "private conversations" in the past few days on the status
of Jerusalem, Israel's Army Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The teams, led respectively by Israeli Public Security Minister
Shlomo Ben-Ami and Palestinian Legislative Council Speaker Ahmed
Qurei, had reached an initial agreement on the Israeli troops'
withdrawal from two more villages near Jerusalem, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
Both villages -- Beit Hanina, which is under Israeli security
and Palestinian civilian control, and Shuafat, which is under sole
Israeli control -- lie north of Jerusalem and south of the West
Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Israeli cabinet and Knesset (parliament), under the push of
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, approved the transfer of three
Arab villages, Abu Dis, Azariya, and Swahara, on the outskirts of
Jerusalem to the Palestinians full control last month.
</P>
<P>
But the handover had been shelved because of the bloody clashes
in mid-May between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian demonstrators
who urged Israel to release more Palestinian security prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The fate of Jerusalem, as well as the return of Palestinian
refugees, the status of Jewish settlements, water, border and
security, are the most thorny final-status issues on the
negotiation table between Israel and the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
Israel claims Jerusalem as its "eternal and undivided capital,"
while the Palestinians want at least the Arab East Jerusalem to be
the capital for its future independent state.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Barak's office after Sunday's cabinet
meeting claimed that the prime minister had ordered Israeli
negotiators not to discuss the Jerusalem issue with their
Palestinian counterparts in any talks.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear so far whether the "private conversations"
between Ben-Ami and Qurei, who had cooperated in talks in the
Swedish capital of Stockholm in the past few months, had got
specific or tacit approval by Barak.
</P>
<P>
The two negotiation teams are scheduled to go to Washington on
Monday and resumed their talks there on a framework deal to pave
the way for an agreement on the final-status issues by September
13.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Jerusalem's top Muslim leader Mufti
Ikrima Sabri said Thursday that he would not accept any Israeli-
Palestinian peace treaty if it did not make East Jerusalem the
capital of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
"(There will be) no solution without Jerusalem being the capital
of the Palestinian state," Sabri stated.

<HEADLINE> Yemeni President to Visit Saudi Arabia to Discuss Ties, Border Demarcation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah
Saleh will start an official visit to Saudi Arabia on Sunday for
talks with Saudi leaders on bilateral ties and the pending issue of
border demarcation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Arab diplomatic sources in Saudi Arabia said Thursday that the
talks, to be held between Saleh and Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz
and Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz, will also cover the
current Arab and international developments, according to reports
by the Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The sources pointed out that "Saleh's visit comes amidst the
positive atmosphere witnessed in the relations between the two Arab
neighbors, which has resulted from a recent visit to Yemen by
Prince Abdullah."
</P>
<P>
Abdullah went to Sanaa on May 21 to take part in the 10th
anniversary of Yemen's unity.
</P>
<P>
On the demarcation of the Saudi-Yemeni borders, the sources said
the two countries have been advancing in great strides, adding that
officials from both sides have reiterated an agreement is almost at
hand.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Yemen need to re-demarcate their land borders
where 300 border signs have disappeared due to denudation and aging
factors. They also have to negotiate a settlement to the
demarcation of their maritime borders in the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
According to senior Saudi officials, the two states have
succeeded in relocating most of the land border posts, following
several years of work of their joint committees in charge of
specifying the border signs.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Urges Libya to Ensure Fair Trial of 6 Bulgarians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian Foreign Minister Nadezhda
Mikhailova called here on Thursday for guarantees to secure a fair
trial of six Bulgarian medical workers in Libya.
</P>
<P>
Reports have said that the six Bulgarians are standing trial in
Libya on charges of deliberately injecting 393 children with AIDS
virus.
</P>
<P>
"International observers should attend this trial in order to
ensure fairness," Mikhailova told a press conference after meeting
his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
"The Bulgarian-Libyan relations are good and efforts are exerted
to maintain them on that level," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Ensuring a fair trial for the Bulgarian defendants will
positively reflect on those ties," she said, noting that her
country is seeking a "satisfactory solution" for the two sides to
this thorny question.
</P>
<P>
While expressing sympathy for the Libyan children and their
families, she stressed that the fate of the six Bulgarian
physicians has also caused worries in the Bulgarian community in
Libya.
</P>
<P>
A large number of Bulgarians are working in Libya in the medical
and engineering fields, according to the Bulgarian foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
Terming the case as "very complicated," Mikhailova noted that
her country "understands very well the dimensions of the tragedy
and is seeking to reach the truth."
</P>
<P>
Mikhailova arrived in Cairo on Wednesday for a three-day visit
aimed at seeking Egypt's help to mediate a settlement of the case.
President Hosni Mubarak, who are on good terms with Libyan leader
Muammar Gaddafi, will held talks with Mikhailova later Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters that Egypt is exerting its utmost to help
the two countries find a cordial solution.

<HEADLINE> Photographers Tell About Rapid Changes in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Three Swiss photographers are
holding an exhibition in the western Swiss city of Vevey to tell
Swiss the tremendous changes in China's Shanghai with pictures
taken in one of the world's biggest cities.
</P>
<P>
Photographers Ferit Kuyas, Edy Brunner and Marco Paoluzzo
travelled together several times to one of the world's biggest and
fastest-growing cities for their joint-assignment, according to a
press release by the Swiss Camera Museum in Vevey Thursday, the
first day of the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
When they were in Shanghai, the photographers worked
independently,and only met in the evenings to compare notes. "We
were like fishermen discussing the size and quality of their catch
during the day," said Kuyas.
</P>
<P>
And what a catch. The result of their spending several weeks in
Shanghai is a multi-faceted portrait of a huge metropolis.
</P>
<P>
So rapid is the construction work in the Chinese city that the
photographers noticed major changes with each visit they made.
Some old quarters were disappearing to make way for highways and
new high-rise buildings, many of high architectural standards.
</P>
<P>
Despite the loss of old Shanghai, Kuyas - who has made
fascinating studies of some of the city's best examples of modern
architecture -is generally positive about the changes. "It's also
exciting to see new things grow," he said.
</P>
<P>
Marco Paoluzzo concentrated on the inhabitants, individually
and in groups, and it was not always easy: "It's difficult to take
photographs of people in China because many of them really don't
like it," he said. "So I had to steal most of them, and work very
fast so they didn't notice they were being photographed."
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will be open until September 10. A book,
published by Editions Stemmle, has been published with the
exhibition, and both have been timed to commemorate 50 years of
Chinese-Swiss diplomatic relations.

November 17, is believed to be behind the killing of Britain's
defense attache in Athens, Stephen Saunders, who was shot dead by
two unknown gunmen Thursday morning as he was driving alone to
work.
</P>
<P>
Greek police ballistics experts had completed the examination
of the four bullets found on the scene of the assassination of the
British senior diplomat, and the results of the examination showed
that the four bullets came from the same 45 caliber handgun used
in the assassinations of many other people in Greece by the
November 17 terrorist group, the Macedonian Press Agency (MPA)
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The MPA said that this fact confirmed the initial indications
that the terrorist organization was behind the new assassination.
</P>
<P>
The 45 caliber gun used Thursday in the killing of Saunders
has been used in 5 of the 22 assassinations that were committed in
the past 25 years by the November 17, and the first one killed
with such a gun was CIA station-master in Athens, Richard Welsh.
</P>
<P>
Saunders, 50, was in Greece for a year after serving in Hong
Kong, Cyprus and northern Iraq. He reportedly showed a special
interest on issues concerning Yugoslavia, Macedonia and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
Anti-terrorist analysts believed that the crucial posts
Saunders held in his career and his special knowledge on political
issues in regions that are unrest hot spots were the basic reasons
for which he was picked as a target by the terrorists.

sovereignty and peace in the Caucasus, Romanian Foreign Minister
Petre Roman told visiting Georgian counterpart Irakly
Menagarishvili in a meeting on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian and Georgian heads of diplomacy underscored the
need for regular consultations on issues of European and Euro-
Atlantic integration, security policy and border control. They
voiced their readiness to boost cooperation between the Romanian
and Georgian foreign ministries.
</P>
<P>
Roman and Menagarishvili discussed economic issues, expressing
their common wish to turn Caspian energy sources to good account.
</P>
<P>
"One can assert that energy stability at world level will
depend to an ever greater extent on the stability of the Caspian
energy sources and, in receiving these oil and gas reserves, very
much depends on a stable situation in the area," Roman pointed out.
The two officials decided to cooperate in telecommunications and
the transport of power resources.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian and Georgian Foreign Ministers attached the
particular significance to the development of the transcontinental

<HEADLINE> Uganda, Rwanda Urged to Stop Fighting Immediately </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim Thursday
strongly urged Uganda and Rwanda to stop fighting immediately in
Kisangani in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The recurring and continued fighting between troops of the two
neighbors in Kisangani is in complete contravention of the
agreements that have been negotiated by the two governments with
the support of Tanzania and the United Nations, Salim said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"What is even more disturbing is that the fighting is taking
place in the territory of another sovereign African state," he
said, noting "no amount of differences between the two parties can
justify such a situation."
</P>
<P>
According to the secretary-general, the fighting has apparently
 contributed to the exacerbation of tension in the region as it
has added to the instability and insecurity in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Appealing ceasefire between the two countries, Salim also urged
Uganda and Rwanda to abide by the terms of the Lusaka ceasefire
agreement signed by all belligerents last year and contribute to a
peaceful resolution of the crisis in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The latest clashes between Ugandan and Rwandan armies broke out
last Thursday in Kisangani after a vehicle belonging to the
Ugandan People's Defense Forces was attacked and destroyed by the
Rwandan Patriotic Army.

DIT and send two highly qualified computer experts to the
institute to run computer courses.
</P>
<P>
"The assistance for the setting-up of a computer laboratory in
the Dar es Salaam Institute of Technology by the Chinese side is a
small contribution to Tanzania for its development of high-tech,"
Wang said at the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"It demonstrates once again that the Chinese government and
people cherish dearly the friendship between our two great
countries."
</P>

<HEADLINE> 2,000 Lost, Abandoned Angolan Children Reunited With Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Some 2,000 Angolan children lost or
abandoned in the capital city of Luanda have been reunited with
their families since last year with the help of a program
sponsored by the National Institute for Children (INAC).
</P>
<P>
INAC provincial director Antonio Rosa Thursday said that in
Luanda there are some 5,000 children under the care of the
institute, 2,000 of which have rejoined their families.
</P>
<P>
There are a large number of gamins wandering about the streets
in the city, begging food and money, Rosa said, adding that paper
boxes or oil barrels are considered by those children as good
shelters at night.
</P>
<P>
The streets have "become home to thousands of children, who
were forced to leave their homes due to the military instability"
in the southern African country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The situation is deteriorating, he added, because many parents
"use their children to beg on the streets."
</P>
<P>
In Angola, there are currently some 3.7 million war-displaced
people gathering in major cities including Luanda, Huambo, Caala
and Uige.

<HEADLINE> Unmet Pledges Put Humanitarian Aid to Angola at Risk: WFP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- International assistance to Angola
could face an awkward situation in the coming months as many
pledges made by foreign donors had not been met, a spokeswoman for
the World Food Program (WFP) said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to Maria Flynn, the decline in the international
assistance will force the WFP to begin reducing its food programs
in the southern African country where the needs for the
humanitarian aid are swelling.
</P>
<P>
Flynn said the WFP had received only 46.5 percent of the
211,000 tons of pledged food aid, while the number of the
war-displaced Angolans counting on the WFP aid had increased to
1.5 million from 1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
"There is still no response" from the donors to an emergency
WFP appeal made on May 12, said Flynn, adding that "it will become
necessary to begin establishing priorities as to who gets aid and
who doesn't" in the following weeks.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Start Nationwide Campaign Against Polio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Angola has declared war against the
polio which has been torturing the country, with a nationwide
campaign against the disease to be started on June 10, a
government health official said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
One hundred of the 164 districts of the country will be covered
in the campaign, during which most children will be vaccinated,
respectively on June 10 to 11, July 17 to 18 and August 19 to 20.
Due to the military situation in the country, the campaign can not
reach the rest 64 districts, said the source.
</P>
<P>
During the campaign, priority will go for children under one
year old as they are the most vulnerable group, said the official
with the health department.
</P>
<P>
At least 1,100 cases of poliomyelitis were recorded in Angola
in 1999, with Luanda, Bengo and Benguela provinces being the most
hit regions, according to the source. But this number can not
reflect the real situation in the country, where a lot of patients
are out of the reach of the health system and can not be counted,
said local analysts.
</P>
<P>
Due to the long-term civil war, the campaign against the
poliomyelitis was largely hindered, which has made Angola have the
highest rate of the disease among the African countries.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Urged to Review Education Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 8 (Xinhua) -- South African Education
Minister Kader Asmal Thursday urged the government to review the
policy of providing free textbooks and stationery to every child.
</P>
<P>
The minister was quoted by South African Press Association as
saying in Cape Town that he is in favor of the recommendation by
the Curriculum 2005 Review Committee that there should be a
separation between providing learning materials and stationery.
</P>
<P>
"It is a very realistic recommendation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under previous dispensation, the provision of stationery and
textbooks was not even-handed, with only white, Indian and
coloured schools benefiting, while black schools were excluded.
</P>
<P>
The new democratic government came under fire every year
because of the problems with textbook delivery, but people forgot
that under the previous system only 8,000 schools benefitted and
now 29,000 schools had to be reached with the same budget, Asmal
said.
</P>
<P>
On whether the government should end its supply of stationery
to schools, the minister said although he is in favor of the
suggestion, the matter has to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
The government could not afford to continue to supply both
textbooks and stationery to every child, he said, adding that only
those poorest of the poor may have the chance to obtain them free
of charge.
</P>
<P>
According to Asmal, the review committee's report on Curriculum
2005 would be discussed at a meeting on June 19.
</P>
<P>
He repeated that the government is still committed to
outcomes-based education.

<P>
HARARE, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The occupation of mostly white-owned
 commercial farms by Zimbabwean war veterans will continue until
the land question is finally resolved, said war veterans leader
Chenjerai Hunzvi here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Zimbabwe News Agency, Hunzvi said that
the war veterans would stay on the farms until land is
redistributed to the landless black Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
"There is no going back on the land issue, whatever happens,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The war veterans, who participated in Zimbabwe's guerrilla war
against British settlers in the 1970s, have occupied more than
1,000 white commercial farms since February this year.
</P>
<P>
About 30 people, including white farmers and farm workers, have
so far been killed in political violence and farm occupation.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government has gazetted 804 farms for compulsory
 acquisition to resettle thousands of landless peasants.

CANBERRA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A conference of more than 50
chiefs in Nadi, Fiji, Thursday decided that the western half of
the country's main island will declare itself a confederacy, the
Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported.
</P>
<P>
The ABC said that the move to form a confederacy, the fourth in
the country, means the west is remaining within Fiji but seeking
increased representation.
</P>
<P>
The chiefs complained that their region is Fiji's wealth
producer, with sugar, tourism and the international airport, but
they have been damaged by the actions of the Fijian nationalists,
occupying parliament in Suva in the east, the ABC said.
</P>
<P>
The fijilive.com website reported that the declaration will be
made known to Fiji's Great Council of Chiefs and if rejected,
moves will be made to secede from the rest of Fiji.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also resolved that the military hand over power to
civilians and Vice President Ratu Josefa Iloilo be made president
of Fiji, the website said.

development of the Mekong Sub-region, and cooperation between the
ASEAN and countries in the Asia-Pacific region at their upcoming
meeting here next month, the Thai Foreign Ministry said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Don Pramudwinai said in a press

<HEADLINE> Manila Confident of OIC's Boycott to MILF's Separatism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
confident that the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) will
not grant observer status to the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (
MILF), a senior official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in a radio speech that
this was the assessment made by the Department of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
"The MILF was asking for two hours to bring their case before
the OIC but this has not yet been granted. Definitely, it looks
like the OIC would deny the MILF's request for observer status,"
Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
He said the OIC recognizes the Moro National Liberation Front (
MNLF), not the MILF, as the "sole and legitimate representative of
the Bangsa Moro people."
</P>
<P>
The official said some MILF leaders are now in Kuala Lumpur,
capital of Malaysia, to bring their case before the OIC, an
influential forum of more than 50 Muslim states.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, National Security Adviser Alexander Agurre said the
OIC has indicated that it will respect the Philippines'
sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a breakaway faction of the MNLF, is fighting for the
creation of a separate Islamic state in the war-torn Mindanao.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Still Favored Destination for Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines is still valued
destination for foreign businessmen and tourists despite the
problems in Mindanao and Metro Manila, the Philippine News Agency
(PNA) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The PNA quoted the Immigration Office as saying that there were
319,462 foreign and Filipino passengers who arrived in April and
323,111 in May compared to the 279,039 and 318,818, respectively,
who arrived in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
This means that there were 22,927 and 4,293 more passengers who
arrived from abroad in April and May, respectively, compared to
those who arrived in the same months in 1999, statistics issued by
the office showed recently.
</P>
<P>
Immigration Commissioner Rufus Rodriguez said that the increase
of arrivals was recorded from January to May this year despite the
escalation of conflict in Mindanao and the spate of bombings in
Metro Manila and other cities.
</P>
<P>
This should allay the fears that the Mindanao conflict has
scared away foreign investors and tourists from coming here or
resulted in their exodus from the country, he noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of dead seals are being
washed ashore on the Dagestani coast of the Caspian Sea daily, an
environment watchdog said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Seals started dying en masse in April, when hundreds of their
dead bodies were found each day on Kazakhstan's shore. By early
June, over 8,000 had died in the Kazakh sector of the Caspian Sea,
the Interfax news agency reported, quoting Akhmed Mungiyev,
director of the Dagestani Environment Monitoring Center.
</P>
<P>
The seals are believed to be poisoned by extremely high
concentration of mercury and cadmium in the Caspian waters The
cadmium content in areas where masses of seals died was 17 times
the maximum admissible concentration.
</P>
<P>
The poisoning undermined the seals' immune systems and caused
miscarriages among the female population, reducing the birth rate.
</P>
<P>
According to the Kazakh Ministry of Natural Resources and
Environmental Protection, the population of Caspian seals has
dropped by 20 percent in the past decade to only 420,000.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Senior Official Stresses Sino-Japanese Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 8 (Xinhua) -- China has always attached great
importance to developing ties with Japan and treasured the long-
standing neighborly friendship with the Japanese people, a senior
Chinese official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Qizheng, minister of the Information Office of China's
State Council, made the remarks while delivering a speech at a
symposium on the future of Asia, which opened here earlier in the
day.
</P>
<P>
"Viewing the history of Sino-Japanese relations, in spite of
the setbacks and unhappiness of the past, over the last 50 years,
the main trend has been good neighborly relations between the
peoples of the two countries," Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the hard-won Sino-Japanese relations to efforts
of the two peoples, far-sighted politicians of the two countries
and people from all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
"The friendly and cooperative relations between China and Japan
not only embody the friendship between the two peoples, but also
successfully display the healthy relations between the two
countries based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhao also said the two countries should further promote the
steady development of Sino-Japanese relations based on the basic
principle of "looking into the future while drawing lessons from
history."
</P>
<P>
On China's ties with Asian countries, Zhao said, "As a country
in Asia, China is greatly concerned about its economic relations
and friendship with other countries in Asia."
</P>
<P>
Noting that bilateral trade volume between China and other
Asian countries increased remarkably over the past 20 years, Zhao
said China has benefited from trade, while at the same time it has
greatly promoted the development of the Asian economy by providing
a large market for other Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
Talking about China's bid to join the World Trade Organization
(WTO), Zhao expressed the belief that China's opening-up will
reach a new level after its entry into the world trade body.
</P>
<P>
"Joining the WTO is an important embodiment of China's active
participation in economic globalization, and will inject new
vitality into the further development of economic globalization,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhao briefed the participants on China's great achievements
made in the past 20 years since the adoption of reform and opening
up policy.
</P>
<P>
To develop economy needs a peaceful international environment,
he said, adding that China, which has been devoted to world peace
and stability, will continue its efforts with other countries to
establish a new, just, reasonable and equal international order on
the basis of mutual-benefit.
</P>
<P>
The annual symposium, sixth of its kind, is sponsored by
Japan's leading economic daily, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun.
</P>
<P>
Asian leaders present at the two-day conference included
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and Singapore's Senior
Minister Lee Kuan Yew.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Aircraft Firm Delivers Tail Section to Boeing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Shenyang Aircraft Corporation
(SAC) today delivered a tail section of the new generation of
Boeing 737 airliner to the U.S. aircraft giant Boeing.
</P>
<P>
Under a contract signed in February 1995, SAC, a major aircraft
manufacturer based in Shenyang, capital of northeast China's
Liaoning Province, agreed to produce 1,000 tail sections for
Boeing planes, said Li Fangyong, SAC's chairman and president.
</P>
<P>
The tail section delivered today is the first made by China for
Boeing. It marks a milestone in the development of China's
aviation industry, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the tail section, made of over 3,000 components,
demands complicated processing and assembly technology.
</P>
<P>
In order to meet quality standards, SAC has invested 199
million yuan (about 23.9 million U.S. dollars) in technology
upgrading over the past five years, Li said.
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, SAC will deliver another seven tail sections
this year, a total of 50 next year and 14 per month in 2002,
Boeing China Inc. public relations director Thomas McLean told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Chinese senior government officials have attached great
importance to the tail section production and have inspected SAC
several times.
</P>
<P>
At today's roll-out ceremony, Fred Howard, president of Boeing
China Inc., said that SAC's improvement in manufacturing
capability enables the two companies to carry out closer
cooperation in the future.
</P>
<P>
Since the new generation of Boeing 737 went into operation in
1997, Boeing has received over 1,360 orders. The medium and short
range passenger plane is capable of carrying 110 to 189 passengers.
The model is popular in the international aircraft market.
</P>
<P>
There are so far some 4,000 Boeing 737 aircraft operational
worldwide. China has purchased 183 Boeing 737 passenger planes,
which are flying for 16 aviation companies.

<HEADLINE> Landslide-Relief Efforts at Yigong Lake Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NYINGCHI (TIBET), June 8 (Xinhua) -- A diversion canal dug
after a heavy landslide at Yigong Lake was put into use today.
</P>
<P>
Only a moderate amount of water is running into the canal and
is not likely to pose a threat to the lake's lower reaches, said a
local rescue official.
</P>
<P>
To prevent accidents, local residents and the majority of
disaster workers have been evacuated.
</P>
<P>
The landslide occurred on April 9 in Yigong Township of Bomi
County. The 300-million cubic meters of mud and rock temporarily
dammed the Yigong River, causing the water level in Yigong Lake to
rise sharply, destroying seven kilometers of highways, submerging
large tracts of cropland and tea plantations, and leaving more
than 4,000 local people homeless.
</P>
<P>
The local government immediately organized a rescue team,
which completed an 800-meter-long canal on June 4.

NINGBO, June 8 (Xinhua) -- China intends to promote electronic
business and use it to spur the national economy, an official with
the Ministry of Information Industry (MII) said today at a forum
in Ningbo, east China's Zhejiang province.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a trade fair in Zhejiang, Song Ling, director of
the department of information promotion of MII, said that E-
business will boost the national economy and upgrade people's
living standards.
</P>
<P>
However, China is still a newcomer to the E-commerce phenomenon,
Song said, noting that the world trade volume of E-business hit
145 billion US dollars last year, but China only took in 6.6
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
China is busy making policies for the information industry
related to taxes, patents, and information security, and will
carry out E-business trial operation in some areas, Song said.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 10 million Internet users, and the figure
is expected to double by the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> HK Draws up Strategy to Develop Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Tourism Commission of Hong
Kong published a booklet entitled "Hong Kong Tourism -- Expanding
the Horizons" Thursday, expatiating on the vision and strategy to
boost Hong Kong's tourism.
</P>
<P>
"Our Vision is an ambitious one: To establish and promote Hong
Kong as Asia's premier international city, a world-class
destination for leisure and business visitors," said Hong Kong
Commissioner for Tourism Mike Rowse at a press conference on the
publication of the booklet.
</P>
<P>
The strategy to achieve the vision includes positioning Hong
Kong as Asia's pre-eminent international and cosmopolitan city
with a unique blend of eastern and western heritage and culture,
distinct from other cities in China.
</P>
<P>
Making Hong Kong the preferred gateway to the region in general
and the Chinese mainland in particular and taking maximum
advantage of Hong Kong's strategic location at the heart of Asia
is also part of the strategy.
</P>
<P>
The booklet is a result of close cooperation between the Tourism
Commission and the Tourism Strategy Group, a body established in
August 1999 to offer advice to the Hong Kong government on the
future development of tourism from a strategic perspective, as
well as wide collection of public opinions, according to the
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
"Since the establishment of the Tourism Commission in May 1999,
we have made one of our main tasks the formulation of a Vision and
Strategy Statement to provide a framework for the long-term
development of tourism in Hong Kong," Rowse said.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 8 (Xinhua) -- China will promote its tourism in
2001 under the theme of "Health and Fitness Tour," said an
official of China's National Tourism Administration (NTA) here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"In the light of holding the World University Games-2001 and
the bid for the Olympic Games-2008, we choose the more attractive
and participatory sports activities from the grand international
and national events we held and introduce them to the outside
world," said Yang Wenzhen, director of NTA's Marketing and
Communications Department.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, such special tourism activities related to sports as
rock-climbing, mountaineering, desert-exploring, traveling by
bicycle, drifting and skiing will be staged to attract overseas
youths and the special tour fans, said Yang, who is here to attend
the 14th International Travel Expo Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
NTA has decided to present one special theme of tourism each
year from 2001 to 2005 so that the local tourism products and
their sales promotion can be well prepared in advance, said Yang.
</P>
<P>
The themes from 2002 to 2005 will respectively be FolkArts-
China, Culinary Kingdom-China, Catch the lifestyle-China and Visit
China -- the Third China Tourism Year.

<HEADLINE> ABM Treaty Cornerstone of Global Strategic Balance and Stability, Official (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese disarmament
official said here today that the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM)
treaty remains the cornerstone for global strategic balance and
stability.
</P>
<P>
Sha Zukang, director-general of the Department of Arms Control
and Disarmament under China's Foreign Ministry, told Xinhua in an
exclusive interview that revisions of the treaty will undermine
the global strategic balance and stability and seriously affect
international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Sha, an experienced Chinese diplomat in charge of arms control
and disarmament, said that China opposes any revision of the ABM
treaty.
</P>
<P>
"It is a clear and steadfast stand," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that the treaty, which restricts development and
deployment of any national ballistic missile defense system,
safeguards the relative strategic balance and stability among the
United States, Russia, and other nuclear powers.
</P>
<P>
Though the U.S. has said it wants to revise the ABM treaty to
protect itself from "missile threats" of the so-called rogue
states, Sha said the real reason for the U.S.' insistence on the
matter is that the country wants to develop its National Missile
Defense system and seek an absolute military advantage over the
rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
In his view, once the international strategic balance and
stability is destroyed, the global strategic structure will
definitely undergo major changes.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, the unilateral bent and military daring
of American foreign policy will become more prominent, and other
big powers will act in response, creating an even more
unpredictable international situation.

<HEADLINE> ABM Treaty Cornerstone of Global Strategic Balance and Stability: Official (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. recognizes the treaty's status as the cornerstone for
maintaining global strategic balance and stability and the
prerequisite of nuclear reduction of the U.S. and Russia, Sha
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In the joint statement following the U.S.-Russia summit meeting
days ago, Sha said, both sides reconfirmed the treaty has played
an indispensable role in the process of nuclear disarmament and
should be observed.
</P>
<P>
Any revision of the ABM treaty will seriously hinder nuclear
disarmament, Sha said. The U.S.' plan to develop the missile
defense system will greatly improve the capability of the U.S.
strategic nuclear facilities in both offensive and defense. The
National Missile Defense system will also serve as a kind of "
amplifier" to the U.S. offensive forces and nullify the progress
made in U.S.-Russia bilateral nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Russia has stated clearly that it will
withdraw a series of arms control agreements if the U.S. breaks
the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Should that happen, he said, the success of U.S.-Russia
bilateral nuclear disarmament will be ruined, and the multilateral
nuclear disarmament process will be hobbled as well.

<P>
The international non-proliferation efforts will be endangered
by the revision of the treaty as non-nuclear countries regard the
nuclear countries' commitment to nuclear disarmament as a pre-
condition that they will not seek to develop and possess nuclear
weapons, Sha continued.
</P>
<P>
He explained that if the nuclear disarmament process reaches a
stalemate, it will be hard to maintain the current global nuclear
non-proliferation system, and the basis of the international arms
control and non-proliferation system will be shaken.
</P>
<P>
If the U.S. succeeds in its attempt to revise the treaty, an
arms race in space would be inevitable, Sha said, stressing that
the U.S. views the missile defense system as an important part of
its plan to control space.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.S.' plan, part of its missile defense system will
be deployed in space and be targeted at space objects; and the
other part of the system will be based in space for providing
target and navigational information for ground weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
If the plan is carried out, space will become a new weapons
base and battlefield, he said, stressing that other big powers
will not sit and look on unconcerned.

<P>
He pointed out that the U.S., out of its selfishness, insists
that the treaty be revised will not only jeopardize world security,
but also seriously threaten its own best interests.
</P>
<P>
As far as revision of the treaty is concerned, he said that
China hopes the U.S. will, as the Chinese saying goes, "think well
before taking any action," and consider the strong reaction that
it will bring from the international community so as not to "life
a rock only to drop it on its own toes."
</P>
<P>
On the U.S. Theater Missile Defense system, Sha said that the
system jointly initiated by the U.S. and its allies in the Asia-
Pacific region goes far beyond the legitimate defense needs of
those countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that the system is not at all in line with the regional
security and stability, and will possibly generate a regional arms
race.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that China is adamantly opposed to attempts by
any country to include Taiwan in the Theater Missile Defense
system in any form.
</P>
<P>
Inclusion of Taiwan into such a system seriously infringes on
China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and is a gross
interference into China's internal affairs -- something that the
Chinese people will never allow, he said.

<HEADLINE> ECO to Reduce Tariff, Non-Tariff Barriers to Boost Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi announced on Thursday that the member states of the
Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) have agreed on starting to
reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers to boost trade within the
group.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the end of the 10th meeting of
the ECO Council of Ministers, Kharrazi said that the ECO council
has approved the proposal by senior experts of the member states to
reduce the barriers.
</P>
<P>
Without revealing details about the proposal, he said that the
agreement would be carried out after the approval of the ECO summit
to be held here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A regional economic group, the ECO was founded by Iran, Pakistan
and Turkey in 1985. It was joined by Afghanistan and the Central
Asian and Caucasian republics of Azerbaijan, Tajikistan,
Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan after the
collapse of former Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the trade volume among ECO countries only
constitutes 7 percent of their total trade, said Kharrazi who was
elected chairman of the ECO Council of Ministers for a two-year
term.
</P>
<P>
He said that the council also approved the formation of a
working group of senior officials to check out problems and hurdles
concerning trade among ECO members and find necessary solutions.
</P>
<P>
The ECO members can boost their cooperation in various fields,
particularly in transportation, communications, energy and
environmental protection, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that the ECO council also decided to reform the
structure of the ECO secretariat in order to improve its efficiency
and coordination among ECO states.
</P>
<P>
He announced that the council approved the election of his
advisor Abdolrahim Gavahi as the new secretary general of the
organization for a three-year term.
</P>
<P>
Gavahi, a former ambassador, currently serves as head of the
Center for International Economic Studies at the Institute for
Political and International Studies affiliated to the Iranian
Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial meeting was scheduled to be held for two days to
discuss the ECO budget for the year 2000, reports of the commerce
ministers' meeting held on March 2000 in Tehran and transportation
ministers meeting in April 2000 in Islamabad to prepare the 6th ECO
summit.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session on Thursday morning, Kharrazi
called on the ECO states to coordinate and harmonize their
legislation, economic and infrastructural systems.
</P>
<P>
With its coordinated and goal-oriented presence in other
regional and international forums and by sharing their experiences,
the ECO can take great strides forward to forge closer regional
cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ECO is facing some problems, such as the
absence of coordination and agreement on reduction of tariff and
non-tariff barriers, the absence of a mechanism for payments and
settlement of accounts among the members' banking institutions.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Police Release Hamas Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian police have released Sheikh
Ahmed Namr, one of the leaders of the Islamic Resistance Movement
Hamas, said Palestinian sources Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian security services arrested Namr last March following
a speech he delivered in one of the Khan Yunis mosques in which he
expressed support for the violent actions staged by its members in
the Israeli city of Taiba.
</P>
<P>
This was the eighth time Namr was arrested by the Palestinian
police.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Palestinian security services on Thursday
allowed Israeli security officers to visit Mohammed Daif, who was
accused by Israeli security services of being a terrorist and
arrested by the Palestinian police a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
Daif is a Hamas member and actively participated in many
terrorist attacks against Israeli targets, according to the Israeli
security services.
</P>
<P>
It is not known yet whether the Palestinian security service
will allow Israeli officers to interrogate Daif, who reportedly
surrendered to the Palestinian police for self-protection after his
name was put on the Israeli blacklist.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Islamic militant group Hamas has been engaged
in a holy war aimed at liberating all Palestinian territories
occupied by Israel in all previous Middle East wars. It had claimed
responsibilities for several deadly attacks on Israeli targets in
the past few years.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard and Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid declared
Thursday in Tokyo they would put past differences behind them.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported that the prime
minister and the president spent half an hour locked in talks
after slipping away from a reception for more than 80 world
leaders who attended the funeral of Japan's Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, Howard described the talks as "extremely positive"
and said he found President Wahid an "engaging and charming" man.
</P>
<P>
"There was very strong agreement between the two of us that the
relationship between Australia and Indonesia is very important to
both countries, that we were forever linked to each other in the
region, and that we would work together as leaders of our two
countries in improving and broadening the relationship," Howard
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Australia strongly supported Indonesia's territorial integrity,
" Howard reportedly said.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between the two countries was damaged after
Australia sent peacekeepers to East Timor last September and there
are analysts in Indonesia who have accused Australia of fueling
independence movements in Indonesia, and of sending
representatives to last week's meeting in Irian Jaya where
indigenous leaders voted to declare an independent state.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Accord State Funeral to Slain Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government on
Thursday decided to accord a state funeral to a senior minister
who was assassinated in a suicide bombing, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Industry Development C. V. Gunaratne was killed
Wednesday afternoon when he was leading a procession to collect
donations for the army in his constituency in southern suburb of
Colombo.
</P>
<P>
At least 21 others were also killed instantly in the bombing
which was blamed on the separatist rebels of Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983, have plotted a
string of similar attacks in the capital since December. President
Kumaratunga narrowly escaped assassination on December 18, but
lost her right eye.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Minister Gunaratne's wife Shyama Gunaratne succumbed
to her injuries Thursday afternoon at a hospital close to Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The government tightened security in and around Colombo
Thursday, and the usual flow of heavy traffic in Colombo had eased.
</P>
<P>
The police had rounded up about 60 persons for questioning from
the suburban areas.
</P>
<P>
It has been revealed that the suicide bomber had come with four
accomplices and the police have been quick to apprehend them.
</P>
<P>
Police said that the bomb used to kill the minister had
contained 1.5 kilos of plastic explosives and ball bearings.
</P>
<P>
Minister Gunaratne is the first People Alliance minister to be
assassinated by the LTTE. In 1997 another senior minister Nimal
Siripala de Silva escaped a LTTE assassination attempt in Jaffna.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Russia Splits NATO by Missile Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cohen made the remarks during his flight to Brussels for a NATO
defense ministers' meeting, according to an Associated Press (AP)
report.
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of vagueness involved in his proposal ... and
they have yet to become clear," Cohen told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"It could be a constructive proposal, but it could be simply a
tactic to divide the European members of NATO from the United
States," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think there has been an attempt over the last year or two to
divide the Europeans from NATO," the report quoted Cohen as saying.
</P>
<P>
The United States will decide whether to deploy a national
missile defense (NMD) system later in the year. Such a move would
violate the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty signed by Moscow
and Washington in 1972 and therefore Washington is persuading
Moscow to agree to modify the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Vladimir Putin, when meeting U.S. President
Clinton last week, has proposed working with NATO and Europe on a
joint anti-missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
The European members of the western alliance, fearing that the
U.S. project of NMD will decouple the alliance and may also result
in arms race with Russia, also oppose the project.
</P>
<P>
"We've made some headway with our allies, who I think were
initially either doubtful, skeptical or less enthusiastic about it,
but based on my presentations to them, many changed their mind,"
Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
"Now, I think we have more work to do in persuading them that
the system we have in mind would pose no threat to the Russians,"
Cohen added.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Workers on Strike Against Petrol Price Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Song Li
</P>
<P>
LAGOS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The streets in Lagos, Nigeria's
largest city, were deserted on Thursday when the nationwide "sit
at home" strike against a petrol price hike in the Africa's
largest oil-producing country kicked off.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria Labor Congress (NLC) called for the general strike
shortly after the Nigerian government increased the country's
petrol price by 50 percent to 30 naira (100 naira equals about one
U.S. dollar) per liter last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
All of the city's gas stations were closed and the petrol price
on the black market rocketed to almost three times.
</P>
<P>
A few cars still running on the streets bear the green signs
distributed beforehand by the strike organizers.
</P>
<P>
The Lagos State government has directed its personnel to stay
at home on Thursday to avoid trouble.
</P>
<P>
The state government warned in a statement that while the
government appreciates the need for labor to express its feelings
over the fuel price increase, it would not allow hoodlums to cause
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed security reports available to government indicate that
some unpatriotic elements have completed plans to exploit on-going
agitation by workers to cause trouble on a large scale in the
state thereby endangering lives and property," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The fuel crisis seemed to be worsening on Wednesday when some
state governors openly took sides with the protesters across the
country.
</P>
<P>
The governor of the southeastern Bayelsa State said in Yenagoa,
the state capital, that the increase was unfair to the masses,
adding that the issue was not discussed at last week's Federal
Executive Council meeting.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Sani, governor of the northern Zamfara State, which was
the first state in Nigeria to implement the controversial Islamic
law of Sharia, also criticized the hike as unjustifiable.
</P>
<P>
The country has seen an increasing violent demonstrations in
the past week. In the country's most developed southeastern
region, college students spearheaded the relatively peaceful
demonstrations, while in other areas, some protesters set up road
blocks and even clashed with the police.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo Tuesday convened an
emergency meeting with Nigeria Labor Congress, but failed to reach
a compromise.
</P>
<P>
NLC President Adams Oshiomhole said Wednesday that there would
be no going back on the strike if the Federal Government refused
to rescind the hike.

<HEADLINE> WFP Launches New Aid Appeal for Horn of Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Program (WFP) has launched a new appeal for the Horn of Africa for
emergency food aid on 13.4 million drought victims in five
countries who are hardest hit by drought.
</P>
<P>
A WFP news release available here Thursday said that the new
program is part of a wider U. N. appeal for aid by the Office for
the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs that covers Djibouti,
Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
In addition to WFP's previous requests to donors to fund its
operations in the Horn of Africa, the agency will need an
additional 489,000 tons of food at a cost of 298 million U.S.
dollars for this appeal.
</P>
<P>
WFP is also requesting donors to fund several logistics
operations, such as port and road rehabilitation, at a cost of
9.8 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Timely aid will mean the difference between life and death for
a large percentage of the population, most of whom are women and
children," said WFP Executive Director Catherine Bertini in New
York.
</P>
<P>
She said, "their families and communities have succumbed to
several vicious cycles of drought and instability. If relief aid
is late and inadequate, this humanitarian crisis can easily
become a human tragedy of historic proportions."
</P>
<P>
Bertini, appointed by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan as
special envoy for the drought in the Horn, travelled to the
region in mid-April to assess the needs of the victims and to
alert the world of the threat of famine.
</P>
<P>
The majority of those affected are in Ethiopia where 10 million
people are estimated to be at risk. Approximately 2.2 million are
without adequate food supplies in Kenya, 750,000 in Somalia,
335,000 in Eritrea and 150,000 in Djibouti.

<HEADLINE> Clash Between Ugandan, Rwandan Forces Pauses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The northeastern Congolese city of
Kisangani was calm on Thursday following three-day clashes between
Ugandan and Rwandan troops from Monday, Ugandan Army Spokesman
Phinehas Katirima said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) pounded the Uganda
People's Defence Forces (UPDF) positions three times last night
and occupied the Bangoka Airport on the outskirts of Kisangani
after the UPDF pulled out of it as part of an agreement between
the two armies to demilitarize the city.
</P>
<P>
The two former allies agreed recently to withdraw their troops
to 100 kilometers from Kisangani after they clashed in early May.
</P>
<P>
Uganda declared Wednesday to observe a unilateral 24-hour
ceasefire Thursday in Kisangani, the third largest city of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
"Uganda has agreed unilaterally to observe a 24-hour
ceasefire," James Wapakabulo, chairman of national coordination
committee on the region, told a press conference here wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is only possible provided U.N. Observer team
establishes presence on the UPDF side.
</P>
<P>
"In order to ensure that the ceasefire holds, the UPDF is
prepared to ignore sporadic shelling of its positions but only if
such shelling does not amount to preparation for ground attack,"
said Wapakabulo,
</P>
<P>
He said that Uganda reiterates its total commitment to the
Lusaka Peace Accord and other agreements.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda have their troops stationed in Kisangani
where they have backed rival rebel factions fighting against the
DRC President Laurent Kabila.

of the economic and financial crises hitting many areas of the
world.
</P>
<P>
The European Union accounted for 82.27 billion euros (78.4
billion dollars) or 52.5 percent of the total German exports from
January to March, 21.3 percent more than in the same period of
last year, the office said.
</P>
<P>
The biggest rise was reported in exports to Russia with 35.6
percent, followed by the United States with 30.2 percent. German

<P>
MOSCOW, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
Thursday expressed skepticism over the demand by Yugoslavia that U.
N. peacekeepers withdraw from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. pullout is not likely to promote settlement of the
problem in the Yugoslav province, Ivanov told a joint press
conference with visiting Albanian Foreign Minister Pascal Milo.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav cabinet approved a statement Wednesday demanding
the U.N. Security Council withdraw peacekeepers who "violate their
mandate, betray the trust given them" and "are responsible for the
ethnic genocide against Serbs and non-Albanians," according to
Reuters.
</P>
<P>
In a televised address, Yugoslav Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic
also demanded that the U.N. fire the chief U.N. administrator in
Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner of France, and revoke his decisions which
are "contrary to the Security Council resolution."
</P>
<P>
Ivanov echoed Belgrade's dissatisfaction with the performance
of the U.N. civilian mission in Kosovo but stressed U.N.
activities in Kosovo should not be questioned.
</P>
<P>
According to Yugoslav Deputy Foreign Minister Nebojsa Vujovic,
more than 1,000 people have died in more than 5,000 terrorist
attacks since NATO-led troops entered Kosovo on June 12.
</P>
<P>
"Some 350,000 Serbs and other non-Albanians have been
ethnically cleansed," he claimed.

<TEXT>
<P>
The victory was taken by some experts as signaling an all-out
renaissance of the country's once dominant middle- and long-
distance running dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Ma, who jumped to fame by guiding his protegees Liu Dong, Qu
Yunxia and Wang Junxia to three gold medals in the 1993 Stuttgart
world championships, saw his new-generation runners in the stand
cruise to victories.
</P>
<P>
Lan Lixin won the 1,500m in four minutes 22.90 seconds, well
outside her personal best of 3:53.97, which was world's eigth best-
ever result.
</P>
<P>
Li Jingnan finished second in 4:05.33 and Yin Lili, whose
personal best time is 3:53.91, was third in 4:07.25.
</P>
<P>
Seven of the world's top 10 best time were clocked by members
of the "Ma's Family Army", with the world record of 3:50.46 set by
Qu Yunxia in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The women's 10,000m was won by Li Ji in a time of 32:22.90.
</P>
<P>
Dong Yanmei, winner in the 5,000m here on Wednesday, trailed Li
for most of time and finished second in 32:23.21. Their teammate
Song Liqing took the third place in 32:38.90.
</P>
<P>
Dong emerged from almost nowhere at the National Games in 1997
to win the women's 1,500m event and broke the then world record of
5,000m event.
</P>
<P>
Her personal best time in the 10,000m of 30:38.09 stands fourth
in the world's all-time list.
</P>
<P>
The world record of 29:31.78 was also held by an elder teammate
Wang Junxia, winner of the event in the 1993 world championships
and gold medalist of the 5,000m event in the Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Ma was not satisfied with his runners'performance, but he
predicted that they will be mature in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
"They are very young and plagued with injuries," Ma said. "In
the next three months before the Olympic Games, we will train hard
and try not to let the Chinese people down."
</P>
<P>
In the day's other events, Li Lei broke the women's javelin
Asian record with a throw of 63.69 meters, which was the only
Asian record broken during two days' competition.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A lightweight robot that can scale
tall buildings and clean their exterior walls was put into use for
the first time in the Chinese capital of Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The 38-floor China World Trade Center was chosen as the first
work assignment for the mechanical maid, owned and operated by the
Beijing Bangjie Robot Automatic Cleaning Co..
</P>
<P>
Positioned on a sturdy cable, the remote-controlled robot can
move up or down nearly 30 floors at 2-10 meters per minute. Using
a vacuum hose, it removes grit and grime from the glass surface by
spraying liquid detergent and then sucking dirt.
</P>
<P>
Via a remote control, an on-ground, indoor operator navigated
the robot hard at work under the hot sun.
</P>
<P>
The small, efficient robot can do the work of four people,
according to its creators, a team led by Prof. Wang Yan with
Harbin Polytechnic University in northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Inspects Enterprises in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator said that
the state-owned enterprises will have great prospects once they
deepen reforms and build a modern enterprise system.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC), made the remarks during inspections to
the Dongfang Electronic Group Ltd. in Beijing early this month.
</P>
<P>
Li was informed that the group went from being a loss-maker to
a profit-earner after it built a modern enterprise system and
restructured its operations. It has been listed on the Shenzhen
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
During the inspection in Beijing on June 1-6, Li also visited
the Beijing Heavy Machinery Plant, the Electronic Company of the
Capital Iron &AMP; Steel Complex, and the Beijing Matsushita Color
Teletube Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing municipal government's policy on industry
restructuring is perfectly suited to its status as China's
political and cultural center, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be made to speed up changes in the services sector
and promote scientific and technological progress, he said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing is superior to other cities in its development of new
and high-tech industries, as it is a center of institutions of
higher learning, he added.
</P>
<P>
The system of the people's congress is a fundamental political
system of China, and strengthening the leadership of the Communist
Party of China is a guarantee for improving the system, Li noted.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: GEM Becomes Asia's Capital Formation Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Growth Enterprise Market (GEM)
, the Hong Kong counterpart of Nasdaq, has emerged as the most
successful capital formation center in the Asian region, with its
total market capitalization jumping up to over 7.4 billion U.S.
dollars in the six months since its launch last November.
</P>
<P>
GEM has raised more funds than any other second boards in the
region and attracted not only the home-grown companies but others
in China's mainland, Taiwan and the ASEAN region, said K. S. Lo,
chairman of the GEM Listing Committee when addressing the GEM
Conference 2000 here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that GEM raised 1.01 billion U.S. dollars in
three months up to the end of March this year, exceeding the
accumulated total of its other five Asian counterparts, including
KLSE 2nd Board, ROSE, SESDAQ, KOSDAQ and MOTHER.
</P>
<P>
"This has reinforced the status of Hong Kong as a pre-eminent
financial center in the region," Lo stressed.
</P>
<P>
The exchange first published its listing rules in last July,
and a total of 75 applications were received from domestic and
foreign companies in the 6 months since its launch, with 26
already listed.
</P>
<P>
So far, all the GEM companies have demonstrated a path to
profitability with 10 out of 17 companies in recent financial
reporting showing profit growth despite the recent market jitters
about the New Economy stocks worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"GEM is, of course, not immune from a much needed market
correction for picking the real winners," Lo said, adding that the
exchange will target growth companies, be this in the New, the Old
Economy, or the combined "clicks and mortars."
</P>
<P>
Participants to the conference predicted that capital, talents
and management will be the major challenges faced by New Economy
and technology start-ups. However, GEM provides a new window for
capital raising and talents, they said.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Tang, executive director of the Hong Kong Productivity
Council and organizer of the conference, said that while Hong Kong
has always had a large pool of venture capital, little of that has
found its way into IT companies, and "the GEM obviously fills an
urgent need."
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the future challenges GEM faces, Lo said the
exchange is a new market of emerging and more riskier nature and
it needs an economy of scale to attract different market
participants.
</P>
<P>
The marketing development issues and regulatory requirements
should be balanced and a strong analyst network to facilitate the
growth of the New Economy should be built up, Lo noted.
</P>
<P>
The conference with the theme of "A World of Opportunities for
Professionals and Growth Enterprises" was held to update local
companies on GEM's latest development. It was attended by more
than 200 entrepreneurs, professionals and senior executives of
growth enterprises.

<HEADLINE> China Ready to Expand Trade, Economic Cooperation With Africa: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- China is ready to expand trade and
economic cooperation with African countries in various forms, Vice-
Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) Sun
Guangxiang said here today.
</P>
<P>
Sun told the closing ceremony of a workshop for Chinese and
African economic officials, the fourth of its kind since 1998,
that China is highly interested in developing friendly and
cooperative relations with African countries.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people and the African people are both faced with
the task of developing their economies and raising the living
standards," Sun said. "The Chinese Government will, following the
principle of equality and mutual benefit and emphasizing actual
results, expand trade and economic cooperation with African
partners in various forms with the aim of seeking common
development."
</P>
<P>
The current workshop, initiated by Chinese President Jiang
Zemin, demonstrates the wish of the Chinese Government and people
to strengthen friendship and to seek common economic development
with African countries, Sun added.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China and Africa cooperate in trade, investment,
economic and technological areas and contracting labor services.
Two-way trade between China and Africa reached 6.48 billion U.S.
dollars in 1999, up 17.2 percent from a year earlier. The trade
volume topped 2.218 billion U.S. dollars in the first quarter this
year, up 71.7 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Chinese firms invested a total of 130 million U.S. dollars in
Africa last year.
</P>
<P>
China will host a China-African Cooperation Forum, a
ministerial-level meeting, here in October. Sun said that forum
will provide a tremendous opportunity for the two sides to
increase trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
A total of 28 economic officials from 15 African countries
attended the workshop, which was opened on April 11. They were
briefed on China's experiences in reforms and opening to the
outside world, and visited Shanghai, Shenzhen in coastal China as
well as Sichuan and Qinghai provinces in southwest and northwest
China.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Missile System Undermines Global Security: Senior Disarmament Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese disarmament
official said today that the development of an anti-missile system
will lead to the deterioration of international security and
undermine the security of other countries, including China.
</P>
<P>
Sha Zukang, director-general of the Department of Arms Control &AMP;
Disarmament with China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, made the
remarks in an exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
On China's nuclear policy, Sha said China possesses a small
arsenal of nuclear weapons in the specific historical context and
the purpose is solely for national defense.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has exercised considerable restraint in
developing nuclear weapons, stressing that China has never engaged
and will not engage itself in a nuclear arms race.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that certain hegemonistic countries are actively
involved in power politics, and blatantly developing missile
defense systems that destroy the international strategic stability,
in a bid to acquire a total strategic advantage.
</P>
<P>
Such acts will lead to the deterioration of international
security and do harm to the security of other countries, including
China, Sha pointed out.
</P>
<P>
China will have to reconsider its security and national defense
needs in light of this reality, Sha said.

<HEADLINE> Efforts Intensified to Save Bird Paradise in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Ministry of Environment has
launched a series of activities to save the Manyas Bird Paradise in
western Turkey from environmental pollution and to keep the
ecologic balance in the country's Marmara region.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's Environment Protection Director Serap Kuleli told
reporters that the European Protection Union supports the "Life
Project" which will be implemented in Manyas lake, in Balikesir
province on the coast of the Marmara Sea, reported Anatolia News
Agency on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A "Marshy Lands Administration Plan" has been drawn up to this
end for the first time in Turkey, said the official.
</P>
<P>
As part of the project, works on lake water analysis will be
completed by the end of the year and a land protection program will
follow, Kuleli explained.
</P>
<P>
She said that efforts are also being made to plant more trees in
the area and to revitalize tourist activities in connection with
the Bird Observation Tower.
</P>
<P>
Turkey also intends to turn the area into an "aqua products
center," similar to the one in southern France, said Kuleli.
</P>
<P>
Lake Manyas, also a national park, is an ornithological site
where 239 different species of birds flourish. Every year, over 3
million birds fly through this preserve, which is being threatened
by pollution originating from the nearby industrial area.

<HEADLINE> Negotiators Holds Secret Talks on Jerusalem: Radio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli and Palestinian
negotiation teams for the so-called back-channel talks had been
holding "private conversations" in the past few days on the status
of Jerusalem, Israel's Army Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The teams, led respectively by Israeli Public Security Minister
Shlomo Ben-Ami and Palestinian Legislative Council Speaker Ahmed
Qurei, had reached an initial agreement on the Israeli troops'
withdrawal from two more villages near Jerusalem, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
Both villages -- Beit Hanina, which is under Israeli security
and Palestinian civilian control, and Shuafat, which is under sole
Israeli control -- lie north of Jerusalem and south of the West
Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Israeli cabinet and Knesset (parliament), under the push of
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, approved the transfer of three
Arab villages, Abu Dis, Azariya, and Swahara, on the outskirts of
Jerusalem to the Palestinians full control last month.
</P>
<P>
But the handover had been shelved because of the bloody clashes
in mid-May between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian demonstrators
who urged Israel to release more Palestinian security prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The fate of Jerusalem, as well as the return of Palestinian
refugees, the status of Jewish settlements, water, border and
security, are the most thorny final-status issues on the
negotiation table between Israel and the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
Israel claims Jerusalem as its "eternal and undivided capital,"
while the Palestinians want at least the Arab East Jerusalem to be
the capital for its future independent state.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Barak's office after Sunday's cabinet
meeting claimed that the prime minister had ordered Israeli
negotiators not to discuss the Jerusalem issue with their
Palestinian counterparts in any talks.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear so far whether the "private conversations"
between Ben-Ami and Qurei, who had cooperated in talks in the
Swedish capital of Stockholm in the past few months, had got
specific or tacit approval by Barak.
</P>
<P>
The two negotiation teams are scheduled to go to Washington on
Monday and resumed their talks there on a framework deal to pave
the way for an agreement on the final-status issues by September
13.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Jerusalem's top Muslim leader Mufti
Ikrima Sabri said Thursday that he would not accept any Israeli-
Palestinian peace treaty if it did not make East Jerusalem the
capital of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
"(There will be) no solution without Jerusalem being the capital
of the Palestinian state," Sabri stated.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Beefs Up Security as Assassination Probe Underway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka Thursday beefed up
security in and around Colombo following a suicide bombing which
killed a key minister on Wednesday in the capital's southern
suburb.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police are continuing to question four men detained
after the bombing in Ratmalana about possible links with the
separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which was
blamed for the assassination.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Industry Development C. V. Gunaratne was killed in
Wednesday's bombing, which took place when he was leading a
procession to collect donations for the army in his constituency.
More than 20 others were injured in the incident.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman here said, "It is believed that the suicide
bomber was carrying about 1.5 kilos of plastic explosives."
</P>
<P>
Soldiers were deployed in Ratmalana to guard key junctions
although a curfew imposed in the area had been lifted on Thursday
as tensions eased.
</P>
<P>
Police have asked all ministers to stay away from public
gatherings to prevent any further attacks.
</P>
<P>
Navy gunboats are reported to have been deployed to prevent a
possible rebel assault from the sea.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's attack coincided with the country's first War
Heroes' Day, aimed at boosting the morale of troops battling the
LTTE rebels in the northern Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983, have over the
past two months engaged in a ferocious assault in a bid to retake
their former stronghold of Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
They have plotted a string of similar bomb attacks in the
capital since December. President Kumaratunga narrowly escaped
assassination on December 18, but lost her right eye.
</P>
<P>
The state media Thursday repeated government calls for people
to remain calm and warned that anyone instigating a backlash
against minority Tamils would be severely punished.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga said the LTTE rebels were trying to
create a backlash against minority Tamils in a bid to drive a
wedge between the two communities.
</P>
<P>
"Only the LTTE stands to gain if we fall prey to its attempts
to inflame communal passions by provoking the people in the south,
" Kumaratunga said in a statement while expressing condolence to
Minister Gunaratne's family.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the government is planning a state funeral for
the minister at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The attack has been widely condemned both within Sri Lanka and
by the international community.
</P>
<P>
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan called it "senseless."
</P>
<P>
A White House spokesman described the bombing as a "
reprehensible act," but said efforts to resolve the conflict in
Sri Lanka should continue.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Office Minister Peter Hain described the
bombing as "an atrocious act."

<HEADLINE> Chadian President Hails World Bank Decision to Finance Oil Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Chadian President Idriss Deby
Wednesday hailed the decision by the World Bank to finance the oil
development project of his country as "the second most important
event in the country's history after independence."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the daily Le Figaro, Deby said "the first
stone" of the oil project, which includes the opening of 300 oil
wells and the construction of a pipeline, will be laid in October
or November after the rainy season.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank decided Tuesday to finance the project with 3.7
billion U.S. dollars including 1.5 billion dollars to be invested
in the oil field and 2.2 billion for the 1,060-kilometer pipeline
running from Chad to Cameroun.
</P>
<P>
Deby said the oil project is aimed at fighting poverty and the
income from oil export will be used in health, education, rural
development and infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
He rejected the demand by some international non-governmental
groups to impose an international control over the use of the oil
revenues.
</P>
<P>
"National sovereignty is not merchandise. The judicial
instruments we put into place are sufficient," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. oil group Shevron and the Malaysian group Petronas
will be technically in charge of the oil project after the French
oil giant Elf-Aquitaine and the Dutch-British Shell pulled out of
the project last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Central Bank (ECB) on
Thursday raised its benchmark lending rate by half a percentage
point to 4.25 percent from 3.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth rate raising this year after three hikes in
February, March and April respectively.
</P>
<P>
The governing board of the ECB also raised the marginal lending
rate to 5.25 percent from 4.75 percent and the deposit rate to 3.
25 percent from 2.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
After the U.S. Federal Reserve raised American interest rates
by half a percentage point on May 16, the ECB was under heavy
pressure to increase the rates.
</P>
<P>
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
has estimated that the economic growth of the 11-nation euro zone
will reach 3.5 percent this year, a record high in ten years.

<HEADLINE> Russian Commander Wounded in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A Russian commander was gravely
wounded Thursday in Chechnya on Thursday as federal troops
continued their strikes on the rebels in the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
Police Colonel Valery Konovalov, deputy commander of the
western army grouping, sustained head wounds near a checkpoint on
the road linking Urus-Martan and Gekhi road when the car he was
riding came under fire. His driver was killed, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
There have been mounting rebel attacks on federal targets in
Chechnya recently. On Wednesday, two Russian elite OMON police
officers died and five others wounded when two suicide bombers
drove an explosive-laden truck at top speed and hit a building
housing an OMON unit in Alkhan-Yurt.
</P>
<P>
In another incident Thursday, one Russian soldier was killed
and two others wounded when a remote-controlled landmine blew up
their armored vehicle on the road connecting Urus-Martan and
Roshni-Chu, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
During the week that started on June 2, 15 federal servicemen
were killed and 77 wounded in Chechnya, according to Valery
Manilov, first deputy chief of the General Staff.
</P>
<P>
He told the press Thursday that 2,357 servicemen were killed
and 6,888 wounded since the beginning of the anti-terrorist
operation in the North Caucasus on August 2, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, federal aircraft unleashed more raids on rebel
positions in southern Chechnya over the past 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four rebels were killed and two others captured in the
past day in Nozhai-Yurt, Vedeno and Kurchaloi districts, Interfax
said, quoting the headquarters of the combined federal force in
the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had an extended meeting
Wednesday in the Kremlin with Deputy Prime Minister Nikolai
Koshman, the federal envoy to Chechnya, issued a decree Thursday
on organizing provisional executive authorities in the province.
</P>
<P>
The decree represented an effective introduction of direct
presidential rule in Chechnya, said Sergei Ivanov, secretary of
the Russian Security Council.
</P>
<P>
A bill to this effect has been sent to the State Duma lower
house of parliament, and once passed, it would be more legally
accurate to say that federal rather than presidential rule is in
force in Chechnya, Interfax quoted Ivanov as saying.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading U.S. Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are the major news
items in leading newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- A federal judge Wednesday "reluctantly" ordered Microsoft
Corp. split in two, declaring the software giant an "untrustworthy
" monopoly that refuses to abandon illegal business practices that
crush competitors and harm consumers. Microsoft immediately asked
the judge to delay any restrictions on its business and will seek
to have the judge's order overturned.
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Ehud Barak's governing coalition crumbled
Wednesday as right-wing and religious parties broke with the
Israeli leader and, in a preliminary ballot, voted to dissolve
parliament and hold new elections.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Clinton administration forcibly repatriated a prominent
player on Cuba's national baseball team, Andy Morales, who had
tried to enter the United States by sea. Officials said Morales
had failed to make the case that he faced persecution if returned
to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
-- An antimissile laser destroyed an armed Katyusha rocket in
flight during a test in New Mexico, the U.S. Army said. The
development moves the laser a step closer to possible deployment
along Israel's border with Lebanon, to defend Israel against
guerrilla rocket attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- AT&AMP;T deferred a plan to raise consumer long-distance rates
up to 80 percent. News of the plan had sparked an outcry.
Separately, the company will test how to give cable-TV customers
access to multiple Web-service providers.
</P>
<P>
-- The House voted 367-58 for a Pentagon bill adding billions
of dollars for the military and moved toward a vote on one
slashing domestic funds to levels that discomfit even Senate
Republicans. Clinton shows no sign of giving in even as his term
ticks down. Meanwhile, the Senate voted 51-47 to bar deep
unilateral nuclear-arms cuts until the next administration.

<HEADLINE> No Hiding for EPO Cheats in Tour de France: Doping Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The head of the French National Anti-
Doping Laboratory, which claims to have found a method of
detecting performance-improving drug EPO guaranteed on Thursday
that there would be no hiding for doping cheats during next month'
s Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
Jacques de Ceaurriz, director of the laboratory, said that the
accurate test for detecting the drug during long-haul races was
ready for the July 1-23 Tour.
</P>
<P>
"No cyclist will be able to cheat or hide the use of
erythropoietine (EPO)," de Ceaurriz told French radio.
</P>
<P>
"We can detect the use of EPO up to three days after its use.
The test is quite sophisticated. We need 48 to 72 hours to get
the results but our labs can analyse 80 samples a week," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope this year's Tour de France will be the cleanest ever
as far as doping is concerned. We can never completetly
extinguish the use of drugs but we hope to avoid its use on a
global scale," he added.
</P>
<P>
EPO causes the body to create more blood cells, thus bringing
more oxygen to muscles and enabling them to work longer and harder.
</P>
<P>
Sports experts say it can boost performance by 10 percent and
more, but at a risk of heart failure. Since it started being used
by athletes in the 1980s, 26 cyclists and several elite athletes
have died in suspicious circumstances.

<HEADLINE> 14th Hong Kong Int'l Travel Expo Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The 14th International Travel
Expo Hong Kong (ITE HK 2000) opened Thursday, drawing nearly 500
exhibitors from over 40 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is proud to host this prestigious event which
provides a good opportunity for members of the travel trade to
meet and exchange information on the latest developments in
tourism," said Hong Kong Commissioner for Tourism Mike Rowse at
the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The Expo is part of the efforts of Hong Kong to position itself
as the Events Capital of Asia, Rowse said.
</P>
<P>
"We all know that competition for visitors throughout the
region is fierce and we must continually upgrade our tourism
products to meet the challenge head on," he said.
</P>
<P>
On-line travel and golf holiday are the two new themes in this
year's Expo.
</P>
<P>
During the four-day event, a number of travel-related websites
will help the public to get instant travel information, design
personal tours and plan the budget. Some exhibitors will also
demonstrate the latest online hotel and air ticket reservation
services and introduce various system software for e-commerce
tailored for hotels, travel agents, airlines and other related
industry.
</P>
<P>
Tourism has contributed a great deal to Hong Kong's prosperity.
In 1999, Hong Kong received some 10.7 million visitors,
representing an increase of 11.5 percent over 1998. The city's
total tourism revenue last year amounted to 6.8 billion U.S.
dollars, accounting for about 4 percent of its gross domestic
product.

<HEADLINE> HK Government Supports Local IT Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government is
committed to supporting the development of the local information
technology (IT) industry by offering more business opportunities
to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Lau Kam-hung, director of information technology services of
Hong Kong, made the remarks when he delivered a speech at the Bi-
monthly Seminar on E-commerce for Small and Medium Enterprises
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The IT professionals and practitioners also met senior staff
members of the Information Technology Services Department (ITSD)
of Hong Kong in a gathering entitled "ITSD Networking Hour"
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The event was one of the regular functions organized by ITSD to
maintain close contact and communication with the local IT
industry.
</P>
<P>
Outsourcing of government IT services is one way in which the
Government is helping the local IT industry, Lau said. Another is
by publishing information on IT projects and tenders on the
government web site to facilitate potential suppliers in bidding
for the projects.
</P>
<P>
Apart from facilitating and promoting the development of the
local IT industry, the government also finances technology
development projects and researches undertaken by the industry and
academia through various funding schemes, such as the Innovation
and Technology Fund.
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we organized a Tripartite Forum to bring the IT
industry, the venture capital industry and academic researchers
together to promote the commercialization of IT research results,"
Lau said.
</P>
<P>
"This year, we will again organize this meaningful event which
will be held on June 29," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Meretz Party Rules out Giving up Education Portfolio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Education Minister Yossi
Sarid, leader of the left-wing Meretz Party, said on Thursday that
there is no possibility that Meretz will give up the education
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Sarid said he is in the
government only because he is serving as the education minister. He
also said there are very few parties truly interested in early
election.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks amid reports that Prime Minister Ehud Barak
plans to form a new government in replacement of the current one
which includes the ultra-Orthodox religous Shas party which on
Wednesday voted for a bill on dissolution of the Knesset
(parliament).
</P>
<P>
Sources close to Barak said the prime minster prefers a majority
government to a narrow one without the current ruling partners of
Shas, the National Religious Party and the Yisrael Ba'aliya, all of
which cast favorable votes for the bill calling for early
parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
But, said the sources, Barak will demand the parties to withdraw
their support for the bill in the future readings. It takes three
other readings for the bill to become law.
</P>
<P>
The 120-member Knesset passed a bill proposed by Knesset member
Avigdor Lieberman from Yisrael Beiteinu in a preliminary reading on
Wednesday, plunging Barak's One-Israel-led coalition into a crisis.
</P>
<P>
Shas, the third largest party in the nation and the No. 2 ruling
partner in the coalition with 17 seats in the Knesset, played a
decisive role in the voting.
</P>
<P>
Shas' religious education system is in deep debt due to its poor
management over the past few years. Education Minister Sarid
refused to allocate millions of dollars of additional funds to that
system as Shas demanded until it improves its management and fires
corrupt officials.
</P>
<P>
Shas wants Barak to order Sarid to provide the money. For
months, Barak has invested enormous time and energy in efforts to
settle the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between the prime minister and the Shas leadership took
a rapid turn for the worse on Monday when Shas threatened to vote
for Lieberman's bill if its demand for fund allocations is not met.
</P>
<P>
In response to the threats, Barak ordered officials from the
finance and education Ministries to suspend their talks with Shas
over the funding, saying he is not going to conduct negotiations
under threats, even if the threats are implicit.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that Sarid's determination to retain the
education portfolio may be interpreted as a signal that the left-
wing Meretz will not easily bend to Shas' demand.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who has been endeavoring, but in vain, to end the Shas-
Meretz crisis, may find it a herculean task to keep the
irreconcilable ruling partners peacefully within the same band.

GAZA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb
Erekat said on Thursday the Washington talks slated for next week
between the Palestinian and Israeli sides will discuss interim and
final-status issues in a parallel way.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Voice of Palestine radio, Erekat also
expressed worry over the current crisis inside the Israeli
coalition government, hoping such a crisis should not affect the
Palestinian-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
Erekat, who is leading the transitional negotiations, and his
Israeli counterpart Oded Eran held talks Wednesday night to pave
the way for the issues of the final status to be discussed in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
The final-status negotiations, led by Palestinian Council
Speaker Ahmed Qurei (Abu Ala) and Israeli Public Security Minister
Shlomo Ben-Ami, focus on the most thorny issues including the fate
of Jerusalem, borders, Palestinian refugees and Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli army radio said Thursday morning that Qurei
and Ben-Ami held secret talks in recent weeks on the status of
Jerusalem, adding the Israeli side is preparing to hand over two
more villages near Jerusalem to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israel claims Jerusalem as its "eternal and undivided capital,"
while the Palestinians want at least East Jerusalem to be the
capital for its future independent state.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Barak's office after last Sunday's cabinet
meeting claimed that the prime minister had ordered Israeli
negotiators not to discuss the Jerusalem issue with their
Palestinian counterparts in any talks for the time being.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear immediately whether the "private conversations"
between Ben-Ami and Qurei, who cooperated in talks in the Swedish
Capital of Stockholm in the past few months, had got specific or
tacit approval by Barak.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Fears EU Members to Follow U.S. Into Troubled Southeast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is vague about the
establishment of a U.S.-sponsored business bureau in a Kurdish-
populated province, as it is worried that European countries might
follow suit and raise human rights issues in the Kurdish areas, a
Turkish official has said.
</P>
<P>
Ankara has no problem of trust with the United States, which is
believed to be merely seeking business opportunities in Diyarbakir
Province, Turkish Daily News quoted on Thursday the Turkish
official as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkey fears it might find itself in a dilemma if it
issues the same sort of permissions to some European countries that
may use it for "different purposes," the official added.
</P>
<P>
While the U.S. Embassy to Ankara has declared that the bureau
will be opened on June 15, Ankara made it clear that without
signing a protocol permitting the opening of such an office, it is
impossible for the U.S. side to start work in Diyarbakir.
</P>
<P>
Washington has played down the function of the bureau.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Embassy spokesman said the bureau will not be an American
diplomatic mission, but a business facility affiliated to Turkey's
Southeastern Anatolian Industrialists and Businessmen's Association
(GUNSIAD).
</P>
<P>
Ankara has proposed that the bureau be opened with the Turkish
Union of Chambers and Commodities Exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is very sensitive about its southeastern regions, where
it has imposed an emergency law since 1984 after the outlawed
Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) launched an armed struggle for an
independent Kurdish state.
</P>
<P>
Ankara has deep-rooted suspicions toward some European Union
(EU) countries over the issue as they have always been critical of
its treatment of the Kurdish minority group, particularly in the
Kurdish-populated southeastern region.
</P>
<P>
The distrust was highlighted during the PKK leader Abdullah
Ocalan's stay in Italy last year. Italy, as well as Germany, turned
down Ankara's request to extradite the separatist chieftain, whom
Ankara had been pursuing for years.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. has supported Turkey in the crackdown on the
PKK from the very beginning, and has asked its European allies to
extradite Ocalan to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was captured early last year in Kenya by Turkish special
agents and was sentenced by Turkish court to death. But Turkey is
waiting for a decision by the European Court of Human Rights'
(ECHR) to decide whether or not to carry out the capital
punishment.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Records 1.6 Bln Dollars Trade Deficit in 11 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan incurred a trade deficit
of 1.61 billion U.S. dollars during the first 11 months of the
fiscal year 1999-2000, showing an increase of 17.5 percent over
the same period of the previous year, according to newly released
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
This deterioration of the trade gap occurred despite the fact
that there was an improvement of 10.3 percent in exports during
the period.
</P>
<P>
The imports recorded a faster growth rate of 11.5 percent over
the corresponding period in 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
By the end of May, Pakistan's exports totaled 7.69 billion
dollars as against imports worth 9.30 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In absolute terms, trade deficit showed a difference of 239
million dollars over 1.37 billion dollars recorded in July-May of
1998-99.
</P>
<P>
The statistics further showed that the monthly average of
exports and imports in the current financial year came to 699
million dollars and 845 million dollars, respectively.
</P>
<P>
At this rate, it is expected that the export figure for the
year 1999-2000 would be around 8.39 billion dollars and import
figure at 10.15 billion dollars while trade deficit amounting to 1.
76 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Mozambican Poverty Reduction Strategy Yields Notable Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique has made much progress in
 eradicating the extreme poverty since peace prevailed in the
southern African country in 1992 when the government started
implementing a development strategy conforming to its own
situations.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics released by the government
recently, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has increased by 7.5
percent annually in the past five years, with the per capita
income rising to 240 U.S. dollars last year from 145 dollars in
1995.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year civil war since independence in 1975 had left
Mozambique with a collapsed national economy, with a shortfall of
1.5 million tons of food each year. Half of its budget
expenditure depended on foreign aid and per capita income
registered less than 50 dollars. It was listed by the United
Nations as one of the lease developed countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
The effective strategy worked out by the new government led by
President Joaquim Chissano who won the first multi-party election
in 1994 healed the wounds of war gradually and put the economy on
the track of fast growth.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique, unlike some other mineral-rich African states, gave
 development priority to agriculture to overcome food shortage.
</P>
<P>
The sowing area has risen by 20 percent in the past five years,
while the main crop maize was more than self-sufficient in 1998.
As a result, grain shortfall was reduced to 200,000 tons in 1999.
</P>
<P>
All these achievements were scored through raising the purchase
prices of farm products, timely provision of seeds, farm tools and
chemical fertilizer as well as rehabilitation of destructed
irrigation facilities.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the government tried to develop the traditional cash
crops such as cotton and sugar cane by attracting over 100 million
dollars of investment from Mauritius to restore sugar plants and
open large-scale sugar cane plantation.
</P>
<P>
The government also took advantage of the country's long coast
and many fine natural harbors chosen by the landlocked neighboring
countries as their outlets, and work out a plan to develop mine
and industry sector, agriculture and tourism through the
construction of communication facilities along three corridors --
Maputo in the south, Beila in the middle and Nacala in the
northern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Maputo corridor project linking the Indian Ocean port of
Maputo to South African industrial center of Johannesburg started
in 1996 to renovate and build railway, highway and
telecommunication networks as well as expanding port handling
capacity.
</P>
<P>
An expressway from Maputo to Witbank, South Africa is expected
to be opened to traffic within this year. The infrastructure
improvement resulted in several foreign companies to invest 1.34
billion dollars in the construction of Mozambique Aluminium plant
which has an annual production capacity of 245,000 tons. The plant
will go into operation next year in the corridor.
</P>
<P>
The American Enron company also planned to invest two billion
dollars to build a large iron and steel works in Maputo.
</P>
<P>
The Beila corridor is designed to connect the central port of
Beila with Zimbabwe and further with Botswana, Zambia and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo while the Nacala corridor is
aimed at providing Malawi with an outlet while promoting the
development of the poorest northern region in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
However, the projects of Beila and Nacala corridors are still
on the paper as the neighboring countries cannot afford the dear
cost.
</P>
<P>
The government's plan to revive the export-oriented cash crop
production achieved little success due to low prices in the world
market.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the vigorous exploitation in the southern Maputo
region could possibly widen the gap which existed between the
north and the south.
</P>
<P>
Though Mozambique met difficulties in implementing the poverty
reduction strategy, the government remained confident of the
prospects of the strategy.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi said repeatedly that
the corridor development projects and those enterprises under
construction would sustain the future development of the national
economy, and that the Mozambican economy was expected to be more
vigorous as the southern African economic integration process
continued to deepen.

<HEADLINE> Greek PM Condemns Killing of British Defense Attache </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
Thursday condemned the killing of Stephen Saunders, Britain's
defense attache in Athens who was shot dead by two unidentified
gunmen as he was driving alone to work.
</P>
<P>
Saunders died after he was sent to a Red Cross hospital in
Athens.
</P>
<P>
"This terrorist act is contrary to the fundamental rule of
social coexistence and respect for human life," Simitis said in a
statement released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Greek government will fight terrorism by
every means, not allowing the country's international image to be
tarnished.
</P>
<P>
Costas Mitsotakis, former Greek prime minister and honorary
president of the New Democracy (ND), said the attack has put
Greece in an awkward position vis-a-vis the United States and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to take measures to reform its anti-
terrorism legislation and cooperate with other countries in
combating terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Recently, a report from U.S. Congress blamed Greece for not
fully cooperating in dealing with terrorism and called for
sanctions against Greece.
</P>
<P>
With more pressure from the United States, Greece has drafted a
memorandum on cooperation between the Greek and U.S. police,
without a specific day to sign it.
</P>
<P>
Although there is no claim of responsibility for the attack,
the Greek police and public order ministry officials believed that
the method and weapons pointed to the November 17, a terrorist
group in Greece.
</P>
<P>
The group killed U.S. Navy Capt. George Tsantes and his driver
in 1983 and killed Greek industrialist Alexandros Athanassiadis in
1988. Though it had claimed responsibility for bomb attacks
against British banks and other sites, it was the first time for
the terrorist group to target a British national.
</P>
<P>
Police have launched a manhunt, setting up roadblocks all over
the capital and sending out scores of plainclothes officers to
search for the attackers.

<HEADLINE> Former Australian PM on China's Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The development of China's
economy will have significant impact on the economic development
of other nations, former Australian prime minister Robert Hawke
made the remark here today while attending an international
symposium on development of the western part of China.
</P>
<P>
Hawke said that China has made remarkable achievements since
adopting the policy of opening to the outside in 1978, adding that
China's gross domestic product increased more than four-fold
during the period.
</P>
<P>
China is now the seventh largest economy in the world exceeded
only by the United States, Japan, Germany, France, the United
Kingdom, and Italy, said Hawke.
</P>
<P>
"Over this 22-year period, China has experienced average annual
economic growth rates of 8-9 percent, a performance never before
achieved by any other country," Hawke added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Chinese people were not the sole
beneficiaries of this remarkable performance.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1990s when Japan, the United States and Europe
took the major industrial economies into the deepest recession
since the Second World War, China's rapid growth was an important
element in sustaining the dynamic performance of East Asia, Hawke
said.
</P>
<P>
"The region again benefited from sound macro-economic policy of
China after the Asian financial crisis in 1997," he added.
</P>
<P>
China had engineered a remarkable soft-landing. Demand for
imports from the region was kept up and China did not seek to
match the region's competitive advantage, that flowed from the
collapse of their currencies, by devaluing the country's currency
RMB, Hawke said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that China's process of reform initiated by Deng
Xiaoping is "irreversible". But the current and future steps of
reform will be more difficult, he said.
</P>
<P>
So, "it is more important that the rest of the world should be
understanding of, and cooperative with, the Chinese leadership as
it faces these challenges that the pursuit of reform posed for it,
" said Hawke.
</P>
<P>
The three-day symposium, which opened today in Chongqing in
southwest China, was attended by about 100 experts and scholars
from the United States, Britain, Russia, Japan, France, Germany,
Australia, and Canada

<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Intellectual Property
Right Bureau was officially founded here today.
</P>
<P>
The aim of establishing the bureau is to meet the needs of

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- With a growing population and rapid
economic development, China is facing a water shortage that
threatens to bottleneck its urban development, experts with the
Ministry of Water Resources said.
</P>
<P>
The country will experience its most serious water shortage
after 2010, they warned.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry statistics, China will need 698.8
billion cubic meters of water in 2010, while the water supply is
only 667 billion cubic meters, leaving a gap of 31.8 billion cubic
meters.
</P>
<P>
The situation will worsen in 2030, with the gap widening to 50
billion cubic meters, experts said.
</P>
<P>
"The 21st century is the key period for China to realize its
modernization, and water scarcity will constitute a threat to the
country's sustainable development," said Zhang Jiatuan, a senior
water conservancy engineer at the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Related departments and localities should take immediate
measures to curb the worsening situation, he urged.

<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A National Economic and Trade Fair
for Chinese Township Enterprises will be held in Shangqiu city in
central China's Henan Province from September 6 to 9.

<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, Chairman of China's
National People's Congress Standing Committee, met here today with
visiting Moldova President Petru Lucinschi.
</P>
<P>
The current visit by Lucinschi is a major event in Sino-Moldova
relations which will surely have a far-reaching influence on the
goodwill and friendly cooperation between the two countries, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
Both developing countries, China and Moldova are faced with the
task of revitalizing their countries, and therefore China has set
a foreign policy of peace and friendship as its basic state policy,
said Li.
</P>
<P>
The signing of a joint statement and a series of documents
between the two countries during this visit is evidence of the
friendly feelings between the two countries and their common
aspiration to enhance cooperation, he added.
</P>
<P>
When it comes to parliament-to-parliament ties, Li noted that
exchange and cooperation between both parliaments are an important
part of the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between both parliaments over the past eight
years has seen closer exchanges and expanding cooperation, which
in turn has given impetus to the overall development of state-to-
state relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li hoped that both parliaments will arrange for more exchanges
to increase mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
Lucinschi said that Moldova is satisfied with the status quo of
bilateral relations. As a small country, Moldova appreciates the
fact that China, an influential country in the world, has
consistently adhered to the policy of equality between countries
regardless of their sizes, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will grant its more
than 250, 000 civil servants and their dependants health insurance
scheduled to start next month, local newspapers reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the New National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), a
senior official in the Ministry of Health was quoted by the
newspapers as saying that the scheme has been in the pipeline for
the last ten years and was now ready for practice.
</P>
<P>
Prof. F. L. Msambichaka, Chairman of the NHIS Board of
Directors which was inaugurated by the Minister for Health Dr
Aaron Chiduo on Wednesday, said that final preparations were well
underway.
</P>
<P>
"Major issues to be discussed in the meeting over the last two
days include determining the number of health centers and
hospitals to be commissioned to offer the out-patient and
in-patient services nationwide," he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, every civil servant, who needs to contribute
three percent of his monthly salaries, and his four dependants

<HEADLINE> South Africa Wishes Morocco to Withdraw World Cup Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The possibility of Morocco
withdrawing from the 2006 World Cup bid race will be discussed
when South Africa's Sports Minister Ngconde Balfour met Moroccan
World Cup bid officials in Rabat on Sunday, officials said on
Thursday
</P>
<P>
South Africa World Cup 2006 Bid Committee officials said
Balfour had been invited by the Moroccans, but there was no word
for the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Balfour was believed to seek to get Morocco to withdraw from
the race, leaving South Africa as the only African representative
in the bid to host the 2006 World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
It is not the first time South African officials have attempted
to persuade Morocco to withdraw. South Africa has long believed
the Moroccan bid has diluted their chances against the three other
candidates -- Brazil, England and Germany.
</P>
<P>
In case of a breakthrough the bid committee will also fly to
Morocco for further discussions, said chief executive officer
Danny Jordaan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a meeting between South Africa and Brazil has been
set in Johannesburg next week.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's football confederation president Ricardo Teixeira and
bid committee president Zico will meet South African officials to
discuss a possible deal in which Brazil would ensure South America
backed South Africa for the 2006 race. In return, Africa would
back a South American candidate for the 2010 World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Such a deal would mean Brazil withdrawing its bid to host the
2006 World Cup.

<HEADLINE> China to Accelerate Opening Up of Its West Regions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- China will accelerate opening up
of its west regions to meet the new challenge from economic
globalization and China's entry into the World Trade Organization
(WTO).
</P>
<P>
At an international symposium on development of western part of
China opened here today, Wei Jianguo, assistant minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, said that China's opening
up will enter a new stage with China's impending access to WTO and
the condition for accelerating the opening up of west China
regions is mature.
</P>
<P>
Wei said that promoting foreign trade and economic cooperation
in west China constituted a strategic part of China's goal to
become a strong external trade nation in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
He said that China will adopt more flexible policies to absorb
foreign funds. China sets great store by international
organizations' role in the development of its west and it is
determined to encourage international aid to go to the west.
</P>
<P>
The west China regions are advantageous in opening up, for
there are rich natural resources such as energy, mineral resources,
tourism and land resources there, Wei said, adding that with sound
development, China's west can become a large market with great
demands.
</P>
<P>
Based on the experiences of the development of China's eastern
coastal areas and with the support of the central government and
the people all over the country, the opening up of China's west
will make remarkable progress.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation has organized several investigation groups to go to
the provinces and autonomous regions in the west so that the
ministry will formulate specific policies to promote the opening
up of the west.

<HEADLINE> Typographic Printing Originates in China: Scholars (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Two Chinese linguists have recently
found new evidence to ascertain that the typographic printing
technique was originated exactly from China.
</P>
<P>
Shi Jinbo, Chief of the Western Xia Culture Research Center
under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), recently
found a block-printing edition of Buddhist Script in Western Xia
language of the middle age of the 12th century, which is believed
the oldest book of typographic printing.
</P>
<P>
The ancient Western Xia Regime (1038-1227) was located in
western China.
</P>
<P>
The script, now preserved in Russia, "is the earliest existing
copy of the hard-clay type printing which was 300 years older than
the earliest copy of its kind in Western countries," Shi said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another CASS research fellower Yasin Ashuri found
960 wooden types of ancient Huihe characters which were dated back
to 800 years ago at the Asian Arts Museum of Guimet in Paris.
</P>
<P>
In 744, an ancient Chinese nationality, the Huihe, established
the Huihe Regime in northern and western China.
</P>
<P>
The treasured types were transported in 1908 by a French Paul
Pelliot from the Cave Library of the Mogao Grottos in Dunhuang,
northwest Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
The Huihe types could be divided into alphabets, words, verb
stems, affixes, phonetic clusters, marginal lines and punctuations,
said Yasin, a language expert from the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
As one of the four great inventions made by ancient Chinese
people, the printing technique with movable types has been
regarded as an extremely important advancement in the world
history.

<HEADLINE> Typographic Printing Originates in China: Scholars (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his well-known book of Mengxi Bitan, the Notes in Dream Pool
Garden, Shen Kuo, a scientist in the Song Dynasty (960-1279),
described the movable-type printing technique and its inventor Bi
Sheng of the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127).
</P>
<P>
However, without early material evidence for the great
invention, some scholars in the world challenged the theory of
China's origination of the technique.
</P>
<P>
The latest find of movable types in the Western Xia language in
the similar age of the Song, provides solid proof for early
development and spread of the technique in China.
</P>
<P>
Located on the route of the Silk Road, the Huihe Regime
witnessed economic and cultural exchanges between China and
Western countries.
</P>
<P>
Different from the types invented by Bi Sheng on the basis of
words, the ancient Huihe people learned to use types on the basis
of alphabets and others, Yasin said.
</P>
<P>
Johann Gutenberg, a German printer who was reputed as the first
European to print with movable type, produced the first book, the
Bible, printed from movable type in 1456 at Mainz in Germany.
</P>
<P>
The China Social Sciences Documentation Publishing House has
published The Invention and Early Dissemination of China's Type
Printing, containing all the latest achievements made by Shi and
Yasin.
</P>
<P>
Shi Shuqing, Vice-Chairman of the National Committee for
Cultural Relics Authentication and Preservation, regards the
academic book as a new milestone in the research of its kind.

<HEADLINE> Clashes Continue in Indonesia's Aceh Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Clashes in Indonesia's
predominantly Muslim province of Aceh are continuing despite the
signing of a cease-fire agreement between the central government
and the Free Aceh Movement (GAM), reports reaching here said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Unrest and armed contacts continue to occur. The incidents
show how bad the security condition here is. The agreement seems
unable to restore security (in the province)," Antara news agency
quoted coordinator of a local legal aid foundation, Rufriadi, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that at least 31 people had died within 20 days
after the agreement was signed on May 12. And tens of others had
been injured in armed clashes and kidnappings that occurred in the
province in the same period.
</P>
<P>
"Some 13 civilians and a military man also went missing after
apparently being kidnapped by unidentified people," the reports
quoted a spokesman of the Human Rights Awareness Forum, Yarmen, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Some people have remained missing and no one seems to give this
any attention, Rufriadi noted.
</P>
<P>
He called on the military and the GAM to stop what he described
as cruel actions and sweeping operations as these do not make
people feel secure.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Indonesian government and the GAM on May
12 signed what they called a Humanitarian Pause Agreement in
Geneva,under which both sides agreed to reduce tension and
violence in the province.
</P>
<P>
The agreement took effect on June 2.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Asks ILO to Resume Assistance Programs for ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has urged the
International Labor Organization (ILO) to resume its technical
assistance programs for ASEAN countries, which were canceled or
postponed earlier due to various reasons.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Malaysian Deputy Human Resources Minister
Abdul Latiff Ahmad at the 88th session of the International Labor
Conference in Geneva Wednesday, whose speech was released here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The programs are important for enhancing human resources
development in the region of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) and they would directly benefit millions of
workers,Abdul Latiff said while making the call.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia hopes any new instruments proposed by the ILO should
be pragmatic, practicable and flexible and should be ratifiable
and duly complied, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added, "ILO should guard itself against recurrence of a
situation where instruments are withdrawn due to non-ratification
by member states."
</P>
<P>
Malaysia welcomes the withdrawal of outdated conventions which
is certainly a move in the right direction in addressing the ever-
changing work environment, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Efforts by developed countries to link labor standards and
international trade were rejected strongly by developing countries
as these moves are inimical to the interest and welfare of workers
and nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said developing countries must be equipped and have the
capacity and means to reap opportunities offered.
</P>
<P>
The developed countries at the same time must also play their
role in assisting developing countries to attain higher economic
growth and sustain their development, he added.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia accepts the challenges in labor-related issues and has
taken steps within its means and capability to deal with these new
challenges, he said, adding that measures are being taken to
uplift the country's competency levels.

Ordinary citizens are also painting and redecorating their
houses in an anticipation for the forthcoming government for

There are also some other Italian food factory recently came

As the small industries and businesses prosper in Mogadishu,
hundreds of people have also started refurbishing their houses and
painting them. Owing to the envisaged peace, many of the public
transport buses earlier made blackened metallic shells on wheels
for looting proof are now being reincarnated with new spare parts
such as windshields, new tires etc.

Many of those buses have also been serviced in an effort of

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs from
Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The Israelis' average monthly salary rose by 6.5
percent in the first quarter of 2000 to 6,665 shekels (about 1,666
U.S. dollars), according to statistics released by the Central
Bureau of Statistics (CBS).
</P>
<P>
Officials viewed the rise in various economic sectors as a
factor in the overall hike in wages.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's Lipman Electronic Engineering has signed a
four-year 20-million-dollars agreement to develop and supply credit
terminals with ERN, a U.S.-based electronic credit card processing
company.
</P>
<P>
The company's all-in-one terminals will be able to process
credit cards, checks, and debit cards. ERN will provide the check
processing and verification system. The terminals are aimed at the
U.S. market, which currently accounts for 60 percent of sales for
Lipman.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israeli Labor and Social Affairs Minister Eli
Yishai Wednesday signed an order shortening the work week to 43
hours as of July 1.
</P>
<P>
Factory workers have already been enjoying a 43-hour work week
since 1995, when the Histadrut labor federation signed an agreement
with the Coordinating Bureau of Economic Organization (an umbrella
organization for various groups of employers).
</P>
<P>
With the new order, employees who are not organized in labor
unions, mainly employees with free professions, will now enjoy a
43-hour week as well.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- Beogradska Banka, the biggest Yugoslav offshore
banking unit in Cyprus, is to suspend its operations on the island.
</P>
<P>
The staff at Beogradska Banka, which started operations in
Cyprus in the late 1980s, have already received letters saying the
bank was suspending operations.
</P>
<P>
The bank has been accused of maintaining close links with the
government of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, whom the
Western powers suspect of laundering money through Serbian business
interests in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkish Foreign Trade Undersecretary Kursad Tuzmen set
the government's 2000-2001 export target at 30 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Turzmen's remarks came during a speech Wednesday at a symposium
on the role of the Turkish textile and ready-to-wear sectors in the
accession process to the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Tuzmen said the Foreign Trade Undersecretariat has earmarked 40
million dollars for fashion incentives to boost exports of Turkey-
made textile and ready-to-wear goods.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkish Contractors' Association (TMB) Chairman Kadir
Sever said Turkey is expected to gain a larger share in the
Southeast European market through its membership of the European
Construction Industry Federation (FIEC).
</P>
<P>
Under the Balkan Stability Pact, construction works amounting to
12 billion dollars will be accomplished in the coming six years, he
said. "Work is going on to tender up to 1.5-2 billion dollar-worth
of construction projects by the end of 2000."
</P>
<P>
The FIEC has 31 members from 24 European countries. TMB was
named a member of FIEC in Luxembourg on May 25.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- A bill calling for the dissolution of Israel's 15th Knesset
(parliament) was passed Wednesday in the preliminary reading with
61 votes in favor and 48 against.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said ministers from three of
his coalition partners, Shas, National Religious Party and Yisrael
Ba'aliya, who voted for the bill, have thereby essentially resigned
their posts in the government on the basis of the "transition law"
governing periods of government restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Barak said during televised interviews Wednesday night that
there will be no election. He is expected to call a cabinet meeting
early next week and announce his decision to fire the rebel
ministers. He is then thought to be planning to open an intense
series of coalition negotiations in an effort to rebuild his
government.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States was mute Wednesday on Israel's Knesset
preliminary vote for early election, a move that could weaken
Barak's peacemaking hand and stymie U.S. efforts to help broker a
deal between Israel and the Palestinians by September.
</P>
<P>
"Israel is a thriving democracy, and I don't want to comment on
domestic political developments in that country. The Israeli
government and the Israeli people are committed to achieving a
comprehensive, lasting peace with their neighbors," a State
Department spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Six Knesset members accompanied by about a dozen young men
visited the site of a planned Jewish neighborhood on the edge of
Abu Dis late Wednesday afternoon, while some of the young people
planned to remain at the site indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
On a hilltop behind the construction site of what is rumored to
be going to the Palestinian parliament building, the legislators
from several right-wing parities and the young activists erected
the foundation of a fence delineating the area of Jewish-owned land
where the new neighborhood is slated to build.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet and Knesset decided last month to hand over
Abu Dis and two other Arab villages on the outskirts of Jerusalem
to the Palestinians, but the transfer was delayed because of the
clashes between Israeli soldiers and policemen and Palestinian
demonstrators, who asked Israel to release Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The Nautilus, a jointly developed U.S.-Israeli laser weapon,
has successfully shot down a rocket for the first time, project
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The test was carried out at the White Sands Missile Range in the
New Mexican desert on Tuesday. According to a Defense Ministry
statement, the Nautilus, known in the U.S. as the Tactical High
Energy Laser (THEL), "tracked and destroyed" a live Katyusha
rocket.
</P>
<P>
It was the first of series of shootdown tests the THEL must
undergo before it is handed over to Israel.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Holds Industry Trade Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's largest industrial
machinery showcases, the Industry Tradefair Malaysia 2000 (ITM
2000) and Machine Tool Malaysia 2000 (IMX 2000), opened here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The four-day event, the 14th in its series, sees 457 companies
from 27 countries displaying equipment.
</P>
<P>
The event, organized by Malaysian Exhibition Services (MES) Sdn
Bhd, features four national pavilions from China, Germany, South
Korea and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
A special feature of this year's show is the three dedicated "
focus villages" that enable businessmen to acquire an in-depth
knowledge of automation technology, printing and packaging, and
materials handling.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian manufacturing sector would receive a further
boost from ITM 2000, one organizer said, confident that ITM 2000
will lead to increased exports of Malaysia's industrial machinery
as the showcase promotes its latest machinery and equipment,
automation and production processes and engineering expertise.
</P>
<P>
ITM 2000 and IMX 2000 would encourage foreign entrepreneurs and
companies to forge joint ventures and smart partnerships and seek
financial assistance and business innovations.
</P>
<P>
Opening the event, Malaysia's Deputy International Trade and
Industry Minister Kerk Choo Ting said the manufacturing sector
provides the major impetus for economic recovery with a 13.5-
percent growth recorded in 1999 and a 30.1-percent share of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's manufactured goods exports accounted for 84.6
percent of total exports in 1999 and for the first quarter of 2000,
the sector registered a growth of 27.3 percent, reflecting the
continued strong expansion of manufacturing output and exports.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's manufacturing sector continued to attract
substantial investments, he said, adding that for the period
between 1999 and April 2000, 911 projects were approved with
investments totaling 19.4 billion ringgit (5.105 billion U.S.
dollars), of which local investments accounted for 29.4 percent
and foreign investments 70.6 percent.

dollars Thursday against Wednesday's 1.3 billion shares worth some
20 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said trading volume remained light because foreign
investors were still apprehensive about aggressively positioning
themselves in the market.

<HEADLINE> Afghanistan to Form Human Rights Commission: Taliban Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban's Foreign
Minister Wakil Ahmad Mutawakkil said Thursday that the militia
plans to set up a commission which would respond to international
criticism of human rights violations in the country.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with BBC, the minister said the first thing is
that there was no such commission in Afghanistan. Then, there was
unfounded criticism of the Taliban which control most of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Therefore the commission would serve as a source of information
about human rights in Afghanistan, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Mutawakkil, most of human rights violations
reports on Afghanistan are based on the information provided by
the opponents of the Taliban regime.
</P>
<P>
The commission would not only offer convincing response to some
opposition leaders but would also remain in contact with various
organizations and share information with international mass media
about human rights, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mutawakkil said there are some un-Islamic things which are
called human rights by some people and the commission would
highlight such rights in the light of Islamic and Afghan values.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia
have agreed to cooperate in rubber trade, which will cover
exchanges of technical information and price support, the Thai

trade, as well as in setting up joint ventures to purchase natural
rubber from the buffer stock of the International Rubber
Organization, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The planned joint ventures would be managed and operated by
Indonesian private firms, he said.

<HEADLINE> Policy Not to Change Despite Government Changes: Polish PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Poland will adhere to its previous
political policies no matter what happens to the government, said
Polish Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
"Stability and continuity are of much significance in politics,
" he said when delivering a speech on TV, noting that the June 6
collapse of the center-right coalition will not affect his
leadership in the government.
</P>
<P>
The Freedom Union (UW), Poland's second largest party, broke up
from the ruling coalition led by Buzek's Solidarity Election
Action (AWS), after rows of economic reforms, leaving the
government a minority one.
</P>
<P>
Buzek, still the leader of the government according to the
constitution, appealed in his speech for an all-party cooperation
of every political power.
</P>
<P>
He also said that to solidify the country's image of political
and economic stability is a priority among four major tasks facing
his government.
</P>
<P>
The other three are to prepare crucial negotiations with
European Union members of its entry into the bloc, to discover and
rectify any shortcomings and mistakes of the undergoing reform and
to work out a draft budget propitious to the whole development.

<HEADLINE> France Asks ECB Not to Raise Interest Rates Too High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- French Minister of Economy, Finance
and Industry Laurent Fabius Thursday called on the European
Central Bank (ECB) not to raise its interest rates too high.
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve economic growth and rising employment level,
the number one objective should be to have a strong and stable
euro, said Fabius in an interview with Radio-Television Luxembourg.
In the meantime, he also stressed that the euro zone countries
demand accommodating interests which won't hinder the economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Fabius made the remarks a few hours before the governing
council of the European bank was due to announce its decision on
principle interest rates, which were expected to be raised by it
in order to fend off the risk of inflation in the euro zone
countries.
</P>
<P>
Raising interest rates will also help consolidate the single
currency whose value has been rising against the U.S. dollar over
the past two weeks, following a fall by nearly 20 percent in the
past several months against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Economic forecasts said that the 11 euro zone countries are
expected to have an average 3.5 percent growth of gross domestic
product this year and 3.3 percent next year.

<P>
GENEVA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss Federal Railways has
signed a deal with their German and Austrian counterparts to
improve cross-border passenger traffic, according to a Swiss Radio
International report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The deal, signed in the German city of Munich, foresees a
unified system for passengers and involves investment of 2.5
billion Swiss francs (about 1.54 billion U.S. dollars) for about
130 new tilting trains.
</P>
<P>
"We want to create the best price/quality ratio on the European
transport market," said Benedikt Weibel, chief executive of the
Swiss Federal Railways. "The offer will include attractive
products, attractive prices and a unified concept."
</P>
<P>
It is foreseen that the new rolling stock will increase
productivity of the three railways by five percent per year.
</P>
<P>
The trains, probably of similar design to the Swiss Federal
Railways' recently-launched ICN tilting trains, will come into
service from 2005. Tenders to produce them will be invited at the
end of summer.
</P>
<P>
The rail alliance will remain open to other partners, with a
particular eye on welcoming Italy.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Defector Is MKO Member, Iran Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Iran has claimed the reported
defector Ahmad Behbahani who accused Tehran of masterminding the
1988 Lockerbie bombing was a member of the outlawed Mujaheddin
Khalq Organization (MKO).
</P>
<P>
In a statement released on Wednesday night, the Intelligence
Ministry said Behbahani, whose real name is Shahram Beladi
Behbahani and was born in 1968, was sentenced to imprisonment in
late 1990 for being involved in an armed robbery, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Behbahani illegally left Iran and sought for political asylum in
Iraq, the statement said, adding that during his stay in Iraq he
joined the MKO and received espionage training for seven years.
</P>
<P>
Under the supervision of the International Red Cross Committee,
the Iraqi government handed him over to Iran on March 31, 1998 and
he was sentenced to 10 years in prison after he confessed to
cooperation with the MKO, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The MKO, the main political and military opposition group based
in Iraq, has launched a series of attacks on Iranian interests
since it broke away with the Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
Behbahani escaped from Iran to Turkey on a temporary leave from
prison, the ministry added.
</P>
<P>
The American CBS television broadcast on Sunday that Behbahani,
who claimed to have been former head of Iran's foreign terrorism
activities, said Iran planned and carried out the 1988 bombing of
the Pan-American airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in which 270
people died.
</P>
<P>
Behbahani, living in a foreign asylum seekers camp in Turkey,
said that he had been responsible for all "terrorist" operations
carried out by the Iranian government beyond its borders until he
had crossed the border to Turkey four months ago following a rift
with his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
He said a group of Libyans received 90 days of training in Iran
to carry out the bombing after he persuaded to Ahmad Jibril, who
heads a Syrian-backed armed group, the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command, into accepting the plan.
</P>
<P>
However, Iranian Intelligence Minister Ali Yunesi soon denied
any link between his ministry and Behbahani and said that since the
establishment of the Iranian Intelligence Ministry, no person named
Ahmad Behbahani has been working with the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Following the CBS report, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency
(the CIA) had been interviewing Behbahani for the past several
days. Some U.S. intelligence agents have expressed skepticism over
his claims.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Speed Up Rural Communications Infrastructure Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Energy,
Communications and Multimedia Minister Leo Moggie said Thursday
that his government will speed up the development of
communications infrastructure in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
This is to enable people in these areas to use information
communication technology (ICT) and have access to the Internet in
line with the government's efforts to give every citizen equitable
access to information, he said in Kuching, Sarawak, East Malaysia,
according to Bernama news agency.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, the government will provide funding to the
Universal Service Provision (USP) fund which will be mainly used
for installing telephone lines in the rural areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said all licensed telephone operators in the
country have been asked to contribute their respective portions to
the USP fund.
</P>
<P>
Telekom Malaysia, the largest telecommunication company in the
country, has been entrusted with the construction of the lines
until the end of this year, Leo said, adding, "Next year we may
allow other operators to provide the lines with expenditure coming
from the fund."
</P>
<P>
The government in collaboration with the private sector will
carry out a study on how the ICT could improve the socioeconomic
lives of rural communities, he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's goals in the next five years are to provide 500
fixed lines and 250 Internet lines for every 1,000 people.
Malaysia has a population of some 22 million.
</P>
<P>
The number of Internet subscribers in Malaysia is expected to
reach 1.4 million by the year 2002, which would translate into 4.2
million users.
</P>
<P>
"Our young population, high literacy rate and improving
affordability of personal computers will further spur Internet
usage in the country," the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Advises Youth for HIV/AIDS Test before Marriage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa has appealed to parents to advise their children to
undertake HIV/AIDS test prior to marriage, local newspapers
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa told a special meeting of the Tanzania Parents'
Association here Wednesday that it is high time parents openly
discuss the subject with their children as it is the only way of
reducing the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The president disclosed that among every 100 Tanzanians, 10 are
HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
"You should tell your children that HIV/AIDS scourge is
claiming lives of many people and they should, therefore, stick to
one partner before and after marriage," he said, urging total
openness in the struggle against the pandemic to forestall an
imminent catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the pandemic has robbed the nation of its
potential manpower and its costs to the government, society and
national development are enormous.
</P>

The first three AIDS cases in Tanzania were reported in
northwestern Kagera Region in 1983.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Seeks Funds to Help Pastoralists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is seeking
10.57 million U.S. dollars to support pastoralists living in
northern and eastern Kenya who are affected by the prolonged
drought in most parts of the country, the East African Standard
newspaper said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The government said Wednesday that it intended to establish
some 50 emergency slaughtering slabs with basic facilities and
hygienic conditions in 10 drought-stricken districts.
</P>
<P>
According to the program, the slaughter slabs will accommodate
75,000 cattles and prepare dry meat which will be distributed as
food aid to the needy population.
</P>
<P>
The move will also salvage the value of animals in meat and
hide, ease the pressure on the limited pasture and water, and help
the livestock owners to generate some income.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that if the dry weather spell continues up to
August, the current livestock population in Isiolo, Marsabit and
Moyale districts in Eastern Province will be reduced by half.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi Wednesday appealed to the
local and international community for 11.5 billion shillings (150
million dollars) in emergency food aid to combat drought and
famine.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Holds Talks With South Korean, U.S. Presidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori
Thursday held talks with visiting South Korean President Kim Dae
Jung and U.S. President Bill Clinton separately on bilateral ties
and regional issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
One of the major topic of the talks was the upcoming first-ever
summit between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Kim told Mori that he will urge the DPRK to improve ties with
Japan and the United States at the inter-Korea summit in Pyongyang
next week, Japanese officials said.
</P>
<P>
The officials said Kim and Mori also confirmed the importance
of cooperation among Japan, South Korea and the United States in
dealing with the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
The inter-Korea summit was also a topic in Mori's talks with
Clinton, held shortly after the Mori-Kim meeting.
</P>
<P>
Both Kim and Clinton were in Tokyo to attend the official
funeral of the late Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, who died
last month after suffering a stroke.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with Mori, Kim said he will tell DPRK leader Kim
Jong Il that maintaining good relations with Japan, South Korea
and the United States would benefit Pyongyang's goals of seeking
security and revitalizing its economy, an official said.
</P>
<P>
Kim and Mori shared the hope that the historic unofficial visit
to Beijing last week by the DPRK leader will give a positive
impetus to the three-day summit starting next Monday, said the
official.
</P>
<P>
On Japan's relations with the DPRK, Mori reiterated Tokyo's
willingness to make progress in talks between Japan and the DPRK
on normalizing diplomatic ties, and asked Kim to convey the
message to the DPRK leader, the official said, adding that Kim had
agreed to pass on the request.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral ties, Mori welcomed the recent progress in
cultural exchanges, including cooperation between Japanese and
South Korean universities, calling it the fruit of Kim's decision
in 1998 to open South Korea's doors to Japanese popular culture.
</P>
<P>
Mori and Clinton, during their meeting, agreed to continue
close consultations and policy coordination among Japan, South
Korea and the United States toward the success of the inter-Korea
summit.
</P>
<P>
Clinton called the inter-Korea talks extremely important,
adding that it was important for the DPRK to normalize diplomatic
relations with other countries, including South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Mori gave high credit to Clinton for working to grant China
permanent normal-trade-relations (PNTR) status and for boosting
the momentum for China's accession to the World Trade Organization
(WTO), according to Japanese officials.
</P>
<P>
Clinton called it an "economic and strategic" move, and
stressed that it is important for China to become a constructive
partner in the world community, they said.
</P>
<P>
Mori and Clinton also agreed to continue to work toward
resolving pending bilateral issues, specifically the dispute over
interconnection fees charged by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
Corp. (NTT), and ongoing negotiations toward renewing a treaty on
Japan's host-nation financial support for U.S. military bases, the
officials said.

<P>
TOKYO, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices fell for the third
consecutive day in Tokyo Thursday, with investors cautious ahead
of Friday's release of Japanese gross domestic product (GDP) data.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 140.62 points, or 0.82
percent, from Wednesday's close to end at 17,004.34.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, dropped 2.32 points or 0.15 percent to 1,586.
17.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section decreased to 712.85 million
shares from Wednesday's 813.54 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Denki Kagaku Kogyo, a general chemical maker, was the day's
volume leader.
</P>
<P>
While the GDP data for the January-March quarter are expected
to show an improvement, fears are growing that the expansion may
boost the yen against the U.S. dollar and thus push down export-
oriented stocks, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Information and technology issues faced selling following their
recent gains.
</P>
<P>
Losers included oil distributors, retailers and food makers,
while in contrast, the rubber, mining and brokerage sectors were

Of the issues listed on the First Section, gainers surpassed
losers 715 to 507 despite the falls in the Nikkei and TOPIX, with

TAIYUAN, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The tallest ancient wooden pagoda
in the world, some 944 years old in Yingxian County in central
China's Shanxi Province, was lately measured at 65.86 meters in
height.

"The new height was obtained using the latest gauging
technology, and the error is so little it could be measured in
millimeters," said Cai Zejun, a prominent expert on ancient
architecture who also runs a renovation project to protect the
wooden pagoda.
</P>
<P>
Before the new figure was released, people tend to believe that
the pagoda stands 67.31 meters high, which was measured in the
1930s by the well-known architect Liang Sicheng.
</P>
<P>
The pagoda is in serious need of repair, mainly due damage
caused by numerous strong earthquakes and artillery attacks. The
first two storeys of the pagoda are leaning northeastward, and
some of its wooden columns are broken or split.
</P>
<P>
The increasing occurrence of earthquakes in the area makes it
even more urgent to realign and restore the pagoda, said Cai Zejun.
As a result, the Chinese government plans to start a massive
restoration project to save the pagoda at all cost.

<HEADLINE> Manila Aims to Achieve 3 Goals in Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Thursday that members of the cabinet aim to achieve three goals
during a mercy mission President Joseph Estrada has ordered them
to undertake in two conflict-hit areas in southern Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Benjamin Diokno of the Department of Budget and
Management said the cabinet mission will show that military action
is not the government's main solution to the strife.
</P>
<P>
"We need to develop Mindanao. Development is the key to lasting
peace there," Diokno said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Japan Tuesday, President Estrada dispatched
members of his cabinet to visit Cotabato and General Santos cities
in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
He instructed them to attend to the needs of evacuees there and
provide them with health, education and other basic services.
</P>
<P>
Diokno said the second goal is to hasten the implementation of
the ongoing development projects in the areas that have been
affected by the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The third goal, he said, is to design a medium-term plan for
Mindanao's development. He said this should dispel speculations
that the government is "militarizing" the south.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the mission is the first of what could be a
series of visits to conflict-hit areas in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"The president ordered us to make a report. Perhaps we'll go
there in a big way in the next few days," he said.
</P>
<P>
Government troops and Moro Islamic Liberation Front rebels have
been locked in fierce battles in Mindanao since April, resulting
in heavy losses on both sides.

They were in addition to 200 people who escaped through a fence
around midnight Wednesday and 70 others who fled an hour later.
</P>
<P>
Of the group of 70, about 50 had been recaptured and were being

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Refuses to Accept British Observers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe refused to accept British
monitors in the June 24-25 parliamentary elections, Minister of
Information, Posts and Telecommunications Chen Chimutengwende said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The minister was reacting to a statement by British Foreign
Minister of State for African affairs Peter Hain on Tuesday that
the Zimbabwean government did not want free and fair parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate that the British Junior Foreign Office
Minister Peter Hain continued to display his rabid hatred for
Zimbabwe by concluding that the forthcoming parliamentary
elections will not be free and fair before they have been held,"
the Zimbabwean minister said.
</P>
<P>
"It is the British who are unfair and not us. We will never
accept to be a neo-colony of Britain," the minister said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
International observers, including the Commonwealth, the
Organization of African Unity, the Southern African Development
Community, the European Union and countries like Botswana, South
Africa and the United States had been invited to monitor the
elections.
</P>
<P>
He said the British had been meddling in Zimbabwe's affairs
during the run-up to the elections.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of protestations to the contrary, the UK Labour
government seems inveterately committed, not just to influence
events in this country, but to determine Zimbabwe's political and
economic course," he said.
</P>
<P>
British companies in Zimbabwe had been persuaded to close shops
in order to create shortages, while workers had been forced to go
on leave and threatened with dismissal if they voted the ruling
Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-pf) led by
President Robert Mugabe to back into power, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are very much aware of the evil machinations of the
British. Our people are heroic people. We have suffered before at
the hands of British colonialists and minority racist regimes," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Peter Hain has also suggested that the British government
should appeal to the U.N. to send troops to Zimbabwe if the
elections are not free and fair.
</P>
<P>
"I can assure him that we will never accept that. We will shoot
them if they come to Zimbabwe. They should go to DRC (the
Democratic Republic of the Congo) or Somalia. Just because three
whites were killed, so the British want the U.N. to send troops.
That is out-right racism on the part of the British," he said.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Accuses Rwanda of Breaking Cease-Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan army has accused Rwandan
troops of not respecting the newly-reached cease-fire and
occupying the Bangoka Airport in violation of the agreement on
demilitarization of Kisangani, a northeastern city of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
"The Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) did not respect the
cease-fire which had been agreed on to leave a buffer zone of 700
meters on either side of Tchopo bridge," Ugandan Army Spokesman
Phinehas Katirima told Xinhua Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"They pounded the positions of the Uganda People's Defence
Forces (UPDF) three times last night," Katirima said.
</P>
<P>
The RPA has occupied the Bangoka Airport after the UPDF had
pulled out of it in the first phase of the withdrawal, said
Katirima, adding that " since they have occupied it in violation
of the demilitarization accord, we will ensure that they do not
use it."
</P>
<P>
The latest round of fighting between Uganda and Rwanda broke
out on Monday after they began to withdraw from Kisangani later
last month as part of the demilitarization agreement following the
clashes between the two armies in early May.
</P>
<P>
The two former allies have their troops stationed in Kisangani
where they have backed rival rebel factions fighting against the
DRC President Laurent Kabila.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Telecom Company Registered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A regional telecommunications
company comprised of 10 member states of the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) has finally been registered,
Zambian newspaper The Post reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to COMESA public relations manager Mweuse Karake, the
COMESA Telecommunications Company (COMTEL) will now operate as an
off-shore company to be based in the Mauritian capital Port Louis,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Karake as saying here on Wednesday the company was
fully registered on May 26, 2000.
</P>
<P>
"This means that the company can now form a board of directors
and can go in any agreements with banks. Ten national
telecommunications companies signed the COMTEL agreement which is
above the minimum requirement to facilitate for registration," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also said COMESA had received applications from different
qualified and experienced companies in the area of
telecommunication, applying to be single equity partners in
COMTEL.
</P>
<P>
Karake said five companies have been short listed from where a
qualifying company will be selected in two months' time.
</P>
<P>
Karake said the individual national telecommunications
companies and the strategic share-holding partner will be
represented in appointing the board of directors for COMTEL.
</P>
<P>
He said the strategic equity partner will have 35 percent and
COMTEL will have 25 percent while the private sector will have 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
And COMESA acting secretary general Ngwenya said COMTEL was an
important instrument for trade and social network when the first
five countries signed the COMTEL agreement that resulted in the
setting up of the offshore company.
</P>
<P>
He added African countries were losing over 100 million U.S.
dollars annually in telecommunications transiting through
international carriers.

<HEADLINE> Survey: U.S. Kids Flood Onto Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. children are fueling the
Internet explosion, with the number of 2 to 17-year-olds logging
into cyberspace tripling since 1997, according to a national
survey released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the San Mateo, California-based
Grunwald associates, found that more than 25 million children in
the United States are on the Internet, up from 8 million in 1997.
And by the year 2005, the number of children online is expected to
increase by another 70 percent, the survey predicted.
</P>
<P>
"The notion that children are an emerging market is no longer
true. They have emerged," said Peter Grunwald, president of the
Grunwald Associates.
</P>
<P>
Grunwald attributed the growth of kids on the Internet partly
to the skyrocketing number of mothers online. The survey showed a
quadrupling of moms on the Internet, from 4.5 million in 1997 to
16.4 million by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Children were found to be a primary reason behind household
decisions to purchase a computer and gain Internet access,
Grunwald said. "Parents believe the Internet is an important tool
for their children's learning and development," he said.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that of all U.S. family households,
almost two-thirds have home computers, and 46 percent are hooked
to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
However, schools are predicted to likely surpass homes as the
primary gateway to the Internet for children by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Grunwald Associates, a market research and consulting firm,
completed the survey by reaching at random 1,735 U.S. households
that included computer users and nonusers.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing Improves Management of Resettlement Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing Municipal People's
Government reiterated today that it will strengthen the management
of funds allocated for the popular resettlement of the Three
Gorges Dam project and deal harshly with those who may be misusing
funds or taking bribes.

</P>
<P>
Seminar on Western China Development Held in Chongqing
</P>
<P>
An international seminar on the development of western China
opens today in Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
The three-day seminar has invited 100 celebrated experts,
scholars, and politicians from the United States, Britain, Russia,
Japan, France, Germany, Australia, and Canada including Lawrence
Klein, a Nobel laureate, Bob Hawke, former prime minister of
Australia, and K.Remchukov, vice chairman of the Committee of
Natural Resources of the State Duma of Russia. Also on hand will
be representatives of a dozen of the 500 top multinational
corporations and international organizations.
</P>
<P>
The seminar is jointly sponsored by the Chongqing Municipal
Government, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the

China to Tap Tourism Resources in Western Areas
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will allocate 800 million yuan for the
construction of infrastructure facilities in key scenic spots this
year, with 600 million yuan being designated for its western areas.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xiqin, deputy director of the State Tourism
Administration, said on Wednesday that the central government is
stipulating a series of preferential policies to stimulate the
development of tourism industry in western China.
</P>
<P>
The 10 provinces, autonomous regions and municipality in
western China have all made tourism a pillar industry, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
China to Develop More Ground Water Resources in Western areas
</P>
<P>
Chinese geologists will work to determine a group of
perspective water resource areas in western China, in an effort to
meet the needs of major construction projects and development of
urban areas there.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Land and Resources said his
ministry's water resource exploration will focus on ground water
resources in big cities, industrial and agricultural development
zones in western China.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan's Investment Fair Fruitful

<P>
China's Westward Focus to Challenge Surveying and Mapping
</P>
<P>
The central government's decision to develop western China has
created both opportunities and challenges for the country's
surveying and mapping departments, said the director of the State
Bureau of Surveying and Mapping.
</P>
<P>
Surveying and mapping work done to date for western China's
vast areas leaves much to be desired, SBSM Director Chen Bangzhu
said. Most maps of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region were made
in the 1960s and 1970s, when the area lagged far behind the rest
of the country in development.
</P>
<P>
The bureau will provide general surveying and mapping reference
data for the central government, including information on
infrastructure construction, environmental protection, and natural
resources.

<P>
WELLINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Foreign Minister
Phil Goff is pessimistic about the prospects of peace in the
Solomon Islands as violence escalates there.
</P>
<P>
Goff is due to fly to the Solomon Islands' capital Honiara
Friday as part of a Commonwealth mission, which will also visit
the Pacific's other trouble spot, Fiji.
</P>
<P>
The Evening Post Thursday quoted the foreign minister as saying
that an agreement signed Wednesday by the dissident Malaita Eagle
Force to have Solomons Prime Minister Bartholomew Ulufa'alu
released has not been honored, while violence is increasing there.
</P>
<P>
The minister is unsure whether the violence will develop into a
full-scale civil war, the Wellington-based newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
"I am rather more pessimistic about the prospects (for peace)
given the events of the last 12 or 15 hours," Goff said.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out any peacekeeping force going to the Solomons while
neither the Malaita Eagle Force nor the Isatabu Freedom Movement
showed any willingness to negotiate a peace.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment there isn't a peace to keep, but the (New
Zealand)Government will contemplate an invitation to send a
peacekeeping force if the parties are ready to come to the
negotiating table," he said.

<HEADLINE> Pollution Unabated in Kathmandu Valley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Air quality in the Kathmandu
valley has not improved much despite some pro-environment measures
taken by the government in the last year, according to a data
analysis issued here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The data analysis prepared by the Environment Assessment and
Material Testing Division (EAMTD) said the air quality in the
Kathmandu valley is more or less the same as a year ago.
</P>
<P>
EAMTD compared this year's levels of total suspended
particulate matters (TSP) in various thoroughfares of the valley
with those of last year.
</P>
<P>
"At one point, TSP levels were recorded at 235.8, compared to
237.15 at the same time last year," said the analysis report.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government launched an anti-pollution drive in the
polluted valley last year and took a series of pro-environmental
decisions aimed at retaining the historic valley's natural charm.
</P>
<P>
These decisions included a ban on polluting three-wheelers and
a ban on the import of two-stroke motor bikes and vehicles that do
not meet Euro-I emission standard.
</P>
<P>
Besides blaming vehicular emission, EAMTD analysis pointed to
other factors like cement factories, brick kilns and dozens of
dyeing factories.
</P>
<P>
Badly maintained roads, two-stroke vehicles, improper emission
testing instruments and burning of plastics and rubber by city
dwellers are also attributed to the pollution, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report urged the government to take more stringent anti-
pollution measures.
</P>
<P>
Deteriorating air quality is detrimental to the centuries-old
historic monuments and temples in the valley that were listed as
cultural heritage by the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization, thus impairing the thriving tourism in the Himalayan
country.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Beat Pacers Easily In Game 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Shaquille O'Neal scored 43
points and grabbed 19 rebounds as Los Angeles Lakers kept a
comfortable lead most of the way and defeated the Indiana Pacers
104-87 in Game 1 of the NBA finals Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
As expected, O'Neal was an unstoppable force against an
opponent with few options for slowing him down. Whether they
single-teamed him or used double-coverage, nothing really worked
for the Pacers in trying to stop the Lakers' 7-foot-1 center.
</P>
<P>
It was O'Neal's highest-scoring game since getting 46 points in
Game 1 of the first round of playoffs against the Sacramento Kings.
</P>
<P>
Kobe Bryant added 14 points, Ron Harper 12 and Rick Fox 11 for
the Lakers, who didn't have the emotional letdown their coach Phil
Jackson feared after their stunning comeback in Game 7 of the
Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
Instead, it was Indiana's Reggie Miller who shrunk under the
pressure, shooting an abysmal 1-for-16 and scoring just seven
points.
</P>
<P>
Mark Jackson led Indiana with 18 points, while Austin Croshere
added 16 and Jalen Rose and Rik Smits had 12 apiece.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers outrebounded the Pacers 48-36 and controlled the
game in so many ways, giving credence to those who argued that
they present too many matchup problems for a Pacers team that
could be overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
It didn't take long for Shaquille O'Neal to show the Indiana
Pacers what was in store for them during the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers were regarded as the killer team of all the Eastern
teams during the regular season, when there seemed none of them
escaped from defeat. Jackson, the former head coach of the Chicago
Bulls, said at the end of regular season that there were three
reasons behind the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
"Firstly Shaquille is dominant at every game with the east
teams. Secondly some of the Eastern best players came to the
Western team, including Scottie Pippen to Trail Blazers, Ron
Harper to the Lakers. Thirdly, I, as head coach for the Bulls,
have been much familiar with the Eastern teams." Jackson explained.
</P>
<P>
Most experts believe the Lakers is more favorit to win this
year's NBA
finals than the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of media swarmed the court like insects to get quotes
and comments from Lakers and Pacers players and coaches. On the
first day of availability for the two teams, TV cameramen jostled
with beat writers for prime position as players looked on in
amazement. "More media. That's the biggest thing you've got to
deal with," said Lakers forward Robert Horry, who won NBA titles
with the Rockets in '94 and '95.
</P>
<P>
Around 20,000 Laker fans watched the game, with ticket price
tag of a courtside seat was as high as 1,150 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Game two is scheduled also in Los Angeles Friday night.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Evacuate 700 from Solomon Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Australia would evacuate 700
Australians trapped by the coup in the Solomon Islands, Defense
Minister John Moore said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Australia was to send the Navy heavy lift ship, the HMAS Tobruk,
which would arrive in Honiara, capital of the Solomon Islands, on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Moore told reporters the government had decided to undertake
the evacuation of Australians and other approved nationals from
Honiara.
</P>
<P>
"In the light of the further deterioration of the security
situation in and around Honiara, the Australian High Commissioner
Dr. Sharp has requested the evacuation of Australian citizens and
other nationals," Moore said.
</P>
<P>
"HMAS Tobruk will be tasked to carry out this evacuation, and
it will arrive in Honiara this afternoon," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government diverted Tobruk from transit from Bougainville
to Vanuatu two days ago to take up position off the Solomon
Islands for the evacuation should it be required, Moore said.
</P>
<P>
"The safety of Australians is the prime concern of the
Australian government," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai's
visit to Cambodia next week will strengthen ties and cooperation
between the two neighboring countries, the state-run Thailand News
Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chuan will pay an official visit to Cambodia from June 14 to 16,

cooperation for the return of stolen or embezzled vehicles and an
agreement on combating against illicit trafficking and cross
border smuggling of movable cultural property and restitution to
the country of origin.
</P>
<P>
The first agreement is believed to help prevent and crack down
on car thefts and smuggling from Thailand to Cambodia while the
second will help solve the problem of smuggling of ancient art
objects as well as to facilitate the return of confiscated
cultural property to the country of origin.
</P>
<P>
The Thai leader is paying a three-day visit to Japan to attend
the official memorial service of late Japanese prime minister

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Shuttlers Prioritize Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian shuttlers said they will
prioritize the Olympic Games in Sydney in September, not the 15th
National Games (PON) in Surabaya, capital of East Java, this month,
according to the Jakarta Post Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Veteran shuttler Rexy Mainaky said he would put aside his
desire to perform in the PON for the country's bigger priority to
retain the gold medal tradition in badminton at Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"I personally still want to compete in PON but the Badminton
Association of Indonesia (PBSI) has decided to ban Olympic
qualifiers from playing in the event. We must obey the decision,"
said the 1996 Olympics gold medalists with partner Ricky Subagja.
</P>
<P>
Tony Gunawan, the world number one pair with Chandra Wijaya,
said the Olympics remained the top priority in his program
although he personally wants to compete in PON from June 19 to 30.
</P>
<P>
While women's singles Ellen Angelina, representing Central Java,
said she opted to prioritize the Olympics above PON.
</P>
<P>
"It's OK for me to skip PON as I have more time to prepare
myself for the remaining Grand Prix series and the Olympics," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Women's doubles specialist Cynthia Tuwankotta, who represents
Jakarta, said: "Actually I want to play in PON. However, the ban
is for our benefit to enable us prepare better for the Olympics,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, chairman of the PBSI West Java chapter Lutfi Hamid
questioned the decision to ban the athletes from competing in PON.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that participation in PON would not disturb the
shuttlers preparation for the Olympics and PBSI officials must not
worry about the possibility shuttlers might get injured during the
quadrennial event.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Gems Sale Sets New Record in 1999-2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Myanma Gems Enterprise (MGE)
earned a total of 48.27 million U.S. dollars from its two gems
sales and other revenues in the fiscal year 1999-2000 which ended
in March, official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the new record of income to more sales of
gems and export by the country's national entrepreneurs and the
effectiveness in controlling the smuggling out of precious stones
from the country.
</P>
<P>
The MGE organizes two gems emporiums every year -- the annual
one in March and the mid-year one in October -- in its bid to
increase the earning and develop gems and jewelry market in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, a well-known producer of jade, ruby and sapphire in
the world, earned over 300 million dollars from its 37 annual and
eight mid-year gems emporiums, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The annual events started in 1964 and the mid-year ones added
since 1992, each time attracting hundreds of foreign gems
merchants from a dozen countries and regions especially from China
's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Thailand and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar enacted the New Gemstone Law in September
1995, allowing national entrepreneurs to mine, produce, transport
and sell finished gemstones and manufactured jewelry at home and
abroad.

<HEADLINE> Solar Storms to Hit Earth, Canadian Scientists Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A new round of solar storms could
blanket the Earth sometime Wednesday and last as long as eight
days, Canadian scientists warned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The eruption occurred Tuesday from a cluster of sunspots on the
upper left-hand corner of the sun, according to the scientists.
</P>
<P>
It is the beginning of the peak of the sun's 11-year cycle.
We're at the peak and it's hard to say if sun flares might get
worse or fizzle out, said Chris Hunt of the University of
Toronto's astronomy department.
</P>
<P>
However, Canadian experts say this time they have much less to
worry about. The upcoming solar storm blasted hundreds of millions
of tons of charged particles into space.
</P>
<P>
"Our satellites are designed to handle the solar cycle, and
have some margin built in to accommodate when storms occur," said
Len Stass, vice-president of space systems at Telesat, a satellite
uplink company in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, most cellphones and pagers in Canada are
land-based and don't rely on satellites, said Mark Choma of the
Canadian Wireless Telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
They believe what can occur are changes to the Earth's magnetic
field that could cause some very brief blackouts rather than
inherent damage.
</P>
<P>
The geomagnetic storm last hit Canada in 1989, when the Hydro-
Quebec power system collapsed, leaving 6 million people without
electricity for hours.

<P>
SHENYANG, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province, home to one-tenth of the country's large State-owned
enterprises (SOEs), vowed to establish a unified, standard and
improved social insurance network by legal means.
</P>
<P>
In a circular to local courts, the Liaoning Provincial Higher
People's Court urged them to improve the trials of social
insurance-related cases and strictly punish those law-breakers.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is working out an independent social
insurance system which is expected to cover medicare expenses,
pension, and housing of the employees of the State-owned
businesses, sources said.
</P>
<P>
A company of social insurance in Fushun City in the province
used social insurance fund as a gurantee fund for its bank loans.
The Provincial Higher People's Court ruled that this was illegal
and declared the contract of gurantee invalid, and the bank was
not allowed to transfer social insurance fund to pay back the
company's due loans.
</P>
<P>
This was only the third case of its kind and much remains to
be done in this regard, court sources said.

<HEADLINE> Global Chip Sales Grow Stronger Than Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide chip market is
expected to grow at an annual rate of 20 percent through 2003, the
Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The industry has not seen such growth since the 1993-1995
period," said the U.S. trade group. Semiconductor market growth is
being driven largely by the increasing pervasiveness of the
Internet and wireless communication products, expanding such
semiconductor product segments as digital signal processors (DSP),
flash memory, analog and optoelectronics, SIA said.
</P>
<P>
In releasing its mid-year forecast, SIA also expects worldwide
semiconductor sales to rise by 31 percent in 2000 over last year.
Chip sales will continue its strong growth in 2001, jumping 25
percent to 244 billion U.S. dollars, followed by an increase of 14
percent to 279 billion dollars in 2002, and a 12 percent hike to
312 billion dollars in 2003.
</P>
<P>
The Internet, communications and wireless consumer products,
the new growth drivers for the semiconductor industry, demonstrate
the shift from personal computers -- which still remain the
largest single market for chips -- to a more balanced end demand
for semiconductor products, SIA said.
</P>
<P>
According to the trade group, the America's market will remain
the world's largest in the next four years, with the Asia-Pacific
region, excluding Japan, gaining on the America's market. The
European market will be right behind Asia-Pacific, which has
gained momentum over the past couple of years. While Japan is
still recovering from the protracted domestic recession, it will
also experience double-digit growth, SIA said.

<HEADLINE> More Evidences Proving Japanese Invasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Sun Xinwu, an 82-year-old man in
northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, has donated 49 military
and administrative maps drawn by Japanese invaders during the
World War II.
</P>
<P>
"History could never be rewritten," Sun said, adding that "
these maps serve as iron-clad evidence proving Japanese invasion
of China during the 1930s and 1940s."
</P>
<P>
Sun has given the maps to the Memorial Hall of Northeast China
Revolutionary Martyrs in Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Penghan, a researcher with the Memorial Hall, has studied
the maps. He said that 38 of the 49 maps used to be confidential
data illustrating disposition of Japanese invading troops. Most of
the maps were drawn from 1932 to 1939.
</P>
<P>
Another Japanese-made atlas that Sun has kept for years even
incorporated the three Chinese provinces in the northeast into
Japanese territory.
</P>
<P>
In the neighboring Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, literary
historians have discovered a city map of Hohhot, capital of the
region, drawn by Japanese invaders in 1938 following their
occupation of the city in October, 1937.
</P>
<P>
The one-meter long and 0.75-meter wide map was found and bought
by an amateur at a second-hand book stall.
</P>
<P>
On July 7, 1937, the Japanese invaders attacked Lugou Bridge,
known as the Marco Polo Bridge in the southwest of today's Beijing,
and Chinese forces fought back.
</P>
<P>
This has been known as the Lugou Bridge Incident, which marked
the beginning of Japan's all-out invasion of China and China's
eight-year long War of Resistance Against Japan. The Japanese
invaders surrendered in 1945.
</P>
<P>
But Japan's rightist-wing forces have attempted to deny their
history of invasion of China, which has aroused the indignation of
the Chinese, especially the war victims and their relatives.

JAKARTA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Jakarta, capital of Indonesia, had
recorded 22 deaths from dengue fever out of 5,646 cases until May
15, an official said.
</P>
<P>
The number of fatalities this year was proportionally much
lower than over the same period last year, in which 23 people died
out of 1,488 cases, the Jakarta Post daily Thursday quoted Head of
the City Health Agency Ahmad Harjadi as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We held a public campaign to increase residents' awareness and
took preventative action like fumigating the 55 sub-districts most
prone to dengue fever," Harjadi said, adding that dengue cases
reached a peak this year in March.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the declining rate of rainfalls played a
significant role in helping stop the disease from spreading. He
also said that the city administration allocated more than one
billion rupiah (121,000 U.S. dollars) to prevent any outbreak.
</P>
<P>
In 1998's outbreak, official figure showed a total of 133

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urged to End Mandate, Withdraw KFOR From Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav government Wednesday
called on the U.N. Security Council to immediately end its special
peace-keeping mandate and mission in Kosovo and to allow the
return of Yugoslav troops to the troubled province in southwestern
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the government lashed out at the U.N. mission
and the NATO-led KFOR peacekeeping force for "failing to implement
the U.N. resolution 1244 and tolerating ethnic Albanian extremists.
"
</P>
<P>
It also demanded the Security Council take all necessary steps
as soon as possible to ensure the thorough implementation of
resolution 1244.
</P>
<P>
Since their deployment in Kosovo a year ago, the U.N. mission
and the KFOR have not only failed to earnestly carry out
resolution 1244, but also taken a tolerant stance toward the
ethnic Albanian extremists, which has led to an escalation of
terrorist activities in Kosovo, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
During the past year, it added, Albanian extremists launched
more than 5,000 terrorist attacks, leaving over 1,000 civilians
dead, 940 people abducted, and some 360,000 non-Albanian residents
displaced.
</P>
<P>
The extremists also burned more than 50,000 civilian houses and
severely damaged 86 churches built in the Middle Ages and other
precious historical sites.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the statement said, Kosovo has become a vital base
for drug-smuggling, arms-trafficking and money-laundering for
organized international criminal rings after some 250,000 ethnic
Albanians illegally entered the province from Albania and
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee the complete implementation of the U.N. resolution,
the Yugoslav government said, the Security Council should
immediately end the mandate of the special mission and withdraw
KFOR from Kosovo as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, it added, the council should allow Yugoslavia
to rush its troops and police force back to Kosovo to guard its
internationally-recognized borders and restore social order in the
province.
</P>
<P>
The mostly-Albanian Kosovo has been under the administration of
the U.N. mission since KFOR entered the area in June 1999,
following the withdrawal of Yugoslav troops from it.

<HEADLINE> Albania Urges Cooperation with KFOR in Combating Border Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Commander of the NATO-led
peacekeeping force in Kosovo (KFOR) Juan Ortuno visited Albania on
Wednesday and held talks with Albanian leaders on strengthening
cooperation in combating border crimes and on other issues.
</P>
<P>
During his brief visit, Ortuno met separately with Albanian
Prime Minister Ilir Meta, President Rexhep Meidani and Defense
Minister Luan Hajdaraga.
</P>
<P>
Meta called for better cooperation between his country and the
KFOR in containing the increasingly rampant crimes of trafficking
and illegal immigration across the Albanian border with Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He urged the KFOR to intensify its control over the area on the
side of Kosovo, a neighboring Yugoslav province, which has been
policed by NATO-led force following the end of the alliance's 78-
day bombing of Yugoslavia last year.
</P>
<P>
In their talks with the commander, the three Albanian leaders
all asked the KFOR to play an active role in helping their country
build highways, claiming that restoring the dilapidated highway
between the port city of Durres and the border town of Kukes was
of great significance not only for Albania but for the KFOR.
</P>
<P>
Ortuno, who also inspected NATO troops stationed in Durres,
promised that the Western forces would do their best despite their
limited abilities in this aspect.

ZAGREB, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Slovenia's Parliament approved a new
cabinet headed by interim Prime Minister Andrej Bajuk on Wednesday,
bringing an end to the nearly two-month government crisis in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Slovenian News Agency said the new cabinet was approved by
46 votes in favor to 44 against out of the 90 MPs. According to
Slovenian law, a new cabinet can be approved only by a majority of
the parliament with at least 46 ballots in its favor.
</P>
<P>
Slovenia's Parliament passed a non-confident motion against
former Prime Minister Janez Drnovesek's cabinet on April 8,
triggering a political crisis in the country. Bajuk, a banker, was
approved as interim prime minister by 46 ballots in his favor
after three rounds of voting in the parliament. His cabinet,
however, failed to win approval from the parliament on May 23 with
less than half of the favorable ballots required.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Forecasts 2 Percent GDP Growth for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian government Wednesday
announced a readjusted economic forecast for the year 2000,
raising the targeted GDP growth rate to 2 percent, twice the
figure anticipated in February.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine will witness an inflation rate of 18.5 percent in 2000
and its currency, hryvina, will be devalued from the current price
of 5.4 hryvina for one U.S. dollar to 6.2 hryvina for one dollar,
according to the figures released by the Ministry of Economy.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, the country's foreign reserve will
amount to 1.75 billion U.S. dollars, 60 percent higher than in
1999, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
In February, the government had forecast a lower growth with
less inflation for 2000, saying that the gross domestic product
would increase by 1 percent and the inflation rate would hit 15.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
In the first four months, Ukraine registered a GDP growth of 5.
5 percent and its foreign reserve now stands at nearly 1 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Italian Research Institute Casts Shadow on Economic Picture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Italy is well on its way toward
economic recovery, but this year's growth rate will stop short of
earlier forecasts of around 3 percent, the Italian Economic
Research Institute ISAE reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to ISAE, Italy's GDP is likely to grow about 2.6
percent this year, about one percentage point below the overall
euro zone growth estimate, and also lower than Tuesday's OECD
estimate which placed the growth rate at 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Production growth is strengthening this year thanks to a
gradual recovery of internal demand and a continued increase in
foreign demand," ISAE said.
</P>
<P>
Growth opportunities, according to the institute, are "good
enough to spark a relatively robust and lengthy period of
expansion," despite lagging private section consumption figures,
but they will not boost GDP growth above 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The gap between Italy's economic expansion and that of the euro
zone will close a bit in 2001, said the OECD, when GDP growth
should hit 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The main impetus for economic expansion will be increased
consumption and investments, which should take the place of
exports as the main GDP stimulus, which until now have been
bullish because of low euro-dollar exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
As the euro picks up speed, ISAE warned, inflationary pressure
will rear its head once again, bringing consumer price indexes up
as much as 2.5 percent this year, and a little under 2 percent
next.
</P>
<P>
ISAE also predicted that employment will jump about 1.1 percent
this year and 1.3 percent in 2001, resulting in respective
unemployment rates of 11 percent and 10.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
In its report, the economic institute said it expects the
deficit-to-GDP ratio to weigh in at about 1.4 percent this year,
slightly under the official target, and 1.2 percent the following
year.

BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Eight Leading Chinese mobile
communications equipment producers signed research and development
agreements with the American Qualcomm Corp. on intellectual
property rights of CDMA (Code Division Multi Address) to improve
the localization of the technology.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Daily, the eight companies include
Beijing-based Datang Telecom and Capital, Shenzhen-based Huawei
Technology and Zhongxing Telecom, Hangzhou-based Eastcom, Jinan-
based HiSense Group and Langchao group, Shanghai Lawton Technology
Group.
</P>
<P>
As licensees of Qualcomm, the Chinese companies are expected to
develop CDMA handsets and base station prototypes based on the IS-
95 A/B and 3G (third generation) 1X Multi-carrier standards.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also provides option to secure commercial
licenses of such products at any time during the term of the
research and development agreement, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
China Unicom, the second biggest domestic mobile communication
operator, had planned to provide CDMA services this summer after
the State Council authorized it last year to solely construct and
operate a CDMA network in the country.
</P>
<P>
Qualcomm is said to be the biggest winner from the deal, which
has long been interested in entering China, the Daily said.

<P>
BERLIN, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A late hat-trick from substitute Ulf
Kirsten helped Germany whitewash Liechtenstein 8-2 in Freiburg,
Germany on Wednesday in the final match before the European
champions begin their title defence.
</P>
<P>
The Germans put on a dismal showing until the closing stages
and the match was level at 2-2 in the 65th minute.
</P>
<P>
Striker Marco Bode then put the German team back in the lead
before Liechtenstein collapsed in the last 10 minutes, conceding
five goals -- three from Kirsten and two from teammate Carsten
Jancker.
</P>
<P>
The German team coach Erich Ribbeck said: "It's always hard to
play against so-called 'little' teams." "It was only when we
scored the third and fourth goals that we began to see that the
opposition was tiring."
</P>
<P>
Germany, who ended months of uninspired performances with a 3-2
victory over the Czech Republic on Saturday, will now travel to
their Euro 2000 base in the small Dutch town of Vaals where they

HEFEI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Hefei, capital of east China's Anhui

<P>
These enterprises used 20.39 million US dollars of overseas

</P>
<P>
The improvement of local investment environment is considered
the key factor leading to the growing inflow of overseas capital.

The city issued a regulation this year to offer better services
for overseas-funded enterprises through accepting supervision by
those firms and introducing measures of rewards and punishment.

WELLINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Government will
contribute about 200,000 NZ dollars (95,000 U.S. dollars) to the
disaster relief for the victims of the weekend quake in Indonesia,
which has so far killed more than 100 people.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Press Association (NZPA) Thursday quoted
Overseas Aid Minister Matt Robson as saying the money will be
given to the International Red Cross working in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The money will go toward immediate assistance such as shelter,
food and medical help," Robson said.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Government would continue to monitor the
situation and more funds might be given, he said, adding that he
is also considering if New Zealand earthquake experts should be
sent in to help with the disaster but also to gather information
for New Zealand's own earthquake preparedness.

<P>
WELLINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Foreign Minister
Phil Goff has ruled out a meeting with Fijian coup leader George
Speight when he visits Fiji as part of a Commonwealth mission this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
"I don't regard Mr. Speight as having any legitimacy," the
Dominion Thursday quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I regard Mr. Speight as a person that has acted unlawfully,
criminally and in a terrorist way and I don't believe that a
meeting with him should take place in a way that would give him
legitimacy or give him any confidence that he was respected or
acknowledged in any way by the international community," the
Wellington-based newspaper quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand foreign minister said the Commonwealth is
encouraged by Fiji's military's rejection of Speight as a
participant in a new government.
</P>
<P>
Goff's hastily arranged trip is part of a visit by the
Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, which suspended Fiji from
the councils of the Commonwealth Wednesday. The group is also
planning to visit the Solomon Islands on the way.

<HEADLINE> Body-suit Boost for British Swimmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Britain's top swimmers have been
given the go-ahead to wear the controversial body-suits during the
Olympic games.
</P>
<P>
The British Olympic Association had previously refused to
approve the new designs. But on Wednesday, the BOA announced those
participating at Sydney, would be allowed to choose their own
officially approved swimwear.
</P>
<P>
A new neck-to-ankle body suit sparked controversy when it was
used by a number of swimmers at the Australian Olympic trials -
some of whom recorded phenomenal times.
</P>
<P>
And last month, Dutch swimmer Inge de Bruin broke four world
records wearing the so-called 'fastskin' at a Grand Prix meeting.
</P>
<P>
The BOA had been criticised by the Amateur Swimming Federation
for "lacking clarity" on the issue.
</P>
<P>
But, speaking to BBC News Online, a BOA spokesman refuted the
allegation.
</P>
<P>
"The BOA has classified bodysuits as specialised equipment," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Wright Hangs up His Boots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Former Arsenal and England striker
Ian Wright has decided to hang up his boots, after a long and
distinguished career in professional football in which he earned
31 international caps.
</P>
<P>
Wright, who helped Burnley gain promotion to the First Division
last season, said it was "one of the hardest decisions he has had
to make in his life" and he wanted to spend more time with his
family.
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old said: "It's a really hard decision because I've
got all the people in Burnley, the manager is a close friend and I
've made really good friends up there."
</P>
<P>
In recent months Wright has begun to develop a new career in
television, hosting his own chat show, and he added: "My family
are the major factor in me not playing any more, plus I have had a
very good career and it is other people's turn now."

<HEADLINE> English 'Hooligans' Refused Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Two known English football hooligans
have been turned away by Dutch authorities after attempting to
travel to the Euro 2000 championships.
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary Jack Straw revealed one fan was refused entry at
Amsterdam's Schiphol airport and another at the Hook of Holland
ferry port.
</P>
<P>
England coach Kevin Keegan has told the home secretary he fears
trouble involving England fans during the tournament could
psychologically damage his squad.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the National Criminal Intelligence Service (
NCIS) in London, which will be manned around the clock during the
championship, said the troublemakers' names would be released
later on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Kevin Keegan told me that the last thing that the England
squad needed was for there to be trouble in the grounds or away
from the grounds with alleged England fans," said Straw.
</P>
<P>
"I say alleged because these people are not supporters, they
are a treachery to the game and they not only bring shame on the
nation but they are a large psychological distraction for the
England squad," he said.
</P>
<P>
Details of more than 500 supporters with domestic or
international bans have been given to the Dutch and Belgian
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Bryan Drew, head of strategic and special intelligence for NCIS,
said a hooligan hotline launched by Straw had been inundated with
calls since the violence in Copenhagen last month between Arsenal
and Galatasaray fans.
</P>
<P>
He said that names of 43 thugs had been given to intelligence
officers and their details passed to Dutch and Belgian authorities.
</P>
<P>
English supporters currently under domestic bans have been sent
letters warning that they risk being turned away if they try to
travel to Euro 2000.
</P>
<P>
Drew said: "This is the most extensive and sophisticated
operation we have ever mounted for a major overseas tournament."
</P>
<P>
Football intelligence officers from around the country have
been drafted into NCIS headquarters to help root out disruptive
fans before they reach the tournament and identify troublemakers
once they are there.
</P>
<P>
Police at the tournament would not hesitate to haul unruly
supporters before the courts and these fans will face further
prosecution when they return to this country, said Drew.
</P>
<P>
Hooligans could be banned from all football matches for 10
years, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Ten years out of football is an awful long time," said Drew.
</P>
<P>
While touring the NCIS headquarters, Straw was shown a "trophy
cabinet" containing weapons snatched from hooligans including
knuckledusters, knives, pepper gas and clubs.
</P>
<P>
The home secretary has already met Dutch and Belgian
ambassadors to discuss how to stop hooligans getting to the games.
</P>
<P>
New laws may allow Dutch and Belgian courts to carry out trials
on a daily basis, including weekends.
</P>
<P>
Local police forces have prepared holding cells in many cities,
which can accommodate up to 4,000 fans, while Belgian and Dutch
police have special powers to detain anyone threatening trouble.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Nigerian Motorists on Petrol Rush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
LAGOS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Motorists in Lagos Wednesday resorted
to panic buying of petrol to get prepared for possible closure of
filling stations when the nationwide "sit at home" strike against
petrol price hike is to begin Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Long lines were seen in front of a few gas stations still
filling their tanks in the largest city of Africa's largest oil
exporting country. Most gas stations remained closed although
they had the product, while the few still operating did so with
caution and suspicion, afraid of possible attack on their
property.
</P>
<P>
President of Nigeria Labor Congress Adams Oshiomhole Monday
directed all filling stations to close down "in their own
interest" or operate "at their own risk".
</P>
<P>
He also asked workers to ignore the stations until there was a
reversion to the old price regime, urging them to mobilize for
Thursday's strike "so that by then, the whole nation will be
totally grounded."
</P>
<P>
The fuel crisis started last Thursday when the Nigerian
government increased the country's petrol price by 50 percent to
30 naira (100 naira equals about one U. S. dollar) per liter.
</P>
<P>
The decision had met with mixed reactions in the country.
People in the business sector generally welcomed the move despite
the costs added to their operation, saying it is inevitable to
reduce the huge amount of money spent on subsidizing for a low
petrol price.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with the labor leaders in a bid to prevent the
imminent strike, Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo Tuesday
defended the government's decision to raise the petrol price,
saying the money freed from subsidization is badly needed for
alleviating the country's poor.
</P>
<P>
He told Oshiomhole at a meeting that the annual subsidy for a
low petrol price may amount to a formidable sum of 202 billion
naira (2.02 billion U. S. dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
The president said that average Nigerians did not really
benefit from the subsidy, which if reduced he would guarantee a 25
percent wage increase next year, and quicker steps in poverty
alleviation at all levels.
</P>
<P>
He promised that he would consider alleviating measures for the
hike and will not hesitate in continuing dialogues with trade
unions, students and other interest groups on the issue.
</P>
<P>
However, Oshiomhole, who led a 23-man NLC delegation to the
meeting, expressed his "disappointment" with the president after
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He argued that Nigeria's economy is "generator-riven" due to
the inefficiency of the country's power plants. As a result, the
petrol price increase may lead to a situation where goods produced
in Nigeria would be costly while imported goods will be cheaper,
thus leading to retrenchment of workers.
</P>
<P>
The country has since last Thursday been shocked by increasing
violent demonstrations. In the country's most developed
southeastern region, college students spearheaded the relatively
peaceful demonstrations, while in other areas, some protesters set
up road blocks causing traffic holdup and even clashed with the
police.
</P>
<P>
In the capital, protesting workers Tuesday blocked the main
access road to the presidential villa and barred government clerks
from entering their offices.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Preparations for General Elections in Tanzania Underway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zhang Dacheng
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Preparatory work such as
registration forms, posters, ballot papers and education material
for the general elections to be held in October this year in
Tanzania are well underway.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the National Electoral Commission (NEC) Judge Lewis
Makame told the donor community here on Wednesday that the
preparations for presidential, parliamentary and civic elections
would be a challenge to his commission as they would be held
simultaneously throughout the country on October 29.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, so far the donor support, or the
Basket Fund as it is known, has been only 8.8 percent of a total
budget amounting to 42 billion Tanzanian shillings or 52.5 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The government performance in funding this year's elections is
also slow compared to the 1995 elections as meager funds have been
released so far," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Makame assured the donors that his commission would
deal with any bleach of the law so as to fully guarantee the
elections to be held in a fair, reasonable way.
</P>
<P>
"Voters who will support more than one candidate would be shed
and that there would be secret water mark on the ballot papers to
distinguish them from the fake ones if there would be any," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The NEC chairman stressed the importance of his commission
working closely with all political parties and the media's fair
and free access to all political parties.
</P>
<P>
This year's general elections will involve the union
presidential candidates, aspirants for membership of parliament
and councilorship, and the Zanzibar presidential candidates, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The NEC on Tuesday issued a draft code of conduct for the
upcoming general elections, banning government and ruling party
leaders from using their power for political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
The code stipulates that during the campaign period, leaders of
the government and the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) are not
allowed to use state planes, vehicles, offices and government rest
houses during campaigning tours.
</P>
<P>
The government should ensure that its state organs will provide
security to all political parties during campaigning rallies,
demonstrations and elections and has to respect election results,
the code said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the government is also required to
ensure its state media organs provide equal opportunity to all
political parties and assist the media in providing the public
correct and balanced information.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the code warned the political parties and religious
leaders against using churches and mosques for campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Political parties are not allowed to campaign along ethnic
lines or use vernaculars, the code said, adding that the languages
to be used in their campaigns should be English and Kiswahili.
</P>
<P>
The code prohibits the carrying of any kind of weapon in
political rallies, meetings and demonstrations, saying no party is
allowed to conduct meetings or demonstrations in areas close to
where another party is holding its meeting.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania had its first general elections in 1995, but the
forthcoming one will be the first time in the country's
post-independence history for presidential, parliamentary and
civic elections to be held simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
All the 13 fully registered political parties will run for the
elections which are likely to be dominated by the ruling CCM, at
least on the mainland as President Benjamin Mkapa, who won the
1995 elections, is expected to win him a second five-year term.
</P>
<P>
The fully registered political parties include the Civic United
Front, which is the main opposition party in Zanzibar, the
National Convention for Construction and Reform, the United
Democratic Party, Chama Cha Demokrasia na Maendeleo, the Union for
Multi-party Democracy and Tanzania People's Party.
</P>
<P>
Others include the National League for Democracy, the National
Reconstruction Alliance, Tanzania Democratic Alliance, Tanzania
Labour Party, Popular National Party and United People's
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
According to a timetable issued by the NEC early this year, the
 registration of voters will be conducted between August 1 and 21
while the nomination of contestants will be made on August 13,
with the election campaigns set between August 14 and October 28.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Govt Attacks U.S. Envoy for Violating Diplomatic Norms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Zanzibar government has
attacked recent statements made by U.S. Ambassador to Tanzania
Reverend Stith regarding the choice of the next Zanzibar
president.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy is said, in a recent interview with a British
Broadcasting Corporation program, Focus on Africa, to have
portrayed Zanzibar President Salmin Amour, whose second term will
expire in October, as "a lame duck".
</P>
<P>
"This is totally against diplomatic norms," the government said
in a statement issued on Tuesday night, expressing further concern
over Stith's remarks that Zanzibar could be another Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar was also displeased with Stith's violation of
diplomatic ethics by "often entering Zanzibar without informing
the Zanzibar office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
International Cooperation", the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar has requested foreign envoys accredited to Tanzania to
abide by diplomatic norms and refrain from intervening in
Tanzania's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The semi-autonomous Zanzibar region in the Indian Ocean joined
with mainland Tanganyika to form the United Republic of Tanzania
after a revolt in 1964 that ousted the sultan and Omani Arabs who
ruled the island.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Can Play in Euro 2000: Belgian Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A court in Belgium ruled on
Wednesday that Yugoslavia can play in the coming 2000 European
Soccer Championship.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled against a demand handed in by Brussels-based
Albanians from the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Pierre Jacques, a Belgian lawyer acting on behalf of the
Kosovar Albanians, said that an appeal had been lodged with the
European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union.
</P>
<P>
"We have already sent a complaint to EC President Romano Prodi
on the grounds Belgium has violated the EU treaty," said the
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovar Albanians residing in Belgium claimed that Yugoslav
participation in the Euro 2000 contravenes EU sanctions enforced
during last year's Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
But the sanctions were only targeted toward the economy of the
Balkan country and a travel ban added later on only sorted out the
high-ranking officials of the government.
</P>
<P>
Belgian foreign minister officials said last week that there
was no reason to refuse issuing travel visas to Yugoslav players
who are not on the banned list.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Netherlands, the co-hosts of this
year's championship, said that should Belgium refuse the entry of
Yugoslavia, the Balkan nation can play its matches on Dutch soil
instead.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, Yugoslavia, though finished atop of group
preliminaries, was banned from participating in the then European
soccer championship. The ban was announced only 10 days prior to
the kick-off by the Union of the European Football Associations(
UEFA), the governing body of the sport in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Denmark replaced Yugoslavia in the 1992 tournament and went as
far as taking the trophy by beating Germany two goals to nil in
the grand finale.
</P>
<P>
The UEFA, however, did not say anything so far this time around
as regards a ban on Yugoslav players.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia was drawn to play with Slovenia, Norway and Spain in
Group C in the forthcoming tourney. The Yugoslavs are to meet
Slovenia on June 13 at Charleroi, Belgium.

<HEADLINE> Keegan Backs Shearer and Seaman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- England manager Kevin Keegan
shrugged off recent criticism of his captain Alan Shearer and
goalkeeper David Seaman in the last press conference before
England leave for Euro 2000, restating his support for both
players.
</P>
<P>
Asked about a recent Internet poll that found a 72 per cent
majority against including Shearer in the starting XI, Keegan said:
"I don't take too much notice of these polls.
</P>
<P>
"I have always said if Alan Shearer is fit, he will play," he
added.
</P>
<P>
When questioned about comments from the Portuguese camp
suggesting Seaman and his defence were a weak link, Keegan said he
was treating the remarks as kidology on Portugal's part and was
not taking them too seriously.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously they are looking at us from their point of view," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We have done the same and they have weaknesses as well as
strengths. Those words can be used to build a spirit and
togetherness but I wouldn't say it will motivate us."
</P>
<P>
"I would hope they cannot be motivated any more than they
already are. This is a major tournament and that should be enough,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Keegan also confirmed that Shearer and full-back Gary Neville
missed Wednesday's practice, although neither have serious
injuries and both would be available for selection for Monday's
opening clash against Portugal.
</P>
<P>
On the subject of Shearer, Keegan said he did not know, or care,
why his captain continued to be the target of criticism.
</P>
<P>
"People have a right to their opinions, but they're just not on
the same wavelength as me," he said.

<HEADLINE> UK Women Underpaid and Overworked: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- More than three quarters of working
women in Britain say they are disillusioned with their jobs,
research revealed on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Most of them are stressed, while 93 percent of working mothers
find it difficult to juggle a career with family life, according
to the survey of 5,000 women in the UK.
</P>
<P>
But the office romance is alive and well. One-in-three women
admitted to a sexual relationship with a male colleague while 12
percent said they had had a fling with their boss.
</P>
<P>
Many of those questioned said they were overworked, underpaid
and at "breaking point" from stress, causing them to shout at
their children.
</P>
<P>
Three-out-of-four women believe their health is suffering
because of career stress.
</P>
<P>
About 77 percent feel they have to work much harder than men to
gain promotion, even though they feel they have better
communication and organizational skills.
</P>
<P>
Working mothers feel they are emotionally damaging their
children and putting their own health at risk by working. Three-
out-of-four believe that career stress is causing their health to
suffer.
</P>
<P>
Those questioned blamed a lack of support from both their
managers and their partners for their problems.
</P>
<P>
The survey reveals that women are finding it equally difficult
both at home and in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
At home, women are continuing to do the bulk of the household
chores.
</P>
<P>
Even where both they and their partners are working, 80 percent
say they do most of the housework and have the main responsibility
for their children.
</P>
<P>
And four-out-of-five say being a working mother emotionally
damages their children while more than half say they have shouted
at their children because they felt stressed.
</P>
<P>
At work, women feel they have to work much harder than men to
get promotion and many believe having a baby damages their career
prospects.
</P>
<P>
A large proportion think they are underpaid and 62 percent
believe they are overworked. Just one-in-five is happy with their
career choice.
</P>
<P>
Maureen Moore, a stress management trainer in Hertfordshire,
suggested women could reduce their stress levels by working less.
</P>
<P>
The survey, carried out for women's magazine Top Sante also
reveals that many believe their female colleagues are 'their worst
enemies in the workplace'.
</P>
<P>
A majority believes their female bosses are the hardest
taskmasters and most say working women are more aggressive than
men.
</P>
<P>
Four-out-of-five women say they would give up their jobs if
they did not need the money.

<HEADLINE> Luxembourg Hostage Taker Accused of Wrongdoing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The gun-wielding hostage taker who
stirred up sensation at Wasserbillig last Wednesday was accused by
Luxembourg police of several wrongdoings, a communique said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The gunman, Neji Bejaoui, was accused of illegal imprisonment
and sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old Tunisian-born immigrant last Wednesday walked
into a day-care center wielding a pistol, a hand grenade and a
knife and took as hostage 43 children aged between two and seven
and five female adult teachers.
</P>
<P>
The man demanded being flown to Libya with a ransom of 20
million francs (220,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
After a 28-hour face-off, Luxembourg police coaxed the gunman
into a pretended television interview and shot twice in the gunman
's head to end the hostage crisis at Wasserbillig bordering
Germany.
</P>
<P>
The gunman was sent to hospital for treatment and is now out of
life-threatening danger.
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg police accused the gunman of illegal imprisonment
and sexual harassment. The gunman was said to have raped one of
the teachers during the stand-off with the police. He also beat up
other teachers of the nursery school.
</P>
<P>
Bejaoui, having a history of mental problems, released 18 of
the children and two of the teachers he had taken hostage after he
had talked with his psychiatrist late last Wednesday.

The FAA sent directives to airlines and airports to strengthen
procedures for verifying the credentials of officers who need to

</P>
<P>
Police accompanying prisoners or traveling for other official
purposes sometimes need to carry their weapons. But a recent

that law enforcement credentials can be easily obtained.

"The law enforcement agencies are working with us to create a
new counterfeit-proof credential, but in the meantime, we're
intensifying airport and air carrier checks required for officers
carrying arms," said Cathal Flynn, the FAA's associate
administrator for civil aviation security.

<HEADLINE> Southeast U.S. Suffers Through Drought Unlike Any in Generations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the Atlanta metropolitan area, the state has imposed tough
water-use restrictions for the first time in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
Across the Southeast, farmers are watching their crops wither
in the fields, and cattle are being sent to the slaughterhouse now
because soon there may be nothing for the animals to eat.
</P>
<P>
The Southeast is in the grip of a drought the likes of which
some states have not seen in generations, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
The drought extends from South Carolina through Georgia,
Alabama, Florida, Gulf Coast Louisiana and parts of West Texas.
</P>
<P>
Along Florida's Gulf Coast, it has been the driest spring since
at least 1915, when records were first kept. The drought index in
some counties there rivals that of Arizona's deserts, and tourists
are being asked to use their towels twice so hotel laundry rooms
can save water.
</P>
<P>
Georgia has posted the driest May this year since 1895. Some
streams have run dry and rivers are at record lows.
</P>
<P>
In South Carolina, farmers have stopped planting cotton and
soybeans. And in Alabama, produce farmer Mike Donnell has seen his
crops die in the field and had to feed his prize tomatoes, ruined
by dry rot, to the hogs.

<HEADLINE> CIA Agents Testify at Lockerbie Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Two CIA agents
appeared in court on Thursday to testify against the two Libyans
accused of bombing the Pan Am Flight 103 in December 1988.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time covert operatives testified, though
behind drawn curtains, in the mass murder trial against the two
Libyan nationals accused of killing 259 people on board the New
York-bound airliner and 11 others when the downed plane hit the
ground.
</P>
<P>
Both agents said that they had inspected weapons confiscated
from two unidentified men at Dakar airport in Senegal on February
20, 1988, just 10 months prior to the mid-air explosion disaster.
</P>
<P>
They said that the electronic detonation timers were similar to
the detonator the prosecution believed to have been used to bring
down the Boeing 747 jumbo.
</P>
<P>
British investigator William Williamson said in court that the
fingernail-sized circuit board fragment found on the ground near
the crash site at Lockerbie matched the timers confiscated in
Dakar.
</P>
<P>
The timers were described as belonging to the model of MST-13
and investigators traced the circuit board fragment to a Swiss
manufacturer in Zurich known as MEBO A.G..
</P>
<P>
The indictment said that the two Libyans, Abdel Basset Ali al-
Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, had ordered 60 electronic
detonation timers from MEBO in 1985 and 1988.
</P>
<P>
If found guilty, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa
Fhimah would be sentenced to life imprisonment and would serve
their jail term in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
If found not guilty or the court could not prove the case
against them, the two accused would be set free.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited trial is expected to last up to a year and the
court holds sessions almost daily except for a summer recess
between July 28 and August 22.

<HEADLINE> Italy Urges Iraq to Accept UN Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Italian Premier Giuliano Amato urged
Iraq to accept a United Nations resolution which would loosen
decade-long sanctions on the country, in a meeting here Thursday
with Iraqi Parliament Speaker Saddoun Hammadi, on his second visit
to a European country in less than a month.
</P>
<P>
Amato urged Iraq to "give proof " of its "flexibility" and "
realism by accepting the UN resolution conditions which, in turn
for suspended international economic sanctions, requires stepped-
up collaboration from Baghdad in the UN arms inspections program.
</P>
<P>
Hammadi is in Rome on invitation from the Italian Lower House,
in a visit aimed at briefing Italian MPs and officials on the
impact of international sanctions and U.S. and British air strikes
on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Western war planes began enforcing no-fly zones over parts of
Iraq in 1992 to protect Shi'ite Moslems in the south and, in 1996,
a Kurdish enclave in the north. Hammadi stressed that the long
years of sanctions have had grave effects on health and education,
and said that the UN resolution "risks taking us back to the 1991
arms inspection situation, without keeping in mind the inspections
which have happened over the past nine years."
</P>
<P>
In a note issued from the premier's office, Italy insisted that
acceptance of the resolution would still be the best move, and
that "a balanced activation of resolution 1284 would build a
climate of greater trust with the United Nations, making it
therefore possible, in a short period of time, to remove every
impediment to revoking the sanctions."
</P>
<P>
Talking to journalists after meeting with Italian leaders,
Hammadi claimed that the sanctions against his country were in
place purely for political reasons, given that Iraq had recognized
Kuwait and pledged to live in peace with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
As for Saddam's refusal to accept the return of the inspectors,
he said that "everything that was to be checked has already been
checked" by 3,558 inspectors in 264 missions at 2,558 sites, plus
a 24-hour automatic control system on another 386 sites.
</P>
<P>
He said that "every seven minutes a child dies" because of the
embargo.
</P>
<P>
According to UNICEF, he said, every month 5,000 children under
5 die for avoidable reasons including dehydration.
</P>
<P>
Asked about Iraq's refusal to accept UN Resolution 1284 and
Premier Amato's call to accept it, Hammadi replied that the
Italian leaders recognized that there are very murky points in the
resolution.

MEXICO CITY, June 8 (Xinhua)-- World Health Organization (WHO)

</P>
<P>
General Director of WHO, Gro Harlem Brundtland, said that in

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council on
Thursday reiterated its call on Eritrea and Ethiopia to stop
hostilities immediately and concentrate on diplomatic efforts to
resolve their border conflict.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued after informal consultations, the
Council renewed its strong and continuous support for the efforts
by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in finding a peaceful
solution of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Deploring the continuation of fighting in particular near the
port of Assab, Eritrea, it appealed to the two parties for full
cooperation aimed at an early and positive conclusion of the
proximity talks in Algiers.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks for an end to the two-year border war between the
Horn of Africa neighbors began last Tuesday in the Algerian
capital of Algiers under the OAU auspices. No breakthrough has
been achieved so far.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak of war in May 1998 over a border poorly demarcated
after Eritrea's independence in 1993, has reportedly cost over 100,
000 lives.
</P>
<P>
Fighting was renewed on May 12 this year. Five days later, the
Security Council imposed an arms embargo on the two countries for
12 months.

<HEADLINE> EU to Continue Microsoft Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Union said on
Thursday that it was still too early to predict the implications
of a United States court ruling to break up computer software
giant Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever happens, it will obviously have implications for our
investigation," said European Commission spokesperson Amelia
Torres. "But we have to see what the final ruling is first."
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the European Union and
watchdog for the 15-nation bloc, has been probing whether
Microsoft's Windows 2000 software could break EU competition rules
by giving the American company a stranglehold over server software
and ultimately e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
EU investigators are probing charges that Microsoft has bundled
its Windows 2000 operating system with its own server software and
other Microsoft products in such a way that only Microsoft
products are thoroughly interoperable.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled on Wednesday
that Microsoft should be broken in two and labeled the company as"
untrustworthy" for abusing its dominant position in the personal
computer operating system software market.
</P>
<P>
The commission spokesperson said that the commission never
comments on U.S. court rulings but added that Mario Monti,
European competition commissioner, had congratulated the American
Justice Department on the work done.

UFITCO coordinator Maximiliano Rusconi explained that the entry

evasion within Nation Bank of Argentina framework.

He affirmed this tax evasion could come to about 11 million
dollars in taxes to earnings and in VAT, when IBM took off money
used on the bribery payment.
</P>
<P>
This non-documented money would be of invoices IBM presented

Dini, the ministry reported, voiced his appreciation for
Tunisia's most recent efforts to give a boost to the process of
North African integration and to try and jump start the Maghreb
Arab Union (MAU), both of which the Italian diplomatic chief said
were of great importance for consolidating the Barcelona Euro-
Mediterranean process and for cooperation between the two shores
of the basin.
</P>
<P>
Dini also highlighted the positive state of bilateral
collaboration citing the examples of the olive oil sector, for
which the two foreign ministers agreed to boost the exchange of
experience and dialogue; fishing for which a number of joint
ventures are being developed along with measures for confidence
and monitoring; industrial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
For this latter sector, Tunis sees Italy as its "natural"
partner, as proven by the significant trade between the two
countries and the high level of collaboration even on the level of
small and medium-sized businesses.
</P>
<P>
Turning his attention of the Charter for Mediterranean Security,
Dini said that Italy considers this a top priority in the
framework of Euro-Mediterranean relations.
</P>
<P>
Looking at Euro-Mediterranean relations in general, the foreign
ministry statement said, both ministers agreed that this must be
kept separate from the Mideast peace process while Libya should be

is not in conflict with its own policy for the development of
African unity.

LOS ANGELES, June 8 (Xinhua) -- More than 25 million children
in the United States are on the Internet, three times the number
of kids who were online in 1997, according to a report released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This presents 40 percent of American children between two and
17 years old, said the report from U.S. market research firm
Grunwald Associates which interviewed more than 1,700 parents of
children aged 2-17 and 600 children aged 9-17 from the same
households.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that teenagers are online the most, with 70
percent accessing the Net regularly. It also found that 14 million
children go online from school, while nearly 18 million children
are online from home.
</P>
<P>
By 2005, the report predicts, almost 44 million children ages
two to 17 will be using the Internet. Children's access from
school is expected to surpass home access by 2003 as classroom
wiring initiatives kick in.
</P>
<P>
The report said that family decisions to purchase Internet
access and computers are centered on children's education and
learning. Children also cited education as the leading activity
while on the Net.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- NATO waited on Thursday for
details of Russia's proposal for a joint anti-missile defense
system though the United States said the Russian plan could not
replace the American system.
</P>
<P>
The defense ministers from the member states of the western
military alliance, who met here on Thursday for their semi-annual
council, were hoping Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev would
bring with him details of the proposal raised by Russian President
Vlamidir Putin.
</P>
<P>
The defense ministers of Russia and NATO are scheduled to meet
on Friday for a joint council.
</P>
<P>
Russia as well as some European allies of NATO oppose the
American plan to deploy a limited missile system aimed at
intercepting incoming missiles fired by what the United States
described as rogue states.
</P>
<P>
Russia argued that the U.S. missile deployment plan is a threat
to European security because it could be expanded to defeat a
Russian missile attack.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president has warned that his country would pull
out of all the nuclear arms agreement if the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile treaty is breached. He countered with a proposal to
cooperate with NATO on a missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
A final test of the American national missile defense system is
scheduled for early July and U.S. President Bill Clinton will
decide in autumn whether to go ahead with deploying such a system.

SANTIAGO, June 8 (Xinhua)--Two trains going in opposite
directions collided Thursday at dawn in small Niquen station,
Chile, situated 40 kilometers from Chillion (Biobio) city, leaving
10 injured.
</P>
<P>
A train was traveling from Concepcion city (7th Region) to
Santiago with 79 passengers and was finishing taking a siding at
the station's shunting yard, when it was hit in the back by the
other one with 115 passengers, that traveled from this capital
toward Temuco (Araucania) city.
</P>

This convoy going north was only hit on the last wagon, the
sleeping carriage, that had no passengers. Two last wagon-coaches
turned over, but these trains' solid metallic structure prevented
greater tragedy.

with the federal government is far from over.
