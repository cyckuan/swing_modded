<HEADLINE> Iran's Top Security Body Condemns Crackdown on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme National Security
Council (SNSC) on Saturday condemned the bloody crackdown on
university students by the country's conservative-dominated
security forces (police).
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after an emergency session, the SNSC
promised that the official who ordered the security forces to
enter the university dormitory to crack down students would be
immediately dismissed and be dealt with according to the law of
the nation.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the incident "is not acceptable and
cannot be ignored and forgotten," the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The SNSC has taken measures to form a special committee to
closely probe into the matter, its causes as well as obvious and
hidden factors behind it and to detect the elements of "pressure
groups" involved in unlawful acts, it said.
</P>
<P>
Iranian anti-riot police forced into Tehran University
dormitory to crack down the students who staged a rally
protesting the newly-approved press law and the ban of the
popular moderate daily Salam (Hello).
</P>
<P>
It was the most violent clash in the country since the Islamic
revolution in 1979. Eyewitnesses said that seven students were
killed, over 300 injured and 500 arrested during the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the mediation efforts by a number of ministers,
including the Interior Minister Abdolvahed Musavi Lari and
Minister of Culture and Higher Education Mostafa Moin, the unrest
continued until Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Moin on Saturday submitted his resignation to President
Khatami in a protest to the violent crackdown on students at
university dormitory.
</P>
<P>
Over 10,000 university students gathered a sit-in Saturday
morning in front of Tehran University to protest the crackdown
and call for immediate inquiry into the incident.
</P>
<P>
The students on Saturday night closed the street nearby the
Tehran University dormitory and hundreds of students and local
people still gathered inside and nearby the dormitory mosque.
</P>
<P>
The presiding board of Tehran University conditioned
continuation of its activities on restoration of the prestige,
status and honor of the hurt students, release of the arrested
students and immediate dismissal of the police commander.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, students in several provinces also announced their
support for Tehran University students and demanded immediate
probe into the crackdown.

<HEADLINE> Harare City Council Workers Strike For Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Harare City Council workers from
all departments demonstrated at town house on Saturday demanding
that the local authority pays them salary increments of between 20
and 45 percent back- dated to January, this year.
</P>
<P>
The workers said they will not go back to work until their
grievances were resolved.
</P>
<P>
Workers' committee chairman Cosmas Bungu told the Zimbabwe News
Agency that the commission running council affairs headed by
Elijih Chanakira has already told the workers that it could only
afford to pay the workers a 15 percent salary increase.
</P>
<P>
Bungu said council workers rejected the 15 percent increase
because it was a "disadvantage" to some council workers in lower
grades.
</P>
<P>
He said, municipal workers have since last year lived in
poverty but kept on working because they did not want to disrupt
the operations of the council.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Council authorities shall clean the streets, toilets
and do other odd jobs we were doing if they do not give us the
salary increases because we are not going back to work."

<HEADLINE> Security Council Hails DRC Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Saturday said in a press statement that the 15-nation body
welcomed a peace agreement on the ceasefire in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC), which is due to be signed Saturday in
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Council welcomed the progress made so far by
the parties concerned and strongly encouraged them to sign the
agreement as soon as possible," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after the Security Council met in a
closed-door session to discuss the latest developments in the
DRC.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which turned out to be a rare weekend session,
heard the briefing by the U.N. Secretariat on the ceasefire
agreement, which is aimed to end the 11-month war in the African
country.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, hammered out in 13 days of tough talks in the
Zambian capital, said the United Nations Security Council, in
collaboration with the Organization of African Unity, would be
asked to create and deploy a peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who is currently on his
African tour, said in Dakar Wednesday that the United Nations was
ready to send observers to the DRC as soon as the heads of state
signed the peace accord and that peacekeepers could follow
quickly.
</P>
<P>
The conflict in the DRC broke out in August last year after
mutinous soldiers, backed by Uganda and Rwanda, took up arms to
topple President Laurent Kabila, who is supported by Angola,
Namibia and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Sinn Fein Hits out at Blair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein, the political wing of
the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in Northern Ireland, has accused
British Prime Minister Tony Blair of using a "tidal wave of spin"
to try to persuade the Ulster Unionists Party (UUP) to accept the
latest peace plan.
</P>
<P>
Assembly member Gerry Kelly of Sinn Fein on Saturday said it
bore no relationship to the Good Friday Agreement, and that
republican anger was growing.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's political parties are keeping lines of
communication open this weekend as they sacruntize the proposed
peace plan, the UK and Irish governments' Way Forward document.
</P>
<P>
They are trying to resolve the impasse over decommissioning,
which is causing the current political deadlock. The deadline for
reaching a political consensus, and then implementing the Good
Friday Agreement, is next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But Kelly accused Blair of encouraging the type of stalling
that the unionists had engaged in during the past year.
</P>
<P>
He said Sinn Fein had brought the republican movement to the
political path and signed up to the Good Friday Agreement. But he
felt that unionism and the UK Government were "undermining the
whole argument about politics because they are not implementing
agreement which was agreed".
</P>
<P>
The accusations came as Belfast Orangemen were told they could
hold their annual 12 July demonstration in a public park near the
nationalist Lower Ormeau Road.
</P>
<P>
The signs from the unionists over the peace plan are not
particularly encouraging either. On Friday, they said the plan was
"fundamentally unfair and unbalanced" at a meeting that failed to
reach a decision.
</P>
<P>
UUP leader David Trimble said it did not ensure that the IRA
disarms before Sinn Fein takes up seats in an all-party executive.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to keep working in our contacts with the
British Government, the SDLP and with others, through the weekend
to try and achieve the objectives that we have stated here," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Blair, Prescott Counter Rift Rumors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
and his deputy John Prescott on Saturday moved to end reports of a
rift between them, with both warning party members to stay unified
if they want Labour to win a second term in office.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to a Labour rally in Scarborough, Blair praised
John Prescott and the public servants he accused of being
resistant to change earlier this week, saying that modern public
services were "the key" to what he wanted to achieve in
government.
</P>
<P>
"It is because this government believes in public service,
because we recognize its potential that we will always be the
friends of the good and the enemy of the second rate," a BBC
report quoted Blair as saying.
</P>
<P>
Blair paid tribute to the "vast majority of people in our
public services who are working with the government to deliver
real change at every level".
</P>
<P>
He added that Prescott shared his vision of "a vibrant,
popular, confident public service delivering to the people of this
country".
</P>
<P>
Blair pledged that the government would not return to the days
of old Labour administrations where there was tension between
ministers and grassroots members.
</P>
<P>
Prescott insisted Labour was a coalition of both the left and
right, saying that to make lasting changes to society the party
had to win a second term with Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
Reports of a rift between Blair and Prescott began on Tuesday
when the prime minister strayed from a prepared text at a meeting
with entrepreneurs to hit out at resistance to change in the
public sector. The following day, Prescott chose a local
government conference to praise the dedication of public sector
employees.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's speeches were the first in a series of addresses by
senior ministers over the next few weeks, designed to spell out
the Labor government's position after two years in office.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Central Bank Rules out Change of Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The governor of the Central Bank of
Egypt (CBE) on Saturday ruled out a move proposed by the currency
authorities to lower the exchange rate of the Egyptian pound
against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a press symposium on the capital market held in
Borg al Arab, Alexandria, Ismail Hassan said Egypt does not suffer
from structural imbalances in the economy and therefore need not
reduce the exchange rate of the pound.
</P>
<P>
Hassan stressed that there is no foreign currency crisis in
Egypt when CBE has a foreign currency reserve of 28.7 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian banks are carrying out their business as usual,
offering loans and financing projects, he said, adding that there
is a surplus in foreign currency in Egypt and the banks' financial
positions are balanced.
</P>
<P>
Hassan put Egypt's foreign debts at 28.1 billion dollars. The
burden of the debts is limited as the debts are required to be
paid back in a time span till the year of 2026, he said.
</P>
<P>
The CBE governor said the dollar problem appeared in Egypt when
its revenues of tourism dropped due to the 1997 killing of 58
foreign tourists in the southern resort of Luxor and the decline
in oil proceeds caused by low oil prices in the world market.
</P>
<P>
The market witnessed a rise in the exchange rate of the dollar
in the past period, which was caused by an increased demand for
the dollar, in addition to manipulation by some exchange
companies in the dollar "and some wrong practices by a number of
banks," Hassan said.
</P>
<P>
"But we have a (foreign currency) reserve to face such
temporal developments," he said, pointing out that the Egyptian
tourism is in a process of revival and the oil prices have risen
to a higher level in the world markets.

<HEADLINE> Russian Abstains From OSCE Vote on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The delegation from Russia
abstained Saturday from voting on a resolution concerning
Yugoslavia at the eighth annual session of the Parliamentary
Assembly of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
"We disagree with the tone used in discussing this problem,"
Duma Chairman and head of the Russian delegation, Gennady
Seleznyov said.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia opposes the U.S.-sponsored amendment which urges
"all countries to arrest the people accused by the International
Tribunal for former Yugoslavia and promptly hand them over to the
tribunal," the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The amendment calls for imposing sanctions against any country
that shields such people from arrest.
</P>
<P>
The assembly, therefore, "a priori handed down a guilty verdict
on the Yugoslav authorities," Seleznyov said, stressing that
Russia "disagrees with such a one-sided assessment before a court
rules."
</P>
<P>
The list of "suspects with regard to Yugoslavia must be
expanded to include the chief hand in the NATO aggression, (NATO
Secretary General) Mr. (Javier) Solana," he said.
</P>
<P>
The five-day OSCE session ended Saturday with a final
declaration reflecting recommendations worked out by the
parliamentarians from 54 countries.
</P>
<P>
The next annual session will be held in Bucharest in July 2000.

<HEADLINE> Accurate Medicine Information For Public Urged In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 10 (Xinhua) -- zimbabwean Health and Child Welfare
Minister Timothy Stamps Saturday called on the government, the
pharmaceutical industry, educators, health professionals, care
providers and the media to impart accurate, useful and unbiased
information on medicine to the public.
</P>
<P>
Officially launching the 1999 Zimbabwe National Medicines week
in Harare, Stamps said accurate information was to everyone's
advantage as it would cut down on problems associated with
inappropriate use of medication.
</P>
<P>
"Improper medicines can have serious health and economic
consequences well beyond the confines of a health facility and its
patients or clients, to the community and indeed the country at
large," he said.
</P>
<P>
Stamps said there was need to dispel the belief that there was
a "pill for every ill".
</P>
<P>
"We must aim for an educated client for medicines, a public
that is aware of the benefits of medicines when they are used
correctly but equally knowledgeable about the hazards associated
with the misuse of these substances," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 National Medicines week was focused on the theme, "the
right to unbiased medicines information".
</P>
<P>
The last national medicines week was launched in march, 1997 as
the ministry's initiative with help from stake-holders in the
field following the realization of shortcomings in the existing
information, education and communication channels in place on the
use of medicines.

GAZA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will
meet Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak Sunday on "the framework of
future relations between Israel and the Palestinians," said
Arafat's Advisor Nabil Abu Redinah here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Redinah made the remarks in an interview with Voice of

</P>
<P>
The meeting will take place at the Erez crossing, the entrance
to the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will also discuss ways to implement signed
agreements. Israeli radio has said the two sides will meet again
after Barak returns from his visit to Washington, which is to
start in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Redinah renewed the Palestinian call for
implementing Wye River agreement and halting the settlement
activities to pave the way for immediate talks between the two
sides for a permanent settlement.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
who was defeated by Barak in May elections, signed the Wye River
agreement last October, under which Israel should have pulled out
from another 13.1 percent of the West Bank by the end of January.
But Netanyahu government suspended the agreement in early December.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Barak's attitude toward the Palestinian
statehood, Redinah said "the comprehensive peace in the Middle
East necessitates the establishment of a Palestinian independent
state and the return of all Palestinian legitimate national and
political rights."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian authority threatened to declare an independent
state on May 4, but postponed the decision on the statehood until
after the May 17 Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
Barak has said in an interview with the Israeli television
Channel One that from the practical point of view, there is
already an existing Palestinian nation and his goal is to prevent
that state from threatening Israel.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Ministry Calls for Lifting of Ban on Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Deputy Minister of Culture
and Islamic Guidance in Charge of Press Affairs Shaban Shahidi
Moaddab Saturday called for lifting of the ban on the leading
moderate daily Salam (Hello).
</P>
<P>
"The Salam newspaper is expected to resume its activity soon,"
Shahidi said at a press conference, adding that the ministry is
doing its best to lift the ban on Salam and hopes its attempts
would bear fruits.
</P>
<P>
He appreciated the Intelligence Minister Ali Yunesi for
dropping the ministry's complaint against Salam on Thursday "to
prevent unnecessary tension in the political atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
The dropping came one day after the Iranian special court for
clergymen ordered the closure of the daily.
</P>
<P>
Shahidi said that following the Intelligence Ministry's
withdrawal of complaint against Salam, people and the media
community expect the daily to resume its activity soon.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced his ministry's opposition to the ruling by the
special court for clergymen, stressing that any press offense
should be dealt with in a press court and in the presence of a
jury.
</P>
<P>
Salam, a leading moderate daily supporting President Mohammad
Khatami, was accused of publishing "classified documents."
</P>
<P>
The daily claimed on Tuesday that former Deputy Intelligence
Minister Saeed Emami, a main mastermind behind serial political
killings of Iranian dissidents, had proposed amendment of the
press law in order to control the press.
</P>
<P>
The daily's closure triggered bloody clashes between Iranian
students and riot policemen on Thursday and Friday after some
university students staged a rally, protesting against the closure.
</P>
<P>
Violence occurred before Tehran University dormitory after
riot police forced into it without permission from the
Interior Ministry and beat up students there.
</P>
<P>
It was the most violent clash in the country since the Islamic
revolution in 1979. Eyewitnesses said that seven students were
killed, about 300 injured and 500 arrested.
</P>
<P>
Various Iranian authorities and parties strongly condemned the
move by the Iranian conservative-dominated police. Minister of
Culture and Higher Education Mostafa Moin resigned in a protest to
the bloody crackdown on students.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM to Visit Finland for Ties with EU, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
is scheduled to visit Finland next Thursday and Friday in a bid to
boost ties between Egypt and European countries, Assistant Foreign
Minister Fathi el Shazli said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Shazli, who is to accompany Moussa in the coming visit, told
reporters that the visit is "of special importance" as Finland is
holding the rotating presidency of the EU for the second half of
this year.
</P>
<P>
El Shazli said Moussa will hold talks with Finnish officials on
the Egyptian-EU relations, which he described as in an important
stage, referring to the finalization of the Egyptian-EU
partnership agreement.
</P>
<P>
After four years of negotiations, EU foreign ministers endorsed
last month the text of the agreement. But Egypt has yet to approve
the draft as what the country's chief negotiator Gamal Bayoumi
said there are around 15 clauses which remain to be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
The accord is aimed at providing for more open trade,
coordination in economic and financial areas, a political dialog
and joint efforts to combat money laundering and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
El Shazli said Moussa will also discuss with the Finnish
officials the Middle East peace process since moderate Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak has taken office.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty in 1979
with Israel and a key mediator in the Arab-Israeli peace talks. It
keeps close contacts with the EU, which desires to play a key role
in the peace process, in this regard.

Saturday after arriving in Abuja, Nigeria's capital.
</P>
<P>
"I have always said it is only when we Africans, with the

that we have on this continent that we can move forward and
concentrate on economic and social issues," he said.

Nigeria has "turned the corner" and set an example in the rule
of law and respect for human rights for other African countries,
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"I know the new government is determined to get its
macroeconomics policies right and move the country forward on
economic and social development."
</P>
<P>
He lauded the Sierra Leone Peace Accord signed on Wednesday and
the cease-fire deal on the civil war in the Democratic Republic of
Congo due to be signed this weekend, and reiterated UN's pledges
to help bolstering lasting peace for the two countries.
</P>
<P>

PALMA, Spain, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Cuba halved the four judo
titles at stake of the day, by taking all the women's top honors
at the Universiade here Saturday afternoon.

<P>
Gonzales Driulis triumphed first in the women's 57-kg category,
by beating Vernerova Michaela of the Czech Republic before her

<P>
Chinese He Ji, gold medalist in the 52-kg category in Fukuoka

</P>
<P>
"I still believed my ability to beat the Argentine in the third
round, but I didn't know why I couldn't do it," said He, who
finished runner-up in the national championship last April.
</P>
<P>
"He Ji lost the match because she settled for the close-body
tactics which deprived of her advantage of quick moves," explained
Chinese coach Fu Guoyi.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Security Council Urged to Be More Democratic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of the United
Nations, which has one member from the developing world in its
five permanent seats, should be restructured to be more
democratic, a senior U.N. official said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press briefing during the on-going session of the
Council of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),
Paolo Fulci, the incumbent President of U.N.'s Economic and Social
Council (ECOSOC) and Italian Ambassador to the U.N, said that the
Security Council should be " more democratic and give more
representation to the developing world."
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo crisis, which saw that the Security Council was
overlooked, is an example to show the need for a reform for the
Security Council, the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
He said one of the possibilities may be to increase the
permanent members from the current five to 10, with the added ones
sifted out through elections.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official said that at least two permanent rotating
seats should be given to Africa for more democratic
representation.
</P>
<P>
This, Fulci said, would wipe out the glaring inequity in
geographic distribution in the Security Council considering that
Africa is the continent with the largest number of U.N member
states.
</P>
<P>
The two seats for Africa should be endowed with veto power, and
that no categorizations should be introduced between
industrialized and developing countries, or between the North and
the South, so as to avoid additional discriminations within the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
As an alternative, he said, Italy is in favor of an increase,
for the time being, only in non-permanent seats.
</P>
<P>
In the exercise for Security Council reform, Italy has always
stressed the need for more transparency, democracy and equitable
representation in the council, he said, adding that his government
opposes any move that might privilege the few at the expense of
the many.

<HEADLINE> GCC Panel Ends Meeting Over UAE-Iranian Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) special committee charged with solving islands dispute
between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Iran concluded its
first meeting in the western Saudi city of Jeddah on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
No statement was issued following the meeting of the
tripartite panel, which is composed of Oman, Qatar and Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Foreign Minister Saud Al-Faisal, who attended the
session along with his Omani and Qatari counterparts as well as
GCC Secretary General Jamil Al-Hujailan, stopped short from
disclosing details of the discussions.
</P>
<P>
However, GCC sources close to the meeting told the Kuwait News
Agency that the ministers reviewed the view about setting up a
mechanism to settle the dispute between the UAE and Iran over the
Gulf islands of Abu Moussa, Greater and Lesser Tunbs.
</P>
<P>
The UAE claims sovereignty over the three islands which have
being controlled by Iran since 1971.
</P>
<P>
The GCC sources said the matter needs further discussions and
contacts before a certain agreement can be reached. But they
refused to go into details.
</P>
<P>
The ad hoc committee was formed during a GCC foreign
minister's meeting held in Jeddah last Saturday as a collective
effort to back the UAE stand on the islands dispute and to
encourage Iran to enter into direct talks on it.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic alliance
established in 1981, comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

</P>
<P>
Farmer, who had been fighting illness in recent years, died at a
hospital in Virginia, according to Ron Singleton, a spokesman for Mary

</P>
<P>
Farmer's most celebrated accomplishment was to lead the 1961
Freedom Rides, a nonviolent effort to desegregate interstate buses
and terminals.
</P>
<P>
"James Farmer helped to make America a better nation and I was
saddened to learn of his death today," President Clinton said in a
statement from California.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton last year presented Farmer with the
Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian award.
</P>
<P>
Farmer had taught at Mary Washington College since 1985, and
suffered pneumonia and blindness due to diabetes for the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
Farmer was born in Texas and grew up in Mississippi. He entered
Wiley College in Marshall, Texas, in 1934 as a 14-year-old

Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) Pawolu Falshi stressed here
today the importance of restructuring the U.N. Security Council to

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Calls for Lifting of Sanctions on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia on Saturday
called on the United Nations Security Council to lift sanctions
imposed on Libya in 1992 over the Lockerbie issue.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Press Agency monitored here quoted unnamed Saudi
officials as saying that the Security Council should take into
consideration Libya's cooperation with the U.N. to end the
Lockerbie crisis.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have long accused two Libyans of blowing
up a Pan Am flight in 1988 over Lockerbie, Scotland and demanded
Tripoli hand over the two suspects for trial.
</P>
<P>
After years of international mediation, especially from Saudi
Arabia and South Africa, Libya surrendered the two suspects on
April 5 this year for trial in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the U.N. suspended the sanctions and promised to
lift them 90 days after U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan verifies
that Libya has complied with all relevant requirements.

<HEADLINE> Signature on Congo (K) Peace Pact Put Off Due to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The heads of states of relevant
countries have postponed their signature on the Congo (K) peace
agreement due to the differences between the two factions of the
Congolese rebels, government sources here told Xinhua Saturday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The draft accord , hammered out in two week of tough talks here
by foreign or defense ministers of relevant countries, was agreed
on Thursday to be signed by their presidents here Saturday. But at
the last minute, snags cropped up as to which faction of the rebel
Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) will sign the document on
behalf of the rebels -- Wamba Dia Wamba's faction or Bizima
Kahara's.
</P>
<P>
Each of the two factions claims to represent the main groups
fighting the Laurent Kabila government in eastern Congo backed by
Rwanda after they split earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The draft pact said the U. N. security council, in
collaboration with the Organization of African Unity, would be
asked to create and deploy a peace-keeping force.
</P>
<P>
It also calls for national dialog between Congolese political
groups, creation of a new national army, release of prisoners of
war and humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
It agreed to address the security concerns of Rwanda and Uganda
and pledged to locate, identify and disarm exiled Rwanda Hutu
militia and exiled Ugandan armed factions.
</P>
<P>
Presidents of Zimbabwe, Rwanda, Uganda, Namibia and Congo (K)
and the Defense Minister of Angola have arrived here in order to
sign on the peace accord on the Democratic Republic of Congo to
end the civil war in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
Zambian President F. Chiluba has all along sponsored the
negotiations of the accord.

<HEADLINE> DRC Peace Accord Stalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 10 (Xinhua) -- African heads of state were
still locked behind closed doors in Lusaka, Zambia, on Saturday
night, in an attempt to rescue a peace pact between the warring
parties in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Support staff were packing up and members of cultural groups
who were to entertain delegates were also leaving, South African
Press Association quoted South African officials at the conference
center in Lusaka as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, delegates, including cabinet ministers from several
Southern African states, were still waiting for the outcome of the
closed-door meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We are all bored. We've had no word. The heads of state are
still in a meeting," one official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
South African President Thabo Mbeki was attending the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The official was unable to say whether the peace pact would be
ratified by the warring parties on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The official said all the parties to the conflict were present
and none appeared to have left.
</P>
<P>
The hitch appears to be a disagreement involving the Congolese
Rally for Democracy, whose leader Emile Ilunga is refusing to sign
the deal if an ousted faction leader, Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, also
signs, reports said.
</P>
<P>
A leader from the second rebel group, the Congo Liberation
Movement, was insisting that both factions should sign.
</P>
<P>
The issue of rebel signatures was left for heads of state to
resolve Saturday, after foreign and defense ministers were unable
to resolve the problem Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire plan, worked out by the foreign and defense
ministers, calls for a cease-fire within 24 hours and calls for a
joint military commission to administer the accord and oversee a
standstill of all fighters.
</P>
<P>
It also allows for the creation of a unified army after a
90-day national dialogue under a "neutral facilitator" on DRC's
political future; and peace keepers from the Organization of
African Unity or the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> Stability, Peace Precondition for Development: OAU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim said
Saturday that stability and peace is the precondition for Africa's
social development and economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out in his report to the 70th ordinary session of
the organization's Council of Ministers here that ethnic
upheavals, civil wars and multilateral conflicts are still
plaguing the continent's development and threatens to hinder it
further in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
African leaders are unprecedentedly unanimous in their views
that unless proper measures are taken, the continent would surely
be left behind further and its survival is likely to be in danger.
</P>
<P>
At present, war and conflict still exist in one third of
sub-Saharan countries. The wars result in millions of refugees and
heavy loss of properties, infrastructure and innocent lives.
</P>
<P>
Salim noted that the OAU and many African leaders have made
continuous efforts to prevent the spilling and deterioration of
these wars, but with little success. Now, the ethnic hatred in
many African countries deepens the eruption of renewed conflicts.
The border war between Ethiopia and Eritrea began to flare up
after a short repose.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the continued deterioration of the situation
between the two Horn of African neighbors could cause negative
implications for the region and beyond.
</P>
<P>
The Congo (K) civil war sucked in six countries soon after its
eruption in early August of 1998. The two sides sent a total of
more than 100,000 troops into the abyss of war, casting a shadow
over the fragile peace process of the third largest African
country.
</P>
<P>
What is more, the continent has witnessed the resurgence of the
 phenomenon of coup d'etat. Since the last sessions of Council and
Summit, coups have been perpetrated by the military in several
countries including Guinea Bissau, Niger and the Comoros. These
developments constitute a very disturbing trend and definitely a
severe setback to the ongoing process of democratization in the
continent.
</P>
<P>
Salim said in the report that these are brutal violations of
human rights and the basic principles of the United Nations and
the OAU and he called for immediate reversing of this trend.
</P>
<P>
Long years of war have destructed the poor infrastructure and
led to economic recession in these countries. Instability and
poverty form a vicious circle and engenders each other.
</P>
<P>
However, there is something encouraging. African leaders are
unprecedentedly aware of the daunting challenges and have spared
no effort to get rid of this insecurity.
</P>
<P>
Salim confessed that the instability is the most disturbing
thing for the continent. Social will not progress and economy will
not grow without peace and stability. To create a stable society
for development is the most pressing task every African leader
faces because it concerns the continent' s very survival in the
coming millennium.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Concerned About AIDS in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan minister of health Crispus
Kiyonga Saturday expressed concern about the negative effect of
HIV/AIDS on young people in Africa and Uganda in particular
leading to over 1.7 million people getting infected with the virus
in the country every year.
</P>
<P>
The minister who was opening a secondary school's HIV/AIDS
seminar here challenged the young people at the youth club at
Mary's College Kisubi.
</P>
<P>
Kiyonga revealed that 7,000 young people aged from 10 to 24 get
infected with HIV/AIDS every day which means that five youngsters
get infected every minute.
</P>
<P>
He said out of the three million children and young people
infected with HIV/AIDS in 1998 in Uganda, 590,000 were children
under 15 years while 2.5 million were between 15 and 24.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Uganda made some gains in this respect since
its response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic has been collective efforts
made by the government, NGOs, religious groups, individuals and
international donors.

<HEADLINE> Annan Discusses Nigeria's Role in S. Leone, U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, July 10 (Xinhua) - Visiting United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan discussed a wide range of topics with
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo Saturday in Abuja including
Nigeria's role in the U.N.
</P>
<P>
"We've had a very frank discussion, going over developments
since the new government took office and reviewing the situation
in the subcontinent and on the continent of Africa," said Annan at
a press conference after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed Sierra Leone and the ECOMOG troops, and the
heroic work they have done, and we talked about the Democratic
Republic of the Congo," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Many world politicians including him had earlier expressed
concerns over Nigeria's possible withdrawal from the force, which
had reinstated Sierra Leone's elected President Tejan Kabbah and
kept him in the presidency since March last year.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leone rebels the Revolutionary United Front has a
predominating military advantage over Kabbah's neglected
government troops.
</P>
<P>
But Nigeria has already said it would begin a phased withdrawal
of its troops from ECOMOG following the signing of a Sierra Leone
peace accord on Wednesday night in Togo's capital Lome.
</P>
<P>
Also discussed was the permanent seat issue on the United
Nations Security Council. Nigeria has been trying to thrust into
the top club of the world organization by claiming it has the
Africa's largest population.
</P>
<P>
But Annan termed the question as "thorny" since on our own
continent, Nigeria, Egypt and South Africa become contenders and
"this is a very thorny issue," Annan told the Press conference.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the question of debt relief for Nigeria had also
been raised. While this was more likely, now that reforms were
taking place, he said he could make no promises.
</P>
<P>
Annan has expressed optimism over the African continent and
Nigeria's reform process before his meeting with Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
"I have always said it is only when we Africans, with the
support of the international community, can settle the conflicts
that we have on this continent that we can move forward and
concentrate on economic and social issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has "turned the corner and set an example in the rule
of law and respect for human rights for other African countries",
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"I know the new government is determined to get its
macroeconomics policies right and move the country forward on
economic and social development."
</P>
<P>
He lauded the Sierra Leone Peace Accord signed on Wednesday and
the cease-fire deal on the civil war in the Democratic Republic of
Congo due to be signed this weekend, and reiterated UN's pledges
to help bolster the lasting peace for the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Annan landed in Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, on the
last leg of his west African tour that has also taken him to
Sierra Leone and Liberia. Annan and Obasanjo leave Nigeria for a
summit of the Organization of African Unity in Algiers on Sunday.

<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Chunyun, vice-chairman of
the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress, has
asked Party committees and governments at all levels to place
greater importance on implementing the Law on the Organization of
Villagers Committees to expand democracy and protect villagers'
rights.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 villagers committee law has been accepted by China's
800 million farmers, but only 60 percent of its villages have
instituted the democratic management and transparency mechanism as
was comprehensively defined by the law, Jiang said today.
</P>
<P>
Many places are still in the process of formulating rules on
implementing the law, according to Civil Affairs Ministry
officials, and Jiang said, in enforcing this law, the relations
between the self-governing villagers committees and local Party
committees and governments need to be properly handled.
</P>
<P>
Township governments should respect the self-governing status
of villagers committees but those committees should also
conscientiously accept the leadership of local Party committees,
he said.

EREZ CROSSING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser
Arafat promised Sunday to work together to overcome obstacles in
the peace process in order to start "a new dawn of peace and
security."
</P>
<P>
The two leaders described their 80-minute meeting at the
border junction between Israel and the Palestinian-ruled Gaza
as "constructive and fruitful."
</P>
<P>
"Our primary objective is to resume the mutual trust which is
so crucial to any possibility of security agreement," Barak told
a news conference after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides have suffered enough, it's about time to find a
way to mutual respect, a kind of partnership and make peace
together," he said.
</P>
<P>
He promised that his government will abide by all
international agreements signed by former Israeli government,
including the U.S.-brokered Wye deal.
</P>
<P>
He said he would continue to consult with the Palestinians
over the way of implementing the Wye, adding that he hoped to
combine it with the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Calling Barak a "friend and partner," Arafat said he is
confident that "together we can give peace process seriously and
truly a chance it deserves."
</P>
<P>
He urged Israel to carry out the Wye agreement in full and
halt Jewish settlements, calling them "illegal and destructive."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader also promised to fulfill Palestinian
obligations set by signed agreements, including fighting
terrorism.

BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese artists this evening
celebrated the 50th anniversary of the China Federation of
Literary and Art Circles in the China Theater.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Boost Revenue Yield in 3 Years: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Finance Minister Mahesh
Acharya told parliament Sunday that he had envisaged a plan to
accelerate the revenue yield within three years by a comprehensive
reform in tax regime.
</P>
<P>
Presenting to the parliament the draft budget for the 1999/2000
fiscal year starting mid-July, Mahesh said that while preparing
the tax proposals for the new fiscal year, he had adopted a
strategy for a stable and flexible tax structure with the
full-fledged implementation of the value-added tax (VAT).
</P>
<P>
The income tax and customs administrations will play a mutually
supportive role, he said.
</P>
<P>
He envisaged a revenue of some 44.5 billion rupees (654 million
U.S. dollars), or 58 percent of the total budget, in the new
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Though VAT was enforced in Nepal in 1997, it has been opposed
by the business community and is still not fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
Donors have been asking the Nepali government to boost revenue
collection by reforming the tax system. They said that Nepal is
becoming growingly dependent on foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has been in deficit budget for years with 24.1 billion
rupees, or 31 percent of the total budget, for the coming fiscal
year.

<HEADLINE> Spokesman on Lee Teng-Hui's Separatist Malice (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee's Taiwan Work Office and the
State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office said today that recent deeds
of Taiwan's Lee Teng-hui have exposed his true self and his real "
separatist malice".
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Taiwan, Lee said on July 9 that cross-
straits relations should be "state-to-state" or at least "special
state-to-state relations".
</P>
<P>
This was echoed by other Taiwanese officials who said that
relations between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan have changed
from those between "two equal political entities" to those between
"two states", and cross-straits talks are "bilateral talks between
two states."
</P>
<P>
Lee's flagrant redefinition of cross-straits relations as "
state-to-state relations" exposed his political malice and
intention to split the Chinese territorial integrity and
sovereignty and his attempt to separate Taiwan from China, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Lee's recent words were straight forward proof that his
repeated statements that he will not and has no need to pursue a
policy to seek Taiwan's independence and will never give up his
pursuit for unification of the country in the future were false,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Lee has been deceiving Taiwanese compatriots and misleading
people internationally, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Barak, Arafat Meet in Peace Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EREZ CROSSING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser
Arafat held a crucial meeting here Sunday in a bid to restart the
stalled Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
This was their first meeting since Barak took office as Israeli
prime minister last Tuesday. It was also the first
Israeli-Palestinian summit in seven months.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who arrived at the check point between Israel and the
Palestinian-ruled Gaza Strip at around 4 p.m. local time (13:00
GMT), greeted Arafat when he arrived a few minutes later.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders shook hands warmly and smiled for the cameras
before entering a white two-story building for talks.
</P>
<P>
The two are expected to exchange views on how to revive the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which were frozen in the last
three years due to the intransigence policy of Barak's predecessor
hard-liner Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said Barak would propose to Arafat that
Israel and the Palestinians bypass parts of the U.S.-brokered Wye
agreement and enter into the final status talks directly.
</P>
<P>
The Wye agreement, signed by Arafat and Netanyahu last October,
calls for Israel to withdraw from an additional 13 percent of the
West Bank in exchange for Palestinian measures on security.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu froze the implementation of the Wye accord after
carrying out the first phase of the three-stage pullout, citing
alleged Palestinian violations.
</P>
<P>
Beating Netanyahu by a landslide in the May elections on a
platform to revive the troubled peace process, Barak has pledged
to resume peace talks with the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon
with the same urgency.
</P>
<P>
While promising to abide by international agreements signed
by the former government, Barak said in a television interview
over the weekend that he would discuss with Arafat "whether we can
find a way to combine the implementation of the Wye agreement with
a final status agreement."
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper reports suggested that Barak might try to
persuade Arafat to give up on the Wye deal in exchange for Israeli
recognition of an independent Palestinian state, which Barak said
last week that already existed.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has repeatedly rejected the idea of bypassing the Wye
accord, urging Barak to carry it out in full.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders are also expected to discuss issues including
Jewish settlements and cooperation on combating terrorism.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in the
Egyptian port city of Alexandria Friday, the first of a series of
meetings with Arab leaders and U.S. President Bill Clinton, Barak
said he would not build new Jewish settlements but would not
dismantle existing ones.
</P>
<P>
The PNA sees the building of Jewish settlements as destructive
to the peace process and urged the Israeli government to halt all
settlement activities, including the expansion of existing ones.
</P>
<P>
Barak will travel to Jordan Tuesday for talks with Jordan's
King Abdullah before leaving for Washington Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Assassination Attempts Intensified in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The spokesman of the Somali
Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA), Mohamed Ali Aden Qalinleh, has
been attacked in an assassination attempt in his house in Karas
district of North Mogadishu Saturday nigh, as assassination
operations are intensified in Mogadishu, the capital of the horn
of Africa country.
</P>
<P>
Unidentified Somali gunmen have attacked the residence of
Qalinleh with hand grenades and assault rifles. At the time of
the attack, Qalinleh, his wife and 12 other people including his
children and relatives were at home.
</P>
<P>
Qalinleh who spoke with the reporters in his office in North
Mogadishu Sunday said no one was hurt in the attack, however he
did not know if any of the perpetrators of the attack was killed
or wounded.
</P>
<P>
His neighbors said about 10 gunmen have first thrown hand
grenades over the wall of the house then started firing at every
corner of the building. The bodyguards of the RRA spokesman have
returned fire as militiamen supporting Muse Sudi Yalahaw, a
militia leader opposing Ali Mahdi Mohamed, have also rushed to
the scene to defend the residence of the spokesman. Likewise
voluntary gunmen in the neighborhood had come out for help and
forced the perpetrators to flee.
</P>
<P>
Qalinleh said he suspects what he called the coalition forces
of Hussein Mohamed Aidid and Oromo-Ethnic Ethiopians supported by
Eritrea have carried out the attack. Qalinleh said his faction
would respond within 24 hours in retaliation to what had happened.
</P>
<P>
He had characterized the attack as cowardice and stupid. The
two warring countries of Ethiopia and Eritrea are each supporting
factions in Somalia as part of their efforts in undermining the
others powers in the region.
</P>
<P>
No one has so far claimed responsibility, nor is it known what
had prompted it. The RRA had recently been advancing towards
the only tarmac airport of Ballidogleh, 90 Km South of Mogadishu,
after taking control of Baidoa town with the help of Ethiopian
troops using strong military hardware. The forces of Aidid have
been seriously defeated in the battle for control of Baidoa 35
days ago.
</P>
<P>
"The objectives of the RRA can't be hampered by the killing of
only one man, and the struggle will continue as planned," said
Qalinleh adding that he is ready to sacrifice his life for his
people.
</P>
<P>
Qalinleh added his forces did not even kill one prisoner of
war they had captured from Hussein Aidid's side, but that Aidid's
militiamen had massacred innocent civilians and burned villages
during their stay in Bay and Bakol regions.
</P>
<P>
It was only three days ago when a senior official from the
Islamic fundamentalist group of Al-ITIHAD Al-Islam has been
killed in South Mogadishu. The deceased, Colonel Abdilahi Irad,
has been the head of the operations of Al-Itihad in Zone Five of
Ethiopia for the past seven years fighting against the government
of Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The Al-Itihad leader was killed by suspected Ethiopian
manipulated militiamen riding a taxi before a mosque in South
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
These assassination operations are frightening all active
politicians especially when both Eritrean and Ethiopian
manipulated armed elements are freely moving around in the
chaotic Somali capital. There has no been a central authority in
Mogadishu for more than eight years.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese shuttlers bagged all five
titles in the World Grand Prix Thailand Open Badminton
Championships, which ended here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Top seeded Dai Yun of China beat compatriot Gong Ruina in the

</P>
<P>
As for men's singles, Chen Gang outshone compatriot Ji Xinpeng

<HEADLINE> Lee Teng-hui's Remarks of Splitting Motherland Refuted in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Scholars from China's mainland,
Hong Kong and Taiwan here Sunday refuted Lee Teng-hui's remarks
that the relations across the Taiwan Strait are "special state-to-
state relations".
</P>
<P>
The scholars attending a seminar on China's peaceful
reunification in Hong Kong said that the remarks are intended to
split the motherland and run counter to the aspiration of a united
and prosperous motherland expressed by sons and daughters of the
Chinese nation around the world.
</P>
<P>
The remarks would do great harm to the relations between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait, they said.
</P>
<P>
Lai Yu-chi, a former legislator in Taiwan, said that Lee's
remarks of undisguised Taiwan Independence are obviously intended
to provoke conflicts between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Lai, an advocate of unification of the motherland, said that he
has organized dozens of seminars about the idea of "one country,
two systems" in Taiwan and there were a large number of people to
participate in these seminars.
</P>
<P>
As long as people understand the true meaning of the "one
country, two systems" concept, not the distorted propaganda, they
said they can accept the concept, Lai said.
</P>
<P>
Leung Wing On, president of the Taiwan Research Council (Hong
Kong), said that according to Lee's remarks, negotiators between
the two sides of the strait would not talk about peaceful
unification but about "establishing diplomatic relations between
two nations". Leung reminded people to think deeply about the
intention behind Lee's remarks.
</P>
<P>
Li Jiaquan, researcher of the Taiwan Institute of the Chinese
Society of Social Sciences, said that Lee's remarks indicated that
he has made up his mind to split Taiwan from the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Li said that Lee made these remarks before the visit to Taiwan
by Wang Daohan, president of the Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Strait. The remarks would not only do harm to the
relations across the strait but also have adverse impact on the
atmosphere of the negotiations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Cao Jianming, president of Eastern China Institute of Political
Science and Law and director of the Taiwan Institute of Shanghai,
said that Lee's remarks indicated that he is a diehard and public
advocator of Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
Chang Lin-chen, professor of Politics Department of Taiwan
University, said that the remarks are open to question from the
legal point.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- A recent report from Beijing's "
Outlook" magazine says that China's export situation this year is
grave.
</P>
<P>
The increase of 4.2 percent in May this year was based on the
low figure of May last year, the weekly says, adding that in May
of 1998 there was a decline of one billion U.S. dollars in exports,
the first ever.
</P>
<P>
Customs office statistics show Chinese exports were valued at
15.53 billion U.S. dollars in May this year. Exports to Hong Kong
were down sharply, as were exports from the southern province of
Guangdong, the biggest exporter in China.
</P>
<P>
To reach last year's export level, China has to sell 16.6
billion U.S. dollars worth of goods each month in the June-
December period, or 500 million U.S. dollars more every month than
the same period last year, the weekly says.

<P>
A report carried by Egypt's Middle East News Agency said a taxi

TIANJIN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- A joint venture of the United
States' Phillips Oil Company and China Offshore Oil Share-Holding

<HEADLINE> Barak Holds Key Talks with Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EREZ CROSSING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak began a crucial meeting with Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat here Sunday in a bid to restart the
stalled Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
This was their first meeting since Barak took office as prime
minister last Tuesday. It was also the first Israeli-Palestinian
summit in seven months.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders shook hands warmly and smiled for the cameras
before entering a white two-story building for talks near the
check point between Israel and the Palestinian-ruled Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to exchange views on how to revive the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which were frozen in the last
three years due to the intransigence policy of Barak's predecessor
hard-liner Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Israeli newspapers said Barak would propose to Arafat that
Israel combine the implementation of the U.S.-brokered Wye
agreement with a final status agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Wye agreement, signed by Arafat and Netanyahu last
October, calls for Israeli withdrawal from additional 13 percent
of the West Bank in exchange for Palestinian measures on security.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu froze the implementation of the agreement after
carrying out the first phase of the three-stage withdrawal, citing
alleged Palestinian violations.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has repeated that they will not accept the idea of
bypassing the Wye accord, urging Barak to carry it out in full.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders are also expected to discuss issues including
Jewish settlements and cooperation on combating terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Barak began a round of meetings with Arab leaders Friday by
holding talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in the
Egyptian port city of Alexandria. He will also meet with Jordan's
King Abdullah Tuesday before leaving for Washington Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Indo-Pak DGMOs Hold Meeting Along Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Directors general of
military operations (DGMOs) of India and Pakistan Sunday held a
meeting, the first one since India launched a big military
operation in Kargil sector of Kashmir from May 8 at Attari near
the international border to find a way out from the current
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said that the meeting was convened at the
request of the Pakistan government. The outcome of the meeting is
yet to be known as it is still in progress.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has been reported to have decided to immediately
restore the high level contacts with India and the offer in this
regard has been sent to New Delhi by its High Commissioner Ashraf
Jehangir Qazi.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the reports from Islamabad about a fresh
proposal by Pakistan for high-level talks, an External Affairs
Ministry spokesman R. S. Jassal said here Sunday that he was not
aware of it. He asserted that certain steps would have to be taken
before New Delhi could consider putting the composite dialogue
process with Islamabad back on track.
</P>
<P>
These steps were the eviction of intruders from the Indian
side, restoration of sanctity of the Line of Control (LOC)and
reaffirmation by Pakistan of the inviolability of the LOC, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if there was any move for a cease-fire in Kargil, the
spokesman said that "Until the last intruder is evicted, our
military operations will continue."

<HEADLINE> DRC Rebels Vow to Fight On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We have shown our good faith in the accord, but we will
continue to fight until they (all parties) come to realize that
nothing can be achieved without our participation,'' he told the
news agency in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
Nyarugabo said that his movement did not sign because of the
manipulation which led to RCD ousted rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia
Wamba "sneaking into the conference hall, claiming that he is the
legitimate head of the movement. "
</P>
<P>
''In our understanding, the agreement was supposed to be signed
by parties which negotiated it. The way Wamba, who only
participated as a mere observer, was invited to the signing
ceremonies leaves many questions unanswered about the role of the
mediator,'' Nyarugabo said.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Wamba and his attendance to the talks had been
debated three times between the RCD delegation and the mediator,
Zambian president Frederic Chiluba. The RCD rebel officials claim
they have agreed that Wamba would not sign, and would occupy the
back seat during the talks.
</P>
<P>
''Wamba does not represent anything, Wamba has no territory
under his control, he has no troops,'' Nyarugabo told RNA. ''If
they want to make peace with Wamba, let them do so!''
</P>
<P>
According to the RCD rebel leader, this manipulation at the
last minute of the signing ceremonies is to blame on president
Laurent Desire Kabila and his ally Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe who
want to use Wamba as a pretext to make the agreement void.
</P>
<P>
"We are not against Wamba, he can sign on his own account, not
on behalf of the RCD,'' Nyarugabo insisted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the mediator could pursue his efforts to have the
cease- fire signed by all concerned parties, but the RCD would
never accept to have ousted Wamba sign on its behalf.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Vice-premier Wen Jiabao, who is in
charge of flood control in China, has said that the fight against
possible floods in the Taihu Lake basin involving Jiangsu and
Zhejiang provinces and the city of Shanghai has been effective but
needs to be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Wen made the remark during a visit to the Taihu areas Friday to
Saturday, where he visited the dyke around the 2,200-sq.km. lake,
a main sluice gate, and some major water conservation facilities.
</P>
<P>
Water levels in Lake Taihu were 0.29 meters higher than the
record on July 7, after the Taihu area was hit by torrential rains
since late last month and rainfalls of nearly three times the
normal amount of rain.
</P>
<P>
Wen told officials from Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai to be
sure of the overall safety of local people, dykes, major cities,
and trunk road.
</P>
<P>
He said that dykes around the lake and cities need to be
further reinforced and that water needs to be drained into flood-
relief channels and sluice gates that were built after the
devastating floods in 1991 and have been useful in combating
floods this year.

KATHMANDU, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's economic growth could
not be satisfactory in the 1998/99 fiscal year though the gross
domestic product was estimated to grow by 3.4 percent, up 0.7
percentage points over the previous year, the Finance Ministry
said in an economic survey.
</P>
<P>
In the 1998/99 fiscal year which will end mid-July, the
agriculture sector and the non-agriculture sector are expected to

1997 to 2.5 percent in 1998 while the growth rate for the Asian
developing countries dropped from 6.6 percent in 1997 to 3.3
percent in 1998, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Other positive aspects for 1998/99 included high rate of export
growth, large surplus in balance of payments situation and surplus
in both current account and foreign exchange, the survey noted.
</P>
<P>
Some decline in the rate of interest and growth in the
transaction of bonds were other positive indices of the year, it
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the rate of inflation had reached to double digit as a
result of unexpected rise in food prices in the early part of the
year.
</P>
<P>
The flow of bank credit to the private sector remained slow and
slackness came in the pace of privatization, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
"The lack of expected improvement in revenue mobilization, high
growth rate of regular expenditure as compared to development
expenditure and unexpected increase in overdraft due to larger
expansion of expenditure in relation to resource mobilization have
been disappointing indices of public finance," the survey noted.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Young-Aged Population Reaches Over 9 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's young-aged population
between 15 and 24 is estimated to have reached over 9 million,
accounting for 18.75 percent of the total of over 48 million
people registered now, according to an official forecast released
here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
People of the age of 60 and above account for over 3.8 million
or 7.9 percent, it said.
</P>
<P>
The population of Myanmar is growing at about 2 percent or
about 800,000 people annually.
</P>
<P>
"With this population growth rate, Myanmar's population will
exceed 67.9 million by the year 2020," it estimated.
</P>
<P>
In general, Myanmar has a fair ratio between the nation's
present population and its area if facts such as the nation's
area, population density and population separation are studied,
it stated.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has a total land area of 677,000 square-kilometers
(sq-km) and its population density is at 70 persons per sq-km.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's life expectancy is rising and infant mortality and
mortality rate of children under one year and the entire nation's
mortality rate are decreasing as a result of the effective
implementation of the public health programs, healthcare plans and
birth spacing projects, it pointed out, adding that the country's
population is thus growing steadily year after year.
</P>
<P>
The country's population grew from only 16 million in 1941 to
35.3 million in 1983 when the latest census was taken, indicating
that the population has doubled in 42 years.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, being a U.N. member, observed Sunday the World
Population Day 1999, the 10th observance of such day since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Population Fund designated July 11, 1988, as the World
Population Day when the earth's population then reached 5 billion,
and it has also announced that the global population will reach 6
billion on October 12, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Seminar Calls For China's Peaceful Reunification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Some 200 Chinese scholars and
noted figures attending a seminar on China's peaceful
reunification Sunday reiterated the call for a peaceful resolution
of the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
China's sovereignty and territorial integrity is inseparable,
and the mainland and Taiwan both belong to Chinese territory
instead of the state-to-state relations, according to a joint
statement issued at the seminar that closed Sunday in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The statement calls for adherence to the "one China" stance,
and opposes concepts of "one China, one Taiwan" or "two Chinas."
</P>
<P>
It also asks both sides across the Taiwan Strait to hold
political negotiations as soon as possible to end the state of
hostility under the "one China" principle.
</P>
<P>
Because of special historical elements, Taiwan people's rights
and desire to be masters of their own destiny should be respected,
the statement says, adding that a special arrangement acceptable
to both sides must be found out for Taiwan's political status
under the "one China" principle.
</P>
<P>
The statement also expresses the hope for increased economic
exchanges and cooperation, and the opposition to hindering normal
economic and trade cooperation and exchanges across the Taiwan
Strait by political and man-made obstacles.
</P>
<P>
It urges Taiwan to open the direct postal, commercial and
transport links at an early date, and give up their obsolete
policy of restraining Taiwanese investment on the mainland, in
order to improve the competitiveness of Taiwan business people on
the mainland.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, it says, the mainland should better protect
rights and interests of Taiwan investors, simplify procedures and
improve systems to woo more Taiwan investment.
</P>
<P>
In terms of academic and cultural exchanges, the statement says
the two sides on the Taiwan Strait should jointly promote Chinese
culture, as both sides share the same national ideology in the
same language.
</P>
<P>
Both sides should increase academic and cultural exchanges to
improve people's emotions and reduce the sense of hostility, the
statement says, noting that any excuse of "localization" and
policy to split China's education and culture must be opposed.

</P>
<P>
-- The heads of six central African nations agreed Saturday to

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Calls on Congolese to Choose </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
says people of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) should be
given an opportunity to choose their own leaders through
democratic elections without anyone imposing themselves on them.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said this at a press conference here at State House
Sunday morning shortly before departure for the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) summit in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
He says the ceasefire agreement signed Saturday night in Lusaka
will end the conflict in Congo (K) and pave way for a democratic
process to start in the country.
</P>
<P>
The people of the DRC resent war and where fade up with leaders
trying to impose themselves on them without receiving the mandate
from the electorate, the president said.
</P>
<P>
He said the conflict between the rebels and President Laurent
Kabila's government should come to an end and challenged the
political leaders there to go back to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
The congolese people should decide who leads them in the
further, he added.
</P>
<P>
The President expressed optimism that war would not return to
the country adding that the belligerents had expressed political
will and determination to lay down their weapons to end the
11-month conflict.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the ceasefire document was tailored by the
rebels and governments involved in the conflict thereby making it
almost impossible for the resumption of conflict.
</P>
<P>
He said the warring factions totally agreed with all the
contents of the ceasefire agreement which spells out among other
things the security concerns of the concerned states and
modalities of its implementation.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said the joint military commission (JMC) would be
formed at an appropriate time that would ensure the smooth
withdraw of all foreign troops and facilitate internal dialog to
facilitate democratization.
</P>
<P>
He said despite that the rebels who included the Rally for
Congolese Democracy (RCD) and the movement for the Liberation of
Congo (MLC) had not signed the document, the ceasefire was binding
and would certainly bring peace to the country.
</P>
<P>
The rebels would sign the document after sorting out their
internal leadership issues, Chiluba said.

<HEADLINE> Political Disparity Should Not Hinder Cross-Strait Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 11 (Xinhua) -- A seminar on China's peaceful
reunification was told on Sunday that economic cooperation across
the Taiwan Straits should not be affected or hindered by the
political disparity.
</P>
<P>
Wang Hui, an executive member of the Economic and Trade
Coordination Committee between the Two Sides Across the Taiwan
Straits, reiterating the above principle, also said that both
sides of the Taiwan Straits should adopt practical and vigorous
measures to boost such cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Wang told the on-going seminar in Hong Kong that the economic
and trade exchanges between the two sides across the Taiwan
Straits have been thriving in the past two decades through the
surmounting of political barriers one after another.
</P>
<P>
By May 1999, the volume of indirect trade, which was resumed in
1979, amounted to 145.544 billion U.S. dollars, with an annual
growth rate of 34.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the number of the Taiwan-invested projects
reached 42,381, with a total contractual investment of 42.32
billion U.S. dollars and an actual investment of 22.36 billion U.S.
dollars. Taiwan now is the fourth largest investor on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Wang said both sides of the Taiwan Straits are complementary
with each other in their economic development.
</P>
<P>
In developing agriculture, for instance, he said, Taiwan has
its advantages in terms of fund and technology, while the mainland
has vast land, abundant resources and a manpower surplus.
</P>
<P>
By increasing cooperation and coordinating their roles, the two
sides could complement their advantages and achieve common
prosperity, he said.
</P>
<P>
Faced with the trend of economic globalization, Wang said, it
is an inevitable choice for both sides to set aside the political
disparity in the interest of their economic development.
</P>
<P>
This principle also provides guidance to the resolution of the
issues of direct postal, commercial and transport links across the
Taiwan Straits, he said, adding that many measures have proven to
be effective in practicing the principle.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the steadfast reform and opening up on the mainland
will offer ample opportunities for the economic cooperation and
exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
For five years in a row between 1993 and 1997, the mainland was
one of top countries in terms of drawing foreign investment, next
only to the United States, he said. Nearly 400 of the top 500
transnational corporations in the world have invested on the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
Wang also called for increased cooperation among the mainland,
Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao to achieve the synergy of the
economies and lay a solid foundation for the early realization of
the great cause of the reunification of the motherland.

<HEADLINE> Rummenigge Hopes Matthaeus Will Stay for End of Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Bayern Munich vice-president Karl-
Heinz Rummenigge said he hoped Lothar Matthaeus would stay with
the club until the end of the coming season, a newspaper reported
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Rummenigge told the Bild am Sonntag: "I wish Lothar would seize
the opportunity he has to stay until the end of the season."
</P>
<P>
"It would be good for him in his preparations for Euro 2000 and
that way we could offer him a nice farewell game in the summer to
crown his career end," Rummenigge added.
</P>
<P>
Matthaeus, 38, has with a Bavarian club a contract which runs
until June 2000.
</P>
<P>
The veteran libero was quoted last month as saying he was
planning to play with U.S. Major League club New York-New Jersey
MetroStars during the winter break.
</P>
<P>
But Bayern Munich managing director Uli Hoeness said he was
confident Matthaeus would finish the season before leaving.

<HEADLINE> Tehran University Chancellor Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chancellor of Tehran
University Mansour Khalili Iraqi on Sunday submitted his
resignation to Minister of Culture and Higher Education Mostafa
Moin in protest to the bloody crackdown on students by the police.
</P>
<P>
In his resignation, Iraqi accused the police of raiding the
university dormitory despite efforts made by the university
officials to prevent them from entering the Tehran University
campus.
</P>
<P>
The assault, which resulted in numerous casualties as well as
plunder of the university and students' properties, had no
justification, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) quoted him
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The conservative-controlled police on Thursday night launched
the unauthorized crackdown on students who staged a rally to
protest the new press law and the ban of the popular moderate
daily Salam (Hello).
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said seven students were killed, 300 injured and
500 arrested in the crackdown, which triggered a nationwide
condemnation.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, Moin submitted his resignation Saturday
to President Mohammad Khatami as a protest. But Khatami rejected
his resignation on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Condemning the crackdown, the reformist president expressed his
apology over the incident and promised to probe into the issue.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said hundreds of students on Sunday morning resumed their
protest demonstrations at the Tehran University dormitory after
temporally halting their sit-in early Sunday morning "to maintain
their physical and spiritual strength to keep up with their
resistance."
</P>
<P>
Students demanded the punishment of those responsible for the
crackdown, release of the arrested students, transfer of the
authority of commanding police to the moderates-dominated Interior
Ministry and dismissal of the hard-line police commander.
</P>
<P>
The students vowed to carry on with the resistance until their
demands were met.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tehran University presiding board and deans of its
different colleges announced to hold a sit-in Monday morning at
the university mosque to protest the crackdown.

<HEADLINE> Mine Closure Could Result in Ecological Disaster: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 11 (Xinhua) --The Mine Workers Union (MWU)on
Sunday warned that the closure of Gauteng's East Rand Proprietary
Mines (ERPM) could result in an ecological disaster.
</P>
<P>
The union Spokesman Fred Bond said that aside from the economic
 implications of closing the mine, an ecological catastrophe was
inevitable if the government decided to revoke its monthly 1.7
million rand (280,000 U. S. dollars) subsidy to the mine to purify
toxic water.
</P>
<P>
Bond said a subterranean dam is poisoned with pollutants of
steel and iron oxide from underground mining activities in
Gauteng.
</P>
<P>
Should this dam overflow at the lowest shaft of the mine, it
will flow into the Blesbok River.
</P>
<P>
"This will cause toxification of the drinking water of millions
of people in Gauteng," Bond said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The subsidy keeps a purification system in place before
entering the Blesbok river system, which lower down becomes part
of the Vaal River.
</P>
<P>
Bond said the underground water table rose in the early
nineties and polluted water drained into the Blesbok River.
</P>
<P>
The pollution destroyed natural bird, fish and plant life.
</P>
<P>
"Cattle died along the river, the local community, who were
dependent on the water, could not use it and farmers were faced
with a crisis," Bond said.
</P>
<P>
He said a committee called "Keep Blesbok Green" was recently
established to pressure liquidators and the government to address
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
ERPM went into provisional liquidation last week, partly due to
the drop in the gold price as a result of the sale of European
gold reserves.
</P>
<P>
Five thousand miners stand to lose their jobs if the mines are
closed.

<HEADLINE> Kashmiri Alliance Hints at Re-adjustment of Positions in Kargil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Jihad Council (UJC),
alliance of 15 Kashmiri groups fighting the Indian rule, Sunday
hinted that the Mujahideen (holy war fighters) could re-adjust
their positions in Kargil-Drass sector but categorically ruled out
any withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
"Withdrawal from our present positions is out of question, but
we can re-adjust our positions due to climatic condition and due
to enemy tactics," Chairman of UJC Syed Salahuddin Ahed was quoted
by the News Network International as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Hundreds of Indian artillery and dozens of fighter planes are
bombing Mujahideen positions and it would not be less than death
sentence if our fighters vacate their positions in such
situation," Salahuddin said.
</P>
<P>
"The Mujahideen can think about withdrawal if the international
community explicitly assure us that they will settle the
long-standing dispute according to the aspirations of Kashmiris,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Salahuddin condemned the stand held by the United States and
other western countries on Kashmir as "unrealistic, inhuman and
unjustified", and said they backed India, ignoring the killings of
seventy thousands people and the continued gang rape of the women
by the Indians.
</P>
<P>
He described Mujahideen's victories in Kargil-Drass sector as a
milestone in the history of 10-year of Kashmir armed struggle.
"Operation in Kargil is a message for Indians that we can beat and
dislocate them."
</P>
<P>
He said Mujahideen have cut off Indian troops' main supply
route in Kargil-Drass sector, endangering the lives of four
division of Indian troops in the Siachin glacier.
</P>
<P>
"It would be difficult for Indian troops in Siachin to survive
if the Mujahideen block their supply till September," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Developments in Kargil have invited the world attention that
there could be a big war if the Kashmir dispute was not resolved,"
Salahuddin claimed.
</P>
<P>
He, however, regretted that Washington and G-8 countries turned
blind eyes and deaf ears to the long-sufferings of Kashmiris.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question about the Sharif-Clinton agreement, the
UJC chairman said, "We respect Pakistan leadership but totally
reject the agreement between Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and
President Bill Clinton," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the people in India-held Kashmir hold Pakistani
leadership in high esteem but not at the cost of Jehad-e-Kashmir
(holy war of Kashmir).

<HEADLINE> Blair: No Northern Ireland Assembly Without Weapons Decommissioning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
has reassured Ulster Unionists that a Northern Ireland assembly is
not possible without weapons decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Sunday on BBC, Blair reiterated that Sinn Fein cannot
sit in the Northern Ireland Assembly if the Irish Republican Army
(IRA) does not get rid of its weapons.
</P>
<P>
Blair believed the IRA and Sinn Fein are linked, saying that
there is "no way they can continue in the executive" if they do
not decommission.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the peace process, Blair, who described himself as
an "eternal optimist", called on Northern Ireland's rival
politicians not to throw away the best chance for peace in a
generation.
</P>
<P>
"We will never have a better chance (of peace) this generation,
of that I have absolutely no doubt," said Blair.
</P>
<P>
"I think we have taken it as far as we possibly can, if we can'
t make progress now, these issues aren't going to change," he
added.
</P>
<P>
As a Thursday deadline approached for introduction of a power-
sharing Northern Ireland executive with parties involved still far
apart, Blair said negotiations in the next few days would be
crucial for the future of the British province.

<HEADLINE> "Family Hotline" Opens in Beijing's Jails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- When He Ruizhong, a prisoner in
Beijing, recently made a phone call from his jail to his family in
Tianjin, his sister was very surprised and could not believe her
ear, assuming that her brother had escaped from prison.
</P>
<P>
He spent a few minutes in explanations through the "family
hotline" before his sister understood what happened.
</P>
<P>
"It's the hotline that gave me a chance to chat with my sister
and her family," said the 60-year-old He who was sentenced to 13
years' imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, all prisons in Beijing had opened "family
hotline." And with the approval of the administrative offices of
the prisons, those qualified prisoners can make phone calls to
their families with IC card.
</P>
<P>
Wang Lingpeng, a 31-year-old prisoner in Beijing, also made a
phone call to his sister. "I heard my nephew's voice for the first
time," said Wang, who was sentenced to a ten-year term of
imprisonment on a charge of theft in 1992 before his nephew was
born.
</P>
<P>
"But not all prisoners are entitled to the right to make phone
calls," said an official of the Beijing Municipal Administration
of Prisons.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the administration has worked out rules
for the conditions and approval procedures for prisoners to make
phone calls in prison. He described this new measure as a way of
educating prisoners through joint efforts of the prison and
society.
</P>
<P>
"Those who get the approval can make one or two phone calls to
their family members each month, and each phone call is limited to
10 to 30 minutes," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the wall of the corridor in the Beijing Prison, there is a
table registering performance marks of the prisoners. "Those who
get high points will be given awards including going home to visit
their families at spring festivals, spending a day with their
families at specially arranged rooms in the prison, and making
phone calls," the prison official explained.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Zhenyi, deputy warden of Beijing Prison, said that it is
estimated that about 80 percent of the prisoners in Beijing Prison
will have right to make phone call through such "family hotline."
</P>
<P>
To let society know more about prison, the Beijing Municipal
Administration of Prisons early this month opened a special line
numbered "1600628."
</P>
<P>
By dialing this number, people can get information about
related laws, regulations and rules, and policies about the
imprisonment and prisons in Beijing, Zhao said, adding that they
can also learn about the conditions of the prisons in Beijing as
well as related conditions of the prisoners.

YUSHU, (Qinghai), July 11 (Xinhua) -- A 4,000-ha shelter belt
has been built in the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of
northwestern Qinghai Province over the past nine years despite the
cold climate, harsh natural conditions and an elevation of 4,000
meters.
</P>
<P>
This was part of the central government's effort to protect and
improve the ecological environment at the Yangtze River source.
</P>

The 6,300-km river, the longest in China, covers an area of 1.8
million sq km and meanders through 11 provinces, municipalities
and autonomous regions, including Qinghai, Sichuan and Yunnan
provinces, the Tibet Autonomous Region and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Over the past nine years, Yushu and Chindu counties, which are
included in the first phase of the project, have planted 1.38
million trees using 7.64 million yuan (925,000 U.S. dollars) and
taking 200,000 labor days.
</P>
<P>
Since the central government initiated the afforestation
project in 1990, forestry coverage rate in the two counties has
increased from past 10 percent to the present 80 percent.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Government Declares Poultry Dioxin Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has declared its poultry
industry free of dioxin contamination and lifted its ban on
operations of poultry farms which had imported fodder from Belgium
and other European countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Jordan TV Saturday evening, Prime Minister Abdel
Raouf Rawabdeh said the dioxin problem had never infected Jordan's
poultry.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after a meeting of the Food Council which
was chaired by Prince and the provisional Regent Faisal Bin
Hussein, younger brother of King Abdullah Bin Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Officials assured the regent, who is temporarily in charge of
government affairs as King Abdullah is now on a European tour, at
the meeting that the dioxin problem never existed in the country
and measures taken by the Health and Agriculture Ministries were
"merely precautionary."
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Ministry has lifted its month-long ban on the
operations of 91 poultry farms across the country which had
imported animal feeds from Belgium and other European countries.
</P>
<P>
The first cases of serious dioxin contamination were reported
in Belgium earlier this year, leading to panic across the
world's food industry and worldwide bans on the import of meat,
eggs, milk and fodder from Belgium and other European countries.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry in Amman had also called on the public to
check the origins of imported meat, eggs and food before
consumption.
</P>
<P>
Dioxin is a nocuous chemical substance which might cause
cancer and other serious health problems, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Saturday, Mohammad Obeidat, president of the Jordan
Consumer Protection Society, attempted to quell public fears of
dioxin contamination in the desert kingdom.
</P>
<P>
All tests and laboratory reports showed that there was no
dioxin problem in the country, he said on Jordan TV.

<HEADLINE> Refugee Issue to Top Agenda of Myanmar FM Visit to Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The "intricate issue" of
repatriating Rohingya refugees from Bangladesh is likely to top
the agenda of the coming visit by Myanmar's foreign minister to
Dhaka later this month.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are also expected to discuss other matters of
mutual interest during the scheduled three-day visit by Myanmar
Foreign Minister U Win Wung, who is slated to arrive here on July
17.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Foreign Office sources, the New Nation newspaper
reported on Sunday that Wung's visit was a "familiarization tour."
</P>
<P>
Wung will hold official talks with his Bangladeshi counterpart
Abdus Samad Azad, and their talks are likely to focus on the issue
of repatriation of some 21,000 Rohingya refugees, who are now
sheltered in Cox's Bazar district, southeastern Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The issue of land mining by the Myanmar side along the 80
km-long no-man's land bordering the two countries may also come
for discussion, the report said, adding that a total of 22
wood-cutters, fishermen and other people have fallen victim to
land mines in the area since 1993.
</P>
<P>
About 300 refugees have been repatriated to Myanmar since
November last year following an understanding reached between the
two countries. In accordance with the understanding, 50 refugees
should be repatriated each week.
</P>
<P>
About 250,000 Rohingyas from Myanmar crossed into Bangladesh in
early 1991, and in the past eight years, 230,000 refugees have
returned voluntarily. The repatriation of the refugees to Myanmar
came to a halt in July 1997 reportedly as a result of the
refugees' refusal to return.

<HEADLINE> Farmland Strapped Province Reclaims Waste Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province has
reclaimed 133,000 ha of waste land, 77,300 ha of which have been
turned into fertile land in the past ten years.
</P>
<P>
The coastal province, one of China's richest regions, has over
70 million people but only 4.47 million ha of farmland.
</P>
<P>
China decided in 1988 to reclaim waste land to turn into
farmland so as to feed its large population. By 2000, the country
plans to reclaim four million ha of wasteland, which includes
tidal flats.
</P>
<P>
China has 0.13 billion ha of farmland and the per capita
farmland is not yet even half of the world average.
</P>
<P>
The Jiangsu provincial government planned and carried out the
land reclamation project. It ordered all companies which have
taken up farmland for commercial and industrial purposes to create
the same area of farmland used. This in turn created the need for
professional land reclamation companies.
</P>
<P>
Companies building highways, reservoirs, factories and mines
are now customers of the land reclamation companies.
</P>
<P>
The newly-established Fangyuan Land Reclamation Company in
Changzhou City recently completed the feat of transforming 12 ha
of fertile farmland out of a waste ground scattered with bricks
and tiles.

<HEADLINE> ROUNDUP: Give and Take Lead to Congo Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The summit to sign the agreement was delayed for 12 hours
because of the disagreement over who should represent the rebel
Rally for a Democratic Congo (RDC) to sign the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The rebels split into two factions -- one led by Emile Ilunga
and the other led by Ernest Wamba Dia Wamba.
</P>
<P>
The group led by Ilunga was firmly opposed to Wamba's signing
of the agreement but Wamba insisted that the two factions sign the
agreement together.
</P>
<P>
No agreement on the issue was reached despite the over 10 hours
of the consultations by the heads of state of concerned countries
and the rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba said that all the rebel
factions have no objection to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
He said in order to continue the peace process all the rebel
groups including the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo
(MLC) led by jean- Pierre Bemba would not sign the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said that he would help them to resolve their dispute
after the 35th summit of the Organization for African Unity to be
held next week. The rebels agreed to the suggestion, he added
</P>
<P>
A quick end to the war will not only benefit the DRC but also
benefit the Great Lakes region and Africa as a whole, the
president said.
</P>
<P>
For ending the war, which broke out on August 2 last year,
bilateral talks and multilateral consultations have been held one
after another in African capitals including Lusaka, Harare,
Pretoria, Windhoek, Kinshasa, Dar es Salaam, Libreville, Kigali,
N'djamena and Kampala.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, who has been mandated by the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) to mediate a peaceful solution to the
war, and some other African leaders have been shuttling frequently
between various African capitals.
</P>
<P>
In the past some agreements were reached in some of the talks
but no breakthrough was made because none of the talks involved
all the stakeholders. Due to disagreement some of the talks were
boycotted by certain stakeholders while the others were not
accessible to the rebels. As a result no agreements were binding
on all the belligerents.
</P>
<P>
Today all the warring countries signed the agreement at the
Lusaka summit, which has been postponed repeatedly from the
original date of last December 8.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the agreement demonstrates Africa's ability to
resolve its own problems by itself. Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
At least five other African countries are involved in the
conflict in the vast mineral-rich central African country, making
the problem more complicated and sticking to deal with.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Up to now no one has won the war and a
realization by both sides that the war cannot be won pushed the
warring parties to seek a peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that Zimbabwe alone spends about one million
U.S. dollars every day on its troops backing DRC President Laurent
Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Kabila backed down in February from refusal to have dialogs
with the rebels, whom Kabila dismissed as puppets of Uganda and
Rwanda. He said he was open to dialog with all Congolese at home
or abroad, an apparent step forward in the peace process. In the
next month he agreed to allow the rebels to attend peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, who control over half of the DRC territory, attended
for the first time in the peace talks started in Lusaka on April
16.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, accusing Kabila of corruption and incompetence,
took arms on August 2, last year and at one stage were fighting
near the capital city of Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Kabila requested Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia to send troops to
his country to repel the rebels' attack when they began entering
Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean, Angolan and Namibian troops came first and then
Chadian troops in aid of Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda, which helped Kabila seized power from late
strongman Mobutu Seko Seko in May of 1997, bear resentment against
Kabila after he took office because he fails to prevent Former
Rwanese Armed Forces (EX-FAR) and Rwandans armed militias who were
involved in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, as well as Former Uganda
National Army from frequently attacking using the territory of DRC
as springboard against the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda both accused Kabila of harboring the rebels
against the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two neighboring countries with DRC have deployed
10,000-strong troops to guarantee their security and in support of
the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo (MLC) rebels fighting
to topple Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement all armed groups in the DRC will be tracked
down and disarmed, and the DRC government, the RDC and MLC as well
as the unarmed opposition shall enter into an open national dialog
which will lead to the reestablishment of state administration
and a new political dispensation to meet the demand of the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement all foreign forces will pull out of DRC and
all the belligerent forces will cease hostilities. The halt of
fighting by RDC and MLC and the withdrawal of Rwandan and Ugandan
forces are what Kabila wants.
</P>
<P>
Now the agreement has been signed but implementing it will be a
more uphill task.

<HEADLINE> Bus Strike Fizzles out in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The four-day country-wide strike
of the privately-run bus (known as matatu) in Kenya has fizzled
out Sunday when met with the government's intransigent stand over
newly-introduced public transport regulations.
</P>
<P>
The transport situation has been slowly returning to normal in
many parts of the east African country with many routes resuming
operation.
</P>
<P>
The matatu operators went on strike Wednesday, claiming the
Transport Licensing Board (TLB) regulations would put them out of
business.
</P>
<P>
The TLB regulations require bus owners to pay 1,799 to 2,800
shilling (about 25 to 39 U.S. dollars) every year for a road
license, covering advance taxes, insurance fees and Public Service
Vehicle stickers.
</P>
<P>
The strike once compelled a lot of commuters to walk to work
and some shops to close in fear of looting, but it had no impact
on foreign visitors since they usually take taxis.
</P>
<P>
Some members of parliament took advantage of the matatu strike,
calling a national strike.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi said Tuesday that the
government would not tolerate the demonstration in view of the
safety of passengers, citing that increased fees to be paid by
matatu owners enable to compensate victims of matatu accidents.
</P>
<P>
Numerous accidents were attributed to matatus, which are
infamous for their reckless driving and speeding, according to
local media reports.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Rejects Minister's Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
on Sunday rejected Higher Education Minister Mostafa Moin's
resignation filed in protest to the bloody crackdown of university
students by the police.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Moin, Khatami condemned the unauthorized raid on
students by the conservative-controlled police and expressed his
apology over the incident, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Praising Moin's efforts to pacify the enraged students, the
president promised that he would follow up the incident.
</P>
<P>
Moin submitted his resignation on Saturday after anti-riot
policemen forced into the Tehran University dormitory to crack
down students who were staging a rally to protest a new press law
aims to curb press freedom and the ban of the prominent reformist
daily Salam (Hello).
</P>
<P>
It was the most violent clash in the country since the 1979
Islamic revolution and the severest result yet of the power
struggle between the hard-line clerics who dominate the countries'
most powerful posts and the moderate reformists spearheaded by
President Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said that seven students were killed, 300 injured
and 500 arrested by the police.
</P>
<P>
Moin condemned in his resignation as utterly unacceptable the
entering of security forces into Tehran University campus and
their beating up of students.
</P>
<P>
"I consider this incident a suspicious measure with an aim to
turn the society into turmoil and to sabotage the trend of
political development and undermine the Islamic Republic system,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Tehran University Chancellor Khalili Iraqi on Saturday also
announced his resignation at a student rally to protest the
attack.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) headed by
President Khatami convened on Saturday and condemned the bloody
crackdown on university students by the police.
</P>
<P>
The SNSC promised that the official who ordered the crackdown
would be immediately dismissed and be brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said thousands of students on Sunday morning resumed their
protest demonstrations in the Tehran University housing compound
after temporally halting their sit-in early Sunday morning "to
maintain their physical and spiritual strength to keep up with
their resistance."
</P>
<P>
Students demanded the punishment of those responsible for the
assault, release of the arrested students, transference of the
authority of commanding police to the moderates-controlled
Interior Ministry and dismissal of the hard-line police commander.
</P>
<P>
The students vowed to carry on with the resistance until their
demands were met.

<HEADLINE> Hard-won Fruit of African Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Wang Nengbiao
</P>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to the unremitting efforts
of African countries, all the warring parties in the 11-month
conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) finally signed
a cease-fire agreement here on Saturday, thus paving the way for
peace in the third largest country on the continent.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited agreement and the delayed Lusaka summit for
the matter, originally scheduled on December 8, last year, give
hope for political stability and economic development in the Great
Lakes region and even the entire Africa.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which took effect right after it was signed,
demonstrates Africa's ability to resolve its own problems, a hard-
won fruit thanks to cessions by all conflicting parties in burying
their sharp differences.
</P>
<P>
Even at the eleventh-hour of the signing ceremony, disagreement
remained as to who will ink the pact on behalf of the rebel Rally
for a Democratic Congo (RDC), which led to a 12-hour delay in the
schedule.
</P>
<P>
The RDC split into two factions in May -- one led by Emile
Ilunga and the other by Ernest Wamba Dia Wamba. The Ilunga group
firmly opposed Wamba's signing of the agreement while Wamba said
both should sign it.
</P>
<P>
Seeing this, Zambian President Chiluba persuaded the rebel
groups, including the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo (
MLC) led by Jean-Pierre Bemba, to first refrain from signing the
pact until disagreement among them was removed, so as to keep the
peace process once started rolling.
</P>
<P>
The long way leading to the deal has witnessed a spate of
bilateral and multilateral consultations one after another in many
African capitals including Lusaka, Harare, Pretoria, Windhoek,
Kinshasa, Dar es Salaam, Libreville, Kigali, N'djamena and Kampala.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, who has been mandated by the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) to mediate a peaceful solution to the
war, and some other African leaders, have been having a very busy
time shuttling between African capitals.
</P>
<P>
As at least five other African countries were involved in the
conflict in the vast mineral-rich central African country, the
problem was really complicated and thorny to deal with.
</P>
<P>
The various talks and diplomatic efforts did bring about
agreements of one type or another. However, no breakthrough was
secured as none of them had managed to muster all the stakeholders
and were binding on all the belligerents.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the warring parties have come to realize that no one
could ever win and turned their eye instead for a peaceful
solution.
</P>
<P>
In February, Kabila backed down from refusal to have dialogues
with the rebels, whom he dismissed as puppets of Uganda and Rwanda,
and stated he was open to talks with all Congolese at home or
abroad, an apparent step forward in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In the following month, he agreed to allow the rebels to attend
peace talks. The rebels, who controlled over half of DRC, showed
up for the first time in the peace talks held in Lusaka on April
16.
</P>
<P>
The rebels accusing Kabila of corruption and incompetence took
arms on August 2 of last year and at one stage were fighting near
the capital city of Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Kabila asked Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia to send troops to his
country to repel the rebel attackers when they began entering
Kinshasa. Zimbabwean, Angolan and Namibian troops came first and
then Chadian troops, to help Kabila push back the rebels. It was
estimated that Zimbabwe alone spent about one million U.S. dollars
every day on its troops in DRC.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda, which helped Kabila seize power from Mobutu
Sese Seko in May 1997, grew sour with him after he failed to
prevent former Rwandese Armed Forces (EX-FAR) and Rwanese armed
militias who took part in the 1994 genocide of about one million
people in Rwanda, as well as former Uganda national army, from
frequently attacking them by using DRC as a spring-board.
</P>
<P>
The two neighboring countries even accused Kabila of harboring
the rebels and deployed 10,000-strong troops inside DRC to
guarantee their security. Kabila, on his part, accused the two of
backing the RDC and Movement for the Liberation of the Congo (MLC)
to topple him.
</P>
<P>
Now with the peace agreement, all armed groups in DRC will be
tracked down and disarmed, which is apparently what Uganda and
Rwanda want.
</P>
<P>
The agreement provides that the DRC government, the RDC and MLC
as well as the unarmed opposition, shall hold an open national
dialogue which will lead to the re-establishment of state
administration and a new sharing of political power among all
parties. This is exactly what the opposition armed or unarmed
wants.
</P>
<P>
This agreement has come with so great an effort, surely its
implementation is expected to be a more uphill task.

</P>
<P>
While Japanese exports to the UAE rose by 12 percent to 2.9
billion dollars in 1998 compared to 2.5 billion dollars in 1997,

SHANGHAI, July 11 (Xinhua) -- A total of more than 17,600
overseas-funded enterprises were registered in China's leading
economic powerhouse by the end of 1998, a 7.68 percent rise over

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Mayon Still in Abnormal State -- Institute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' Mayon Volcano is
still in an abnormal state, although seismic network has not
recorded any volcanic quake in the past 24 hours, the Philippine
Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued here, the Phivolcs said that Mayon
showed a further decline in sulfur dioxide flux Saturday from
1,900 tons per day to 1,370 tons.
</P>
<P>
"Steaming activity varied from wispy to weak most of the time.
Moderate steam emissions were often observed after rainfall
occurrences in the crateral area," the institute said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the downward trend in the observed parameters, the
Phivolcs said, it does not mean the volcano is going back to its
normal state.
</P>
<P>
"Historical records show that a lull in the volcano's activity
sometimes indicates that the magma or the molten rock material is
already emplaced in the upper part of the volcano's conduit," it
said.
</P>
<P>
In view of the foregoing observations, the institute reiterated
Alert Level 2 for the volcano, which is about 330 kilometers
southeast of Manila.
</P>
<P>
Alert Level 2 means the public should not venture inside the
delineated six-kilometer radius permanent danger zone and the
seven-kilometer safety buffer zone in the southeast sector.
</P>
<P>
On June 22, Mayon's mild eruption rained ash over surrounding
towns of the volcano.
</P>
<P>
Mayon's last major eruption on February 2, 1993 killed 78
people and affected 17,119 people.

<HEADLINE> Annan Discusses Nigeria's Role in S. Leone, U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We've had a very frank discussion, going over developments
since the new government took office and reviewing the situation
in the subcontinent and on the continent of Africa," said Annan at
a press conference after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed Sierra Leone and the ECOMOG troops, and the
heroic work they have done, and we talked about the Democratic
Republic of the Congo," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Many world politicians including him had earlier expressed
concerns over Nigeria's possible withdrawal from the force, which
had reinstated Sierra Leone's elected President Tejan Kabbah and
kept him in the presidency since March last year.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leone rebels the Revolutionary United Front has a
predominating military advantage over Kabbah's neglected
government troops.
</P>
<P>
But Nigeria has already said it would begin a phased withdrawal
of its troops from ECOMOG following the signing of a Sierra Leone
peace accord on Wednesday night in Togo's capital Lome.
</P>
<P>
Also discussed was the permanent seat issue on the United
Nations Security Council. Nigeria has been trying to thrust into
the top club of the world organization by claiming it has the
Africa's largest population.
</P>
<P>
But Annan termed the question as "thorny" since on our own
continent, Nigeria, Egypt and South Africa become contenders and
"this is a very thorny issue," Annan told the Press conference.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the question of debt relief for Nigeria had also
been raised. While this was more likely, now that reforms were
taking place, he said he could make no promises.
</P>
<P>
Annan has expressed optimism over the African continent and
Nigeria's reform process before his meeting with Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
"I have always said it is only when we Africans, with the
support of the international community, can settle the conflicts
that we have on this continent that we can move forward and
concentrate on economic and social issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has "turned the corner and set an example in the rule
of law and respect for human rights for other African countries",
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"I know the new government is determined to get its
macroeconomics policies right and move the country forward on
economic and social development."
</P>
<P>
He lauded the Sierra Leone Peace Accord signed on Wednesday and
the cease-fire deal on the civil war in the Democratic Republic of
Congo due to be signed this weekend, and reiterated UN's pledges
to help bolster the lasting peace for the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Annan landed in Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, on the
last leg of his west African tour that has also taken him to
Sierra Leone and Liberia. Annan and Obasanjo leave Nigeria for a
summit of the Organization of African Unity in Algiers on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Palmprints Closely Related With Health, IQ, Student Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese university student of
life science has claimed that people's palmprints are decided by a
single gene, not multi-genes which is the widely accepted theory.
And he had discovered close relations between people's palmprints
and their health conditions as well as their intelligence quotient
(IQ).
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai-based Wenhui Daily recently carried the report on
Li Hui, a third-year student at the Life Science College of Fudan
University, one of China's top five universities in terms of
scientific research.
</P>
<P>
However, experts here said the hypothesis requires research on
more family trees, more people and ways to determine the exact
place of the gene on a chromosome.
</P>
<P>
If the hypothesis is proved to be true, it is expected to lay a
solid foundation for determination of diseases, intelligence and
father-son blood relations.
</P>
<P>
Li made the discovery after conducting a comprehensive study of
30 members of a pedigree and sample survey of 1,200 Shanghai
residents.
</P>
<P>
Li Hui's innovative thought has been confirmed by Tan Jiazhen,
an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and one of
China's leading experts in life science study. He is known for
encouraging young people to be creative and innovative in their
scientific research.
</P>
<P>
It has been widely accepted that the formation of the
palmprints and finger prints are decided by several genes and it
does not have a definite rule.
</P>
<P>
Li found that prints below the middle finger and ring finger
have apparent differences in arrangements and certain rules.
</P>
<P>
He also collected all the palmprints of all primates in the
Shanghai Zoo.
</P>
<P>
His thesis, entitled "evolution of palmprints and heredity" has
received attention from experts at home.

<TEXT>

<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The 3rd women's World Cup has been
a great success, said top official of the organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
Marla Messing, president and chief executive officer of the
organizing committee, said the 1999 World Cup has made history in
women's sport.
</P>
<P>
"In some way, we have all been a part of history. This tournament
has demonstrated how our sport is growing all over the world."
</P>
<P>
Now the development of women's soccer is the more interesting
topic. Another showcase is coming up at the Sydney Olympic Games
next September. Australia is also bidding for the 2003 women's
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 90,185 spectators went to Rose Bowl for the final
match between China and the United States and the match helped push
the average attendance to more than 38,500 for 17 tournament dates.
</P>
<P>
"The last two weeks have been an absolutely exhilarating
experience. As big as I thought this tournament could be, it has
been bigger." said Messing.
</P>
<P>
"We have established the FIFA women's World Cup as a world-class,
world-caliber, stand-alone event like no other in sports." said
Messing.
</P>
<P>
FIFA is also satisfied with the World Cup. FIFA spokesman Keith
Cooper said:"It's been a stupendous tournament. It's the level of
enthusiasm, which is partly due to the success of the American team
and the media reaction. If others are smart, they should think this
stuff is hot and see how the game has gained respectability and
popularity."

<HEADLINE> Stability, Peace Precondition for Development: OAU Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim said
Saturday that stability and peace is the precondition for Africa's
social development and economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out in his report to the 70th ordinary session of
the organization's Council of Ministers here that ethnic
upheavals, civil wars and multilateral conflicts are still
plaguing the continent's development and threatens to hinder it
further in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
African leaders are unprecedentedly unanimous in their views
that unless proper measures are taken, the continent would surely
be left behind further and its survival is likely to be in danger.
</P>
<P>
At present, war and conflict still exist in one third of
sub-Saharan countries. The wars result in millions of refugees and
heavy loss of properties, infrastructure and innocent lives.
</P>
<P>
Salim noted that the OAU and many African leaders have made
continuous efforts to prevent the spilling and deterioration of
these wars, but with little success. Now, the ethnic hatred in
many African countries deepens the eruption of renewed conflicts.
The border war between Ethiopia and Eritrea began to flare up
after a short repose.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the continued deterioration of the situation
between the two Horn of African neighbors could cause negative
implications for the region and beyond.
</P>
<P>
The Congo (K) civil war sucked in six countries soon after its
eruption in early August of 1998. The two sides sent a total of
more than 100,000 troops into the abyss of war, casting a shadow
over the fragile peace process of the third largest African
country.
</P>
<P>
What is more, the continent has witnessed the resurgence of the
phenomenon of coup d'etat. Since the last sessions of Council and
Summit, coups have been perpetrated by the military in several
countries including Guinea Bissau, Niger and the Comoros. These
developments constitute a very disturbing trend and definitely a
severe setback to the ongoing process of democratization in the
continent.
</P>
<P>
Salim said in the report that these are brutal violations of
human rights and the basic principles of the United Nations and
the OAU and he called for immediate reversing of this trend.
</P>
<P>
Long years of war have destructed the poor infrastructure and
led to economic recession in these countries. Instability and
poverty form a vicious circle and engenders each other.
</P>
<P>
However, there is something encouraging. African leaders are
unprecedentedly aware of the daunting challenges and have spared
no effort to get rid of this insecurity.
</P>
<P>
Salim confessed that the instability is the most disturbing
thing for the continent. Social will not progress and economy will
not grow without peace and stability. To create a stable society
for development is the most pressing task every African leader
faces because it concerns the continent' s very survival in the
coming millennium.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 11 (Xinhua) -- More than 350,000 people
have visited this year's international trade fair in Tanzania,
compared with 310,000 last year, according to Tanzania's Deputy
Minister of Industries and Commerce, Shamim Khan.
</P>
<P>
Closing the eight-day 23rd Dar es Salaam International Trade
Fair here on Saturday evening, Khan said the event has attracted
more than 243 companies from 32 countries, compared with 201
firms from 23 countries last year.
</P>
<P>
During the fair, buyers' interests were shown in a number of
Tanzanian products, with trade enquiries made for tiles, marble,
horticultural products, door fittings, PVC pipes, handicrafts and
ball-point pens, as well as leather products, honey and bee wax,
furniture and wooden products, she said.
</P>
<P>
The total value of export orders received by Tanzanian
exhibitors is estimated at 15.97 million U.S. dollars and export
inquiries at 29.4 million U.S. dollars, according to preliminary
statistics provided by the Board of External Trade (BET), which
is the organizer of the annual event.
</P>
<P>
"The number of trade enquiries received during this year's fair
attests to our conviction that the Dar es Salaam International
Trade Fair can be an effective tool for promoting our exports,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister also emphasized the need for Tanzanian
products to internationally accepted standards.
</P>
<P>
Khan said participation by foreign enterprises has afforded the
 Tanzanian business community an opportunity to identify import
orders amounting to 7.65 million U.S. dollars and import enquiries
worth 148 million U.S. dollars. Spot sales amounted to 299.5
million Tanzanian shillings (about 405,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The 24th Dar es Salaam International Trade Fair will be held
during June 30 and July 8 next year, she said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Launch Massive Anti-Rabies Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government will
Launch a massive anti-rabies drive from July 31 this year to
eradicate deaths caused by the deadly disease in the country,
according to media sources here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said a major step is being taken by the health
authorities of Sri Lanka for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
There were at least 20 deaths in the country caused by rabies
during the first quarter of this year. The death toll is 79 in
1998 and 135 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
During the anti-rabies campaign last year, veterinarians
vaccinated 59,000 dogs, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Public Health Veterinary Services Director P.A.L. Harischandra
was quoted as saying that in the vaccination program, they also
educated over 20,000 people on the dangers of the disease and how
to avoid it.
</P>
<P>
In the coming anti-rabies campaign, veterinarians will go from
house to house and give oral vaccine to the dogs.
</P>
<P>
The present dog population in the country is around 2.2
million, of which about 10 percent is stray dogs.
</P>
<P>
As far as the stray dog population is concerned, the
authorities carries out a separate elimination program of 100,000
dogs a year usually in the endemic areas.

<HEADLINE> Material Evidence on Japan's Invasion Found in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 11 (Xinhua) -- A yellow china plate with the No.
1 blast furnace of the Benxi Iron &AMP; Steel Company and "Masahiko"
on the front and "20th Anniversary of the founding of the company
"on the back, has been recently found.
</P>
<P>
The Benxi Iron &AMP; Steel Company was originally set up by the
Qing feudal government and Okura Kihachiro, a Japanese tycoon, in
1911 when he was entitled to open coal and iron mines in China.
And it was then seized by the Okura financial group when the
Japanese troops occupied northeast China in 1931.
</P>
<P>
The No.1 blast furnace was built in 1914 and all the pig iron
was transported to Japan for the use of the Japanese navy. The
company was turned over to the contemporary Chinese government in
1945 when the Japanese invaders surrendered.
</P>
<P>
Historians said that this has been one of the few pieces of
rare material evidence that demonstrates how the Japanese invaders
robbed China of its mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese book named the "War History in the Chinese Mainland"
was discovered in the city in April as well, which was written by
a correspondent and intelligence personnel during the Japanese
invasion of China.
</P>
<P>
The book, published in 1941, contains Xuzhou Battles, Occupying
Nanjing, and lists the atrocities of the Japanese troops during
their stay in China.
</P>
<P>
What is most noticeable is that besides some 20 pictures of
their daily lives, it also includes about ten maps, on which all
the occupied Chinese cities were marked with a red bomb.
</P>
<P>
The book, aimed to publicize the grandeur of the Japanese
troops during the invasion, recorded all the details of the key
battles in China, which is undoubtedly another iron-clad piece of
evidence of the eight-year-long Japanese invasion in China which
began in 1937.

<HEADLINE> Thai Debtors Form Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Law Society of Thailand set up
a club on Saturday for troubled bank debtors who are under siege
from creditor banks, the Bangkok Post reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 bank debtors, mostly small and medium-sized
entrepreneurs, have signed up as members of the Club for the
Protection of Bank Debtors' Rights, the report said.
</P>
<P>
A large number of small and medium-sized entrepreneurs have run
into trouble since the bursting of the economic bubble in Thailand
in 1997, resulting in a call for the national grouping of lawyers
to help them.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the club was quoted as saying that the creation
of the club, first of its kind in Thailand, was not intended to
defy commercial banks but to help debtors and to highlight their
plight.
</P>
<P>
He said the debtors are being hard-pressed everyday by bankers
to pay their debts, but they have nowhere and nobody to turn to
for help. The club would provide free legal counselling to member
debtors who are in need of advice, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The club would also coordinate with creditor banks to help in
debt restructuring.

<HEADLINE> Aid Meeting Uncertain as S.Lanka Heads for Early Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The international Aid-Sri Lanka
consortium group meeting is not likely to be held in December this
year on schedule if the Sri Lankan government decides to go to
national polls by the end of the year, officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speculation is rife about a December poll - either presidential
or parliamentary - following President Chandrika Kumaratunga's
move last week to appoint a set of new deputy ministers and
reallocate the portfolios of others.
</P>
<P>
Officials believed that the government is certain to request
the donor meeting be postponed if a poll in December is on the
ruling People's Alliance' agenda.
</P>
<P>
However, they said there was no cause for alarm in the change
of dates.
</P>
<P>
"We are holding the meeting once in 18 months," an official
said, adding that the 1996 meeting was held in November while
there was no meeting in 1997.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the venue of the aid consortium meeting is
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
The meeting has always been held in Paris, but this time some
donor countries have suggested moving the venue to Colombo, which
Sri Lankan authorities are said not to be in favor of.
</P>
<P>
The meeting organized by the World Bank since the 1960s brings
together foreign donors, financial lending institutions including
the International Monetary Fund and the Asian Development Bank,
and Sri Lankan officials.
</P>
<P>
At last year's meeting, aid pledges totaling little over 700
million U.S. dollars were made by donors to the Sri Lankan
delegation led by Deputy Finance Minister G.L. Peiris.

<P>
YANGON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar Foreign Minister U Win Aung
will pay official visits to Sri Lanka and Bangladesh later this
month to strengthen bilateral ties with the South Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
U Win Aung will visit Sri Lanka on July 14-16 and Bangladesh on
July 17-19, according to an official announcement here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
U Win Aung's trip to South Asia comes after his tour of all 10
Southeast Asian nations except Cambodia during the first half of
this year.
</P>
<P>
In January 1996, Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lakshman
Kadirgamar came to Yangon for a visit, during which an agreement
on the establishment of a Joint Commission for Bilateral
Cooperation was signed between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
There was only a one-million-dollar investment project of Sri
Lanka in Myanmar by the end of February. Sri Lanka has had some
imports from Myanmar in the past few years, but its exports to
Myanmar were none, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
In April 1998, former Myanmar foreign minister U Ohn Gyaw
visited Dhaka and discussions were made on repatriation of Myanmar
refugees from Bangladesh, border trade and cooperation in joint
ventures.
</P>
<P>
Later in November that year, Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Abdus
Samad Azad visited Yangon, during which an agreement on the
inland boundary of the northern part of the Naaf River was signed.
The Myanmar-Bangladesh boundary is made up of the Naaf River part
and the inland part.
</P>
<P>
The two countries initiated formal border trade at Maungtaw
(Myanmar)- Teknaf (Bangladesh) trade point in September 1995.
Their bilateral trade stands at about 8 million U.S. dollars
annually.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are all members of the
BIMST-EC, a sub-regional economic grouping formed in June 1997 by
Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand bordering the
Bay of Bengal.

BUENOS AIRES, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Hosts Paraguay was knocked
out of the Copa America soccer tournament in Asuncion, Paraguay on
Saturday, losing on penalties to a Uruguay team that decided
against bringing their top players to the tournament.
</P>

Paraguay took a half-time lead with Benitez netting the goal in
the 15th minute  But Marcelo Zalayeta leveled in the 65th
minute with his third goal of the Cup, shooting home from outside

By this time, Uruguay were in control and only a world class
save by Ricardo Tavarelli, who saved with his legs from an
unsighted position, stopped Zalayeta from decided the match
without the help of penalties.

BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The People's Liberation Army (PLA)
is to set up high-tech training courses for its officers so as to
improve their qualities and skills and help them win any potential
future high-tech regional wars and confrontations.
</P>
<P>
The PLA's Headquarters of the General Staff, General Political
Department, General Logistics Department and General Armament
Department have jointly issued an circular recently calling for
the further education of officers.
</P>
<P>
PLA officers are required to learn and master new military
theories, new techniques and new arms skills, taking into account
scientific military developments and the upgrading of weapons.
</P>
<P>
According to the overall plan of the four departments, the PLA
will strive to build up its further education system in the next
three to five years.
</P>
<P>
The document requires that further education should focus on
improving the army's combat effectiveness and turn the PLA into an
army that lays stress on scientific and technological level rather
than on the size of troops.
</P>
<P>
PLA departments concerned are also asked to adopt new
regulations to guarantee the regular further training of officers.

<HEADLINE> China to Promote Secondary Housing Market in Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- China is to work out a series of
regulations relating to the second-hand housing market in the
coming two months, China Daily's Business Weekly reported today.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Ministry of Construction said that more than
30 large and medium-sized cities have opened their secondary
housing market since May when the ministry announced a regulation
allowing owners to sell second-hand public and economy housing for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
The official said that China's secondary housing market need
rules to regularize its operation, since it is still in its
initial stage.
</P>
<P>
Shen Jianzhong, deputy director-general of the department of
housing and real estate industry of the ministry, said that only
after cities have established housing files for their residents,
worked out methods to manage the income from sales of old housing,
and solved the problems of unfair occupation of housing can they
open the market.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the second-hand housing market would help
improve the country's real estate market and expand domestic
demand, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If one percent of the existing housing could ultimately change
hands each year, China's real estate market would be very vigorous,
" he added.
</P>
<P>
A survey on families in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou
suggests that more than one-third of them were unsatisfied with
their existing housing.
</P>
<P>
However, China's secondary housing market still has many
problems.
</P>
<P>
Insufficient information services have left people unable to
make any decision since they cannot find the kind of housing they
are looking for.
</P>
<P>
The services offered by the intermediaries, banks and policy
consultancy departments were also not sufficient or quick enough.
</P>
<P>
The issue of property right, a key element to the secondary
housing market, remain unclear.

<HEADLINE> China's Taxation Policies on Poverty-hit Regions Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- China will not revise its current
preferential taxation policies for land-locked poverty-stricken
areas, Chinese taxation official said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is encouraging both foreign and domestic
investors to go to the country's relatively underdeveloped central
and west regions in search of business opportunities, said Lu Yun,
director of the Tax Policy Division of the State Administration of
Taxation.
</P>
<P>
He said that China will not make any new regional favorable tax
policies, despite strong calls from experts to revise the country'
s taxation policies in general to give impetus to economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Business Weekly said that since 1980, China has implemented an
array of preferential tax policies for foreign investors,
encouraging them to set up manufacturing businesses in special
economic zones, the 14 coastal port cities and other opened-up
areas in the southern and eastern provinces.
</P>
<P>
New tax favors will be allocated between different industrial
sectors rather than according to geographical factors, he said.
</P>
<P>
In order to facilitate efforts to develop the inland areas, the
SAT is considering removing geographical limitations on some of
the existing industry-based preferential tax policies to cover the
central and western regions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Equalizing tax policies between the coastal and inland areas is
an encouragement to investing in the latter, he said.
</P>
<P>
The central and western areas have inherent economic advantages
like cheaper labor and abundant natural resources, whose appeal to
investors will grow when tax disparities are ironed out.

for the title of the 3rd women's World Cup here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>

the title on the fifth shot of a penalty kick shoot-out.
</P>
<P>
American goal-keeper Briana Scurry dove to the right to save an
attempt by Liu Ying on China's third shot. After the next two
players on each side converted their opportunities, Brandi Chastain
scored past Chinese goal-keeper Gao Hong to end the tournament.
</P>
<P>
The shoot-out began with China shooting first. Xie Huilin
stepped to the line to take the first kick and scored to the left
side of the goal. Carla Overbeck took the U.S.'s first shot and
also scored, beating Gao Hong to the right side of the goal.
</P>

<P>
Scurry anticipated well Liu Ying's shot and saved the attempt.
The save decided the result of the match.

The match opened with both teams playing with controlled
aggression as they pushed forward and attacked but were careful not
to expose themselves to counterattack.

team, but neither team had few real chances of threatening
opponents' goal.

half. Despite continued attacking play in the second half, still no
goals were scored and the game was sent into extra time which adopts
golden goal regulation.
</P>
<P>
China nearly ended the game in the first 15 minutes of the extra
time when Fan Yunjie headed a corner kick onto goal. Scurry had no
cance to save the shot, but Kristine Lilly was positioned perfectly
to clear the ball off the line.
</P>
<P>
The match drew 90,185 fans to the Rose Bowl, far surpassing the
record attendance for a women's sporting event.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hungarians Commemorate Late Party Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Hungarians gathered
here Saturday before the monument to the workers' movement in the
Kerepesi cemetery to mark the 10th anniversary of the death of
their former leader Kadar Janos.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Hungarian Workers' Party Thurmer Gyula spoke
highly of Kadar's historical achievements, saying that during more
than 30 years' reign of Kadar, the Hungarian people enjoyed social
stability and a guaranteed life.
</P>
<P>
During that period, he added, the Hungarians peacefully
coexisted with people all over the world and regained their
national pride. All these, including the 20th-century "Hungarian
economic miracle", were all closely linked with the name of Kadar.
</P>
<P>
Madame Barta, who served as Kadar's secretary from 1960 to 1989,
told Xinhua that she comes here every year to pay respect to Kadar
whose biggest accomplishment, she said, was to ensure the people's
stable life.
</P>
<P>
After the commemoration ceremony which started in the Hungarian
national anthem and ended in the internationale, scores of
representatives of social organizations and mass groups laid
wreaths at the graves of Kadar and his wife.
</P>
<P>
Kadar, ex-Chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party (
HSWP) and one of the key leaders of the country, died on July 6,
1989 at the age of 77. The HSWP was renamed the Hungarian
Socialist Party on October 7, 1989.

<HEADLINE> Juvenile Delinquency Increases in Chile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The number of teenagers
committing robbery with violence in Chile increased 207 percent
between 1995 and 1998, according to a report of the Citizens Peace
Foundation Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Robberies by adults rose only 35 percent during the same period.
</P>
<P>
The report said that despite the accelerated increase of
juvenile delinquency, only 13 percent of them are given a penal
punishment.
</P>
<P>
Among the 21,018 teenagers detained in 1998, 37 percent are
under 16 and 55 percent were released without going to court.
</P>
<P>
Robbery and assault are the main reasons for which the youths
are detained.
</P>
<P>
Citizens Peace Foundation general manager Carlos Valdivieso
said that the young infractors are encouraged to commit crimes
because they cannot find a solution to their sad socio-economic
situation in the system.
</P>
<P>
Most of the young people start to commit crimes before they
reach 18 and they have experience of family violence, bad behavior
or economic straits.
</P>
<P>
The study also finds that most of them commit a crime for
economic causes or to acquire drugs and their friends have a
criminal background.

SHENYANG, July 11 (Xinhua) -- China is preparing to turn a
major hospital in northeastern Liaoning province into the country'
s first analgesia, or pain free, hospital for cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
A local medical care official said that from September doctors
in the Liaoning Provincial Tumor Hospital will begin to widely use
morphine and other alleviates to ease the patients' suffering as
much as they can.
</P>
<P>
The move follows the WHO's recommendation that morphine should
be generally introduced as a pain-killer throughout the world by
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The official added that so far Chinese hospitals have not yet
paid enough attention to the algophobia experienced by cancer
patients, and there isn't any scientific and systematic method to
deal with the issue.
</P>
<P>
A special watchdog group will be set up to prevent the medicine
from going to drug addicts, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Mountains of Bamboo Slips Found in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, July 11 (Xinhua) -- More than 200,000 pieces of
bamboo slips on which words were written, with the earliest dating
back to 2,000 years, have been unearthed in China this century,
archeologists announced at a recent meeting.
</P>
<P>
Bamboo and wooden slips were widely used by Chinese scholars as
books and files before paper was invented here in the 2nd century
A.D. The first piece was discovered on the Silk Road in 1901 in
northwest China's Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
The words on the slips have helped people understand ancient
political systems, military operations, astronomic research,
medicine and economies, as well as cultural achievements,
according to the archaeologists.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 Chinese provinces have reported the discovery of
bamboo slips. The most exciting finding was made in 1996 when
archeologists unearthed 170,000 pieces of bamboo slips from a tomb
in central China's Hunan province.
</P>
<P>
The use of bamboo slips was a major reform after ancient
Chinese had been inscribing words on tortoise shells and animal
bones for centuries.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of scholars from the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong,
Taiwan and even foreign countries are studying these slips.
However, they are still unable to explain the meaning of some of
the words.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Air Force To Install Base in Antarctica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean Air Force announced
Saturday that it will set up a permanent base on the Patriot Hills
ice plains of the Antarctic Polar Circle.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the base, a fiberglass module with rooms
for 15 persons, will be completed in November by personnel from
the air force.
</P>
<P>
The project aims at facilitating the air force to perform its
tasks in the white continent during austral spring (October-
January).
</P>
<P>
The Chilean Air Force has maintained its presence in the
Patriot Hill since 1995.
</P>
<P>
It provides supports for the Chilean Antarctic Institute. It
also built a landing strip at the foot of the Ellsworth mountain
range in the Patriot Hill plains, 1,100 kilometers north of the
South Pole.
</P>
<P>
Chile has three permanent bases -- Bernardo O'Higgins (Army),
Arturo Pratts (Navy) and President Eduardo Frei Montalva -- all
with personnel who remain all the year in Antarctica, engaging in
scientific activities.

<HEADLINE> Uruguayan Jobless Rate Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Uruguay's unemployment rate for
the March-May period grew 0.6 percent to 11.7 percent, the highest
since the first quarter of 1997, according to the official figures
published Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The March-May jobless rate was 12.8 percent in Montevideo where
half of the country's 3.2 million population live, while the rate
in other parts of the country reached 10.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The National Statistics Institute figures show that the 12.8
percent unemployment rate in Montevideo is 2.7 percentage points
higher than that of the corresponding period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The recession that plagues the Uruguayan economy is the main
cause for the worsening employment situation.
</P>
<P>
The most affected sectors were services in general, banking and
finances while the job situation improved slightly in the
construction, transports and communications sectors.

<HEADLINE> China Reaps Four Golds in Universiade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PALMA, Spain, July 10 (Xinhua) -- China savored the biggest
victory by reaping four out of 21 gold medals at stake at the 20th
Universiade here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women spikers rallied from two sets down to beat
their Russian peers, winning the women's volleyball crown 16-25,
19-25, 25-21, 25-19 and 15-11 in two hours after the Chinese
divers claimed three titles through Fu Mingxia in the women's
three-meter springboard and both the men's and women's team titles.
</P>
<P>
"Our women spikers achieved their confidence from the third set
with their quick-set attacks and successful blocks, which in
return dampened the Russians mentally," said Zhen Jiucheng,
manager of the Chinese volleyball delegation.
</P>
<P>
"The first attacks from the third set on kept our squad scoring
steadily, and the rhythm of the blocks made us achieving the
leading margins, which make the difference for the Chinese squad
between the first two sets and the following three ones," said the
Chinese manager.
</P>
<P>
With spiker Gamova at the height of 2.05 meters, the Russians
resorted to simple tactics of high-altitude attacks, and were
stopped from scoring their third set victory as the Chinese
enjoyed their upperhands with varified tactics with backcourt
defense, solid defense and quick attacks.
</P>
<P>
Gui Chaoran and Li Yizhi were the keys for the Chinese success
with quick attacks which interrupted the rhythm for the Russians,
while setter Feng Kun and substitute Mao Julan contributed to the
victory with blocks and attacks.

<HEADLINE> Decision Delayed on Vote Registration in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Saturday postponed his decision on
the date of vote registration in East Timor for security concerns.
</P>
<P>
He announced this in a letter to the Security Council. He said
continuing violence in the territory led him to delay until July 16
to decide on whether to proceed with the registration of the vote
on the future of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Annan originally set July 13 as the time for the registration.
Now he said "The requisite certification" of security conditions
would be confirmed on Friday if concrete progress is made in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with a population of 800,000, had been a Portuguese
colony until 1975 when Indonesia occupied it amid a civil rift in
the territory.
</P>
<P>
In 1976 Indonesia made it a province. The United Nations has
since called it a non-self-governing territory with Indonesia as
its administering power.
</P>
<P>
Under U.N. mediation, Indonesia and Portugal reached agreement
on May 5 this year on a vote or "popular consultation" to see
whether the local people want special autonomy with Indonesia or
independence.
</P>
<P>
The parties agreed that the U.N. will organize and conduct the
ballot. The voting date was originally set for August 8, but Annan
put it off by two weeks to have better logistics preparations and
secure conditions.
</P>
<P>
East Timor Pro-independence and pro-integration militias have
reportedly been active, even threatening normal activities of U.N.
personnel in the territory.

<HEADLINE> Italy Urges More Action to Protect Serbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Italian Defense Undersecretary Paolo
Guerrini said Saturday that ethnic Albanian revenge attacks
against Serbs in Kosovo has to be stopped.
</P>
<P>
He accused KFOR peacekeepers in the province of doing too
little to disarm the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA).
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a visit to the war-devastated province, Guerrini
said that "it was terrible to see the KLA setting fire to the
homes of Serbs, this spiraling violence must be halted at once."
</P>
<P>
"All military contingents in Kosovo must work toward the
disarming of the KLA and the demilitarization of that organization,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Italian peacekeeping troops were doing this in
their sector, in the western part of the province which has common
borders with Montenegro and Albania.
</P>
<P>
"But the Italian contingent cannot be the only one committed to
seeing that the peace accords are respected in their entirety,
suffering excessive and unfair exposure to the KLA," Guerrini said.
</P>
<P>
"All allied countries must realize the seriousness of the risks
involved and act accordingly," he said. "We cannot now accept
ethnic cleansing against Serbs."
</P>
<P>
He also warned that "the insistence of some ethnic Albanian
representatives on the independence of Kosovo cannot but lead to
the renewal of the conflict."

<HEADLINE> China Wins Women's Volleyball in Universiade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PALMA, Spain, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese women spikers
rallied from two sets down to beat their Russian peers, winning
the women's volleyball crown here Saturday evening at the 20th
Universiade.
</P>
<P>
From a slow start, the Chinese adjusted their tactics with
attention paid to blocks and backcourt defense to secure the title
16-25, 19-25, 25-21, 25-19 and 15-11 in two hours battle.
</P>
<P>
"Our players achieved their confidence from the third set with
their quick-set attacks and successful blocks, which in return
dampened the Russians mentally," said Zhen Jiucheng, manager of
the Chinese volleyball team.
</P>
<P>
"The first attacks from the third set on kept our squad scoring
steadily, and the rhythm of the blocks made us achieving the
leading margins, which make the difference for our girls between
the first two sets and the following three," said the Chinese
manager.
</P>
<P>
The Russians with spiker Gamova at the height of 2.05 meters
resorted to simple tactics of high-altitude attacks, made easy
leads in the first two sets as the Chinese committed a string of
errors in team-work.
</P>
<P>
From 8-6, the Russians leapt to 16-9 before claiming the first
set, and again rushed to 8-5 and 16-10 before Gamova awarded her
squad a comfortable 2-0 lead with a solid block.
</P>
<P>
However, Gui Chaoran and Li Yizhi pulled the Chinese 8-7 to
lead for the first time in the third set, broke away from 14-all
to 20-15 with blocks and rallied from the brink with at least five
successful blocks.
</P>
<P>
The fourth set was a repetition of the previous one as the
Chinese made it 11-10 ahead for the first time and rushed to 16-13
with quick attacks and heavy spikes from substitute Mao Julan.
</P>
<P>
Mao Julan scored for China 19-14 with an unanswered ace serve
before China levelled with a drop from Li Wen and quick-set moves
from Li Yizhi and Gui Chaoran.
</P>
<P>
In the decisive fifth set, the Chinese broke away from 4-all to
8-5 for the exchange of courts and led all the way by two points
at least before Li Wen and setter Feng Kun blocked the attack from
Gamova to secure the hard-fought victory.
</P>
<P>
"Our players were a little bit intimidated in the first two
sets as they were fighting against the opponents without height
advantages for the first time in the tournament," Zhen said.
</P>
<P>
"The victory has a lot to do with the Chinese media and their
men peers," said Zhen to the fact that the stadium echoed waves
of beats and shouts as both cheering squads competed against each
other in the stands with deafening sounds.
</P>
<P>
"However, the Russians deserve our attention in the Olympic
qualifiers as they are expected to mature enough in two to three
years," the Chinese manager predicted.
</P>
<P>
In other matches, France defeated Japan 25-23, 30-32, 25-20 and
25-23 to take the bronze medal, while Spain rallied from two sets
down to breeze over Chinese Taipei for the fifth place 21-25, 21-
25, 25-20,25-17 and 15-7.
</P>
<P>
Thailand finished seventh by beating Romania 25-23, 25-17 and
25-16, with the United States placed ninth after a four-set
victory over Canada 25-14, 25-20, 23-25 and 25-23.
</P>
<P>
Brazil was in 11th spot as it beat the Czech Republic 25-18, 25-
19,22-25 and 25-21, Ukraine claimed the 13th berth by defeating
Switzerland 25-18, 19-25, 25-14 and 25-23, while South Africa
remained winless to tail in the tournament as it lost to Sweden 9-
25, 9-25 and 12-25.

Lilly header.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Fu Wants More after Achieving Double </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PALMA, Spain, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Fu Mingxia of China pulled
off a double again, this time in the World University Games.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old ponytailed diver, who accomplished the same
feat with double wins in women's springboard and platform in 1996
Olympics, garnered 550.230 points on Saturday to claim the
springboard gold in what was called a preview of next year's
Olympics diving competition.
</P>
<P>
Fu, who had bagged the platform gold, was all compact,
controlled, muscular grace on the springboard and led all the way
throughout, beating Russia's Irina Lashko and Ioulia Pakhalina
into second and third.
</P>
<P>
Lashko managed 528.300 and Pakhalina, whose botched second dive
earned her a meagre 47.700, got the bronze with a collection of
521.010 points.
</P>
<P>
"This is a major step after my comeback, " said Fu, who won
sports fans' hearts with Olympic gold medal performance in 1992
and 1996 and then broke theirs by retiring at age 19.
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy with this win, for I have beaten my toughest
rivals," she said.
</P>
<P>
"This can be called a preview of next year's Olympic diving, as
my main opponents then will probably also be Lashko and Pakhalina.
"
</P>
<P>
"I have the possibility to win golds next year in the Olympic
Games, but that calls for more efforts from myself," she said.
</P>
<P>
After three years' study in Chinese prestigious Qinghua
University, Fu, from the 12-year-old who became the youngest
diving world champion in 1991, has grown into a confident 21-year-
old with a ready laugh and twinkling coffee-brown eyes.
</P>
<P>
She said her campus career helped her become more mature.
</P>
<P>
"Now I become mature and can observe things in perspective,"
she said. "Moreover, I made some improvement in my diving skills."
</P>
<P>
Fu, who was culled at age 10 to practise diving, retired after
1996 Olympics and enrolled at Qinghua University.
</P>
<P>
"I was psychologically jaded then, and I needed some rest," she
said.
</P>
<P>
But she had second thought last summer and resumed training
with Qinghua diving team.
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to give it a try, to see whether it was possible
for me to be good," she said.
</P>
<P>
By studying economic management in the morning, she trained
four to five hours every afternoon, with weekends off.
</P>
<P>
"I found myself still deeply fond of diving, and I want to
achieve more," said Fu, who was the first woman in 36 years to
achieve a gold double in Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Fu's performance in the Universiade impressed nearly every
coach.
</P>
<P>
"Her recovery was just too quick, even beyond our expectation,"
said Australia's diving coach Chen Wen, a former Chinese coach.
</P>
<P>
"She is simply a phenomenon," Chen added.
</P>
<P>
Chen's view was echoed by his American peer Jim Hocking.
</P>
<P>
"Fu is too fantastic, and she is approaching her best," Hocking
said. "If she keeps going like this, It will be a plainsailing for
her to win in Sydney."
</P>
<P>
Yu Fen, Fu's long-time coach, said her protege dives even
better than before and has what it takes to win in Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"Her goal, of course, is to pursue Olympic gold. An athlete,
who does not want to win Olympic gold, I think, is not a good
athlete," she said.
