YANKEES ARE DAZZLED BY PHLLIES, WITH SCHILLING NEXT

   PHILADELPHIA _ Sweat listened on every face and arm at Veterans
Stadium Monday night, but the heat seemed to have a special effect
on the Yankees. They played most of the game as if they had been
locked in a sauna for half the day, and they are in jeopardy of
getting kicked in the teeth by the Phillies this week.
</P>
<P>
   The hustling, scrappy Phillies survived a ninth-inning rally to
win the first game of the three-game interleague series, 6-5, with
a favorable pitching match-up for Philadelphia to come Tuesday.
Paul Byrd, a former Met who has perfected his ability to change
speeds, pitched eight strong innings in the humid 92 degrees and
improved his record to 8-3.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre, the Yankees manager, called a team meeting after the
game and noted how the Phillies had thoroughly beaten them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took it to us, they played us off the field,'' Torre told
reporters. ``They were very confident and we were flat-footed.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Derek Jeter: ``We didn't really step it up until the ninth
inning. We've got to play hard for nine innings.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees went 2 for 13 with runners in scoring position and
for the second consecutive day, they missed a chance to move into
first place in the American League East. The Yankees are 32-23, a
half-game behind the Boston Red Sox who lost in Montreal Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Curt Schilling, who ranks among the National League leaders in
almost every significant pitching category, spent much of Monday
afternoon studying videotape of the Yankees, giving off the
distinct impression that he is more than serious about his start
Tuesday night. Schilling's opponent will be Hideki Irabu, who has
been more baffling to his manager and coaches than to the hitters
he faces.
</P>
<P>
   At only one juncture before the ninth inning of tonight's game
did it seem as if the Yankees were the predators, rather than those
preyed upon, and a baserunning gaffe cost them a chance for a run.
Joe Girardi was on third base and Chuck Knoblauch on first with two
out in the sixth inning, Yankees trailing 2-0, and Jeter hooked a
ground ball down the third base line, the ball bounding past the
bag and toward the left field corner.
</P>
<P>
   Girardi scored easily, while the left fielder Ron Gant moved
toward the corner, assuming the ball would roll there. But it
turned and bounced off the facing of the stands, rolling back
toward the infield, away from Gant, and in Torre's mind, Knoblauch
should have at least had a chance to race home and tie the score.
</P>
<P>
   But Knoblauch had slowed as he rounded second and eased into
third, believing he had no chance to score. ``I guess I made a
mistake,'' said Knoblauch, ``by using my own judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill grounded out to end the Yankees' rally, and on the
very first pitch thrown in the bottom of the sixth by Andy Pettitte
after that discouraging sequence, Scott Rolen smashed a home run _
a devastating 1-2 punch.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees closed to 3-2, but Jason Grimsley allowed five walks
and three runs over the next two innings, his last pitch going all
the way to the backstop on the fly, and as the ninth inning
started, Philadelphia led, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   But Wayne Gomes, who took over for Byrd, walked three batters,
Rolen made an error, a passed ball scored a run and O'Neill hit a
run-scoring single with two out. Bernie Williams then batted with
runners at first and second and a chance to give the Yankees a
lead. But Williams grounded into a game-ending force at second
base.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Torre had said the Yankees would not experience
a let down after the weekend series with the Mets. But then he
watched Philadelphia take it to the Yankees. The Phillies are young
and athletic and play hard, and there were moments when the Yankees
looked as if they were merely foils for a Philadelphia exhibition;
the Washington Generals for the Harlem Globetrotters.
</P>
<P>
   One came after Jeter smacked a one-out triple in the fourth
inning. O'Neill chopped a ground ball to third and Jeter broke for
the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Rolen gloved the ball, threw homeward, and Jeter stopped about
40 feet short of the plate, intent on getting himself into a
rundown and allowing O'Neill to reach second base. Mike Lieberthal,
the Philadelphia catcher, charged up the third base line with the
ball in hand, operating the rundown expertly. When Jeter headed
back to third, Lieberthal zipped a throw to Rolen, who had come
down the line to close the gap on Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies' third baseman slapped a tag on Jeter, whirled and
fired to second, where Kevin Jordan dropped his glove on the
sliding O'Neill. Double play, end of rally, end of inning, so crisp
that it should have been accompanied by ``Sweet Georgia Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Yankees did let down, Torre mused afterward. ``They
beat us, and they beat us soundly,'' he said.

ANDRO RISKS ARE IGNORED
</HEADLINE>

By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Now we know why Mark McGwire cries at press
conferences and crusades on behalf of abused children. It's the
androstenedione.
</P>
<P>
   A scientific study conducted by researchers at Iowa State
concluded the controversial weight-training supplement favored by
McGwire leads to higher levels in the blood of the female hormone
estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, if it were only that increased levels of estrogen in men
produced no side effect worse than an uncontrollable urge to shout
directions from the backseat or, in McGwire's case, a compulsion to
ask every opposing batter who reaches first base, ``Do you think
these pants make me look fat?''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, higher levels of estrogen in men can increase the risk
of heart disease and pancreatic cancer and decrease their store of
HDL, or ``good'' cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   That was the conclusion drawn by the Iowa State researchers at
the end of their eight-week study of 19 men. Their results were
published last week in the ``Journal of the American Medical
Association.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, their sampling is as small as the strike zone. It
wouldn't shock us if any given major-league organization has that
many players taking andro. These days, you buy into ``The Natural''
at your naivete's own peril.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire isn't the only user, just the only one careless enough
to keep a bottle of the stuff in his locker where a reporter could
see it.
</P>
<P>
   Given all the criticism McGwire has had to field (including in
this space), we'd be surprised if any other andro users in the
major leagues step forward. They might be foolish, but they're not
stupid.
</P>
<P>
   They're also perfectly free to use the stuff. That's because
major-league baseball, which is in the process of conducting its
own research on the substance, hasn't followed the lead of the IOC,
the NFL and the NCAA in banning andro.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Nutrition Business Journal'' has estimated that 80,000
people tried andro in 1998, many of them no doubt drawn to it after
getting an eyeful of McGwire's bulging biceps and Herculean home
runs.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusions drawn from one laboratory in America's heartland
aren't going to sway the muscle-bound believers. If you think
otherwise, we've got a beauty pill we'd like to sell you.
</P>
<P>
   Angels outfielder Tim Salmon spoke the plain, sad truth over the
weekend when he said, ``There's always going to be people out there
doing things at all costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Players blinded by ambition aren't likely to see the health
risks. Football player Lyle Alzado spread the message that steroids
kill, and countless others have taken up his drumbeat since
Alzado's death in 1992. And yet, Salmon said, ``I can remember
talking to guys in the minor leagues who said, `If taking steroids
guarantees I'll get to the big leagues, I'll do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   If ballplayers are inclined to use steroids, which are illegal,
what's to stop them from taking andro, which is not? Probably
nothing short of a death or a few deaths. If that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put it this way,'' Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros said.
``If somebody is willing to take that risk in the first place, I
would imagine studies that show that it may be harmful aren't going
to have much of an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   He has a point.
</P>
<P>
   There are caveats posted about tobacco in both clubhouses at
Dodger Stadium. On Friday we walked into the visiting clubhouse and
there it was, plain for all to see. A sign that read, ``Due to the
increased health risks, tobacco products (cigarettes, chew and dip)
will not be available.''
</P>
<P>
   A few yards away, Angels slugger Mo Vaughn was reaching for his
smokeless tobacco. Never mind all the former chew and dip users _
ex-Dodger Brett Butler among them _ who have battled throat cancer,
Vaughn can't step into the batter's box without the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to have something in my mouth when I swing,'' Vaughn
said. ``Otherwise I grind my teeth. Bubble gum? I've tried it.
Doesn't work. I bite my tongue.''
</P>
<P>
   At that, we bit ours. Vaughn, who has endured many a lecture by
the likes of ex-catcher and anti-chew propagandist Joe Garagiola,
shrugged as if to say, ``I know, I know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny,'' Vaughn said. ``I only chew during the season.
And I'm always getting my mouth checked out. As long as the doctor
tells me I'm OK, I don't worry.''
</P>
<P>
   Skyrocketing salaries and swollen ERAs? Double-digit scores?
Pete Rose's status? If today's players aren't careful, those things
might turn out to be the least of baseball's concerns. &QL;

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
IT was a time when he could have gloated. A night when the Junkyard
Dog could have barked at all of the names and faces he had left
behind in Houston, when he could have chewed on leftover grudges
like they were an old bone.
</P>
<P>
   While the high-profile, big-name Rockets are nothing but a
long-forgotten playoff memory, Mario Elie is heading back to the
NBA Finals with the San Antonio Spurs. But instead of a sneer,
there was a smile. In the place of anger and ill feelings, there
was forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to come to terms with what happened in the past,''
Elie said in the aftermath of the Spurs' Western Conference finals
sweep of the Portland Trail Blazers. ``I've got to let all of that
stuff go now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some great years in Houston, some great experiences, and
I can't let the way it all ended ruin those memories.''
</P>
<P>
   You see him on the court _ his expressive face always speaking
louder than even the virtually nonstop barrage of words that comes
out of his mouth _ and he looks like the same scrappy, fearless
competitor who helped make up the guts of those two Rockets
championship teams in 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But talk to him away from the games these days, and he is
different. Aged. Changed. Grown to realize that carrying a grudge
is a burden that can weigh a man down and make for an unfulfilling
present.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult to leave Houston, I'll admit that,'' he said.
``I felt like I was a big part of the things we accomplished, and
after going there and finding a home, I didn't want to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems I had at the end all came from when they tried to
make me part of that trade to Toronto for (Damon) Stoudamire. I
have always told myself through all my years of trying to make it
in the NBA that I realized the game was actually just a business,
that business-type decisions had to be made, and you just had to
live with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when that trade situation came around, I'll admit that I
forgot all that, and I took it personally. I didn't handle it well.
I didn't handle myself the way I should have. Now that I look back
on it, my own attitude was the thing that made me bitter and left
me with a bad taste about those final few months last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was blessed to have a chance to play with the Houston
Rockets, and I want to thank Rudy (Tomjanovich) and the coaching
staff for helping me with my game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I know that I was wrong about the way I left. I shouldn't
have let it all build up inside and make me so angry.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a hurt that festered throughout the longer-than-usual
offseason and a grudge he carried with him to his new team in San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   There is little coincidence that Elie chose his moment just
prior to the Spurs' March 2 game in Houston, when San Antonio was
struggling with a 6-8 record, to stand up in the locker room and
tell his teammates that he expected more out of each of them.
</P>
<P>
   And there was no hiding the vengeful spirit that erupted from
him April 18 at the Alamodome when the Spurs rallied from 23 points
down and scored an emotional 86-83 victory over the Rockets on
Elie's dagger-in-the-heart 3-pointer just ahead of the final
buzzer. He pointed at the Rockets. He taunted them. He shouted in
the TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was like the volcano finally erupting,'' Elie said.
``When I hit that shot, when I won that game, that was all of the
emotion and disappointment and the anger about what happened coming
out. I did feel a real sense of accomplishment. It was a statement
that I had been wanting to make all season long.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when that game was over, I kind of got a new outlook on
things. It was like the pressure was off, and it was time for me to
let go of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   His role with the Spurs is no different than it was with the
Rockets. He is the last offensive option on a team that has so many
of them, and he scored just two points in the Game 4 clincher at
Portland. He is in the game to clamp on the defense like a bear
trap, and he kept the Blazers' explosive Isaiah Rider from ever
going off in the series.
</P>
<P>
   He was brought into the Spurs' locker room to provide a spark, a
ferocity that always had been lacking in this team. He was
recruited to San Antonio by Avery Johnson, another mile-a-minute
mouth who wanted help in pushing and prodding the other Spurs to
the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``You listen to Mario,'' said David Robinson. ``He's been there.
He helps us.''
</P>
<P>
   As they have helped him come to grips with the past.
</P>
<P>
   Two championship rings with the Rockets and a different kind of
ring with fiance Gina Gaston in Houston. Now a third trip to the
NBA Finals in San Antonio. And a revelation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no reason to be mad at anybody,'' said Mario Elie.
``Texas has been good to me.''

PACERS EVEN SERIES WITH A 90-78 VICTORY OVER KNICKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Knicks' pocket of miracles was empty as the
Indiana Pacers left nothing to chance by taking over Monday night's
game early and keeping their edge to the end of a 90-78 victory in
Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers tied the four-of-seven-game series, 2-2, and will
play the Knicks in Game 5 on Wednesday night in Indianapolis. It
was not the outcome the Knicks had hoped for when Latrell Sprewell
was given the start.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to score in the halfcourt around the likes of Chris
Mullin and Jalen Rose, Sprewell finished his first start of the
playoffs with 12 points. Sprewell was not the only starter to fade
into the background as Game 3's miracle worker, Larry Johnson,
finished with 11 points and hit just 1 of 7 from 3-point range.
Marcus Camby led the Knicks with 18 points and had 14 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither Rik Smits nor Reggie Miller scored in the first
half, the Pacers rode the edge of Mullin, Antonio Davis and Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Rose had 19 points, Mullin 18 and Davis 16 coming off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers shot 50 percent to the Knicks' 41 percent and made 22
of 30 free throws to the Knicks' 9 of 14.
</P>
<P>
   There were only a few minutes of uncertainty in this game. The
Pacers took a 14-point lead as the Knicks imploded at the hands of
tentative shot-taking by Johnson and the shocking inability of
Sprewell to win his matchup with Mullin. But as the Knicks have
done all season, they did not give in to a Pacers team that was
winning with its bench play.
</P>
<P>
   Camby shrugged off whatever rough treatment he was receiving
during the game and came up with a steal at midcourt on a Mark
Jackson pass and turned it into a soaring, one-handed dunk to pull
the Knicks within 7, 71-64, with 7 minutes 23 seconds left in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   But at this point, the Knicks were just able to trade baskets
with a Pacers team that took every punch Chris Childs delivered _
as he drove on Mark Jackson for two consecutive layups _ and
returned the favor with firm reactions. Rose came up with a wild
running layup with 4:28 left and drew a foul for a 3-point play to
put the Pacers up by 81-70.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed unthinkable for the Pacers to grab a 45-32 lead at the
break without either Smits or Miller scoring in the first half.
Smits had two fouls in the first 30 seconds and immediately
retreated to the bench for the rest of the half. Miller, who was
also called for two quick fouls, played a quiet 11 minutes and was
0 for 3 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   In stepped the Pacers' role players to provide the kind of depth
the Knicks have no answer for without the injured Patrick Ewing.
Reserves like Rose and Antonio Davis _ even Fred Hoiberg _ came off
the bench and supplied a total of 24 points, overwhelming any
lineup the Knicks had to offer.
</P>
<P>
   That included a starting lineup with Sprewell. Coach Jeff Van
Gundy's experiment did not work well in the first half. Close to
the time he would have normally come into the game off the bench,
Sprewell was leaving the floor with two fouls and 6:41 left in the
first quarter. He finished the first half 3 for 11, part of a
Knicks starting lineup that was 6 for 22 at the break.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks took a deep breath in the locker room and opened the
third quarter with an ounce more determination. Allen Houston and
Sprewell began to force the action and take the ball to the basket,
and the Knicks cut the Pacers' lead to 8 points in the first four
minutes of the third. The Pacers did not get flustered and found
Miller for a 3-pointer, then Mullin came up with a jumper to give
them a 55-42 lead with 6:47 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The mistake-prone Knicks then came up with a doozy when Charlie
Ward fouled Mullin on a 3-point attempt. Mullin made all three free
throws. Three minutes later, Johnson did the same thing to Miller,
who hit two of three free throws to put the Pacers up by a healthy
62-49.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were melting down at this point, countering their
good plays with mindless mistakes. Sprewell was the ringleader of
this by allowing Mullin, his former teammate from Golden State, to
fluster him on the defensive end and then beat him on the offensive
end. The Knicks were better off without him and went on an 11-6 run
to close within 9, 66-57, when the third quarter ended.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Sprewell was too eager in his first playoff start, too
pumped up by the introduction at the Garden. Out of control,
Sprewell was unable to slip around a slow but crafty Mullin, who
was winning a matchup that was expected to be in the Knicks' favor.
Sprewell was unable to break the Pacers' defensive code in the
halfcourt before halftime. His few successes came on the fast
breaks, which were kept to a minimum by a Pacers team that got back
quickly to defend. The plan was to beat the Pacers with the Knicks'
small but quick lineup.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing went according to plan for the Knicks in the first
half. Johnson, the hero of Game 3 with his 4-point play, was
tentative with every move into the paint, fumbling the ball and
passing up open looks from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' guards were no help, either. Houston, who was faced
with chasing Miller and then forced to guard Rose, was frayed
around the edges as he shot 1 for 4. Together, Sprewell, Houston
and Johnson were 6 for 19 in the first half.

 &HT;    $100 million buys supply for growing population
 &HT;    By Chuck Lindell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The City of Austin and the Lower Colorado River
Authority will announce today a $100 million water agreement that
would provide a drought-proof supply for the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   For a city that has suffered two destructive dry spells in the
past three years, that guarantee carries a lot of weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a turning point in Austin's history,'' Mayor Kirk
Watson said. ``The strength of our economy and the strength of our
quality of life are going to be based on the supply of water.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's agreement in principle would ensure Austin's water
supply _ even during a repeat of the decade-long drought of the
1950s _ as the city's population doubles to an estimated 1.6
million by 2050.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lot of money, but it's a lot of water guaranteed for
a long time,'' said Mark Rose, LCRA general manager.
</P>
<P>
   To pay for the $100 million deal, water rates would rise 10
percent by 2006, adding $28 a year to the average residential
customer's bill. Expect a 4 percent increase next year, followed by
smaller rises in following years.
</P>
<P>
   Austin will get a 30 percent discount on its water by paying for
it in advance _ $25 million the first year, followed by annual
payments of $6 million to $7 million over the next 20 to 30 years.
The payment schedule must be negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   The savings amount to almost $40 million over the life of the
contract, said Randy Goss, head of Austin's water utility.
</P>
<P>
   What else does Austin get for its $100 million?
</P>
<P>
   _The city will boost its water supply by 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Austin is entitled to 250,000 acre feet of Colorado River water
a year, or about 81.5 billion gallons, enough to last until the
mid-2030s. The new contract would add 75,000 acre feet, enough to
serve 375,000 a year while extending the city's supply to 2050.
</P>
<P>
   _Austin won't need to dip into that extra 75,000 acre feet until
the mid-2030s, but by reserving the water now, Austin is assured
that no other city or industry will swoop in to reserve the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to sell the water to anybody who asks for it,'' said
Paul Thornhill, engineering manager for the LCRA's water division.
``Once it's reserved, we can't sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   _The city will extend its contract with the LCRA until 2050,
with the option of deciding whether to extend its terms another 50
years. Austin's current contract with the LCRA can be voided by
either party as early as 2023.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement _ a memo of understanding reached after 10 months
of negotiation _ may be signed as early as today by Austin City
Manager Jesus Garza.
</P>
<P>
   Final details will be negotiated over the summer, and city staff
hopes to have a contract ready for City Council approval in August.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the memo of understanding will be circulated
among the city's boards and commissions. Presentations also will be
made to neighborhood associations and other interested groups.
</P>
<P>
   The new contract will replace a 1987 agreement that was part of
a hard-fought water-rights settlement among the City of Austin,
LCRA and state water officials.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement gave Austin the right to pump 250,000 acre feet a
year from the Colorado River _ the first 150,000 acre feet for
free, the rest at the LCRA's fee of $105 per acre foot.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the agreement has favored Austin. After all, the city
doesn't expect to cross the 150,000-acre-foot threshold for another
two or three years, providing almost 15 years of free water.
</P>
<P>
   But with time, the 1987 deal began to look shaky from Austin's
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is a clause that enables either the city or the LCRA
to void the contract as early as 2023 _ a situation that would
leave Austin in a predicament. Without the LCRA's water stored in
the Highland Lakes, Austin would run short during the dry years.
</P>
<P>
   That's because all of Austin's water rights are ``run of river''
rights _ meaning the city can pump water that would normally be
flowing down the Colorado River. During dry spells, the normal flow
of the Colorado doesn't come close to providing enough water to
quench Austin's thirst for green lawns, swimming pools and clean
cars.
</P>
<P>
   Without water stored behind the Highland Lakes dams, for
example, Austin would have fallen almost 33 percent short on water
during the 1996 drought, Goss said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without this historic agreement . . . there could be times of
the year, especially under drought conditions, when Austin would
have little or no ability to take water out of the river,'' Rose
said. ``That is not a good circumstance for anyone in Central
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed agreement and extension option, Austin could
ensure access to Highland Lakes water until the 22nd century.
</P>
<P>
   The city also would keep its annual right to pump 150,000 acre
feet for free but will pay the going rate _ $105 per acre foot _
for the next 51,000 acre feet. That water will cost about $36
million and is projected to last until 2021, after which Austin
will pay whatever water fee the LCRA is charging at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Austin also will pay about $64 million to reserve its additional
75,000 acre feet of water in the Highland Lakes. The normal
reservation fee would be $104 million over 50 years, but the LCRA
offered a discount to cement the deal and because Austin will
prepay in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The LCRA will spend the money to modernize its dams, improve its
flood-warning system and to pay for newly purchased water rights _
avoiding debt and saving on interest payments, Thornhill said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also would allow the LCRA to avoid a planned
increase in water rates.
</P>
<P>
   Rates for Highland Lakes water, frozen at $105 per acre foot
since 1992, are due to rise 5 percent annually for the next four
years to pay for this year's $75 million purchase of the Garwood
Irrigation Co.'s water rights.
</P>
<P>
   If a final contract is worked out, the LCRA can delay rate
increases for at least four years, Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   Austin plans to pay its first $25 million installment with money
from water-wastewater department projects that came in under budget
or were delayed.
</P>
<P>
   The $6 million to $7 million annual payments will be paid from
rate increases, Goss said.
</P>
<P>
   The city's memo of understanding will allow the LCRA to create a
``water bank'' to sell Austin's unused water in short-term
contracts. Austin, which must approve the sales, would be repaid
with future water or money.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides also agreed to negotiate provisions that would allow
Austin to scale back the contract if growth demands fall short.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a new contract providing 325,000 acre feet of water a
year, Austin will still fall 25,000 to 35,000 acre feet short of
its needs in 2050.
</P>
<P>
   The city plans to make up for the shortfall with an aggressive
campaign to encourage conservation and use treated wastewater for
irrigation. To meet its goals, Austin will have to almost triple
the amount of water it currently saves through conservation (4,250
acre feet per year) and reused wastewater (6,500 acre feet).
</P>
<P>
   Though ambitious, Goss believes the city can turn reused
wastewater into a third city utility that provides water to local
golf courses and other irrigators.
</P>
<P>
   Other ideas include stepped-up rebates for water-saving devices,
such as underground watering hoses that reduce evaporation.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The question drew a belly laugh from Rice baseball coach Wayne
Graham.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Would the Owls consider forfeiting their first game in the
College World Series against Miami on Friday so they could begin
their mental preparation for winning the tournament through the
losers bracket?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Graham said after he recovered. ``We've been behind the
eight ball long enough. I'd like to get out from behind it and feel
what that is like.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the question wasn't serious, it wasn't all that absurd.
Rice lost its first game in the double-elimination NCAA regional in
Lubbock and had to win four games in the losers bracket to move on.
Then, after dropping the first contest in their best-of-three super
regional against Southwestern Louisiana at the Astrodome, the Owls
won two games in a row to advance to the College World Series for
the second time in three years.
</P>
<P>
   The Owls were eliminated in two games in their previous CWS trip
in 1997. But Graham believes Rice's return to Omaha is going to be
special for his program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have a feeling that you belong when you go your
second time,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   The Owls had hoped to play at 12:30 p.m. Saturday in the game to
be telecast by CBS. But network officials chose the Texas
A&AMP;M-Florida State game for that slot, ostensibly because the large
state schools have more public recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee went with what CBS selected,'' said NCAA
Division I Baseball Committee chairman Dick Rockwell.
</P>
<P>
   The first CWS gme pairs Alabama and Oklahoma State at 2:30 p.m.
Friday. Rice and Miami follow at 6:30 p.m. in a game to be telecast
by ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State and A&AMP;M open the second day of action, with Cal
State Fullerton taking on Stanford at 7 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The four teams playing Friday will be in one bracket, playing a
double-elimination tournament among themselves to determine a
winner. The same goes for the four teams that begin play Saturday.
The winner of each bracket will then play a winner-take-all CWS
championship game June 19.
</P>
<P>
   As Rockwell noted, the committee seeded the invitees before the
64-team NCAA tournament field was announced, and seven of the top
eight seeds made it to the CWS. Oklahoma State's defeat of Baylor
prevented the Omaha field from containing all of the top-seeded
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically are patting ourselves on the back,'' Rockwell
said. ``Any time you can seed at the beginning and get seven of
eight, we think we did a pretty good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell said the feedback resulting from the new 64-team format
has been mostly positive. The only negative has dealt with the fact
that some teams within the same conference had to meet in super
regionals. But with the NCAA's commitment to placing teams in
geographic proximity, it might not be helped, Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some (things to consider), but I don't think there
will be any serious tinkering,'' he said of the regional/super
regional format, which replaced the 48-team tournament that put six
teams in eight regionals. ``I think we have a foundation to improve
college baseball. It proved that all the criteria we used _
including the RPI _ worked. I think it's something that we will
continue to build on for the betterment of college baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee's seedings went against the college baseball
polls. Miami was seeded No. 1 by the NCAA committee and Rice was
seeded No. 8, based on the Ratings Percentage Index. The RPI takes
into account a team's record, opponents and record of opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Before last week, Rice was No. 1 in the Baseball America poll.
The Owls fell to No. 4 this week after losing one of their super
regional games. Rice is No. 1 and Miami No. 2 in the Baseball
Weekly/ESPN poll, which was not updated this week. Miami remained
No. 1 in the Collegiate Baseball poll, with Rice No. 2, as it was
before the super regionals.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said the Owls can compete with anyone in the CWS,
regardless of ranking or RPI, because of their depth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are solid enough and mature enough to have a shot
at anyone we play,'' Graham said. ``What gives me real hope is the
way we competed with the bat this weekend (against Southwestern
Louisiana). We are not going to face pitching that is much tougher
than what we faced this weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one thing Graham would like to rectify.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picked Miami before the season started to win the national
championship,'' he said. ``They've got talent, but they've kind of
had an up-and-down year. I'll have to rethink my position. I think
we have a shot.''

 By BILL SULLIVAN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
DALLAS _ It started with Joe Nieuwendyk. Pretty soon, Dave Reid was
getting into the act. Lately, Jamie Langenbrunner has been testing
the mettle of headline writers, and in Game 7 of the Western
Conference finals, it was Mike Keane who took center stage.
<TEXT>
<P>
   What, you might ask, of Mike Modano, Brett Hull or Jere
Lehtinen, three of Dallas' more celebrated Stars?
</P>
<P>
   They've been busy doing battle with the Peter Forsbergs, Joe
Sakics, Theo Fleurys and Claude Lemieuxs of the NHL world, matchups
in which just breaking even can be bigger than it seems. That, in
turn, has left plenty of room for other Stars to shine in these
playoffs, and none has taken better advantage of the situation than
Nieuwendyk, Reid and Langenbrunner, a second line that is putting
up statistics worthy of a No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been a plus for our team all year,'' said winger Pat
Verbeek as the Stars got ready for Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Finals
at 7 tonight at Reunion Arena. ``We really rely on our depth, and
we count on other people to score.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``other people'' have done just that, which is a major
reason Dallas is just four wins away from claiming hockey's most
coveted prize.
</P>
<P>
   Through 17 postseason games, Nieuwendyk has nine goals
(including a pair of game-winners in the Colorado series) and nine
assists. After watching most of the fun from the stands when he
suffered a severe knee injury in the opening playoff game against
San Jose a year ago, the 32-year-old center has been an enormous
part of Dallas' Stanley Cup run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Missing out last year really hurt him and in the end hurt the
team because the depth was missing,'' Modano said. ``He's made up
for lost time.''
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old Reid has managed his time pretty well, too. He
may have totaled just 17 points (six goals) in 73 regular-season
games, but eight points in 17 playoff outings have elevated his
profile considerably.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it is in the playoffs,'' Reid said. ``The top
lines are going to wash each other out. It's important for
everybody else to contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner, who won't turn 24 until next month, clearly got
the memo as well. Following a disappointing regular season in which
he scored only 12 times (in addition to 33 assists), he took over
Game 6 in Colorado with a pair of goals, then opened the scoring in
the decisive Game 7 on a picture-perfect feed from Nieuwendyk.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Langenbrunner has nine postseason goals, three of them
game-winners. And all this comes from a fellow who lit the lamp
only once in last year's playoffs, that one coming on something of
a fluke as a long slap shot was badly misplayed by Detroit's Chris
Osgood.
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner realizes his work is hardly done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our line is going to be expected to contribute because of the
guys who check Mike's line,'' Langenbrunner said. ``We're going to
have to pick up the pace again.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Stars will be trying to pick up Peca, as in
Michael, the Buffalo star who likely will occupy much of Modano's
time. If Dallas can play the Sabres' top line to a draw, the hope
is that superior depth will favor the Stars as the series
progresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to see,'' said Modano. ``It takes some of the heat
off us.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Colorado, those other lines helped wear out three-time
Stanley Cup-winning goalie Patrick Roy. Dallas now tries to find a
crack or two in the wall that is Dominik Hasek, the Buffalo goalie
who is allowing just 1.82 goals per outing in these playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is to outwork him,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said.
``If you let a goalie discourage you, that's when you're in
trouble. You've got to outwork him.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Cup finally in sight, Dallas hopes to do just that.
Hitchcock would be perfectly happy to see a Modano or a Hull catch
fire and make these Finals his own, but more likely the heroics
will come from elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the search began as the Stars and Sabres met the press
in the Star Club, adjacent to Reunion Arena. While the usual
suspects drew the customary attention, the Nieuwendyks, Keanes,
Langenbrunners and Brian Skrudlands found themselves surrounded by
tape recorders and minicams as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about the playoffs is that anyone can step up,''
said Keane. ``It seems like every night, there's a new hero.''
</P>
<P>
   The Strs look for four more to answer the call. At this point,
they aren't particular about whom they might be.

DONATIONS FOR L.A. CHARTER REFORM MEASURE HIT FRENZIED PACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: Adding details) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The battle over reform of Los Angeles city
government climaxed Monday in a barrage of mailers, TV ads and more
controversy over funding of campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   City Council members who spearheaded the fight against charter
reform with public employee unions attacked a late $50,000
contribution from the Los Angeles Times' parent corporation, Times
Mirror Co., to Yes on Measure 1 _ the ballot issue to be decided by
voters today.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism erupted even as Council President John Ferraro was
donating a second $50,000 from his officeholder account, which was
funded by political contributors, and Councilwoman Ruth Galanter
was giving $10,000 from hers to the opponents of charter reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a problem when a newspaper gets involved
because it makes you wonder if it affects the reporting of the
issue,'' said Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg. ``You wonder. Reporters
aren't allowed to get involved, but publishers are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the inimitable words of Samuel Clemens, you will have the
best government that money can buy,'' Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Times spokesman David Garcia said the criticism was misplaced
since the donation came from the corporate entity and not the
newspaper directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``One is the newspaper, the other is the corporate entity,''
Garcia said. ``And it has no impact on the news coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times and Times Mirror are located in the same building in
downtown L.A. Records indicate the Times Mirror contribution was
made Thursday, the same day Times Mirror Chairman and CEO Mark
Willes relinquished the role of publisher of the Times to
concentrate on corporate matters.
</P>
<P>
   The Times has strongly endorsed charter reform and previously
criticized the Daily News for giving $60,000 last year to the San
Fernando Valley petition drive to get a formal study of cityhood,
an issue that will only go before voters if the county Local Agency
Formation Commission orders a ballot measure. The Times has
strongly opposed possible secession by the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In a front-page article on charter reform Sunday, the Times
identified a number of major contributors to the campaign,
including the Los Angeles Business Advisors, identifying Willes as
a member of the group of chief executive officers. The article did
not mention the $50,000 contribution made Thursday by Times Mirror.
</P>
<P>
   The latest list of contributions showed a $100,000 donation was
made by Mayor Richard Riordan, who has organized an estimated $1.5
million effort to win passage of a new charter to replace the
city's 75-year-old constitution that has been amended nearly 400
times.
</P>
<P>
   Also joining Riordan in backing the proposal was Michael Milken
and the Petersen Properties, each giving $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor has been a longtime supporter of charter reform and
he's putting his money where his mouth is,'' said Deputy Mayor
Noelia Rodriguez, who is on a leave during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, it's not the money that should be the issue, but the
issue of charter reform and the future of Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Disclosure last week of a $200,000 contribution from media and
entertainment mogul Rupert Murdoch, who owns Fox television and
20th Century Fox among many other properties, sparked fiery attacks
from council members, but the reaction to the Times Mirror
contribution was more subdued.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original charter was reformed because big business tried
to control it,'' Councilman Mike Hernandez said. ``Riordan wasn't
around, but the L.A. Times was.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my perspective it's not going to change the reality that
around the kitchen table, people aren't talking about charter
reform. And the reality is that ... very few people will be
deciding the constitution to our city. I don't think those are
people who can be bought.''
</P>

campaigns, expected to be updated today, are available on the

SPORTS COLUMN: THE SWINGMAN COMES OUT OF THE DOGHOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Larry Bird was surrounded by reporters on Monday
morning. The buzz of the day was that Jeff Van Gundy, the Knicks'
head coach, had scrapped a monthlong winning formula and elevated
Latrell Sprewell to the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   How would Bird counter? Would Bird counter at all?
</P>
<P>
   Larry Legend wasn't budging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get into playing matchups with Jeff Van
Gundy,'' he said with just a hint of disdain. ``I don't want to get
into this chess match where if he makes a move, I've got to make a
move.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the move that Bird was forced to make may have
saved the day _ and the series _ for the Pacers. Earlier in the
morning, Bird learned that Travis Best, the backup point guard,
would miss Monday night's Game 4 at Madison Square Garden with a
pulled groin muscle. Suddenly, Bird, one of the great clutch
players of all time, had to put his faith and Pacer dreams on the
shoulders of Jalen Rose, the 6-foot-8-inch guard/forward who has
been in and out of Bird's doghouse this season. He is out now.
</P>
<P>
   Bird is wise enough to know that Rose is also the Pacers' most
versatile player in a series where versatility has become a
premium. So with 4 minutes 37 seconds left in the first quarter,
Reggie Miller disappearing _ once again _ Rose went in for Miller.
The spirit changed immediately. Rose hit a running jumper over
Allan Houston and then a tough twisting jumper over Houston, then
made a tough, in-your-face jumper over Houston at the buzzer. Not
only did Rose play the point but _ at various times in the half _
he also defended Marcus Camby, Houston and Latrell Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   Rose ended the half with 10 points and 4 rebounds. More than any
statistics could show, Rose and Chris Mullin steadied the reeling
Pacers, refocused his team on the prize and inched closer to
securing Bird's trust.
</P>
<P>
   Rose finished with a team-high 19 points, and his 12th and 14th
were daggers. After Kurt Thomas pulled the Knicks within 69-62,
Rose hit a jumper for the left corner that silenced the crowd. Then
Camby brought the house down with a thundering dunk, Rose working
against Larry Johnson, a nasty jumper that that gave Indiana a
73-64 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Rose wasn't finished. After Chris Childs pulled the Knicks
within 76-68, Rose, now handling the point duties, drove then
dished out to Miller who scored. The next time down the court, Rose
drove on Houston, scored off the glass and drew the foul. The
3-point play gave the Pacers an 81-70 lead and send fans to the
exits. Indiana would win, 90-78, tying the series at two games
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Trust comes a lot faster when a team's back is against the wall.
For the last three games, Rose has battled Sprewell and done what
few have been able to do: he forced turnovers, blocked shots and
generally made his good friend trip over himself.
</P>
<P>
   Rose and Sprewell became friends in 1993. They met when Chris
Webber, Rose's teammate at Michigan, was drafted by Golden State.
Sprewell had joined the Warriors a year earlier. ``I was out there
that whole summer working out with the team with Chris Mullin years
ago, so we've been friends since then,'' he recalled. Rose followed
Sprewell's career and the now fabled incident at Golden State when
he choked his coach, P.J. Carlesimo.
</P>
<P>
   Rose had his own problems with Larry Brown, then his coach at
Indiana. While the problems didn't lead to a physical
confrontation, they left Rose with the hard-to-clean ``attitude
problem'' label. While Sprewell played with ferocious abandon and
ultimately forced the coaching staff to put him in the starting
lineup, Rose has taken a more moderate approach to proving himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect Latrell's drive, but I'm in a little different
position than he is,'' Rose said. ``I knew coming into the season
that we were going to do the same thing this season that we did
last season. Regardless of how I felt about it, regardless of any
improvement to my game or our team, I was prepared to deal with the
circumstances that way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't come in thinking that, regardless, I may find a way
to get them to change how they're doing things. I knew coming in
that was not going to happen. I'm going to go out and play my butt
off every night and whether it's for 20 minutes or for 48 minutes,
whatever they asked me to do, I made up my mind, coming into this
season, I was going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose was now walking to the Pacers' bus and saying how happy he
was for Sprewell's success. Later that night he would compete
furiously against his friend. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rose said there was something neat about the way New York has
generally embraced Sprewell. For Rose, the embrace says something,
not simply about people liking a winner, but about the deeper
nature of the city that appreciates toughness, persistence and
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's about opportunity,'' he said. ``New York is like
Paris, a city where everybody's doing their own thing; it's not
revolving around one person or one place. This is a town of
fighters. This is a town where you can be a multimillionaire, but
you walk a mile to work. So they respect a fighter. Latrell comes
here, they see this guy who has a lot of people taking shots at him
and had his back up against the wall. He's shown them that he has
the fortitude.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before he climbed onto the bus Rose added: ``He's taken them to
the Eastern Conference finals. Now they embrace him. Spike Lee had
to take off his Ewing jersey and put on a Sprewell jersey.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, Knick fans had nightmares about No. 5. &QL;

NO WORD ON PARK'S STATUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Dodgers awaited word of right-hander Chan Ho
Park's eminent suspension Monday in vain. Such word never came.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers are anxious to hear from National League
president Leonard Coleman, not only so they'll know Park's status,
but also so they can plan their starting rotation for the next week
or so.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers officials said they're expecting Park to be suspended
for five to seven games. If that's the case, don't expect Park to
appeal the decision, several Dodgers officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule is set up in the favor of the Dodgers to handle the
suspension without a starter needing to pitch on short rest or
without needing to summon Jamie Arnold from the bullpen for a spot
start.
</P>
<P>
   Park's next turn to pitch would be Thursday, which is an off day
for the Dodgers. It would allow lefty Carlos Perez to open the
three-game series in Oakland on his normal four days rest and for
Ismael Valdes and Darren Dreifort to pitch on their regular rest.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also have off Monday, which would give the Dodgers
another round of starts before needing a fifth starter. If a
verdict was handed down today, the Dodgers wouldn't need a fifth
starter until June 19 against Philadelphia. The Dodgers would play
nine games by then.
</P>
<P>
   Park faces the suspension after getting into a fight with the
Angels' Tim Belcher on Saturday. After being tagged out by Belcher
along the first-base line, Park hit Belcher with a forearm to the
face and then bashed a charging Belcher with a flying scissors-kick
before the benches emptied.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley OK: Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley said he's ready to
return from the wrist sprain that's forced him to miss the last
four games. He took batting practice before Monday's game and
didn't experiences any discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hundley is aware of manager Davey Johnson's style and
wouldn't be surprised if he was given today off.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're ready to go, he gives you one more day,'' Hundley
said. ``I can handle it. I'm learning to go with the flow, to
relax.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley sprained his left wrist Wednesday in Pittsburgh in a
collision at home plate. But the Dodgers throw Dreifort tonight
against the Texas Rangers, and the movement of his pitches figures
into Johnson's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``He caught Perez's warm-ups (Sunday),'' Johnson said, ``but
that's not quite like catching Dreifort.''
</P>
<P>
   Draft signings: The Dodgers signed 11 of their 50 picks from
last week's amateur draft, including three of their top 10 and
seven of their first 15.
</P>
<P>
   Top pick Jason Repko, a shortstop from Hanford High in West
Richland, Wash., signed during the weekend. It included a $700,000
signing bonus. He was the 37th pick overall and will arrive in Vero
Beach, Fla., today for minicamp before heading to Great Falls
(Mont.) for rookie ball in the Pioneer League.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' fourth pick, shortstop Joe Thurston of Sacramento
City College, and their ninth pick, right-handed Jonathan Berry of
Newberry College, also signed.
</P>
<P>
   Short hops: During the weekend series with Anaheim, Johnson
returned to using Eric Young in the leadoff spot in place of Devon
White. The eight-game experiment of hitting Young second is over
for now. ``(Young) is the sparkplug,'' Johnson said. ``He's been
struggling a little bit, but it's what happens in this game. He's
our best leadoff guy, head and shoulders. Devo, it was a little
more strain on him to lead off. He's a little more comfortable down
in the lineup.''... Johnson was hired Oct. 23 to manage the
Dodgers, and at a get-together after Sunday's game he met Rupert
Murdoch, chairman and CEO of The News Corporation, the parent
company of the Fox Group, which owns the Dodgers.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ So now that the Knicks have surrendered the
home-court advantage they worked so hard to get, the only logical
assumption is that they have the Indiana Pacers right where they
want them: thinking they are going back home, in the clear.
</P>
<P>
   That's been the essence of this crazy, shortened season, hasn't
it? The Knicks making everyone believe they are about to go away,
and then reappearing, like Marcus Camby, flying from nowhere,
making people change their shot and next week's plans.
</P>
<P>
   That is what the pro basketball playoffs are about in a larger
sense, staying loose and flexible. Rethinking. Remapping.
Re-energizing, which is what the Pacers did on Monday night,
bumping and grinding their way back into the Eastern Conference
final with a 90-78 victory at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers knew they were one defeat from the unofficial
countdown to a New York-San Antonio championship series, and they
played with that kind of desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Mullin played like it was 1985, any old St. John's game on
the same Garden floor, finding too many seams in the Knicks'
defense. Reggie Miller didn't terrorize Spike Lee, or anyone else,
but he mustered enough second-half offense after an embarrassing
scoreless first half. Most of all the Pacers, as promised, made the
lane a far less friendly place.
</P>
<P>
   But come on. Boos for the Knicks as they walked off the floor
trailing by 45-32 at the half? Saturday night may as well have been
1973. It was so quickly forgotten that no rational soul in the area
had the remote notion one month ago that the Knicks might make the
finals. And contingencies are still being made.
</P>
<P>
   My friend, Michelle Musler, planned a lot of business for the
last two weeks of June and is scrambling around in the event her
presence in the first row behind the Knicks' bench is required.
Many news media outlets in the area are busily rearranging their
travel budgets. As for me, I've been looking forward to the
second-week matchups on the Wimbledon lawn, but what the heck, the
San Antonio Riverwalk is lovely and the burritos taste better than
strawberries and cream.
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose this series, Camby, more than anyone, has become the
embodiment of the Knicks' evolution. The elasticity of his body,
the dancer's lightness with which he moves, gives the Knicks a
chance in this series as they depart for Indianapolis and Game 5 on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Grunfeld said he made the Charles Oakley trade to better
meet the athleticism of Indiana's Davises, Antonio and Dale. By
now, you know the whole convoluted saga, and even Dave Checketts
will have to admit soon that Grunfeld was right.
</P>
<P>
   After looking golden most of the season, it is Glen Grunwald,
not Grunfeld, who has to explain why the tall, young acrobat he
gave up on in Toronto is eliciting praises such as ``dominant'' and
``outstanding'' from Jeff Van Gundy, the coach who didn't want him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marcus was always a great talent,'' Grunwald, the Raptors'
general manager, said by telephone on Monday. ``His problems were
injuries and consistency. We needed veteran leadership, and that's
what we got. Marcus needed a chance to play in an environment that
would bring the best out in him. New York's a pressure cooker. You
burn up or turn into a diamond.''
</P>
<P>
   Toughened by a short season in our pro sports cauldron, Camby is
glistening in the national spotlight. But Grunwald said, ``I don't
regret the trade at all.''
</P>
<P>
   What else could he say? News media opinions are like a coach's
cliches, plentiful and disposable, but these men have careers on
the line. For the deposed Grunfeld, there is bitter irony in
Camby's becoming a major player in the 180-degree turnaround that
has saved Van Gundy. To put it in basketball terminology, Checketts
was in the process of taking a shot at Phil Jackson, but Camby
appeared from the weak side to swat it away.
</P>
<P>
   Camby was supposed to be in big trouble on Monday night, as
Larry Bird said the big, bad Davis boys were going to plant some
serious elbows in in his scrawny chest. Well, Camby wasn't the
dominant player he was Saturday night, but he didn't exactly run
for the exit, either. His hustle, in fact, got the Knicks and crowd
out of a third-quarter stupor, impassioned for the fourth. Not
enough shots fell this time.
</P>
<P>
   Please, though, no boos. The Knicks are not out of this, by any
means. They have won twice in Miami this playoff season, twice in
Atlanta. This has the look, smell and feel of seven games. Just
when you think these Knicks are done, they come back. Wingspan
travels. &QL;

BELCHER STILL ANGRY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Pitcher Tim Belcher spoke to reporters Monday
for the first time since his fight Saturday with Dodgers pitcher
Chan Ho Park, who attempted a flying kick at Belcher, spikes and
all.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher was still angry over the incident, and didn't think the
explanation that tae kwon do _ a form of martial arts _ is commonly
taught in Park's native Korea was a good excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy knows tae kwon do. So what?'' Belcher said. ``I like
to hunt, but I didn't take a shotgun. There's a time and place for
everything. If you get rolled by a thug on the street, and he tries
to steal your kid and beat your wife, whip out everything you've
got.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain unwritten rules on the baseball field that
he doesn't understand _ and he should. There are cultural
differences, and he might have that as a legitimate excuse. But if
he can be taught the language, he can be taught the customs.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher didn't talk about the incident Saturday or Sunday,
instead issuing a statement both days, because ``it makes better
sense to let something like that calm down.''
</P>
<P>
   Rotation update: Although manager Terry Collins said before the
game he had not made a final decision, Belcher said he'd be able to
pitch Wednesday on three days rest.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday is Omar Olivares' turn in the rotation, but he won't
be able to go because of a strained left hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher, who made only 81 pitches Saturday, said he doesn't need
to be held to a limited pitch count.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't tell Terry I could go Wednesday if I wasn't going
to approach it like a normal start,'' Belcher said.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus honored: Third baseman Troy Glaus was named American
League co-Player of the Week (with the White Sox's Frank Thomas)
for the week of May 31-June 6.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus had a league-high 22 total bases and hit .550 (11 for 20)
with three homers, two doubles and six RBI in six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the key for me is to keep it simple,'' said Glaus, who
entered Monday's game hitting .258 with nine homers and 27 RBI.
``Just hit it and don't worry about where it goes. Put a nice pass
on it and whatever happens, happens. It's a matter of putting your
work in and knowing your swing is going to come around.''
</P>
<P>
   Also: Right fielder Todd Greene had to leave Monday's game in
the second inning with tightness in his right hamstring. Greene
doubled in the top of the second before being replaced by Orlando
Palmeiro in the bottom of the inning.... Ex-Angel J.T. Snow wasn't
in the Giants' starting lineup because the Angels threw lefty Chuck
Finley. Snow, formerly a switch hitter, bats only left-handed now
because he struggled hitting right-handed. Snow, though, has been
successful against the Angels in interleague play the past two
seasons, hitting .379 (11 for 29) with five homers and 12 RBI.

THIS SHOULDN'T BE UPSETTING TO NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
 BKN-RYAN COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Want to hear something ridiculous? The Knicks were
booed off the floor at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   OK, they were pretty bad in the first 24 minutes. They were down
by 13 at the half (45-32) and their offense was your basic chicken
excrement. But boos? After what this team has done for the fans and
the city in the past three weeks?
</P>
<P>
   We can really be a bad race of people sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   The problem very likely is that the New York Knicks are now
burdened by absurdly unrealistic expectations. They arrived at
Monday night's Game 4 with the Pacers thanks, frankly, to some very
nice breaks. Does Allan Houston and Miami ring a bell? Does drawing
the pathetically impotent Atlanta Hawks in the next round ring a
bell? Does Larry Johnson making two gimme-a-break 3-pointers
earlier in the game and then getting an NBA-only ``continuation''
call to augment a 3-pointer at the end of Game 3 ring a bell?
</P>
<P>
   So what's the point? The point is that the Knicks are what the
Knicks are, which is a highly flawed team now playing without its
inspirational 7-foot leader. What the Knicks have done to get this
far is very laudable. Anything they do beyond this is gravy, icing,
you name it. Extra. A bonus. Unnerstan?
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks lost a 90-78 decision to the Pacers Monday night, and
in so doing they looked very bad. Perhaps I'm just an outside
cynic, but should anyone be surprised? Did anyone halfway
intelligent really think the Knicks were some wonder team?
</P>
<P>
   The flip side is that the Pacers have got to be ecstatic heading
back home. They pulled even in the series after what could have
been a devastating loss Saturday. They could have pulled a Portland
and allowed one big play to ruin their season. They did not. Even
better, they won this big road game despite receiving a minimal
offensive contribution from Reggie Miller and a negligible
all-around contribution from Rik Smits. Want more? OK, they
rediscovered a valuable sixth man in Jalen Rose (19 points) and
welcomed back an offensive MIA in the person of Chris Mullin, who
scored 18 points in the first three games and 18 in the first 31
minutes of Monday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really ready for a breakout game,'' smiled Mullin, who
has struggled in each of the last two playoffs when being
agressively guarded by younger, quicker athletes, which is to say
just about any conceivable opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked extremely hard to get open tonight, and we didn't
guard him,'' said a very unhappy Jeff Van Gundy. ``It was a
combination.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullin hurt the Knicks early with some cuts and slashes to the
hoop and he really knifed them in the third quarter with both
outside shooting and an ability to find his way to the free throw
line. All this represented a completely new dimension for Larry
Bird, who has been running the proud Mullin out there for two
playoff seasons hoping to get at least one such game out of his
ancient warrior. If Monday night turns out to be the only Mullin
moment, so be it. The Pacers had to have this game, and they
wouldn't have nailed it down without Mullin.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy had drawn pregame attention with a significant
coaching decision. He let the world know Sunday that he would
replace Kurt Thomas in the starting lineup with Latrell Sprewell,
over whom the New York press and basketball-loving public have been
salivating of late. It has become rather chic in New York to refer
to Sprewell as ``the best player on the team,'' and so, as if
yielding to public opinion, Van Gundy gave in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was talking about Sprewell starting,'' pointed out
Bird. ``It was a big burden on Chris's shoulders, and that is a
tough matchup for him. But we thought if Chris could get free at
the other end and loosen up, he might score, and that's what he
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird was all over the newspapers the day before this game,
calling on Miller to step it up and wondering aloud just how much
his team would be affected by the surreal ending of Game 3. The
Johnson shot even took place a few feet from where Larry himself
was standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little suprised how we played tonight,'' Bird
acknowledged. ``We really took a hit the other night. But after we
practiced on Sunday, I could see we were loosened up, and we really
came in here and played well tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bird lavished praise on his troops, Van Gundy blasted his
boys for atrocious defense and rebounding. They weren't as bad as
Van Gundy suggested, of course, but to say otherwise would be to
admit just how marginal his team is.
</P>
<P>
   Let's get it straight. The Knicks have been on a roll, but no
one should confuse that spurt with greatness. They might just be
like Charismatic. We may have already seen all they've got to give.

STUDENT, 15, GOES THE EXTRA MILE FOR SCHOLARSHIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ROBERT MONROE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Lynisha Perkins watches the sun rise and set every
day through the windows of a school bus that crawls 90 minutes each
way along a route between her home in South Central Los Angeles and
Granada Hills High School.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-year-old said she is willing to go so many extra miles to
get the education she wants.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, she was rewarded for her tenacity: Lynisha and five
other Los Angeles Unified students each received a $16,000 college
scholarship from former Secretary of State Warren Christopher and
his Los Angeles law firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assumed that they were only going for the best and the
brightest, and I never thought of myself like that,'' she said.
``Maybe now that everybody's saying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher said he was struck by the story of the long bus
ride, her life in a single-parent household and Lynisha's poise and
self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I met her, I felt very much reassured that we had made a
sound choice,'' said Christopher, who has returned to the
sponsoring law firm, O'Melveny and Myers, as the senior partner.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th-grader with a 3.7 grade-point average received a plaque
Monday and will get the $16,000 scholarship when she finishes high
school.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the 50 high schools in the Los Angeles Unified School
District nominated one candidate. Christopher, a committee of law
firm members, district representatives and the California Community
Foundation selected the six winners. The other nominees get $500
each.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher said the law firm chose to award the scholarship six
years ago to recognize students in the firm's base city.
Christopher himself is a graduate of Hollywood High School. The
firm also wanted to focus the winners early _ they are all
10th-grade students _ on the goals they can achieve with the
financial help.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so many tragic situations where students drop out of
high school, having been discouraged by their prospects,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher added that no recipient has failed to finish high
school, though the firm will get the students mentors if they
falter.
</P>
<P>
   According to her teachers, Lynisha isn't likely to buck
tradition. Pat Givant, coordinator of the Granada Hills/California
State University, Northridge, Math Science and Technology Program,
said Lynisha is a strong candidate for a program allowing her to
take classes at CSUN. Givant said there are lots of students who
take the bus to get to the magnet program, but that Lynisha has an
extra quality that made her stand out.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's going in that direction where she's not only willing to
be challenged here but taking whatever's available to her,'' Givant
said. ``Usually when you get a student who gets involved right
away, you know you have someone who is motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynisha had already chosen the San Fernando Valley as a place to
go to school as a middle school student. She followed her brother
Maurice, now 18, to a magnet program at Nobel Middle School in
Northridge. She saw going to Granada Hills, with its magnet program
and the friends she had made, as a no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The schools out where I lived weren't all that great,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Perkins, Lynisha's mother, said Granada Hills also had
the music program her daughter, a piccolo and flute player, was
looking for. When Lynisha gets home at dusk from school, she is
coming from the band room where she spends three hours after class.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Perkins said she has never had to play the role of
motivator even though the day starts at 5:30 a.m. It's occasionally
a hurdle for the mother, who is part-time taxi driver to her
daughter on especially late nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult with her getting up early and with her getting
up early, her mom is getting up early,'' Deborah Perkins said.
``She has high standards, and she has set goals for herself, and
she's very focused.''
</P>
<P>
   In Lynisha's college plans, Stanford has yielded to the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology as her first choice. What's
important to her and her mother is not the place but the
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that she's exposed to as many positive
experiences as possible,'' Deborah Perkins said. ``I guess she can
get used to the cold.''

KIDS AND TEENS TAKE TO INTERNET SHOPPING

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As if parents don't have enough to worry about
when it comes to the Internet, a new study reported Monday that
online marketers are increasingly targeting youths as a back door
to mom and dad's pocketbook.
</P>
<P>
   According to the study by the Internet research firm Jupiter
Communications, teens and children ages 5 to 12 are the
fastest-growing segment of online users. And by 2002, Jupiter
projects, they'll be spending more than $1.3 billion per year in
online transactions, 10 times current levels.
</P>
<P>
   To get their hands on all that extra cash, marketers of
everything from toys to video games to clothing are going after
young people at sites youngsters visit most. And youths, in turn,
are coming to adults for money to buy all the goodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of grabbing parents' coat sleeves, today's digital
kids ask ... for credit card numbers in place of an allowance and
buy products online,'' said Anya Sacharow, an analyst with
Jupiter's Consumer Content Strategies division.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, parents are uneasy with the phenomenon.
Jupiter's study found 45 percent of parents surveyed said they were
concerned about online advertising aimed at young people, compared
to just 17 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Butterworth, a Los Angeles psychologist who specializes
in teens and culture, said the Jupiter results should come as no
surprise to anyone who has watched the blossoming of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure is on,'' Butterworth said. ``E-commerce has
trickled down to kids, and they're being pushed to spend money
online.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes youths especially attractive to marketers is their
comfort with the Internet, Butterworth said. ``To all these kids
it's second nature. The fact that you're putting your credit card
number out there doesn't bother them at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jupiter study found that 67 percent of online teens and 37
percent of online kids have researched or bought goods online,
proving that today's youths ``see the Internet as a preferred tool
for information gathering,'' Sacharow said. ``Commerce is a natural
progression.''
</P>
<P>
   But youths and online shopping do not mix, as witnessed last
month when a New Jersey eighth-grader bid nearly $3 million on
Internet auction site eBay.com for items ranging from a Van Gogh
painting to a 1955 red Ford convertible.
</P>
<P>
   While extreme, the case shows the disconnect that can exist
between young people and money, industry observers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way it's like magic money for them,'' said Andrew De
Vries, director of marketing for Wired Digital, and producer of
Webmonkey for Kids, a youth-oriented Internet site. ``Because they
can't see (the money) or feel it, everything seems less expensive
to them.''
</P>
<P>
   In its report, Jupiter recommends online marketers show care in
how they go after youths and their discretionary dollars. Sacharow
said e-commerce sites should create transactional experiences that
teach fiscal responsibility, the value of money and how to evaluate
products.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, she said, ``Online players ... risk alienating
parents, creating a negative brand image and fostering greedy
customers.''

MULLINS ANSWERS THE CALL IN STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He was supposed to be too old and too slow, a relic
of a player who could give the Indiana Pacers nothing against the
high-rising, fleet-footed New York Knicks. A 35-year-old former
Olympic Dream Team member and five-time All-Star, Chris Mullin was
said to have little value in this series. Why, some observers
wondered, did Coach Larry Bird continue to start him?
</P>
<P>
   Mullin, still moving as if his sneakers had glue on their soles,
answered that question on Monday night, scoring 18 points to lead
Indiana to a 90-78 victory over the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Schooling the sleeker Latrell Sprewell in the craft of spin
moves and head fakes, Mullin kept the Pacers from falling into an
abyss on a night when their two top guns, Reggie Miller and Rik
Smits, played more like 12th men.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and Smits, the Pacers' two leading scorers, totaled 16
points, 14 below their combined average of 30 points in the first
three games of this series. They went scoreless in the first half,
as Smits played only a minute _ and not because of foul trouble _
and Miller missed all three of his field goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with Antonio Davis (12 points), Jalen Rose (10) and
Mullin (8) picking up the slack, Indiana took a 45-32 lead into the
locker room.
</P>
<P>
   The third quarter belonged to Mullin, who reminded Madison
Square Garden's fans how he used to play when he was a star at St.
John's. Hitting 3 of 5 shots and three free throws, he scored 10
points in a four-minute span that pushed Indiana's 47-38 lead to
60-46 midway through the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Mullin scored 7 straight points for the Pacers.
After Miller followed a Mullin 3-pointer with a 3-pointer of his
own _ it was Miller's first basket of the game _ Mullin sank a
20-footer, drew a foul on Charlie Ward while attempting a
3-pointer, hit the three foul shots and then spun around Sprewell
for a driving layup. He had all his points by the end of the third
quarter, when the Pacers led, 66-57.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin was one of the least likely players to even this series
at two games apiece and return the home-court advantage to Indiana.
He had been no factor in the first three games, averaging 6 points
on woeful 37.5 percent shooting. Mullin had been so bad that Bird
was playing him just 18 minutes a game. A defensive liability no
matter who he guarded, Mullin was expected to see his impact lessen
as the series went on.
</P>
<P>
   Game 4 was going to be Miller's revival, his return from the odd
comatose state he had been in for most of this series. Even if his
lauded jump shot was not falling, Miller was going to be different
from the deferring, disengaged player he had been for the better
part of this matchup with the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Bird had challenged him to be more aggressive, even selfish,
demanding that Miller display the superstar qualities he is reputed
to have. Miller himself had promised to enter the game in attack
mode, vowing to be a ball hog and attempt as many as 25 shots.
</P>
<P>
   But the loud-talking, pressure-loving Indiana guard backed up
his words about as well as he created his own shot. Rather than
light up the Knicks and the Garden crowd, Miller played his most
unproductive game of this post-season, finishing with 12 points on
3-of-10 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Making good on his promise to carry aggression into the game,
Miller got a little too wild. His first jump shot bounced high off
the rim and over the backboard and he committed his second foul
less than five minutes into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Bird wanted desperately to get his best player going, though, so
he left Miller on the floor. But three minutes and another Miller
miss later, Bird substituted Rose for Miller. The score was tied at
10 and the Pacers were presumably in for a long night. But Rose did
what Miller could not.
</P>
<P>
   He beat Knicks defenders off the dribble and ignited the Pacers,
scoring 6 points in the final 2 minutes 46 seconds of the first
quarter as Indiana surged to take a 23-20 lead into the second.
With Miller on the bench in his warm-ups, the Pacers' roll
continued as Davis, Rose and Mullin did what Miller and Smits could
not in the first half. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Miller finally broke out a bit in the second half, however. He
scored 5 points in the third quarter and another 7 in the fourth
quarter as the Pacers evened the series.

SPORTS COLUMN: SPREEWELL GETS A START BUT DOESN'T PRODUCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He was blazing downcourt, ahead of everyone, trying
to get Chris Childs' attention before the series was tied, the
home-court advantage lost and the questions began all over again.
Cutting along the baseline, behind the Indiana defense, Latrell
Sprewell finally saw the ball headed in his direction.
</P>
<P>
   Inches from the basket and without a moment to spare, he caught
a bullet pass, and fumbled it before he could ever get a shot. Two
Pacers recovered in time to knock the ball out of bounds, but it
was yet another blown opportunity for Sprewell, heavenly sixth man,
hellish starter.
</P>
<P>
   The idea seemed as necessary as it was simple: insert the most
talented offensive player on the team into a starting lineup sorely
in need of points. The sixth man would get his wish, the coach
would get the production he wanted, and the fans at Madison Square
Garden would get to see more of their favorite new player.
</P>
<P>
   But when the experiment involves the supremely talented and
equally erratic Sprewell, the answers are never that easy. On a
night when the Knicks needed a player to take over Game 4 of the
Eastern Conference finals and put the Indiana Pacers into a deep
rut, Sprewell could not deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell played 33 minutes, finished with 12 points and never
got on track in the open court. His ability to change the tempo was
curtailed by Indiana's transition defense. The rest of Sprewell's
ineffectiveness was taken care of by himself.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell had an abysmal first half, shooting 3 for 11, picking
up two fouls within nine seconds of each other in the first quarter
and accomplishing little to merit his first start in more than two
months. It was not so such the misses but the quality of shots he
was taking. Ten-foot runners off one foot with defenders clinging
to him. Pull-up jumpers over Chris Mullin, who cannot guard
Sprewell when he drives toward the goal.
</P>
<P>
   With less than nine minutes left in the game and the Knicks
trying to crawl back in, Sprewell tried an aggressive spin move and
ended up mowing over Reggie Miller for an offensive foul.
</P>
<P>
   He was not alone in failing to carry the team. Larry Johnson
stood out beyond the 3-point line all night, failing to exploit the
matchups inside that had served him so well in the first three
games of the series. Allan Houston, who did not give Sprewell any
help in Game 3, gave him even less in Game 4 with 14 points on
5-of-16 shooting. And let's not even get into the lackluster play
of the point guards.
</P>
<P>
   For all those reasons, Sprewell needed to demonstrate that he
was the first and best option in Patrick Ewing's absence, a player
who could perform under pressure without having to come off the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to take Sprewell's performance and turn into a
referendum on his gradual adjustment in New York. But it was one
game, and being the guinea pig in so many situations this season,
he gets a pass over the short haul. But this was his wish. To
start.
</P>
<P>
   When Jeff Van Gundy began telling his bosses last year that
acquiring Sprewell was worth the risk, he drew distinct parallels
with a young and spry John Starks. The athleticism, the ability to
score in bunches, the raw, unbridled passion. And, of course, a
knack for slowly driving mad anyone for whom they played.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching Starks took Van Gundy most of three seasons, and even
then the coach was unsure what his most unpredictable player would
do in crucial situations. Reaching Sprewell, figuring out what
makes him tick on the floor, is a drawn-out process as well.
</P>
<P>
   All the cold stares from the bench toward Van Gundy, all the
times he honestly _ and petulantly _ answered, ``Jeff knows I want
to start'' were nearly forgotten before the game.
</P>
<P>
   There would be no bickering this night. The most headstrong
offensive player in the National Basketball Association _ Sprewell
goes to the right harder than Jesse Helms _ and the equally
stubborn coach would coexist in their own little playoff world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe he may have had a problem with me, but I have
no problem with him,'' Van Gundy had said. ``That's the bottom
line. I always told him I was doing what was best for the team. He
said he wants to start, but there's been no problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Sprewell: ``I think I just like starting; that's what I
feel comfortable doing. We'll see how I perform. That's one thing I
get up for. In a way, it's like I come out ready and focus and I'm
bringing all the energy from the start.''
</P>
<P>
   It never happened. Another Sprewell experiment had gone awry,
and now the Knicks need to win at least one game in Indianapolis to
advance to their first finals in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy had to make the call. Still, Sprewell looked awfully
good coming off the bench the other night. &QL;

SLEEPWALK EXPERT'S CREDIBILITY ASSAILED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The prosecutor in the Scott Falater murder trial
accused an expert defense witness on Monday of having asked a
technician to falsify the data on tests that measured the sleep of
the former engineer, who claims he was sleepwalking when he stabbed
his wife 44 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were asking (the technician) to falsify or change her
numbers,'' assistant county attorney Juan Martinez said in an
aggressive cross-examination of Janet Tatman, who has endorsed the
sleepwalking defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' came the taut response from Tatman, a
psychologist and sleep disorders specialist who administered four
nights of tests on Falater's sleeping patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining her calm under the prosecutor's barrage, Tatman said
it was he who was distorting the tests. She said he did not
understand the science that was behind her analysis of Falater's
brain waves.
</P>
<P>
   But Tatman acknowledged that the technician had sharply
disagreed with her approach and that ``an air of mistrust''
developed between them. She said the technician had clung
stubbornly to a technique that had been developed 30 years ago and
had been superseded by later sleepwalking research.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be foolish to discount everything that science has
learned,'' said Tatman.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez is expected to revisit the issue next week, when he
calls the technician to testify as he rebuts the defense case. But
in the meantime, internationally renowned sleepwalking expert Dr.
Roger Broughton began his defense testimony on Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Lead defense attorney Michael Kimerer asked the Canadian
physician and researcher the core question of the defense case,
which is based on case law that says no one is criminally
responsible for an act he committed involuntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Did Broughton believe Falater was sleepwalking when he attacked
his wife in January 1997?
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion he was,'' said Broughton, who directs a sleep
disorders center in Ottawa. He has written in medical journals
about his research on violence by sleepwalkers.
</P>
<P>
   The balding, silver-bearded and bespectacled Broughton said his
appearance in the Falater case was only the second time he had
testified in a defense case based on sleepwalking.
</P>
<P>
   His only other testimony came in a 1988 trial of a Canadian man
who was later acquitted of the charge that he had murdered his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   Under Kimerer's questioning, Broughton put on a slide-show
seminar on sleepwalking. He explained that sleepwalking episodes
almost always occur during the first hours of sleep, when the
subject falls into a deep sleep.
</P>
<P>
   That timing is important because Falater's defense claims he had
been working on a defective pump on his backyard pool immediately
before going to bed. Falater slept for about a half hour before
sleepwalking back to the unfinished task, his attorneys say.
</P>
<P>
   Broughton, like Tatman, testified that sleepwalkers often engage
in purposeful activity, particularly related to unfinished tasks.
</P>
<P>
   While the experts helped the defense lay out its case,
prosecutor Martinez used his cross examination of Tatman to narrate
the complex series of events that Falater undertook when he claims
to have been unaware of what he was doing.
</P>
<P>
   Relying mostly on the account of a neighbor who began looking
into the Falater yard after the attack, Martinez said Falater:
stabbed his wife 44 times, stashed his bloody clothes in his Volvo,
put on a pair of gloves, dragged her to the pool, held her head
under water, went inside, put on a bandage and changed into pajamas
and a T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   The complex sequence did not budge Tatman, who endorses the
defense theory that Falater attacked his wife when she came out to
the pool pump to steer him back to bed. Sleepwalkers sometimes
engage in highly complex activities and often lash out at those who
interfere with their movements she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behaviors by themselves don't tell us _ unfortunately _
whether (a sleepwalker) is conscious or not,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of Tatman's testimony, Judge Ronald Reinstein allowed
the jurors to submit written questions for the witness. Asked if
the cold water of the pool would have jolted Falater out of his
sleep, Tatman said research has shown that sleepwalkers' senses are
often dulled.
</P>
<P>
   But Tatman had no ready answer for the juror who wanted to know
how she explained Falater's use of the bandage. ``It may have been
a reflex action to take care of a cut,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tatman said some of Falater's behavior made no logical sense, a
circumstance she called common among sleepwalkers. For example, she
said, rolling his wife, Yarmila, into the pool, where police found
her body floating in crimson waters, ``would seem a pretty
nonsensical thing to do.'' &QL;

HONEYWELL, ALLIEDSIGNAL EMPLOYEES AWAIT MORE DETAILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICCARDO A. DAVIS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The planned merger of AlliedSignal Inc. and Honeywell
Inc. sent shock waves from Wall Street to Minneapolis to Phoenix,
and all points in between.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours after Monday's announcement, about 17,500 Valley
employees working at the two companies were anxiously awaiting
details about the new company _ including how it would reduce
overlapping jobs and shed 4,500 jobs worldwide by the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive officer of the proposed new company
maintained that the cuts would have little impact on the jobs based
in the Valley. Among the reasons: Phoenix is to be the headquarters
for the new company's aerospace division and its largest business
unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combined technological investment we have there represents
$10 billion in revenue,'' said Michael Bonsignore, who is to be
chief executive officer of the new Honeywell. `We are after the
intellect of all the engineers there.''
</P>
<P>
   Decisions about layoffs are not expected to be made until after
the new company does a three-month review of its businesses
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Early Monday, AlliedSignal and Honeywell said they were uniting
to form a $25 billion Fortune 50 company to take advantage of their
complementary aerospace technologies, products and services used on
airplanes. The new company is to retain the name Honeywell, but be
based in AlliedSignal's hometown of Morristown, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Honeywell expects to shed at least 1,000 positions in
Minneapolis when it pulls up stakes and relocates its headquarters
to Morristown.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately half of AlliedSignal's 10,000 employees in Arizona
work in its aerospace business, which manufactures airplane engines
and collision-avoidance systems at its facilities in Phoenix.
AlliedSignal also makes such consumer products as Prestone
antifreeze, Fram auto filters and Autolite spark plugs.
</P>
<P>
   Honeywell, maker of cockpit controls and global positioning
equipment, employs about 7,500 in the Valley. Its businesses are
divided into three segments: Home and Building Control, Industrial
Control and Space and Aviation Control. The latter two are based in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two companies compete on several fronts, their
businesses have little overlap. Robert Johnson, currently president
and chief executive officer of AlliedSignal Aerospace, said there
is no local overlap in the products.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who is to be the new Honeywell's chief operating
officer and executive vice president for aerospace, said
AlliedSignal Aerospace currently cuts metal and makes engines and
jet propulsion devices at its Phoenix facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, adding Honeywell technology, would be able to
produce entire integrated systems, including cockpit systems
consisting of communication, navigation and surveillance equipment
to customers looking to outsource more of the aircraft's systems.
</P>
<P>
   One of the motives behind AlliedSignal's planned acquisition of
Honeywell is that aircraft makers are reducing the number of parts
suppliers they work with, and demanding that those suppliers
provide complete solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Although the new company is to produce integrated cockpits
systems for its customers, the focus of AlliedSignal's Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Lawrence Bossidy will be on integrating the
two corporate cultures. Bossidy will stay on as chairman of the new
company until his planned retirement on April 1, 2000. At that
time, Bonsignore is to assume the additional title and
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Bonsignore said integrating the cultures should be easy because,
despite being somewhat different, they are action-oriented.
</P>
<P>
   Bossidy said, ``We are both successful, growth-driven technology
companies who are intensely focused on performance.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger still requires regulatory approval in Europe and
America, and from stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators are expected to review the merger carefully, but
according to Bonsignore, AlliedSignal and Honeywell only overlap in
two areas: collision avoidance systems and weather radar, which
account for about $250 million in annual sales, or a little more
than 1 percent of the combined business. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ It had been a full game _ nearly two if you piece
together parts of games from other days _ and no incident of injury
or fisticuffs from the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The way it's been going this season, they were due.
</P>
<P>
   So we bring you the outfield situation, already tenuous, tedious
and thin. And then center fielder Devon White leaves with a sore
right leg after the third inning of a 3-2 loss to the Texas Rangers
on Monday at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   White missed seven games with a strained right hamstring in
mid-May, and his availability for the next two games against the
Rangers is in question.
</P>
<P>
   It leaves the Dodgers in a precarious spot once again. Todd
Hollandsworth is on the disabled list with a torn oblique muscle on
his right side, so the club is carrying four outfielders. If White
isn't available, that number gets chopped to three. The way it
worked against Texas was Dave Hansen, upon pinch-hitting in the
eighth, played right field in the ninth and Raul Mondesi moved to
center.
</P>
<P>
   If White is going to miss a few days but not long enough to be
placed the disabled list, it puts the Dodgers in an interesting
situation. Though Johnson has talked about needing a fifth
outfielder, the Dodgers don't have the type Johnson is looking for
_ a left-handed hitting outfielder _ at Triple-A Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   The White conundrum overshadowed the rest of the day for the
Dodgers, the lowlight of which was an inability to hit the usually
ineffective Aaron Sele.
</P>
<P>
   Sele (6-4) had allowed at least four runs in four of his last
six outings. He allowed two runs on five hits in seven-plus innings
against the Dodgers. Rangers closer John Wetteland pitched the
ninth for his major-league-best 20th save.
</P>
<P>
   As it's been most of the season, the Dodgers had the pieces in
place to tie it in the eighth. Eric Young singled to start the
inning and knock Sele out, and Gary Sheffield walked with one out
against Jeff Zimmerman. Mondesi reached on a 10-foot infield single
to load the bases. Eric Karros then lined out to left to score
Young and pull the Dodgers within 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   But Hansen popped out down the right-field line in foul
territory to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the seventh inning the offensively inept Dodgers
got to Sele, and there was help on Texas' part.
</P>
<P>
   Trenidad Hubbard, White's replacement, led off the inning with a
double that popped off center fielder Tom Goodwin's glove near the
wall. Hubbard moved to third on catcher Ivan Rodriguez's errant
pickoff throw to second with none out.
</P>
<P>
   Leading 1-0, Texas played the infield in and Adrian Beltre
grounded to second for the first out. Angel Pena grounded to
shortstop and Hubbard broke for the plate. Instead of trying to get
Hubbard, Texas' Royce Clayton threw to first and allowed Hubbard to
tie the score 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   It mattered for a moment but not much longer. The Rangers
responded with a pair of runs in the eighth inning to ruin what was
turning into a dandy start for Dodgers right-hander Ismael Valdes.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McLemore started the eighth with a leadoff single. Rusty
Greer flied out, Juan Gonzalez walked and Rafael Palmiero singled
to right to score McLemore and give the Rangers a 2-1 lead.
Rodriguez followed with a single to right to score Gonzalez and
make it 3-1 and chase Valdes (5-4) from the game.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Mills relieved and walked Todd Zeile before getting Clayton
to ground into an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Before the eighth, the only Ranger who seemed to have Valdes
figured out was Zeile, the former Dodger. He had three hits and
drove in Texas' first run.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, the reigning AL MVP, led off the second with a single
to right. He moved to second on Ivan Rodriguez's groundout to first
and scored when Zeile hit a ground-rule double to right-center
field to give the Rangers a 1-0 lead.

HONEYWELL, ALLIEDSIGNAL EMPLOYEES AWAIT MORE DETAILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICCARDO A. DAVIS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The planned merger of AlliedSignal Inc. and Honeywell
Inc. sent shock waves from Wall Street to Minneapolis to Phoenix,
and all points in between.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours after Monday's announcement, about 17,500 Valley
employees working at the two companies were anxiously awaiting
details about the new company _ including how it would reduce
overlapping jobs and shed 4,500 jobs worldwide by the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive officer of the proposed new company
maintained that the cuts would have little impact on the jobs based
in the Valley. Among the reasons: Phoenix is to be the headquarters
for the new company's aerospace division and its largest business
unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combined technological investment we have there represents
$10 billion in revenue,'' said Michael Bonsignore, who is to be
chief executive officer of the new Honeywell. `We are after the
intellect of all the engineers there.''
</P>
<P>
   Decisions about layoffs are not expected to be made until after
the new company does a three-month review of its businesses
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Early Monday, AlliedSignal and Honeywell said they were uniting
to form a $25 billion Fortune 50 company to take advantage of their
complementary aerospace technologies, products and services used on
airplanes. The new company is to retain the name Honeywell, but be
based in AlliedSignal's hometown of Morristown, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Honeywell expects to shed at least 1,000 positions in
Minneapolis when it pulls up stakes and relocates its headquarters
to Morristown.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately half of AlliedSignal's 10,000 employees in Arizona
work in its aerospace business, which manufactures airplane engines
and collision-avoidance systems at its facilities in Phoenix.
AlliedSignal also makes such consumer products as Prestone
antifreeze, Fram auto filters and Autolite spark plugs.
</P>
<P>
   Honeywell, maker of cockpit controls and global positioning
equipment, employs about 7,500 in the Valley. Its businesses are
divided into three segments: Home and Building Control, Industrial
Control and Space and Aviation Control. The latter two are based in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two companies compete on several fronts, their
businesses have little overlap. Robert Johnson, currently president
and chief executive officer of AlliedSignal Aerospace, said there
is no local overlap in the products.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who is to be the new Honeywell's chief operating
officer and executive vice president for aerospace, said
AlliedSignal Aerospace currently cuts metal and makes engines and
jet propulsion devices at its Phoenix facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, adding Honeywell technology, would be able to
produce entire integrated systems, including cockpit systems
consisting of communication, navigation and surveillance equipment
to customers looking to outsource more of the aircraft's systems.
</P>
<P>
   One of the motives behind AlliedSignal's planned acquisition of
Honeywell is that aircraft makers are reducing the number of parts
suppliers they work with, and demanding that those suppliers
provide complete solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Although the new company is to produce integrated cockpits
systems for its customers, the focus of AlliedSignal's Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Lawrence Bossidy will be on integrating the
two corporate cultures. Bossidy will stay on as chairman of the new
company until his planned retirement on April 1, 2000. At that
time, Bonsignore is to assume the additional title and
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Bonsignore said integrating the cultures should be easy because,
despite being somewhat different, they are action-oriented.
</P>
<P>
   Bossidy said, ``We are both successful, growth-driven technology
companies who are intensely focused on performance.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger still requires regulatory approval in Europe and
America, and from stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators are expected to review the merger carefully, but
according to Bonsignore, AlliedSignal and Honeywell only overlap in
two areas: collision avoidance systems and weather radar, which
account for about $250 million in annual sales, or a little more
than 1 percent of the combined business. &QL;

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ On the heels of one of the most crushing defeats in
franchise history, the Indiana Pacers came out Monday and crushed
the New York Knicks.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Pacers finally flexed their muscles and hammered the Knicks
90-78 in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals before 19,763 at
Madison Square Garden. The victory evened the best-of-seven series
at 2-2, with Game 5 on Wednesday in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any concern that the Pacers would be flat after the
shocking end to Game 3, when Larry Johnson nailed a four-point play
in the waning seconds to give the Knicks an improbable victory,
Indiana dispelled any such notions right off the bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at Game 3, the emotion can take the steam out of
a team,'' said the Pacers' Reggie Miller, who was held to 12 points
Monday. ``But this team has been there. Maybe not like that
(Johnson's shot), but we've had our backs to the wall many times.
We know what it takes to come back from that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're the better team.''
</P>
<P>
   They certainly appeared to be Monday night, which is why New
Yorkers will no doubt be discussing this game almost as much as
they did the Knicks' miraculous Game 3 win.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   Because New York coach Jeff Van Gundy, apparently thinking his
team needed a shakeup, decided to start sixth man Latrell Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   Up a game and wanting to get a stranglehold in the series, Van
Gundy was hoping Sprewell would put pressure on the Pacers with his
quickness and speed.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, his surprise move served as a wake-up call for the
Pacers, and Van Gundy will no doubt spend the interim answering
questions about his moves.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the decision gave the Knicks a front line that had
6-11 Chris Dudley flanked by 6-7 (wink, wink) Larry Johnson and the
6-5 Sprewell, a frontcourt that rivaled in size those from the
mid-1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Which may be why the Knicks' point total was similar to those of
that era.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you make changes, you're susceptible to
second-guessing,'' Van Gundy said. ``So if it doesn't work, then
some people are going to second-guess you. I don't worry about
that. I know this is the way we have to go to have a chance to win
this series. We're going to stick with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Mullin will be thankful for that.
</P>
<P>
   After struggling in the first three games, averaging six points,
Mullin went off for 18 points. Freed from the burden of guarding
the 6-9 Kurt Thomas, Mullin's matchup against the shorter Sprewell
allowed him to concentrate on offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to take him out,'' Indiana coach Larry Bird said
of Mullin. ``I wanted to leave him in there all night. Chris had a
big burden on his shoulders because he knew Sprewell was going to
start, and everyone was talking about him not being able to defend
Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a tough matchup for Chris, but on the other hand we
feel that if Chris could get loose and hit some shots, then that's
very important for our team. We had to get some scoring out of
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially since they were getting next to nothing from Rik
Smits (four points in 13 minutes) and Miller (3-of-10 shooting),
both of whom were saddled with early foul problems.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Jalen Rose, who ripped the Knicks for a game-high 19
points while delivering several clutch baskets down the stretch.
And with backup point guard Travis Best out with a strained groin,
the 6-8 Rose was inserted at the point and manhandled the shorter
Knicks guards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jalen played extremely well,'' Bird said. ``Jalen loves to
play the point, and he just proved to me that he's capable of doing
that. He had two big baskets in the fourth quarter to kill (New
York) rallies. He just played awesome tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   As did Antonio Davis, who, more than anything else, wanted some
way to make amends for his gaffe that gave the Knicks Game 3. It
was Davis who fouled Johnson on his late 3-pointer, and he wanted
to make up for that mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Davis scored 16 points and grabbed eight rebounds to help ensure
that there would be no last-second heroics in this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just thankful I got an opportunity to play well tonight,''
Davis said. ``It was tough for me after the last game, but I just
wanted a chance to contribute to a win.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it seemed as if the goats were heroes in this one, and
the heroes were goats.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, who appeared to be off-stride from the outset, got
just 11 points (on 5-of-15 shooting) from Johnson and 12 points
from Sprewell. Throw in Allan Houston's meager production (14
points on 5-of-16 shooting), and you can see where the offense
suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Only Marcus Camby (18 points, a game-high 14 rebounds) had
anything even approaching a decent offensive game.
</P>
<P>
   The positive for the Pacers is that they have managed to tie the
series with Miller yet to have a big game. The negative for the
Knicks is that they haven't been able to capitalize while Miller
has struggled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer this series goes, the time is going to come when I
feel better and better,'' said Miller of his offensive woes. ``It's
almost like an overflowing dam. It's getting to the top, and it's
ready to burst. When it does, it's going to flood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hourglass is slipping, especially for this team. We're one
of the veteran teams in the league, so we have to seize the moment
now.''

FINLEY'S ERROR HURTS ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Nearly all of Chuck Finley's pitches Monday
night were thrown with impeccable accuracy, but it was a throw in
the opposite direction that cost the Angels pitcher in a 5-2 loss
to the San Francisco Giants before 13,661 at 3Com Park.
</P>
<P>
   A potential double-play comebacker to Finley instead wound up
rolling in the grass in shallow center field and led to four
unearned runs in a four-run fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   With runners on first and second and one out, the Giants' Brent
Mayne hit a one-hopper back to Finley, who fielded it with no
problem, but his throw to shortstop Andy Sheets covering second was
wide. Sheets dived to his right and got a glove on the ball, but it
caromed into center field, allowing Stan Javier to score the first
run of the game.
</P>
<P>
   One out later, F.P. Santangelo hit one of Finley's few (begin
ital)pitching(end ital) mistakes of the game over the fence in left
field for a three-run homer and a 4-0 Giants lead.
</P>
<P>
   In six innings, Finley (4-6) allowed only three hits and was
coming off a strong outing his last time out _ one run in eight
innings in a victory over the Twins.
</P>
<P>
   He started out fine Monday, allowing one hit through four
innings. After he got the first out in the fifth, Javier singled
and Rich Aurilia walked, setting up Mayne and the fateful play of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Giants starter Russ Ortiz (7-4) shut out the Angels for six
innings on two hits, but the Angels got something going in the
seventh. Orlando Palmeiro singled with one out and went to third on
a single to right by Troy Glaus. Palmeiro then scored and Glaus
took second on a wild pitch. After Matt Walbeck singled Glaus to
third, Andy Sheets grounded out, Glaus scoring to cut the Angels'
deficit to 4-2. Jeff Huson, pinch-hitting for Finley, walked,
spelling the end of the night for Ortiz.
</P>
<P>
   Giants reliever Jerry Spradlin entered the game and hit Randy
Velarde with a pitch, loading the bases. Giants manager Dusty Baker
then went to his bullpen again, summoning lefty Rich Rodriguez to
face Darin Erstad, who grounded out to second to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants increased their lead to 5-2 in the seventh when
Javier singled and scored on a double to right field by Mayne.

NO ARENA LEASE. NO ORGANIZATION. NO PLAN. HERE COMES WNBA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Amid the gee-whizzing at Monday's news conference
announcing that the WNBA was coming to Seattle, the feeling was
that the whole enterprise just fell out of bed.
</P>
<P>
   No one seemed to know much beyond the fact that Seattle was one
of four new expansion franchises awarded Monday by the Great
Omniscience, the NBA, for the summer (not winter) of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   No KeyArena lease. No organization. No ticket plan. Only the
vaguest acknowledgment of the WNBA's requirements, including the
fact that the franchise award is conditional, not guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was there any sense of irony that the reason the event was
happening at all was because the NBA had helped put its rival _ the
American Basketball League, including the Seattle Reign franchise _
out of business last winter.
</P>
<P>
   The loopiness at the Sonics practice facility was captured best
by none other than the esteemed mayor of Seattle, Paul Schell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to celebrate. Negotiate tomorrow,'' said Schell,
offering a slogan that certainly works for me if I'm in a toga and
he's the head of Animal House. But I thought mayors worked more
deliberately when turning over public facilities to private
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, what the heck. It's women's hoops, so standards of logic and
civic protocol tend to get suspended.
</P>
<P>
   The laudable eagerness to re-establish the game as a
professional beacon for female athletes certainly was palpable.
City Council member Tina Podlodowski, whose charge is to protect
the public interest in the incomplete KeyArena deal, excitedly and
repeatedly offered Monday to buy the first 10 season tickets, never
mind the conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Nor could anyone explain how it was that Seattle was deemed a
hotbed for women's hoops when its franchise and league had died for
lack of widespread interest _ during a lockout of the NBA men's
game, no less _ and attendance at the much-admired University of
Washington women's program fell to a six-year low.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did anyone really know how the team was going to meet the
league-mandated minimum season-ticket sales of 5,500 by Oct. 15 in
a busy sports market in which the Reign never sold more than 2,000.
Even the Reign's three-year average attendance of less than 4,000
at Mercer Arena was suspect. ABL co-founder Gary Cavalli told the
P-I last November that 25 percent of the attendance counts in the
league's first two seasons included complimentary tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Although the predictable lamentations were issued over the
demise of the Reign, no twinge of anxiety was detected at sliding
into the sack with the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut attorney
general, issued a subpoena to the NBA after an investigation into
whether the league conspired to monopolize women's basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said he had information indicating that the NBA
actively hastened the collapse of the ABL.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's evidence the NBA used sharp economic elbows to exclude
the ABL ... from fair play _ including access to essential
financial rights like TV and product sponsorships,'' Blumenthal
said.
</P>
<P>
   None of these matters were derailing the politicians and Sonic
bosses Monday from joining other NBA teams in their singular and
noble purpose for the WNBA enterprise:
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring arena filler.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the ABL, which seemed sincere in its desire for
grass-roots growth of the women's game, and paid good salaries, the
WNBA is mostly a way to fill dates in buildings owned by the
franchises. The WNBA typically makes money by paying its players
store-clerk entry salaries and doubling the work of staff from the
men's franchise.
</P>
<P>
   For the Sonics' business arm, Full House Sports and
Entertainment, the women's franchise is the same economic racket as
the SeaDogs, which I believe was a men's indoor soccer team _
though witnesses are few _ that folded a couple of summers ago.
</P>
<P>
   This region is littered with the carcasses of sports franchises
besides the Reign that began with lofty ambitions: the original
Sounders, Storm and Tacoma Tides (men's outdoor soccer); Tacoma
Stars (men's indoor soccer); Smashers (volleyball); Cascades
(tennis); Totems (hockey); and Rainiers (the longtime Class AAA
Pacific Coast League baseball team, plus a Class A version that
died in 1976).
</P>
<P>
   One difference between those failures and the impending
psychological assault by the WNBA was explained, inadvertently, by
Full House's president, John Dresel.
</P>
<P>
   The key to success, he said, was ``selling the game before the
season starts.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, relentless, remorseless hype, as only the NBA
can do. Armed with a willing network lap dog in NBC, the NBA knows
if it screams loud and long enough and insists that hipness is
nigh, the gullible American sports public will show up to watch a
tire-pumping tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Sonic operatives at the moment might be almost clueless about
what just landed on their doorstep. But by next summer, this
junior-varsity team and calendar-stuffer will be affixed to the
local sporting consciousness like a Rodman tattoo, no matter how
many people didn't request it.

SEATTLE `THIS CLOSE' TO NETTING WNBA FRANCHISE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Pending a successful season ticket campaign, women's
professional basketball will return to Seattle next summer. The
Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) awarded Seattle one
of four expansion franchises Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The new team _ not yet named _ will be operated by the Seattle
SuperSonics and begin play in the summer of 2000, providing it
secures pledges for 5,500 season tickets by Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Also awarded expansion franchises for next year were Portland,
Indianapolis and Miami. The four expansion sites were chosen from
among 14 NBA cities interested in attracting the country's only pro
women's basketball league.
</P>
<P>
   The newcomers would boost the women's league to 16 teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cities we came up with reflect the best mix of being in
parts of the country we're not currently represented in and in
being with (NBA) teams that are well-developed in basketball with
good top management and high-end facilities,'' said WNBA President
Val Ackerman.
</P>
<P>
   NBA sources say Denver was the only other serious contender for
the 2000 expansion, but the pending sale of the city's NBA Nuggets
may have complicated its WNBA bid.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman noted Seattle's interest in women's basketball
``particularly by the University of Washington's teams and the fan
base laid by the ABL team'' _ the Seattle Reign, which ceased
operations when the American Basketball League folded last
December.
</P>
<P>
   But as optimistic as Ackerman is, Seattle's WNBA deal
technically is not completed. The Sonics lack a signed lease for
use of city-owned KeyArena, and, in addition to selling the
required number of season tickets, Seattle, like all the new
franchises, must:
</P>
<P>
   -- Secure a broadcast deal for local radio and TV coverage. At
least six games must be televised locally.
</P>
<P>
   -- Set up a staff exclusively for the WNBA side of operations.
</P>
<P>
   -- Make a substantial financial commitment for top-rate
promotions, advertising, marketing and team operational spending.
It would also include an undisclosed ``franchise fee.''
</P>
<P>
   Full House Sports and Entertainment, which will run the Seattle
WNBA team, announced Monday that KJR (950-AM) will handle the
team's radio broadcasts. And although the group hasn't priced
season tickets yet, a $50 deposit will secure a season ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is the season ticket pledges,''
Ackerman said. ``Beyond that the teams are now probably going to
start doing some civic ground-laying, reaching out to local media
and tapping into the fan base that's been most fertile for the WNBA
_ and that's family.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's previous women's pro team, the Seattle Reign played
two and a third ABL seasons before the league went bankrupt in
December.
</P>
<P>
   Ginger Ackerley, co-chairwoman of the Ackerley Group that owns
the SuperSonics, called NBA Commissioner David Stern when the ABL
folded, to find out how she could secure a WNBA franchise for the
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Reign left, this city was absolutely grieving,'' said
Ackerley, who will serve as chairwoman of Seattle's WNBA team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think many of us realized how much the Reign meant to
this community until after the team left.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately the community's support of women's basketball will
decide the team's fate.
</P>
<P>
   Playing at Mercer Arena, the Reign drew more fans for each of
its seasons, but the final figures were only about 1,900 season
ticket holders and an average attendance of 4,013.
</P>
<P>
   The new WNBA team will play at KeyArena, which seats 17,072.
</P>
<P>
   Those involved with the WNBA expansion franchise say that
selling 5,500 season tickets for a summertime basketball schedule
will be the team's first big hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilwoman Tina Podlodowski challenged the area's
``high-tech millionaires'' to buy tickets and donate them to local
children if that's what the city needs to meet its quota.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerley said she's not ``terribly concerned'' about meeting
season ticket obligations, saying, ``This basketball is exciting.
Some people just don't know it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   And Full House has promised an aggressive marketing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our immediate access to a large base of basketball fans is
right there because of the Sonics,'' said Full House President John
Dresel. ``We've been in the basketball business for 16 years, and
hopefully that experience will help us now.''
</P>
<P>
   Full House is still negotiating the KeyArena lease deal with the
city, but both sides characterized the discussions as friendly.
Dresel and Mayor Paul Schell refused to give any details, but
Dresel said the deal could be finalized later this week.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the Ackerley group last month, Schell offered
concessions to a start-up WNBA franchise using KeyArena. He offered
to lower the rent for WNBA games; let Full House retain all ticket,
concession, merchandise and sponsorship revenue; and give the
organization the same scheduling rights it has to Sonics games.
</P>
<P>
   All parking and admission tax revenue from WNBA games would be
retained by the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the issues we've had are being taken care of,'' said
Podlodowski, who also insisted she was supremely confident in the
upcoming season ticket drive.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle group will meet with Ackerman next week, and then
team officials hope to announce a timetable to hire a general
manager and come up with a name and logo.
</P>
<P>
   The Reign hasn't been ruled out, but the team hasn't decided how
or when it will pick a name.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me it's not the name or the logo, it's the tickets and the
question is when can I get them,'' Podlodowski said.

OVITZ, BROAD DISCUSS JOINING FORCES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The two groups competing and sometimes clashing
for the Los Angeles NFL franchise met for the first time this
weekend to discuss possibly merging their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Neither would discuss specifics of their Sunday-morning meeting
but plan to talk again within the next 10 days to further explore
joining forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at that hard,'' said Eli Broad. ``There is a
desire to do it, we've got to work out how you do it. There are a
lot of issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broad and Ed Roski Jr. group has been competing with the
rival Michael Ovitz and Ron Burkle group for ownership of the NFL's
32nd franchise, which has been tentatively awarded to Los Angeles
and the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz had proposed an entire new stadium for the city of Carson
and had less than six weeks to develop a design for renovating the
76-year-old Coliseum after the NFL announced in April it had been
selected the expansion site.
</P>
<P>
   The former Hollywood superagent's splashy design for the
Coliseum impressed owners when they met in Atlanta two weeks ago.
But commissioner Paul Tagliabue, concerned whether the plan could
get local approvals, said the NFL was encouraging the two sides to
merge in a unified Los Angeles effort.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz previously had been offered an opportunity to join the
Broad-Roski group but said he wanted to pursue his own Coliseum
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Sunday morning, Ron Burkle and I met casually with Eli
Broad and Ed Roski,'' Ovitz said in a statement. ``Our meeting was
cordial.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I have said all along, my ownership group's top priority is
to bring professional football back to Los Angeles, and we are
willing to explore any ideas that increase Los Angeles' chances
with an NFL franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Fabiani, an Ovitz adviser, said the four leaders of the two
groups met at Burkle's home. Broad called Sunday's meeting
``preliminary'' and said he came away neither encouraged nor
frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in the middle,'' Broad said. ``We both have the same
thoughts, but there are a lot of things to be ironed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good meeting, but nothing was concluded and we're
going to meet again. There is a lot to talk about when you do
something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The groups' separate redesigns of the Coliseum would each cost
approximately $300 million, but to meet the NFL demands, Ovitz's
original plan called for parking garages around the stadium with
27,000 spaces that could cost an additional $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   The five parking garages, which would likely require public
funding, drew immediate criticism from public officials. The
recommended Broad parking proposal includes one $67.5-million
garage and using parking at USC.

   MEXICO-BIRTH (Mexico City) _ Like many old-style Mexican
matriarchs, Emma Castro Amador bore so many children that she can't
keep their birthdays straight, but all 14 of her children say they
are determined to limit their own families to two or three. The
national birth rate is down from an average of 7 to 2.5 and that
means a lot, for the entire continent. Next year, Mexico's
population is projected to reach 100 million, and the contrast
between Mrs. Castro's family and those of her children illustrates
the extraordinary changes under way in the country's population
patterns. By Sam Dillon.

a kind of molecular power drill deployed by tumors to punch their

is a one-hit wonder. It learns a tune in its youth, and then is
condemned to repeat it forever, like an aging pop star on the

feedback, listening to its own sounds and comparing them to a song
in its head until it gets it right. Little has been known about how
a mature finch, a ``closed learner'' (compared to a canary, for

these days, but one quantity remains eternally, enragingly

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
CHICAGO _ Jose Lima hadn't made his way back to the visitors'
clubhouse when his merengue music was heard blasting away.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's baseball custom that the pitcher gets to select the music
after a victory. The way Lima has pitched this season, the compact
disc is in place. All the Astros have to do is push the button.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funny part is he isn't even in the clubhouse, and we have
his music going,'' first baseman Jeff Bagwell said. ``We're
starting to understand what's going on here.''
</P>
<P>
   So is the rest of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Lima became the National League's first 10-game winner and the
Astros rebounded from one of their most humbling showings of the
season to defeat the Chicago White Sox 8-2 Monday night at Comiskey
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Lima (10-2) matched the club record for reaching double-figure
wins in the fewest appearances, accomplishing it in 12 starts. In
1964, Dick ``Turk'' Farrell went 10-1 in his first 12 games for the
Colt .45s.
</P>
<P>
   Does Lima believe he has been slighted when it comes to national
attention?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody mentions Jose Lima,'' said Lima, who won 16 games last
year but didn't post his 10th victory until Aug. 1. ``I only hear
about everybody else. That's OK. I don't want anybody saying
anything about me. I'm going to stay quiet and keep winning games.
I'm going to keep taking care of business.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lima isn't making any friends on Chicago's south side. The
righthander pumped his right arm after getting Frank Thomas to hit
a comebacker to end the fifth inning and was booed by the crowd of
16,881. Lima tipped his cap as he walked to the dugout, drawing
more boos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it, and I'm sure his teammates don't like it,''
said Chicago designated hitter Paul Konerko, who matched a career
high with three hits. ``It's fine to be emotional, but you don't
show up a player like Frank. I'm surprised he does that in the
National League, because he has to bat. I'd be surprised if he
doesn't have bruises all over his back.''
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, White Sox reliever David Lundquist threw a ball
inside that sent Craig Biggio heading for the dirt and drew a
warning from home-plate umpire Jim Joyce.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't a brushback (pitch),'' Chicago manager Jerry
Manuel said. ``That's not our style. He was just pitching him in.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima allowed eight hits, walked one and struck out three in his
third complete game of the year. And as long as he continues to
win, his teammates don't plan on changing any of his routines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White Sox haven't seen him, but everybody through our
league knows how he is,'' Bagwell said. ``I'm not a big proponent
of it usually, but I know Jose, and he's the same way tonight as he
will be tomorrow and the next day and the next day whether he wins
or loses. I don't have a problem with that, because he's an
emotional guy. He doesn't mean any harm. If you listen to him out
there, he's yelling at himself, not at anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago starter John Snyder (6-5) had cause to yell at himself,
failing to make it out of the fourth inning. Snyder allowed six
runs (five earned) and 10 hits in 3 innings, his second-shortest
outing of the season. During his four-game losing streak, Snyder
has allowed 22 earned runs in 19 innings _ a 10.42 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, who were drubbed 13-6 the day before at Minnesota,
finished with 17 hits, one short of their season high set May 11
against Pittsburgh. Bill Spiers had three hits and drove in two
runs, Derek Bell hit a two-run single in a five-run fourth inning,
and Tony Eusebio went 3-for-5.
</P>
<P>
   Every Astros starter had at least one hit, and the top four
hitters _ Biggio, Spiers, Bagwell and Bell _ went 9-for-19 with
five runs and six RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros batted around in the fourth inning, with the first
five hitters reaching base safely. With the game tied at 1,
designated hitter Daryle Ward led off with a single, Eusebio
doubled, and Ricky Gutierrez broke the tie with an RBI single.
Biggio then reached on an error by White Sox shortstop Mike Caruso
that allowed Eusebio to score, and Spiers doubled in Gutierrez.
After Bagwell lined out, Bell cleared the bases with a single to
center field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Derek and I started to swing the bat a little better,'' said
Biggio, who had two hits after entering the game batting .206 on
the road trip. ``In order for us to score a lot of runs, Derek and
I have to get on base. If one of us isn't doing the job, the other
has to do the job. Everybody really contributed today.''
</P>
<P>
   In seven of Lima's 12 starts, the Astros have supported him with
at least a half-dozen runs. Does it have something to do with the
music?
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked one of the coaches before the game, `Do you think we
get ready for the game better by taking infield practice or by
coming in here and listening to that (merengue) music?''' Dierker
said. ``I think the consensus was the music was better.''

DAVIS, HALAMA BOOST MARINERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ This isn't football, so the prize for a job well done
is not a game ball. More appropriate is a handshake, a cold one and
a small sense of pride lasting only until the next day.
</P>
<P>
   But efforts like the one Russ Davis gave Monday night would seem
to deserve a bit more. At least, Alex Rodriguez thought so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, the ball for this game goes to Russ Davis,'' said
the Mariners shortstop, after several standout plays by Davis
ensured a 4-2 win over the Colorado Rockies. ``He didn't want it,
and I was just messing around with him. But that's how you win
games. He played great, great defense, and that's more valuable
than four hits. He must have saved four runs for us tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The third baseman's efforts helped John Halama (4-2) win his
second consecutive start, another sterling effort in which he
worked quickly, used all his pitches and lasted deep into the game.
He struck out one and did not walk a batter until the last one he
faced, Larry Walker, with one out in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Halama needed 91 pitches to get 22 outs; the day before at Coors
Field, Rockies starter Pedro Astacio had needed 153 pitches to get
23.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really couldn't care less about strikeouts,'' Halama said.
``If I could repeat this performance throughout the whole year, I'd
be very happy. I had one strikeout, who cares? Strikeouts are just
for statistics. I would rather get the hitters to swing in the
first two or three pitches and get out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   Halama's pace _ he had three seven-pitch innings _ helped the
defense behind him. That was about all Davis would say, sticking to
his rule of just playing, ignoring any criticism or praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``When guys are throwing strikes and going after guys, your legs
feel a lot fresher than when you're standing out there for 45
minutes in one inning,'' Davis said. ``It's a heck of a lot easier
to play.''
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning, Davis made a diving stab down the line to
hold Darryl Hamilton to a single, stopping the lead runner at
second. He ended that inning with a belly-flop grab of a ground
ball by Walker, throwing him out to leave two runners in scoring
position.
</P>
<P>
   Davis started a double play to erase a leadoff single in the
sixth, then doubled up Dante Bichette with the bases loaded in the
eighth inning, preserving the Mariners' two-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw him two sinkers, because I was looking for the ground
ball double play,'' said Jose Paniagua, who induced the grounder
after relieving Halama. ``That's the pitch I use all the time with
one out and a right-handed hitter. That's exactly what Lou told me
when he gave me the ball: `Throw (it) inside and jam him.'''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Lou Piniella has gotten that kind of performance from
Paniagua since last August, when the right-hander was called up
from Class AAA Tacoma. What he's not used to seeing is such solid
defense. The Mariners came into Monday night's game fourth in the
American League in defense, and tied for first in double plays.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' turnaround has been exceptional. At this point last year,
he had 14 errors, on his way to a franchise-record 34. So far in
'99, he has made only five, and just one since April 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played very well defensively,'' Piniella said. ``That's
the biggest improvement in our ballclub over last year. We have
really picked up the pace with the glove. We're turning more double
plays, and really helping our pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Another improvement: the Randy Johnson factor. At this point in
'98, Johnson was 5-4. The two starters Seattle acquired when they
traded Johnson to Houston, Halama and Freddy Garcia, are a combined
11-4 in '99.
</P>
<P>
   And they're also hitting. Garcia contributed a broken-bat,
run-scoring single to his victory in San Diego Sunday, and Halama's
opposite-field double to left started the go-ahead rally in
Seattle's two-run fifth Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Halama scored on a double by Rodriguez, which gave the M's a 2-1
lead. Rodriguez then scored on the first of two RBI singles by
Butch Huskey.
</P>
<P>
   ``That proves (I had) a lot of luck,'' said Halama, who was on
base three times, of his first major league hit. ``That's all that
proves. It's a case of the ball hitting the bat, because I just
swung as hard as I could. I was so late. I felt so out of place out
there from a hitting standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   There were times last year when Davis looked out of place from a
fielding standpoint. But not this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a matter of him getting his confidence,''
Rodriguez said. ``I've always complimented him on his good hands.''
</P>
<P>
   When a guy doesn't want a game ball, a compliment will have to
do.

DODGERS LOSE WHITE, GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One Dodger was injured, another didn't come up
with (begin ital)the(end ital) hit that could change the game, and
there was a lot of optimism afterward as to when this season will
begin to take the shape it was already supposed to take.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, just another Dodgers game.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers lost to the Texas Rangers 3-2 Monday at Dodger
Stadium to keep fresh their rhythm of inconsistency. They've lost
the last two games to fall to 28-28 after they'd won two.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you're going to hit, sometimes you're going to
pitch, and the good teams put it together,'' Dodgers reliever Alan
Mills said. ``We're not doing that. Whenever you have a team with
the talent we have, it's going to draw attention and expectations.
But I don't think it's late enough in the season for anybody to
push a panic button.''
</P>
<P>
   On this particular occasion, the injured party was center
fielder Devon White. He left after straining his right groin while
chasing former Dodger Todd Zeile's RBI double in the second inning.
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said he doesn't anticipate White
playing in the next two games against the Rangers. White missed
seven games with a strained right hamstring in mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   It makes the already tenuous outfield situation, which was
tediously dissected for the past two weeks, again unstable and
without options. Todd Hollandsworth is on the disabled list with a
torn oblique muscle (right side of rib cage) so the club is
carrying four outfielders. With White unavailable, it leaves
Trenidad Hubbard, Raul Mondesi and Gary Sheffield as the healthy
bodies and means Johnson is limited on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   It was to the point against the Rangers where the Dodgers' top
pinch hitter, Dave Hansen, played right field in the ninth. It was
the first outfield stint of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hope nobody else gets hurt,'' Johnson said. ``We got Hansen
and Tripp (Cromer) out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hansen's been brilliant as a pinch hitter this season (9 for 21)
but popped out foul in his chance to tie the game or give the
Dodgers a lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were unable to produce any offense against the
usually hittable Aaron Sele, who yielded two runs in seven-plus
innings. It was the fewest runs he's allowed since April 22.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers chased Sele (6-4) in the eighth after Eric Young's
leadoff single, but after loading the bases with one out, scored
only on Eric Karros' sacrifice lineout to left that made it 3-2.
Hansen, pinch hitting for Hubbard who replaced White, popped out to
end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers closer John Wetteland pitched a perfect ninth for his
major- league-best 20th save.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens like that,'' Mills said. ``Take the ball Karros hit
to give us our second run. A little more right, a little more
left.... Right now, as a team, we're not clicking. I just think
it's a matter of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the Rangers came up with the big hit and the big
pitch in crucial situations. Before reliever Jeff Zimmerman got
Hansen to pop out, Rafael Palmeiro (3 for 4) singled in a run in
the top of the eighth off Dodgers starter Ismael Valdes (5-4) to
give the Rangers a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I thought he was going to hang another curveball to
(Palmeiro), I would have hooked him,'' Johnson said. ``Three times
he did the same thing. It was a great effort. If he wasn't throwing
the ball really good, I'd have hooked him. I had people ready for
(Palmeiro). It was his to win or lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rodriguez followed with his RBI single as Texas went ahead
3-1. Those hits, coupled with the pitching from Zimmerman, show why
the AL West-leading Rangers (34-22) have won 11 of their last 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this stretch, we've played a lot of games like this,''
Texas manager Johnny Oates said. ``We didn't have too many games
like that in our first 30. They were 9-8, 14-3.''

FINLEY'S ERROR COSTS ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Nearly all of Chuck Finley's pitches Monday
night were thrown with impeccable accuracy, but it was a throw in
the opposite direction that cost the Angels pitcher in a 5-2 loss
to the San Francisco Giants before 13,661 at 3Com Park.
</P>
<P>
   A potential double-play comebacker to Finley instead wound up
rolling in the grass in shallow center field and led to four
unearned runs in a four-run fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   With runners on first and second and one out, the Giants' Brent
Mayne hit a one-hopper back to Finley. He fielded it with no
problem, but his throw to shortstop Andy Sheets covering second was
wide. Sheets dived to his right and got a glove on the ball, but it
caromed into center field, allowing Stan Javier to score the first
run of the game.
</P>
<P>
   One out later, F.P. Santangelo hit one of Finley's few (begin
ital)pitching(end ital) mistakes of the game over the fence in left
field for a three-run homer and a 4-0 Giants lead.
</P>
<P>
   Finley was coming off a strong outing his last time out _ one
run in eight innings in a victory over the Twins. In six innings
Monday, Finley (4-6) allowed only three hits, walked two and struck
out four.
</P>
<P>
   Finley allowed one hit through four innings, but after he got
the first out in the fifth, Javier singled and Rich Aurilia walked,
setting up Mayne and the fateful play of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw it away, man,'' Finley said. ``The bottom line is I
threw the ball into center field, and I pretty much threw the game
away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about the Angels' season? Are they throwing it away,
too? It's more than a month before the All-Star break, but their
7{-game deficit in the AL West is the largest in manager Terry
Collins' two-plus years with the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not really getting any better right now,'' Finley said.
``You try to hold on, hold on until you get guys back in the
lineup. Keep playing hard and not let anybody get so far ahead they
get so small you can't make 'em out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get hot sooner or later. But 7{ games out, we
don't have many games to give.''
</P>
<P>
   Giants starter Russ Ortiz (7-4) shut out the Angels for six
innings on two hits, but the Angels got something going against him
in the seventh. Orlando Palmeiro singled with one out and went to
third on a single to right by Troy Glaus. Palmeiro then scored and
Glaus took second on a wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   After Matt Walbeck singled Glaus to third, Sheets grounded out,
Glaus scoring to cut the Angels' deficit to 4-2. Jeff Huson, pinch
hitting for Finley, walked, spelling the end of the night for
Ortiz.
</P>
<P>
   Giants reliever Jerry Spradlin entered the game and hit Randy
Velarde with a pitch, loading the bases. Velarde remained in the
game despite being hit with a 95-mph fastball in the ribs.
</P>
<P>
   Giants manager Dusty Baker then went to his bullpen again,
summoning lefty Rich Rodriguez to face Darin Erstad, who grounded
out to second to end the threat. Erstad, who went 0 for 4 and saw
his average fall to .227, stranded six baserunners Monday,
including four in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Finley) pitched a great ballgame, but once again it was one
of those things where you just can't make any errors,'' Collins
said. ``And we didn't give him anything to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the offense continues to struggle, Finley refused to
share any blame for the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to doing what you're supposed to do,'' he said.
``It was an easy double play and I screwed it up. I knew when I
threw it. I was hoping Andy was late getting to the bag, but he had
all his momentum going to second.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants increased their lead to 5-2 in the seventh when
Javier singled and scored on a double to right field by Mayne.

<P>
   Attention, fashion firms that are still showing baggy pants:
Hip-hop style has moved on. Oversized clothes from head to toe are
out.
</P>
<P>
   Try a more tailored look. That's the consensus of four New
York-based trend spotters _ Jane Rinzler Buckingham, president of
Youth Intelligence; Liz DiPilli, director of Project X; Haysun
Hahn, director of Bureau de Style; and Andy Hilfiger, vice
president of public relations for Tommy Jeans _ who were asked what
will be hot over the next two years not only in fashion, but in
music, which is playing an increased role in design inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   These connoisseurs of cool talked about emerging cultural trends
and offered some specifics on where the color palette is heading.
</P>
<P>
   They also indicated that the relentless advance of technology
was a motivating factor in a growing interest in clothes that offer
the kind of craftsmanship associated with a simpler age.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of their predictions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LIZ DIPILLI, Project X, which tracks trends among 14- to
29-year-olds &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DiPilli, whose past and current clients include RJR Reynolds,
Reebok and Conde Nast, said she tracks styles in cities such as New
York, Miami, San Francisco, London and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing a more structured look,'' she said.``This whole
baggy clothes look is fading fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Cargo pants, for example, are getting slimmer. Another trend
DiPilli believes is getting stronger is an interest in handmade
looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fabric bags made in velvet, corduroy or denim are becoming
more important,'' she said. ``Overall, there's an interest in
anything embroidered or anything that has beadwork.''
</P>
<P>
   DiPilli pointed out that consumers' interest in the environment,
together with a continued longing for spirituality, is only going
to get stronger.
</P>
<P>
   She sees an increased interest in world music, whether French,
Afro-Caribbean or Eastern European. Hip-hop, she said, continues to
be a powerful force, but it is starting to break out into different
strains.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's salsa hip-hop, Afro-Caribbean hip-hop,'' she said.
``You will start seeing it further fracture.'' .
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; JANE RINZLER BUCKINGHAM, president, Youth Intelligence, which
advises such clients as Coca-Cola, MTV, Polo Jeans, Chanel and
Sprint &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham scours the streets of New York, as well as college
towns such as Austin, Texas; Boulder, Colo.; Burlington, Vt.; and
Chapel Hill, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   She pointed out that she not only checks out college students
for inspiration, but also recent graduates, who might still be
living in those towns.
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham also cited the Williamsburg area of Brooklyn, an
increasingly attractive area for young people because the rents
there are much more affordable than in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Other areas she visits are Salt Lake City, where she sees a
``weird punk movement going on,'' as well as London and Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham believes fashion trends will be coming out of
less-traveled places such as South Africa and China, where there is
increased access.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see people getting inspired by accessories from China,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   With the growth of all the Internet technology, Buckingham
believes that those very same young people who are plugging in to
cyberspace want to ``counterbalance'' it by wearing fashions that
are or feel custom-made.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is so impersonal,'' she said. ``It is driven by
speed and function. It is not like they are going to walk away from
technology, but there is a real interest in luxury fabrics. There's
an interest in special details, in craftsmanship, in beading.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; HAYSUN HAHN, director of Bureau de Style, which tracks trends for a
diverse list of companies, from Escada to Samsung &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Much of the '90s has been about developing a democratic
individual style, mixing a Prada handbag with a tank from Kmart,
for example.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Hahn sees the emergence of a class of ``elite snobs,'' who
buy only the top designer brands and won't dream of mixing status
brands with cheaper ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the absolute design victims. They wear only Prada and
other designs _ even for just comfort,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This trend, she said, started about a year and a half ago, when
some of the top designers, such as Prada, Gucci and Donna Karan,
went after utilitarian looks, serving up $1,000 hooded zip-front
jackets in luxurious cashmere, or rubber-soled shoes that sell for
$270.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, there are the Gucci denim jeans with holes that
retail for more than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, we had an idea that a pair of khaki pants or a
T-shirt had a specific value,'' Hahn said. ``But not any more.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposite of the ``elite snob'' class is what Hahn calls
``the celebrity, media-conscious'' type who prefers glitzier
makeup, bright colors, and wants to look sexy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the big fans of Spice Girls and Jerry Springer's
show,'' she said. ``They are into clothes that make you sexy. They
are not into the design of the clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hahn believes retailers and apparel firms in both of these
categories must take note of this.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to make an instant connection with their consumer in
a much more exclusive, segmented, lifestyle way,'' she said. ``It
is not about buying a designer product and then going to the Gap to
buy your T-shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Retailers catering to the affluent must offer appropriate
services that pamper the customers, she said, while stores that
target those taken in by celebrity need to develop appropriate
partnerships with pop singers and the like.
</P>
<P>
   As for specific trends, Hahn sees a growing importance in
clothes that shape the body, such as the carryalls that wrap around
the body.
</P>
<P>
   She also sees a continued interest in necklines and believes
styles such as cowlnecks will be important over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be about the midriff,'' she said. ``Now, it has
moved up.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANDY HILFIGER, vice president of public relations at Tommy Jeans,
whose job is to develop alliances with music stars: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hilfiger's favorite New York hangouts are Sway, a club on
Greenwich Street, and Nell's, on West 14th Street, which features
hip-hop music on Sunday nights. He believes the connection between
music and fashion will grow even stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year, you will see more and more musicians aligning with
clothing companies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Jeans, which sponsored the Rolling Stones' ``No Security''
tour, has plans to design special stage gear for Britney Spears.
</P>
<P>
   As reported, Tommy Girl, produced under license by Estee
Lauder's Aramis division, is one of the sponsors of the Lilith
Fair.
</P>
<P>
   Hilfiger described the latest music scene, featuring such stars
as Spears, Backstreet Boys and N-Sync who are inspired by R&AMP;B, as
``hip pop.''
</P>
<P>
   As for hip-hop fashions, Hilfiger pointed out that the trend is
not about having a complete baggy look.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is about either having a tight top and a loose bottom, or
vice versa,'' he said. ``The future is mixing a T-shirt with
designer collection pants.''
</P>
<P>
   He also pointed to the trend of mixing athleticwear with
fashion, citing athletic nylon basketball pants with cropped
leather jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Hilfiger believes the fashion industry's interest in the
American rock scene of decades ago is only going to get stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Designers are looking at rock 'n' roll groups of the '60s and
'70s, and recreating it for the '90s,'' he said. &QL;

   Hahn believes retailers and apparel firms in both of these
categories must take note of this.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Retailers catering to the affluent must offer appropriate
services that pamper the customers, she said, while stores that
target those taken in by celebrity need to develop appropriate
partnerships with pop singers and the like.
</P>
<P>
   As for specific trends, Hahn sees a growing importance in
clothes that shape the body, such as the carryalls that wrap around
the body.
</P>
<P>
   She also sees a continued interest in necklines and believes
styles such as cowlnecks will be important over the next two years.

<P>
   Attention, fashion firms that are still showing baggy pants:
Hip-hop style has moved on. Oversized clothes from head to toe are
out.
</P>
<P>
   Try a more tailored look. That's the consensus of four New
York-based trend spotters _ Jane Rinzler Buckingham, president of
Youth Intelligence; Liz DiPilli, director of Project X; Haysun
Hahn, director of Bureau de Style; and Andy Hilfiger, vice
president of public relations for Tommy Jeans _ who were asked what
will be hot over the next two years not only in fashion, but in
music, which is playing an increased role in design inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   These connoisseurs of cool talked about emerging cultural trends
and offered some specifics on where the color palette is heading.
</P>
<P>
   They also indicated that the relentless advance of technology
was a motivating factor in a growing interest in clothes that offer
the kind of craftsmanship associated with a simpler age.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of their predictions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LIZ DIPILLI, Project X, which tracks trends among 14- to
29-year-olds &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DiPilli, whose past and current clients include RJR Reynolds,
Reebok and Conde Nast, said she tracks styles in cities such as New
York, Miami, San Francisco, London and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing a more structured look,'' she said.``This whole
baggy clothes look is fading fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Cargo pants, for example, are getting slimmer. Another trend
DiPilli believes is getting stronger is an interest in handmade
looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fabric bags made in velvet, corduroy or denim are becoming
more important,'' she said. ``Overall, there's an interest in
anything embroidered or anything that has beadwork.''
</P>
<P>
   DiPilli pointed out that consumers' interest in the environment,
together with a continued longing for spirituality, is only going
to get stronger.
</P>
<P>
   She sees an increased interest in world music, whether French,
Afro-Caribbean or Eastern European. Hip-hop, she said, continues to
be a powerful force, but it is starting to break out into different
strains.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's salsa hip-hop, Afro-Caribbean hip-hop,'' she said.
``You will start seeing it further fracture.'' .

<P>
   &UR; JANE RINZLER BUCKINGHAM, president, Youth Intelligence, which
advises such clients as Coca-Cola, MTV, Polo Jeans, Chanel and
Sprint &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham scours the streets of New York, as well as college
towns such as Austin, Texas; Boulder, Colo.; Burlington, Vt.; and
Chapel Hill, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   She pointed out that she not only checks out college students
for inspiration, but also recent graduates, who might still be
living in those towns.
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham also cited the Williamsburg area of Brooklyn, an
increasingly attractive area for young people because the rents
there are much more affordable than in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Other areas she visits are Salt Lake City, where she sees a
``weird punk movement going on,'' as well as London and Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham believes fashion trends will be coming out of
less-traveled places such as South Africa and China, where there is
increased access.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see people getting inspired by accessories from China,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   With the growth of all the Internet technology, Buckingham
believes that those very same young people who are plugging in to
cyberspace want to ``counterbalance'' it by wearing fashions that
are or feel custom-made.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is so impersonal,'' she said. ``It is driven by
speed and function. It is not like they are going to walk away from
technology, but there is a real interest in luxury fabrics. There's
an interest in special details, in craftsmanship, in beading.''

<P>
   &UR; HAYSUN HAHN, director of Bureau de Style, which tracks trends for a
diverse list of companies, from Escada to Samsung &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Much of the '90s has been about developing a democratic
individual style, mixing a Prada handbag with a tank from Kmart,
for example.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Hahn sees the emergence of a class of ``elite snobs,'' who
buy only the top designer brands and won't dream of mixing status
brands with cheaper ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the absolute design victims. They wear only Prada and
other designs _ even for just comfort,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This trend, she said, started about a year and a half ago, when
some of the top designers, such as Prada, Gucci and Donna Karan,
went after utilitarian looks, serving up $1,000 hooded zip-front
jackets in luxurious cashmere, or rubber-soled shoes that sell for
$270.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, there are the Gucci denim jeans with holes that
retail for more than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, we had an idea that a pair of khaki pants or a
T-shirt had a specific value,'' Hahn said. ``But not any more.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposite of the ``elite snob'' class is what Hahn calls
``the celebrity, media-conscious'' type who prefers glitzier
makeup, bright colors, and wants to look sexy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the big fans of Spice Girls and Jerry Springer's
show,'' she said. ``They are into clothes that make you sexy. They
are not into the design of the clothes.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Buckingham also cited the Williamsburg area of Brooklyn, an
increasingly attractive area for young people because the rents
there are much more affordable than in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Other areas she visits are Salt Lake City, where she sees a
``weird punk movement going on,'' as well as London and Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham believes fashion trends will be coming out of
less-traveled places such as South Africa and China, where there is
increased access.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see people getting inspired by accessories from China,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   With the growth of all the Internet technology, Buckingham

cyberspace want to ``counterbalance'' it by wearing fashions that
are or feel custom-made.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is so impersonal,'' she said. ``It is driven by
speed and function. It is not like they are going to walk away from
technology, but there is a real interest in luxury fabrics. There's
an interest in special details, in craftsmanship, in beading.''

   &UR; HAYSUN HAHN, director of Bureau de Style, which tracks trends for a
diverse list of companies, from Escada to Samsung &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Much of the '90s has been about developing a democratic
individual style, mixing a Prada handbag with a tank from Kmart,
for example.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Hahn sees the emergence of a class of ``elite snobs,'' who
buy only the top designer brands and won't dream of mixing status
brands with cheaper ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the absolute design victims. They wear only Prada and
other designs _ even for just comfort,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This trend, she said, started about a year and a half ago, when
some of the top designers, such as Prada, Gucci and Donna Karan,
went after utilitarian looks, serving up $1,000 hooded zip-front
jackets in luxurious cashmere, or rubber-soled shoes that sell for
$270.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, there are the Gucci denim jeans with holes that
retail for more than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, we had an idea that a pair of khaki pants or a
T-shirt had a specific value,'' Hahn said. ``But not any more.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposite of the ``elite snob'' class is what Hahn calls
``the celebrity, media-conscious'' type who prefers glitzier
makeup, bright colors, and wants to look sexy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the big fans of Spice Girls and Jerry Springer's
show,'' she said. ``They are into clothes that make you sexy. They
are not into the design of the clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hahn believes retailers and apparel firms in both of these
categories must take note of this.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to make an instant connection with their consumer in
a much more exclusive, segmented, lifestyle way,'' she said. ``It
is not about buying a designer product and then going to the Gap to
buy your T-shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Retailers catering to the affluent must offer appropriate
services that pamper the customers, she said, while stores that
target those taken in by celebrity need to develop appropriate
partnerships with pop singers and the like.
</P>
<P>
   As for specific trends, Hahn sees a growing importance in
clothes that shape the body, such as the carryalls that wrap around
the body.
</P>
<P>
   She also sees a continued interest in necklines and believes
styles such as cowlnecks will be important over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be about the midriff,'' she said. ``Now, it has
moved up.''

</P>
<P>
   Hilfiger's favorite New York hangouts are Sway, a club on
Greenwich Street, and Nell's, on West 14th Street, which features
hip-hop music on Sunday nights. He believes the connection between
music and fashion will grow even stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year, you will see more and more musicians aligning with
clothing companies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Jeans, which sponsored the Rolling Stones' ``No Security''
tour, has plans to design special stage gear for Britney Spears.
</P>
<P>
   As reported, Tommy Girl, produced under license by Estee
Lauder's Aramis division, is one of the sponsors of the Lilith
Fair.
</P>
<P>
   Hilfiger described the latest music scene, featuring such stars
as Spears, Backstreet Boys and N-Sync who are inspired by R&AMP;B, as
``hip pop.''
</P>
<P>
   As for hip-hop fashions, Hilfiger pointed out that the trend is
not about having a complete baggy look.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is about either having a tight top and a loose bottom, or
vice versa,'' he said. ``The future is mixing a T-shirt with
designer collection pants.''
</P>
<P>
   He also pointed to the trend of mixing athleticwear with
fashion, citing athletic nylon basketball pants with cropped
leather jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Hilfiger believes the fashion industry's interest in the
American rock scene of decades ago is only going to get stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Designers are looking at rock 'n' roll groups of the '60s and
'70s, and recreating it for the '90s,'' he said. &QL;

 By ANNE D'INNOCENZIO 
 c.1999 Fairchild Publications  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Attention, fashion firms that are still showing baggy pants:
Hip-hop style has moved on. Oversized clothes from head to toe are
out.
</P>
<P>
   Try a more tailored look. That's the consensus of four New
York-based trend spotters _ Jane Rinzler Buckingham, president of
Youth Intelligence; Liz DiPilli, director of Project X; Haysun
Hahn, director of Bureau de Style; and Andy Hilfiger, vice
president of public relations for Tommy Jeans _ who were asked what
will be hot over the next two years not only in fashion, but in
music, which is playing an increased role in design inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   These connoisseurs of cool talked about emerging cultural trends
and offered some specifics on where the color palette is heading.
</P>
<P>
   They also indicated that the relentless advance of technology
was a motivating factor in a growing interest in clothes that offer
the kind of craftsmanship associated with a simpler age.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of their predictions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LIZ DIPILLI, Project X, which tracks trends among 14- to
29-year-olds &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DiPilli, whose past and current clients include RJR Reynolds,
Reebok and Conde Nast, said she tracks styles in cities such as New
York, Miami, San Francisco, London and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing a more structured look,'' she said.``This whole
baggy clothes look is fading fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Cargo pants, for example, are getting slimmer. Another trend
DiPilli believes is getting stronger is an interest in handmade
looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fabric bags made in velvet, corduroy or denim are becoming
more important,'' she said. ``Overall, there's an interest in
anything embroidered or anything that has beadwork.''
</P>
<P>
   DiPilli pointed out that consumers' interest in the environment,
together with a continued longing for spirituality, is only going
to get stronger.
</P>
<P>
   She sees an increased interest in world music, whether French,
Afro-Caribbean or Eastern European. Hip-hop, she said, continues to
be a powerful force, but it is starting to break out into different
strains.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's salsa hip-hop, Afro-Caribbean hip-hop,'' she said.
``You will start seeing it further fracture.'' .

   Buckingham scours the streets of New York, as well as college
towns such as Austin, Texas; Boulder, Colo.; Burlington, Vt.; and
Chapel Hill, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   She pointed out that she not only checks out college students
for inspiration, but also recent graduates, who might still be
living in those towns.

increasingly attractive area for young people because the rents
there are much more affordable than in Manhattan.

<P>
   As most newlyweds quickly learn, intimate relationships, even
the most blissful, can buzz with tension.
</P>
<P>
   Couples typically find themselves struggling over money,
in-laws, ex-lovers and how much the woman's placenta should grow
when she gets pregnant. The guy wants his woman to have a
fast-growing placenta, while the woman does all she can to keep it
down to a reasonable size.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the fight over the placenta doesn't exactly take
place out in the open. The average man, if asked what he thinks of
his wife's placenta, would probably say he hasn't given it a
thought. Instead the placenta conflict gets played out, unbeknownst
to either person, inside the woman's body.
</P>
<P>
   A strange genetic process called genomic imprinting is
responsible. And its existence is only one small example of how
males and females have conflicting evolutionary goals.
</P>
<P>
   At first it might seem unlikely that men and women do have
conflicting evolutionary goals. Yes, both mom and dad want their
kid to survive. And in monogamous species, when the father can be
pretty sure it really is his kid, he may well cooperate with the
mother.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not quite the way it is in more polygamous animal
species such as orangutans, nor was it that way, say many
evolutionary biologists, among our own ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   Those males want their offspring to survive at any cost _ even
at the cost of the female's health and future fertility with other
males. For example, if the male can figure out a way to make the
female spend most of her food energy making the offspring grow big
and strong, that's OK, even if she starves. That's where the
struggle over the placenta comes in: men and other male mammals
pass on genes to their unborn children that encourage the mother's
placenta to grow big, nourishing the fetus at the mother's expense.
</P>
<P>
   Females want their offspring to survive too, but not at the risk
of their future fertility.
</P>
<P>
   This conflict is played out viciously among fruit flies.
Drosophila mate with multiple partners, and the male semen contains
toxins that kill the sperm of other males.
</P>
<P>
   When a male fly mates with a female who has recently had sex
with someone else, his spermicide goes to work, killing
competitors' sperm. That's a great adaptation, but unfortunately
the stuff is toxic to the female and gradually harms her health.
</P>
<P>
   The same sort of co-evolutionary arms race happens in humans and
other mammals. As a result, we have developed a bizarre set of
genes called imprinted genes, that seem to violate the basic tenets
of genetics.
</P>
<P>
   Think back to Gregor Mendel, high school biology, and dominant
and recessive traits. According to Mendel, it doesn't matter which
parent contributed which genetic message, but imprinted genes
violate his rules. With these genes, only the gene from one parent
has input _ the matching gene from the other parent is silenced,
losing its influence over the trait expressed.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts in this new field believe that there are only a
couple hundred of these genes in humans.
</P>
<P>
   About half the genes in question have something to do with
growth of the placenta, the fetus or the newborn. And the genes
derived from the father favor greater, faster, more expensive
growth, while the maternally derived genes counter that exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   As the evolutionist David Haig of Harvard first suggested in
1989, imprinted genes, including these genes in humans, are a case
of intersexual competition, fruit-fly sperm wars redux.
</P>
<P>
   The first battleground is the placenta with paternally derived
genes pushing it to invade more aggressively while maternally
derived genes try to hold it back.
</P>
<P>
   In rare diseases, maternal or paternal genes related to
placental growth are knocked out of action. Lose the paternal input
and the antigrowth maternal component is left unopposed _ the
placenta never invades the mother's endometrium, so the fetus has
no chance to grow.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, remove the maternal input, leaving those paternal
genes unopposed, and the placenta grows into a stupendously
aggressive cancer called choriocarcinoma.
</P>
<P>
   Once a baby is born, imprinted genes take a particularly
impressive turn. Certain paternally expressed genes help make kids
active nursers. On the surface, this looks like another example of
the usual picture: faster development at the cost of mom's
lactational calories. But now we're talking about imprinted genes
that influence behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of imprinted genes may pave the way for curing a
number of unpleasant diseases involving tumors, infertility and
fetal overgrowth or underdevelopment. But philosophically, the
findings are disturbing. They appear to have some deflating
implications about human nature. We have more in common with fruit
flies than commonly believed.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent experiment by Rice and evolutionary behaviorist
Brett Holland hints that intersexual competition needn't be
inevitable. With careful manipulation, it can be derailed.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers isolated pairs of mating flies, forcing them to
be monogamous. They then bred the offspring with the offspring of
other such enforced monogamous pairs, continuing to maintain the
monogamy. And after only 40 generations, the monogamous descendants
produced less harmful seminal fluid.
</P>
<P>
   Once competition between males was no longer a selective force,
producing toxic chemicals apparently became a maladaptive waste of
energy. Freed of the cost of intersexual warfare, these monogamous
flies actually outbred the usual competitive flies.
</P>
<P>
   Just imagine carrying out the same experiment in people. Isolate
some humans and force them and their descendants into monogamy for
a millennium, and we would probably begin to disarm our mammalian
weapons of intresexusal warfare, namely imprinted genes.
</P>
<P>
   The story of imprinted genes is a bit more complicated, but once
paternally derived genes began pushing for the-hell-with-the mom
growth, the battle inevitably escalated.
</P>
<P>
   If the tribe next door shows up at the Paleolithic watering hole
with clubs that seem just a wee bit on the big side for the purpose
of bonking prey animals over the head, the home team will naturally
respond by getting even bigger clubs, just in case. And soon we
have a world with choriocarcinoma, toxic fruit-fly semen, and
umpteen times the education budget buying $600 toilet seats for the
military.
</P>
<P>
   As in so many other arenas of conflict, it's easier to ratchet
up than down.

<P>
   Before the Spanish conquest of what is now Colombia, people in
the mountains north of Bogota are said to have thrown emeralds into
Lake Guatavita.
</P>
<P>
   Once a year the Indian ruler would cover himself with honey and
gold dust and at daybreak have his men row him out into the lake.
As he plunged into the water, offering the gold to his god, the
crowd on shore would throw in their own offerings. The rich ones
chucked in emeralds.
</P>
<P>
   When the Spaniards finally found the Indian emerald mines after
decades of bloody searching, the Old World went crazy for the New
World's gems.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Egyptians had begun mining emeralds near the Red
Sea as early as 1650 B.C. _ and emeralds had long been symbols of
immortality, cures for dysentery and preservers of chastity _ the
new Colombian gems were the clearest, biggest and greenest anyone
in Europe had ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Emeralds are valuable because they are rare _ rarer than
diamonds. They are rare, says geologist Alain Cheilletz of the
Center for Petrographic and Geochemical Research in Nancy, France,
because they are a mixture of elements that don't ordinarily get a
chance to mix: ``They are a mineral that shouldn't exist at all.''
</P>
<P>
   An emerald is a type of beryl, a mineral made of beryllium,
aluminum, silicon and oxygen. But whereas ordinary beryls are
colorless, emeralds are green because a few of the aluminum atoms
in their crystal structure have been replaced by atoms of chromium
or vanadium.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of those elements has any reason to meet up with
beryllium; they and it belong to two different chemical families
that drifted apart billions of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Earth was born, a lot of silicon and aluminum rose to
the surface, then cooled, forming the first continents. Most of the
iron stayed behind in the mantle or sank into the planet's core.
Other elements chose one of those two fates, too, based on their
weight and size.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this parting of the elements, Earth's surface rocks
are segregated into two realms, like yang and yin: light and dark,
crust and mantle, continent and ocean bottom. Geologists call the
light minerals felsic and the dark ones mafic.
</P>
<P>
   The paradox of the emeralds, as Cheilletz calls it, is that
beryllium belongs to the light, felsic, continental side, whereas
chromium and vanadium are from the dark, mafic, oceanic side.
Emeralds, in other words, are yin and yang in a single crystal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole problem in our research,'' Cheilletz says, ``was to
figure out the geologic conditions that could permit these two
elements to meet at the same time and place.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, they discovered, has to do with plate tectonics, the
ceaseless shifting of Earth's crust that smashes continents
together to build mountains. To make an emerald, those elements
have to come together in a single hot liquid. The most common place
for it to happen is underneath a young mountain range.
</P>
<P>
   Where the edges of two colliding plates stack up, continental
rocks can get dunked so deep into Earth that they melt again,
liberating a great balloon of magma that rises back through the
crust.
</P>
<P>
   At a depth of around six miles, the magma stops, and begins to
cool and solidify as granite. From the top of this cooling mass,
streams of superhot, mineral-laden water _ granite juice _ migrate
upward into fissures in the surrounding rock and begin to leach out
elements.
</P>
<P>
   ``If by chance the granite happens to hit a zone of mafic rock
incorporated in the continental crust, then the chemistry will be
completely different,'' Cheilletz says. ``It will include iron,
magnesium and calcium _ and traces of chromium and vanadium.''
</P>
<P>
   When the felsic-mafic mixture finally freezes, the fissure will
be filled with biotite, a kind of mica. But scattered through the
mica, like green snowflakes, may be emeralds.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the world's known emerald deposits, from the
3-billion-year-old ones in South Africa to the 9-million-year-old
ones in Pakistan, were formed by granite intrusions.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Cheilletz and his colleague Gaston Giuliani went
to Colombia to have a look at the most renowned emerald mines _ and
soon saw they didn't fit the standard picture.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of granites intruding from below, in Colombia there are
black shales laid down from above _ sedimentary rocks deposited on
the floor of a shallow inland sea during the Cretaceous Period, 100
million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The sea must have been shallow, because the shales are
sandwiched among layers of salt, which precipitated out of the
water at times when it had all but evaporated. The Colombian shales
contain, in dispersed form, all the ingredients of emeralds.
</P>
<P>
   According to Giuliani and Cheilletz, those ingredients came
together on two distinct occasions, 65 million and 38 million years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Surges in plate motions _ the Atlantic Ocean was getting wider,
pushing South America against the Pacific and raising the Andes _
caused the thick stack of sediments under the shallow sea to
buckle.
</P>
<P>
   Large sloping faults formed several miles down in the sediments,
and hot water was squeezed out of them. Rising through layers of
salt, the 570-degree water became extremely corrosive. Continuing
through layers of shale, it dissolved out the emerald ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Finally it pooled under a layer of especially impermeable shale
until the pressure became great enough to shatter that layer
explosively.
</P>
<P>
   Then the hot solution shot up through empty cracks in the rock.
As its temperature and pressure plummeted, emerald crystals snowed
out of it immediately. It all happened so fast, says Giuliani, that
the emeralds had no time to grow around grains in the surrounding
shale. They grew unconstrained and pure, without the minerals that
often cloud emeralds found in other parts of the world. That is why
Europeans were so enraptured with the Colombian stones when they
first laid eyes on them in the 16th century.

   The paradox of the emeralds, as Cheilletz calls it, is that
beryllium belongs to the light, felsic, continental side, whereas
chromium and vanadium are from the dark, mafic, oceanic side.
Emeralds, in other words, are yin and yang in a single crystal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole problem in our research,'' Cheilletz says, ``was to
figure out the geologic conditions that could permit these two
elements to meet at the same time and place.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, they discovered, has to do with plate tectonics, the
ceaseless shifting of Earth's crust that smashes continents
together to build mountains. To make an emerald, those elements
have to come together in a single hot liquid. The most common place
for it to happen is underneath a young mountain range.
</P>
<P>
   Where the edges of two colliding plates stack up, continental
rocks can get dunked so deep into Earth that they melt again,
liberating a great balloon of magma that rises back through the
crust.
</P>
<P>
   At a depth of around six miles, the magma stops, and begins to
cool and solidify as granite. From the top of this cooling mass,
streams of superhot, mineral-laden water _ granite juice _ migrate
upward into fissures in the surrounding rock and begin to leach out
elements.
</P>
<P>
   ``If by chance the granite happens to hit a zone of mafic rock
incorporated in the continental crust, then the chemistry will be
completely different,'' Cheilletz says. ``It will include iron,
magnesium and calcium _ and traces of chromium and vanadium.''
</P>
<P>
   When the felsic-mafic mixture finally freezes, the fissure will
be filled with biotite, a kind of mica. But scattered through the
mica, like green snowflakes, may be emeralds.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the world's known emerald deposits, from the
3-billion-year-old ones in South Africa to the 9-million-year-old
ones in Pakistan, were formed by granite intrusions.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Cheilletz and his colleague Gaston Giuliani went
to Colombia to have a look at the most renowned emerald mines _ and
soon saw they didn't fit the standard picture.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of granites intruding from below, in Colombia there are
black shales laid down from above _ sedimentary rocks deposited on
the floor of a shallow inland sea during the Cretaceous Period, 100
million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The sea must have been shallow, because the shales are
sandwiched among layers of salt, which precipitated out of the
water at times when it had all but evaporated. The Colombian shales
contain, in dispersed form, all the ingredients of emeralds.
</P>
<P>
   According to Giuliani and Cheilletz, those ingredients came
together on two distinct occasions, 65 million and 38 million years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Surges in plate motions _ the Atlantic Ocean was getting wider,
pushing South America against the Pacific and raising the Andes _
caused the thick stack of sediments under the shallow sea to
buckle.
</P>
<P>
   Large sloping faults formed several miles down in the sediments,
and hot water was squeezed out of them. Rising through layers of
salt, the 570-degree water became extremely corrosive. Continuing
through layers of shale, it dissolved out the emerald ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Finally it pooled under a layer of especially impermeable shale
until the pressure became great enough to shatter that layer
explosively.
</P>
<P>
   Then the hot solution shot up through empty cracks in the rock.
As its temperature and pressure plummeted, emerald crystals snowed
out of it immediately. It all happened so fast, says Giuliani, that
the emeralds had no time to grow around grains in the surrounding
shale. They grew unconstrained and pure, without the minerals that
often cloud emeralds found in other parts of the world. That is why
Europeans were so enraptured with the Colombian stones when they
first laid eyes on them in the 16th century.

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Aglow with civic ardor
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton has formed an exploratory committee. Every
candidate forms exploratory committees these days. Mrs. Clinton's
exploratory committee will advise her whether to run for U.S.
Senate in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The committee will tell her it's OK. When was the last time you
saw an exploratory committee say the mere idea is a nightmare?
Exploratory committees, in their simplicity, want to give their
hearts away.
</P>
<P>
   As a candidate, you can't let them. You've got to think where
uncomplicated ardor might lead, like imprudence. A candidate cannot
be seen virtually adrool for public office. A candidate is to be
summoned from private life by citizens driven by civic interest.
Then, having heard their plea, you can announce your candidacy
three or four times without the press keeping count.
</P>
<P>
   The press, flighty as ever, will have turned its attention to
thinking up trick questions. In Mrs. Clinton's case, what was Pee
Wee Reese's uniform number? A: 1. Where is Mark Twain buried? A:
Elmira. Do you like your corned beef sandwich on rye or white? A:
Rye _ with mustard.
</P>
<P>
   Shows you're serious.

 &HT;    Advice that's simply timeless
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ One of my favorite pieces of reading material
is a raggedy little paperback book I keep in the desk drawer next
to the stationery. It's titled: ``The Standard Cyclopaedia of
Useful Knowledge.'' This November, 1896 issue sold for 25 cents but
subscriptions to the publisher, F.M. Lupton of 23, 25, and 27 City
Hall Place, New York, for $2.60 per year were encouraged. When life
needs simplifying, I pull it out and read.
</P>
<P>
   This issue's chapters under the heading: ``The Household, are a
wealth of recipes, how-to hints, and generally useful stuff.
Cooking Recipes, Ladies' Fancy Work, Floriculture, The Home
Physician, The Toilet, The Laundry, and Hints and Helps'' _ it's
all there.
</P>
<P>
   In our throw-away society, hints like how to clean ribbons kind
of warm the cockles of a simple heart. Try this: ``Take one
tablespoonful of brandy, one of soft soap, and one of molasses. Mix
thoroughly together; place the ribbon upon a smooth board, and
apply the mixture with a soft brush; after which rinse in cold
water, and roll up in a cloth until nearly dry. Iron with a
flat-iron, not too hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Unpleasant Odor from Cabbage: ``The reason why cabbage emits
such a disagreeable smell when boiling is because the process
dissolves the essential oil. The water should be changed when the
cabbage is half-boiled, and it will thus acquire a greater
sweetness.''
</P>
<P>
   Dirty diamonds? ``Nicely wash in soap-suds, rinse in alcohol,
and dry in sawdust; then brush with a soft brush, and polish with
fine tissue paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Pimples a problem? ``Wash the face twice a day in warm water and
rub dry with a coarse towel. Then with a soft towel rub in a lotion
made of two ounces of white brandy, one ounce of cologne, and one
half ounce of liquor potassa. Persons subject to skin eruptions
should avoid very salt or fat food. A dose of Epsom salts
occasionally might prove beneficial.''
</P>
<P>
   Or how about blending your own toothpowder? ``Ten cents' worth
ground chalk, five cents' worth orris root, five cents' worth
myrrh, one teaspoonful powdered castile soap. Mix well together and
it will prove an admirable cleanser.''
</P>
<P>
   The Home Physician offers a cure for bunions: ``Let fall a
stream of very warm water from a teakettle, at the highest
elevation from which the patient can bear the water to fall
directly on the apex of the swelling; continue this once a day for
a short time and a cure will be effected, providing you desist from
wearing short shoes. The greater the elevation of the kettle, the
more effectual the remedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco Antidote: ``Two or more ounces of gentian root, coarsely
ground. Take as much of it after each meal as amounts to a common
quid of 'fine cut'. Chew it slowly and swallow the juice. Continue
this a few weeks and you will conquer the insatiable appetite for
tobacco, which injures both mind and body, and from which thousands
struggle to be free, but give up in despair.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally, my favorite, Table Etiquette: ``There is nothing so
disagreeable as careless and untidy table manners; and to acquire
graceful and pleasing habits while eating sometimes takes years of
practice. But it can be done...sit down and think how you really
behave at the table. Are your hands and nails and face clean, and
hair brushed back smoothly? Do you seat yourself quietly and
remember to put on your napkin? Do you sometimes put your knife in
your mouth, instead of a fork or a spoon? Do you pour your tea in
your saucer instead of drinking from the cup? Do you reach over
another's plate...do you eat fast and loud and put large pieces in
your mouth or speak with food unchewed, or pick your teeth?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I hope none of these, for any one of them would make you
appear impolite and uncultivated. Do you remember not to whisper,
yawn, or stretch, touch your hair, or blow the nose? Do you spit
cherry pits on the plate? Remember courtesy at the table is
indispensable and if you practice it at home, you will not have to
put it on when you are away.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week, ``How People Get Sick'' plus multiple cures for the
common cold.

 &HT;    SEC chief offers Web horse sense
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt
talked recently about electronic investing in the next century, he
summoned up the old-fashioned wisdom of folk singer Pete Seeger:
``Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you
get when you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   His point was that successful investing will always require
detailed and demanding study.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ease and speed of the Internet have made trading _ not
investing, but trading _ easier than ever before,'' he said. ``But
in no way does it absolve investors of their basic responsibilities
to invest in a way that is consistent with their goals and risk
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Levitt was speaking to a crowd of 6,000 at the Los Angeles
Times' annual investment conference. He pointed out that nobody at
all traded on the Internet before 1994. Now an estimated 10 million
investors buy and sell stocks electronically.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day, I was driving behind a bus that advertised a
financial Web site,'' he said. ``I remember when buses used to
advertise the local newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt, now in his second term as boss of the federal
government's chief watchdog over the investment markets, draws
mixed reactions from people who care about his work.
</P>
<P>
   Some market insiders _ meaning the industry leaders who make the
big bucks _ admire his work. But one market official fumed in a
trade publication that Levitt's SEC has gone from tinkering to
``full-on socialism.''
</P>
<P>
   Among investors and their partisans, the range of opinion is
just about that wide. Some complain that Levitt talks a good game
but tilts toward serving the industry before the public.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he is a first-rate teacher, and he was a big hit in Los
Angeles, dropping down from the suited elegance of a big-time
market professional to the shirt-sleeve level of everyday
investors.
</P>
<P>
   He talked about using old-fashioned horse sense in the 21st
century marketplace. Here are some of his tips:
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't assume your buy and sell orders are executed instantly.
``The process is usually seamless and electronic,'' Levitt said.
``It is not, however, guaranteed. Lines may clog, systems may
break, orders may back up.''
</P>
<P>
   That's especially worrisome when everybody wants to buy or sell
a company's stock at the same time. To protect themselves,
investors should consider a limit order. It directs your broker,
human or electronic, to buy or sell only at the price you specify.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't assume your order is canceled when you hit the
``cancel'' button. It's executed only when it gets to the market.
In one recent case, Levitt said, a major brokerage couldn't process
20 percent of its cancellation orders on a fast-breaking initial
public offering.
</P>
<P>
   One customer later told regulators she canceled an order to buy
2,000 shares, then placed a second order for 1,000 shares. She
wanted to invest about $18,000, Levitt said, but she ended up owing
her broker more than $250,000 for 3,000 shares. ``I urge you to
contact your firms to see how they can ensure a cancellation order
actually worked,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do your homework.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest mistake investors make is that they invest
emotionally,'' Levitt told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   He recommended, for starters, reading corporate annual reports
and mutual fund prospectuses. He pointed out _ no surprise _ that
the SEC itself provides much more information on its own Web site,
www.sec.gov.
</P>
<P>
   A major attraction there is EDGAR, the commission's humongous
database. It gives investors ready access to the last five years of
filings by most public companies.
</P>
<P>
   You can find, among many other things, whether a company's
auditors have spotted any problems, whether officers and directors
have chosen to buy stock in the company and whether insiders are
buying or selling. It's a treasure trove.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask your broker exactly how he or she is paid. Often the
biggest commissions are paid for selling favored stocks or the
mutual funds operated by the brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the government's job to decide how brokers should be
paid,'' Levitt said. ``But I personally think it is wrong for a
brokerage to pay a higher fee for selling its own in-house
securities. The better firms are stopping this practice.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't fall for old scams in new packages. ``Just recently, the
SEC took action against an individual who told investors through
his Web site that a tax-free island would emerge from the sea floor
of the Caribbean,'' Levitt recounted. ``He sold so-called New
Utopia `government' bonds promising returns of 200 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web site had gotten more than 100,000 hits before the SEC
stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember the cardinal rule of investing: If it sounds too good
to be true, it probably isn't true. Let me add another one here
today. If it sounds crazy, it almost definitely is.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Be very cautious about stock tips gleaned from Internet chat
rooms. Too often, the tipster has an interest in the stock, or is a
con artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chat rooms have been compared to a high-tech version of
morning gossip or advice at the company water cooler,'' Levitt
said. ``But at least you knew your co-workers at the water
cooler.''

<P>
   He recommended, for starters, reading corporate annual reports
and mutual fund prospectuses. He pointed out _ no surprise _ that
the SEC itself provides much more information on its own Web site,
www.sec.gov.
</P>
<P>
   A major attraction there is EDGAR, the commission's humongous
database. It gives investors ready access to the last five years of
filings by most public companies.
</P>
<P>
   You can find, among many other things, whether a company's
auditors have spotted any problems, whether officers and directors
have chosen to buy stock in the company and whether insiders are
buying or selling. It's a treasure trove.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask your broker exactly how he or she is paid. Often the
biggest commissions are paid for selling favored stocks or the
mutual funds operated by the brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the government's job to decide how brokers should be
paid,'' Levitt said. ``But I personally think it is wrong for a
brokerage to pay a higher fee for selling its own in-house
securities. The better firms are stopping this practice.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't fall for old scams in new packages. ``Just recently, the
SEC took action against an individual who told investors through
his Web site that a tax-free island would emerge from the sea floor
of the Caribbean,'' Levitt recounted. ``He sold so-called New
Utopia `government' bonds promising returns of 200 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web site had gotten more than 100,000 hits before the SEC
stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember the cardinal rule of investing: If it sounds too good
to be true, it probably isn't true. Let me add another one here
today. If it sounds crazy, it almost definitely is.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Be very cautious about stock tips gleaned from Internet chat
rooms. Too often, the tipster has an interest in the stock, or is a
con artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chat rooms have been compared to a high-tech version of
morning gossip or advice at the company water cooler,'' Levitt
said. ``But at least you knew your co-workers at the water
cooler.''

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Infant siblings gain comfort, health benefits
from `co-bedding'
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The baby triplets clearly don't like being apart.
When one of them is left alone in the bed they all share, it won't
be long before she'll start moving around and fussing. She seems to
be reaching out for her sisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always have to be touching each other, and they'll
smile,'' says their mother, April Lenz. ``When you look at them
together, you can just see the peace that they have.''
</P>
<P>
   The limited research on premature babies who share a bed with
their siblings suggests it's more than just comforting to stay
close with their buddies from the womb as soon as practical after
birth. They also gain weight faster, begin maintaining body heat
earlier and nurse sooner on more nutritious breast milk, says Linda
Lutes, an infant-development specialist and the country's foremost
advocate of what she calls co-bedding.
</P>
<P>
   It all makes sense, certainly. They stay warmer together, and if
the companionship keeps them calmer, Lutes says, ``they'll sleep
for longer periods of time so they're able to grow more.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, twins, triplets and other multiple-birth babies can
leave the hospital sooner. That has been the experience at the
Children's Medical Center in the year it has been co-bedding. It
costs less, the babies are healthier and everybody's happier.
``Nobody likes their baby to cry,'' Lutes says.
</P>
<P>
   So why is this such a new concept? Swedish hospitals have been
bunking multiples together as soon as they can breathe on their own
for more than a generation, but Lutes began introducing the idea to
this country only eight or nine years ago, and other Western
countries were even slower to start.
</P>
<P>
   There have been two main concerns, which still prevail in many
newborn intensive-care units. One is that it would be too easy to
mix up the babies' medications if they were in the same bed. The
other is that the close proximity would make them more susceptible
to infection, which is especially dangerous for a preemie.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy enough to keep the medications straight by
color-coding everything, Lutes says, and it's turning out that
preemies who share a bed have a lower infection rate ``because
everybody is so careful.'' Which leaves one other obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't sure if this works,'' Lutes says. She
understands that. Doctors don't tend to take anything on faith, and
there isn't much scientific data from her three years of research.
The first study, at Good Samaritan Hospital in Cincinnati, simply
showed sharing beds wasn't harmful. The second study established
success in growth rates, body heat and breast-feeding, but it
involved only seven sets of pre-term twins in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest question is how early it's safe to put the preemies
in the same bed. Lutes says as soon as they're breathing without a
ventilator and don't have a catheter in the umbilical line, which
could cause serious bleeding if it came loose.
</P>
<P>
   Bethany and Becca were sharing a bed without Brittany five days
after they were born April 2, at 10 weeks premature, each within
three ounces of three pounds. Brittany, the smallest, joined them
11 days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``They suck on each other's fingers,'' Lenz says. ``That was the
first time one of them nursed, when Brittany had put one of her
fingers in Becca's mouth so she was already sucking.''
</P>
<P>
   Lenz and her husband, Jeff, had decided to bed their babies
together at home simply because their Springfield, Ohio house
wasn't designed for the five children they now have. But they were
planning to put some sort of dividers in the crib ``so it would be
like three little beds,'' she says, until someone gave her a book
that told about bedding triplets together.
</P>
<P>
   In the hospital, the babies were snuggled tightly at first in
one blanket, their hands free to touch each other's faces and
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you do that, they immediately will hold hands and embrace
and then go to sleep,'' Lutes says. ``Within five minutes, if you
look at their monitors, their heart rates and breathing rates will
be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Multiple-birth babies simply develop differently, she says. Even
if they don't share the same sac in the uterus, they touch each
other constantly. Lutes has seen ultrasound images of one fetus
appearing upset and the twin sister offering her thumb to suck, or
stroking his face or holding his foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one of them gets the hiccups, all three get the hiccups,''
Lenz says of her babies. ``If one monitor goes off, all three go
off. It's uncanny. One time they were checking the babies' eyes and
before they got to the third one, she was covering her eyes. They
say triplets can feel each other's pain, and it's just amazing to
watch how that works.''
</P>
<P>
   Lutes started figuring this out as a grade-school teacher where
she lives in suburban Oklahoma City. It used to be automatic that
twins were assigned to separate classrooms, but Lutes started
arranging with other teachers to bring both twins into the hallway
for a few minutes if one was having a bad day.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't take much. Maybe the upset one would get a hug or a
back scratching or an empathetic look or even a quick
``get-a-grip'' lecture. The other twin always knew what to do,
``and it would just turn their day around,'' Lutes says.
</P>
<P>
   Now 44, she eventually taught sick kids in hospitals, and bed
sharing made even more sense to her. ``There was a time when they
did it, but only when the babies were about ready to go home,'' she
says. Now she hears from hospitals across the country and in much
of Europe that want to start co-bedding earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The children often stay in the same bed until kindergarten or
first grade, she says, but even after that, they're likely to go
back to share a bed again on the night before something exciting or
stressful, from Christmas to the first day of school.
</P>
<P>
   As infants, one of the best things for the Lenz parents is that
they can spend time with all their babies at once. ``I don't have
to count the minutes I spend at each bedside,'' their mother said.
</P>
<P>
   The triplets went home May 21, all of them together even though
Brittany still needed to be hooked up to a monitor. Separating them
at that point wasn't even an option, April says.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been together for so long. We can't always be there.
The nurses change. But they don't. They're the only consistency in
each other's lives.''

   YUPPIE-HOAX (San Francisco) _ A San Francisco weekly newspaper
gleefully admits to fabricating a news event and tricking major
media outlets, including the San Francisco Examiner, into covering

beginner's advice from Dan Goldie: Forget that sizzling start-up

 &UR; FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES &QL; 
 &UR; By BARBARA WHITAKER &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   It can be slow getting through Houston traffic to the Bayou Bend
Collection and Gardens. But in a way, that only increases the
pleasure of arriving at the home of the city's celebrated
philanthropist.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of Westcott Street, a short drive west of town that
leads from Memorial Drive to the estate's parking lot, is a small
suspension footbridge.
</P>
<P>
   Even on a warm day this spring it felt at least 10 degrees
cooler on the bridge as the wind rippled through the trees that
encircle the home built for Ima Hogg and two of her brothers in the
1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Although her name tends to bring a smirk when heard for the
first time, her achievement is no laughing matter. Daughter of
James Stephen Hogg, Texas' first native-born Governor and a member
of a prominent Texas family, Miss Hogg _ who died in 1975 at the
age of 93 _ put 55 years into building a collection of American art
and antiques that spans two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally, she intended to collect furniture to give to a
museum in Texas, which was rather farsighted because when she
started collecting, there wasn't a museum in Texas,'' said David B.
Warren, director of Bayou Bend, which Miss Hogg deeded to the
city's Museum of Fine Arts in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   She explained her goal saying, ``I hope in a modest way Bayou
Bend may serve as a bridge to bring us closer to the heart of an
American heritage which unites us.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Miss Hogg was modest in her hopes, she was not in her
collecting (more than 4,800 American decorative items) or her home,
a pink (she loved pink) stucco mansion, one of the first to be
built in River Oaks, Houston's premier neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The house, surrounded by 14 acres of woods, lawns and gardens,
evokes the homes of the Old South. She referred to the architecture
as Latin Colonial, a style that recalled Louisiana and the Gulf
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Constructed in 1927 by the well-known Houston architect John F.
Staub, it gets its name from Buffalo Bayou, which winds around
three sides of the property.
</P>
<P>
   While she filled her home with a vast collection of American
antiques, Miss Hogg surrounded it with eight distinctive gardens,
several of which feature an astonishing array of pink azaleas and
camellias.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most striking are the formal Clio Garden, named for
the statue of the muse of History that sits at its center, and the
newly rehabilitated Diana Garden, a formal garden of azaleas,
magnolias and hedges dominated by a statue of Diana, which provides
an impressive backdrop looking from the back of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Others range from the white garden, planted in deep ravines that
cut through the estate, to the butterfly garden, named for its
shape and planted with vintage camellias and azaleas, to a topiary
garden.
</P>
<P>
   It is worth a visit to Bayou Bend simply to stroll through the
grounds. People with small children may have to do just that since
those under the age of 10 are not admitted on the house tours,
which are limited to six.
</P>
<P>
   Led by well-informed docents, the tours take visitors through
the two floors of the house into 28 separate areas dedicated to
tracing the evolution of style in America from Colonial days to the
Victorian era.
</P>
<P>
   Each docent, a museum-trained volunteer, provides an individual
touch, going beyond telling visitors what they're looking at, to
discuss how history influenced the furnishings and decorative arts
from each period.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Pine Room, a paneled former library with a bay
window, fireplace and two John Smibert portraits, is described as
typifying the Baroque period; a variety of chairs in the room _
William and Mary to Queen Anne _ are used to trace an emerging
Asian influence on furnishing styles.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the change, visitors learn, is that when Charles
II became King of England, he married a Portuguese princess, which
opened doors to trade in Asia. (Much of American furniture at this
time was still heavily influenced by English styles.)
</P>
<P>
   Miss Hogg started her collection with a simple maple chair made
in New England in the mid-1700's, purchased in 1920 from Collings &AMP;
Collings in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights of the museum are a Queen Anne japanned
high chest, circa 1730-1760, one of a handful existing today; a
Newport block front desk and bookcase, one of 11 existing, and the
only John Henry Belter parlor set _ a highly ornate Rococo Revival
suite of two armchairs, two side chairs and a sofa in laminated and
carved rosewood _ with an original bill of sale.
</P>
<P>
   It is also fun to look at some of the more whimsical items, such
as Staffordshire transferware plates commemorating various
historical events, or a 1758 blue and white delft English ceramic
punch bowl with the words ``Fill the Other Bowl Boys'' painted in
underglaze blue on the inside bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Bayou Bend, which depends primarily on donations for
acquisitions, continues to add to the collection, this year
purchasing a pre-Revolutionary Charleston great chair, the earliest
piece of Charleston furniture known to exist.
</P>
<P>
   Another recent purchase is a Chinese porcelain stand, such as a
gravy boat might be set on, from George Washington's personal china
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't under the bell jar,'' Mr. Warren said of the
collection, ``so it definitely continues to grow and improve.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, does the Museum of Fine Arts continue to expand its
decorative arts collection. On May 1, the museum opened Rienzi to
the public. This River Oaks estate features 18th-and 19th-century
European furniture, paintings, precious metals and objets d'art. It
is just minutes from Bayou Bend.
</P>
<P>
   House tours, gardens, plus a detour worth a stop
</P>
<P>
   Bayou Bend, at 1 Westcott, (713) 639-7750, is 10 to 15 minutes
from downtown Houston. There is a story with every room, and guided
tours are offered Tuesday through Friday; hours vary. It's best to
call for reservations (a week or two in advance during the school
year).
</P>
<P>
   On weekends, there are self-guided audio tours only, also open
to children, from 1 to 5 p.m. (third Sunday of the month free,
unless special events are scheduled); only audio tours offered in
August. Admission: $10 for tours of the house and gardens; $5 for
ages 10 to 18; under 10, free; $3 for the gardens only.
</P>
<P>
   Rienzi, with its fine collection of 18th- and 19th-century
European decorative arts, is less than a mile from Bayou Bend, at
1406 Kirby Drive. Open Monday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday from
10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; Sundays 1 to 5 p.m.; guided tours only (by
reservation). Admission $6; children allowed Sunday only.
Reservations: (713) 639-7800.

 &UR; FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES &QL; 
 &UR; By BARBARA WHITAKER &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   It can be slow getting through Houston traffic to the Bayou Bend
Collection and Gardens. But in a way, that only increases the
pleasure of arriving at the home of the city's celebrated
philanthropist.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of Westcott Street, a short drive west of town that
leads from Memorial Drive to the estate's parking lot, is a small
suspension footbridge.
</P>
<P>
   Even on a warm day this spring it felt at least 10 degrees
cooler on the bridge as the wind rippled through the trees that
encircle the home built for Ima Hogg and two of her brothers in the
1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Although her name tends to bring a smirk when heard for the
first time, her achievement is no laughing matter. Daughter of
James Stephen Hogg, Texas' first native-born Governor and a member
of a prominent Texas family, Miss Hogg _ who died in 1975 at the
age of 93 _ put 55 years into building a collection of American art
and antiques that spans two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally, she intended to collect furniture to give to a
museum in Texas, which was rather farsighted because when she
started collecting, there wasn't a museum in Texas,'' said David B.
Warren, director of Bayou Bend, which Miss Hogg deeded to the
city's Museum of Fine Arts in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   She explained her goal saying, ``I hope in a modest way Bayou
Bend may serve as a bridge to bring us closer to the heart of an
American heritage which unites us.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Miss Hogg was modest in her hopes, she was not in her
collecting (more than 4,800 American decorative items) or her home,
a pink (she loved pink) stucco mansion, one of the first to be
built in River Oaks, Houston's premier neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The house, surrounded by 14 acres of woods, lawns and gardens,
evokes the homes of the Old South. She referred to the architecture
as Latin Colonial, a style that recalled Louisiana and the Gulf
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Constructed in 1927 by the well-known Houston architect John F.
Staub, it gets its name from Buffalo Bayou, which winds around
three sides of the property.
</P>
<P>
   While she filled her home with a vast collection of American
antiques, Miss Hogg surrounded it with eight distinctive gardens,
several of which feature an astonishing array of pink azaleas and
camellias.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most striking are the formal Clio Garden, named for
the statue of the muse of History that sits at its center, and the
newly rehabilitated Diana Garden, a formal garden of azaleas,
magnolias and hedges dominated by a statue of Diana, which provides
an impressive backdrop looking from the back of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Others range from the white garden, planted in deep ravines that
cut through the estate, to the butterfly garden, named for its
shape and planted with vintage camellias and azaleas, to a topiary
garden.
</P>
<P>
   It is worth a visit to Bayou Bend simply to stroll through the
grounds. People with small children may have to do just that since
those under the age of 10 are not admitted on the house tours,
which are limited to six.
</P>
<P>
   Led by well-informed docents, the tours take visitors through
the two floors of the house into 28 separate areas dedicated to
tracing the evolution of style in America from Colonial days to the
Victorian era.
</P>
<P>
   Each docent, a museum-trained volunteer, provides an individual
touch, going beyond telling visitors what they're looking at, to
discuss how history influenced the furnishings and decorative arts
from each period.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Pine Room, a paneled former library with a bay
window, fireplace and two John Smibert portraits, is described as
typifying the Baroque period; a variety of chairs in the room _
William and Mary to Queen Anne _ are used to trace an emerging
Asian influence on furnishing styles.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the change, visitors learn, is that when Charles
II became King of England, he married a Portuguese princess, which
opened doors to trade in Asia. (Much of American furniture at this
time was still heavily influenced by English styles.)
</P>
<P>
   Miss Hogg started her collection with a simple maple chair made
in New England in the mid-1700's, purchased in 1920 from Collings &AMP;
Collings in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights of the museum are a Queen Anne japanned
high chest, circa 1730-1760, one of a handful existing today; a
Newport block front desk and bookcase, one of 11 existing, and the
only John Henry Belter parlor set _ a highly ornate Rococo Revival
suite of two armchairs, two side chairs and a sofa in laminated and
carved rosewood _ with an original bill of sale.
</P>
<P>
   It is also fun to look at some of the more whimsical items, such
as Staffordshire transferware plates commemorating various
historical events, or a 1758 blue and white delft English ceramic
punch bowl with the words ``Fill the Other Bowl Boys'' painted in
underglaze blue on the inside bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Bayou Bend, which depends primarily on donations for
acquisitions, continues to add to the collection, this year
purchasing a pre-Revolutionary Charleston great chair, the earliest
piece of Charleston furniture known to exist.
</P>
<P>
   Another recent purchase is a Chinese porcelain stand, such as a
gravy boat might be set on, from George Washington's personal china
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't under the bell jar,'' Mr. Warren said of the
collection, ``so it definitely continues to grow and improve.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, does the Museum of Fine Arts continue to expand its
decorative arts collection. On May 1, the museum opened Rienzi to
the public. This River Oaks estate features 18th-and 19th-century
European furniture, paintings, precious metals and objets d'art. It
is just minutes from Bayou Bend.
</P>
<P>
   House tours, gardens, plus a detour worth a stop
</P>
<P>
   Bayou Bend, at 1 Westcott, (713) 639-7750, is 10 to 15 minutes
from downtown Houston. There is a story with every room, and guided
tours are offered Tuesday through Friday; hours vary. It's best to
call for reservations (a week or two in advance during the school
year).
</P>
<P>
   On weekends, there are self-guided audio tours only, also open
to children, from 1 to 5 p.m. (third Sunday of the month free,
unless special events are scheduled); only audio tours offered in
August. Admission: $10 for tours of the house and gardens; $5 for

</P>
<P>
   It can be slow getting through Houston traffic to the Bayou Bend
Collection and Gardens. But in a way, that only increases the
pleasure of arriving at the home of the city's celebrated
philanthropist.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of Westcott Street, a short drive west of town that
leads from Memorial Drive to the estate's parking lot, is a small
suspension footbridge.
</P>
<P>
   Even on a warm day this spring it felt at least 10 degrees
cooler on the bridge as the wind rippled through the trees that
encircle the home built for Ima Hogg and two of her brothers in the
1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Although her name tends to bring a smirk when heard for the
first time, her achievement is no laughing matter. Daughter of
James Stephen Hogg, Texas' first native-born Governor and a member
of a prominent Texas family, Miss Hogg _ who died in 1975 at the
age of 93 _ put 55 years into building a collection of American art
and antiques that spans two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally, she intended to collect furniture to give to a
museum in Texas, which was rather farsighted because when she
started collecting, there wasn't a museum in Texas,'' said David B.
Warren, director of Bayou Bend, which Miss Hogg deeded to the
city's Museum of Fine Arts in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   She explained her goal saying, ``I hope in a modest way Bayou
Bend may serve as a bridge to bring us closer to the heart of an
American heritage which unites us.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Miss Hogg was modest in her hopes, she was not in her
collecting (more than 4,800 American decorative items) or her home,
a pink (she loved pink) stucco mansion, one of the first to be
built in River Oaks, Houston's premier neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The house, surrounded by 14 acres of woods, lawns and gardens,
evokes the homes of the Old South. She referred to the architecture
as Latin Colonial, a style that recalled Louisiana and the Gulf
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Constructed in 1927 by the well-known Houston architect John F.
Staub, it gets its name from Buffalo Bayou, which winds around
three sides of the property.
</P>
<P>
   While she filled her home with a vast collection of American
antiques, Miss Hogg surrounded it with eight distinctive gardens,
several of which feature an astonishing array of pink azaleas and
camellias.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most striking are the formal Clio Garden, named for
the statue of the muse of History that sits at its center, and the
newly rehabilitated Diana Garden, a formal garden of azaleas,
magnolias and hedges dominated by a statue of Diana, which provides
an impressive backdrop looking from the back of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Others range from the white garden, planted in deep ravines that
cut through the estate, to the butterfly garden, named for its
shape and planted with vintage camellias and azaleas, to a topiary
garden.
</P>
<P>
   It is worth a visit to Bayou Bend simply to stroll through the
grounds. People with small children may have to do just that since
those under the age of 10 are not admitted on the house tours,
which are limited to six.
</P>
<P>
   Led by well-informed docents, the tours take visitors through
the two floors of the house into 28 separate areas dedicated to
tracing the evolution of style in America from Colonial days to the
Victorian era.
</P>
<P>
   Each docent, a museum-trained volunteer, provides an individual
touch, going beyond telling visitors what they're looking at, to
discuss how history influenced the furnishings and decorative arts
from each period.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Pine Room, a paneled former library with a bay
window, fireplace and two John Smibert portraits, is described as
typifying the Baroque period; a variety of chairs in the room _
William and Mary to Queen Anne _ are used to trace an emerging
Asian influence on furnishing styles.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the change, visitors learn, is that when Charles
II became King of England, he married a Portuguese princess, which
opened doors to trade in Asia. (Much of American furniture at this
time was still heavily influenced by English styles.)
</P>
<P>
   Miss Hogg started her collection with a simple maple chair made
in New England in the mid-1700's, purchased in 1920 from Collings &AMP;
Collings in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights of the museum are a Queen Anne japanned
high chest, circa 1730-1760, one of a handful existing today; a
Newport block front desk and bookcase, one of 11 existing, and the
only John Henry Belter parlor set _ a highly ornate Rococo Revival
suite of two armchairs, two side chairs and a sofa in laminated and
carved rosewood _ with an original bill of sale.
</P>
<P>
   It is also fun to look at some of the more whimsical items, such
as Staffordshire transferware plates commemorating various
historical events, or a 1758 blue and white delft English ceramic
punch bowl with the words ``Fill the Other Bowl Boys'' painted in
underglaze blue on the inside bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Bayou Bend, which depends primarily on donations for
acquisitions, continues to add to the collection, this year
purchasing a pre-Revolutionary Charleston great chair, the earliest
piece of Charleston furniture known to exist.
</P>
<P>
   Another recent purchase is a Chinese porcelain stand, such as a
gravy boat might be set on, from George Washington's personal china
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't under the bell jar,'' Mr. Warren said of the
collection, ``so it definitely continues to grow and improve.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, does the Museum of Fine Arts continue to expand its
decorative arts collection. On May 1, the museum opened Rienzi to
the public. This River Oaks estate features 18th-and 19th-century
European furniture, paintings, precious metals and objets d'art. It
is just minutes from Bayou Bend.
</P>
<P>
   House tours, gardens, plus a detour worth a stop
</P>
<P>
   Bayou Bend, at 1 Westcott, (713) 639-7750, is 10 to 15 minutes
from downtown Houston. There is a story with every room, and guided
tours are offered Tuesday through Friday; hours vary. It's best to
call for reservations (a week or two in advance during the school
year).
</P>
<P>
   On weekends, there are self-guided audio tours only, also open
to children, from 1 to 5 p.m. (third Sunday of the month free,
unless special events are scheduled); only audio tours offered in
August. Admission: $10 for tours of the house and gardens; $5 for
ages 10 to 18; under 10, free; $3 for the gardens only.
</P>
<P>
   Rienzi, with its fine collection of 18th- and 19th-century
European decorative arts, is less than a mile from Bayou Bend, at
1406 Kirby Drive. Open Monday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday from
10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; Sundays 1 to 5 p.m.; guided tours only (by
reservation). Admission $6; children allowed Sunday only.
Reservations: (713) 639-7800.

   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ Like most Iraqis, Hamed Khalaf has nothing but
bad choices.
</P>
<P>
   As his country's economy collapses, the 32-year-old unemployed
taxi driver struggles to support his mother and two war-disabled
brothers. First, they sold the house, then the taxi, then the
furniture and the carpets.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he was in Baghdad's outdoor book market. The dour
Khalaf sold off his brothers' collection of Arabic culture picture
journals for about 40 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the last of what I have,'' he says. ``Next, I'll
sell my clothes. I mean it.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, diplomats at the United Nations Security Council are
trying to make their own difficult choices about the sanctions on
Khalaf's Iraq. Proposals range from maintaining the severe status
quo to lifting the sanctions entirely.
</P>
<P>
   When they were imposed after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in
1990, few thought the sanctions would be needed more than a year.
More than eight years later, life for the 22 million Iraqis in the
land of Babylon has taken on truly Old Testament elements, from
pestilence to hunger.
</P>
<P>
   Children die daily for lack of common medicines and from the
``epidemic'' spread, according to the UN, of treatable maladies
like diarrhea and malaria. Much of the drinking water is unclean.
Tuberculosis is about five times more prevalent than before 1990
and 70 percent of Iraqi women are anemic.
</P>
<P>
   In increasing numbers, children drop out of school to become
beggars or street sellers. In school, they sit on classroom floors
and recycle last year's workbooks.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, U.N. reports issued dire warnings about conditions
in Iraq. In fittingly cruel irony, the warnings came as the world
is distracted trying to contain Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic -- another alleged dictator seemingly unharmed by the
sanctions on his country. Iraqi suffering will grind on a while
longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is on hold at this point,'' says former
undersecretary of state Richard Murphy, who himself is unsure about
what can be done. ``It is a deep stalemate.''
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions are unprecedented. Notes Richard Garfield, a
sanctions expert and epidemiologist at Columbia University, such
sanctions were nearly impossible during the Cold War. A country
like Cuba could be shut out by one side but get help from the
other. Iraq is isolated by all.
</P>
<P>
   ``No country has experienced such comprehensive sanctions in
this century,'' Garfield says. ``It is a new weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   In a study released in March, Garfield concluded that mortality
rates for children under five years of age are double what they
were before the sanctions. It means that an extra 110,000 to
225,000 Iraqi children have died since the sanctions began.
</P>
<P>
   While Iraq is not as poor as many African or Latin American
nations, it has fallen far. Just 10 years ago, the oil-rich land
had a medical system that was the most respected in the Arab world
and living conditions that compared well with the region.
</P>
<P>
   As years go by, the sanctions get harder to justify, especially
in light of their limited results.
</P>
<P>
   The plan after the war was for weapons inspectors to destroy
Hussein's chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programs of mass
destruction. Hussein was to comply with other obligations, such as
paying reparations to Kuwait, and the sanctions would be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   But the program has lurched from crisis to crisis. Hussein has
not cooperated with the weapons inspectors and, amid repeated U.S.
air strikes, now refuses to let them back in the country.
</P>
<P>
   True, the sanctions have kept Saddam from rebuilding what was
once the fourth largest army in the world. He is not a threat to
his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   However, even sanctions supporters concede that the sanctions
have strengthened Saddam's hold on Iraq by consolidating the
country's little wealth in his regime. A stalemate, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, with concern building about the privation facing
Iraqis, the U.N. approved the so-called oil-for-food program. It
began in late 1996, and now allows Iraq to sell up to $10.4 billion
in oil annually. One-third goes to repaying Kuwait, the rest is for
food, medicine, clean water and electricity. The money is held and
tracked by the U.N.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. says that health and nutrition have stopped
deteriorating, but they are not getting better. About a quarter of
Iraqi children are still malnourished.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials point to the oil-for-food program to show they
mean no harm to ordinary Iraqis. But, Iraq's hobbling oil industry
cannot produce anywhere near the $10.4 billion cap and the U.N. has
concluded that even that would not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hussein's own cruel negligence hurts his case for
lifting the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Through oil smuggling, some of which is tolerated by the United
States because the precious commodity goes to allies like Jordan
and Turkey, Hussein can raise an estimated $500 million a year that
is not monitored by the U.N.
</P>
<P>
   He spends it on palaces -- building about a dozen since the
sanctions started. Last month, he opened a new vacation village,
with an amusement park, stadiums and a bronze statue of himself. He
is beginning to build what he says will be the largest mosque in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein's police have brand new Hyundai patrol cars and the
streets signs show new lit portraits of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Worse still, though the U.N. monitors the oil money, Iraq
dispenses the goods. It has not done so well.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. recently reported that Iraq has distributed only 48
percent of the $570 million in medical supplies bought over the
last two years. Warehouses, the U.N. noted, are ``literally
overflowing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason is that they don't want their people to stop
dying,'' says Amatzia Baram, an Israeli expert on Iraq at
Georgetown University. He says Saddam contributes to his people's
misery to build world sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   But just because a dictator does not care about his people does
not mean the world should turn its back.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. concluded in April that, even with the government's
failings, ``the Iraqi people would not be undergoing such
depravations in the absence of the prolonged measures imposed by
the security council and the effects of war . . . the country has
experienced a shift from relative affluence to massive poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   True, lifting the sanctions would give Saddam access to the kind
of money he needs to rebuild his army, which Baram says would take
$10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But, given that Saddam was spending 80 percent of his money on
arms before the Kuwait invasion, Baram believes that lifting the
sanctions may not improve the lives of regular Iraqis very much.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the sanctions counter that Iraq took care of its
humanitarian needs before the sanctions. They say that if U.S.
officials want to stop Saddam from re-arming, they could lead an
arms embargo or continue the frequent air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   There is a middle option. British diplomats are pushing a
proposal that would require Saddam to cooperate for several months
with weapons inspections, then remove the cap on oil sales. The
money would still be controlled by the U.N., but foreign companies
would be encouraged to rebuild the Iraqi oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the plan is logical, but has two important drawbacks
-- neither the Americans nor the Iraqis have accepted it.
</P>
<P>
   American officials have supported the concept of removing the
cap, but reportedly worry that the British plan moves to quickly.
The Iraqis, meanwhile, have a hard time accepting a program that
does not let them handle their own money.
</P>
<P>
   But, the main obstacle now may be the world's distraction over
Milosevic and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, the former state department official, says U.S.
officials seem in no hurry to resolve Iraq, satisfied that Saddam
is crippled.
</P>
<P>
   He says that is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a moral dimension,'' he says. ``A society has been
eviscerated.''

   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ With their sneakers, cartoon-clad backpacks and
pony tails, these girls would fit in at any American school.
</P>
<P>
   But, when visitors enter classes at the Hidayeh (Enlightenment)
Elementary School in Baghdad, the students rise together with
smiles and shout, ``Welcome and long live the leader, Saddam
Hussein!''
</P>
<P>
   There's something else different about schools in Iraq. This
one, with about 1,200 girls, has one telephone and no copying
machine. Lights are often out in the school, and many students sit
on the floors for lack of even a broken-down desk.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, the girls start their studies by erasing the
penciled-in work in last year's workbooks so they can be re-used.
</P>
<P>
   Serious Samar Khatab, a 13-year-old fifth-grader, sums up the
problem saying, ``It is because of the sanctions. The enemy
countries want to take everything from us because we were rich.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight years after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and the world
slapped economic sanctions on Iraq, aid officials are worried about
the degradation of a generation of students like Samar.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions supporters will note that there is money squandered in
Iraq. Despite the sanctions, Saddam has opened palaces worth tens
of millions of dollars. Near this school, a couple of bulldozers
scrape at the site of the Saddam Hussein Mosque, planned to be the
biggest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But aid groups say even the money for those projects would not
reverse the overall degradation of this country of 22 million
people. Especially for its children.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was one of the most progressive countries in the Middle
East. Today it is in a state of disrepair and dilapidation that is
having a formative effect on the youth,'' Hans von(CQ) Sponeck, the
United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator in Iraq, said in a recent
interview with Cox Newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   It is leading, he said, ``to a generation deprived of
knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   In America, children are getting hooked into global learning
through computers and the Internet. When a visitor asked children
at Hidayeh Elementary who among them knew what a computer was, only
a few hands were raised.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, these children are lucky to be in school. Enrollment
from first grade through college has dropped from 56 percent in
1990 to 42 percent today. Many children live and beg in the
streets. Other children work.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers are in short supply because salaries have dropped to
around $4 a month.
</P>
<P>
   At Hidayeh, a school in a lower-middle class area of central
Baghdad, many classes have more than 55 children. They often show
the lethargy expected in a country where almost a quarter of the
children are undernourished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, it will affect their future,'' says deputy school
director Talia Ali Hussein. ``If they are suffering now, how can
they build a society in the future?''

and Turkey, Hussein can raise an estimated $500 million a year that
is not monitored by the U.N.
</P>
<P>
   He spends it on palaces -- building about a dozen since the
sanctions started. Last month, he opened a new vacation village,
with an amusement park, stadiums and a bronze statue of himself. He
is beginning to build what he says will be the largest mosque in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein's police have brand new Hyundai patrol cars and the
streets signs show new lit portraits of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Worse still, though the U.N. monitors the oil money, Iraq
dispenses the goods. It has not done so well.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. recently reported that Iraq has distributed only 48
percent of the $570 million in medical supplies bought over the
last two years. Warehouses, the U.N. noted, are ``literally
overflowing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason is that they don't want their people to stop
dying,'' says Amatzia Baram, an Israeli expert on Iraq at
Georgetown University. He says Saddam contributes to his people's
misery to build world sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   But just because a dictator does not care about his people does
not mean the world should turn its back.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. concluded in April that, even with the government's
failings, ``the Iraqi people would not be undergoing such
depravations in the absence of the prolonged measures imposed by
the security council and the effects of war . . . the country has
experienced a shift from relative affluence to massive poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   True, lifting the sanctions would give Saddam access to the kind
of money he needs to rebuild his army, which Baram says would take
$10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But, given that Saddam was spending 80 percent of his money on
arms before the Kuwait invasion, Baram believes that lifting the
sanctions may not improve the lives of regular Iraqis very much.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the sanctions counter that Iraq took care of its
humanitarian needs before the sanctions. They say that if U.S.
officials want to stop Saddam from re-arming, they could lead an
arms embargo or continue the frequent air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   There is a middle option. British diplomats are pushing a
proposal that would require Saddam to cooperate for several months
with weapons inspections, then remove the cap on oil sales. The
money would still be controlled by the U.N., but foreign companies
would be encouraged to rebuild the Iraqi oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the plan is logical, but has two important drawbacks
-- neither the Americans nor the Iraqis have accepted it.
</P>
<P>
   American officials have supported the concept of removing the
cap, but reportedly worry that the British plan moves to quickly.
The Iraqis, meanwhile, have a hard time accepting a program that
does not let them handle their own money.
</P>
<P>
   But, the main obstacle now may be the world's distraction over
Milosevic and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, the former state department official, says U.S.
officials seem in no hurry to resolve Iraq, satisfied that Saddam
is crippled.
</P>
<P>
   He says that is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a moral dimension,'' he says. ``A society has been
eviscerated.''

   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ With their sneakers, cartoon-clad backpacks and
pony tails, these girls would fit in at any American school.
</P>
<P>
   But, when visitors enter classes at the Hidayeh (Enlightenment)
Elementary School in Baghdad, the students rise together with
smiles and shout, ``Welcome and long live the leader, Saddam
Hussein!''
</P>
<P>
   There's something else different about schools in Iraq. This
one, with about 1,200 girls, has one telephone and no copying
machine. Lights are often out in the school, and many students sit
on the floors for lack of even a broken-down desk.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, the girls start their studies by erasing the
penciled-in work in last year's workbooks so they can be re-used.
</P>
<P>
   Serious Samar Khatab, a 13-year-old fifth-grader, sums up the
problem saying, ``It is because of the sanctions. The enemy
countries want to take everything from us because we were rich.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight years after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and the world
slapped economic sanctions on Iraq, aid officials are worried about
the degradation of a generation of students like Samar.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions supporters will note that there is money squandered in
Iraq. Despite the sanctions, Saddam has opened palaces worth tens
of millions of dollars. Near this school, a couple of bulldozers
scrape at the site of the Saddam Hussein Mosque, planned to be the
biggest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But aid groups say even the money for those projects would not
reverse the overall degradation of this country of 22 million
people. Especially for its children.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was one of the most progressive countries in the Middle
East. Today it is in a state of disrepair and dilapidation that is
having a formative effect on the youth,'' Hans von(CQ) Sponeck, the
United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator in Iraq, said in a recent
interview with Cox Newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   It is leading, he said, ``to a generation deprived of
knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   In America, children are getting hooked into global learning
through computers and the Internet. When a visitor asked children
at Hidayeh Elementary who among them knew what a computer was, only
a few hands were raised.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, these children are lucky to be in school. Enrollment
from first grade through college has dropped from 56 percent in
1990 to 42 percent today. Many children live and beg in the
streets. Other children work.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers are in short supply because salaries have dropped to
around $4 a month.
</P>
<P>
   At Hidayeh, a school in a lower-middle class area of central
Baghdad, many classes have more than 55 children. They often show
the lethargy expected in a country where almost a quarter of the
children are undernourished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, it will affect their future,'' says deputy school
director Talia Ali Hussein. ``If they are suffering now, how can
they build a society in the future?''

   AN EQUAL MUSIC

 &UR; QUARTET FOR FIVE
</P>
<P>
   BY NICHOLAS CHRISTOPHER
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty of writing fiction about music and musicians has
so often been remarked that it has become a kind of self-fulfilling
observation.
</P>
<P>
   Having to ``describe music'' is said to present countless
difficulties. In an author's note to his new novel, ``An Equal
Music,'' Vikram Seth writes: ``Music to me is dearer even than
speech. When I realized that I would be writing about it I was
gripped with anxiety.'' Because it was dear to him -- or were there
other sources for his anxiety?
</P>
<P>
   In remarks intended for Goethe, Beethoven famously observed:
``Music, verily, is the mediator between intellectual and sensuous
life. . . . Tell him to hear my symphonies and he will say that I
am right in saying that music is the one incorporeal entrance into
the higher world of knowledge which comprehends mankind but which
mankind cannot comprehend.'' Seth seems to understand that writing
about an artist usually means exploring the circumstances of his
art. So he concentrates on the dynamics of the string quartet on
which he centers his book and captures well the backstage theatrics
of a musical performer's life, the intricacies of concert
preparation, the tedium of life on the concert circuit (hotel
rooms, meals, dead time) and the complicated interactions of
musicians and their booking agents and record companies.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to people -- to the specific personal and
professional interrelationships within the quartet -- the novel
falters. In tone and content, the musicians' many conversations
veer between the mundane and the hyperbolic. And predictability and
cliched feelings undermine the romance at the heart of the book.
</P>
<P>
   The plot elements are themselves problematic: a restless,
querulous violinist re-encounters his long-lost love, who is now a
wife and mother. She is a concert pianist -- with the added twist
that she is going deaf. A musician losing her hearing over the
course of a novel, like a painter going blind or a ballerina
succumbing to gradual paralysis, perilously skirts the bathetic.
Which is a pity here, for Seth's violinist, Michael Holme, and his
pianist, Julia McNicholl, are in many ways appealing and
interesting characters.
</P>
<P>
   Michael is a member of the Maggiore Quartet. His partners are
Billy, Helen and Piers. When they play music, Seth is inclined to
give us canned catalogues of their responses and actions: ``Today
we are running through a couple of Haydn quartets and a Brahms. . .
. We love Haydn, and he makes us love each other. Not so Brahms. He
has always been a cross for our quartet. I feel no affinity for
Brahms, Piers can't stand him, Helen adores him, Billy finds him
'deeply interesting,' whatever that means.'' Here is the quartet
again, during a long curtain call one night: ``Helen and I are
grinning from ear to ear, Piers is trying to look statesmanlike and
Billy gets in a couple of sneezes.'' And again: ``All three of us
turn on Billy. 'No way,' say I. 'Ridiculous!' says Piers. 'What?'
says Helen.'' After many such encapsulations -- some unintendedly
comic -- one begins to anticipate them with dread, for they do not
enhance, but rather subvert, the textual power of the music that we
ought to see animating these performers.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Seth deftly delineates Michael's teaching session
with a pupil, Virginie. He allows them to speak clearly about the
score they are working through, and gives us a concise glimpse of
Michael thinking intelligently about both the music and the
frustrations of teaching. One looks in vain for that same concision
when we are presented with Julia and Michael's relationship, the
evolution of their musical careers and the travails of the Maggiore
Quartet.
</P>
<P>
   In his author's note Seth also thanks ``a number of friends''
who ``generously agreed to read the first draft of the manuscript
-- a task I can hardly bear to do, even for my own work.'' This is
a strange admission for any writer, and an unfortunate one in the
case of this book. A more careful reading of his manuscript might
have enabled Seth to eliminate much of the overbaked interior
monologues, gratuitous description and endless patter that
substitutes for dialogue. In reporting the back-and-forth
discussions of the quartet in rehearsal, he offers up not
revelations but seemingly interminable banter:
</P>
<P>
   '' 'Why don't we plan a structure around the tunes?' Billy
suggests.
</P>
<P>
   '' 'Well, it sort of lacks tunes,' I say. 'Not melody exactly,
but melodicity. Do I mean that? What's the right word?'
</P>
<P>
   '' 'Melodiousness,' says Helen. 'And, incidentally, it doesn't
lack tunes.'
</P>
<P>
   '' 'But what do you mean by that?' says Piers to me. 'It's all
tune. I mean, I'm not saying I like it, but. . . .'
</P>
<P>
   ``I point my bow at Piers's music. 'Is that tune? I doubt even
Brahms would claim that was tune.'
</P>
<P>
   '' 'Well, it's not arpeggio, it's not scale, it's not ornament,
so . . . oh, I don't know. It's all mad and clogged up. Bloody
Edinburgh. . . .'
</P>
<P>
   '' 'Stop ranting, Piers,' ``says Helen.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, ``mad and clogged up'' is how much of the
dialogue feels in ``An Equal Music.'' We find other examples in a
telephone call Virginie makes to Michael to cancel a lesson; in the
extended, unpleasant debate between Michael and a flight attendant
about the color of a sandwich wrapping; and in the page-long
discussion of the time of day between Michael and Julia as they
wake one morning. The book is also filled with passages like:
``Last year I heard a snatch of Bach, in a taxi of all places. I
rarely take cabs, cabs rarely play music, any music they do play is
rarely classical.'' After a while, they numb the reader and sap the
efficacy of both the love affair and the musical relationships that
the story chronicles.
</P>
<P>
   Vikram Seth is a talented writer who has published books of
poetry and translation in addition to an inventive light-verse
novel, ``The Golden Gate,'' and the sprawling, multitiered novel
``A Suitable Boy.'' He was rightly praised for the fine detail,
clear voice and witty style that marked ``The Golden Gate,'' and
one only wishes he had infused ``An Equal Music'' with more of
those same qualities.

   Ian Rutledge, the shellshocked Scotland Yard detective in
Charles Todd's haunting post-World War I mysteries, takes his
troubled conscience to a Dorset village in SEARCH THE DARK (Thomas
Dunne/St. Martin's, $24.95) to investigate the death of an unknown
woman and the disappearance of her two children. Although the
victim was beaten beyond recognition, public opinion has it that a
deranged veteran (a ``shabby stranger with frantic eyes'') killed
the entire family in a fit of insane grief, because they reminded
him of the loved ones he lost in the war. Only Rutledge, himself
heavily burdened with survivor guilt, has the compassion to
recognize the man's innocence and the insight to search for the
true murderer among the locals, a striking collection of insular
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Dorset countryside in 1919 is pictured as a place
of quiet healing, the secretive people who live there are buffeted
by ``passion, hot and raw,'' and the very air is poisoned by their
deceit, suspicion, malicious envy and calculated cruelty. Todd
works these volatile elements into a remarkable village mystery,
classically constructed around a central puzzle but driven by
characters of great psychological complexity. ``We all walk with
shadows,'' one tormented soul confides to Rutledge, who is
honorable enough to let his own ghosts choose the path of his
conscience.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to go wrong with a story that opens with a bunch of
nuns huddled around an empty grave in the dead of a Montreal
winter. Kathy Reichs follows up that first, eye-catching scene of
DEATH DU JOUR (Scribner, $25) with more Gothic jolts, from a fire
that yields two mutilated babies among the dead to the chewed-up
corpses of college students attacked by dogs. In one cop's laconic
understatement: ``Just when you think you've seen it all, you learn
that you haven't.''
</P>
<P>
   This sequel to ``Dej Dead'' is not as grisly as it sounds,
largely because the analysis of these atrocities is entrusted to
Temperance Brennan, like the author a certified forensic
anthropologist who teaches in North Carolina and moonlights for the
Province of Quebec in a police lab in Montreal. Sanitized by the
scientific paraphernalia in the morgue (and reanimated by Tempe's
lively table talk during autopsies), the body parts lose their
grotesque horror to become puzzle pieces in the arcane but
fascinating practice of reading bones. All the same, Reichs does
manage to go wrong: by hitching these realistic procedures to the
bizarre doings of a sinister religious cult, by stuffing the story
with so many characters that even the living ones seem half-dead,
by kicking the bloated plot back and forth between Montreal and
North Carolina and by weighting the carcass with too many
coincidences to get it to float.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Wallander, the melancholy detective in Henning Mankell's
Swedish policiers, takes it personally when a crime is committed on
his turf. In SIDETRACKED (New Press, $25), the work of a serial
killer who dispatches his victims with an ax (and carries off their
scalps as trophies) throws him into a deep depression. ``For a
brief moment he felt an indescribable sorrow inside'' is how
Mankell describes Wallander's state of mind when he realizes that
an entirely foreign kind of violence has surfaced in Ystad, his own
fair city on the Baltic Sea. ``The world had both shrunk and
expanded at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Mankell observes local police routines in close detail, while
taking a parallel path to follow the insane logic and precise
methods of the killer. But it is Wallander's anguished voice,
delivered from the bottom of an emotional well in Steven T.
Murray's pensive translation, that captures us. While all of Sweden
is following World Cup soccer and preparing for its collective
summer vacation, this sober cop can't get over the girl who torched
herself in a farmer's field. (``She kept running and running. And
burning and burning.'') Brooding on the alienation of the young,
the fragmentation of families and the ``great loneliness'' that
attends this breakdown of modern society, Mankell's philosophical
hero vows to make it up to the coming generation while he still
can.
</P>
<P>
   Two pages into Stan Jones's WHITE SKY, BLACK ICE (Soho, $22),
you can feel the bite of the west wind that comes screaming across
the Alaska tundra and sense the isolation of the Inupiat Eskimos
who live in this desolate part of the far north. Nathan Active, the
state trooper who brings much of the warmth to this stark debut
novel, has kept his distance from Chukchi, the miserable little
town where he was born and from which he thought he'd escaped when
he was adopted by a white family in Anchorage. But a job
reassignment drags Nathan (a nalauqmiiyaaq, or half-breed, to his
old neighbors) back to face a rash of suicides and hints of trouble
at the copper mine that has brought hope to the hard-luck
community. The crimes that come to light are nasty, but nowhere
near as interesting as the cycles of life in this fierce climate,
or as appealing as the Inupiat characters who speak in a
``stripped-down village English'' that after a while starts to make
real sense to Nathan.
</P>
<P>
   With its fine churches and stately homes, its new industries and
bustling downtown, South Bend, Ind., in 1900 looks like paradise to
Hilda Johansson, a young Swedish maid who keeps house for the
prominent Studebaker family and makes a spirited amateur sleuth in
DEATH IN LACQUER RED (Walker, $22.95), by Jeanne M. Dams. In her
first adventure, Hilda finds the battered body of a missionary
lady, the sister of the grand political personage who lives next
door, and takes it upon herself to solve the crime before people
look for a scapegoat among the city's immigrant population. The
detection work is catch as catch can, because as Hilda sensibly
points out: ``Me, I can talk to other servants, I can learn things.
. . . What I cannot do is go far, or talk to people I do not
know.'' But Hilda loves life, and the joy she takes in the simple
pleasures of Sunday picnics and summer holidays and a loud, lusty
hymn is treat enough for now.

 &UR; THE UNMAKING OF A SECRETARY
</P>
<P>
   BY BARBARA CROSSETTE
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Boutros Boutros-Ghali, hounded out of office by the Clinton
Administration in 1996, the only United Nations Secretary General
ever to be denied a second term, sets out in this book to tell his
side of that miserable tale.
</P>
<P>
   At one level, the account is an act of self-justification.
Boutros-Ghali, an erudite Egyptian who served the United States
well during the boldest years of peacemaking between Israel and
Egypt, can now, two decades later, portray himself as a wronged
international civil servant who got in the way of American
politics. Perfidious Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Unvanquished,'' Boutros-Ghali does not limit himself to
that part of the story, however. Rather, he surveys in detail and
from an international perspective how the Clinton White House
operated during years of crises in Somalia, Rwanda, Bosnia and
beyond. Appearing as it does now, in the shadow of a Balkan war and
as historians begin to assess the Clinton record in foreign
affairs, the book is likely to be mined for its revealing if
anecdotal portrayal of a politically thin-skinned and often
indecisive President.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, Boutros-Ghali says, he was warned against
rattling the president by Secretary of State Warren Christopher and
Madeleine K. Albright, who was Washington's chief representative at
the United Nations before moving to the State Department as
Christopher's successor.
</P>
<P>
   They bluntly told the Secretary General where not to travel,
what envoys to appoint, whom to avoid meeting and what to say or
not say in speeches. He was advised to keep his distance from
Congress, where the Republican leadership had painted him as a
threat to American sovereignty and made sport of his name.
Americans would not take orders from ``Boootrous Boootrous-Ghali,''
Bob Dole said.
</P>
<P>
   On a visit to Washington during the Somalia crisis, the
Secretary General was asked not to meet the editorial board of The
Washington Post and not to mention the $1 billion-plus American
debt to the United Nations in a speech to the United Nations
Association, a private citizens support and research organization.
</P>
<P>
   Boutros-Ghali, a strong-willed man very conscious of his
self-image (``not the easiest person to deal with,'' as he himself
says), ignored most of these demands, adding to the friction that
ultimately cost him his job. Even his associates admit that he
veered between contempt for his adversaries and a highly developed
sense of victimization when things went wrong. In any event, he
continued to seek meetings with the President or other high
administration officials to clarify what seemed to him by 1994 to
be an ``utterly confused'' foreign policy, or to put forward his
own ideas. He was usually rebuffed, or at best treated with
disdain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming from a developing country, I was trained extensively in
international law and diplomacy and mistakenly assumed that the
great powers, especially the United States, also trained their
representatives in diplomacy and accepted the value of it,''
Boutros-Ghali writes bitterly after describing a particularly
unpleasant exchange with Christopher and Albright. ``But the Roman
Empire had no need for diplomacy. Neither does the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   No administration officials, except some in the Pentagon, come
off looking good. Boutros-Ghali says that his relations with
Albright began well. ``I was puzzled, however, by what seemed her
desire to strike attitudes rather than address substantive
issues,'' he writes. Her warmth, he soon discovered, ``turned to
fury the instant problems surfaced.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren Christopher proved to be hard to get to know and appeared
at times to be in the dark about conflicts within the
administration. In Haiti, for example, Boutros-Ghali's
representatives discerned deep differences between the Central
Intelligence Agency and the State Department over the reliability
of the deposed president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Christopher
seemed surprised and annoyed to hear this.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1993 Somalia crisis, created in no small measure by
the United States -- although Boutros-Ghali does accept some of the
blame for allowing Italy, the former colonial power, to send troops
with their own agendas to the conflict -- the Secretary General
thought that both Christopher and Albright ``seemed unsure of their
roles.'' The subsequent deaths of 18 American Army Rangers in
Mogadishu, although under United States and not United Nations
command, poisoned the atmosphere for future American participation
in peacekeeping, most tragically in Rwanda the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Boutros-Ghali's anger over the Clinton Administration's pattern
of voting for tough Security Council resolutions and then refusing
to support the action called for, epitomized most clearly in
Bosnia, is often disguised in a deadpan writing style that allows
the reader to draw the intended conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The former Secretary General now spends most of his time in
Paris, where he was educated at the Sorbonne, writing and running
an international organization of francophone countries. An intense,
scholarly diplomat prone to answering casual questions with
lectures on history, art or geopolitics, Boutros-Ghali never tried
to mix into American social life. His aloofness and intellectual
arrogance, as well as his championing of the third world, were
widely held against him among politicians and policy analysts
alike.
</P>
<P>
   In the light of this, it is interesting to note that his
successor, Kofi Annan of Ghana, the Clinton Administration's
choice, has not fared too well with Washington either. Annan, a
graduate of Macalester College in St. Paul, is very much at home in
America. But he has also been short-changed by the White House and
stonewalled by a Congress demanding virtual control over the United
Nations, adding credence to Boutros-Ghali's sense that the problem
is not Republican or Democrat, but American.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one great gap in this book, it is Boutros-Ghali's
failure to analyze rigorously why so many other nations, among them
his soul mates, the French, are letting this happen. He ventures
only to suggest that American power overwhelms all in its path.
``Single-superpower hegemony is a transitory phenomenon, but
globalization is an irreversible force on a scale heretofore
unseen,'' Boutros-Ghali concludes. Globalization introduces
unfamiliar problems, and ``the only truly global mechanism for
addressing them is the United Nations.''

 THE BOY ON THE GREEN BICYCLE

<P>
   A Memoir.

 &UR; THE USES OF ENCHANTMENT
</P>
<P>
   BY STACEY D'ERASMO
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of Margaret Diehl's memoir, ``The Boy on the
Green Bicycle,'' she describes a typical moment from her, or
anyone's, adolescence: ``I opened the bakery box, let the smell
drift out, picked up whatever novel I was reading. My eyes hooked
to the first sentence. My hand brought the eclair to my lips, I bit
through chocolate and pastry.'' The skill and terror of this memoir
are such, however, that the reader now understands that this is a
violent scene, as potentially lethal to the young Diehl as a
speeding car.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly, Diehl's book concerns another, very literal,
speeding car: the one that killed her 14-year-old brother, Jimmy,
who was riding his new green bicycle home from a friend's house one
February evening in 1965. She traces the impact of that tragedy on
the family -- her mother, her father, her older sister, herself and
her younger brother -- with impressionistic density, describing in
thick detail their life before the accident.
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath of Jimmy's death is all the more painful when
juxtaposed with the years before; we can see the size of the loss.
But as with many family tragedies and crises, Jimmy's death sets in
motion a chain of events that reveal much darker truths about the
Diehls. Like an earthquake shaking a building to the ground, the
death of the oldest Diehl child rocks the structure of the entire
family, and the personality of each family member. It becomes clear
that the title refers to the last image they all saw -- a lyrical,
ordinary thing, a boy on a bicycle -- before the world fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   It had been a privileged world. ``We had seven bedrooms and
seven baths,'' Diehl writes of her family home in Montclair, N.J.,
``halls long enough to play soccer in, a wine cellar, the dungeons
and an attic.'' Her father worked in publishing; her mother was a
charming, bookish housewife; both, says Diehl, were beautiful and
``sexually charismatic.'' Though her father drank too much and
sometimes raged, her mother made up for it by sewing and cooking
and gardening everything in sight to a fare-thee-well. ``Under the
tree on Christmas morning, unwrapped, were our presents, arranged
in intricate tableaux,'' Diehl remembers. Among the children, Jimmy
was the shining leader who taught his siblings what sarcasm was,
Charlotte was hard and cool, Johnny was volatile and Margaret was
the shy, plump one who was always reading. She was, in other words,
the loser, frequently referred to by her sister as Blubber Baby and
Booger.
</P>
<P>
   Booger's revenge is the construction of a glimmering,
fortresslike interior life, built of fairy stories and C. S.
Lewis's Narnia chronicles and her own nearly autoerotic powers of
observation. Instead of hitting back, she thinks constantly about
magic, invisible doors to the underworld, the souls of mermaids. At
one point, Diehl describes her young self as defusing a frightening
moment by ``Margareting the room,'' engulfing ``the scary places .
. . with coils of thought, sticky and luminous strands.'' This
aggressive, sexual, alienlike figure of her own imagination echoes
throughout the book, which is gorgeously suffused not only with
metaphor but with metaphors for the making of metaphor, the action
of thought and the self-hypnosis of cerebration. It comes as no
real surprise when Diehl indicates that she later became an
alcoholic, because she describes herself as a child as existing in
a glamorous state of near-constant intoxication.
</P>
<P>
   She regularly got drunk on reading, on sugar, on perception, on
dreams, on grief, even on the house itself. She recalls her
personal mythology of the stairway: ``The top stair, the second,
the third. Territories, alliances. Royal beings who lived inside
the wood. When we were present they had to hide, but sent messages
up through our skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Death has a hard time gaining a foothold in such a universe. If
everything can be converted through magic or language into some
other, winged creation, nothing can ever really be lost. In one
respect, this is a theology, but in another, as Diehl recognizes,
it's madness. ``Madness is turning the information other people
give out into dreams, occult sightings, messages from oneself,''
she writes.
</P>
<P>
   After Jimmy dies, Diehl's particular madness -- the madness of
losing oneself in fancy -- winds around her with increasing force,
sealing her off from the harsh events around her and from her own
grief. One can hardly blame her: shortly after her brother died,
her father committed suicide, her younger brother began staying out
until 2 A.M. with the rough kids and the intoxicating, many-roomed
house was sold. By the age of 10, she has experienced a lifetime's
worth of loss. The book ends not long after what's left of the
family moves to New York City, where they slowly tumble into the
unhappy versions of themselves one imagines they remained fixed in
for many years thereafter. Diehl's two novels, ``Men'' and ``Me &AMP;
You,'' concern young women who quest for themselves through
drinking and sex, with mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   Diehl's descriptions of both the terrible events in her family
and the golden stuff of her own interiority are so entrancing that
one realizes too late -- just as she does -- that fairyland can be
a gravityless hell. What could be more innocent, more wholesome,
than a girl reading a book? But Diehl is bold enough, and maybe sad
enough, to turn this classic image inside out. The meaning of a
girl reading a book depends on the girl and the book and, though it
may not be visible in the scene, what's happening in the world all
around her. Under certain circumstances, swooning on words is
itself a kind of death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Boy on the Green Bicycle'' scared me, and I mean that as a
compliment. Instead of simply valorizing or sentimentalizing the
imagination, Diehl gives it its due as a ferocious, drug-like
force. The lion who looks like a friend to the fanciful child is
also, as the adult knows, a wild animal. Diehl fearlessly inhabits
both points of view. The subject of her book is less her brother
and her cracked family than it is the ambiguous power of her own
fantasy life. Friend or foe? she seems to be asking. Lover or
murderer?
</P>
<P>
   The day her brother died, she went to her room and read a
mystery magazine, then realized that though people were dying in
the stories, none of the tales were really about death. She felt
comforted, guilty, anxious, unpleasantly aware of herself, reading
instead of grieving: ``What I was thinking, the very fact that I
was thinking: this newborn (death-generated) intelligence itself a
perversity.'' Consider this book her history of that perversity.

 ADOPTING ALYOSHA
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Single Man Finds a Son in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   By Robert Klose.
</P>
<P>
   University Press of Mississippi. $22.

 &UR; FROM RUSSIA, WITH LOVE
</P>
<P>
   BY DAVE EGGERS
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   For a variety of reasons, some of them valid, we're suspicious
of single men with young boys. Being a single male parent means
occupying the lowest spot on the totem pole of parental
preferability. If a child must have only one parent (and that
parent is not the star of a breakthrough television dramedy), the
mother is preferred over the father. If that single parent is
neither mother nor father, a female relative is preferred over a
male one. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   This partly explains why adoptions by single men are rare, and
why Robert Klose's account of the long, grueling road he took to
adopt a child is so often enthralling. Klose, an associate
professor of biological science at University College of Bangor, in
Maine, is intelligent, well spoken in matters of child care and
financially secure. In the early stages of his adoption process, he
clears all hurdles with ease. But even after his local agency
approves him for adoption, his climb up what he calls ``the greased
flagpole'' has just begun.
</P>
<P>
   As with many hopeful adoptive parents, his chances of adopting a
foreign boy are much greater than those of adopting an
American-born child. But even then, most countries have their own
idiosyncratic restrictions. Thailand disallows any adoptions by
single parents. The Polish agencies prefer Roman Catholics. The
Peruvians reportedly ``will let anyone adopt,'' but at the time of
Klose's search their programs were closed as the result of
political turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with multiple agencies and intermediaries, Klose
ricochets between promises made and hopes repeatedly dashed. One
day he's on the verge of adopting a 7-year-old in Guatemala.
Another day, a 3-year-old in Honduras. The conversations, like this
one with a woman handling Bolivian adoptions, sound eerily like
negotiations for the purchase of, say, stereo equipment:
</P>
<P>
   ``They have three boys, all in the age group you're approved
for: Johnny and Jose, both 6, and Daniel, who's 5.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And they'll definitely allow a single man to adopt?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely. These boys are ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't pan out. Much of the time, the process is ridiculous,
given the gravity of the task at hand. One organization is run out
of the home of a woman in California who works with someone named
Jorge, an orphan-finding partner in Guatemala. Klose, trusting and
desperate, invests $3,000 with the organization, which is sent to
Jorge, who promptly disappears with it.
</P>
<P>
   That $3,000 is a fraction of what many agencies want --
adoptions from Hungary, Klose writes, cost as much as $20,000 --
and he ends up spending more than $12,000. Indeed, the issue of
money begets some of the book's most unintentionally disturbing
passages. ``The only way to satisfy them,'' Klose writes of one
agency, ``seemed to be to throw myself at their mercy and take
whatever child they could come up with. But I had no interest in
satisfying them. I wanted to satisfy myself. . . . I am the
consumer. . . . I am the consumer. . . . I am the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   As we follow his progress, for a time ``Adopting Alyosha'' reads
like a thriller. We forget the outcome made clear in the book's
title and get caught up in wondering which boy will come to live in
the bedroom Klose has already decorated. But once the adoption of
Alyosha is imminent, the book loses steam and focus -- the suspense
over, the second half seems like filler. Eleven pages are devoted
to Klose's plane ride to Russia, including dubious commentary on
the airport bathrooms in Shannon, Ireland. As much as we liked
Klose in the first half -- his passion and tenacity endear him to
us -- we lose patience with him in the second. The minute-by-minute
accounting of his time in Russia is excessive, and his observations
(``Chekhov is far and away my favorite Russian author'') are
increasingly banal.
</P>
<P>
   Described by the publisher as the first book to be written about
a single man adopting from abroad, ``Adopting Alyosha'' might be
considered requisite reading for anyone planning to do what Klose
did. (If it was this difficult for a well-educated, financially
solvent heterosexual man, God knows what the average hopeful has in
store.) It might even be worthwhile for single women, or even
couples, hoping to adopt foreign children. As casual reading for
anyone else, it rarely transcends its guidebook flavor, though in
offering further proof of the innumerable ways one can (and often
must) make a family, ``Adopting Alyosha'' is instructive. And we
can always use such instruction.

 &UR; ISLANDERS
</P>
<P>
   BY SARAH FERGUSON
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Lightning strikes, a cat talks and Grandma's ghost sabotages a
family dinner in ``Local Girls,'' Alice Hoffman's collection of
stories set in a sleepy Long Island suburb. Arranged in
chronological order over the course of a decade or so, the stories
center on -- and are frequently narrated by -- Gretel Samuelson,
who first appears as a precocious adolescent with a deadpan
delivery that brings to mind the baton-twirling delinquent played
by Sissy Spacek in Terrence Malick's ``Badlands.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather was humid and warm; every mosquito in town seemed
to have hatched, and each one was hungry for blood,'' she says in a
typical burst of backyard portentousness. ``It was the sort of
night that feels like a dream, when you're suddenly about to do
things you only thought yourself capable of imagining. Before you
know it you're inside of something that feels as unavoidable as
destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Franconia, Gretel's hometown, is the sort of place where the
summer air smells like cut grass and people sit outside on their
front porches at night, their conversations punctuated by the
chirping of cicadas. Naturally, all hell is breaking loose inside
those picture-perfect little houses, and Gretel's got a nice way of
pointing out the dark side of the so-called good life -- the nut
jobs hanging around the luncheonette, the head of the P.T.A. who
gets hustled off for shock treatments, the divorced woman who cooks
with such passion ``you'd have thought it was the heart of her ex
she was sauteing instead of mushrooms for a strudel.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretel's mother's health is failing, her parents are squaring
off for a messy divorce ``like pit bulls trapped in an L-shaped
living room'' and her brother is about to throw away early
admission to Harvard for a job in the deli department at the Food
Star and a blossoming drug habit. Basically, whatever can go wrong
has -- or is just about to. Even that never-ending cicada song,
Gretel says, ``could lead you to believe little bombs were going
off on your neighbors' front lawns.''
</P>
<P>
   Told in alternating voices, the stories form a scrapbook of
pivotal moments in the lives of Gretel and her nearest and dearest.
In ``Rose Red,'' Gretel and her best friend, Jill, are 12, ``that
unpredictable and dangerous age when sampling shades of lipstick
and playing with dolls seem equally interesting.'' As the stories
unfold, Gretel and Jill trade in their dolls and candy for boys and
beer. In ``True Confession,'' 17-year-old Gretel falls head over
heels in love with the local amphetamine dealer, a smooth talker
who drives a brand-new Camaro and gets her to let him ``do things
she didn't even know people did.'' In ``Fate,'' Jill gets pregnant,
drops out of the 11th grade and marries her dimwitted boyfriend,
Eddie, ``the boy that everyone wanted, but not for keeps.''
</P>
<P>
   Odd mystical moments crop up now and then as Gretel, starved for
miracles, seesaws between wonder and sorrow. In ``Dear Diary,'' she
swears she heard Jill's cat say ``Let me out!'' as it stood at the
kitchen door. In ``How to Talk to the Dead,'' she's positive she
saw her Grandma Frieda's ghost sabotaging her dad's diet by
slipping sticks of butter into his new wife's cooking. Supernatural
walk-ons like these seem calculated to infuse Hoffman's sad-sack
chronicles with a hint of magic realism, but for the most part they
feel forced and out of place.
</P>
<P>
   Originally published in Ladies' Home Journal, Redbook,
Cosmopolitan and Kenyon Review, among others, the stories suffer
from a debilitating overlap when they're read as a collection. As
in a soap opera, where any episode may be the viewer's first,
background information is repeated and characters are reintroduced
ad nauseam, leaving the reader trapped on what feels like a
never-ending receiving line, making the acquaintance of the same
loop of oppressed suburbanites. It's as if Hoffman felt compelled
to back up her car and nose it down the Samuelsons' driveway over
and over again. After a while, you start to wish she knew some
other people in the neighborhood, or at least knew the Samuelsons
well enough to stay a little longer.

 &UR; MY HEART BELONGS TO DA
</P>
<P>
   BY TOBIN HARSHAW
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   I guess it shouldn't be a surprise that an Irishman, especially
one who happens to be a man of the theater, would begin his book
with a small fib. The subtitle of Peter Sheridan's memoir states
that he was ``made'' by his hometown, Dublin, where he was raised
in a small house near the River Liffey, at 44 Seville Place. But
Sheridan could have grown up in a yurt on the Mongolian steppe and
he wouldn't have turned out any differently, so long as he grew up
with his Da. For his father is the black hole by which all energy,
expression and thought in the Sheridan household are consumed,
digested, deconstructed and, most important, judged on their
merits, or conspicuous lack thereof. Luckily for Peter Sheridan --
and the reader -- Da is neither a bitter tyrant nor a drunken sod.
He may be a braggart and a blowhard (``God the Father on the
throne, a bottle of stout for his crozier''), but he is also that
rarest of birds in this age of victimography, a decent man.
</P>
<P>
   As befits the memoir of a leading Irish stage director and
playwright, ``44: Dublin Made Me'' takes a theatrical form. It is a
series of set pieces, all peaking with a bout of hilarity or
aggression or sorrow; and although these sketches never deliver the
emotional climax they strive for, it's still a good deal of fun
never quite getting there. The kitchen of 44 Seville Place is an
ideal proscenium: it's crowded yet comfortable and has a steady
stream of siblings, boarders, neighbors, priests, salesmen and
refugees from the Troubles in Ulster -- in other words, plenty of
character actors against which father and son can play out their
drama.
</P>
<P>
   The lodgers are sufficiently motley. There's Mossie Thomas
Sullivan, a pudgy country bumpkin who walks ``like a farmer
struggling through a wet bog'' but who seems to know when the fix
is in at any race track in Ireland; Noel Dargan, a hulking soldier,
a veteran of the Congo with a 30-inch scar on his leg; Noel's
brother, Liam, who is ``a plasterer, was never anything else, but
wanted to be a drummer in a show band''; and Mahony, an idler who
oversees Da's racing ledger. (``He was as committed as the monks
who created the first Bibles. If it worked out as well as he and Da
hoped, it would be more useful and more valuable than the Book of
Kells.'')
</P>
<P>
   Although he is the second boy among seven children, Peter is
favored over his introspective older brother, Shea (who would grow
up to become the film director Jim Sheridan), and gets to play a
sort of moppet Hermes to his father's tin-pot Zeus. He delivers his
father's meticulously worded notes to shopkeepers. (``He used
bookies' paper for notes because he thought people would take pity
on him and charge less.'') He helps dig up the garage in search of
clogged water pipes and then, after the discovery that the
blueprints have been misread, helps dig it up all over again. He
risks death to install a television antenna on the roof, and later
is nearly demolished by a wayward chimney pot.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, a mother in all this. And she is as saintly
as one would expect. But such mothers spend little time at center
stage, and Sheridan's inability to illustrate her full complexity
is most evident when death strikes the family. Her mourning never
takes on the poignancy of Da's overwhelming grief. Even in their
mutual silence, he drowns her out.
</P>
<P>
   Much to Da's chagrin, the 60's will not be dissuaded from
happening, and the attendant cultural shift corrodes his iron grip
over the family. He can only howl Lear-like into the wind,
insisting that the Beatles are charlatan poseurs, lip-syncing their
way to a fortune. Reconciliation comes when the boys discover the
theater; it is the only one of his sons' interests that Da can't
resist. After all, he raised them to it -- and not even Da could
argue with that.

 &UR; HEARTBREAK HOTELS
</P>
<P>
   BY KAREN KARBO
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Claire Newbold, the rather obviously named heroine of Lisa
Zeidner's subtle, astute new novel (her fourth), is a 41-year-old
medical supplies saleswoman who, after the death of her 3-year-old
son in a car accident and her husband Ken's subsequent short-lived
affair, just fails to come home after a business trip. Claire has
developed a passion for swimming in hotel pools, and one afternoon
simply swims too long and misses her flight. It's a baby step from
here to spending an extra night in her room, even though the front
desk has already automatically checked her out:
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a hard-core wage earner of the type hotel ads target. My
husband was a cardiothoracic surgeon. My wallet was a garden of
credit cards budding possibility, the holographic birds' wings
glinting as if poised for flight. No one would ever suspect me of
fraud, though I knew enough about the rhythms of that hotel, the
staffs' frenzies and downtimes, the secret pockets, to take
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Claire is content to see how long she can squat in a
hotel room without getting caught. She cozies up to the
housekeepers, hatches stories about forgotten keys, snacks on room
service leftovers. Once, the inevitable happens, and she wakes up
late in the morning to see ``a chubby, chinless man in his 50's
with lots of hair'' staring down at her while she sleeps. '' 'I'm
sorry,' he said. 'There must be some mistake.' He held up his key
card, as if to prove that it had admitted him to the room.'' Claire
is amused, unafraid: this is simply one more aspect of her unlikely
voyage to the bottom of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Claire's willful refusal to go home to her husband, her lack of
interest in keeping her appointments, answering her phone messages,
pages, E-mail, are initially liberating. It's relatively easy to
root for her: you go girl! But after she's seduced Zachary, an
18-year-old soon-to-be premed student at Brown, in the pool of the
Four Seasons in Philadelphia -- in part by telling him that she,
and not her husband, is a surgeon -- Claire becomes, even to this
captivated reader, the stereotypical difficult woman. And that's
when ``Layover'' really begins to soar.
</P>
<P>
   There are few aspects of a novel more compelling than watching
the writer go out on a limb, wondering how dare she. Claire's
odyssey of lust, seduction, desire, control -- young Zachary is
just the warm-up -- never veers from what we think of as classic
male acting out, which forces us to examine why we would more
easily accept such behavior in a bereaved father than in a bereaved
mother. Even though the child for whom Claire would be required to
perform her maternal functions is dead, she is still, always, a
mother, which brings up the questions: Why isn't she grieving in a
more acceptable manner? Why isn't she home organizing support
groups or raising money for a preschool scholarship fund endowed in
her deceased child's name? Why isn't she sitting on a bench at a
playground discreetly weeping into her shredded Kleenex?
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Claire hatches schemes to seduce strangers, lies for
days on her bed in her hotel room half-asleep, brooding in a
self-absorbed manner about the connections between sex, maternal
love, disease. She won't return her worried husband's phone calls.
She angles a dinner date with Zachary and Margot, his bitter mess
of a divorced mother, and in a devilishly perfect scene, as rich
and satisfying as the expensive meal the three of them are
consuming at the most exclusive French restaurant in town, Claire
explains it all for Margot:
</P>
<P>
   ``Mar. May I offer a piece of advice? As a still-married woman?
If what you want . . . is to be tenderly held, I can tell you that
you're going about it the wrong way. . . . Certainly you must know
that. Talking so much is one thing. . . . But the neediness! It's
stultifying! Where do you expect to get, presenting yourself like
this? If you think the problem is your body -- your thighs, your
wrinkles -- then work on your body. Lift weights. Do some low-rep
sets two, three times a week. Build bone density. Build
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   People who think about such things differ over which human
condition is the most difficult to write about convincingly.
Religious conversion, quote unquote heart-stopping terror, romantic
love that lasts -- these are all tough, but my vote goes to grief,
particularly the grief of a parent over the loss of a child. What
is there to say other than it's so sad? There is no chance for a
happy ending, ever, when a child has died.
</P>
<P>
   Zeidner knows this, and is both wise and shrewd in depicting her
grief-stricken bad girl, a powerful one-two punch that makes
``Layover'' work. After the death of a child, nothing matters, and
if nothing matters, anything goes. Even if you're a middle-aged,
middle-class woman with good sense and a well-paying job. Or,
perhaps, especially if you're one:
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken and I hadn't gone out much. Without discussion, it had
been clear to both of us that it was pointless, too trashy a
consolation. Nothing like grief to turn to dust the dry, weightless
world of things. Vases, cars, clothes? All husks. Exotic fish and
game in ambrosial sauces, baby greens and out-of-season fruit flown
in with the kind of care reserved for donated organs? Who cares.
Who cares.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it may seem that Claire's voyage is a simple
sexual one, when in fact it's a story of possibilities: what's left
in the world after death? Still, the novel rocks with a lot of
great, sexy scenes, in which Zeidner's fine writing is on glorious
display. There are the expected lyrical erotic bits, but also very
funny moments that roller-coaster from the peak of hilarity to the
low loop of plain truth. When Claire and Zachary are back at her
hotel room after their swim, ostensibly to pick up her running
shoes to go for a run in the park across from the hotel (she
doesn't have any, but invented a pair to get him into her room),
she observes:
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in bathing suits, so the journey to bed shouldn't take
long. I was aware of trying to be perfectly clear about the
invitation, while at the same time hanging back enough so that I
didn't scare him, or repulse him -- I feared that with Let me be
perfectly clear I could seem, coming at him for the kiss, like
Richard Nixon through a fisheye lens, old and hairy, tremulous.''
</P>
<P>
   WITH ``Layover,'' Zeidner joins the ranks of Doris Lessing,
Margaret Atwood and Fay Weldon, all of whom have written in the
women-spiraling-into-madness genre. But Claire is something new.
Unlike would-be female nut cases from an earlier time, she doesn't
set off on her journey needing to shuck her good-wife persona -- as
early as page 17 she admits: ``I was no longer, in some sense, even
a woman. I'd buried myself in work as a man would . . . and
rejected everything frilly, decorative. So I was no longer fragile.
In fact, I felt almost armor-plated, and that's a shame, because
grief at least ought to make you empathetic.'' Not to mention that
she's in her 40's; yet we never for a moment question either her
allure or her own accurate sense of it.
</P>
<P>
   Although Zeidner attempts to tantalize the reader with the
suggestion that Claire may collapse into madness, or even terminal
illness, never to reclaim herself or her life -- there is some
unpersuasive business about a cancer scare near the end, drummed up
by Claire during the height of her disconnectedness -- one of the
most satisfying parts of the novel is the thin line that the author
manages to tread so adroitly. Zeidner pulls no punches; Claire errs
and errs. She is on the verge of being patently insufferable.
Still, we have faith that any woman who is this clever, this smart
about the nature of despair, will somehow pull through. Claire has
gone off the deep end, but we never doubt that she can swim.

 &UR; HANNIBAL THE CANNIBAL
</P>
<P>
   BY STEPHEN KING
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In the dining room, there are flowers and candlelight and
harpsichord music -- ``If Love Now Reigned,'' composed by Henry
VIII in 1510. A woman enters, dressed in a long dinner gown of
cream silk and wearing emerald earrings. Her companion is casual
but elegant in his dark trousers, white shirt and ascot. ``What are
we having?'' the woman asks. Her host, Dr. Lecter -- known in some
quarters as Hannibal the Cannibal -- raises his finger to his lips.
``You never ask,'' he replies. ``It spoils the surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. And what is true of gourmet meals and cannibal feasts is
equally true of the suspense novel: knowing too much beforehand
spoils the surprise. The worst thing I could do is summarize this
novel in any detail, and were I the book's editor, I would argue
very strongly for flap copy consisting of only three words:
</P>
<P>
   ``HERE IT IS.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely that would suffice for Thomas Harris's fans, who have
waited 11 years for the rematch between Clarice Starling, intrepid
F.B.I. agent (``cornpone, but with a little taste''), and Hannibal
Lecter, the great fictional monster of our time. Most of Harris's
devotees have read his entire oeuvre, and why not? Until now it
consisted of only three novels. In a culture where a handful of
popular novelists pump out a book or two a year, producing them
like hormone-juiced hens laying eggs, Harris's rare appearances in
the marketplace make him a singularity: a novelist whose work can
be grasped entire not just by English department profs and
tenure-bound grad students but by the humble folk who entertain
themselves with novels on airplanes and in overcrowded waiting
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Harris is not for all these people, of course -- I don't think
many of the Danielle Steel crowd will be rushing out to buy a book
in which one character is eaten from the inside out by a ravenous
moray eel -- but for those who like what Harris can do so
brilliantly, no book report is required. The readers who have been
waiting for ``Hannibal'' only want to know if it is as good as
``Red Dragon'' and ``The Silence of the Lambs'' (we can exclude
Harris's other novel, a terrorist thriller called ``Black Sunday,''
from this discussion; it seems to have been written before the
author himself clearly understood what he was up to). It is a
pleasure to reply in the negative. No, not as good. This one is
better. It is, in fact, one of the two most frightening popular
novels of our time, the other being ``The Exorcist,'' by William
Peter Blatty. Sequels are usually lame ducks, poor things that are
unable to keep up with their predecessors. ``Hannibal'' is really
not a sequel at all, but rather the third and most satisfying part
of one very long and scary ride through the haunted palace of
abnormal psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
   In the books that form the Lecter trilogy, we see the doctor
take form slowly, advancing from a minor, almost incidental
character in ``Red Dragon'' to a major player in ``The Silence of
the Lambs,'' where his evil and intelligence quickly overshadow the
less interesting presence of Jame Gumb (a serial killer known as
Buffalo Bill because he is reputed to skin his victims), to the
central figure in the book that bears his name. In a late-century
literary landscape where most psycho-villains are little fellows in
rubber masks, armed with knives and burdened with cumbersome sexual
kinks, Dr. Lecter casts a long shadow indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact,'' Harris writes in his carefully measured prose,
``there is no consensus in the psychiatric community that Dr.
Lecter should be termed a man. He has long been regarded by his
professional peers in psychiatry, many of whom fear his acid pen in
the professional journals, as something entirely Other. For
convenience they term him a 'monster.' '' So the word is out, and
it's le mot juste. If Hannibal Lecter isn't a Count Dracula for the
computer-and-cell-phone age, then we don't have one.
</P>
<P>
   HARRIS, the Thomas Pynchon of the popular novel in terms of both
his low visibility and his sparse production, is in charge of his
story and his material from the book's opening: ``Clarice
Starling's Mustang boomed up the entrance ramp at the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms . . . a headquarters rented from the
Rev. Sun Myung Moon in the interest of economy.'' It seems so much
as if he has never been away, even in this first sentence, that one
wonders just why he has been. And, perhaps, where he has been.
</P>
<P>
   If one mourns for the books that might have been during those
years when we have had to put up with pale Lecter-substitutes (one
good rule of thumb for book buyers might be never to buy a novel
with ``In the tradition of'' on the cover), one must also
acknowledge that Harris's antihero has gained an even darker aspect
as a result of his long wait offstage.
</P>
<P>
   No character in popular fiction is as fragile as the monster, or
so prone to losing his pants in his later appearances. Freddy
Krueger is authentically terrifying when he first flashes his
scalpel fingernails in ``A Nightmare on Elm Street,'' but by the
third installment of the series he has become a pal and by the
sixth he has become a joke. In 11 years Hannibal Lecter's notoriety
has grown rather than lessened, and he is no joke -- although, like
all great monsters, he is not without a certain soulless sense of
humor. Barney, his old attendant, recalls Dr. Lecter once saying
that ``whenever it was 'feasible,' he preferred to eat the rude.
'Free-range rude,' he called them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hannibal'' is a novel full of rough bumps and little insights
as sharp as one of the doctor's own needles; Harris observes
America with a cultured civility and perfect grasp of Southern
idiom that only Tom Wolfe can match. And Harris understands plot as
well as language. The result is a book as insightful as ``A Man in
Full,'' but rather more successful; there is never the feeling that
the author is carrying his story on his back like a heavy piece of
furniture, teeth gritted and cords popping out on his neck.
``Hannibal'' is a balloon Harris bats steadily onward, probably
with a grin on his face. The balloon happens to be full of poison
gas and bad dreams, true, but as has been previously suggested,
Harris is not writing for everyone. This is authentic witch's brew,
eye of newt and haunch of redneck, not chicken soup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hannibal'' is a full-out, unabashed horror novel, in other
words. One erstwhile patient of Dr. Lecter's describes how the
doctor persuaded him to peel off his face with a piece of mirror
glass, then feed it to his dogs. This isn't horrible, only gross.
The horror comes when the patient adds, ``They got my nose back
when they pumped the dogs' stomachs at the animal shelter, but the
graft didn't take.'' Yet Harris is also capable of turns of phrase
you won't find in the latest Patricia Cornwell. ``He . . . carried
the scars of a man who, in the haste and fear of his ambition, once
seized his gift by the blade,'' Harris writes of the unfortunate
Florentine policeman who tries to collar Lecter for the reward. Nor
is Harris unaware or unmindful of what our own interest in such
dark fare may mean for our culture and our civilization: ``Now that
ceaseless exposure has calloused us to the lewd and the vulgar, it
is instructive to see what still seems wicked to us. What still
slaps the clammy flab of our submissive consciousness hard enough
to get our attention?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Hannibal Lecter does, for one thing.
</P>
<P>
   Two mountains are likely to arise this summer in the generally
flat topography of the Great American Masscult: George Lucas's
fourth ``Star Wars'' movie and this third episode of Harris's smart
and scary retelling of ``Beauty and the Beast'' (a character in
``Hannibal'' actually notes this similarity, although in an
unfairly dismissive fashion). Lucas's space cadets will most likely
rule the box office, and Harris's lunatics (these include Dr.
Lecter's old friend Sammie, who once put his mother's head in the
church collection plate) will most likely rule the best-seller
lists. Of the two, the novel is the more finely nuanced: ``It was
Krendler's nature to both appreciate Starling's leg and look for
the hamstring.'' It is also the one in which a man is eaten alive
by a pig. In ``The Phantom Menace'' there is mention of the dark
side of the Force; Dr. Hannibal Lecter is that dark side.
</P>
<P>
   IN ``Dracula,'' a singular work of genius by an otherwise
untalented writer, Bram Stoker has the wit to present the count in
one scene as a figure of absurdity -- dressed in a great floppy
planter's hat to ward off the hateful rays of the sun, he appears
at the London docks to personally direct a shipment of the boxes of
earth that will become his bedrooms. The dockworkers pay him and
his gesticulations very little mind, noting only that he speaks
much of ``bloom'' and ``blood.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Hannibal,'' Thomas Harris gives us an equally brilliant
scene as Dr. Lecter -- dressed in a Toronto Maple Leafs hockey
jersey and sneaking back into North America as part of an airborne
tour group -- prepares to dine. After years in a maximum security
cell, he is able to live with his cramped quarters at the rear of
the jumbo jet, and he has trained his mind to deal with the
proximity of so many people (it is their smells that principally
trouble him), but he is unable to bear the thought of eating the
airline food, ``freezing-cold sandwiches of slippery meat.'' He has
thus provided himself with a meal from Fauchon, the Paris caterer:
pate de foie gras and Anatolian figs. He waits ``with the patience
of a python'' for the other passengers to fall asleep, then
stealthily pulls the catered meal out from under his seat and
unties the silk ribbons that hold the box shut. At this point a
little boy, who has been observing him all the while, cozens the
monster out of his meal, mistaking the pate for a liverwurst
sandwich without the bread and gobbling it down greedily. It is a
wonderful moment, a comic ray of light that makes the darkness of
Dr. Lecter's heart and mind all the blacker.
</P>
<P>
   Is this the end for the doctor and the F.B.I. agent? Harris is
crafty enough to leave the door to a fourth installment open, but
just a crack. I hope with all my heart that he will write again,
and sooner rather than later -- novels that so bravely and cleverly
erase the line between popular fiction and literature are very much
to be prized -- but I would rather see him bar this door and go
down a different corridor. Familiarity, even with a monster, breeds
contempt. As it is, I like to think of Dr. Lecter in his Maple
Leafs warm-up jersey, losing his carefully husbanded gourmet meal
to the little boy. He takes the loss quite well, I might add. Even
genially. Why, a man like that could steal your heart. Not to
mention your liver . . . your sweetbreads . . . your.

 A CLEARING IN THE DISTANCE
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frederick Law Olmsted and America in the Nineteenth Century.
</P>
<P>
   By Witold Rybczynski.
</P>
<P>
   Scribner. $28.
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; SCAPE ARTIST
</P>
<P>
   BY SUZANNA LESSARD
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   There is a simplicity, a generosity and, above all, a kind of
modesty in Frederick Law Olmsted that is rare in men of great gift.
In a portrait of him by John Singer Sargent he stands among
blooming laurel, dogwood and rhododendron -- the materials of his
trade -- leaning on a cane, an old man yet with a freshness about
him that is almost childlike. He stands fully in the light: there
is nothing hidden here. Even the blue sky glimpsed through leaves,
painted with frank, modern brushstrokes, is just the sky of the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Witold Rybczynski, who is a professor of urbanism at the
University of Pennsylvania and has written eight books, including
``City Life'' and ``Home: The Short History of an Idea,'' also
reflects Olmsted's character in the style in which he renders him
in his excellent biography, ``A Clearing in the Distance.'' It's a
straightforward work, thorough and respectful, yet easeful in a way
that is reminiscent of Olmsted himself.
</P>
<P>
   Olmsted was born in Hartford in 1822. When he was 3 his mother
died, and there was then a stepmother and other children while he
was sent away to a series of rather odd schools, an experience that
left him susceptible to depression and gave him a taste for
solitary rambles in the New England landscape. But there is little
of the tortured soul about Olmsted. On the contrary, a kind of
acceptance of life as it is dealt to him seems to underlie even
those black moods that occasionally beset him. His father, a
dry-goods merchant, was a loving man and patient with this son, who
seemed directionless for a long time, first trying farming (Father
bought the farms), then going to sea, then reporting extensively on
slavery in the South, publishing several books and eventually going
into publishing himself. Though a handsome young man of good
family, Olmsted had as much trouble finding a wife as he had
settling on an occupation. In the end he married his brother John's
widow, with whom he raised several children and stepchildren; he
was a faithful husband, albeit one who was often taken away from
his family by work.
</P>
<P>
   In 1857, Olmsted managed to wangle a job as superintendent of
the Central Park, as it was then called, in New York, a project
that was just getting under way. A publishing venture had failed,
and he was personally in debt. When the architect Calvert Vaux
suggested that they enter the competition for the job of actually
designing the park, he agreed: it is typical of Olmsted that he
fell by happenstance into the work at which he became a genius. The
jury was divided between Democrats, who, paradoxically, were
attracted to formal European designs, and Republicans, who liked
the English picturesque style that Olmsted had studied intensively
in travels abroad. The Republicans were in the majority, and they
all picked the submission by Olmsted and Vaux.
</P>
<P>
   Struggles with bureaucrats were to dog Olmsted all his days. At
one hearing an important witness said: ``Oh, damn the landscape! .
. . We don't know anything about your landscape, and we don't know
what landscape has to do with the matter before us.'' Indifference
to his talent, sometimes verging on abuse, may be in part why for a
long time Olmsted himself didn't think of landscape design as a
legitimate profession. The frustrations over Central Park dragged
on for years and drove him to quit or threaten to quit several
times. This was Olmsted's first attempt at landscape architecture,
and the result was the treasure New Yorkers could not live without.
</P>
<P>
   Olmsted occupied his point in time as if it were a hospitable
New England mountaintop from which he could see back into the past
and forward to the future with equal, matter-of-fact ease. He lived
in the Gilded Age but was in no way infected by its excesses or
infatuated with its imperialistic and aristocratic dreams. He
believed in the restorative power of landscape for ordinary people.
In a time of neo-classical fervor, he disliked straight lines. He
loved contrasting textures, but it was a cardinal rule with him to
blur the boundaries. The architecture of Europe impressed him, but
trees were his true love.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the humble way Olmsted wore his talent could
be that landscape design came to him so naturally. He mapped out a
city plan for all of Buffalo in a couple of hours. In 1877, when he
was handed the project of designing a park for Montreal's Mont
Royal, a steep outcropping of traprock in the middle of the city,
he at first expressed ``diffidence in my ability to do justice to
so unusual a problem,'' but once he took on the job the design
seems to have fallen into place with a kind of inevitability. The
ease can be almost disappointing: one wishes to know more about the
evolution of these beautiful common grounds that have come to have
such meaning to us all.
</P>
<P>
   In Olmsted's midlife, work came to him plentifully, but power
politics and budgets that had a tendency to dry up continued to
plague him. The decision of a Buffalo official to build his own
house in the middle of a public green is an example of the sort of
obstruction to his vision that he frequently encountered. In that
case Olmsted prevailed. But when Leland Stanford started imposing
his own ideas on the plans for Stanford University -- usually
last-minute inspirations based on things he and his wife had seen
on a trip to Europe -- Olmsted was furious and withdrew. Rarely did
he have a free hand. An exception was Biltmore, George Vanderbilt's
estate in North Carolina, the setting in which Sargent painted him.
</P>
<P>
   It was not long after that painting was done that Olmsted, at
71, began to exhibit the symptoms of what seems to be Alzheimer's
disease. As soon as he understood the seriousness of his
impairment, he began to turn the reins over to his stepson John.
Later he was encouraged to go to Maine: from a house on Penobscot
Bay he wrote long letters daily about the details of the firm's
business. His decline was relentless, however. He died in 1903 at
the age of 81.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Rybczynski identifies the key quality that underlies
Olmsted's success -- a ``long-headedness,'' as a contemporary
called it, the patience and ability to make plans that will not
come to fruition for decades and will hold up over centuries. The
second quality is one he ``inherited'' from Lancelot (Capability)
Brown, the great 18th-century English landscape architect, so
nicknamed for his practice of always working with the capability of
a site. ``It would be wasteful to try to make anything else than a
mountain of it,'' Olmsted advised the commissioners at Montreal,
whereas in Prospect Park, his masterpiece, he relied on what he
described as the ``three grand elements of pastoral landscape'' --
that is, meadows, forest and water, with which he manufactured
scenic effects.
</P>
<P>
   The author has written a transparent book, in which he is a
largely retiring but very pleasant guide. Every so often, however,
he steps forward in a delightful, casual way, clambering through
the underbrush looking for a place where Olmsted once lived, for
example, or referring to experiences of his own in order to
interpret Olmsted's choices. Another device, used sparingly, is
passages in italics in which he describes Olmsted in a particular
location at a particular moment and imagines, as a novelist would,
what is going on in Olmsted's mind. At first these passages struck
me as almost amateurish, and at odds with the disciplined
transparency, but I came to look forward to them, in particular for
the way in which they evoke place, so much a key to Olmsted's
sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   Olmsted's vision was essentially a suburban one. He was happiest
living in Brookline, Mass., one of the first suburbs in America. He
saw nature as a kind of raw material to be shaped in a sensitive
way, always in relation to man's world and yet also gracefully
hiding that world. In this he was a man for today. What got lost
between then and the suburban present is the sensitivity: the
artificial curves of roads in suburban developments, for example,
are derived from Olmstedian innovations, but on his plans the
curves were barely perceptible. And of course the creation of
common land, essential to his vision, also fell by the wayside.
Today there is a profound contempt for suburbia in the world of
high design, which has abandoned the territory almost completely to
developers. Nevertheless, more than half of the population of the
United States now chooses to live in suburbia, and behind that fact
and the problems that it poses looms the legacy of this quiet
giant.

 &UR; LOCAL JUSTICE
</P>
<P>
   BY SARA MOSLE
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Now, here's a premise for a novel. In the early 1970's, a boy
named Hadrian Coleman fatally shoots a powerful judge in East Texas
and then scratches the dead man's eyes out with a broken whisky
bottle. The crime is so heinous that the boy, although just 15
years old, is tried as an adult, convicted and sentenced to 50
years in the state penitentiary. A decade and a half later, he wins
parole, but a few weeks before his release, he commits another
murder, this time of a fellow inmate. Afraid of spending the rest
of his life behind bars, he escapes from the most secure prison in
Texas, embarrasses the state's correctional system by eluding a
manhunt and is on the lam for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   So far so good. Then, however, Hadrian is suddenly pardoned,
while still at large, by the governor of Texas _ this in a state
with perhaps the harshest criminal justice system in the country _
at the apparent behest of Sonny Hope, the head of the Hope Farm
state penitentiary, who it just so happens, in a secret to no one,
was the escaped convict's best childhood friend. In other words, in
a deal that stinks to high heaven. It would never happen.
</P>
<P>
   No governor _ certainly no governor of Texas _ would ever risk
looking so ridiculously soft on crime by pardoning, out of the
blue, an escaped two-time murderer, and certainly not to appease
some two-bit state official with no campaign money to donate and no
constituency to speak of.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the novel opens with Hadrian picking up his pardon papers at
Sonny Hope's mansion, where he's welcomed with open arms and asked
to recount his escape by gleeful prison officials. Hasn't anyone in
these parts ever heard of the appearance of impropriety?
</P>
<P>
   But if you can get past this gargantuan leap of logic, Robert
Draper's first book, ``Hadrian's Walls,'' is actually a deft,
occasionally ingenious novel, doing for sadistic prison officials
what Donna Tartt's ``Secret History'' did for murderous college
cliques: making them seem, if only momentarily, far more appealing
than you ever thought they could be.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, a reporter gets nosy about the goings-on in
Shepherdsville, a fictional stand-in for Huntsville, a prison
community of 35,000 north of Houston, on the edge of East Texas'
Pine Curtain.
</P>
<P>
   The pardon, at first glance, appears to correct an earlier
injustice: Hadrian killed the judge to defend Sonny, whom the judge
had tried to seduce and then murder when his advance was spurned.
But Sonny inexplicably let his friend take the rap for the murder
without providing exculpatory testimony. (There's a homophobic
assumption underlying the plot: Sonny couldn't afford even an
unwanted association with homosexuality or his life would be
ruined.)
</P>
<P>
   Sonny's father, who is the prison warden before Sonny succeeds
him, tries to make it up to Hadrian, as he serves his time, by
giving him a work detail in his mansion.
</P>
<P>
   The two boys _ one free, one not _ grow up together and,
stretching all credulity, remain friends. Sonny courts and marries
a gorgeous local girl, whom Hadrian also loves. Pained by his
proximity to freedom, Hadrian finally forgoes his mansion
privileges to live like any other convict.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Sonny, revealing his true character, becomes
warden after betraying his father. Later, he wants Hadrian to repay
the favor of the pardon by killing for him again _ this time, Ricky
Tempesta, a sleazy former con who is threatening to run Sonny out
of business by opening a private prison next door in Trust, Tex.
(Some of the novel's most hilarious bits involve Tempesta's
marketing of his prison: ``Why We Need Trust.'')
</P>
<P>
   More than half the novel is devoted to Hadrian's tedious
agonizing over whether he owes it to Sonny to commit the murder.
It's hard figuring out why Hadrian has ever felt any loyalty to
Sonny _ particularly after serving 15 years' hard time.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, everyone's devotion to Sonny _ his father's, the girl's,
other prison officials' _ is pretty inexplicable. Even in Draper's
sympathetic portrait, he comes across as completely odious.
</P>
<P>
   Draper has found a modern Texas subject that is fresh and
fertile: the exponential growth of the state's prison system and
the rise of towns whose entire economies depend, with creepy
exploitation, on incarceration. Draper covered the Texas prison
system for Texas Monthly, and the novel borrows heavily from a long
piece that he wrote for the magazine on Andy Collins, the former
director of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, who was
ousted for corruption and is an obvious model for Sonny Hope.
</P>
<P>
   The novel, however, goes wrong precisely where it departs from
the real story. In the Texas Monthly article, Collins comes across
as something of a buffoon: a glad-handing, frat-boy bureaucrat with
all the charm of a used car salesman. In the novel, however, Draper
is gunning for more significance, for literature with a capital L.
He wants Sonny to be a kind of Governor Stanton, a tragic, flawed
figure who still inspires epic loyalty. But such men usually don't
end up as lifers in the Texas Department of Corrections. Hadrian,
in turn, is less a Texan than the Southern innocent, displaying a
wide-eyed navete that is completely incongruous with his
circumstances. The guy, after all, rather gratuitously gouged a
man's eyes out and then was raised by the state pen. Hasn't Draper
ever read ``The Executioner's Song''?
</P>
<P>
   Draper is guilty of a kind of Texas Uncle Tomism: playing up to
the literary establishment's stereotypes of what Texas regional
color should be. But he never gets past the cliches to conjure up a
real place and time. His descriptions are mostly stock images from
Southern literature. There's the wild, untamed nature: ``The river
exists in no postcard. Even on the calmest of evenings, it froths
and flails like the devil's own handmaiden.'' There's the emphasis
on patriarchy and the hammy folk wisdom: ``But your daddy, 'course
you know, if pure stubbornness is strength why then he's stronger'n
Nellie's breath.'' There's even the obligatory lesson about race.
At one point, Hadrian's father invites his young son onto the
family porch to shame some Ku Klux Klan members with his innocence.
The scene is straight out of ``To Kill a Mockingbird.''
</P>
<P>
   There's tragedy in the Texas prison system, but Draper doesn't
find it here. The novel's best bits are his sharp satire of
Tempesta and Trust, and the whole prison industry. Indeed, there's
a great comic novel struggling to get out of ``Hadrian's Wall,''
but instead Draper gives us an implausible thriller. He wants us to
believe that prison officials have the grandeur of ``The
Godfather.'' But these guys are the Sopranos.

   The Untold Story of
</P>
<P>
   Harry T. Moore, America's First Civil Rights Martyr.

 &UR; FIGHTING JIM CROW
</P>
<P>
   BY ADAM NOSSITER
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Before Medgar Evers and Martin Luther King Jr., there was an
obscure black civil rights campaigner in rural Florida who worked
in little towns like Live Oak, Titusville and Groveland, and who
believed fervently in equality and democracy. Like those men and
many others, Harry T. Moore paid with his life, killed in a bombing
attack on Christmas Day, 1951, that was never solved.
</P>
<P>
   Almost completely forgotten by posterity, Moore was a victim
twice over. He doesn't even figure on the Civil Rights Memorial in
Montgomery, Ala., although he was every bit as courageous as those
who do. Ben Green, a freelance writer, speculates in ``Before His
Time'' that Moore came along too early, before the country's
attention was focused on civil rights. Perhaps. But the legacy of
this upright schoolteacher may also have been diminished by his
context: a state that, partly thanks to experienced self-promotion,
is not usually associated with the worst excesses of Jim Crowism.
</P>
<P>
   That reputation is only half deserved. Moore, the N.A.A.C.P.'s
first full-time, paid state executive director in the country, was
operating in a tough, dark place. Florida was third in the country
in lynchings, after Mississippi and Georgia; the Ku Klux Klan had
infested the ranks of local politicians, businessmen and police
officers; and the state's leaders were hardly sympathetic to civil
rights complaints. It may not have been Mississippi, but for a
black ``troublemaker'' like Moore, it was a place where nighttime
car rides easily became something worse.
</P>
<P>
   So we can only share the author's admiration for his subject's
singular achievement. In the late 1930's and 40's, Moore was
putting himself bravely on the front line, suing to get equal pay
for black teachers, starting voter registration drives (by the time
of his death Florida's black registration was years ahead of that
of other Southern states) and firing off angry letters to the
state's governor about the latest atrocity. Unlike those civil
rights leaders who came after, he had no national media to
publicize his cause and no sympathetic Northern whites to help
finance him. And in the end he was abandoned even by his own
organization, the N.A.A.C.P., as the author makes plain.
</P>
<P>
   Like Evers, Moore was inspired by his country's fight in World
War II, goaded by the terrible gap between the ideals of democracy
and the reality of the Jim Crow system. True to the N.A.A.C.P.
tradition, Moore was no radical. He was reassuring to the few
whites bold enough to ally themselves with him. One wrote to Gov.
Millard Caldwell that Moore was a ``sane, conservative, intelligent
Negro . . . and is as far from Socilistic [sic], Communistic or
radical beliefs as either you or I.''
</P>
<P>
   Why was he killed? In the years before his death, he had played
an outspoken role in a kind of Florida Scottsboro case, in which
several young blacks accused of rape were brutally beaten, and he
had helped get a more sympathetic county commissioner elected in
Brevard County, where he lived. Ominously, a neighboring county
seethed with Klansmen, including a county commissioner, a city
manager and numerous police officers. There were plenty of people
with ample motive to place a bomb under the house of the
``troublemaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Green has performed a valuable service in bringing attention
once more to this courageous man. He does a good job of conjuring
up the bug-infested, sweaty towns that are the backdrop. The story
is dramatic because of its very obscurity. But this book is flawed
by a tendency toward hyperbole (starting with the subtitle: it
seems unlikely that Moore was America's ``first'' civil rights
martyr) and cliche. Mobs are ``unruly'' and poverty is
``grinding.'' And Green, in researching his book, has spent too
much time listening to doubtful theories about Moore's death in the
furtive world of former Klansmen, whose entire reason for existing
is to get drunk and talk.

 A BETTER WAR
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Unexamined Victories and Final Tragedy of America's Last
Years in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   By Lewis Sorley.
</P>
<P>
   Harcourt Brace &AMP; Company. $28.

   -----
 &UR; UNSUNG VICTORIES
</P>
<P>
   BY JEFFREY RECORD
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Sorley believes that the United States had won the Vietnam
War by the end of 1971. ``Not only was the internal war against
subversion and the guerrilla threat won, so was that against the
external conventional threat -- in the terms specified by the
United States.'' Those terms were continued American financial and
logistical assistance to Saigon and, once American ground forces
had departed, renewed air support of South Vietnam's ground forces
if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Better War'' is a comprehensive and long-overdue examination
of the immediate post-Tet offensive years, perhaps the most
fascinating years of the war. A first-rate historian and a
third-generation West Point graduate who served in Vietnam, Sorley
focuses on what was indeed the remarkable military improvement of
the South Vietnamese after Tet.
</P>
<P>
   Two main keys, he says, unlocked progress in what until mid-1968
had been a stalemated war. The first was a new American military
strategy devised by Gen. Creighton Abrams, who succeeded the
discredited William Westmoreland as commander of United States
forces in Vietnam. Abrams, who recognized the inseparability of the
war's political and military dimensions, replaced his predecessor's
stupid and wasteful attrition strategy with one that concentrated
on population protection. The second key was a reorganized and
accelerated pacification program directed by William Colby.
</P>
<P>
   Working closely with President Nguyen Van Thieu of South
Vietnam, Abrams and Colby crushed what remained of the Vietcong and
their political and military infrastructure after the Tet
offensive. It was an impressive triumph, perhaps even
extraordinary, given its accomplishment against a backdrop of
capricious White House oversight, relentless United States troop
withdrawals and collapsing public support for further American
involvement in Vietnam. One wonders what course the war might have
taken had Abrams been appointed military commander in 1964 instead
of Westmoreland, whom Sorley rightly tags as a major contributor to
``the squandering of literally years of substantial support from
the American public, Congress and even media.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanoi, however, had an obvious alternative to its defeated
guerrilla option in the South: a straightforward conventional
invasion. And it was this option that it pursued in 1972 and again
in 1975. The first invasion, the so-called Easter offensive, was
finally stopped largely by a huge United States aerial
counterattack. The second invasion, which the Communists called
``Our Great Spring Offensive,'' decisively defeated South Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Yet how does one explain Saigon's fall when, according to
Sorley, we had won the war by late 1971? He blames the United
States, more specifically Congress, for defaulting on Nixon's
secret pledges to Saigon of continued military assistance,
including air strikes. But, surely, there was more to it than that.
First of all, the war that Abrams and Colby won was not the
conventional war to come, but rather the original insurgent war.
Second, no American President can or should expect unconditional
Congressional support for a costly, seemingly endless war fought in
a remote place on behalf of largely abstract objectives.
</P>
<P>
   Most important was South Vietnam's political illegitimacy and
military weakness. From its inception, the Republic of Vietnam
could not escape its identity as a cold war creation of the United
States. Ultimately, probably no amount of American air power and
arms assistance could have saved a Government that by 1975
consisted of little more than a professionally feckless oligarchy
of corrupt senior military officers masquerading as a sovereign
state. When the end came, the South Vietnamese armed forces, with
almost $6 billion worth of American weapons, simply broke and ran.

   The Middle East in a Troubled Age.

 &UR; THE PROMISED LAND
</P>
<P>
   BY MAX RODENBECK
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Iran's Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance narrowly escaped
impeachment last month. Religious conservatives were out for his
blood, accusing him of allowing ``perversion and filth'' to spread
in the Islamic Republic. The Minister's winning defense was simple.
Although Iran's 1979 constitution forbids the undermining of
Islamic principles, he said, legislators have never defined what
exactly those principles are.
</P>
<P>
   This would surprise the many Americans who tend to regard Islam
as a monolithic faith with inflexible rules. It would not surprise
R. Stephen Humphreys. The clash between ideals of Islamic
governance and the practical difficulty of applying them is exactly
the sort of Middle Eastern conundrum he neatly exposes in this
refreshingly forthright collection of essays.
</P>
<P>
   A professor of Islamic history at the University of California,
Santa Barbara, Humphreys brings a historian's deep and
dispassionate perspective to the modern Middle East. In ``Between
Memory and Desire,'' he poses incisive questions, elaborates
convincing arguments and does not shy from tackling the prickliest
of topics. All this is achieved with an eye for telling detail and
a concise style that is rare in academic writing.
</P>
<P>
   Students of the region will find little that is really new here.
What they will find is an admirably succinct exposition of key
issues. These range from the failure of Arab state building to the
failure of Arabs and Israelis really to come to terms to the
failure of modern Islamists to forge a practical social and
political program.
</P>
<P>
   That is a lot of failure, and indeed the picture that emerges is
a somber one. ``Life is full of surprises,'' Humphreys writes,
``but a betting man would wager that the Middle East will be living
with the current legacy of rapid population growth and economic
frustration for decades to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Few who know the region would seriously dispute this judgment.
Levels of unemployment are dangerously high, even in relatively
successful economies like Israel's. Such vital resources as arable
land and water are scarce. A lack of popular legitimacy makes most
governments shaky and intolerant of dissent. Middle Eastern states
are only just beginning to adopt policies likely to stimulate rapid
economic growth, which is ultimately the only way they will manage
to accommodate the thousands of youths entering the job market
every year.
</P>
<P>
   What Humphreys might have added is that the Middle East's
frightening population growth rates have plummeted in the past
decade. In fact, the region is experiencing a profound demographic
transition. Recent research has shown that similar transitions
helped fuel economic booms in both 19th-century Europe and east
Asia during the 1970's. Not only will fewer students be entering
the Middle East's overburdened educational systems, but the
proportion of working-age people to dependents will rise, creating
a far more productive balance. The countries where these trends are
most pronounced -- Morocco, Egypt and Tunisia -- are already
attractive emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   But if demographic pressures are easing, there is still plenty
of room for pessimism. The region's most serious challenges lie
less in economics than in perceptions, habits and attitudes. This
is the realm ``between memory and desire,'' the apt phrase
Humphreys has borrowed from Eliot's ``Wasteland.'' It is on this
intangible plane that the author is at his best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Memory in the Middle East,'' Humphreys says, ``tends to be
embodied in myth rather than history.'' Excepting the very new
school of Israeli revisionist historians, the region as a whole has
made only feeble efforts to scrutinize its own past objectively.
The absence of a solid understanding opens history to manipulation
and distortion -- a very serious thing considering that memory,
according to Humphreys, is what identifies goals and purposes for
the future.
</P>
<P>
   Arab memories, for example, are often consumed by a sense of
having fallen from grace, of having declined ever since Islam's
spectacular efflorescence in the seventh and eighth centuries. The
politicization of Islam in recent years has exaggerated this
feeling, since fundamentalists hold the early years of Islam to be
a perfect model for society in all ages. Scholars who seek to probe
and challenge this construct are now exposed to charges of
betraying their faith. Without free investigation of Islam's
history, Humphreys suggests, there can be little hope of either
renewal or reform.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the historical memory of both Israelis and
Palestinians is so clouded by their own national tragedies that the
two peoples rarely pause to consider how to accommodate each other.
As Humphreys observes of the Israelis, much of their ``memory'' of
injustice is simply misdirected toward their neighbors. Zionism is
strictly a product of European conditions, he says. Far from being
grounded in age-old hatreds, the Arab-Israeli struggle ``is
decisively a 20th-century conflict, and biblical or Koranic texts
are relevant only insofar as they are used to sanctify ideas and
standpoints whose roots lie in modern times.''
</P>
<P>
   Humphreys is equally dismissive of many Western myths regarding
the Middle East. The idea of mad dictators driven by irrational
rage is one such shibboleth. In a persuasive series of analyses, he
shows how seemingly self-destructive policies are nearly always
founded in perfectly rational choices. For example, Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini's support for the students who held hostages at
the United States Embassy for 444 days may have isolated Iran in
the world, but it also enabled Khomeini to clinch his grip on power
at a critical juncture in the Islamic revolution. While admiring of
such tactics, Humphreys is hardly sentimental. Khomeini, he says,
was ``militant, vindictive, sure of Islam's enemies but not of what
he hoped to build.''
</P>
<P>
   Humphreys concludes his demolition of the mad dictator myth in
typically pithy fashion. ``The problem for us is not that the goals
of Middle Eastern leaders are impenetrable; most of the time they
are quite transparent. The problem is simply that these goals are
not the ones that we want them to have.'' A wealth of observations
like this place Humphreys's work in the best tradition of writing
on foreign cultures. Objective yet sympathetic, scholarly yet
accessible, his book ends up revealing as much about our own
society as about those it describes.

 &UR; TAKE MY WIFE, S'IL VOUS PLAIT
</P>
<P>
   BY DAVID SACKS
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Defiantly wordy yet sensible in its message, the very title of
Michael Foley's eloquent novel hints at the flaws and strengths
within. The plot of ``Getting Used to Not Being Remarkable''
involves three powerful themes: (a) the grind and compromises of
midlife vs. the proud expectations of youth, (b) the tension of
being Irish in England and (c) adultery. Foley's treatment of them
proves by turns poignant, funny, informative and annoyingly
evasive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a low opinion of schoolteachers,'' his narrator, Martin
Ward, tells us at the outset. ``I was a schoolteacher. Also a
scientist trained in logic. From early youth my head teemed with
syllogisms -- but still I was incapable of drawing an obvious
conclusion. It was a long time before I developed a low opinion of
myself.'' Martin is full of contradictions. Arrogant, aloof, yet
obedient and conformist, he finds both safety and shame in being
underemployed, teaching science at a (vividly sketched) Roman
Catholic girls' school in London, circa 1979. Equally discontented
is Martin's wife, Clare, who looks after their two small children
and works part time as a private nurse. Harried and cash-poor, the
couple squabble.
</P>
<P>
   Martin has rejected the promising future he once faced as a
brilliant, cocky physics student in Northern Ireland in the 1960's.
In his family's convention-bound, middle-class Catholic enclave, he
had seemed destined for a plum corporate research job or a
prestigious post as a university lecturer. Instead, as he puts it,
``the great Martin Ward'' became ``a teacher like everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   For escape, he reads 19th-century decadent French poets,
particularly ``the Magnificent Seven -- Baudelaire, Flaubert,
Rimbaud, Lautreamont, Huysmans, Barbey d'Aurevilly and Villiers de
l'Isle Adam.'' They excite him with their hatred of authority,
exaltation of individualism and variously extreme reactions to the
church. The novel is sprinkled with brief translations from the
Seven, representing Martin's glosses on his momentary feelings, on
what's happening around him.
</P>
<P>
   It's not long before we've seen enough of Martin's peevish
self-absorption to sympathize with Clare -- and to understand why
she falls into bed with a rebellious Londoner named Nick. And when
Martin gives the affair his blessing, we also understand that he's
trying to follow the Seven's subversive ideals, with Clare as his
Emma Bovary.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Martin secretly exults in Clare's infidelity: ``I too
was free. We could both cut school. . . . If I had had a fling it
would have shattered Clare's frail confidence and plunged her into
despair. She, on the other hand, could take us both along on her
freedom dash.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting Used to Not Being Remarkable'' combines two
alternating narratives. The ``now'' thread presents Martin's crisis
in London, over the course of about seven months. The ``then''
thread spans his hopeful teen-age years and coming of age in
Londonderry. This back-and-forth tactic can yield wonderfully
bittersweet results. For example, we see the young Martin at a
dance, first meeting a mysterious, knowing 15-year-old Clare, and
then, a few pages later, we see Clare, the disenchanted wife,
admitting that she's grown more serious about Nick. The Northern
Ireland sections also offer local color and a telling portrait of
Martin's high-toned, anxious mother, who inspires his fear of
intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Foley, despite his obvious gifts, has assembled
too many elements to create a gripping plot. The novel's most
arresting feature -- a cynical husband facing unconventional
choices in dealing with his wife's adultery -- goes neglected amid
Martin's overheated daily perceptions, accounts of his youthful
adventures and digressions on French poets. Despite two splendidly
eerie scenes revealing Clare's deft manipulation of her cuckolded
husband, the whole adultery story line stays reined in. Martin's
reactions remain passive, his feelings shallow. We're told that he
is angry, but he seems to worry more about his thwarted marital
rights than about the possibility of losing his children.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the author is poking fun at, even punishing, Martin
for his ineffectual pride. As the two narratives move toward twin
resolutions, there emerges in each a more mature Martin, ready for
the next stage of life. ``I was not a remarkable person,'' the
adult Martin touchingly concludes. If only he could have been given
a more remarkable way of getting there.

 &UR; AS THE FOCUS GROUP GOES, SO GOES THE NATION
</P>
<P>
   BY ANDREW SULLIVAN
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``When a man can take a poll and tell what everybody is
thinking, that means nobody is really thinking anymore,'' Marshall
McLuhan wrote back in 1951, recapitulating Gertrude Stein. McLuhan
never knew Dick Morris, but he laid the basis for understanding
him. Morris's candid book about the machinery of professional
politics is premised on an absence of thought deeper, though, than
McLuhan -- or indeed anyone only a decade ago -- could have
predicted. Morris's sense of history extends to a psephological
grasp of the last 50 years of domestic politics, and his broader
learning amounts to a smattering of Churchill quotations and
homilies from the musical ``Annie.'' His philistinism, by which I
mean his complete unconcern for the highest goals of any society,
is so complete it is fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   Take the substance of what Morris has helped turn our politics
into. This is what Morris calls ``issues.'' According to ``The New
Prince,'' issues -- not spin, not character, not charisma -- get
candidates elected and keep them in power. What the issues are,
however, has nothing to do with a judgment of what the country
needs, what history demands or what a politician's accumulated set
of principles intimates. What the issues are is determined
primarily by polling: ``The icons of the past relied on political
instinct. Now, Presidents can use scientific polls and focus
groups. I fail to see the difference.'' The use of the right issues
in the right way enables a President to stay popular, and this is
important because, without popularity, he is not really President:
``An elected executive -- whether President, governor or mayor --
needs a popular majority every day in his term. . . . When he dips
below 50 percent, he is functionally out of office.'' So much for
elections, electoral colleges or, for that matter, the
Constitution. What matters, when one peels away the political
onion, is the nightly tracking poll.
</P>
<P>
   The actual content of the issues is as irrelevant as the formal
powers of the Constitution. ``Take whatever position you want, but
do take a position, because once you do, ample money awaits you on
either side,'' Morris advises would-be candidates. (Someone should
inscribe that sentence on Bill Clinton's Presidential library.) The
only indispensable thing is flexibility. The key for those on the
right, Morris argues, is to co-opt the strongest issues of the
left, whatever they may be at the time. And the key for the left is
to neutralize the strongest areas of the right, whatever they may
be. So we end up with a millennial race in which Tweedle-A and
Tweedle-B distinguish themselves by careful platitudes that are
determined in advance by the wrists of wired focus groups.
</P>
<P>
   This, Morris argues, is an entirely good thing. And it does not,
he protests, lead to apathy. Although 40 percent of the electorate
couldn't care less about politics, the 60 percent who are involved
-- the retired C-Span addicts, readers of Brill's Content and
surfers of the Drudge Report -- are more sophisticated than any
electorate in history. This means that the politician must be
forever inventive (``The roaches have developed an immunity to this
year's roach spray,'' in Morris's felicitous metaphor), but it also
means that the future of America's direct democracy -- a kind of
plebiscitary Internet chat room -- is, in Morris's eyes, bright.
The premise in all this is that liberal democracy succeeds when it
most perfectly reflects the will of the majority. What is new in
our politics is merely the technical means to discern that will
with ever greater precision at any given moment. The notion that
liberal democracy might be concerned with the minority, or the
individual, or even the rule of law, does not seem to have occurred
to Morris.
</P>
<P>
   But if Morris's book is sometimes chilling, it is also often
acute. Many of his micro-observations, like many of his master's
micro-policies, are on the mark. He is underwhelmed by the power of
special interest groups, and he doesn't buy the notion that the
sound-bite culture inherently degrades political discourse (``There
is literally no such thing as an idea that cannot be expressed well
and articulately to today's voters in 30 seconds''). He's
persuasively dismissive of the powers of spin (take that, George!)
and imaginative when it comes to policy prescriptions, even though
they are generally of the metal-detectors-in-schools variety. But
he has no clue about foreign policy -- he thinks Americans will
support interventions only if they are geared to protecting
children. And the amoralism is ubiquitous. Morris eschews racism,
for example, as an electoral tactic not because it is beneath him
but because it ``doesn't work.'' Oh well, times change.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it no longer surprises that this kind of politics was
perfected by a Democratic President and defended by the Democratic
Party. The merit of Russell Jacoby's new book is that it asks us to
place the politics of Morris's Clinton (and Clinton's Morris) in
the context of the intellectual collapse of the left. Jacoby, a
social historian, clearly thinks the two phenomena are related. And
he has something of a point.
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby's premise is that the American left has had the stuffing
knocked out of it by the last 10 years. The implosion of Communism
has deeply undermined milder forms of redistributionism, and the
stagnation of the social democratic countries in Europe has robbed
liberals of any real alternative to Rubinomics. The result is a
capitulation to conservative social and economic policy in both
Britain and the United States. Jacoby is right, if unoriginal, in
pointing out how thorough an abandonment of liberal utopianism this
represents. But he is smartest in seeing how the liberal
intelligentsia accelerated the process.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S refreshing to read ``The End of Utopia'' because the kind
of left-wing tradition Jacoby revels in -- a defense both of high
culture and of a genuinely democratic politics -- is, to all
intents and purposes, extinct. His disgust at the shallowness of
``multiculturalism'' is matched only by his frustration at the
alleged end of ideology. His hero is Matthew Arnold, the Victorian
inspector of public schools, the defender of sweetness and light
but the opponent of aristocratic privilege. ``That people are equal
and should be treated equally,'' Jacoby argues, ``is one matter;
that their thoughts and activities are equal is another.'' The way
in which academic liberals have come to fetishize popular culture
and relativize morality strikes him not as an evolution of
liberalism but as its disintegration. Obscurantist cultural studies
and the blather of communitarianism are, for him, merely two sides
of the same pitiful decline.
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby is particularly sharp on the leading liberal political
theorists -- thinkers like Richard Rorty and Charles Taylor --
whose avowed relativism, he believes, leads to their inability to
say anything robust at all. Because they cannot uphold what was
once thought of as absolute truth or universal reason, they have no
zeal for the utopianism that once animated liberals across the
globe. They represent, Jacoby charges, a kind of ennui of the
liberal political soul, a lassitude that can only allow the likes
of Morris to prevail. And such intellectuals, to Jacoby's horror,
even acknowledge their complicity. Rorty himself has argued that
``it is not something we can remedy by a firmer resolve, or more
transparent prose, or better philosophical accounts of man, truth
or history. It is just the way things happen to have fallen out.''
</P>
<P>
   THE problem, of course, is that the liberal predicament Rorty
points out is a real one. There is a good reason why at the end of
the 20th century utopias, especially leftist utopias, are hard to
believe in, and why both political and philosophical skepticism has
followed the political horrors of the last century. And by far the
weakest part of Jacoby's analysis is his attempt to deny this. He
believes ethnic hatreds and territorial disputes have taken far
more lives in this century than utopianism gone awry. But what has
surely marked the 20th century -- from Stalin to Milosevic -- is
not ancient hatred but the toxic fusion of such hatred with modern
dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby refuses to see this because he needs an unsullied
utopianism. He needs it because without it, he believes, liberalism
cannot thrive: ``A left constituted the liberal backbone; as the
left vaporized, the backbone went soft.'' There is unfortunately no
proof of this postulate in the book. The collapse of the left and
the decline of liberalism have indeed been coincidental, but Jacoby
provides no causative link between the two. One might equally well
argue that it was the left's triumph in the late 1960's that did in
liberalism, and that the left's demise in the 1990's, far from
being a cause of liberalism's extinction, is an opportunity for its
revival. This is why Jacoby's book works far better as a lament
than as an argument. He has diagnosed the problem and made some
worthwhile enemies in doing so. But he is less effective at
providing a solution than even Morris is. At least Morris intuits
the collapse of liberal conviction and exploits it. Jacoby merely
misses Arnold and Mill.
</P>
<P>
   But is Jacoby right that a liberalism without utopia is
unimaginable? Surely not. Is it not truer, in the spirit of Isaiah
Berlin, that it is the abandonment of utopia that makes liberalism
possible? This liberalism is not the same as Morris's bankrupt
acquiescence in the status quo, and it is more realistic than
Jacoby's romanticism. It is a liberalism concerned with pluralism,
fairness and freedom, and it is not hard to see what it would
amount to today. For all the talk of the end of ideology, there are
still plenty of causes. There is genocide again in Europe; there is
economic inequality at home; civil rights are not assured for all
Americans; civil liberties have had a terrible decade; the racial
question remains and festers. For liberals, there may be polls to
be taken, and utopias to be left behind, but there is also work to
be done. It is perhaps the clearest legacy of the current President
that he has done so little of it.

 &UR; BLAME IT ON CHILE
</P>
<P>
   BY SHASHI THAROOR
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Ariel Dorfman -- Chilean expatriate and American
writer, refugee from Pinochet's death squads and professor at Duke
University -- has written movingly and often brilliantly of the
cultural dislocations and political fractures of his dual heritage.
Poet, playwright (``Death and the Maiden'') and essayist, Dorfman
has, in an impressive body of work, done justice to the two
languages that have battled for his voice and the two countries
that claim his allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   He has written of torture and suffering, of cultural imperialism
(``How to Read Donald Duck,'' with Armand Mattelart) and freedom of
the press, of exile and rediscovery (most memorably in his recent
autobiography, ``Heading South, Looking North'').
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Nanny and the Iceberg,'' his sixth novel, Dorfman
reflects some of these concerns in the story of a callow
23-year-old Chilean exile in New York, Gabriel McKenzie, returning
to a homeland recovering from dictatorship, a land obsessed with
sex, politics and cultural identity.
</P>
<P>
   The novel, except for a coda, takes the form of a long suicide
note, e-mailed in installments by Gabriel to an American
girlfriend, Janice. When Gabriel and his radical mother, Milagros,
fled to America in the wake of the Pinochet coup, his father,
Cristobal McKenzie, an expert at tracking down runaway boys, stayed
behind. Cristobal is a larger-than-life Latin lover; he makes a bet
with his best friend, Pablo Baron, that he will have intercourse
with a woman every day of his life until his 50th birthday.
Cristobal, in his wife's words, ``swore to live only for that
moment when you copulate''; his axiom is that he exists because he
fornicates.
</P>
<P>
   Cristobal manages to maintain his daily dose of sex, finding
partners at wakes and even among the nurses in the maternity ward
where his wife delivers Gabriel. But Cristobal's prodigious
carnality is the cause of his son's impotence: his father was there
ahead of him every time he tried, Gabriel writes, ``as if his organ
were in her before mine could even begin to rise up.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel grows up in America under the looming shadow of his
mother's idol, Che Guevara -- the revolutionary, now reduced to a
poster above his bed, whose death brought his parents together --
waiting for the restoration of democracy in Chile so that he can
seek amatory advice from his father. Soon after his return he too
makes a vow, ``that I would only make love to a woman who had not
tasted the fruits of my father's tongue.'' This leads him to pursue
the beautiful teen-age daughter of Pablo Baron, Amanda Camila, the
only female he is sure hasn't fallen to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Pablo, now a minister in Chile's post-Pinochet democratic
Government, wants to tow an Antarctic iceberg, 70 tons of it and 30
feet high, to the Expo '92 world's fair in Seville, Spain,
commemorating the 500th anniversary of Columbus's voyage to
America. The idea is to market a new image of Chile: not a tropical
third world country full of dark-skinned indigenes, but ``the New
Zealand of Latin America.'' However, Pablo has received a note from
the mysterious ``Comandante You-Know-Who'' threatening the iceberg,
and he persuades the McKenzies, father and son, to take the case on
and save the project.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel realizes he came to Chile searching for ``even the shoal
of a father to wreck myself on.'' His mother wanted to save the
country, his father wanted to save runaways, ``and neither of them
seemed interested in saving me.'' Fortified by the wisdom and the
cooking of his mother's 80-year-old nanny, a native descended from
an extinct Patagonian tribe, Gabriel comes into his own and
Cristobal finally gives Gabriel the parental advice he has been
waiting for. Before the novel's end Gabriel himself is sounding
worldly-wise: ``Women want two things from men: they want a father
to protect them and they want a son to protect.''
</P>
<P>
   Some readers may find the incessant priapism tiresome, but ``The
Nanny and the Iceberg'' sustains interest by keeping you guessing:
Who is threatening the iceberg and why? Who will win the notorious
wager? Who is really whose father? And will Gabriel finally fulfill
his threat to blow himself and the iceberg up in Seville? The novel
is overladen, though, with direct, and sometimes crude, discussions
of physical intimacy, whose effect is not always engaging. When
Pablo's daughter Amanda is born, Cristobal presents him with a
condom -- the one he'll never use, a token of his commitment not to
sleep with his friend's daughter. Pablo carries it around in his
wallet as a good-luck charm. This episode encapsulates the novel's
singular attitude toward sex and friendship. Pablo tells Gabriel:
``Friendship is more important than sex. Sex passes -- a few
thrusts in, a few thrusts out, a spasm of pleasure and then it's
over. But friendship. That lasts, and that's what we live for.
Lasts longer than anything we have with women, with their big
breasts and their small brains.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a Latin American novel written in English, and its
sensibility is a cross between the macho masculinism of the barrio
and the street smarts of New York. The author never quite manages a
settled narrative voice for his young protagonist, who veers
between lyricism in the finest Latin American tradition and its
opposite. Passages of confidence and grace, like a section
describing a search in Antarctica for the vital iceberg, alternate
with similes of adolescent shallowness (``She flirted as if she had
learned the technique at Vamp University''). Poetic prose is too
often undermined by jarringly crude language. If Joseph Conrad is
right in demanding that a work of art should carry its
justification in every line, then ``The Nanny and the Iceberg''
does not quite measure up to the standards we are entitled to
expect from Dorfman.
</P>
<P>
   Cristobal tells his son about the first time he made love to
Milagros: ``I began to understand, and understood it even better
when I finally got inside her and I lost and found myself there,
that this was what life was about, its meaning for me, the only
meaning that really fit into this only life that had been given to
me.'' My only problem with ``The Nanny and the Iceberg'' is that it
does not offer any greater meaning than that, and we know that the
intelligent, subtle and gifted Ariel Dorfman could have given us
one.

 &UR; ON THE BEACH
</P>
<P>
   BY DAVID RAINS WALLACE
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Americans love the seashore. A growing majority of us (including
this writer) live within an hour's drive of it. What is the source
of this allure? Natural beauty and fresh seafood play a part, of
course, but the main attraction probably is the beach. The
pleasures of congregating in seminudity on hot sand are somehow
vital to modern civilization. Cornelia Dean's ``Against the Tide''
warns, however, that Americans may not have beaches much longer or,
at least, the public beaches that defined so much of 20th-century
culture may fade as upkeep becomes more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   America's seashores are in trouble. Hundreds of miles are
urbanized, wildlife is dwindling or contaminated and the
destruction has accelerated since the trouble became obvious in the
1960's. Yet the environmental journalist who opens this Pandora's
box faces a daunting task trying to describe it. Where to begin?
Water pollution? Fisheries destruction? Wetlands loss? Dean, the
science editor of The New York Times, addresses the problem
adroitly by concentrating on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Beaches are so important as social milieus that they may not
seem natural, but they are. Dean does an excellent job of
explaining how they evolve and function. Beaches are among the most
dynamic geological phenomena, their workings so massive and subtle
that scientists have yet to understand them. We know that they form
as coastal currents transport sand flushed from river mouths and
deposit it along the shore. The currents, and factors like tides
and storms, remove sand from shores as fast as they deposit it, so
beaches must be continually replenished by more sand eroded from
the land.
</P>
<P>
   On the Pacific coast, where colliding tectonic plates push the
land upward, most beaches form in bays between steep headlands. On
the geologically more quiescent Atlantic and gulf coasts, most form
at the seaward edge of long barrier islands. In all cases, they
function as buffers between land and sea, protecting terrestrial
habitats from flooding. Storms can destroy them overnight, but
newly deposited sand quickly rebuilds them under natural
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Wide beaches prevailed on North America's coasts when Europeans
arrived. Dean's descriptions of them -- they lasted into the late
19th century -- are like something from another world. Long
Island's were ``spectacular expanses of fine-grained, light gray
sand, hundreds of yards wide, backed by grass-covered dunes as much
as 15 or 20 feet high.'' Many stretched for scores of miles, and
often were the main travel routes for settlers. Beaches began to
dwindle, however, as urban Americans discovered the shore. The
reason is simple and ironic. Beaches depend for existence on
wide-open natural processes, but people cannot live in large
numbers on the shore without interfering with those processes.
</P>
<P>
   Coastal processes include violent events such as storms, and
burgeoning coastal communities quickly encountered terrifying
situations. Dean makes the terror graphically clear in her first
chapter, on the destruction of Galveston in 1900. The thousands who
died in a September hurricane were strewn across the Texas coast so
gruesomely that military authorities had to force laborers at
gunpoint to collect them. Communities responded by ``armoring'' the
shore, protecting houses and streets with sea walls, jetties,
groins and other structures. But that armoring interrupted the flow
of beach-nourishing waters -- not only coastal currents that bring
sand to beaches but tides and waves that rebuild them. Starved of
sand, beaches melted away. Where hundreds of feet of dry sand once
separated communities from the surf, high-tide lines crept to the
bases of sea walls, and strollers now must clamber over obstacle
courses of concrete and steel.
</P>
<P>
   Americans responded with more technology, replacing lost sand
artificially. Dean shows that many beaches where sunbathers
congregate today are man-made, their sands pumped from elsewhere.
Artificial beaches are vulnerable to the same erosion that destroys
natural ones, so we are faced with a costly cycle of repeatedly
replacing beaches. Storms can snatch away not only a new beach but
the machinery that made it. The situation is heart-rending for
hundreds of coastal communities, and Dean tries to be evenhanded
about its complexities. Indeed, she cites so many specific cases
that her narrative occasionally slows under the weight of detail.
The upshot seems clear: America can't expect to preserve its
beaches if it keeps destroying them with coastal construction --
especially at a time when a projected sea-level rise from global
warming compounds the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The only lasting solution to loss of beaches will be a halt to
(or even a reversal of) urban growth along them. Dean points to
some hopeful trends. Communities and conservation groups are buying
beaches to stop owners building on them. Ten national seashores
protect several hundred miles of beach. (Only one is on the West
Coast, unfortunately.) Government is less willing to subsidize
beach development or bail out property owners. Insuring beach
structures is getting harder.
</P>
<P>
   Yet conservation lags far behind growth, and the prospect of an
urban withdrawal from the beach seems distant. As Dean points out,
the consequences of wholesale coastal urbanization could be
ghastly. If a ``worst case'' Category 5 hurricane hit southern
Florida, for example, the havoc wreaked by Hurricane Andrew in 1992
would be small by comparison, since that weaker, Category 4 storm
missed downtown Miami. ``Hurricane Andrew should be remembered as a
narrow escape, a warning about what can happen when people
overdevelop the coast,'' Dean writes. Hurricanes constitute only
one threat. Dean overlooks a Western one -- tidal waves or tsunamis
from earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   Impending disasters point up a limitation of Dean's strategy of
building her case against coastal urbanization around beaches.
Controlling urbanization on beaches would save beaches, money and
lives. It would not prevent huge destruction in a big hurricane or
tsunami, since such events can reach well inland. Saving beaches
will not save the coasts if urban proliferation continues unchecked
nearby. Beach conservation could be a keystone for building a
coastwide conservation system, but not the whole edifice.
</P>
<P>
   Such limitations probably are unavoidable, however, at a time
when environmental problems have receded from the public's
attention. Dean has done a first-rate job of making coastal
conservation interesting. ``Against the Tide'' would be good beach
reading.

 &UR; OH MOM, POOR MOM
</P>
<P>
   BY NANCY WILLARD
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Jean Piaget observed that scarcely any question seems absurd to
a child, but he was silent on the question of absurd answers from
adults. In Jenny Offill's remarkable first novel, ``Last Things,''
7-year-old Grace Davitt watches her mother, Anna, descend into
madness and tries to make sense of the claustrophobic world that
Anna has created for her. The child has been plucked out of school
for behavior problems and is being educated at home, in a small
town in Vermont on Lake Champlain. Her father, Jonathan, is a
chemistry teacher; her mother is an ornithologist who decides to
teach Grace the history of the world in a room she has painted
black and decorated with glow-in-the-dark stars: ``In one corner
was a desk and a small blackboard. On the wall behind them, my
mother had painted some words in white. 'It's the cosmic calendar,'
she said. 'Everything that's happened since the beginning of time
compressed into just one year.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Grace's unsentimental education is anything but rational, and
this is no ordinary coming-of-age novel. Her mother's downward
spiral takes center stage. Demonstrating a lively knowledge of both
science and magic, Offill shows Anna stuffing her daughter with
answers that veer from the scientific to the fantastic. Yet the
child accepts every absurdity because it comes from a higher
authority:
</P>
<P>
   '' 'Once,' my mother said, 'there was no true darkness. Even at
night, the moon was as bright as the sun. The only difference was
that the light was blue. You could see clearly for miles and miles
and it was never cold. And this was called twilight.' 'Why twi?' I
asked. 'Because it rhymes with sky,' my mother said. 'It's a code
word for blue.' Code blue was what they said when someone died, I
remembered, and this, too, had to do with the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Important cosmic events, dated and noted like entries from the
earth's diary, are interspersed throughout the narrative. But
applying the rigorous methodology of science to the imagination is
like putting a dream on dialysis, and the cosmic calendar, with its
succession of vanishing species, casts a terrible shadow over
Anna's faith in her own survival. ``My mother said that stones were
last things and would be around long after people were gone. Other
last things were oceans, metal and crows.'' The child translates
her mother's pronouncements into practical magic: ``I thought that
if I filled a birdbath with seawater and dropped a coin in it, I
might glimpse the end of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace ponders the mysteries revealed in the Encyclopedia of the
Unexplained (a gift from her mother) and sees herself as a
detective, keeping lists of words and facts in her notebook. ``I
had an idea that someday someone would come to me with a mystery
and I would open up the notebook and all the clues would already be
there.'' Ordinary communications are fringed with codes, signs,
questions and disguises. Grace's eccentric baby sitter, a
16-year-old genius named Edgar, suggests that ``everyone around you
might be an ingenious robot and you're the only one that's not.''
Uncle Pete, her father's twin brother, plays Mr. Science on a
television show for children. When he runs off with one of the
show's writers, Grace's father easily steps into the role, playing
his brother playing Mr. Science. Anna is fluent in Annic, her own
secret language, invented by her father.
</P>
<P>
   Appearances are not only deceiving, they are baffling. Who can
one trust in such a world except a cryptozoologist?
``Cryptozoologists were detectives who specialized in finding
hidden animals. . . . This was the sort of detective my mother
wanted me to be.'' For ``hidden,'' read ``endangered,''
``legendary,'' ``vanished,'' ``extinct.'' Make no mistake.
Hide-and-seek is not child's play. Offill gives us journeys within
journeys: the earth keeping time, the light sent eons ago from a
dead star, Anna's harrowing cross-country drive with Grace, which
ends in a California desert.
</P>
<P>
   Offill does not succumb to the familiar tug-of-war between
science and religion; her characters, not their ideas, are her
major concern. The child's nonjudgmental point of view and deadpan
accounts of people caught in the thrall of their convictions make
``Last Things'' an unexpectedly funny book. Grace's father wants to
protect her from religion. Her mother wants to do no harm to the
natural world. When Anna receives a collapsible iron from her
husband for Christmas, her query reminds us that to one who voyages
in the imagination pressed clothes are as useless as traveler's
checks:
</P>
<P>
   ``My father didn't believe in Christmas, but still we celebrated
it. It was like not believing in God but still you prayed. My
mother said it was a shame to cut down a tree, so instead we chose
one in the forest and tied a ribbon around it so we could find it
again. . . . We opened our presents all at once because it was too
cold to take turns. . . . My mother folded and unfolded the iron;
then she ran it across the snow. 'How marvelous,' she said. 'What
do you suppose its purpose is?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The novel is crisply written, economically constructed and so
inventive that you read without a clue as to what anyone will say
or do next. Offill's fresh voice, endearing and quirky, makes you
willingly suspend disbelief. Underlying the surprises is a
carefully constructed pattern of motifs -- water, animals,
darkness, unsolved mysteries -- that cluster into metaphors for
what happens to Grace's mother, which is not described directly.
The reader understands it as Grace does, through various clues.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few chapters, Grace takes her first steps toward a
life of her own, though scarred by her mother's emotional
detachment. The final chapter, filled with lyrical speculation
about Anna, has the power of a dream carried not in the head but in
the heart.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Publishers Weekly, Offill talked about the
origins of the novel: ``It occurred to me that a child would be a
very good companion for a madwoman.'' This idea is also central to
Marilynne Robinson's ``Housekeeping,'' although Robinson's novel,
narrated by an adult looking back at childhood, is faithful to
memory in what it includes: landscape, characters, personal
reflections. In contrast, Offill's is faithful to the child's point
of view in what it leaves out -- a circumscribed telling indeed.
But if ``last things'' means things that will last, then Offill's
novel is one of them.

 NEW &AMP; NOTEWORTHY PAPERBACKS
 BY SCOTT VEALE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRAIN STORM
</P>
<P>
   By Richard Dooling. Picador USA, $14.
</P>
<P>
   The hero of this clever, densely packed thriller is a St. Louis
lawyer who is assigned to defend a despicable criminal and becomes
involved with a brain researcher with an explanation for
everything. ``Here is a whodunit that achieves a comic fugue-state
mastery of the language of our sexually charged, violent,
technocratic society,'' Colin Harrison wrote here last year.
</P>
<P>
   TO END A WAR
</P>
<P>
   By Richard Holbrooke. Modern Library, $15.95.
</P>
<P>
   The American diplomat in charge of the 1995 Dayton peace
accords, which resulted in a halt in the fighting in Bosnia, tells
his story through anecdotes, withering strategic analysis and sharp
portraits of the wily Balkan leaders and timid NATO military
commanders involved in the talks. His ``engaging, witty and
dramatic account,'' which was selected by the editors of the Book
Review as one of the best books of 1998, is also ``an impassioned
plea for Washington to use the military might at its disposal to
intervene when societies break down,'' Chris Hedges wrote here last
year. In Blood and Vengeance: One Family's Story of the War in
Bosnia, by Chuck Sudetic (Penguin, $14.95), a Croatian-American
journalist who covered the war for The New York Times follows
several generations of a Muslim family near Srebrenica, where
Bosnian Serbs massacred several thousand Muslims in 1995. Last year
our reviewer, Tom Gjelten, called this ``a narrative so rich and
strong it not only describes the crime but dares to explain it and
does so with eloquence and dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY
</P>
<P>
   By Helen Fielding. Penguin, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   This comic novel follows a 30-something Brit who vows to lose
weight, control her drinking and basically get a grip on herself as
she struggles with demeaning dates and disastrous dinner parties.
``The book is a compilation of memorably silly moments in the life
of a hapless Everywoman,'' Elizabeth Gleick said here in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   THE HACIENDA: A MEMOIR
</P>
<P>
   By Lisa St. Aubin de Tern. Back Bay/Little, Brown, $13.
</P>
<P>
   The British author was 17 years old when she married an unstable
Venezuelan aristocrat and moved to his Andean estate. Out of her
nightmarish marriage came a 1982 novel, ``Keepers of the House,''
and this lyrical nonfiction account, which is also an affectionate
portrait of a lost world and its people. The result is ``a
transfixing performance,'' Michael Upchurch wrote here last year.
</P>
<P>
   PEYTON PLACE
</P>
<P>
   By Grace Metalious. Northeastern University, $13.95.
</P>
<P>
   It may not seem as naughty today, but this lurid novel about a
New Hampshire town, with its deflowerings, suicides and other dark
goings-on, ruffled a lot of feathers when it was first published in
1956. ``Sinclair Lewis would no doubt have hailed Metalious as a
sister-in-arms against the . . . bourgeois pretensions of allegedly
respectable communities,'' Carlos Baker wrote here.
</P>
<P>
   TECUMSEH: A LIFE
</P>
<P>
   By John Sugden. John Macrae/Owl/Holt, $15.95.
</P>
<P>
   The great Indian leader was a proud, charismatic warrior who
envisioned a pan-Indian alliance and helped defeat an American
invasion of Canada during the War of 1812. Last year our reviewer,
Barry Gewen, called this ``a richly detailed, utterly scrupulous
account that is as poignant as it is informative -- for Tecumseh
seems to have been doomed from the start.''
</P>
<P>
   THE IBIS TAPESTRY
</P>
<P>
   By Mike Nicol. Vintage International, $13.
</P>
<P>
   This novel's narrator is a South African writer who receives a
dead man's laptop computer and gets pulled into an underground
world of gunrunning. '' 'The Ibis Tapestry' plays skillfully with
truth and fiction to portray the landscape of a nation undergoing
revolutionary change,'' Erik Burns wrote here last year. Home
Ground, by Lynn Freed (Story Line, $14), focuses on a theater
family whose internal dramas provide a metaphor for apartheid-era
politics. ``What is extraordinary about this book is its
perspective,'' Janette Turner Hospital wrote here in 1986.
``Freed's guileless child-narrator takes us inside the neurosis''
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   THE LAST VOYAGE OF THE KARLUK:
</P>
<P>
   A Survivor's Memoir of Arctic Disaster
</P>
<P>
   By William Laird McKinlay. St. Martin's Griffin, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   The author was a meteorologist with a 1913 expedition to chart
the Arctic region that resulted in disaster: the ship sank early
on, and the few survivors were stranded on a barren island for six
months. In 1977 our reviewer, Alix Nelson, called this a tale
``written with a grace, modesty and power that are the measure of
the man.'' Ship of Gold in the Deep Blue Sea, by Gary Kinder
(Vintage, $14), chronicles the sinking of a gold-laden paddle
steamer in a hurricane off the Carolina coast in 1857 and the
effort in the 1980's to recover its treasure. ``The author writes
beautifully -- historical and technological reporting of a high
order, as suspenseful and deft about the doomed steamer as the
salvage vessels,'' John Maxtone-Graham wrote here last year.
</P>
<P>
   A WORLD AWAY
</P>
<P>
   By Stewart O'Nan. Owl/Holt, $13.
</P>
<P>
   On Long Island circa 1943, a troubled family plays out its
summer of discontent, complete with adultery and an unraveling
marriage. Last year our reviewer, Timothy Foote, admired the
novel's ``intricately overlapping streams of consciousness that
rove back and forth, creating past and present with fleeting hints
about the characters' lives.''

 &UR; SIREN SONG
</P>
<P>
   BY MIRANDA SEYMOUR
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The jacket of this buoyant and accomplished first novel features
a photograph, very faintly tinted, of two pretty girls,
nonchalantly curvaceous, bare except for their striped stockings.
Their round backsides sway in just enough to meet on the narrow bar
of a circus trapeze. The models wear the beguiling, dimpled smiles
of professional sirens, and the angle of the camera puts us in a
crowd of grubby spectators, faces turned up, waiting for the swing
to move.
</P>
<P>
   It's a mildly troubling picture, one that immediately arouses
curiosity. You want to know more about the occasion; you scold
yourself for being titillated; you find yourself noticing that the
photographer has distanced the girls from the audience: the charms
they so frankly display are out of reach and will remain so. All in
all, it's a clever preparation for the yearning opening pages of
``Tipping the Velvet,'' an erotic and absorbing story set in
late-Victorian England.
</P>
<P>
   The novel's heroine, Nancy King, is an oyster-seller's daughter,
a simple, dreamy girl as soaked in brine as any mermaid. Going with
her sister to the local music hall, the Canterbury Palace, Nancy
sees her first ``masher'' on stage -- Miss Kitty Butler, swaggering
out as a pretty boy in evening clothes to sing and throw a rose
into the audience, a gift for her chosen favorite. Nancy, reaching
for the prize, is instantly, utterly smitten. Oblivious of the
teasing of her family, she returns again and again in her best
Sunday clothes, sitting in the plush seat she can't afford,
yearning for a glance or a nod from Miss Butler.
</P>
<P>
   Waters has captured it beautifully -- not only the seediness of
the hall and the transforming spell cast by the jaunty
cross-dressing girl but the star-struck innocence of Nancy's first
love, the breathless passion she can hardly find words to describe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like I never saw anything at all before,'' she tells her
astonished sister. ``It's like I am filling up, like a wine-glass
when it's filled with wine. I watch the acts before her and they
are like nothing -- they're like dust. Then she walks on the stage
and -- she is so pretty; and her suit is so nice; and her voice is
so sweet. . . . She makes me want to smile and weep, at once. . . .
I never saw a girl like her before. I never knew that there were
girls like her.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the voice that holds our attention throughout the book,
making even the preposterous acceptable, because it remains so
intimate, so ordinary, so convincing. If lesbian fiction is to
reach a wider readership -- as much, though far from all, of it
deserves to do -- Waters is just the person to carry the banner.
Less ostentatious and self-referential than Jeanette Winterson, to
whom some British critics have been comparing her, she has more
flair for narrative and a stronger grasp of her characters.
</P>
<P>
   Formally, ``Tipping the Velvet'' resembles the picaresque novels
of the 18th century, rambling forward through loosely connected
episodes that exist only to offer startlingly contrasted
experiences to a wide-eyed protagonist. Nancy, to her wild
excitement, is invited to leave her jolly family and go up to
London as Kitty Butler's dresser. From slavish adorer, she
progresses to sharing Kitty's act, to receiving the kind of bashful
adulation she once offered. The girls in the novel become the
smiling, unattainable sirens of that photograph.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Nancy soon becomes painfully aware, her love will always
be hidden away. ``Toms,'' as Kitty teaches her to call openly
lesbian girls, are to be avoided. Kitty is ready to respond to
Nancy's love, but not to risk her reputation. Nothing, she insists,
must ever be revealed.
</P>
<P>
   With a shrewd eye on the future, Kitty eventually marries her
manager, Walter Bliss, and Nancy, half demented with grief and
jealousy, decides to bury her identity, to become the character
whose clothes she has so successfully adopted. A girlishly
appealing soldier boy, she hawks herself in the notorious streets
east of Piccadilly, available to anyone who wants to buy five
minutes of pleasure in a dark alley. This is the grimy, vicious
world uncovered by Henry Mayhew in his painstaking research into
the London slums, and Waters brings it all too horribly to life.
</P>
<P>
   Loosely speaking, ``Tipping the Velvet'' falls into five parts.
We've seen first love, the stage and the streets. In the third and
most candidly sexual section, Nancy is picked up by a rich and
vicious widow with a handsome home and an interesting line in
leather accessories.
</P>
<P>
   Again, it is the confidence and elegance of Waters's writing
that saves the novel from descending into a pornographic romp; in
fact, the widow's home and her bizarre life style contribute to one
of the most engrossing and convincing sections of the book. The
scene in which Nancy dresses up as the Roman page Antinous for the
delectation of the widow's lascivious friends, and the brutal
episode that follows, in which she is hurled back into the streets,
are written with startling power.
</P>
<P>
   My only regret is that Waters felt the need to press her
political message quite so strenuously in the final chapters of the
novel, with Nancy finding the love of a good woman and becoming a
pillar of the labor movement. The story here is still well told,
the characters clearly defined; what mars it is the sense of a
tacked-on moral, as though Waters had suddenly lost her nerve about
the boldness of her own imaginings.

 &UR; RUNNING HOT AND COLD
</P>
<P>
   BY FERNANDA EBERSTADT
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   One of the more energetic and magisterial of contemporary
British writers, A. S. Byatt is part of a generation of
novelists-cum-academics from the provinces -- the 20th-century
heiresses to George Eliot -- whose strong intellects won them
entrance to the great universities and for whom, consequently,
academia betokened not crabbed shelter but the freedom of noble
company. It's no coincidence that a collection of her criticism is
entitled ``Passions of the Mind.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Ruskinian tradition, Byatt's particular mental passion
inhabits that place where esthetics and moralism fuse. Her
fictional protagonists are frequently painters or art historians or
artisans. Like the Victorian writers she recalls, Byatt has a bent
for fairy tales -- fertile ground for lovers of both artifice and
ethics, for storytellers who happen to be interested in what one of
her characters calls the ``ambages and sinuosities'' of their
craft.
</P>
<P>
   There is an episode in an earlier volume of short stories, ``The
Djinn in the Nightingale's Eye,'' that reveals the highly conscious
duality of Byatt's fiction. In the title story, a middle-aged
``narratologist'' uncorks a genie from an antique-shop phial. When
the genie, a giant of intoxicating male sexuality, demands a
secret, the narratologist tells of her discovery that a glamorous
friend of her youth grew up in a suburban home stuffed with knitted
tea cozies and featuring a ``three-piece suite in moquette.'' The
genie, who has regaled her with memories of Suleiman the
Magnificent and the Queen of Sheba, is puzzled by the triteness of
her revelation. ``All English stories,'' she explains wearily,
``get bogged down in whether or not the furniture is socially and
esthetically acceptable. This wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The disjunction between the priapic genie and the ``three-piece
suite in moquette,'' between art's wide enchantment and a snobbish
parochialism, is central to Byatt's writing. ``Elementals,'' her
latest collection of short fiction, combines what a story called
``Crocodile Tears'' describes as the ``world of mythical
absolutes'' with an inhibiting concern for the esthetically
acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the acid precision with which ``A Lamia in the
Cevennes'' begins: ``In the mid-1980's Bernard Lycett-Kean decided
that Thatcher's Britain was uninhabitable, a land of dog-eat-dog,
lung-corroding ozone and floating money, of which there was at once
far too much and far too little. He sold his West Hampstead flat
and bought a small stone house on a Cevenol hillside.'' Like many
British expatriates fleeing to the Mediterranean countryside,
Byatt's artist hero becomes obsessed with his swimming pool: 1.
How, after Hockney, to capture its seraphic blue? and (more
crucially) 2. How to deal with its clogged purification system?
Unlike most expatriates, he discovers that the pool is haunted by a
serpent-woman, or Lamia, who explains that she can be freed from
her snake body only if she marries a mortal. Bernard finds the
Lamia's female portions even more repulsive than her ``coils,'' but
manages to fob her off on an unwanted houseguest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crocodile Tears'' also involves a Londoner's escape to the
south of France. Patricia Nimmo's husband, Tony, drops dead on the
floor of a Bloomsbury art gallery after a tiff with his wife over
whether or not a small English seascape is ``banal.'' Patricia, a
middle-aged businesswoman with an unrealized appetite for mystery,
steps over his corpse and onto a train to Nmes. There she meets a
fellow northerner, a Norwegian schoolmaster who seeks to cure her
of her guilt-induced ``indifference'' by introducing her to the
ancient city's honeyed cult of ``blood and death and ritual.'' (The
incomplete nature of Patricia's emancipation is suggested when,
visiting the grave that her children have raised for their father,
she pronounces, ``This is vulgar.'')
</P>
<P>
   Many of the stories in ``Elementals'' -- confirming its
subtitle, ``Stories of Fire and Ice'' -- do indeed involve
northerners who are either imprisoned or revived by the brutal
south. The loveliest is an unalloyed fairy tale entitled simply
``Cold,'' which tells of an ice princess wedded to a desert prince
who constructs an elaborate cave palace of spun glass to keep her
alive.
</P>
<P>
   The besetting sin of Byatt's ``inexpressive northerners'' is an
unwillingness to be moved. Patricia in ``Crocodile Tears,''
visiting Nmes during the bullfighting season, refuses to look at
the matadors' ``absurd deathly dance''; the narrator of ``Jael''
examines the biblical story from the book of Judges, a feast day of
intricacies and reversals of expectation, and remembers only its
``shocking morals.'' Opposing these blinkered prigs are Byatt's
artist guides, counseling curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   The repeated message of ``Elementals'' is stated clearly in a
short fable, reminiscent of Isak Dinesen, entitled ``Christ in the
House of Martha and Mary,'' in which Velzquez, staying at a grand
Spanish house, teaches a gifted but bad-tempered cook not to resent
her languidly indifferent masters. ``The divide,'' he informs her,
``is not between the servants and the served, between the leisured
and the workers, but between those who are interested in the world
and its multiplicity of forms and forces, and those who merely
subsist, worrying or yawning. . . . The world is full of light and
life, and the true crime is not to be interested in it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Elementals'' is similarly full of light and life, the
throwaway gleams of a writer at the height of her powers. Byatt's
prose is capacious yet exquisite, and it is proof of her ample
gifts that she can rivet us in a story like ``Crocodile Tears''
with what, from a less unified talent, might feel like a
travelogue, a restaurant review or art criticism. But Byatt is also
an angry writer, drawn to explore the violence that bursts out of
modestly circumscribed lives. In ``Elementals,'' it is the rage of
her unappeasable northerners, these latter-day ``berserkers'' on
southern holiday, that lingers long after the exhortation to be
``interested'' in life.

 &UR; THE EPONYMOUS SADIST
</P>
<P>
   BY MIM UDOVITCH
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Reviled in his own lifetime and resurrected in the latter half
of this century, the Marquis de Sade, Richard Seaver writes in his
introduction to Sade's ``Letters From Prison,'' today ``enjoys a
measure of respect far greater than he ever could have imagined in
his wildest dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the nature and content of the wildest dreams of Sade's
imagination and their various methods of measuring respect, this is
really saying something. Not that Seaver doesn't have a point _ the
much-written-about Marquis has slowly but surely become something
like the Madonna of arts and letters: a reliably controversial and
safely daring subject that speaks to a paradoxical, voyeuristic
desire to see what you don't want to see.
</P>
<P>
   Still, following hot on the heels of Francine du Plessix Gray's
``At Home With the Marquis de Sade'' and Laurence L. Bongie's
``Sade: A Biographical Essay,'' Neil Schaeffer's biography, ``The
Marquis de Sade: A Life,'' enters such an unusually crowded field
that in some respects it is already out of date. (For example, what
Schaeffer deems the only extant piece of correspondence written by
Sade's mother is supplemented in ``Sade: A Biographical Essay'' by
several letters newly discovered by Bongie.)
</P>
<P>
   However, especially given that most readers will not be sitting
down with all three books, Sade's life is, to put it mildly,
sufficiently interesting to sustain several retellings and numerous
approaches. He is, at the very least, surely the only man in
history to have imprisoned a prostitute and forced her to listen to
him prove the nonexistence of God all night, after which, and who
is to blame her, she went straight to the police.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the recent biographies neatly cover the spectrum of
negative to the point of prosecutorial (Bongie); to tolerantly,
moderately sympathetic (du Plessix Gray); to practically poleaxed
by devotion (Schaeffer).
</P>
<P>
   The bare, undisputed outlines of the life of
Donatien-Alphonse-Franois de Sade are as follows: He was the only
surviving child, born in 1740, of Jean-Baptiste de Sade and his
wife, who was born Marie-eleonore de Maille. He was descended on
his father's side from an ancient and noble Provenal family, who
claimed among its ancestors Laure de Noves, a plausible candidate
for Petrarch's mysterious muse, Laura. Through his mother, a
distant cousin of the Prince de Conde, he was collaterally related
to the Bourbon kings, a point of pride in the Sade family to this
day. (``How could you not want to know about the Marquis de Sade?''
the current Comte de Sade, who, unlike some of his more immediate
forebears, owns the connection freely, asks du Plessix Gray. ``He's
descended from King St. Louis!'')
</P>
<P>
   Sade's father, an improvident roue, was briefly a minor
diplomat; his mother was a lady-in-waiting to her cousin through
marriage, the Princesse de Conde. After spending his first four
years with Marie-eleonore at the Conde palace, the young Donatien
was raised by his father's family in Provence, primarily by his
uncle, the rakish Abbe de Sade.
</P>
<P>
   After four years in Paris at the Jesuit college Louis-le-Grand,
Sade entered an elite military academy at 14, and eventually an
elite cavalry regiment, from which he was demobilized in 1763, at
the end of the Seven Years' War. The same year, he was hustled by
his cash-poor father into a marriage with the well-connected,
well-off but relatively not well-born or well-favored Renee-Pelagie
de Montreuil.
</P>
<P>
   After an escalating series of sex-related offenses, in 1777 Sade
was imprisoned by royal fiat more or less at the behest of his
mother-in-law, who was enraged by his seduction of her younger
daughter, Anne-Prospre. Freed by the Revolution in 1789 and
separated from a finally fed-up Renee-Pelagie, he lived without
major mishap until his authorship of the scandalous ``Justine'' in
1791 led to his commitment 10 years later to a mental hospital,
where he died in 1814.
</P>
<P>
   His work and his reputation, as reviewed and interpreted by
writers and thinkers such as Simone de Beauvoir, Michel Foucault
and Roland Barthes, to name but a few, have been in a state of
habitual comeback ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Sade is, of course, best known for the set of sexual
predilections associated with those he details in his fiction and
that have come to bear his name. In most of his novels, these
alternate about equally with a philosophy that can be fairly
completely summarized as: There is no God; nature is all;
self-interest and the will to pleasure are natural; and it is
therefore unnatural to resist desire, which is inherently dark and
destructive, so may the worst man win.
</P>
<P>
   His formal writing (his letters are delightful) is blunt and
repetitive, and even most of his loyal adherents don't make much of
a claim for him on strictly literary grounds. Like, say, William
Burroughs, Sade is a writer whose work functions more as a sort of
place card for a body of thought than it does as an entity of
independent value. As an aristocrat who lived through the ancien
regime's last gasp, a physical prisoner whose primary subject was
conceptual freedom, a seductive charmer who favored force and a
male sexual tyrant whose life was ruled by powerful women, Sade by
definition is an argument in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeffer, a professor of English at Brooklyn College, enters
this fray with the sense of urgency peculiar to Sade studies. His
primary focus is on Sade's psychological development.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Sade's conscious fantasies turned to erotic violence,
especially directed against women, we may ask where and why those
underground rivers of rage and sexuality met,'' he writes after
quoting from a letter in which Sade describes a dream vision he had
of his ancestress, Laure de Noves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where was the first abandonment, disappointment, even betrayal
that lurks behind the beautiful, compassionate Laure of the
dream?'' You guessed it, Freudians. Mothers certainly do come in
for brutal treatment in Sade's novels, and motherhood itself is
repeatedly asserted to be meaningless. But since Sade's
relationship with his own mother is barely documented, this avenue
of inquiry is largely speculative; the consensus (disputed by
Bongie) is that she was remote and rejecting. In fact, Sade's
childhood in general is rather minimally documented; explanations
of his temperament as a child, his separation from his mother and
his departure for Provence when he was 4, for example, are based
almost entirely on a presumably autobiographical passage from his
novel ``Aline et Valcour, ou le Roman Philosophique'' describing a
fight with his slightly older cousin, the Prince of Conde, as a
result of which he was banished from the palace.
</P>
<P>
   (One of Bongie's newly found letters from Sade's mother confirms
at least that such a quarrel took place.)
</P>
<P>
   Because of this minimal documentation, the early parts of ``The
Marquis de Sade'' are the weakest. Proceeding from the not
unreasonable assumption that trauma occurred, but without any one
particular thing from which to infer it, Schaeffer tends to cover
all eventualities by depicting everything in Sade's childhood as
traumatic -- the move to Provence, the move from Provence, the
stress of academic expectations, war and marriage are all suggested
as motivators for what is after all only a presumed personality
type, the shy and angry loner who believed that ``if he became an
object of discipline, this meant that he was not alone in an
indifferent world.''
</P>
<P>
   In spots, Schaeffer's attempts to penetrate Sade's psychological
character are more earnest than they are astute. Occasionally they
are silly. ``Our two horses are giving us some trouble: his is off
his feed, and is lame (somewhat); he claims it's out of spite,
since, when he gets a chance to run off, he skips like a goat,'' a
traveling companion writes of the young Sade during his time in the
cavalry, in a letter to the Marquis' father.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeffer posits that this seemingly rather commonplace
rhetorical pleasantry describes ``a small instance of Sade's
characteristic paranoia: Sade somehow came to believe that his
horse was persecuting him with a feigned injury.''
</P>
<P>
   The part of Sade's life that seems the most obviously related to
Sade's literature is the period after his marriage but before his
imprisonment in 1777 _ that is, the period during which the sexual
exploits that got him locked up took place.
</P>
<P>
   Sade's staunchest supporters usually offer a sort of cos fan
tutti defense, and Schaeffer does likewise: sodomy, though illegal,
was common; flagellation was a standard practice among prostitutes,
etc. (This could also be termed the plus ca change argument: women
of loose morals wouldn't scruple to lie; he's rich and they just
want to hold him up for money, etc.) Leaving aside the fact that in
two of the incidents the women in question did not agree with Sade
that they were prostitutes, and given that this was an era in which
the King of France had a private brothel custom stocked with
adolescents because his official mistress, Mme. de Pompadour,
didn't like sex and there was, du Plessix Gray says, a young woman
reputed to be ``the official whipper of the Count of Binheim'';
even given that in an age of formal class distinction definitions
of consent were not what they are now, and granting the virtue of
all principles of sexual libertarianism, this argument is off
point. What made Sade's actions problematic was not the nature of
the sexual action but the fact that he tended to kidnap, imprison,
drug or threaten to kill the other parties. By the time Sade was in
his early 20's, the chief of the Paris vice squad was warning
brothels not to let him take women off the premises.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Schaeffer is probably not wrong when he writes
that Sade's ``sexual life would find a modern equivalent among a
great many film and rock stars. Their public expect and vicariously
enjoy their escapades. There is always an actual or an imagined
privileged sexual class, and individuals who think they belong to
such a class usually can get away with a great deal if they are
careful and lucky. Sade was neither.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the weirder demonstrations of the degree to which
puritanical and pornographic attitudes toward sex coincide, Sade's
sexual life was vicariously enjoyed in his day, by a public who
followed it in the yellow press and by Louis XV and Mme. de
Pompadour, who followed it in the Starr Report equivalent of the
age, the vice squad chronicles of illegal sexual activities
submitted to them by the police for nominally righteous purposes.
Cos fan tutti, and, actually, plus ca change.

 MOAB IS MY WASHPOT

<P>
   An Autobiography.

 &UR; OVER EDOM WILL I CAST OUT MY SHOE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BY RANDY COHEN
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In 1775, Samuel Johnson contemplated the English educational
system and concluded, ``There is now less flogging in our great
schools than formerly, but then less is learned there; so that what
the boys get at one end, they lose at the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Two hundred years later, when Stephen Fry attended school,
enthusiasm for thrashing as a pedagogical method had diminished but
not disappeared, and each master preserved his own style: ``Angus
in his day beat me many times, always with gentle sorrow. Mid Kemp
sliced me from time to time with a rather mad, rather frightening
glazed boredom. Cromie beat me more than anyone since his reign as
proper headmaster coincided with my rise from infancy to boyhood,
from naughtiness to wickedness. When he beat me it was always with
a glum resignation.''
</P>
<P>
   The bizarre world of the English boarding school is the setting
for ``Moab Is My Washpot,'' Fry's engaging memoir of his boyhood,
and it is as curious a culture as anything you'd encounter up the
Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what you see there may frighten and confuse you _ the
odd clothes, the incomprehensible slang, the bellicose games, the
complex social hierarchies, the revolting food and the bewildering
erotic customs whereby any boy might have sex with another boy but
only certain boys are branded ``queer.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all good anthropological expeditions, this one begins with
a railway journey. Fry sends himself off to school and us off into
his life with wit and charm: ``After one of those squealing,
juddering, stomach-dropping false starts with which trains so
tactlessly articulate human emotion, we pulled ourselves out of the
great shed of Paddington and steamed west.''
</P>
<P>
   Fry has a knack for depicting childhood's unhappiness, but
because we know, in effect, how the story will come out _ Fry the
adult will become a fine and successful comic actor _ it is
tempting to dismiss each transient episode of teen-age torment. But
of course young Fry had no knowledge of the agreeable adulthood
awaiting him, and even if he had, he wouldn't have been comforted.
Like many unhappy adolescents _ i.e., adolescents _ he is fiercely
loyal to his misery, denouncing any future happiness as a betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   Here's Fry at 16: ``I tell you now that everything I feel now,
everything I am now is truer and better than anything I shall ever
be. Ever.'' This was not to be read until he'd forgotten youthful
truth in his decrepitude at the age of 25.
</P>
<P>
   Fry's juvenile self-absorption is apparent when he writes of
love. Despite his claim that his schoolmate Matthew was the hub
around which his adolescence turned, that position seems occupied
not by this paragon but by Fry himself. Nothing wrong with that.
His is a story of adolescence, and narcissism is a privilege of
that age. But if Fry wants to assign that place to his beloved, one
wishes Matthew were more vividly present.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew does come to life in ``The Liar,'' Fry's 1991 novel, in
the guise of a character called Cartwright. In a kind of laboratory
experiment, many of the events Fry presents as memoir he'd
previously rendered as fiction, often to greater effect.
</P>
<P>
   In the memoir, he sometimes succumbs to the temptation to
reflect on the meaning of things, to provide an overview, to speak
in generalities. But in his novel he is specific, and a few
sentences, a brief scene rich with detail, convey the texture and
turbulence of his school days more movingly than whole sections of
the memoir.
</P>
<P>
   Spend enough time with someone in close quarters _ a long car
trip, a lengthy memoir _ and an unimportant mannerism can become
infuriating. In Fry's case it is list making. Time and again,
rather than selecting the one word to convey his meaning, he tosses
a dozen onto the page. It's not padding; it's exuberance, it's
riffing, it's an ill-advised generosity. And it's more annoying
each time he does it. For instance:
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a word which still means much to the English and
which was for many years a rod for my back, a spur to prick the
sides of my intent, a Fury from which to flee, a nemesis, an enemy,
an anathema, a totem, a bugaboo and an accusation.'' (The word, by
the way, is ``healthy.'')
</P>
<P>
   Fry lists people who are old, winter activities, insights easily
achieved through LSD, songs commonly sung at the piano, songs often
played on record, effects that can be achieved by language,
unpleasant things he'd rather do than seem to admire intelligence,
expressions used by schoolmasters, things that seem to be camp but
are not and foods that are tasty but not strictly necessary for
survival.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Fry's voice grows stronger as his story builds _ or
perhaps disintegrates _ to his youthful breakdown when, at 18,
having flunked out or been thrown out of several schools, he is
arrested for stealing and using a credit card. When he lands in
jail, Fry finds it not so bad because he'd been well trained for
life behind bars. ``Life in prison was a breeze for me, because at
that point I'd spent most of life at boarding school.'' And of
course in prison, he was much less likely to be beaten.

 BOOKS IN BRIEF: NONFICTION
 THERE'S NO SUBSTITUTE FOR FIELDWORK
<TEXT>
<P>
   BY SUZANNE MACNEILLE
</P>
<P>
   The pioneering Polish ethnographer Bronislaw Malinowski had an
ambivalent attitude toward photography, which, he said, ``I hate
above all other things.'' Yet he photographed extensively as part
of his fieldwork in Kiriwina, one of the largest of the Trobriand
Islands in the South Pacific. Beginning in 1914, Malinowski
documented in five monographs, including the classic ``Argonauts of
the Western Pacific,'' the beliefs, rituals and quotidian habits of
the islanders. With great aggravation, he lugged around his
ungainly photographic equipment -- a monstrous cross on the
Golgotha of life.'' Nonetheless, Malinowski found photography to be
an indispensible tool and took more than 1,000 pictures of the
gardeners and animists whose traditional sula -- the inter-island
trade of shells and other goods -- became, in academic settings, a
widely used paradigm of traditional economic exchange. ``No other
anthropologist of Malinowski's generation made photographs work so
hard,'' Michael W. Young writes in MALINOWSKI'S KIRIWINA: Fieldwork
Photography 1915-1918 (University of Chicago, $40). Nearly 200
previously unpublished photographs are arranged in 14 visual essays
with headings like ``Magic'' and ``Mortuary Rites and Exchanges.''
Perhaps the most alluring sequence is ``Masawa Canoes and the Kula
Quest,'' which depicts rituals associated with the shell trade and
the construction of the islanders' boats, with their graceful sails
of dried pandanus leaves sewn with awls of flying fox bone.
Undoubtedly, this book will be of primary interest to those in the
social sciences, but the engagingly written text and colorful
quotations from Malinowski's letters, diaries and books will make
it a pleasure for the general reader. Young, senior fellow in the
Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies at the Australian
National University, makes the point that his book is, in many
ways, less an objective study of the islanders than a portrait of
Malinowski and ``his vision of his Trobriand world.''

   ``I am not really sure it's possible for me to look at anything
directly,'' Mary Cappello confesses midway through ``Night Bloom,''
as if to excuse the myriad metaphors in her sometimes colorful,
frequently meandering memoir. Cappello, who teaches English at the
University of Rhode Island, shifts between past and present tenses
to reconstruct the experiences of her immigrant forebears and to
chronicle her own grim childhood in a working-class Philadelphia
suburb. Much of what she describes is chilling: the murder of a
neighbor, her father's explosive temper, the erosion of her
grandfather's faith in the possibility of prosperity in the United
States. Amid this somber landscape, however, Cappello finds reason
to rejoice. In particular, she relishes tending flowers; the
ephemeral blossoms of the cereus, for example, offer her a respite
from hardships both current and remembered. She regards her desire
to write as a legacy from her grandfather and interweaves fragments
from his writings. Unfortunately, the frequent interruption of
pop-academic musings weakens this memoir significantly. By
introducing discussions of ``systems of oppression'' and the
``poetics of loss,'' Cappello overintellectualizes the otherwise
gripping memories she describes. Moreover, her penchant for seeking
hidden meaning in just about everything, from a pair of scissors to
birthday candles, quickly grows tiresome. She disregards her
concern about becoming ``metaphor-crazed,'' and this predilection
makes portions of her memoir downright unintelligible. But when
Cappello restrains herself from such overindulgence, her writing
shines and, like the flowers she cherishes, offers fleeting
glimpses of beauty. _ Sara Ivry

   WHAT HER BODY THOUGHT
</P>
<P>
   A Journey Into the Shadows.
</P>
<P>
   By Susan Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   HarperSanFrancisco, $24.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Griffin's book is like an old car: it's clunky and awkward
at the start, but once it gets going, it more or less works. An
amalgam of genres -- memoir, cultural criticism, political
argument, historical investigation and spiritual meditation -- What
Her Body Thought'' centers first on Griffin's own illness. More
than a decade ago, before it was recognized by the medical
community, she became afflicted with chronic fatigue immune
dysfunction syndrome. The simply but stiffly described details of
her sickness read heavily, as she repeatedly walks her reader
through symptom after symptom, both physical (numbness, loss of
concentration and memory, nausea, insomnia, muscle ache) and mental
(initial denial of her affliction, loneliness, a sense of
abandonment). But once she looks outside her own condition, she
begins making complex and highly opinionated connections between
the individual mind and body and society, and her tone becomes
decidedly more authentic. New Age enemies (and grammarians),
beware: Griffin thinks nothing of throwing out vague holistic
sentiments like ``Turning my attention toward sense, movement,
sensation, taking in the great breadth and complexities, the
intricacies of physical experience, I feel a kind of relief in
response and then gratitude, as if flesh were glad to be known, a
steady stream of what feels like love saturating the substance of
my existence.'' _ Alexandra Hall

   INDIANA GOTHIC
</P>
<P>
   A Story of Adultery and Murder in an American Family.
</P>
<P>
   By Pope Brock.

<P>
   Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, $24.95.
</P>
<P>
   A woman has an affair, and a child, with her brother-in-law, who
is shot on the street by her enraged husband. Pope Brock has turned
this tawdry tale of his great-grandfather Ham Dillon's murder, and
the betrayals that he spun and that spun around him, into ``Indiana
Gothic,'' which nimbly illuminates the stain of adultery spreading
disaster across so many lives. In his turn-of-the-20th-century
setting with a turn-of-the-21st-century sensibility, Brock winks at
the weird science of the medicine (electricity cures), psychiatry
(alienists abound) and law (with plenty of ``knotty and fractious
testimony'') of the time. ``Instead of going up to Michigan, for
the cornflakes and magic shows, you chose to enter the heart of
darkness,'' the prosecuting attorney says to the avenging husband,
Link Hale, who, until he pulled the trigger, had been a depressive,
obsessive mope on his way -- and out of his wife's way -- to John
Kellogg's Battle Creek Sanitarium for a ``cure.'' Brock has a gift
for making a reader shift sympathies. Is murder simply a question
of law, or is blame assessed on the basis of who hurt whom the
most? A freelance magazine journalist, Brock knows how to tell a
good story -- perhaps one that is too good. His unveiling of the
inevitable affair and the just-as-inevitable murder is as elegantly
wrought as the finest of fiction. He has reimagined and rendered
whole and human the way his family members thought, felt and acted
more than 90 years ago. ``Indiana Gothic'' is being sold as
nonfiction, even though parts of it have clearly been invented. But
whatever it is called, it is well worth reading. _ Andrea Higbie

   WAITING FOR APHRODITE
</P>
<P>
   Journeys Into the Time Before Bones.
</P>
<P>
   By Sue Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton Mifflin, $24.
</P>
<P>
   ``We humans are a minority of giants stumbling around in a world
of little things,'' Sue Hubbell writes in ``Waiting for
Aphrodite,'' which begins when she gives up her bee farm in the
Missouri Ozarks to move onto five acres in coastal Maine. On land
and sea, the invertebrates make up the largest and most diverse
phylum of animal life, ranging from sponges to spiders, from the
honeybee to the lobster. They could all get along nicely without
us, as they did for millions of years; but we could not survive
long without them -- about a third of the food we eat depends upon
pollination by insects. Hubbell is a master of the science writer's
necessary art of explaining -- what is taxonomy, cladistics,
punctuated equilibrium (or ``punk eek''); what distinguishes an
animal from a plant. In the realm of small things, the smallest
details are significant: when Martha, the last passenger pigeon,
expired, two species of lice became extinct with her; while we
humans favor the spider's orb (like Charlotte's web), the common
cobweb is more efficient at entangling prey, and therefore marks an
evolutionary advance. Such odd and colorful bits fill the book, but
Hubbell's message is one that all biologists today repeat: that the
diversity of life -- with its 370,000 known and 10 million
estimated species of beetles, its million or more varieties of
ocean life -- is essential to the stability and endurance of our
own lives. _ David Walton

 BOOKS IN BRIEF: FICTION
 OUT OF THE MOUTHS OF BUBBAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BY BRUCE BARCOTT
</P>
<P>
   ``My South,'' Tom Franklin writes in the introduction to
POACHERS (Morrow, $22), his debut story collection, ``is lower
Alabama, lush and green and full of death, the wooded counties
between the Alabama and Tombigbee rivers.'' It's territory
populated with good ol' boys down on their bad ol' luck. Franklin,
a son of Alabama who has never felt at home there, brings together
an engaging collection of sympathetic losers caught in tough
situations and almost-interesting jobs. A series of bad bets turns
a factory foreman into his bookie's indentured servant. An
alcoholic who lives off his successful younger brother is asked to
do little bro' a favor: kill his sister-in-law's cats while she's
on vacation. A ground-water contamination inspector, instead of
shutting down a leaky gas station, conspires with the owner to
cover up the mess in exchange for the pump jockey's stuffed dead
rhino. In this last story, ``Dinosaurs,'' Franklin takes a Southern
cliche -- the chain-smoking, oily-overall-wearing cinder-block
station owner -- and turns him into a memorable character with just
a few lines of dialogue. The old man answers the young inspector's
remark about doing good for the environment with an incredulous
snap: ``The environment?'' he says. ``Take you a good long look out
the window yonder at the environment.'' With all these bad
husbands, ne'er-do-well buddies and frayed marriages, it's as if
the author kidnapped Raymond Carver's characters and set them loose
in the Deep South. Franklin isn't challenging Carver's mastery yet,
but with this satisfying collection he establishes himself as one
of the region's more interesting emerging voices.

</P>
<P>
   Stories.
</P>
<P>
   By William Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   University of Missouri, paper, $17.95.
</P>
<P>
   If journalists are pesky gnats, then short-story writers, as
defined by William Hoffman, are observant flies on the wall. In
``Doors,'' his fourth collection of stories, Hoffman flits among 10
houses, most of them in the fictional town of Tobaccoton, Va.,
absorbing the kind of detail about character and class -- from
white-collar to redneck -- that both illuminates the heart of the
matter and burrows in the brain. When a woman owns a black satin
painting of Willie Nelson holding a banjo, ``his face giving off
sunbeams and favoring Jesus,'' we don't have to wonder if she's
ever been bowling. Throughout, Hoffman explores the secret
yearnings of his characters, the lengths they go to in putting on
appearances and how they handle the temptation to cross lines of
color, circumstance and creed to find the passion and truth that
elude them. The black businessman of ``Stones'' offers friendship
to a white teen-ager who is too blinded by racism to accept it; the
pathetic farmer of ``Winter Wheat'' finds chilling meaning in the
Bible when his wife takes a lover. The majority of Hoffman's tales
don't so much end as fade away, leaving the reader aching for the
resolution of ``Tenant,'' a tense interplay between an ambitious
couple and the convicted murderer in their employ. Still, Hoffman's
grasp of the subtleties of human nature and his lyrical use of
language make Tobaccoton an attractive, if offbeat, destination. _

   SNOW MAN
</P>
<P>
   By Carolyn Chute.
</P>
<P>
   Harcourt Brace, $23.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Chute has written good novels (``The Beans of Egypt,
Maine'') and bad ones (``Merry Men''), but nothing in her past work
quite prepares you for ``Snow Man,'' an absurd and rather ugly
political thriller that asks you to sympathize with a Maine militia
member who murders a United States senator. Class resentment has
always simmered below the surface of Chute's work, and here that
resentment is transformed into rage. Robert Drummond, this novel's
violent working-class hero -- he is described as a ``pure human
being'' and a ``beautiful ordinary man'' despite the swastika
that's tattooed on his arm -- is a member of the Snow Men, a
pro-gun, anti-corporate backwoods sect. When Drummond murders a
senator in Boston and is wounded himself, he improbably takes
refuge in the home of another senator, whose wife and daughter
surreptitiously nurse him back to health. (Drummond seduces both
women, cartoonish liberals who urge him, in bed, to do his ``ugly
bear'' thing and his ``Mr. Right Wing thing.'') Chute uses the
killer's extended stay to evoke the plight of Maine's working poor
-- Drummond has lost his farm, his family lacks health insurance --
and to deliver scattershot rants about the sorry state of the
Government. These rants are not subtle: the dead senator is likened
to ``a maggot in a brimming garbage can''; the First Lady is
described as an ``arrogant bitch broad femmie-Ms. wifey.'' The
crude sermonizing in ``Snow Man'' makes it plain that the activist
in Carolyn Chute has, for now, silenced the novelist in her. _

   MY PHANTOM HUSBAND
</P>
<P>
   By Marie Darrieussecq.
</P>
<P>
   New Press, $19.95.
</P>
<P>
   When a beautiful young woman's husband unaccountably disappears
on a domestic errand one evening, the terror of her nights and the
disorientation of her days produce hallucinatory images, gory
speculations and manic-depressive actions. In her second novel,
translated from the French by Esther Allen, Marie Darrieussecq
writes chiseled, brightly faceted sentences that evoke her
heroine's contrasting emotional temblors and peculiar perceptual
glints -- e.g., that the physical objects of a shared living space
are ``solidification of void.'' Some readers will dismiss this kind
of exercise as claustrophobic and overintellectualized; others will
admire a confidently original writer's kaleidoscopic analysis of
spiritual crisis. The latter may especially appreciate
Darrieussecq's crafty exposition. Even as her bluestocking heroine
flirts with madness, we learn solid truths about her chilly
marriage to a real estate agent and her relationships with a
distant mother and a vulgar friend. In the outside world that may
explain the heroine's passivity, a 20th-century city is built from
such details as sea lions exploding in a mined harbor and an exotic
underclass with blue-tinted skin. At the same time, the heroine's
cosmic imagination links, in startling conjunctions, discoveries of
contemporary science -- from hermit crab anatomy to an experiment
in quantum physics. Eventually, the heroine learns what Nathaniel
Hawthorne wrote in ``Wakefield,'' his short story on a similar
theme: ``It is perilous to make a chasm in human affection.''
Whether her husband left or was taken from her, she gains balance
enough to write her story, thus validating her new singularity and
letting deep water close over him. _ Charles Flowers

   KING
</P>
<P>
   A Street Story.
</P>
<P>
   By John Berger.
</P>
<P>
   Pantheon, $20.
</P>
<P>
   John Berger has been paring down his style. His novel ``To the
Wedding'' (1995) was composed with language that sounded timeless,
as if recited by an ancient bard. In his new book he's sparer yet,
and less successful. The setting is a homeless encampment by a
freeway near an unnamed city. We are in an allegorical world
reminiscent of Troy, the ``global city'' in Berger's earlier novel
``Lilac and Flag.'' The dump's inhabitants have polyglot names like
Joachim, Corinna, Saul and Liberto. The events of a single day,
which turns out to be the last day for the little community, are
narrated by a dog named King. He guards the ramshackle huts, and he
lives with Vico and Vica, an old couple who once had another life,
full of laughter and books and enough money to keep out ``the first
hopelessness'' that ``begins when you cannot imagine anything ever
being dry again.'' Vico tells King the same stories over and over
because, aside from a thick coat, they are his only valuable
possessions. On this day, Vico goes to town to sell some radishes
he's grown on stolen soil, and Vica, accompanied by King, wheels a
grocery cart to the gas station, where she fills her cans with
water. Rumors float around the camp about the city's plans to raze
it and develop the site into a stadium. That night, as everyone
sleeps, King sees them coming: the jeep, the soldiers and, worst of
all, ``the massive engine'' and ``the noise of stones being torn
like linen.'' Witness and bard, King resembles the Aesop-like
chronicler of ``To the Wedding'' and the Greek-chorus narrators of
``Lilac and Flag.'' His nonhuman gaze of pity and mourning for
people treated like garbage, his gnomic judgments, create a formal
distance between the reader and the characters. Although the
individual portraits of Vica, Vico and the rest are beautifully
drawn, we're constantly reminded that King really is a pet, who
goes around sniffing at hermit crabs and mushrooms. It's just too
hard to believe in a poetic dog. _ Brigitte Frase

ADIRONDACK CHAIRS HAVE ROOTS IN THE FOREST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The Adirondack chair did indeed originate within
the Adirondack forest preserve in New York.
</P>
<P>
   This sturdy classic features a sloped back and seat angle that
is just as comfortable as an upholstered club chair, making it a
mainstay in outdoor furniture across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The first Adirondack chair, with its 4-inch-wide arms for a
drink or book, was designed in 1903 by Thomas Lee for his home in
Westport, N.Y., according to Ann Stillman O'Leary's book
``Adirondack Style'' (1998, Clarkson Potter, $37.50). It was
originally called the Westport chair.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, owner of the famous Westport Mountain Spring, suggested
that a carpenter friend named Harry Bunnell make a few of the
chairs to sell, according to O'Leary, and Bunnell applied for the
patent. Bunnell's chairs were all signed, made of hemlock and
stackable.
</P>
<P>
   As with any popular furniture design, designers and craftsmen
soon began putting a spin on the original model, such as doubling
them in size and adding rockers to modifying the shape of and
design of the back.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Adirondack chair is manufactured in several woods:
pine, oak, cedar, mahogany, cherry and teak. Most come unfinished.
</P>
<P>
   Adirondack chairs originally cost less than $4. Today, depending
on their condition, original Adirondack chairs are worth $1,250 or
more, according to Ted Comstock of Ithaca, N.Y., who is an
appraiser of antique Adirondack items. When he worked for the
Adirondack Museum, Comstock curated the museum's first exhibit of
rustic furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   Rustic furniture includes both twig and Adirondack types, but
the former may use bark and roots while the latter is made solely
of pine.
</P>
<P>
   The price for Adirondack chairs depends on the size, age,
condition and original finish and whether it is a signed Westport,
Comstock said. Original colors were green or a medium dark brown.
</P>
<P>
   New Adirondack chairs vary in price and design. Jerry Amerine in
Speculator, in Hamilton County, N.Y., makes several varieties, from
a Westport style to the High Peaks style. His Westports sell for
$70 unfinished, but new Adirondack chairs can cost $200 or more,
according to retailers.
</P>
<P>
   If that's more than you want to spend, green plastic copies sell
for $14.99. They are so popular that they are already back-ordered
at stores such as Bed Bath &AMP; Beyond.

EX-G-MAN PROFILES A LIFETIME ANALYZING CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL LOPEZ  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the book ``The Evil That Men Do,'' profiler Roy Hazelwood
relates his first FBI case: the recovery of a vacuum cleaner,
vanished for five years from a naval base.
</P>
<P>
   Discovering that the Navy personnel who borrowed the vacuum
simply gave it away, piece by piece, Hazelwood traced everyone
connected to the missing cleaner. Showing up on doorsteps with the
pronouncement, ``I'm with the FBI. Do you have a piece of this
vacuum cleaner?'' Hazelwood gradually reassembled the cleaner, and
presented it, with a few choice words, to his supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for Hazelwood, his FBI career would lead to more
fascinating cases. Among the approximately 10,000 serial murders
and rapes, mutilations, explosions and other mayhem, Hazelwood
helped investigate the Atlanta child murders; also the notorious
assault allegations of Tawana Brawley, who a grand jury determined
made up the racially inflammatory story; and the turret explosion
aboard the USS Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   But the case of the missing vacuum cleaner illustrates
Hazelwood's methodical approach to criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Hazelwood spent 16 years of his 22-year FBI career in the
bureau's Behavioral Science Unit, investigating and researching in
particular violent sex crimes. A profiler, or crime analyst,
Hazelwood assembled portraits of unknown offenders from behavioral
clues left at the crime scene. The BSU's work became widely known
through the novel and subsequent movie, ``The Silence of the
Lambs,'' and profilers are featured on two current television
series.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen G. Michaud, the Dallas writer perhaps best known for
interviewing notorious serial killer Ted Bundy for the book ``The
Only Living Witness,'' is the co-author of ``The Evil that Men Do''
(St. Martins Press, 256 pages, $25). He credits Hazelwood with
several significant research breakthroughs at the FBI Academy at
Quantico, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Hazelwood explored the accidental deaths resulting from
autoerotic asphyxia, when people purposely cut off their own oxygen
flow to achieve a high and supposedly to enhance sexual arousal. A
sex-crimes instructor, Hazelwood ``typed'' rapists by motivation
and, thus, level of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Hazelwood helped built a system for the behavioral approach to
criminal investigation, according to Michaud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roy is remarkably quiet and self-effacing about his
achievement and what he does,'' Michaud said. ``Outside of the
law-enforcement circle, before our book was published, he was
hardly known and I think he liked it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Hazelwood, a man quick to laugh but careful in speech, does not
set profilers apart as select people operating on an inaccessible,
intuitive plane. The qualities of a profiler _ maturity, curiosity,
common sense and open-mindedness among them _ in fact sound like a
prescription for leading a rich, sensible life. Quoting Nobel
Prize-winning biochemist Albert Szent-Gyorgyi, Hazelwood summarizes
profiling: ``Discovery is looking at what everyone else has seen
and thinking what no one else has thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Hazelwood, whose slight youthful rebellion in small-town Texas
and family dysfunction did not spell future crime expert, first
became fascinated by sex offenders as a young officer in the
Military Police Corps. Harvey Glatman, the ``Lonely Hearts
Killer,'' had just been executed for the rape and murder of women
he met through a lonely-hearts club.
</P>
<P>
   This was the late 1950s and early 1960s, and the sexual offense
was largely unexplored investigative territory. Crime specialists
could not explain Glatman's elaborate killing ritual, including the
elaborate bondage with which he secured his victims.
</P>
<P>
   Hazelwood wanted to know, and the case set him on a quest to
understand the mind of the sex offender, whose rituals during the
crime are so connected to their self-gratification.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Evil that Men Do'' is an annal of human depravity _
behavior that can't be as easy to mentally set aside and
compartmentalize as, say, the stress caused by an irritable boss or
a job deadline.
</P>
<P>
   But Hazelwood says his work depressed him only once when, having
just completed a report on a series of couples murdered while
hiking, he learned of yet another couple who had just been killed.
</P>
<P>
   He took two weeks off, and painted his house. ``At that point in
time, I made a decision, which was: This was not my life, this was
my work. If it becomes part of your life, you become part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hazelwood, now 61, retired from the FBI in 1994 and now is an
associate of the Academy Group, a private forensic consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Hazelwood weighs in on a recent wave of crime: school violence.
Sounding a call for parental involvement in children's lives,
Hazelwood, a father of five, said the violence is occurring in an
increasingly shameless society that has lost a sense of
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to project the blame on all of these outside sources.
. .. We then have to look at the individual as being responsible
for what he did.''

AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUBY MASCHKE  
 c.1999 Huron Daily Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAD AXE, Mich. _ Last week we observed Memorial Day on May 31.
Next week we will honor the flag on Flag Day, June 14.
</P>
<P>
   It would be hard to think of Memorial Day without thinking about
the American flag. It would be equally hard to think of the
American flag without thinking of all the men and women who fought
and died defending our country. This column is a bridge between
those two noteworthy days.
</P>
<P>
   I looked up some of the prose and poetry written by patriotic
persons.
</P>
<P>
   But even as I read each poem and each article, the words of one
person kept weaving in and out of my reading. The words were those
of Katherine Lee Bates, who wrote ``America the Beautiful.''
Perhaps that most patriotic and descriptive gem needs a close-up,
line-by-line scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``O beautiful for spacious skies''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the temperature is more agreeable, I've resumed my
habit of early morning coffee outdoors, watching the sunrise in
those spacious skies. Not sky, but many skies, each one different.
Sometimes gorgeous shades of pink, sometimes fluffy white clouds
rimmed in rose, sometimes gray-smoke ribbons that form and reform
at the wind's whim. Sometimes patterned by a vee of migrating
geese. An always beautiful sky.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``For amber waves of grain''
</P>
<P>
   A field of wheat, ripe heads bent in submission to the
harvester.
</P>
<P>
   Silken heads of barley rippling in a summer breeze. Grain that
is lovely mellow gold. Grain that means bread for the nation. Once
Jesus said, ``Unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and
dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies it produces
many seeds.'' A field of grain is a million miracles.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``For purple mountain majesty''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most awesome and majestic mountains are those in our
own United States of America. My first view of the Grand Canyon
brought tears to my eyes. Purple, beige, rose, indescribable
striations of color. A helicopter flight revealed unending miles of
purple mountains and deep-sculpted canyons, so awesome my heart was
filled with wonder.
</P>
<P>
   God must have smiled when He created such majesty.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Above the fruited plain.''
</P>
<P>
   Fly across our great country. See the farmland, brown fields
ready for planting, green fields of alfalfa and corn and grain, the
bounteous blessings of many kinds of crops _ all included in the
``fruited plain.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``America! America! God shed His grace on thee''
</P>
<P>
   Bates wrote those words as she viewed the lofty and graceful
Grand Tetons in Wyoming. They were so beautiful, so scenic, she
must have felt the grace, the undeserved love of God for this
country.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``And crown thy good with brotherhood, from sea to shining
sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Name any country of the world. Somewhere in this vast and
wonderful United States of America _ somewhere between the shining
Atlantic and Pacific oceans _ there is someone from any country you
can name. Some people die trying to get to this land of
opportunity, this land of untrammeled freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Verses two and three of the song speak of ``pilgrim feet'' that
``a thoroughfare for freedom beat across the wilderness for heroes
proved in liberating strife, who more than self their country
loved.''
</P>
<P>
   The last verse begins with the words`
</P>
<P>
   _ ``O beautiful for patriot dream that sees beyond the years.''
</P>
<P>
   The far-seeing men who wrote the Constitution were patriots in
the best sense of the word. They pledged their fortunes and their
very lives to gain freedom from British tyranny. They wrote a
document that has served to guide this great country for more than
200 years. Their patriot dreams certainly did reach beyond their
years!
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Thine alabaster cities gleam''
</P>
<P>
   Some people do not care for cities, but many people prefer the
urban life. There are art museums, concert halls, theaters, sleek
shining office buildings _ edifices for entertainment and business
and learning.
</P>
<P>
   At night, look down on a city from high up. Lights sparkle like
jewels tossed across the Earth. A lighted city truly gleams after
dark.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Undimmed by human tears.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you ever sing well-known words without really thinking about
their meaning? What did Katherine Bates have in mind when she wrote
that line? Certainly not the absence of sorrow, for where there are
people, there is sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   We can only guess at her thoughts. Our country _ this sprawling
and mighty U.S. of A. _ has never shed tears because another
country rained destruction on our cities. Our gleaming buildings
stand tall. Perhaps that was the author's thought. I'm sure there
are other interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   The last four lines of this last verse are like those of the
first, a reminder once more of the blessedness of our country. Walt
Whitman wrote a poem about the diversity of America, titled ``I
Hear America Singing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear America singing, the varied carols I hear,
</P>
<P>
   Those of mechanics, each one singing his as it should be blithe
and strong
</P>
<P>
   The carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam,
</P>
<P>
   The mason singing his as he makes ready for work, or leaves off
work,
</P>
<P>
   The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat, the deck
hand singing on the steamboat deck,
</P>
<P>
   The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench, the hatter
singing as he stands,
</P>
<P>
   The woodcutter's song, the plowboy's on his way in the morning,
or at noon intermission or at sundown,
</P>
<P>
   The delicious singing of the mother, or of the young wife at
work, or of the girl sewing or washing,
</P>
<P>
   Each singing what belongs to him or her and to no one else,
</P>
<P>
   The day what belongs to the day _ at night the party of young
fellows, robust, friendly,
</P>
<P>
   Singing with open mouths their strong melodious songs.''

   ST. PETER'S, Montserrat _ To hear Nancy Burke tell it, this
island's string of natural disasters began with the flash floods of
1981. Those were followed by the earthquake in 1985, followed by
Hurricane Hugo in 1989, followed by the eruption of the Soufriere
Hills volcano in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly this tiny island has had more than its share of bad
luck, so much so that some Montserratians believe God is trying to
tell them something.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even an erupting volcano hasn't been able to persuade Burke
and her husband, Richard Hermany(CQ), to permanently abandon their
comfortable villa here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing left is fire or locusts,'' reasoned Burke, 57.
``But we love it here. We couldn't afford to live like this back in
the states.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke is a chatty, one-time belly dancer from Manhattan. Her
husband earned a living on Broadway, performing in shows such as
``Hello Dolly!'' with Ginger Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   The pair bought their spacious abode, which includes a 42-foot
swimming pool -- as well as a guest house and another swimming pool
-- in 1992 for less than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here trust one another completely,'' Burke said. ``You
never even have to lock your doors.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing lacking? ``A good dentist,'' claimed Hermany, 71.
</P>
<P>
   Before the volcano, this island was an upscale tourist
destination that supported 12,000 people. It also was a popular
spot for American retirees. Whereas other islands have had cricket;
Montserrat has had golf.
</P>
<P>
   Then the volcano unexpectedly sprang to life, killing at least
19 people, forcing two-thirds of the population into exile, and
rendering most of Montserrat unfit for human habitation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, what's often been called the Emerald Isle, in part
because of its lushness, has remained a powerful magnet for
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps hundreds of expatriates either spend winters here, or
live here year-round, mostly in a northern ``safe zone'' that
encompasses about a third of this 39-square-mile British territory.
</P>
<P>
   An American couple, Robert and Beverly Kleeb from Howell, Mich.,
are the only people to openly defy a government order to leave the
so-called ``danger zone'' near the volcano.
</P>
<P>
   They say all their money's tied up in their $800,000 villa,
perched high atop a cliff above the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   They refuse to abandon their property, powered by a generator,
even though the volcano is still active, spewing hot gases into the
air.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see the island's appeal, however.
</P>
<P>
   Too small and friendly to be intimidating, roads snake passed
shingled cottages that bear cutesy names such as ``Chez Mango,''
and are shaded by breadfruit trees and smothered in mostly pink and
yellow bougainvillea.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone seems to know and care about everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers greet passers-by again and again with a wave and a quick
``toot-toot'' of their horns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans have always liked Montserrat because it's like
living in a small town,'' said Pam Arthurton, owner of Carib-World
Travel, who grew up in Montserrat. ``There is no crime, or drugs,
but there are plenty of good fruits and vegetables.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Mitchell was a vice president for Georgia-Pacific Corp.
before buying a house here with his wife, Marcia, in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started coming here in 1989 and every time we would stay
longer and longer,'' he said. ``We have coffee in the morning and
look out over the ocean and it's spectacular.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mitchells' home has a long veranda overlooking crystal-clear
sea, which they say is perfect for snorkeling. A waterfall just
outside their bedroom window lulls them to sleep each night.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans say they were drawn to Montserrat by pure
economics: a population explosion on many of the Caribbean's larger
islands had made it increasingly difficult to find unspoiled,
reasonably priced property in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason Montserrat's so popular: labor is cheap, with
maids costing $3 to $4 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   This island was first colonized in the mid-1600s by Irish
Catholics who came over from the neighboring, but mostly Protestant
island of St. Kitts. Even now, St. Patrick's Day is a national
holiday, and passports here are stamped with a bright, green
shamrock.
</P>
<P>
   Volcanic in origin, this pear-shaped island has hot mineral
springs. Americans insist the water here's so clean and tasty that
it should be bottled and sold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   One of these Americans is David Lea, from Warren, Ohio, who
moved his family here in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Clover, and their three sons, live in a
treehouse-like dwelling that looks like something straight out of
``The Swiss Family Robinson.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no shortage of hammocks or fresh flowers, a look David
Lea describes as ``well-done hippie.''
</P>
<P>
   There's even a hot tub on the deck with sweeping views of the
sea, and a hydroponics garden, where vegetables grow in
nutrient-rich solution, rather than soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure the kids still play with their Game Boy, but they also
swing on ropes,'' David Lea said. ``Our children use their
imaginations, just like I did when I was growing up.''

   CORK HILL, Montserrat _ Nearly four years after it awakened,
Montserrat's volcano is still an unpredictable one. It spews ash
and clouds of hot gases in violent burps and coughs, even as it's
supposed to be going back to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   In the volcano's shadow is a once-verdant landscape turned gray
and dreary under a thick blanket of fine, gritty ash.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, the tenacious people of this tiny British
territory are rebuilding their lives with an optimism that belies
the seriousness of living with a natural disaster year after year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are looking up,'' said Valerie Romeo of Romeo's Wayside
Hardware.
</P>
<P>
   She said business has been booming even though she's been forced
to relocate her store twice in recent years, each time farther away
from the erupting volcano.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, this pear-shaped Caribbean island -- part of the
Leeward chain -- was dubbed the Emerald Isle. The reference was, in
part, a nod to the tropical lushness that for years attracted
upscale tourists.
</P>
<P>
   But all that changed in July 1995 when Montserrat's
long-smoldering volcano, Soufriere Hills(CQ), blew its stack after
nearly four centuries of dormancy. It eventually killed 19 people,
obliterated the economy and wiped out Plymouth, the capital, and
other villages.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, there have been periods of repose between eruptions,
prompting many people to return to check on property near the
volcano. A proposition that can have dire consequences as a group
of more than a dozen islanders found out in 1997. They returned to
the so-called ``danger zone'' and were killed when the volcano
erupted without warning, sending ``pyroclastic flows'' -- waves of
900-degree ash, gas and rocks -- down the mountainside at speeds of
100 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the southern two-thirds of the island still aren't fit
for human habitation.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Montserrat with a Herculean task: re-creating its
society in only the northern third of the island.
</P>
<P>
   Montserratians say they're confident they can jump-start both
their lives and their businesses -- particularly tourism --
shattered by the mountain's threat.
</P>
<P>
   Already, a few restaurants have opened. Various other
long-vacant businesses have been reborn. And banks have started to
make loans again so that people might build new houses and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are under the impression that there's no one or nothing
left on this island, but we're here and we're going forward,'' said
Ernestine Cassell, Montserrat's director of tourism.
</P>
<P>
   She said that, only two years ago, everyone thought tourism here
was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I say tourism's not dead because now the island has a
major attraction everyone wants to see, an active volcano,'' she
reasoned.
</P>
<P>
   Although Montserrat's airport has been buried by ash, the island
can be reached via ferry or helicopter from Antigua, 27 miles to
the northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists today believe the volcano is finally settling down
for good. But as it does, eruptions are ongoing, and Soufriere
Hills continues to shoot dark, perilous-looking clouds thousands of
feet into the air.
</P>
<P>
   On May 22, Montserrat experienced at least 150 earthquakes,
albeit minor ones that residents and tourists couldn't detect.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the volcano has spit out a lava that is so thick, it
doesn't flow away easily but accumulates to form a dome -- which is
collapsing, causing ongoing volcanic activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep seeing activity as the volcano goes back to sleep, but
the volcano, overall, is definitely quieting down,'' said Jill
Norton, an English volcanologist at the Montserrat Volcano
Observatory.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, only the northern third of the island -- blocked from
the volcano by huge hills -- is said to be safe.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the island's remaining 4,500 or so residents have
been crammed into an arid, 10-square-mile region, marked by steep
land and corkscrew roads.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the volcano, the 12,000 residents of this island,
only 11 miles long and 7 miles wide, had little room to maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   After the volcano erupted, two-thirds of the island's population
were evacuated to Great Britain or to other Caribbean islands.
</P>
<P>
   The volcano was a double-whammy for Montserratians still reeling
from the wrath of Hurricane Hugo, which ripped across the island in
1989 with winds of up to 150 mph, uprooting 400-year-old trees and
damaging or destroying 95 percent of all structures.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, this will be the second near-total reconstruction of
this island in less than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the reconstruction after Hurricane Hugo was nearly
complete when the eruption took place.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   In the capital Plymouth, which had been this island's nerve
center and most-important city, the atmosphere is one of a ghost
town, where up to 10 feet of ash and rock have buried what was to
be the island's new library, hospital, and governmental buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Ash also has buried Air Studios, where a vast array of stars --
including Jimmy Buffett, Eric Clapton, Elton John, Paul McCartney,
Stevie Wonder, and the Rolling Stones -- recorded music throughout
the 1980s away from the glare of the media spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Montserratian officials operating out of trailers say they hope
to build new government offices in Little Bay, a patch of
mountainside located in the island's northern end. A laundry list
of other hoped-for projects includes a new airport and sporting
complex.
</P>
<P>
   But a lack of funds has, so far, been a stumbling block.
</P>
<P>
   British financial aid has totaled more than $100 million since
1995, but much of the assistance has been spent on ``emergency
needs,'' such as flying in tents and various equipment and setting
up the Montserrat Volcano Observatory.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, it may be months before residents are allowed
to move back into the ``danger zone,'' or the southern part of the
island, mostly because of the health risk posed by the dust.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who ventures into this region is subject to fines, even
arrest since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure no one does so, the area is dotted with big,
menacing signs that read: ``The following hazards are likely to
occur without warning -- pyroclastic flows, mud flows, and ash
falls.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also a small, central buffer zone, which is open only
during daylight hours.
</P>
<P>
   Montserrat Gov. Tony Abbott, a British official, says the island
can build a bright future, but admits it won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a top priority is drawing back Montserratians --
like the 3,500 evacuated to Britain -- many of whom had been the
island's richest and youngest residents. But about 900 people who
remain on the island still need homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This island has not only suffered from physical devastation,
but from social devastation as well,'' Abbott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each village used to look after their own, but now many of
these villages are damaged or destroyed, so there's a need to
establish places for people like the elderly and the mentally
challenged who have nowhere to go,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   He said the British government already has financed the
construction of 250 homes in the ``safe zone,'' and now plans to
implement a low-interest mortgage program.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Even before the volcano erupted, however, tourism was the
backbone of this island's economy. Businesses such as lime, sugar,
and cotton never stuck around for long.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with Plymouth evacuated, and many areas off-limits, it's
hard to entice tourists to come.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department still recommends that U.S. citizens
defer all travel to Montserrat, due to the active volcano. The
warning was even mentioned by popular talk-show hostess Oprah
Winfrey on her May 18 program, further exasperating Montserratians.
</P>
<P>
   Montserrat has always been something of a Caribbean anomaly,
escaping mass-market tourism thanks to its lack of beaches,
casinos, resorts. Even in its heyday, Montserrat never boasted more
than 150 hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Still, tourism boosters point out that before the volcano,
Montserrat attracted 30,000 visitors a year. Last year, it had
declined to about 7,000.
</P>
<P>
   Cassell, the tourism director, hopes to change all that. She
sees the volcano as the island's ticket out of the economic
doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly 4 million people visit Hawaii each year just to see the
volcano, so our volcano can be an attraction as well,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But there are currently no hotel accommodations here, although
tourists can pay to stay in people's homes. A new 18-room hotel,
called Tropical Mansions, is set to open by November, while the Vue
Pointe, the island's biggest hotel before the eruption with 44
rooms, is scheduled to re-open by December.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the 110-passenger Caledonian Star became the first
cruise ship to visit the island since the volcano erupted. Its
passengers were able to get an up-close look at the volcano, as
well as see firsthand the devastation it left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to fight for funds from the British government
so we can make improvements to our port so that more cruise ships
can come,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Arthurton, who owns Carib-World Travel in Antigua, with
another office in Baltimore, said she too has started marketing the
volcano.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to develop adventure tours that include visits to
the volcano because it's my belief that one person's disaster can
be another person's attraction,'' she said.

   History: Columbus spotted Montserrat in 1493, naming if after an
abbey of the same name in Spain. Irish Catholics settled on the
island in the mid-1600s after leaving their uneasy base on the
Protestant island of St. Kitts.

   Volcano's history: The Soufriere Hills Volcano erupted in July
1995 after nearly four centuries of dormancy. By 1997 it had killed
at least 19 people, forced two-thirds of the population into exile,
and rendered most of the island unsafe for human habitation. The
volcano is still active, though it is becoming dormant.

   ST. PETER'S, Montserrat _ To hear Nancy Burke tell it, this
island's string of natural disasters began with the flash floods of
1981. Those were followed by the earthquake in 1985, followed by
Hurricane Hugo in 1989, followed by the eruption of the Soufriere
Hills volcano in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly this tiny island has had more than its share of bad
luck, so much so that some Montserratians believe God is trying to
tell them something.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even an erupting volcano hasn't been able to persuade Burke
and her husband, Richard Hermany(CQ), to permanently abandon their
comfortable villa here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing left is fire or locusts,'' reasoned Burke, 57.
``But we love it here. We couldn't afford to live like this back in
the states.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke is a chatty, one-time belly dancer from Manhattan. Her
husband earned a living on Broadway, performing in shows such as
``Hello Dolly!'' with Ginger Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   The pair bought their spacious abode, which includes a 42-foot
swimming pool -- as well as a guest house and another swimming pool
-- in 1992 for less than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here trust one another completely,'' Burke said. ``You
never even have to lock your doors.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing lacking? ``A good dentist,'' claimed Hermany, 71.
</P>
<P>
   Before the volcano, this island was an upscale tourist
destination that supported 12,000 people. It also was a popular
spot for American retirees. Whereas other islands have had cricket;
Montserrat has had golf.
</P>
<P>
   Then the volcano unexpectedly sprang to life, killing at least
19 people, forcing two-thirds of the population into exile, and
rendering most of Montserrat unfit for human habitation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, what's often been called the Emerald Isle, in part
because of its lushness, has remained a powerful magnet for
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps hundreds of expatriates either spend winters here, or
live here year-round, mostly in a northern ``safe zone'' that
encompasses about a third of this 39-square-mile British territory.
</P>
<P>
   An American couple, Robert and Beverly Kleeb from Howell, Mich.,
are the only people to openly defy a government order to leave the
so-called ``danger zone'' near the volcano.
</P>
<P>
   They say all their money's tied up in their $800,000 villa,
perched high atop a cliff above the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   They refuse to abandon their property, powered by a generator,
even though the volcano is still active, spewing hot gases into the
air.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see the island's appeal, however.
</P>
<P>
   Too small and friendly to be intimidating, roads snake passed
shingled cottages that bear cutesy names such as ``Chez Mango,''
and are shaded by breadfruit trees and smothered in mostly pink and
yellow bougainvillea.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone seems to know and care about everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers greet passers-by again and again with a wave and a quick
``toot-toot'' of their horns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans have always liked Montserrat because it's like
living in a small town,'' said Pam Arthurton, owner of Carib-World
Travel, who grew up in Montserrat. ``There is no crime, or drugs,
but there are plenty of good fruits and vegetables.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Mitchell was a vice president for Georgia-Pacific Corp.
before buying a house here with his wife, Marcia, in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started coming here in 1989 and every time we would stay
longer and longer,'' he said. ``We have coffee in the morning and
look out over the ocean and it's spectacular.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mitchells' home has a long veranda overlooking crystal-clear
sea, which they say is perfect for snorkeling. A waterfall just
outside their bedroom window lulls them to sleep each night.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans say they were drawn to Montserrat by pure
economics: a population explosion on many of the Caribbean's larger
islands had made it increasingly difficult to find unspoiled,
reasonably priced property in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason Montserrat's so popular: labor is cheap, with
maids costing $3 to $4 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   This island was first colonized in the mid-1600s by Irish
Catholics who came over from the neighboring, but mostly Protestant
island of St. Kitts. Even now, St. Patrick's Day is a national
holiday, and passports here are stamped with a bright, green
shamrock.
</P>
<P>
   Volcanic in origin, this pear-shaped island has hot mineral
springs. Americans insist the water here's so clean and tasty that
it should be bottled and sold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   One of these Americans is David Lea, from Warren, Ohio, who
moved his family here in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Clover, and their three sons, live in a
treehouse-like dwelling that looks like something straight out of
``The Swiss Family Robinson.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no shortage of hammocks or fresh flowers, a look David
Lea describes as ``well-done hippie.''
</P>
<P>
   There's even a hot tub on the deck with sweeping views of the
sea, and a hydroponics garden, where vegetables grow in
nutrient-rich solution, rather than soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure the kids still play with their Game Boy, but they also
swing on ropes,'' David Lea said. ``Our children use their
imaginations, just like I did when I was growing up.''

   CORK HILL, Montserrat _ Nearly four years after it awakened,
Montserrat's volcano is still an unpredictable one. It spews ash
and clouds of hot gases in violent burps and coughs, even as it's
supposed to be going back to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   In the volcano's shadow is a once-verdant landscape turned gray
and dreary under a thick blanket of fine, gritty ash.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, the tenacious people of this tiny British
territory are rebuilding their lives with an optimism that belies
the seriousness of living with a natural disaster year after year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are looking up,'' said Valerie Romeo of Romeo's Wayside
Hardware.
</P>
<P>
   She said business has been booming even though she's been forced
to relocate her store twice in recent years, each time farther away
from the erupting volcano.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, this pear-shaped Caribbean island -- part of the
Leeward chain -- was dubbed the Emerald Isle. The reference was, in
part, a nod to the tropical lushness that for years attracted
upscale tourists.
</P>
<P>
   But all that changed in July 1995 when Montserrat's
long-smoldering volcano, Soufriere Hills(CQ), blew its stack after
nearly four centuries of dormancy. It eventually killed 19 people,
obliterated the economy and wiped out Plymouth, the capital, and
other villages.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, there have been periods of repose between eruptions,
prompting many people to return to check on property near the
volcano. A proposition that can have dire consequences as a group
of more than a dozen islanders found out in 1997. They returned to
the so-called ``danger zone'' and were killed when the volcano
erupted without warning, sending ``pyroclastic flows'' -- waves of
900-degree ash, gas and rocks -- down the mountainside at speeds of
100 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the southern two-thirds of the island still aren't fit
for human habitation.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Montserrat with a Herculean task: re-creating its
society in only the northern third of the island.
</P>
<P>
   Montserratians say they're confident they can jump-start both
their lives and their businesses -- particularly tourism --
shattered by the mountain's threat.
</P>
<P>
   Already, a few restaurants have opened. Various other
long-vacant businesses have been reborn. And banks have started to
make loans again so that people might build new houses and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are under the impression that there's no one or nothing
left on this island, but we're here and we're going forward,'' said
Ernestine Cassell, Montserrat's director of tourism.
</P>
<P>
   She said that, only two years ago, everyone thought tourism here
was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I say tourism's not dead because now the island has a
major attraction everyone wants to see, an active volcano,'' she
reasoned.
</P>
<P>
   Although Montserrat's airport has been buried by ash, the island
can be reached via ferry or helicopter from Antigua, 27 miles to
the northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists today believe the volcano is finally settling down
for good. But as it does, eruptions are ongoing, and Soufriere
Hills continues to shoot dark, perilous-looking clouds thousands of
feet into the air.
</P>
<P>
   On May 22, Montserrat experienced at least 150 earthquakes,
albeit minor ones that residents and tourists couldn't detect.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the volcano has spit out a lava that is so thick, it
doesn't flow away easily but accumulates to form a dome -- which is
collapsing, causing ongoing volcanic activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep seeing activity as the volcano goes back to sleep, but
the volcano, overall, is definitely quieting down,'' said Jill
Norton, an English volcanologist at the Montserrat Volcano
Observatory.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, only the northern third of the island -- blocked from
the volcano by huge hills -- is said to be safe.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the island's remaining 4,500 or so residents have
been crammed into an arid, 10-square-mile region, marked by steep
land and corkscrew roads.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the volcano, the 12,000 residents of this island,
only 11 miles long and 7 miles wide, had little room to maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   After the volcano erupted, two-thirds of the island's population
were evacuated to Great Britain or to other Caribbean islands.
</P>
<P>
   The volcano was a double-whammy for Montserratians still reeling
from the wrath of Hurricane Hugo, which ripped across the island in
1989 with winds of up to 150 mph, uprooting 400-year-old trees and
damaging or destroying 95 percent of all structures.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, this will be the second near-total reconstruction of
this island in less than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the reconstruction after Hurricane Hugo was nearly
complete when the eruption took place.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   In the capital Plymouth, which had been this island's nerve
center and most-important city, the atmosphere is one of a ghost
town, where up to 10 feet of ash and rock have buried what was to
be the island's new library, hospital, and governmental buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Ash also has buried Air Studios, where a vast array of stars --
including Jimmy Buffett, Eric Clapton, Elton John, Paul McCartney,
Stevie Wonder, and the Rolling Stones -- recorded music throughout
the 1980s away from the glare of the media spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Montserratian officials operating out of trailers say they hope
to build new government offices in Little Bay, a patch of
mountainside located in the island's northern end. A laundry list
of other hoped-for projects includes a new airport and sporting
complex.
</P>
<P>
   But a lack of funds has, so far, been a stumbling block.
</P>
<P>
   British financial aid has totaled more than $100 million since
1995, but much of the assistance has been spent on ``emergency
needs,'' such as flying in tents and various equipment and setting
up the Montserrat Volcano Observatory.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, it may be months before residents are allowed
to move back into the ``danger zone,'' or the southern part of the
island, mostly because of the health risk posed by the dust.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who ventures into this region is subject to fines, even
arrest since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure no one does so, the area is dotted with big,
menacing signs that read: ``The following hazards are likely to
occur without warning -- pyroclastic flows, mud flows, and ash
falls.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also a small, central buffer zone, which is open only
during daylight hours.
</P>
<P>
   Montserrat Gov. Tony Abbott, a British official, says the island
can build a bright future, but admits it won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a top priority is drawing back Montserratians --
like the 3,500 evacuated to Britain -- many of whom had been the
island's richest and youngest residents. But about 900 people who
remain on the island still need homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This island has not only suffered from physical devastation,
but from social devastation as well,'' Abbott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each village used to look after their own, but now many of
these villages are damaged or destroyed, so there's a need to
establish places for people like the elderly and the mentally
challenged who have nowhere to go,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   He said the British government already has financed the
construction of 250 homes in the ``safe zone,'' and now plans to
implement a low-interest mortgage program.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Even before the volcano erupted, however, tourism was the
backbone of this island's economy. Businesses such as lime, sugar,
and cotton never stuck around for long.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with Plymouth evacuated, and many areas off-limits, it's
hard to entice tourists to come.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department still recommends that U.S. citizens
defer all travel to Montserrat, due to the active volcano. The
warning was even mentioned by popular talk-show hostess Oprah
Winfrey on her May 18 program, further exasperating Montserratians.
</P>
<P>
   Montserrat has always been something of a Caribbean anomaly,
escaping mass-market tourism thanks to its lack of beaches,
casinos, resorts. Even in its heyday, Montserrat never boasted more
than 150 hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Still, tourism boosters point out that before the volcano,
Montserrat attracted 30,000 visitors a year. Last year, it had
declined to about 7,000.
</P>
<P>
   Cassell, the tourism director, hopes to change all that. She
sees the volcano as the island's ticket out of the economic
doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly 4 million people visit Hawaii each year just to see the
volcano, so our volcano can be an attraction as well,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But there are currently no hotel accommodations here, although
tourists can pay to stay in people's homes. A new 18-room hotel,
called Tropical Mansions, is set to open by November, while the Vue
Pointe, the island's biggest hotel before the eruption with 44
rooms, is scheduled to re-open by December.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the 110-passenger Caledonian Star became the first
cruise ship to visit the island since the volcano erupted. Its
passengers were able to get an up-close look at the volcano, as
well as see firsthand the devastation it left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to fight for funds from the British government
so we can make improvements to our port so that more cruise ships
can come,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Arthurton, who owns Carib-World Travel in Antigua, with
another office in Baltimore, said she too has started marketing the
volcano.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to develop adventure tours that include visits to
the volcano because it's my belief that one person's disaster can
be another person's attraction,'' she said.

BANK FORECAST SEES GOOD YEAR FOR FARMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOBBY McGILL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Following a less than fruitful 1998 season,
California farmers can look forward to a more profitable crop in
1999, according to a survey conducted by the Bank of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``If production conditions prove favorable for the remainder of
1999, the value of the state's final agricultural output and net
farm income should rise,'' Vernon Crowder, an agricultural
economist at the Bank of America, said in a statement accompanying
the release Monday of the bank's 1999 Agricultural Outlook report.
</P>
<P>
   The study also foresees a good year for dairies, which should
benefit from low feed costs. Increased demand for California
products in the previously depressed markets of Asia also bodes
well for the state's farmers, according to the bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be a good year,'' said Marilyn Watkins, a
spokeswoman for the California Tree Fruit Agreement in Reedley,
which represents about 2,000 California growers.
</P>
<P>
   The optimism is welcome after a poor year for the state's
agribusiness industry. In 1998, according to the Bank of America
report, lower market prices and lower yields because of heavy rains
reduced net farm income by 43 percent to $3.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The report found the cotton industry was hit hardest by last
year's downturn. The drop in net income for this industry, as well
as others, was due in part to weak global markets. Just the same,
Mother Nature gets a big chunk of the blame.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins agreed with the Bank of America assessment: ``The main
problem last season had to do with the weather.''
</P>
<P>
   The bank remains bullish on farming, despite more harsh weather
this season _ primarily lower temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Freezing December temperatures in the San Joaquin Valley damaged
more than 80 percent of the citrus crop, according to the report.
Stormy, cold weather in March and April also reduced the yield for
numerous grape, vegetable, tree fruit and nut crops.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the overall damage to the harvest has been
moderate, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the weather that was so bad for citrus trees was
actually a boon for other fruit trees, particularly peaches,
nectarines and plums.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cold weather in the winter actually has a good effect on our
fruit. It gives it good flavor,'' Watkins said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of America report focuses solely on the financial
outlook of agribusiness and means little to consumers, Watkins
said. She said prices should be about the same as they were last
year.

   MOVIE: President Clinton today won pledges from thousands of
movie theaters to require photo identification from young people
seeking admission to R-rated movies. Clinton had challenged the
industry to enforce the rating system more strictly in the wake of
the high school shootings in Littleton, Colo. In response, the
National Association of Theater Owners said it would adopt a new
policy requiring youths unaccompanied by adults to produce a photo
ID before being admitted to R-rated films. The association
represents about 20,000 screens _ 65 percent of the motion picture
screens in the United States. We'll talk to kids, parents and other
experts _ including AMC Theaters _ about whether they think this
will really work and whether it can be enforced. Donald Bradley.

ADVICE FOR 20-SOMETHINGS: INVEST EARLY AND WISELY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For 20-somethings who haven't yet sprained their
brains on matters financial, here's some beginner's advice from
financial adviser and author Daniel Goldie: Forget that sizzling
start-up company or initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Most starry-eyed young investors hear of the occasional
high-tech worker who strikes it rich. They don't hear about the
many horror stories, the bankruptcies, the financial failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good analogy is my tennis career,'' said Goldie, a senior
financial adviser for RWB Securities Inc. in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're sports fans, they may know about me, but they
rarely hear about the thousands of tennis players who never made it
to the college or professional level.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldie, who is co-author of ``The Prudent Investor's Guide to
Beating Wall Street at Its Own Game'' (McGraw-Hill), learned his
money lessons the hard way. He grew up in McLean, Va., where his
parents divorced when he was 13, and he and his bookkeeper mother
stretched to live on one salary.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, at Stanford University, Goldie developed into
a world-class tennis player. He was the National Collegiate
Athletic Association singles men's champion in 1986, then turned
pro, made the Wimbledon quarterfinals and earned a No. 27 world
ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Flush with cash at an early age, Goldie was forced to make tough
decisions. Dive into spending sprees and flirt with bankruptcy like
many young pro athletes? Or buckle down and invest in his future?
He chose the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had a high-spending lifestyle _ I learned early on
to keep my expenses down,'' said Goldie, 35, who lives on the
Peninsula with his wife and two young boys. ``The returns on my
money have been great.''
</P>
<P>
   He offers this advice to younger people:
</P>
<P>
   _ Start saving early for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Delayed gratification pays off. Those who commit money early for
retirement _ even if it's 50 years away _ will be grinning when
they hit their golden years.
</P>
<P>
   At a 10 percent annual return, if you start saving $5,000 a year
at age 25, you'll have $2.2 million when you retire at 65. Start at
35, and you'll accrue $822,000. Start at 45, and you'll end up with
only $286,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year you delay, it costs you a lot of money,'' Goldie
said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Learn to invest wisely.
</P>
<P>
   Too many young people invest based on hot tips from financial
gurus. Or they trade like mad, trying to time the market. Or they
imagine themselves to be the next high-tech employee who cashes out
big on stock options.
</P>
<P>
   Goldie said they need to return to the foundations of investing.
Among other principles, that includes balancing their portfolios,
carefully choosing mutual funds and understanding risk vs. returns.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tone down those high expectations of the bull market and
diversify your portfolio to reduce risk.
</P>
<P>
   Many giddy 20-somethings and young baby boomers have experienced
only the raging bull market. Sooner or later, a bear market will
hit, Goldie said.
</P>
<P>
   During good or bad times, it pays to balance one's portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Look at one of Goldie's former clients, a Silicon Valley manager
who owned hundreds of shares in a sizzling software company. The
stock had a great run, earning 20 to 30 percent returns over
several years.
</P>
<P>
   Goldie strongly recommended that the young man sell some of
those holdings and spread out the risk among other strong stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The man ignored the advice. A few weeks later, the software
company's stock got crushed, plunging 70 percent. The man lost more
than $1 million, Goldie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't understand the difference between
investment strategies that make them enormous wealth _ and
investment strategies that keep their wealth for them,'' Goldie
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A heavily concentrated position in a high-growth stock makes
their wealth,'' he said. ``But if they want to keep their wealth,
they need a well-diversified portfolio. To keep their wealth, they
need to reduce their risk.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Save for home-buying.
</P>
<P>
   Even party-hardy 20-somethings will want to start a family and
buy a home one day, Goldie said. That time will come sooner than
they think.
</P>
<P>
   After putting money into retirement vehicles such as
tax-sheltered 401(k)s, 403(b)s and IRAs, they should save up to 10
percent of their paychecks for a big house down payment. That money
should sit in a short-term bond fund or other safe place, Goldie
said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Buy disability insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Many young people carry health, auto and life insurance, but few
look at disability insurance, Goldie said. A young worker's
greatest asset is his or her earning power over the next 40 years.
A good disability package _ covering, say, 70 percent of those
wages _ will protect that asset if he or she is unable to work.
</P>
<P>
   Private disability insurance goes far beyond the meager payments
from the state workers' compensation program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine if you're hurt at work and you lose all of your
income,'' Goldie said. ``For a young person, injury is the highest
risk _ not death.''

REDISTRICTING MEANS END OF BIPARTISANSHIP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush was hugging Democratic and
Republican lawmakers alike on the closing day of the Texas
legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   He knew each side had contributed significantly to tax cuts,
teacher pay raises and other successes that he will largely claim
as his own when he finally takes his presidential campaign out of
state this week.
</P>
<P>
   The large tent on Bush's front lawn, where he hosted a fajita
luncheon for legislators, was clearly big enough for both parties.
</P>
<P>
   But there were clouds on the horizon that portended a much
stormier session for lawmakers the next time they get together _ in
2001 _ with or without Bush.
</P>
<P>
   While the Republican governor was praising the virtues of
bipartisanship, leaders of the Republican and Democratic parties
were tearing it down.
</P>
<P>
   The different reactions were not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Bush needed the help of Democrats to get most of his program
through the Legislature. And although he will be running for the
nation's highest office in a partisan election system, he will
welcome _ and receive _ the support of many Democrats in his quest
for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of political parties, meanwhile, have much simpler and
easier jobs. They don't have to govern. They just have to be
partisan. And not to disappoint the expectations of their
followers, Texas Democratic Chairwoman Molly Beth Malcolm and her
Republican counterpart, Susan Weddington, fired broadsides.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm said that Democratic legislators, not the governor, were
the true leaders, and Weddington issued a six-page statement
extolling the virtues of Republican leadership and bemoaning the
fact that GOP lawmakers had to share the statehouse _ or the
planet, for that matter _ with Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's praise of bipartisanship notwithstanding, next year's
legislative races may be more contentious than ever, and the 2001
session may spatter political blood all over the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   While the just-completed legislative session was dominated by
Bush's presidential race, the next session and the legislative
elections leading up to it will be dominated by that most partisan
of all legislative endeavors, redistricting.
</P>
<P>
   During the 2001 session, the Legislature will have the task of
redrawing legislative and congressional district boundaries to
reflect changing population patterns determined by the 2000 federal
census.
</P>
<P>
   The new legislative district lines will be particularly
important because they will help determine the partisan makeup of
the Legislature for the next decade and perhaps longer. That's why
Republicans and Democrats both attach a lot of importance to the
partisan affiliation of the lawmakers who draw the lines.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have never had in modern times a majority of either
the Texas House or the state Senate during a redistricting session,
which normally occurs every 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans now have a 16-15 majority in the Senate, but at
least two Senate seats _ and maybe more _ will likely be highly
contested next year. Democrats are expected to make a strong run at
the seat held by Sen. Drew Nixon, R-Carthage, and Republicans are
expected to mount a strong challenge of Sen. David Cain, D-Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to erase a political liability, Weddington last week took
the unusual step of publicly urging Nixon _ a member of her own
party _ not to seek re-election. Nixon served time in jail a couple
of years ago for illegally carrying a handgun after he was arrested
in a prostitution sting in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the election year action will be focused on the House,
where Republicans once again will try to capture a majority. They
have been inching closer in recent elections, but Democrats still
hold a 78-72 edge.
</P>
<P>
   If they were to capture a House majority next year, Republicans
also would try to elect one of their own speaker in 2001 _ if they
could agree on a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   It's way too early, obviously, to predict how the 2001
redistricting effort _ with or without a Republican House majority
_ will turn out.
</P>
<P>
   If partisanship keeps the Legislature from finishing the job,
the Republicans would have the upper hand. Last year's GOP sweep of
statewide offices gave Republicans a majority of the Legislative
Redistricting Board, which would draw the lines if lawmakers don't.
</P>
<P>
   It's not too early, however, to predict that the redistricting
process will be contentious _ and very partisan. It also may prove
to be so distracting that it will be extremely difficult to pass
other major legislation.
</P>
<P>
   If so, Bush, if he is still here, or Gov. Rick Perry may be
hosting a food fight, rather than a bipartisan luncheon, at
session's end.
</P>

WALKING IRIS PLANT MAKES ATTRACTIVE BASKET SUBJECT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I have an unusual plant that looks like a spider or airplane
plant. It has done well in its basket. It has long runners with
baby spiders but, to my surprise, these babies have flowers
April-May. The blooms have three large white petals with three
small curled violet petals in the center. There are tan markings
near the base of the petals. I was told it could be a walking iris.
What say you?
</P>
<P>
   A: I say walking iris, ``Neomarcia gracilis,'' an evergreen iris
relative that matures to a height of about 2 feet. The glossy green
fans are attractive, especially when the plants are allowed to mass
in a flower bed. But as you see, this plant makes an attractive
basket subject.
</P>
<P>
   The flowers are 2 inches wide and are white with yellow and
brown markings and blotched blue. As each bloom fades, a plantlet
forms, and as this grows larger and therefore heavier, the stalk
bends until the plantlet reaches the ground and roots: therefore,
the name walking iris.
</P>
<P>
   This perennial thrives in filtered or partial sun and prefers
water while growing. Protect from freezing temperatures with a
layer of mulch. The top may burn back during harsh cold, but the
roots are usually hardy.
</P>
<P>
   This is an easy-to-care-for plant that is fun to share with
friends.
</P>
<P>
   There is another iris in this genus, Neomarica longifolia, that
is equally easy. While the plant produces plantlets where blooms
fade, the stalks do not bend, so the plant does not walk. However,
new fans will pop up near the mother plant over time, and, of
course, you can remove the plantlets, as you would a daylily pip,
and plant them.
</P>
<P>
   The late spring through summer blooms on this evergreen are
yellow and mottled with brown.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I planted three climbing roses this spring. They are growing
vigorously, but are not producing any buds. The tag says they
should produce in the first season. Also, something is eating
nickel-size holes in the leaves. Any ideas as to what this could
be?
</P>
<P>
   A: Climbing roses can take a while longer than shrub roses to
bloom. However, too much nitrogen can sometimes cause overly
vigorous growth at the expense of blooms. Since your plants are
growing well, just try to be patient. (I assume your roses are
repeat bloomers, rather than only in spring.)
</P>
<P>
   If those holes are circular and at the edges of the leaves, I
bet leafcutting bees are at work. The bees use the leaf parts in
their nests. These insects are important pollinators, and I've
found do only cosmetic damage to the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have a Norfolk Island pine purchased several years ago as
a living Christmas tree. It is now quite large and too heavy to
move frequently. Is it possible to transplant this potted tree into
our garden to preserve it as an outdoor specimen?
</P>
<P>
   A: In their native habitats, Norfolks can reach 50 feet. Here we
find a Norfolk will eventually outgrow its use as a house plant,
and we're faced with finding it a home in a building with an atrium
or moving it to the patio, where it is subject to freeze damage in
winter. Generous layering of blankets will help during a hard
freeze, but the plant may suffer damage.
</P>
<P>
   You could plant your tree in the garden, but when there is harsh
cold, you would need to take extra precautions to protect it.
</P>
<P>
   Many try to prune too-tall Norfolks, but in doing so, ruin the
natural shape. Rather than top it in such a manner, you can take a
foot or foot and a half off the top and root this cutting to
produce a new plant. While this still results in a rather misshapen
plant, it may not look quite as bad. The top cutting should include
two tiers of lateral branches. Remove the bottom branches before
planting the cutting.

GORE CLASHES WITH SOME SENATE DEMOCRATS ON SOCIAL SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By J.T. YOUNG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two ships passed in the night recently.
</P>
<P>
   One carried Senate Democrats under the white flag of
bipartisanship. Their mission: to plead with the White House not to
force their constituents employed by state and local governments
into the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   The other ship carried Vice President Gore under the skull and
crossbones of demagoguery. His mission: continued attack on
Republicans who dare even to talk seriously about Social Security
reform.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this ironic is that the Senate Democrats are asking
the president to do precisely what the vice president is attacking
Republicans for suggesting: allowing individuals to hold their
government retirement funds in private accounts.
</P>
<P>
   On April 22, 1999, 12 Senators from both parties signed a letter
to President Clinton asking that five million of their constituents
_ those employed by state and local governments and covered by
other pension plans _ continue to be excluded from Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Five of 12 are of the president's party _ Senators Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., Christopher Dodd,
D-Conn., Richard J. Durbin, D-Ill., and Ted Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Their concern is that the White House, in putting together a
Social Security reform proposal, might follow the recommendations
of the President's Advisory Council on Social Security to force
these employees into the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   As the senators accurately point out, these employees were
originally excluded under the 1935 Social Security Act, primarily
because many state and local employees already were protected by
public pension plans.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments by the 12 senators give great insight into Social
Security and its need for reform. What is most telling is their
warning of the adverse impact on the employees themselves: they
would lose out on both flexibility and higher rates of return if
brought under the Social Security program.
</P>
<P>
   First, let's look at the senators' concern over the loss of
flexibility to state and local employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventy-nine percent of police and firefighter disabilities
are partial disabilities that do not prohibit the individual from
taking a less physically-demanding job. Public pensions typically
award partial benefits to the partially disabled. Social Security
provides benefits only when the individual becomes totally
unemployable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Furthermore, the nature of police and firefighter work often
requires early retirement, which under Social Security is not
available until age 62.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, the Senators note that their constituents ``will receive
higher retirement benefits from their current public pensions than
they would under Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it would be hard not to do so.
</P>
<P>
   City of San Diego employees, for example, are required to
contribute at least 3 percent of their salaries (and may contribute
up to 7.5 percent) to a defined contribution plan that invests in
four mutual funds as well as lower-risk securities. Some 85 percent
of the city's employees choose to contribute more than the minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Let's take a look at this real-life example of return rates, and
then compare that with returns under Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Assume a 26-year-old employee chooses to contribute just 3.1
percent (half of the employee's 6.2 percent share of the payroll
tax, which is matched by the employer's 6.2 percent share) of her
constant $32,000 salary to the defined-contribution plan.
</P>
<P>
   If this money is put into a stock fund that simply matched the
average 7 percent real rate of growth in the stock market over this
century, she will have accumulated $293,385 in constant dollars in
an account she controls after 45 years. Not bad.
</P>
<P>
   Compare that with the current Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   After 45 years, based on her projected retirement pay-out rate
from the government, she will effectively reap a maximum of 2.57
percent return on her contributions and those of her employer _
just over one-third as much as the historical rate of return from
the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, how much she actually sees will depend on how long
she lives. It would take 24.2 years for her to recover all her
contribution plus interest.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the vice president attacked Republicans who dared
speak of serious Social Security reform for ``putting politics
first'' and charged that Republicans were ``talking about
privatizing this and privatizing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the choice of privately-held accounts _ which Gore seeks to
demagogue as ``privatizing'' _ are no more than what San Diego city
employees now have and what five Democratic Senators (including
both from California) petitioned the White House to protect.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 senators are right in speaking up for their state and
local workers. Why should they have to switch from a system that
take less from their paychecks (just 3 percent in the case of San
Diego city employees versus 6.2 percent under Social Security),
returns more at retirement, and provides more flexibility at all
points in between? Of course, it begs the larger question:
Shouldn't all Americans be allowed such a deal?
</P>
<P>
   It is obviously not a question that the White House and the vice
president want asked, let alone answered.
</P>

DOCTORS FIND A DOSE MEDITATION MAY HELP HEART PATIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NISKAYUNA, N.Y. _ Every afternoon, Edward Koch sits in a chair
in his home and meditates.
</P>
<P>
   He had a heart attack in 1994 and health specialists at Kaiser
Permanente encouraged him to improve his diet, exercise and
meditate to help with his recovery program.
</P>
<P>
   Of all those lifestyle changes, meditating proved to be the most
simple yet the most challenging for Koch, then a 64-year-old
researcher for the General Electric Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``You say, `Am I doing it right? Am I leaving something out? Why
aren't I levitating off the ground?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Koch has yet to levitate but through daily meditation he has
experienced a sense of peace and inner strength against the
distractions and stresses of daily life.
</P>
<P>
   ``In traffic, I didn't have that urgency or road rage. My wife
seemed to notice I was a lot calmer. I think it's helped me fight
this heart disease,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A growing body of research shows that meditation does just that,
by reducing heart rate and blood pressure, improving immune
function and decreasing stress-hormone levels.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Dr. Dean Ornish's Program for Reversing Heart Disease,''
meditation is given the same importance for improving heart health
as diet and exercise.
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 panel at the National Institutes of Health found ``strong
evidence'' that meditation and other relaxation techniques are
effective at treating a variety of chronic conditions, from heart
disease to migraines, lower-back pain and arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any form of stress management is helpful,'' said Dr. David
Armenia, the medical director of Cardiac Rehabilitation and the
Intensive Care Unit at Ellis Hospital in Schenectady. ``The problem
is that getting most people to do something like that is
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are plenty of reasons not to try it: time constraints,
skepticism and boredom at the idea of sitting still.
</P>
<P>
   Koch was one of those skeptics. When he first started
meditating, he felt fidgety and his mind jumped around, flitting
from thought to thought. ``At first, I didn't think too much of it
... but I did it because it was part of the program.,'' he said.
``I look forward to it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephan Bodian, a longtime practitioner and teacher of
meditation and the author of a new book, ``Meditation for
Dummies,'' tells his students not to worry about that initial
restlessness.
</P>
<P>
   Meditation takes practice and it's the process of practicing
that makes it so helpful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to know that there's really no wrong way to
meditate,'' Bodian said from his office in Marin County, Calif.
``It's to make a shift from thinking and planning to just being.''
</P>
<P>
   As he points out in his book, we let our minds stress us out by
replaying negative conversations, hashing over worrisome scenarios
and creating inner dramas based on events of the past or the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Such constant mind chatter not only raises the level of stress
hormones in the body, but also distracts us from enjoying the
present moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through the regular practice of meditation, you can reduce
your suffering and stress by stilling and ultimately dissipating
the confusion and turbulence inside you,'' Bodian writes in his
book.
</P>
<P>
   ``As one Zen master put it, `If your mind isn't clouded by
unnecessary things, this moment is the best moment of your life.'''
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be a Buddhist, or a subscriber to any kind of
thought system, to appreciate that insight. Nor do you need any
fancy equipment, tapes or the ability to sit cross-legged on the
floor to meditate. ``I just sit in a chair and repeat, `Relax, let
go,' and I kind of form a visual picture in my mind of somebody
cutting a rope with knots in it. That's the tension letting go,''
Koch said.
</P>

   As Bodian points are, there are dozens of ways to meditate.
Count your breaths, focus on an image, whatever you feel
comfortable doing. Start with five minutes and gradually increase
your time. If you feel your mind wandering, return your focus to
your breathing.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how you do it, remember the most important step is the
doing: ``Don't get stressed out about it,'' Bodian said.

COLLEGE PROGRAM TO FOCUS ON ARCHITECTURAL RENOVATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute hopes to draw on
the rich architecture of New York's capital region _ from the Dutch
colonial influences to the marble megaliths of the Empire State
Plaza _ with a new degree program in architectural renovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Northeast, we are built out,'' said Alan Balfour, dean
of RPI's school of architecture. ``We're increasingly focused on
maintaining what we have.''
</P>
<P>
   The new program, to begin this fall, is emblematic of a national
trend. In 1996, the American Institute of Architects projected that
a few years into the new millennium, building rehabilitation will
overtake new construction as a percentage of the total construction
projects in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Mirrored on RPI's successful Executive MBA Program, the Master
of Science in Building Conservation is geared toward working
professionals. Courses will be offered on weekends. Students and
their families will be encouraged to commune at a nearby hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows access to this discipline for people who can't
afford to quit their job for two years while they get a master's,''
said Michael Lynch, vice president of the Society for the
Preservation of New England Antiquities in Boston and a member of
the advisory committee for the new program.
</P>
<P>
   The degree is currently slated as a pilot, pending approval by
the state Department of Education. Seven students are enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch described the area around Albany, the state capital, as an
ideal place to launch such a project, with its rich architectural
choices.
</P>
<P>
   What few realize, he added, is that the area is also home to
some of the nation's premier preservationists _ architects like
John Waite, who handled the renovation of the Lincoln Memorial and
the homes of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Almost unheard of three decades ago, historic preservation as a
distinct architectural specialty grew out of the excesses wrought
by urban renewal and the massive expansion of the highway system in
the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   While much of urban America underwent an economic development
boom at the time, the Albany area lagged behind. This was bad news
for almost everyone but historic preservationists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting irony: Poverty is the best preservation
tool,'' said Lynch, who until recently was a senior preservation
coordinator with the state of New York. ``Albany never seemed to
get the economic development pressure that cities like Boston and
Philadelphia got. Yeah, we got urban renewal. But we still have
hundreds, thousands of wonderful, old buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the science of renovation, students in the RPI
program will learn preservation law and how to apply for grants. In
New York alone, more than $8 million is available through the
preservation grants system.
</P>
<P>
   Preserving the past takes time. Waite said that one of his
projects, a British army barracks in Trenton, N.J., took more than
20 years to fund and restore.
</P>
<P>
   But he believes that's the direction his profession is headed.
``There is a huge emphasis on restoring existing buildings right
now,'' he said. ``The field of architecture has turned upside
down.''

   KOSOVO-KLA _ TIRANA, Albania _ The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army,
which has been fighting Serb troops inside Kosovo province, said
Tuesday that it will abide by NATO orders to stop shooting Serbs.
The KLA also said the Serbs have used chemical weapons in recent
days and claim Serbs are hauling truckloads of Kosovar Albanian
bodies for reburial and cremation. They have photos and witnesses
and are turning info over to the Yugolsav War Crimes Tribunal at
The Hague. Developing. (Roughton, Cox News Service). 20. WITH

   SERB-REFUGEES _ The bombing in Serbia and Kosovo has strained an
already edgy situation in nearby Bosnia-Herzegovina. 20,000
Kosovars are seeking refuge in and around Sarajevo being housed in
accomodations ranging from rustic U.N. camps to their own hastily
rented apartments. Thousands of Serb refugees are crowding into the
nearby Republika Srpska _ the ethnic Serbian-half of Bosnia _
having fled Serbia from the bombing or still homeless after being
driven out of Croatia over the last five years. (Bebbington, Dayton

</P>
<P>
   GUNDEAL _ WASHINGTON _ One percent of the nation's gun dealers
sold nearly half of the guns used in crime last year and many of
those businesses show up year after year as major sources of crime
weapons, according to a new study of federal firearms data. The
study conducted by the office of Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y.,
marks a new phase of a growing effort to hold firearms dealers
responsible for gun violence. Georgia ranks high on the list as a
supplier of guns used in crime. (Foskett, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   GUNS-VIOLENCE _ WASHINGTON _ IOLENCE _ WASHINGTON_ House
Republican leaders decide not to send juvenile crime bill to Henry
Hyde's House Judiciary Committee tomorrow, but to send it directly
to the House floor next week. The legislation would restrict youth
access to video games, movies and other items containing violent
and sexually explicit material and would require the music industry
to provide stores with copies of song lyrics as a means of allowing
adults to keep questionable products from their children. (Foskett,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   CHILD-CARE _ WASHINGTON _ Child care advocates say that a report

BEAN COUNTERS MAY GET NEW ORDER: ORGANIC COFFEE ONLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SELNA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ One of life's simple pleasures may soon
become increasingly complex.
</P>
<P>
   If Berkeley Mayor Shirley Dean has her way, city departments
will be required to buy only organic coffee produced under fair
trade conditions. Previous Berkeley initiatives prevent the city
from buying Salvadoran coffee beans or serving beverages in
Styrofoam cups.
</P>
<P>
   But Dean, who admits her proposal is largely symbolic because of
the small amount of coffee the city actually buys, said the new
restrictions wouldn't inconvenience employees and might help
preserve the environment and improve conditions for coffee growers
in developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Berkeley people are really passionate about coffee, and
organic coffee is gourmet and also allows people to do something
for the environment that is socially responsible,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certified organic'' coffee beans, according to Dean's office,
are grown without heavy use of pesticides and other chemicals,
certified as such by a third party. ``Shade'' organic coffee has
the additional benefit of being grown in the shade of taller jungle
trees, thereby preserving forests and bird habitats.
</P>
<P>
   Organic coffee has been widely available since the early 1990s,
but still makes up only about 5 percent of the gourmet coffee and 1
percent of all coffee sales in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it still only makes up a small percentage of the coffee
sold, organic coffee is the fastest growing segment of the coffee
market and is growing by about 18 to 20 percent a year,'' said Dave
Griswold, owner of the organic coffee bean wholesaler Sustainable
Harvest in Emeryville.
</P>
<P>
   Fair-trade coffee, Griswold said, are beans for which growers
are guaranteed a certain price regardless of the sometimes volatile
swing of the coffee commodities market. The theory goes that
because prices are guaranteed, workers are typically assured of
receiving a living wage.
</P>
<P>
   As in manufacturing athletic shoes and other clothing, Griswold
said, producing coffee beans is an endeavor in which unskilled
workers in developing countries often receive a disproportionately
small share of the profits.
</P>
<P>
   Dean, who said she drinks six to 10 cups of coffee a day, said
she had gotten the idea for the purchasing restriction from the
longtime West Berkeley wholesale coffee distributor Uncommon
Grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been selling organic and conventional coffee
since 1984, but has seen the demand for organic jump in the past
few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like wine in California in the '60s,'' said Uncommon
Grounds general manger Kim Moore. ``To most people it was just red
or white and came in a big jug, but then people got smart about it
_ that's what's happened with coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   Berkeley Finance Director Fran David said the city typically
spends about $6,000 a year on coffee.
</P>
<P>
   David said there was no citywide coffee buying policy, and most
departments handled it on their own. However, she said similar
policies have been implemented in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have restrictions against Salvadoran beans, virgin redwood,
companies that do business with Nigeria, Burma and Tibet, and any
company engaged with the nuclear industry, including IBM and
Motorola,'' David said.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget Styrofoam cups.

 &HT;    
 By JAMES BENNET  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    On the windy Friday in February that the Senate acquitted her
husband of perjury and obstruction of justice, Hillary Rodham
Clinton turned her attention to her life after his presidency.
 &HT;    From before the first vote that day until long after the last,
she met with her friend Harold Ickes on the second floor of the
White House, in the family quarters, to weigh whether for the first
time to promote herself rather than Bill Clinton for public office.
 &HT;    Hillary Clinton felt flattered that Democrats were begging her
to run for the Senate from New York, an idea she had laughed off
when Rep. Charles Rangel, the mischievous Manhattan Democrat, first
suggested it in a Chicago church last October.
 &HT;    She was delighted with the shift under way in her public image,
from passive victim to political heavyweight. After all her policy
work and speechifying, it had galled her to watch her popularity
spike upward in the past year as she turned her lapidary smile to
the world and suffered through the revelations of her husband's
affair with that woman.
 &HT;    Now, for four hours, as she and Ickes _ a scarred veteran of New
York politics and a former aide to her husband _ moved from the
living room to lunch in the family dining room and back to the
living room, she plumbed the risks of a race for the Senate seat
that Daniel Patrick Moynihan had decided to vacate.
 &HT;    Would she really want to be one of a hundred senators? Could she
survive a street fight with a nasty opponent? Could she stand the
pawing of New York City's feral reporters?
 &HT;    The backing and forthing with Ickes had fitting precedent. Half
a century ago, a woman Clinton regards as a role model, Eleanor
Roosevelt, mulled running for the Senate from New York at the
prompting of a former adviser to her husband. He was also named
Harold Ickes; he was the father of Hillary Clinton's friend.
 &HT;    But like so many parallels between the century's two most
compelling first ladies, this one illuminates as many differences
as similarities. Hillary had summoned her Harold, while Eleanor was
importuned by hers. Pulled between her lofty aims and her cautious
nature, Hillary was embarking on months of painstaking cogitation,
while Eleanor almost immediately turned her Harold down.
 &HT;    ``I feel very strongly that running for office is not the way in
which I can be most useful,'' she wrote him on May 26, 1945, just
days after he raised the idea. She did not want to burden her
children with another office-holding parent. She also did not want
to burden herself with having to follow what she called ``the party
line.''
 &HT;    ``I hope to continue to work with the Democrats and for them,''
Eleanor continued briskly, ``but I think the knowledge that I will
be free of any obligation may at times be very healthy.''
 &HT;    ``Free of any obligation'' _ it is an expression lustrous with
meaning for political spouses, and particularly for first ladies of
the United States. Since Martha Washington likened herself to a
state prisoner, first ladies have felt oppressed by arranging
flowers or delivering speeches, by wielding influence or not enough
of it, by the private compromises and the planetary humiliations.
 &HT;    Eleanor Roosevelt feared continued limitation in winning office
for herself. Hillary Clinton glimpses freedom, or so her friends
and advisers say _ freedom to participate in politics fully, with
her own constituents, on her own terms, for her own purposes.
 &HT;    Hillary Clinton is about to become a liberated woman. Come
January 2001, for the first time since she moved to Arkansas as a
26-year-old lawyer in 1974, she will be able to walk her own path
regardless of her husband's political career. While most people
provided such an opening might be fantasizing about anonymity and a
long break, Clinton is methodically exploring her options for
staying in the spotlight.
 &HT;    If she does not pull out of the New York race in June, she is
likely to announce an exploratory committee in July, knowing that
that will be regarded as throwing her hat in the ring. With that
announcement, the Clintons would neatly reverse roles, at least
regarding New York. She would step forward to present herself as a
leader, while he would be relegated to behind-the-scenes,
supporting chores.
 &HT;    To be sure, since she graduated from Yale Law School and opted
for Bill Clinton and Arkansas, it has become unremarkable for women
to compete for higher office.
 &HT;    As she pondered the Senate race, Clinton was standing in the way
of another woman, Rep. Nita Lowey of Westchester County, and an
older but far less traditional political spouse, Elizabeth Dole,
was running for president.
 &HT;    Clinton's race would be path-breaking, but only because she
would be undertaking it while her husband was still in office. In
that sense, it would certainly be pioneering for Clinton and for
first ladies, but not for women generally. She is too late for
that.
 &HT;    But so what? Clinton did not sacrifice her ambition to her
husband's so much as yoke them together. As a result of that
decision, it has been her fate to be judged more for how she has
stood by her man than for what she has accomplished with him and
more for what she represents as a woman than for what she has done
as first lady.
 &HT;    As it happens, she has done quite a bit. And the flip side of
the loyal role she has played is that she regards his
accomplishments as hers too. When she was saving his presidency
last year _ condemning unnamed conspirators and then sticking with
him after he admitted they were right about his affair _ she was
also saving her own.
 &HT;    By now, Hillary Clinton is operating under the presumption that
she will run for the Senate, and she is looking for a house in
Westchester County. Her goals remain rather vague, but her ambition
for service and confidence in herself remain intact and vaulting.
It is just that Bill Clinton is no longer the best vehicle.
 &HT;    But that does not mean that she will run, and that points up
another difference between the Clintons. When it comes to politics,
he works from the gut as well as from his beloved polls, while she
is more cerebral. The risks and challenges of a race excite him.
They scare her. This is a defining life decision for her, perhaps
the biggest she has made since her marriage, and in the end she may
decide not to gamble her popularity and political clout.
 &HT;    She does not want to lose. Horse-race polls don't mean much now,
but the ones that showed her running away with victory have been
replaced by others showing at best that she might squeak by
Giuliani. And some of her advisers are more worried about a
possible challenge from Rep. Rick Lazio, the Long Island
Republican, or even Gov. George Pataki.
 &HT;    ``One of the lures of being senator is you're out on your own,''
one of her advisers told me. ''One of the liabilities is you lose
on your own.''
 &HT;    Paradoxically, Clinton's record in her husband's office is
clearest where it is least relevant to the voters who might elect
her. Far more than in the United States, Hillary Clinton has found
her own voice overseas. She has spent more days this year in North
Africa than in New York. And abroad, she conducts a sort of shadow
presidency, with advisers borrowed from assorted agencies and an
aging 707 whose port engine periodically bursts into flames.
 &HT;    She does it with what amounts to her own foreign policy,
promoting issues of women's rights, health care and development
that her husband addresses rarely, and almost always with her at
his side. In her speeches abroad, she seldom even mentions the
president, not wanting to muddy her message of female empowerment
by acknowledging that her influence derives from his power.
 &HT;    Yet Clinton's passion for that role could be a problem in New
York, where it plays into what her advisers view as her chief
liability: the suspicion that she would have her eye on concerns
far from Binghamton or the Bronx. It has probably not helped her
that in her remarks about a possible race, she has tended to dwell
on why New York is big enough for her, rather than vice versa.
 &HT;    ``New York is truly a microcosm of America,'' she recently told
reporters in Manhattan. Chuck Schumer has advised Clinton that if
she decides to run, she will have to devote herself completely to
the race. ``You can't be both first lady and candidate,'' he says.
 &HT;    As first lady, she has had two luxuries that will vanish if she
presents herself as a candidate: picking and choosing what issues
she wants to address and falling back on exhortation rather than
specific proposals to solve the problems she raises.
 &HT;    Her record of passionate concern for children would surely give
her great credibility on issues like gun violence in the schools,
which after Littleton she is turning into a crusade. (``I have not
stopped thinking about it,'' she told me.)
 &HT;    When I asked her what specifically she hopes to accomplish as a
senator or citizen, she began by replying, ``Well, you know, I'm
concerned about a broad range of issues.''
 &HT;    Then she gathered speed. ``You know, much of what I care about
falls into the broad categories of creating conditions for children
to grow up and be healthy and well educated and productive
citizens. And so that means I'm interested in everything from
economic policy to education policy to adoption and foster care and
welfare policy to health care.'' She laced her fingers together as
she added, ``I think that all of these social, political, economic,
cultural issues intersect.''
 &HT;    Clinton is widely viewed as more liberal than her husband, but
there is not much evidence to support that. In Arkansas, it was
Hillary who persuaded Bill to advocate the testing of public-school
teachers. The efficacy of the test is debatable, but there is no
question it angered some of their staunchest liberal supporters.
 &HT;    ``You know, people think she's such a big lib,'' says Maggie
Williams, Clinton's former chief of staff and one of her closest
friends. ``I think she's extremely conservative. I think she has
more in common with people in upstate New York than in New York
City, in a lot of ways.'' Williams calls Clinton ``patriotic and
practical. She thinks it's important to spend money on social
programs, but she wants to know that they work.''
 &HT;    Maybe so. But until she stands on her own politically, none of
us can know.
 &HT;    After Clinton stuck by her husband through the Lewinsky scandal,
she came to present a fat target for those who found her wanting as
a feminist. And it is hard not to wince these days over some things
she says, at times so self-righteously.
 &HT;    ``We can point to many problems around our world today where
women _ for reasons of history, culture, discrimination, prejudice
_ are used to lift up patriarchy, are used really as objects in
order for others to exercise power,'' she said in commemorating
International Women's Day this year.
 &HT;    Clinton makes no apologies for her decisions last year. In the
interview, she said at first that ``people have to make their own
judgments about that,'' but then went on to suggest they had no
business doing so. A bit paradoxically, she presented her actions
as evidence of her independence and self-sufficiency.
 &HT;    ``I would hope that young women _ women of all ages _ understand
how important it is to live your own life according to your own
values,'' she said, unspooling one of those lengthy sentences
characteristic of either Clinton, ``and not be constantly looking
over your shoulder to think what anybody else is thinking about you
or saying about you, because ultimately, at the end of the day, you
have to live with yourself and you have to do what you think is
right. And again, my choices may not be someone else's choices.''
 &HT;    When it comes to the Clintons, it is hard to separate the
personal and the political. Regardless of her feelings for him,
leaving her husband last year would have brought down a presidency
she believes in to her bones.
 &HT;    Some of the Clintons' closest associates have regarded their
relationship for years as a partnership with staged shows of
affection _ ``what they had to for the moment,'' as one of them put
it to me. Even some of Hillary Clinton's friends wonder if she will
stay with him after they leave the White House.
 &HT;    But politics did not keep the Clintons together, according to
other, closer friends of Hillary. She considered leaving him last
year, they say, but her daughter and her marriage vows stopped her.
Most important, they insist, she still loves him.
 &HT;    ``She loves him, and she doesn't have to, but she does,'' one
said. Part of the reason, this friend said, is their intellectual
bond: ``Whether you think they're changing things for better or
worse, they're always going to have something to say to each other
about it.''
 &HT;    But maybe it is time to leave wondering if the Clintons truly
love each other to the historians and to focus on the
accomplishments, failures and ideas that define his presidency and
would define her Senate race.
 &HT;    If Clinton runs, she is likely to limit her husband's role,
though he will try to meddle. Indeed, it has not escaped some of
her friends that being forced onto the sidelines would be
excruciating punishment for him, as, without a campaign of his own,
he watches his wife and his vice president run.
 &HT;    But Hillary Clinton wants to find out what she can do on her
own, they say. Further, having her husband front and center would
make her look weak.
 &HT;    And therein lies a delightful switch. For years, White House
aides have praised Hillary Clinton's ability and contributions
while in the next breath minimizing her influence in order to build
up the president. Now, Hillary's allies are unself-consciously
treating her husband the same way.
 &HT;    ``She'd be a fool not to work with him very closely on this,''
one of them told me. ``It will, however, be Hillary Rodham
Clinton's campaign. It'll be her voice, and it'll be her persona. I
see him playing very much a behind-the-scenes role.''

 By JAMES BENNET  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    On the windy Friday in February that the Senate acquitted her
husband of perjury and obstruction of justice, Hillary Rodham
Clinton turned her attention to her life after his presidency.
 &HT;    From before the first vote that day until long after the last,
she met with her friend Harold Ickes on the second floor of the
White House, in the family quarters, to weigh whether for the first
time to promote herself rather than Bill Clinton for public office.
 &HT;    Hillary Clinton felt flattered that Democrats were begging her
to run for the Senate from New York, an idea she had laughed off
when Rep. Charles Rangel, the mischievous Manhattan Democrat, first
suggested it in a Chicago church last October.
 &HT;    She was delighted with the shift under way in her public image,
from passive victim to political heavyweight. After all her policy
work and speechifying, it had galled her to watch her popularity
spike upward in the past year as she turned her lapidary smile to
the world and suffered through the revelations of her husband's
affair with that woman.
 &HT;    Now, for four hours, as she and Ickes _ a scarred veteran of New
York politics and a former aide to her husband _ moved from the
living room to lunch in the family dining room and back to the
living room, she plumbed the risks of a race for the Senate seat
that Daniel Patrick Moynihan had decided to vacate.
 &HT;    Would she really want to be one of a hundred senators? Could she
survive a street fight with a nasty opponent? Could she stand the
pawing of New York City's feral reporters?
 &HT;    The backing and forthing with Ickes had fitting precedent. Half
a century ago, a woman Clinton regards as a role model, Eleanor
Roosevelt, mulled running for the Senate from New York at the
prompting of a former adviser to her husband. He was also named
Harold Ickes; he was the father of Hillary Clinton's friend.
 &HT;    But like so many parallels between the century's two most
compelling first ladies, this one illuminates as many differences
as similarities. Hillary had summoned her Harold, while Eleanor was
importuned by hers. Pulled between her lofty aims and her cautious
nature, Hillary was embarking on months of painstaking cogitation,
while Eleanor almost immediately turned her Harold down.
 &HT;    ``I feel very strongly that running for office is not the way in
which I can be most useful,'' she wrote him on May 26, 1945, just
days after he raised the idea. She did not want to burden her
children with another office-holding parent. She also did not want
to burden herself with having to follow what she called ``the party
line.''
 &HT;    ``I hope to continue to work with the Democrats and for them,''
Eleanor continued briskly, ``but I think the knowledge that I will
be free of any obligation may at times be very healthy.''
 &HT;    ``Free of any obligation'' _ it is an expression lustrous with
meaning for political spouses, and particularly for first ladies of
the United States. Since Martha Washington likened herself to a
state prisoner, first ladies have felt oppressed by arranging
flowers or delivering speeches, by wielding influence or not enough
of it, by the private compromises and the planetary humiliations.
 &HT;    Eleanor Roosevelt feared continued limitation in winning office
for herself. Hillary Clinton glimpses freedom, or so her friends
and advisers say _ freedom to participate in politics fully, with
her own constituents, on her own terms, for her own purposes.
 &HT;    Hillary Clinton is about to become a liberated woman. Come
January 2001, for the first time since she moved to Arkansas as a
26-year-old lawyer in 1974, she will be able to walk her own path
regardless of her husband's political career. While most people
provided such an opening might be fantasizing about anonymity and a
long break, Clinton is methodically exploring her options for
staying in the spotlight.
 &HT;    If she does not pull out of the New York race in June, she is
likely to announce an exploratory committee in July, knowing that
that will be regarded as throwing her hat in the ring. With that
announcement, the Clintons would neatly reverse roles, at least
regarding New York. She would step forward to present herself as a

supporting chores.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Operating room No. 5 at University Hospital in Denver is chilled
almost to the point of refrigeration, but already the team of
surgeons is sweating. The noxious scent of burning flesh fills the
air as a cauterizing instrument slices through the skin. Next comes
the snapping sound of bone, first one rib removed, then another,
until finally the target is in view.
 &HT;    ``His lung looks awful,'' says Dr. Marvin Pomerantz, one of a
small fraternity of surgeons in the world who would even attempt
this operation. ``I always hope it will be better than expected,
but it never is.''
 &HT;    The young man on the table has tuberculosis. His is a sinister
strain, resistant to all known medication, and his right lung, or
what remains of it, shows the devastation of the disease. A lung
should be pink, nestling in the chest like a delicate balloon. This
one is mottled and marbled, a red so dark it is almost black.
Beneath it, unseen, is the heart. As it beats, the lung jumps,
looking dangerous and angry.
 &HT;    The scarring from both the illness itself and the techniques
used to fight it have left the landscape of this chest cavity
scrambled beyond recognition. ``Nothing,'' Pomerantz explains, ``is
where it should be.''
 &HT;    This is less a surgery, therefore, than an excavation, as the
surgeons chip their way through the anatomical debris. The
operation began at 9 a.m.. More than two hours pass before
Pomerantz finds something familiar. ``Here's the edge of the
diaphragm,'' he says, his eyes dark with concentration over his
surgical mask. ``This is my first good landmark.''
 &HT;    The digging and snipping will go on for six hours, and Pomerantz
grows tired as he works. ``I'm a dinosaur,'' he says, and that is
exactly why he is here.
 &HT;    Medicine is supposed to march forward. Drugs, therapies,
surgical procedures _ they are all expected to become ever simpler
and more effective. That, by definition and historical precedent,
is scientific progress. But while the past decade has brought
hurtling advances, it has also brought a growing awareness that
medicine cannot always maintain its slim lead.
 &HT;    Not all that many years ago, doctors had declared victory over
infectious disease. Then the plague of AIDS appeared from nowhere
and, at the same time, bacteria that had been considered drugged
into submission mutated anew into a formidable threat.
 &HT;    ``The ancient Greeks warned of this,'' says Dr. Michael Iseman,
a pulmonologist at the National Jewish Medical and Research Center
in Denver and one of the country's leading experts on tuberculosis.
``It was hubris to believe our own press notices. We thought we
were going to conquer tuberculosis just as we thought we were going
to conquer infectious disease. But DNA wants to replicate itself,
it wants to live on and it will mutate and survive in a Darwinian
way.''
 &HT;    The same can be said of modern medicine, which is undergoing its
own unexpected counter-evolution. While still looking forward for
answers, investing in ideas that are new and untried, science is
also beginning to look back, reinvesting in ideas that have long
been abandoned. Removing all or part of a lung to stop tuberculosis
was the treatment of the 1950s.
 &HT;    Even then it was seen as a drastic and brutal approach, and by
the early 1960s a powerful generation of medications made the
surgery obsolete. Now, more than three decades later, Pomerantz
this year will perform about 30 lobectomies (partial lung removals)
and pneumonectomies (complete lung removals) on patients with
incurable microbacterial infections (a total of 350 since he began
anew in 1983).
 &HT;    ``Drugs put us out of business,'' Pomerantz says. ``Drug
resistance brought us back.''
 &HT;    Pomerantz gives his age as ``more than 60, less than Medicare.''
While he was completing his residency at Duke University Medical
Center between 1959 and 1967, TB was still a part of his training.
 &HT;    But his was the last group of surgeons to learn their trade in
the era of TB wards and sanitariums, and when surgery was later
resurrected to fight TB, Pomerantz called his own former mentor,
now a retired octogenarian, for advice. Then he tried to teach what
he remembered to a generation of young surgeons who have never
navigated their way through a TB-marred chest.
 &HT;    This return to the old ways has its notes of vindication. ``It
reminds us not to devalue the types of treatments that came
before,'' says Dr. Barron H. Lerner, a physician and medical
historian at the Columbia University College of Physicians and
Surgeons and the author of ``Contagion and Confinement,'' a history
of tuberculosis. ``Generally, people look back at these types of
procedures with disdain. They were seen as the types of things
people did when they didn't know what they were doing. But it's
really fortunate that there are people around who can still do
these operations.''
 &HT;    Pomerantz takes no satisfaction from the new premium being put
on his old skills, nor from this new awareness that medicine is not
a straight road but a looping and meandering one.
 &HT;    ``Don't think for a minute that I want to be doing this,'' he
says. ``It would be better if the drugs worked for everything _
cancer, heart disease, TB, but drugs will never be the 100 percent
answer. It's time we stop believing in a magic pill.''
 &HT;    The patient, Sonesacksith Choummanivong, is a 22-year-old
fine-arts student who is known to his family and his doctors as
Toon. The word means ``groundhog'' in Laotian, his native language,
and it became his nickname because, as an infant, he had chubby
cheeks. The moniker has stuck, a sad counterpoint to all the years
of illness that have left him gaunt and pale.
 &HT;    There is poignancy, too, in the fact that this gentle young man,
with his delicate artist's fingers, represents everything today's
infectious disease doctors fear. To them he is the personification
of contagion, the harbinger of an epidemic, the future of
tuberculosis in the United States.
 &HT;    Complacency, they remind us, led to a sharp spike in cases of TB
during the early 1990s. Vigilance then brought the numbers back
down within the country, but while Americans have been looking
inward, pleased with their progress, a new danger has arisen from
without. Last year, 40 percent of patients with tuberculosis had
come to the United States from other countries, an increase from 16
percent in 1982.
 &HT;    And therein lies the threat. The overall TB rate in New York
City is down to 21.3 per 100,000. Compare that to Bombay, where the
rate is 500 per 100,000. The crisis in Russia's prisons, in turn,
makes the Bombay statistics seem insignificant.
 &HT;    ``If you were a diabolical terrorist and you wanted to
manufacture multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, you would create an
environment and a system of care like the one in the Russian
prisons,'' says Dr. Lee B. Reichman, executive director of the New
Jersey Medical School National Tuberculosis Center.
 &HT;    He recently toured those prisons and saw, among other things,
poorly ventilated rooms where 30 prisoners shared 10 beds, sleeping
in shifts. Last year 20,000 Russian prison inmates fell ill with
strains of TB that resisted known medications. Many of those
infected inmates were then released, and they spread the disease to
15,000 civilians.
 &HT;    Some illnesses are virulent in their contagion. Put a student
with chicken pox at the front of a large lecture hall, and he
could, within minutes, infect a large percentage of the room. AIDS,
by contrast, is remarkably difficult to catch, because its
transmission requires contact with bodily fluids.
 &HT;    Tuberculosis falls somewhere in the middle. In the days before
antibiotics, doctors did experiments that included placing TB
patients in a closed room and directing air from that room into
cages filled with guinea pigs. They learned that a person must, on
average, exchange 11,000 cubic feet of air to have a 50 percent
chance of being infected. That translates into two months of
24-hour-a-day contact or six months of 8-hour-a-day contact.
 &HT;    ``Whenever there's an outbreak, reporters start calling and they
all ask, 'Can you get it on the subway?''' Reichman says. Because
the above figures are an average, he says, ``we tell them,
'Statistically, the answer is yes, you can, but it's more likely
the subway will crash.'''
 &HT;    Nevertheless, researchers estimate that each person with active
TB will go on to infect between 9 and 12 others, meaning a minimum
of 3.5 million new drug-resistant cases in Russia alone in the next
year. Now add modern transportation to this mix. ``It's tempting to
some people to talk about keeping the foreigners out,'' Reichman
says. ``Unfortunately _ or fortunately _ you can't. So we have to
confront the problem, not hide from it.''
 &HT;    Toon Choummanivong escaped from a crowded and chaotic Thai
resettlement camp in 1983, when he was 5. He, his parents and five
siblings legally settled in Holland, Mich., which is 45 minutes
south of Grand Rapids. A few years later, his father developed a
shortness of breath, night sweats and fever _ symptoms similar to
ones he'd had as a refugee in Thailand.
 &HT;    Although the family's medical history is sketchy, Toon's doctors
assume his father had been treated in Thailand with the ``first
line'' tuberculosis drugs that could once automatically cure this
disease. Because he was a penniless man in a poor country where the
health-care system was haphazard at best, he probably took those
medicines only long enough to feel better, which was not long
enough to kill all the TB bacilli in his body.
 &HT;    When he stopped taking his pills, the bugs that remained
continued to grow. Those bacilli were, by definition, the strongest
and most resistant. When he became ill again years later, in
Michigan, his disease had mutated beyond the power of the drugs. He
died in 1989.
 &HT;    Determined to live a healthy life, Toon played tennis and
soccer. He funneled his extra energies into his artwork _ bold
portraits and colorful landscapes. He ate carefully and did not
smoke or drink, even during his first semester at Dordt College in
Sioux Center, Iowa. By Christmas break in December 1995, however,
he was haggard and hacking. The symptoms were alarmingly familiar,
and they led him to Kent Community Hospital in Michigan, the same
hospital where his father died.
 &HT;    The diagnosis for Toon, too, was tuberculosis, and he was placed
in a jury-rigged isolation room for three months. Ventilation is
one low-tech but effective weapon against TB, so an unrelenting
fan, the size of a night table, was placed inches from his bed. It
ran night and day.
 &HT;    Too exhausted to tie on a mask and walk to the lounge down the
hall, he spent weeks alone, drawing with pencils in his
ever-present sketch pad. It was the dawning of the new reality of
his life _ months when no one would talk to him without hiding
behind a mask. He dared not hope for any relationship deeper than
friendship.
 &HT;    ``I've never been with anyone,'' he says. ``How can I be?'' His
life lacked even the intimacy of a smile. His portraits from that
time are striking in that they have no faces.
 &HT;    Every day he took dozens of pills _ multicapsule doses of INH,
rifampin, PZA and ethambutol. Those medications were probably the
same ones his father had taken, the ones that still cure nearly all
non-drug-resistant patients. In retrospect, his doctors now say,
they were not the best choice. Toon, they now know, did not bring
his strain of TB with him from the camps; he caught it from his
father, meaning the bugs were already resistant.
 &HT;    The medications worked well enough that within a few months Toon
felt better. The microscope, however, saw things differently. When
a sputum sample was ``cultured out,'' it grew TB bacilli, evidence
that he still harbored the disease in his lungs. The hospital sent
him home in March 1996 with a month's supply of pills. No matter
how healthy he felt, they said, he had to swallow those pills.
 &HT;    Toon had no objection to taking his medicines, because these
first-line drugs had no side effects. He also willingly observed
the restrictions on enclosed spaces _ no shopping malls or stores
or movies _ because he was reared with a respect for the rules. The
day he left the hospital, he went to the park with his brother and,
fueled by the exhilaration of being outdoors, played soccer for
three hours, until he was exhausted. He was celebrating the end of
an ordeal. He was celebrating too soon.
 &HT;    This young man lost his right lung in November. I was in the
operating room, gowned and wearing the ultraprotective mask that
resembles a duck's bill, as Pomerantz finally freed the diseased
and disfigured tissue from the chest wall and sent it off to the
pathology lab.
 &HT;    This was not my first time in an operating room, and the times I
have been lucky enough to observe surgery, I have found it
mesmerizing and beautiful. Watching a heart transplant I was awed
by the vibrant colors _ a work of art that nature never intended
for us to see _ and the moment when the donor heart was tripped to
life.
 &HT;    Choummanivong's surgery was another defining experience. It was
not beautiful; it was brutal _ hour upon hour of chipping away at
an enemy that would not surrender. The other procedures I had seen
were about giving back, replacing or fixing. This was only about
loss.
 &HT;    For several months after the final pneumonectomy,
Choummanivong's health improved. He was discharged from the
hospital before Christmas, and he weaned himself from the tanks of
oxygen that he considered such a burden. His monthly cultures were
negative for TB.
 &HT;    In late February, Toon got permission to drive with his brother
the 19 hours back to Michigan for a visit. While there, he fell ill
and thought he'd caught the flu from his young nephew. Back in
Denver, he arrived at his next appointment with an oxygen tube in
his nose, dragging the heavy canister behind him. He was shivering
and short of breath and he had dropped more than 10 pounds from his
already frail frame.
 &HT;    The next few months were agony for Choummanivong. Tests showed
he did not have the flu at all. The empty space in his right chest
had filled with TB-infected fluid. Because some surgical staples
had detached, the fluid _ with its traces of TB _ had crossed over
into his remaining lung.
 &HT;    It would take two more surgeries and an experimental new
antibiotic to control the problem. His doctors say it is still too
soon to say whether this fine young man will survive.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Operating room No. 5 at University Hospital in Denver is chilled
almost to the point of refrigeration, but already the team of
surgeons is sweating. The noxious scent of burning flesh fills the
air as a cauterizing instrument slices through the skin. Next comes
the snapping sound of bone, first one rib removed, then another,
until finally the target is in view.
 &HT;    ``His lung looks awful,'' says Dr. Marvin Pomerantz, one of a
small fraternity of surgeons in the world who would even attempt
this operation. ``I always hope it will be better than expected,
but it never is.''
 &HT;    The young man on the table has tuberculosis. His is a sinister
strain, resistant to all known medication, and his right lung, or
what remains of it, shows the devastation of the disease. A lung
should be pink, nestling in the chest like a delicate balloon. This
one is mottled and marbled, a red so dark it is almost black.
Beneath it, unseen, is the heart. As it beats, the lung jumps,
looking dangerous and angry.
 &HT;    The scarring from both the illness itself and the techniques
used to fight it have left the landscape of this chest cavity
scrambled beyond recognition. ``Nothing,'' Pomerantz explains, ``is
where it should be.''
 &HT;    This is less a surgery, therefore, than an excavation, as the
surgeons chip their way through the anatomical debris. The
operation began at 9 a.m.. More than two hours pass before
Pomerantz finds something familiar. ``Here's the edge of the
diaphragm,'' he says, his eyes dark with concentration over his
surgical mask. ``This is my first good landmark.''
 &HT;    The digging and snipping will go on for six hours, and Pomerantz
grows tired as he works. ``I'm a dinosaur,'' he says, and that is
exactly why he is here.
 &HT;    Medicine is supposed to march forward. Drugs, therapies,
surgical procedures _ they are all expected to become ever simpler
and more effective. That, by definition and historical precedent,
is scientific progress. But while the past decade has brought
hurtling advances, it has also brought a growing awareness that
medicine cannot always maintain its slim lead.
 &HT;    Not all that many years ago, doctors had declared victory over
infectious disease. Then the plague of AIDS appeared from nowhere
and, at the same time, bacteria that had been considered drugged
into submission mutated anew into a formidable threat.
 &HT;    ``The ancient Greeks warned of this,'' says Dr. Michael Iseman,
a pulmonologist at the National Jewish Medical and Research Center
in Denver and one of the country's leading experts on tuberculosis.
``It was hubris to believe our own press notices. We thought we
were going to conquer tuberculosis just as we thought we were going
to conquer infectious disease. But DNA wants to replicate itself,
it wants to live on and it will mutate and survive in a Darwinian
way.''
 &HT;    The same can be said of modern medicine, which is undergoing its
own unexpected counter-evolution. While still looking forward for
answers, investing in ideas that are new and untried, science is
also beginning to look back, reinvesting in ideas that have long
been abandoned. Removing all or part of a lung to stop tuberculosis
was the treatment of the 1950s.
 &HT;    Even then it was seen as a drastic and brutal approach, and by
the early 1960s a powerful generation of medications made the
surgery obsolete. Now, more than three decades later, Pomerantz
this year will perform about 30 lobectomies (partial lung removals)
and pneumonectomies (complete lung removals) on patients with
incurable microbacterial infections (a total of 350 since he began
anew in 1983).
 &HT;    ``Drugs put us out of business,'' Pomerantz says. ``Drug
resistance brought us back.''
 &HT;    Pomerantz gives his age as ``more than 60, less than Medicare.''
While he was completing his residency at Duke University Medical
Center between 1959 and 1967, TB was still a part of his training.
 &HT;    But his was the last group of surgeons to learn their trade in
the era of TB wards and sanitariums, and when surgery was later
resurrected to fight TB, Pomerantz called his own former mentor,
now a retired octogenarian, for advice. Then he tried to teach what
he remembered to a generation of young surgeons who have never
navigated their way through a TB-marred chest.
 &HT;    This return to the old ways has its notes of vindication. ``It
reminds us not to devalue the types of treatments that came
before,'' says Dr. Barron H. Lerner, a physician and medical
historian at the Columbia University College of Physicians and
Surgeons and the author of ``Contagion and Confinement,'' a history
of tuberculosis. ``Generally, people look back at these types of
procedures with disdain. They were seen as the types of things
people did when they didn't know what they were doing. But it's
really fortunate that there are people around who can still do
these operations.''
 &HT;    Pomerantz takes no satisfaction from the new premium being put
on his old skills, nor from this new awareness that medicine is not
a straight road but a looping and meandering one.
 &HT;    ``Don't think for a minute that I want to be doing this,'' he
says. ``It would be better if the drugs worked for everything _
cancer, heart disease, TB, but drugs will never be the 100 percent
answer. It's time we stop believing in a magic pill.''
 &HT;    The patient, Sonesacksith Choummanivong, is a 22-year-old
fine-arts student who is known to his family and his doctors as
Toon. The word means ``groundhog'' in Laotian, his native language,
and it became his nickname because, as an infant, he had chubby
cheeks. The moniker has stuck, a sad counterpoint to all the years
of illness that have left him gaunt and pale.
 &HT;    There is poignancy, too, in the fact that this gentle young man,
with his delicate artist's fingers, represents everything today's

   WASHINGTON _ Bob Mrazek has a problem. He has produced a prize
pig, and now it's time to sell it to the slaughterhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Mrazek thinks so much of his pig that he's trying to make a
special deal, that once it becomes the property of the
slaughterhouse, it'll continue to receive kindly treatment, same as
if it had remained with him.
</P>
<P>
   Never gonna happen.
</P>
<P>
   In way of explanation ...
</P>
<P>
   What Mrazek is selling goes by the name of ``Stonewall's Gold.''
It's not really a pig, it's a novel that he's published. The
slaughterhouse is called Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Mrazek (pronounced ``muh-RAZ-ik'') is a former Congressman from
New York state, now living the life of a successful writer in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stonewall's Gold'' is all about the Civil War, which Mrazek
knows all about. He can even tell you who General Grant was
sleeping with on the night before the Battle of Gettysburg.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year I wrote a complimentary review of
``Stonewall's Gold,'' which, in truth, is about the only kind of
reviews I ever write. If I don't like a book, I won't take up your
time telling you about it.
</P>
<P>
   I liked ``Stonewall's Gold'' ($22.95, St. Martin's Press) as
much as anything I've read lately. Set in the final winter of the
Civil War, the story is told through the voice of a 15-year-old
Southerner, Jamie Lockhart, as he makes his way across the wilds of
Virginia in search of a secret cache of Yankee bullion.
</P>
<P>
   I had talked with Mrazek on the phone but never met him. While I
was in Washington, we made it a point to visit.
</P>
<P>
   What with the success of his first published novel _ picked by
Literary Guild for an alternative selection and included in the May
edition of Reader's Digest condensed books _ I thought he'd be as
happy as ... well, a pig in mud.
</P>
<P>
   Not so. Dealing with Hollywood for the film rights, he is
beginning to feel a bit soiled.
</P>
<P>
   He told several stories of his misadventures. This one was my
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   A producer was going on and on about how wonderful, how
marvelous, how truly touched by greatness his book was. But as a
film, what it really needed was ``contemporizing.''
</P>
<P>
   The author said he wasn't sure what the producer meant by
contemporizing. After all, it's a Civil War story.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw 'Titanic,''' the producer said. ``You know the old
lady, the survivor, who remembers back on the sinking. That's what
we need for your story _ something today's kids can identify
with.''
</P>
<P>
   There's always Katharine Danridge, the beautiful young woman who
joins Jamie in the quest for gold. She was 18 at the time. That
would make her just a little past 150 years old now, Mrazek noted.
</P>
<P>
   A minor detail for Hollywood. Maybe she'd been frozen in time,
kidnapped by space aliens. There are all sorts of ways to get
around it _ as long as it's something today's kids can identify
with.
</P>
<P>
   Mrazek, as of this writing, hasn't made a decision on selling
the film rights. What he'd like is to have script approval, or even
better to write the movie version himself _ whatever is required to
preserve the integrity of the book.
</P>
<P>
   That well could happen.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hollywood may come around to his point of view.
</P>
<P>
   When pigs fly.

CITY'S FATE FORETOLD REGION'S MISERY 
</HEADLINE>
   TAKES   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VUKOVAR, Croatia _ In a restaurant on the banks of the Danube,
listening to the roar of bullfrogs from across the mighty river and
watching the fireworks away to the southeast, one might find it
hard to imagine that this is where it all began: The murders, the
ethnic expulsions, the whole prolonged spasm of war crimes that
still consumes the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But that is Serbia across the water, and the frogs are soon
silenced by the roar of NATO jets. The ``fireworks'' are
antiaircraft fire. And, when day breaks, Vukovar is revealed as a
place of catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees are trickling back from the Croatian cities whence they
fled in 1991, when Vukovar was crushed by the Yugoslav Army. If
their houses are not in the great majority that were destroyed,
they often find they must first evict Serbs, who fled their own
homes in more westerly regions of Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   Much that sickened the world later in Bosnia and Kosovo happened
here first. So as the United States and its allies in Europe settle
into difficult, prolonged peacekeeping roles in those places,
Vukovar is a good place in which to look at whether the evils set
loose in 1991 can ever be extinguished.
</P>
<P>
   The short answer probably is yes, but not along the lines being
pursued so far by the nations of the region and the international
community.
</P>
<P>
   Too much disputed history, too many unresolved social tensions,
too many festering personal grievances are being brushed aside,
much as they were after World War II. People cling to the fiction
that, with time, the differences between Serbs and Croats here,
which grew terribly greater during the war, will just fade away.
</P>
<P>
   Some Croats say it is too soon to confront what happened. Some
Serbs say it is too late.
</P>
<P>
   So Croat and Serb children go to school in the same buildings _
but learn separate histories and use different alphabets.
</P>
<P>
   And unmarked graves containing the mangled remains of old people
are uncovered every few days, the awful stench of the bodies
choking neighborhoods where people struggle with how to handle the
reality that many of their loved ones still are ``missing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am for all the mass graves to be dug out,'' said Ankica
Mikic, who works to help former neighbors of different ethnicities
live together again. ``When everyone who has something to say says
it, and everyone can go back to his own house, then we will have
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   But few people would agree with her publicly, and none of those
things she seeks is happening. ``The situation is very hard, and
getting harder,'' said Mikic, an ethnic Serb who is a native of
Croatia. ``Both the returnees and people who stayed are full of
emotion. There is a big amount a fear among the people _ of the
government, of their neighbors, of the returnees.''
</P>
<P>
   Mikic directs a nongovernmental organization called the Center
for Peace, Legal Advice, and Psycho-Social Assistance. The name
describes major needs of people in Vukovar, but there are many
others.
</P>
<P>
   Reconstruction aid, police protection, and jobs are all in
critically short supply, and the way those resources are being
allocated suggests that the Croatian regime is discriminating
against ethnic Serbs, some of whom have lived in the region for
generations.
</P>
<P>
   This may be justified by the way Serb administrators and
military men acted when they were in charge, according to local
people who are working, often with only minimal tools and
resources, to resurrect the city, but it is no way to solve the
region's problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not every Serb made war crimes, only individuals, a few,''
said Zdravko Funaric, 41, as he doused his sweat-soaked, sun-seared
head and shoulders in cold water after a day's work rebuilding the
106-year-old Tomo Goreta Gymnasium, an imposing school building in
the style of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serbs also stayed here in Vukovar and helped defend the city
and defend Croatia,'' he said, echoing views, heard often from
individuals here, that it was greedy, power-hungry individuals, not
Serbs as a people, who fanned ethnic tensions for their own gain.
</P>
<P>
   Now everyone suffers except the well-connected, according to
Damir Ivanovic, 29, the child of a Bosnian mother and a Croatian
father. His father was raised in Serbia, Ivanovic in Germany. The
family returned to Yugoslavia in 1984 because of the
then-teenager's passion to ``live in my own country.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of his upbringing, Ivanovic does not speak with a
standard Croat accent. As a result, he sometimes is snubbed as a
Serb by other Croats, and is afraid to go into areas where tensions
between the groups are particularly high.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way things are now,'' he said dispiritedly, ``I'll
probably go to another foreign country. I'm married, and have a
little kid, and there's no future here for him. Or for me.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why Vukovar became the flash point for war, and for ethnic
cleansing, is easy to see on a drive through the rich black soil
and Ohio-scale cornfields of Eastern Slavonia, the easternmost
region of Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in the Middle Ages because of its strategic location for
commerce and defense, Vukovar saw its military value wane after the
city was conquered by Ottoman emperor Suleiman the Magnificent in
1526. But its military significance was tragically restored by the
disintegration of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   To control the Danube and minimize dislocation of ethnic Serbs,
Yugoslav authorities, who were trying to gather as many Serbs as
possible into one state, decided they had to have this city.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in August 1991 and ending that November, the Yugoslav
Army laid siege to the town of 42,000 and cleared the surrounding
suburbs and outlying towns, where another 42,000 lived, of most of
their Croat residents.
</P>
<P>
   The siege of Vukovar was medieval: Snipers shot children and
women going to wells during cease-fires. Yugoslav artillerymen
leveled churches and hospitals, schools, and historic sites,
including those marked in conformance with international
conventions. In the aftermath, the victorious forces executed
civilians and wounded soldiers in the main hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this would happen elsewhere subsequently, in Dubrovnik,
Sarajevo, Mostar, and Kosovo. But the first time, the world barely
noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Vukovar achieved Alamo status in Croatia because of the valor of
its defenders, a few thousand poorly armed, undertrained defenders
who held out for 86 days against the tanks, planes, and massed
troops of an encircling modern army.
</P>
<P>
   When the end came, 1,700 were confirmed dead, 5,000 were taken
away to detention camps in Yugoslavia, and there were 500 bodies
that could not be identified, according to Lovre Pejkovic, head of
Croatia's federal Office for Displaced Persons and Refugees. Most
factories were destroyed.

   TAKE-BOS  
 VUKOVAR, Croatia: ... were destroyed.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Croatians assert to have killed more than 10,000 Serbs, and
to have destroyed 300 tanks and 25 aircraft. They say the
determination of the defenders delayed the attackers enough for the
rest of the new country to prepare defenses against the coming
onslaught. Today, every city and town in Croatia has a street
renamed for Vukovar.
</P>
<P>
   The city was under Serbian control for the next four years. But
as the balance of power in the region began to shift in favor of
Croatia, which conducted two highly successful military campaigns
in 1995 to regain lost territory, Vukovar and its vicinity were
placed in a UN protectorate. By early last year, the ruined and
depopulated town returned to Croatian hands.
</P>
<P>
   How many people live in Vukovar now, and their ethnicity, are
matters of intense political sensitivity. That's in part because
counts of displaced persons influence international aid, in part
because of upcoming elections in which many Croatians say the
ruling party could be ousted. Vukovar town officials release no
demographic information about the municipality.
</P>
<P>
   Pejkovic said the population is now about 3,000 Croats who have
registered, and 2,000 others who have not yet decided to change
their status from displaced person to returnee. He said he cannot
estimate the number of Serbs. Ruza Maric, director of the local
museum, the institution most involved in pulling together the
records of the war era, estimates the number of Croats at 2,000 and
of Serbs at 8,000, based on school enrollment, requests for ID
cards, and applications for reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal to have Vukovar the same as it was before,'' said
Pejkovic, noting that a critical shortage of jobs is exacerbating
tensions. Borovo, a diversified conglomerate which before the war
employed about 22,000 people,  &UR; today &LR;  has about 500 workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Job creation is a huge problem,'' he said. ``If there were
more jobs, maybe there would be a good peaceful situation for both
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tall memorial candles on brass stands, their flames protected
from the breeze by red glass, stand incongruously amid hacked-back
weeds at the opening of a well. The choking odor of rotten human
flesh is in the air, but the workers being lowered into the well
shaft are used to it.
</P>
<P>
   This is Berak, a village in the suburbs of Vukovar which was
overrun and barricaded when the attack on the city began. If Serbs
and Croats are ever to live together again here, both must come to
terms with the experience of the inhabitants of this village, and
places like it.
</P>
<P>
   Knots of housewives approach the well, their arms wrapped
tightly around their chests. Neighborhood children hang on the
fringes, chattering quietly, curious.
</P>
<P>
   The remains of Ljubica Garvanovic have already been brought up,
the 60-year-old grandmother identified by the valuable old gold
coins she always carried in a matchbox in a cloth bag around her
neck. So has her son, Magic, whose remains still has identity
papers on it. They are in body bags nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the skull and long black braid of someone else. A
housewife gasps and walks away. A police officer shoos the children
off. The long, delicate process of extracting a person's bones from
the pit begins.
</P>
<P>
   This is the 117th site unearthed in Croatia containing civilians
who apparently were executed. Some sites have as few as two bodies,
some over 200. Nearly 3,000 bodies have been found like this, and
about 1,700 more who are missing are believed to have been disposed
of similarly.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Drinko Balicevic, who is supervising the excavation for the
Ministry of Health, points out, without evident irony, that from
the fragments of grenades and mortar shells found in many elderly
victims, ``it is evident that they did not die naturally, but were
liquidated.'' The presence of large sums of money on some, he
added, ``leads us to the thought that robbery was not the motive.''
Nearby, last week, he supervised a site where 16 bodies, 13 of them
from Berak, were found.
</P>
<P>
   Mlacika Rusnov, who dresses in black and looks older than her 71
years, knew all three of the people whose bodies were pulled from
the well. They, and she, were among 106 Croats whom the Serbs
released on Dec. 13, 1991, after three months in detention houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget that Santa Lucia'' festival ``if I live 100
more years. They did whatever they wanted to us, came into our
house, beat us. I could hear Evica's scream as they took her around
the village, raping her,'' she said, referring to a younger woman
who now has returned to the village.
</P>
<P>
   During the second night of terror, the two older women whose
bodies have been pulled from the well were taken to the command
center, she said, and were never seen alive again. Survivors who
returned knew where to look for the bodies. The next morning,
Rusnov said, the soldiers talked openly of what they had done as
they herded the remaining Croats to town hall to sign documents
``voluntarily'' surrendering their property, then put them on the
road out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Her grandchildren, both teenagers, have listened raptly to what
must be the umpteenth telling of the story. Now they hear their
father say ``there is no problem. Life is going on. I work with
Serbs. My children go to school with Serbs. It's separate classes,
OK. But they spend time together. The neighboring house is a Serb
house . . .''
</P>
<P>
   It is staggering self-deception, a statement that by facial
expressions the children, and perhaps the father, too, indicate
they disbelieve.
</P>
<P>
   What does he tell his children about this history? ``The
truth!'' his wife, Marija, who has been silent through the
conversation, and whose grandmother is among the missing,
interjects forcefully.
</P>
<P>
   The Croatian government insists it is looking into alleged war
crimes dispassionately, without regard to whether the victims are
Serb or Croat. A well-informed diplomatic source in Zagreb, the
capital, said that, too, is nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very real war crimes were committed. The Serb occupation was
brutal,'' the source said. ``When the Croats retook territory'' in
1995 ``_ payback time. There was three months of looting, mayhem,
and murder. There are mass graves on both sides, but the government
makes no effort to exhume the graves of the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Maric, the Vukovar museum director, has spent much of her adult
life working in what was once a magnificent, mid-18th century manor
house of the German nobility. It was one of the first structures
shelled. By the time the Croats regained Vukovar, the house was a
stripped ruin. With help from UNESCO and other international
agencies, the staff has verified that treasures that were not
stolen or destroyed in the war are now in a museum across the
river, in Novi Sad. The Serbs, she said, will not discuss returning
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can think in my mind that all people are not the same, but I
was living in exile when my father died, when my friends died,''
she said. ``Many Croats, you cannot find hate for Serbs in their
eyes. They will say at the end of their stories of the deaths and
beatings and imprisonments of their families `I don't hate Serbs. I
just don't want to live with them. I have no interest in those
people.' ''

DOUBTS ON AIR POWER MAY BE DISPROVED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a strange development, but President Clinton might end up
best-remembered as the first leader in history to win a war with
air power alone.
</P>
<P>
   Most military analysts have long held such an achievement to be
impossible. Bombing can wear out and soften up the enemy, the
argument goes, but ultimately, only troops on the ground can push
an army out of occupied territory.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after suffering 72 days of NATO bombing, Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic surrendered as close to unconditionally as
anyone might have imagined. And he did so without a single NATO
soldier firing a shot from the ground or any troops amassing on his
borders.
</P>
<P>
   A debate will probably rage for months or years over just which
pressures led Milosevic to cave. The outcome of this debate could
have dramatic consequences, well into the next century, for the
contours of global diplomacy, the perception of American power, and
the structure of the American military.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is possible that strategic bombing _ punishment of the
Serbian population _ did the deal here,'' said Robert Pape,
professor at Dartmouth College, whose book, ``Bombing to Win,''
demonstrated that air power by itself has never won a war.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it did work, you're going to see a lot more use of air
power, because it's really easy to punish populations, and you
don't lose any American lives,'' Pape continued. ``You could get
rid of the Army, a lot of the Navy, and just use cruise missiles to
blow up power plants. This will be the US Air Force's world.''
</P>
<P>
   Pape and other analysts, for now, are holding back from such a
judgment. For one thing, it is not entirely clear that air power
did win all by itself.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two weeks, US and NATO officials say, the Kosovo
Liberation Army grew a lot stronger _ so much so that its raids on
Serbian military positions forced Serb troops to come out of hiding
and fight. As they did so, US A-10 attack planes suddenly appeared
overhead and pummeled Serbian tanks, armored personnel vehicles,
and artillery.
</P>
<P>
   If this one-two punch was what tipped the balance of power, it
nonetheless puts a new twist to the traditional concept of
``combined-arms'' warfare. The idea used to be that air power would
assist the troops on the ground. Now, it seems, ground troops serve
as little more than feints to bring the enemy out in the open, and
force him to concentrate into target-packets for the airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   John Pike, military specialist at the Federation of American
Scientists, thinks both types of air warfare _ bombing the Serbian
troops in Kosovo and the various targets in Belgrade and other Serb
cities _ took their toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite possible that Milosevic would have been content
letting his 19-year-old draftees get slaughtered in the field, if
everything was fine at home,'' Pike said. ``He might have been
content if he was doing well militarily in Kosovo, despite all the
destruction in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when he was getting degraded everywhere _ when everything
was going against him _ then that's when he had no choice but give
up,'' Pike continued.
</P>
<P>
   William M. Arkin, a former US Army intelligence officer and a
consultant to the United Nations, said, ``The main thing is that
Milosevic failed to achieve his objective _ which was to wait it
out till the NATO coalition collapsed. That didn't happen. The war
ended because Milosevic didn't outlast the bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   In this sense, Arkin said, all of NATO's fine-tuned strategies
concerning which targets to hit, and in what order to
``choreograph'' the destruction, had no effect whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't matter what we bombed,'' Arkin said. ``It just
mattered that we bombed. It was sheer repetition, sheer brute
force, and Milosevic finally concluded it wasn't going to stop.
Before people say we need more cruise missiles or more smart
weapons, they might want to consider _ this is not calculus, this
is mystery. It is utterly unclear what it was about the bombing
that forced Milosevic to capitulate.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, few dispute that it was bombing _ and, from the point of
view of what NATO contributed to the fight, bombing alone _ that
won the war. And that is what could change not just the way people
think about warfare but also the way the world conducts it.
</P>
<P>
   John Keegan, the eminent military historian, admitted in
Thursday's London Daily Telegraph that he was ``wrong'' to think
bombing would not be enough to win. When he first began to realize
this, he wrote, ``I turned the thought around for a while and
looked at it from several directions, rather as a Creationist
Christian might have done on being shown his first dinosaur bones.
I didn't want to change my beliefs, but there was too much evidence
accumulating to stick to the article of faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Keegan sees the war as a victory not just for air power but for
the ``New World Order'' that President Bush declared after the Gulf
War. ``If Milosevic really is a beaten man, all other would-be
Milosevics around the world will have to reconsider their plans,''
Keegan wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the planes that bombed Serbia into submission took off
from distant aircraft carriers, some from the continental United
States. ``What that means is that there are now no places on Earth
that cannot be subjected to the same relentless harrowing,'' he
continued. ``What that implies . . . is that no rational ruler will
choose to commit the crimes that have attracted such punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion here is that, just as British gunboats once
sailed by distant lands and imposed order by threatening to shell
the harbor, now American B-2 bombers will fly over distant lands
and impose order by threatening to drop smart bombs on their power
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts shudder at this possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Eliot A. Cohen, professor at the Johns Hopkins School for
Advanced International Studies and author of the US Air Force's
five-volume study of the air war against Iraq, said of Keegan's
view, ``That would be a very dangerous lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen continued, ``Yes, in a sense, air power won. We threw
everything we had at a country whose gross domestic product is
one-15th the size of the US military budget, and after 72 days and
a lot of mess-ups, we succeeded. Maybe that's our future. But to
draw sweeping generalizations for air power _ that's a big mistake.
In 20 years' time, if we're up against the Chinese, it's a
different story.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also cautioned, ``Other people react to these sorts of
things.'' If Western leaders suddenly conclude that knocking out a
country's power plants is an effective technique of foreign policy,
then various foes might figure out ways to destroy power plants
here.
</P>
<P>
   And what if Westerners never really discover what pushed
Milosevic over the edge?
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's true that bombing did it all I want to know that it's
true, I want to know the world has changed,'' Pape said. ``Maybe it
is true, maybe it's a new world now. But if it's not and we think
it is, we're going to learn a lot of false lessons, we're going to
make a lot of bad mistakes.''

JEERS, CHEERS FOR 10-YEAR-OLD TRADE PACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (i and f designations)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Ten years ago, the signing of the US-Canada Free
Trade Agreement caused a sea change in the way the world's two
largest trading partners do business.
</P>
<P>
   But Canadians are wondering whether the anniversary warrants
cheers, jeers or even tears.
</P>
<P>
   Not in this century has an economic issue split Canadians or
roused more anti-American feeling than the 1989 pact that knocked
down most remaining barriers to the flow of goods and services
between the two countries. The US-Canada deal led directly to the
North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, which came five
years later when Mexico signed on.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, as Canada and the United States coyly hint at the
possibility of even more intimate forms of economic embrace _ such
as a common currency, North America's answer to the Euro _ the
trade pact remains a prickly issue in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents still insist Canada sold its soul to America Inc.,
losing some of its cultural identity and a great deal of its
autonomy in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Just listen to Maude Barlow of the nationalist Council of
Canadians: ``Ten years of free trade has dramatically Americanized
Canadian society and imposed on our country the inequality, culture
and corporate governance of our southern neighbor.''
</P>
<P>
   But such discouraging words were seldom heard this past weekend
as some of the best-known champions of free trade _ including
former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and former President George
Bush _ gathered at Montreal's McGill University for a conference on
free trade that was really more of a 10th anniversary lovefest,
with few naysayers to spoil the mood.
</P>
<P>
   Mulroney, who led Canada from 1984 to 1993, and whose insistence
on closer trade ties with the United States made him one of the
most widely despised prime ministers in the country's history,
credited the pact and other politically unpopular policies of his
government with restoring vigor to Canada's economy.
</P>
<P>
   The US-Canada Free Trade Agreement spawned NAFTA, which is
better known to Americans since deals with Mexico stir more
controversy in the United States than deals with Canada. In Canada,
there is always more trepidation and hostility toward agreements
with the mighty neighbor than with other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian proponents of free trade say their country has reaped
fantastic economic benefits, mainly in the form of dramatically
increased exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past 10 years have seen what can only be described as an
explosion of trade,'' said John McCallum, chief economist for the
Royal Bank of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Goods and services worth more than $1 billion a day now cross
the US-Canada border, by far the largest trading relationship in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, Canadian exports to the US have jumped 169
percent, while US exports to Canada have increased 149 percent. By
the same token, however, Canada has become more dependent on the
United States for its economic well-being: Trade with the southern
neighbor accounts for 28.4 percent of Canada's total economic
output, nearly double what it was a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even McCallum, a booster, conceded that the free trade has been
a bit of a mixed blessing _ or at least not a totally unqualified
success. ``It merits two cheers, not three,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the surge in exports, the Canadian economy is far from
matching the boom across the border. Unemployment rates remain
high, 8.3 percent of the labor force, or double the jobless rate in
the United States. Canadians workers are less productive than
Americans, making the country less competitive. There is a
worrisome loss of the country's brightest doctors, scientists,
entrepreneurs and other talent to the higher pay levels and lower
taxes of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Canada remains one of the planet's most prosperous nations. But
living standards have actually slipped, at least statistically,
since the inception of free trade, with the disposable income of
the average citizen dropping by more than 5 percent, against a 12
percent increase for Americans, according to Royal Bank figures.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, although hundreds of thousands of new jobs have been
created in Canada over the past 10 years, hundreds of thousands of
jobs in previously protected industries have been lost.
</P>
<P>
   But Canadian big business is bullish on the benefits of free
trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an unambiguous success,'' said Tom D'Aquino,
president of the Business Council on National Issues, which
represents Canada's top 150 companies. ``It has been the catalyst,
which has reshaped the thinking and attitudes of Canadian
governments, workers and enterprises. As a result, we are vastly
more globally oriented and more conscious of who we are in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The major complaint most Canadians seem to have against free
trade is that it has left Canada more vulnerable to the cultural
juggernaut of the United States. Indeed, the McGill conference took
place only a few days after Canada suffered one of its sourest
trade defeats at the hands of the United States, with Ottawa
finally agreeing to remove barriers against American magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Canada had sought to protect its own magazine industry on the
grounds that magazines are an expression of culture, not just a
business. But the United States used the Free Trade Agreement _
coupled with threats of economic reprisal _ to batter that notion
to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's talk of a total integration of the economies of the
United States, Canada, and Mexico, one in which the three countries
might even adopt a common currency. And Canadians have little doubt
which currency would prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can bet it won't carry the maple leaf or the Queen,''
commented free-trade opponent Barlow in a recent article.

ADVICE UNHEEDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Less than two weeks ago, the ``consensus'' around
here had decided that the indictment for war crimes of Slobodan
Milosevic by the international tribunal in The Hague was just about
the worst thing that could have happened.
</P>
<P>
   It was bound to mess up the chances for a quick resolution of
the Kosovo mess, we were told. Facing the klink, Milosevic was
certain to dig in even deeper. And, of course, as long as his
shrinking domain was facing attacks ``only'' from above, a
dictator's ability to hold on was by conventional definition
indefinite because bombing could never resolve a situation on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   I remember attempting at the time to determine if there was some
basis for all this certainty from the twin commentariats of think
tank and media muse and concluding that it was all coming out of
thin air. The difference between analysis of news and what is
charitably called speculation acquired more weight when, just days
later, Milosevic accepted on paper a diktat from his opponents as
well as from Russia without any discernible regard for the fact
that he had just been indicted.
</P>
<P>
   And this was just one of the latest episodes in a string going
back to the evening in late March just before the first bombs began
to fall on Serbia, when the fact that then-Russian Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov's plane had done a U-turn over the Atlantic was
confidently said to spell a disastrous rupture in US-Russian
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Now we're all at it again, like passengers massed on one side of
a ferry boat all running to the other side. As I write, there isn't
any ink to dry on any agreement, and already we're imagining the
impact of ``success.''
</P>
<P>
   The only people I trust in military and diplomatic circles have
been vehemently urging caution for days _ caution about whether
there will be any Serbian ink, whether it will dry, what will
happen if it does, and how any ``agreement'' will be implemented.
The one thing I can count on, they keep saying, is that the
military campaign will not end until there is an unmistakable sign
that ``all'' Serbian forces in Kosovo are on the way back to
Serbia. In short, the advice is that we should take it a day at a
time, and you would think that in a business supposedly structured
around breaking news that would be advice that people know how to
take.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not how most of the system is operating. If there's
one guaranteed loser out of all this it is misnamed 24-hour news
cycle, built around television but with print a significant
enabler.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of this decade, the crisis that became the
Persian Gulf War enshrined the never-ending news cycle with genuine
success _ led by a maturing CNN with a major assist from the
traditional networks.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard news, as in information, all the time. Sure it
missed a few _ the true record of the Patriot missile and
``precision'' bombing, the significance of Saddam Hussein's
permitted survival, Gulf War Syndrome _ but that was the nature of
the story, not the coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward. Today, the traditional networks have cut past the
bone on coverage, and CNN remains fantastic but only during the
diminishing hours when it actually has news on. What the system,
enabled by print new cable networks, is really selling and
competing over is spin and attitude _ pursuits mostly suitable for
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   And so, while the bombs fell, the mob gave us Milosevic's
first-week triumph that could not be reversed, Madeleine Albright's
war, the decimation of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the securely
dug-in Serbian armed forces, the emergence of nasty Russia as
political power triumphant, almost daily accounts of NATO's
collapse of unity and will, the pointless futility of air
campaigns, and the hideous timing of the war crimes court.
</P>
<P>
   By emphasizing the spin cycle to such an extent, the system has
once again compromised the credibility of its once-basic product,
news. Any hints that anybody learned anything from the impeachment
fiasco are clearly premature.
</P>
<P>
   But the proprietors of printing presses and networks should
understand that confusing people in a crisis is the worst way to
promote your product when more people are paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, my private phone lines are open and my TV is
tuned to C-SPAN. Slower, but much more reliable.

JEERS, CHEERS FOR 10-YEAR-OLD TRADE PACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (i and f designations)

<P>
   MONTREAL _ Ten years ago, the signing of the US-Canada Free
Trade Agreement caused a sea change in the way the world's two
largest trading partners do business.
</P>
<P>
   But Canadians are wondering whether the anniversary warrants
cheers, jeers or even tears.
</P>
<P>
   Not in this century has an economic issue split Canadians or
roused more anti-American feeling than the 1989 pact that knocked
down most remaining barriers to the flow of goods and services
between the two countries. The US-Canada deal led directly to the
North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, which came five
years later when Mexico signed on.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, as Canada and the United States coyly hint at the
possibility of even more intimate forms of economic embrace _ such
as a common currency, North America's answer to the Euro _ the
trade pact remains a prickly issue in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents still insist Canada sold its soul to America Inc.,
losing some of its cultural identity and a great deal of its
autonomy in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Just listen to Maude Barlow of the nationalist Council of
Canadians: ``Ten years of free trade has dramatically Americanized
Canadian society and imposed on our country the inequality, culture
and corporate governance of our southern neighbor.''
</P>
<P>
   But such discouraging words were seldom heard this past weekend
as some of the best-known champions of free trade _ including
former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and former President George
Bush _ gathered at Montreal's McGill University for a conference on
free trade that was really more of a 10th anniversary lovefest,
with few naysayers to spoil the mood.
</P>
<P>
   Mulroney, who led Canada from 1984 to 1993, and whose insistence
on closer trade ties with the United States made him one of the
most widely despised prime ministers in the country's history,
credited the pact and other politically unpopular policies of his
government with restoring vigor to Canada's economy.
</P>
<P>
   The US-Canada Free Trade Agreement spawned NAFTA, which is
better known to Americans since deals with Mexico stir more
controversy in the United States than deals with Canada. In Canada,
there is always more trepidation and hostility toward agreements
with the mighty neighbor than with other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian proponents of free trade say their country has reaped
fantastic economic benefits, mainly in the form of dramatically
increased exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past 10 years have seen what can only be described as an
explosion of trade,'' said John McCallum, chief economist for the
Royal Bank of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Goods and services worth more than $1 billion a day now cross
the US-Canada border, by far the largest trading relationship in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, Canadian exports to the US have jumped 169
percent, while US exports to Canada have increased 149 percent. By
the same token, however, Canada has become more dependent on the
United States for its economic well-being: Trade with the southern
neighbor accounts for 28.4 percent of Canada's total economic
output, nearly double what it was a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even McCallum, a booster, conceded that the free trade has been
a bit of a mixed blessing _ or at least not a totally unqualified
success. ``It merits two cheers, not three,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the surge in exports, the Canadian economy is far from
matching the boom across the border. Unemployment rates remain
high, 8.3 percent of the labor force, or double the jobless rate in
the United States. Canadians workers are less productive than
Americans, making the country less competitive. There is a
worrisome loss of the country's brightest doctors, scientists,
entrepreneurs and other talent to the higher pay levels and lower
taxes of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Canada remains one of the planet's most prosperous nations. But
living standards have actually slipped, at least statistically,
since the inception of free trade, with the disposable income of
the average citizen dropping by more than 5 percent, against a 12
percent increase for Americans, according to Royal Bank figures.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, although hundreds of thousands of new jobs have been
created in Canada over the past 10 years, hundreds of thousands of
jobs in previously protected industries have been lost.
</P>
<P>
   But Canadian big business is bullish on the benefits of free
trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an unambiguous success,'' said Tom D'Aquino,
president of the Business Council on National Issues, which
represents Canada's top 150 companies. ``It has been the catalyst,
which has reshaped the thinking and attitudes of Canadian
governments, workers and enterprises. As a result, we are vastly
more globally oriented and more conscious of who we are in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The major complaint most Canadians seem to have against free
trade is that it has left Canada more vulnerable to the cultural
juggernaut of the United States. Indeed, the McGill conference took
place only a few days after Canada suffered one of its sourest
trade defeats at the hands of the United States, with Ottawa
finally agreeing to remove barriers against American magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Canada had sought to protect its own magazine industry on the
grounds that magazines are an expression of culture, not just a
business. But the United States used the Free Trade Agreement _
coupled with threats of economic reprisal _ to batter that notion
to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's talk of a total integration of the economies of the
United States, Canada, and Mexico, one in which the three countries
might even adopt a common currency. And Canadians have little doubt
which currency would prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can bet it won't carry the maple leaf or the Queen,''
commented free-trade opponent Barlow in a recent article.

BUSH CRAMMING BEFORE CAMPAIGNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Governor George W. Bush of Texas recently sent an urgent e-mail
message to his top foreign-affairs adviser: What is this dispute in
East Timor all about?
</P>
<P>
   The adviser, Condoleezza Rice, had to scramble to explain the
fighting in the former Portuguese colony to gain independence from
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The request was hardly unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Every few days, Rice and other advisers receive missives from
the man who's taking the cram course of a lifetime, preparing to be
a Republican presidential candidate, and, if successful, president
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to explore all topics, foreign and domestic, Bush
has convened meetings with advisers on everything from gasoline
additives to tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after months of buildup, perhaps comparable to the release
of the latest Star Wars movie, the front-runner is about to be
tested. This week, he is visiting Iowa, New Hampshire, Maine, and
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   For four days, the public and press will try to pin Bush down on
everything from farm policy to foreign policy. And there may be
queries on his now-famously oblique admission: ``When I was young
and irresponsible, I was young and irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just trying to anticipate as many potential feeding
frenzies as we can,'' said David Beckwith, a Bush media adviser who
participated in a series of preparation sessions with the governor
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a question of whether there will be a feeding
frenzy. You can stomp out 999 of them, and I guess it is worthwhile
to do so. But that doesn't mean the 1,000th isn't going to envelop
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckwith, who was press secretary for Vice President Dan Quayle
when George H. W. Bush was in office, said half-jokingly that the
best preparation for George W. Bush might be ``to put him in a room
and have a couple of hundred people start screaming at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush the younger technically is still ``exploring'' a
candidacy, aides said there is no doubt that he is running.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Bush has been the proverbial ``empty vessel,'' and many
people of all political persuasions have poured in their hopes and
dreams for the type of person who will win the White House. The
danger for Bush is that as he defines himself on an array of
issues, some people might be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that it is a real challenge that we have to go
from zero to 60 in two seconds,'' said a Bush adviser, Mark
McKinnon. ``The expectations are exponentially high, and it will be
very difficult to meet the expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers even wonder how the governor's laid-back public
manner might resonate on the stump. At a news conference last
Tuesday, which was broadcast on CNN, his performance seemed
underwhelming as Bush extolled the Texas Legislature's approval of
education and tax-cut proposals, which he now plans to highlight on
the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Bush does not have to worry just yet about East Timor. He also
has to be familiar with an array of issues important to Iowa and
New Hampshire, such as hog prices, ethanol, and education taxes,
since those two states hold the first caucus and primary early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   But the two states may be almost as foreign to the governor of
Texas as East Timor. Bush recently said he could not recall the
last time he was in New Hampshire, but it was probably during his
father's campaign in 1992. By contrast, many of Bush's opponents
have practically made New Hampshire their second home.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been preparing for the campaign trail by holding
meetings with groups headed by three key advisers: Rice on foreign
policy, former Federal Reserve Board member Lawrence Lindsey on
economics, and Mayor Stephen Goldsmith of Indianapolis on domestic
issues.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings usually last three hours, and the advisers usually
present Bush with outlines of key issues and a set of various
positions on each. Bush takes notes, asks questions, and often
follows up by sending newspaper articles and op-ed pieces to the
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has basically asked me to convene the best and the
brightest thinkers whose views and principles are consistent with
his, and to look at bold ideas that would help the country,''
Goldsmith said. ``Many of them fit inside his philosophy of
`compassionate conservatism.' ''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush is taking courses on everything from economics to the
environment, he is not necessarily forming policies he will outline
on this trip. Instead, Bush hopes to spell out his general
philosophy and explain the specifics much later, a strategy the
governor realizes could lead to criticism that he is vague.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to understand that campaigns evolve,'' Bush said in a
recent interview in Austin, Texas. ``I will be asked to comment on
a lot of issues as I campaign. Sometimes the press corps want a
candidate to lay all their policy cards at one time. Candidates,
campaigns, on the other hand, have a cycle. The constituency is
really the electorate as opposed to those who are following the
campaign in the press corps. I understand there will be some
tension: `Why won't he talk about this issue now?' But that is how
campaigns evolve.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush lacks some credentials that Republican presidential
candidates have often been able to offer. For example, he has
little foreign-policy experience, in vivid contrast to his father,
who was CIA director and US ambassador to China. Brent Scowcroft,
who was President Bush's national security adviser, said the
younger Bush's main experience ``was being around when his father
was in his many different jobs. . . . Is he comfortable with
foreign policy? I would say not.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rice, who also served as President Bush's special assistant
for national security affairs, said the governor has had more
instruction in foreign affairs than many might realize.
</P>
<P>
   ``He certainly doesn't have a great deal of foreign affairs
experience,'' Rice said. ``He would be the first to say that. But
you can underestimate the amount of foreign affairs experience a
governor of a big border state has. I've been impressed with his
ability to understand and translate that into a whole set of
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, at a meeting with his foreign policy team, Bush
surprised some aides by talking for about three-fourths of the
session. This contrasted with previous meetings, in which he had a
tendency to pose questions. The aides took this as a sign that Bush
is feeling more comfortable on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, according to a participant, an adviser asked Bush
whether he could back a Kosovo peace plan that leaves Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic in power. Bush, referring to the
indictment of Milosevic as a war criminal, responded with a joke:
``Let's have a ceremony celebrating the peace plan in The Hague,
and make sure he gets an invitation.''
</P>
<P>
   One issue for Bush has been to clarify his plan to cut taxes.
Meeting with his economic advisers, Bush has asked many questions
about a flat tax, an idea backed by several of his rivals, but a
thought he fears will be viewed as too favorable to the rich.
</P>
<P>
   According to one top aide, Bush has requested a plan that would
mostly help the middle class. But he has left the tax issue
unresolved for now.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also has rebuffed demands from some New Hampshire
Republicans that he sign a pledge against raising new taxes.
Mindful of how his father was defeated in 1992 after breaking his
pledge: ``Read my lips, no new taxes,'' the governor has told aides
that he does not plan to sign any pledges other than one in favor
of New Hampshire's retaining its first-primary status.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't sign pledges,'' said a Bush chief strategist, Karl
Rove. ``When people ask us to sign a pledge, we generally sign a
letter stating where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Representative Gerald R. Solomon of New York, who
organized a committee to draft Bush to run, cautioned that the path
ahead will be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is unique about this whole thing is we have 125 committed
members of Congress behind someone who is not a sitting vice
president, who is not in an anointed position,'' Solomon said. ``It
is hard to believe we have been this successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Solomon said, ``He needs to get in the fray and get himself
attuned before a coming hard campaign.''

ON PRIMARIES, TOWN IS ON THE MARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUDSON, N.H. _ Given its suburban tract housing and commercial
shopping strips, little is terribly distinctive about this small
town on the banks of the Merrimack River, just over the
Massachusetts line.
</P>
<P>
   Except that, it seems, its voters are always right.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1952, in election after election, the people of Hudson
have cast their ballots in New Hampshire's presidential primary,
the first in the nation. And they have picked the winners _
Republican and Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   No other city or town in New Hampshire shares that distinction,
although more than 20 claim rights as bellwethers on one side or
another of the partisan divide.
</P>
<P>
   So what is Hudson's secret? There's no divining the blend of
destiny and dumb luck that underlies the election-year distinction
of this town of 22,000, a mile outside Nashua and 40 miles north of
the Massachusetts line.
</P>
<P>
   But a visit to this conservative, middle-class community in the
heart of the so-called golden triangle _ the vote-rich area of
southern New Hampshire that is a popular hunting ground for
presidential candidates _ suggests one answer:
</P>
<P>
   Hudson has evolved as the state has evolved. Its sleepy,
agrarian past was New Hampshire past; its high-tech, suburban
present is New Hampshire present and future.
</P>
<P>
   And candidates who want to win in Hudson _ and thus, if history
holds, to win the primary _ will mark the change.
</P>
<P>
   Once home to dairy and produce farms, Hudson today hosts
Lockheed Commercial Electronics Co., Micronetics Inc., and Sanders
surveillance systems division. Such companies are a magnet for
out-of-state workers on the trail of opportunity, and so Hudson,
like much of southern New Hampshire, has become an outpost for Bay
State emigres.
</P>
<P>
   With new demographics have come new political concerns. For
2000, candidates are adjusting their pitch to tap into issues that
animate communities like Hudson, from sustaining the economic boom
to easing the increasingly infuriating traffic congestion that has
come with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hard-working town with a lot of good, honest,
down-to-earth, sincere people. I think they reflect the general
sentiment of the state as a whole,'' said Thomas P. Colantuono, an
executive councilor from Derry who represents the community.
</P>
<P>
   Its voters, like the state's, are an independent lot, hard to
pin down ideologically. Many now consider themselves independent
(5,595) rather than Republican (4,311) or Democratic (3,448). It is
a pattern that, like much about Hudson, has been replicated in many
communities across the state.
</P>
<P>
   Rhona Charbonneau, a town selectwoman, has watched Hudson grow
and change since she moved here in 1950. The 20-acre dairy farm,
with 65 milking cows, where she and her husband, Claude, lived,
worked, and raised five children, is now a subdivision. A similar
plight has visited most of the other old farms and orchards in the
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago, you knew everyone,'' she said. ``Now, I go into a
restaurant and I don't know anyone . . . It's unbelievable how it's
developed.''
</P>
<P>
   Charbonneau said she rarely gets calls from constituents
concerned about an issue. And while Elizabeth Dole, George W. Bush,
Lamar Alexander, and Steve Forbes have all been asking for
Charbonneau's backing, she thinks the voters in Hudson, for now,
are not the least bit interested in presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you find too many people right now who are
unhappy. They're working and earning money,'' she said. ``When they
get through with work, they want to spend time with their families.
They're just not interested.''
</P>
<P>
   That's certainly the case for Rick Milosh, the owner of Carpet
Creations in Brook Plaza here in Hudson. His showroom has tripled
in size for the eight years he's been in business, and he's
carpeting about 200 new homes a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not big into politics, more into working morning until
night,'' he said, voicing uncertainty of his party affiliation.
``When it starts getting closer, I'll pay more attention. My
business takes most of my time.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Cataldo, an insurance agent, watches the candidates who
are visiting the town a bit more closely. She wants a candidate who
is honest, and she worries about keeping the economy going, even
though business has been good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just built a new house on 12 acres, and I want to be able to
afford to live there and buy furniture,'' said Cataldo, an
independent.
</P>
<P>
   Although the economy has been brisk here, and jobs have been
plentiful, prosperity has not yielded much diversity. Hudson
remains a nearly all-white community, with almost no
African-Americans, Asian-Americans, or Latinos
</P>
<P>
   And while crime is a hot topic in other places, the most
pressing problem here is traffic congestion. A highway is in the
works, and a third elementary school is to be built for the
continuing influx of young families, many of whom commute to jobs
in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Few of Hudson's citizens receive welfare; The median family
income is $62,000 a year, and the average home sells for $120,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really isn't a bad part of town,'' said Fidele J.
Bernasconi, co-owner of the weekly Hudson Litchfield News. ``We
just don't have that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernasconi is keeping a sharp eye on the candidates who move
through the state. He wants to ask each what he or she would do to
get the federal government to fully fund its share of special
education in the public schools. He would also like to see term
limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians seem to get in office, and do whatever they
want,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire primary being less than a year away,
Bernasconi is not rushing to bandwagons. In 1996, he refused to
support Bob Dole because so many state politicians were for him. He
backed Alexander instead. This time, he says he's amazed at the
frenzy over Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's never been here,'' he said. ``Where does he stand, and
what does he stand for?''
</P>
<P>
   Bernasconi does not have answers for Hudson's special status for
votes. But he knows he loves his community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good town to live in, a good town to do business in,''
he said. ``It's not a crime town, it's a great town.''

AN OLYMPIC-SIZE ETHICAL DILEMMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was loyal to O.J. Simpson after he was charged with double
murder and to broadcaster Marv Albert after he was charged with
sexual assault and sodomy. So it is no shock that network TV
executive Dick Ebersol would stand squarely behind the ethically
challenged International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol, president of NBC Sports, has no problem deciding which
side to choose in a moral dilemma. He sticks with his friends. And
the IOC has been a very good friend, particularly since 1995, when
the sports division won exclusive rights to carry all five Olympics
from 2000 to 2008.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is costing NBC $3.5 billion. And the hefty pricetag
seems reason enough for Ebersol to attack David D'Alessandro, head
of the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., a major Olympic
sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro has spoken up about IOC corruption and called for
more reforms. So it makes perfect business sense for the network to
go after him to protect the value of its Olympic investment.
</P>
<P>
   Continuous headlines about alleged IOC misdeeds threaten to
diminish the amount of money corporations will pay NBC for
advertising during the Games. But is something more _ such as its
longterm exclusive television deal _ driving NBC to protect the
status quo?
</P>
<P>
   After the scandal first broke in January, reports focused on the
secretive dealings of the IOC and its president, Juan Antonio
Samaranch. Specifically regarding NBC, The New York Times reported
on what it termed ``a startling pair of deals.'' The first deal
brought NBC the rights to the Games in Sydney and Salt Lake City;
the second, for the three Olympics after that, ``reversed a bidding
practice begun for the 1988 Olympics in which each network
submitted sealed bids,'' the Times reported.
</P>
<P>
   In reporting those deals, the Times focused on an Israeli named
Alex Giladi, who, the newspaper reported, was an NBC executive
since 1981, an IOC member since 1994, and a confidant of Samaranch.
The Times found no rules against Giladi's arrangement. It was just
. . . interesting. And it could be interesting as well to a
congressional inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop, Ebersol last week accused D'Alessandro of
mounting ``cynical . . . self-serving'' attacks on the IOC. He
called the Hancock executive ``a bully'' who is motivated by ``his
own desire to be on a soapbox'' and charged that his criticisms are
hurting US Olympic athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Those who cover Boston's business community know there is
nothing shy or restrained about D'Alessandro. From his flashy ties
to his flashy quotes, he knows how to make irreverent statements
and seize the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro's criticisms of the IOC are entirely in keeping
with his cocky and calculating image. He knew they would attract
major media attention. After all, he was the only chief executive
of any of the major US companies that spend billions of dollars to
finance the Games to publicly confront the IOC and its scandals.
</P>
<P>
   But here is Ebersol's _ and NBC's _ problem:
</P>
<P>
   The IOC scandals are not hype, spin, or products of David
D'Alessandro's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Ten members of the International Olympic Committee have resigned
or been expelled for conduct related to the awarding of the 2002
Winter Games to Salt Lake City. Some members were accused of
accepting bribes in return for their vote when siting of the Games
was under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   This Sunday, the Salt Lake Tribune reported that six months
after US Attorney General Janet Reno ordered an investigation of
Salt Lake City's Olympic bid, federal prosecutors are headed toward
more indictments.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the scandal is not over. Congressional investigations
have been launched and laws proposed to force more reforms than the
IOC adopted in Lausanne, Switzerland, in March. Why would anyone
want to stop them?
</P>
<P>
   There appears to be a real weakness at the heart of the Olympic
movement _ an all-too-human drive for money and glory. It is
understandable, perhaps; but if it goes unchecked, it corrupts the
Games, the athletes, and all of us.
</P>
<P>
   Network television created the Olympic spirit. It made us
believers in the grace, power, and perseverance of the athletes and
their commitment to sport. The networks count on us to tune into
the thrill of victory, the agony of defeat, and the billions of
dollars of commercial advertising that go with them.
</P>
<P>
   Shouldn't we, in turn, be able to count on honest competition,
on and off the Olympic playing fields? That should be more
important than protecting a television network's assets _ or any
part of a network executive's anatomy.
</P>

WEEKLY ADMITS YUPPIE PROTEST WAS A HOAX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY DELGADO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An alternative weekly newspaper has gleefully
admitted to fabricating a news event and tricking the news media
into covering it.
</P>
<P>
   John Mecklin, editor of the SF Weekly, said he and his staff
created a fake advertisement for a pro-yuppie rally that was to
take place on Sunday afternoon, hoping that the media would take
the bait and cover the nonexistent rally. The phony ad appeared in
the SF Weekly's pages like any other ad, prompting many to believe
that the rally was legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   The city's daily newspapers _ the San Francisco Examiner and the
San Francisco Chronicle _ and several radio and television stations
did cover the rally, which was supposedly to pit affluent yuppies
against longtime residents of the Mission District who did not want
newcomers living in their neighborhood. About 200 people showed up
to protest the ``Stop the Hate'' rally and its supposed yuppie
sponsors. The police were also on hand to monitor the
demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   When the sponsors failed to materialize, the Examiner's Monday
editions covered the event under the headline ``No yups, just nopes
at rally in Mission: Was scheduled anti-hate gathering a complete
put-on?''
</P>
<P>
   Mecklin reveled in the prank, saying it proved that the media
were lazy and would respond to any press release or advertisement
without confirming facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made up a political movement out of thin air, called a
rally on its nonexistent behalf, called into being a large
counterdemonstration, and created a minor media uproar,'' Mecklin
said in an editorial that ran on the Weekly's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the journalism industry criticized the prank as
reckless and irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of journalism is not to lie to people,'' said
Austin Long-Scott, the acting chair of the San Francisco State
University journalism department. ``The purpose of journalism is to
get as close to the truth as possible. ... If (gentrification) is a
big issue in San Francisco, and I think it is, you don't trivialize
it by using it as a prank.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Rogers, metro editor of the San Francisco Examiner, said
newspaper saw the advertisement for the rally, tried unsuccessfully
to verify its authenticity and, in the process, reported two
stories on legitimate gentrification struggles within the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one likes to be duped _ it means you're unwittingly leading
readers down the wrong path,'' Rogers said. ``But it's far worse
when a newspaper like the SF Weekly intentionally tries to pull off
a hoax. That's called lying. If a paper admits to lying, why should
you believe anything else it does?''
</P>
<P>
   Mecklin vowed to continue creating pranks that are ``good for
the mental health of the city,'' but said his readers were smart
enough not to be confused by them.
</P>
<P>
   ``These (pranks) happen for a reason. They are meant to
illuminate a facet of life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Phony rally aside, reporters focused attention on the very real
tension created by gentrification in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The economic boom in the San Francisco Bay area and a shortage
of housing have caused prices for homes and apartments to soar,
pitting working-class people against the more affluent in a
competition for housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mission District is deeply divided between people
struggling to keep a roof over their heads and people desperately
looking for a place to buy a home,'' Rogers said. ``It's too bad
the Weekly trivialized the situation with a cheap publicity
stunt.''
</P>
<P>
   The SF Weekly is owned by New Times Inc., which also has
alternative newsweeklies in Broward-Palm Beach, Cleveland, Dallas,
Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, Phoenix and St. Louis.

THE HEART OF PUERTO RICO'S CAPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM A. DAVIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN _ Old San Juan really is. Almost ancient in fact.
</P>
<P>
   The walled town at the heart of Puerto Rico's capital was
founded by the Spaniards in 1521, a century before the Pilgrims
landed on Plymouth Rock. This makes Old San Juan practically
medieval by New World standards. Happily, it carries the nearly
five centuries lightly and is a lively neighborhood, not a museum
village.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan San Juan is a study in contemporary urban sprawl,
like so many American cities, but the original fortified settlement
_ rimmed by 40-foot-high walls and guarded by two great forts _ is
the essence of compactness. Laid out to a precise formal plan
mandated by Spanish colonial authorities in Madrid, Old San Juan
crams a lot of history and considerable charm into a mere seven
square blocks.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 400 restored buildings, including churches,
public buildings, and private mansions: the greatest such
concentration in the Caribbean. There are also monuments, city
gates, sculptured fountains, plazas (frequently used for al fresco
concerts and dances), and hidden gardens. Some of the best
restaurants in the city _ or in all of Puerto Rico, for that matter
_ can be found in the old town, along with some of the liveliest
bars and lounges and most fashionable shops and boutiques.
</P>
<P>
   You can see most of Old San Juan's major sights in a couple of
hours. But it lavishly rewards leisurely strolling and casual
poking around. If a cobblestone street, flower-filled park or shady
courtyard looks interesting, chances are it is.
</P>
<P>
   There are several approaches to Old San Juan, but unquestionably
the most scenic and atmospheric is along Paseo La Princesa. A
harborside promenade, the paseo _ scene of an open-air arts and
crafts market on weekends _ leads from the dock area, where cruise
ships tie up, to the formidable 17th-century San Juan gate. For
centuries this gate was the main entrance to the old town, and it
still retains the original massive iron-studded defensive doors,
now never closed.
</P>
<P>
   Passing through the San Juan gate, the scenic promenade
continues along the walls past La Fortaleza, built in the 16th
century for Spanish officials and still the residence of Puerto
Rico's governor. It continues through Plazuela de la Rogativa, a
small square with an unusual monument depicting a religious
procession that unexpectedly delivered the city from a siege in the
18th century. Thinking the procession along the city walls _
actually, a group of torch-carrying women led by an elderly bishop
_ must be a relief force, the British Navy hastily withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   The harborside fortifications end at San Felipe del Morro, the
great stone fort guarding the entrance to the port. A similar
bastion, San Cristobal, defends the land side. Both have
watchtowers, deep dungeons, and powder magazines as well as
historical exhibits. El Morro, however, definitely offers the best
view of the two, a panorama that takes in the harbor and all of Old
San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   Also a striking example of military architecture is Cuartel
Ballaja, the former Spanish military headquarters. Built around a
central barracks square, the enormous building, largest erected in
the Americas by Spanish army engineers, originally housed soldiers
and their families.  &UR; Today &LR; , it contains the Museum of the
Americas, which displays a superb collection of arts and crafts
from all over the Western Hemisphere. Particulary interesting are
the many colorful ``santos,'' religious figures that are a
distinctively Puerto Rican handicraft.
</P>
<P>
   Another museum, housed in a small 18th-century house on Calle
San Sebastian, is a memorial to the late, great cellist Pablo
Casals. An exile from Franco's Spain, Casals long made his home in
Puerto Rico and founded a prestigious annual music festival. The
great man's beloved cello is here, along with photographs,
manuscripts, and other memorabilia. You can also watch (and hear)
videotapes of some of his finest performances.
</P>
<P>
   Adjacent to the Casals Museum is Casa de Los Contrafuertes
(``House of the Buttresses''), dating from the early 1500s and the
oldest residential building in Old San Juan. It contains both a
small pharmacy museum and a graphics arts museum.
</P>
<P>
   As was usually the case in Spanish colonial towns, an imposing
cathedral is one of the focal points of Old San Juan. A church has
stood on the same spot on Calle del Christo since 1529. The present
church incorporates the remains of earlier ones, destroyed by fires
and hurricanes and plundered by invaders, and is mostly 19th
century. Normally quiet and dignified, the cathedral really jumps
on Sundays at 11 a.m. That's the ``Salsa Mass,'' when the whole
congregation sings, shouts, swings, and sways to a pulsing Latino
beat.
</P>
<P>
   The body of Puerto Rico's first governor Ponce de Leon, killed
by an Indian arrow while looking for the Fountain of Youth in
Florida, now rests in an ornate marble tomb in the transept of the
cathedral. There is a statue of him, made from melted-down cannon
captured from the British, nearby in plaza San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Space is tight within the confining walls of old San Juan but
the town plan designated a number of plazas and squares for public
assembly, from military tattoos to holy day fiestas. These days,
these precious open spaces are often the scene of jazz concerts,
teen dances, and chamber music performances. Largest and most
impressive of Old San Juan's plazas are Plaza de Armas, the
original town square, which has a lovely 19th-century fountain
representing the four seasons; Plaza Colon, dominated by a pillar
topped with a statue of Christopher Columbus (Cristobal Colon in
Spanish); and, Quincentennial Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Located on the highest point of the old town, Quincentennial
Plaza commemorates the discovery of the New World in 1492 and the
500-year-old history of Puerto Rico. The plaza's symbolic
centerpiece is a 40-foot-high totemic sculpture in black granite
and ceramic by local artist Jaime Suarez that symbolizes the
earthen and clay roots of American history. Also decorating the
plaza are fountains, other columns, and sculpted steps.
</P>
<P>
   There are two notable places to stay in the heart of Old San
Juan, both occupying characterful restored buildings.
</P>
<P>
   A deluxe 61-room hotel, El Convento, which stands across from
the cathedral, was built in the mid 17th century as a Carmelite
convent. Eventually abandoned by the nuns, it deteriorated into a
shabby rooming house and was almost demolished. Its restoration in
the 1960s was one of the turning points in the revitalization (and
gentrification) of Old San Juan, which became a colorful near-slum
when the modern city expanded outside the old walls.
</P>
<P>
   El Convento had another multimillion dollar makeover a few years
ago _ rooms now are decorated with hand-made tiles and period
furnishings imported from Spain _ and is one of the island's top
hotels. The hotel's several lounges and restaurants are popular
hangouts for the young professionals who are rapidly transforming
Old San Juan into one of the city's most fashionable residential
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The Gallery Inn on Calle Norzagaray is a cheery survivor from
the days when Old San Juan had more in common with Greenwich
Village than Greenwich, Conn. Jan D'Esopa, a Connecticut born
sculptress and painter, and her husband, Manuco Gandia, opened the
inn _ the only B &AMP; B in the old town _ in the early 1960s. It has
expanded over the years and now occupies four adjacent buildings,
all dating to early colonial days and connected by flowery and
vine-shaded courtyards filled with D'Esopa's idiosyncratic
sculptures and paintings.
</P>
<P>
   There is no dining room or swimming pool but the Gallery Inn has
a roof deck with a sweeping view. Other amenities include an art
gallery, a foundry for casting sculptures, and a framing shop.
Guests have the run of the place, as do the three resident parrots.
</P>
<P>
   The 25 rooms range from grandly old fashioned to funky and
distinctly odd. For instance, in one small and windowless guest
room, a former wine cellar, D'Esopa has tried to compensate for the
lack of apertures by covering an entire wall with a mural depicting
the harbor on a sunny day.
</P>
<P>
   Old San Juan has become a real restaurant quarter in recent
years and has something to offer for most taste buds and
pocketbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Among the restaurants providing a distinctively Puerto Rican
dining experience is the Parrot Club on Calle Fortaleza, which
calls its cuisine ``Nuevo Latino,'' exemplified by such dishes as
pan-seared tuna in rum sauce. Amadeus on Calle Sebastian, open only
for lunch, occcupies an 18th-century former mansion and is known
for giving an international twist to local ingredients, as with
arrowroot fritters and dumplings in guava sauce.
</P>
<P>
   El Patio de Sam on Calle San Sebastian is the restaurant
equivalent of the Gallery Inn, a longtime hangout for expatriates,
Bohemians, and neighborhood folks of all sorts. Burgers are the
specialty, but they're served with typically Caribbean side dishes
such as fried plaintains. The dining room has so many plants it
resembles a rain forest, and there is usually a guitarist playing
evenings.
</P>
<P>
   Uniquely Caribbean is the Butterfly People Cafe on Calle
Fortaleza, which specializes in light fare, particularly dishes
involving tropical fruits. The cafe is connected to the gallery of
the same name, which boasts the world's largest collection of
framed butterflies. Like the gallery, the walls of the cafe are
also covered with brilliantly colored butterflies. And, if you just
want a good cafe con leche and maybe a piece of homemade pastry,
try La Bombonera on Calle San Francisco, a local institution since
1902.

ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN (AND DOES) AT MTV MOVIE AWARDS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Twinkies, Tootsie Rolls and (BEGIN
ITALICS)Kudrows?(END ITALICS)
</P>
<P>
   You can't help doing a double take as you pass a catering table
backstage at rehearsals for the 1999 MTV Movie Awards. The cable
music channel sure knows how to treat ``Friends'' star and show
host Lisa Kudrow, you think to yourself. They've even had a candy
bar named after her.
</P>
<P>
   Upon closer inspection, though, the candy turns out to be (BEGIN
ITALICS)Kudos(END ITALICS). Just the same, MTV knows how to keep
the help happy.
</P>
<P>
   The annual MTV Movie Awards _ consisting of such off-the-wall
categories as best kiss, best villain, best fight and best action
sequence _ are the evil stepchild of the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   The unconventional program, which airs at 9 p.m. Thursday, keeps
its crown as the most entertaining awards show on television,
allowing Hollywood's Gen X royalty to let its hair down. You never
know what's going to happen, or who will turn up at the last minute
_ such as this year's appearance on stage by a Jim Morrison
look-alike.
</P>
<P>
   To see how preparations went for the star-studded, comedic
event, we spent a long day attending rehearsals for the awards,
which were taped Saturday at Santa Monica Airport's Barker Hangar.
</P>
<P>
   9:30 a.m.: We talk to Joel Gallen, producer of the eighth annual
awards show. ``You never know what someone's going to say when they
win an award,'' he says. ``People are coming to a party where
anything can happen. They're coming for a good time whether they
win or lose. The audience that watches the show is the most
important demographic to Hollywood. These are the moviegoers that
make or break a movie. They decide if it's going to be a
blockbuster.'' In fact, after Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes of
``Shakespeare in Love'' were nominated in MTV's best kiss category,
the nod was trumpeted in the movie's ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   10:35 a.m. &UR; : &LR;  Kudrow enters stage left through a fake rock
formation, walks to microphone and gets as far as ``Welcome ...''
when a tech stops her and she walks off stage.
</P>
<P>
   10:37 a.m. &UR; : &LR;  The hangar is a hive of activity as techs, grips
and stagehands check equipment and attend to props. Rows near the
front have placards placed on chairs reading James Van Der Beek,
Will Smith, Courtney Love, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Catherine
Zeta-Jones, Hugh Grant, Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Ben Affleck and
other stars.
</P>
<P>
   10:45 a.m. &UR; : &LR;  Audio techs with fishpole mikes kneel down out of
the way of cameras.
</P>
<P>
   10:50 a.m. &UR; : &LR;  Kudrow emerges and sits on stage as a tech wheels
over a tank of oxygen. Kudrow takes a few hits.
</P>
<P>
   10:52 a.m. &UR; : &LR;  Kudrow is announced again and enters to scattered
applause. ``Hi,'' she begins. ``I'm very excited about this set.
It's cozy. I know all this by heart so I don't need the
TelePrompTer (which wasn't working).'' Kudrow, feeling the effects
of a cold, coughs.
</P>
<P>
   11 a.m. &UR; : &LR;  Kudrow rehearses her entrance again. Takes scripted
questions from techs standing in for audience members.
</P>
<P>
   11:15 a.m. &UR; : &LR;  Kudrow goes off stage, the lights go down, and a
large wooden circle is wheeled down the aisle for some unexplained
reason.
</P>
<P>
   Noon: Kudrow comes outside to talk to press. A security escort,
the size of a small house, stands behind her. ``I've never done
this before,'' she says of hosting the movie awards. ``The
difference between this and `Friends' is, you rehearse `Friends.'
''
</P>
<P>
   12:16 p.m.: Matt Pinfield, the chrome-domed, troll-like MTV VJ,
interviews Kudrow as MTV assistants hold cue cards that say things
like, ``Thanks, Carson.'' Because the outdoors area where Kudrow is
standing is next to the Santa Monica airport runway, a Lear jet
roars by, and the MTV sound crew, wearing sensitive headphones,
winces.
</P>
<P>
   12:27 p.m.: Cast and crew at lunch. Catering includes
make-your-own peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, bagels and cream
cheese, muffins, coffee and plenty of sweets _ Twinkies, Tootsie
Rolls, M&AMP;Ms, red licorice.
</P>
<P>
   12:55 p.m.: Techs paint sets as a huge orange cherry picker
moves down the main aisle. Two lighting grips are lifted skyward.
</P>
<P>
   1:10 p.m.: Cast and crew mingle outdoors, snack on what one crew
member describes as ``gerbil food.'' She holds up a Twinkie:
``There's plenty of nutrition in this.''
</P>
<P>
   1:25 p.m.: Brit pop star Robbie Williams preens, paces and
smokes outside.
</P>
<P>
   1:40 p.m.: Williams' roadies grab instruments and check sound
levels. ``Take some 800 out of this,'' one guy shouts to the sound
tech.
</P>
<P>
   1:46 p.m.: Williams' drummer, pounding away at full volume,
begins hitting a full-size gong behind him.
</P>
<P>
   1:50 p.m.: Keyboard player subjects us to blaring sample of the
``James Bond'' theme over and over.
</P>
<P>
   1:52 p.m.: Weedy Brit guitarist in spectacles and Superman
T-shirt grabs his instrument and plays some simple chords with grim
determination.
</P>
<P>
   2 p.m.: We begin silently praying one of the boom cams knocks
the guitarist off stage.
</P>
<P>
   2:05 p.m.: Cellos arrive. The players immediately place hands
over ears.
</P>
<P>
   2:10 p.m.: A dozen scantily clad Bond girls drape themselves
over the stage. This is suddenly getting interesting. A Williams
roadie leans over, motioning toward one of the dancers: ``I
wouldn't mind wrestling in Jell-O with her.''
</P>
<P>
   2:30 p.m.: Williams and band launch into the hit ``Millennium,''
and it sounds fantastic.
</P>
<P>
   2:50 p.m.: Choreographer Toni Basil rehearses her dancers with
Williams, who notices his own image broadcast on a giant screen
above him. ``I love you,'' he mouths at himself.
</P>
<P>
   3 p.m.: Dance rehearsal continues.
</P>
<P>
   4 p.m.: Will Smith rehearsal closed. We leave.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday _ night of show.
</P>
<P>
   At the two-hour event, ``There's Something About Mary'' receives
four awards: best movie, best actress, best villain and best fight.
</P>
<P>
   Those in the pressroom had two questions for the few stars who
made their way backstage: ``What did you think of the new `Star
Wars' film?'' and ``Where are you gonna put your award?''
</P>
<P>
   The media area is a curious mixture of legitimate reporters,
online geeks and obvious fakes, like the guy next to me who claimed
he was from Rolling Stone but took no notes and didn't seem to know
anything about the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Presenter Courtney Love makes her way backstage, uninvited and
evidently unwanted.
</P>
<P>
   Her first words: ``Why do you guys want to talk to me? I didn't
win anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the sound on the backstage TV monitors are periodically
turned off, many of us miss the announcement that Jim Carrey has
won best male performance for ``The Truman Show.''
</P>
<P>
   So, when Carrey walked to the podium as Jim Morrison in
longhaired wig, beard, wire-rimmed glasses and psychedelic T-shirt,
and launched into a rambling, profanity-laced acceptance speech,
some of us didn't know who he was.
</P>
<P>
   MTV said it would bleep the bad words during Thursday's
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   The show also featured parodies of ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The
Phantom Menace,'' and Kudrow and teen-pop boy band 'N Sync
re-enacting the animal cracker scene from ``Armageddon.''
</P>
<P>
   Winners included Cameron Diaz for best female performance in
``Mary''; Ben Stiller for best fight in ``Mary,'' an award shared
with Puffy the Dog; Adam Sandler for best comedic performance in
``The Waterboy''; Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan for best on-screen
duo in ``Rush Hour''; Matt Dillon in ``Mary'' and Stephen Dorff in
``Blade'' tied for best villain; Paltrow and Fiennes for best kiss
in ``Shakespeare''; and Guy Ritchie for best new filmmaker for
``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.''
</P>
<P>
   Brit filmmaker Ritchie was in fine form backstage, crowing that
he was seated in back of `Heather somebody (Graham) from `Boogie
Nights' and she's fit as the butcher's dog, as they say.'' Asked by
a fellow Londoner how Madonna might rank on the ``butcher's dog
scale,'' Ritchie quickly made his excuses and left the podium. &UR;  &QL;

A SEXY, SINEWY SOJOURN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
TIPPING THE VELVET 
By Sarah Waters 
Riverhead, 472 pp., $25.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With her glorious first novel, Sarah Waters achieves the kind of
exceptional debut most novice writers can barely imagine, let alone
accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tipping the Velvet'' is a sexy, sinewy sojourn of a young
woman in turn-of-the-century England. This is a shade of those
well-documented times rarely seen, far from those gentle
coming-of-age stories or drawing-room comedies, replete with
stifled, veiled emotions. Waters shakes the dust off Victorian
England, reveling in its bawdiness, and revealing its sassy,
sensuous soul.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the book is Nancy Astley, who narrates the
story. Unfolding as a reminiscence, her tale begins in 1888 when
she worked in her family's oyster parlor. By her own description,
she was ``a slender, white-faced, unremarkable-looking girl, with
the sleeves of her dress rolled up to her elbows, and a lock of
lank and colourless hair forever falling into her eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother would often say Nancy was found as a baby in an
oyster shell, saved from a hungry customer. It was a family joke,
but there was a hint of truth there. All of Nancy's 18 years had
been spent among oysters, working 12-hour days delicately removing
natives from their shells. It was not a life that dissatisfied her.
Her sister Alice was her best friend, and ``for eight-een years,''
Nancy recalls, ``I . . . never looked far beyond my father's
kitchen for occupation, or for love.''
</P>
<P>
   At least, that is, until she meets Miss Kitty Butler, star at
the Canterbury Palace of Varieties.
</P>
<P>
   The Palace, as locals called it, was a 15-minute train ride and
a world away from Nancy's coastal Whitstable home. It was a shabby
music hall, but in Nancy's eyes it was a slice of paradise with its
jaunty rhythms, slyly suggestive songs, and curvaceous painted
ladies. Amid the smoke and scent of wood and greasepaint, Nancy
first spied Miss Kitty, who owned a stage the minute she sauntered
across it.
</P>
<P>
   Waters's writing is plush and inviting _ delicious, even _ when
Nancy first sees Kitty. Clad in a man's suit, Kitty performs as a
West End swell, boyishly beautiful in her 2-inch stand-up collar,
bow tie, and rose in her lapel. But it is Kitty's hair, ``the kind
of brown you might hear sung about,'' which does something
frightening and fabulous to Nancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had ever seen women with hair as short as hers, it was
because they had spent time in hospital or prison; or because they
were mad. They could never look like Kitty. . . . It curled at her
temple, slightly, and over her ears; when she turned her head a
little to put her hat back on, I saw a strip of pale flesh at the
nape of her neck where the collar ended and the hairline began that
_ for all the fire of that hot, hot hall _ made me shiver.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy is instantly smitten with Kitty, and is soon making
regular trips to see her perform. Before long she becomes Kitty's
dresser and confidante, and soon Kitty's lover. Eventually, Nancy
succumbs to the lure of the lights and applause, and finds herself
singing and performing _ also in men's clothing _ as Nan King. This
is merely the beginning of Nan's colorful journey.
</P>
<P>
   At 472 pages, could the novel be shorter? Perhaps, but what
would be eliminated? Certainly, not Nan's experiences as a ``rent
boy'' or her ill-advised affair with Diana Lethaby, a wealthy widow
who ``keeps'' Nan for her own sexual high jinks. Given its heft,
the book still manages to be a fairly breezy read.
</P>
<P>
   Because ``Tipping the Velvet'' features several love affairs
between women, some will characterize this as a lesbian novel. To
be sure, in this book, the love that dare not speak its name almost
never shuts up. The novel has also drawn some comparisons to
Jeanette Winterson's ``Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit,'' another
novel with an English girl on the cusp of womanhood leaving her
dour surroundings to discover her true sexual self.
</P>
<P>
   But with respect to Winterson's classic, ``Tipping the Velvet''
is a more expansive, adventuresome book. And while describing it as
a lesbian novel may be somewhat accurate, the term is too limited
in portraying the many charms of Waters's layered work. There are
several stories here _ lesbian love, the bumpkin swept into the
hustle-bustle of the big city, a young woman discovering herself as
life takes awkward, unexpected turns _ and Waters juggles each with
panache. Capturing the era in all its naughty, garish glory, Waters
celebrates everything that made the Nineties _ the 1890s _ so
unabashedly gay.

TAKE A STROLL IN THE CITY OF TRAILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston is a city of trails. There are, of course, the Freedom
Trail and the Black Heritage Trail. But there are others as well,
some for walking and others for driving. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   --The GeoTrail. This takes visitors to Boston construction,
including America's biggest road project, the multibillion-dollar
Big Dig, scheduled to be finished in early 2005. Or so they say.
</P>
<P>
   --The Emerald Necklace Trail. Bearing the magic touch of
landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, this trail connects the
first park system in America and features gardens, greenhouses, a
zoo, walkways, a bike trail, and a rose garden.
</P>
<P>
   --The Women's Heritage Trail. Said to be the only one of its
kind, this one celebrates four centuries of achievements by women
and includes sites associated with publishers, suffragettes, and
poets.
</P>
<P>
   --The Boston Literary Trail. This lifts some of America's most
beloved authors, including Louisa May Alcott, Henry David Thoreau,
and Edgar Allan Poe, out of the pages of their books and gives
insight into their lives.
</P>
<P>
   These trails begin at, or close to, the revamped Boston Common
Visitor Center, which is open daily and has brochures and trail
maps, as well as guidebooks for purchase. For more information,
call 888-SEE-BOSTON or visit www.bostonusa.com.
</P>
<P>
   Travel Trivia: What state capital has three sets of double
letters? (Answer at end of column.)
</P>
<P>
   Quotable: ``People in America are always telling me, `I love
your accent.' Ah, but when I go to Boston, I get to tell them, `I
love your accent.' '' _ a visitor from Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Grave moments: ``Tales, Tombs &AMP; Gravestones'' is a new nighttime
trolley excursion that takes guests on a two-hour ``frightseeing''
tour of Boston's scary sights. Conductors and actors sprinkle their
stories with humor and offer rare information, like the weight of a
ghostly spirit and how many whacks Lizzie Borden allegedly gave her
parents with an ax. The jaunt is presented by Historic Tours of
America, via Minuteman Tours, Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays at
8 p.m. beginning June 24. Price is $30 for adults and $18 for
children, and tours are by reservation only. Call 617-269-3626.
</P>
<P>
   On the menu: The Parish Cafe and Bar on Boylston Street in
Boston is unique in that its menu pays tribute to some of the
area's most prominent chefs and restaurants. Example: the Lydia, a
lobster salad dish created by Lydia Shire, chef/owner of Biba and
Pignoli in Boston; the Spicy Salamander, an eggplant concoction
created by Stan Frankenthaler, chef/owner of Salamander in
Cambridge; and the Pudding Portobello sandwich, created by Debra
Hughes, chef/owner of Upstairs at the Pudding in Cambridge. And the
Guinness is well-poured!
</P>
<P>
   Come to the cabaret: On the site of Benjamin Franklin's
birthplace, Dr. Franklin, along with Colonial Friends and
Musicians, create the essence of a colonial cabaret ``to lift the
spirits of weary citizens with musicks and merrymaking.'' Franklin
is portrayed lovingly and accurately by two-time Emmy-winner Bill
Meikle, and audience participation is encouraged. From July 2
through Sept. 4, the cabaret takes places Fridays and Saturdays at
8 p.m. in the Great Room of the International Institute of Boston,
1 Milk St. Tickets are $20. Call 781-648-0628 for reservations, and
ask also about colonial Boston walks and lunch with Dr. Franklin or
Abigail Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Planes, trains, etc.: The Boston University Bridge is said to be
the only place in the world where a boat can sail under a train
driving under a car driving under an airplane. (With thanks to
uselessfacts.net via faithful contributor Mike Schuster of
Foxborough, Mass.)
</P>
<P>
   Ye olde football: The Oneida Football Club, the first such
organized club in the country, practiced on Boston Common between
1862 and 1865. Many call the games there the beginnings of modern
American football.
</P>
<P>
   Did you guess it? Tallahassee, Fla. (You thought it was
Bossttonn?) We thank Sal Chancholo of Medford, Mass., for the
question.

 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOWELL, Mass. _ The old office is empty on the 14th floor of the
former Wang Laboratories tower, where John Thibault once addressed
his boss, ``Dr. Wang,'' about the day's business.
</P>
<P>
   But one floor below, 10 years later, Thibault has built a
technology empire of his own. Geotel Communications Corp.'s offices
whir with personal computers as 300 employees design the software
used by American Express, Fidelity Investments, and the nation's
major airlines to route customer calls.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, Thibault and Geotel's other founders received the
ultimate endorsement of their success: Cisco Systems Inc., the
nation's largest computer networking company, agreed to buy their
5-year-old firm for $1.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of upheaval, in which the giants of the high-tech
community in Massachusetts have faded away, a new generation of
companies like Geotel has risen to take their place. Unlike their
predecessors, which staked their fortunes on making computers, the
hundreds of start-ups that now dominate the state's high-tech
landscape are selling software rather than hardware and ideas and
services rather than products.
</P>
<P>
   They are, to a large extent, creatures of new technologies,
especially the Internet. Many are small ventures, with only a
handful of employees. Most will never approach the size of Wang or
Digital Equipment Corp., the once-giant companies synonymous with
the Route 128 culture of the 1980s. Instead, like Geotel, many are
being acquired when they are only a few years old by larger
companies hungry for their innovations.
</P>
<P>
   As these new companies have flourished, they have created a
high-tech economy that is far broader than it was a decade ago,
with a dozen or so sectors ranging from telecommunications to
Internet software development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Massachusetts has probably the most diverse set of high-tech
companies in the country,'' said Sara Johnson, an economist and
former member of the state Council on Economic Growth and
Technology. ``Most other tech centers are focused on one or two
industry clusters. We have them all.''
</P>
<P>
   And these high-tech companies have also been a major force in
propelling growth in a variety of industries from financial
services to medicine, driving employment to record levels in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers help illuminate the transformation of the high-tech
industry in Massachusetts:
</P>
<P>
   --Employment in software and Internet companies jumped 75
percent from 1992 through 1997, to 68,983 jobs from 39,501 jobs,
according to a study by the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative,
a privately funded research group. During the prior five years, the
gain was a modest 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --Massachusetts is now home to some 2,751 software companies, up
from 800 in 1989, according to the Massachusetts Software Council,
a trade organization.
</P>
<P>
   --About half of the high-tech workers in the state hold
nonmanufacturing jobs, a shift from 1988 when more than two-thirds
of the technology work force was employed by manufacturers,
according to the state's Department of Employment and Training.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic changes in the high-tech industry are being driven
by a new generation of entrepreneurs and engineers, many of whom
were educated in Boston and stayed after graduation. Some left jobs
at Wang, Digital and other established companies to start anew.
They are taking advantage of a wave of capital generated by a
booming stock market and a so-far unwavering belief that the
Internet is transforming the US economy.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, venture capital firms poured a record $141 million a
month into fledgling Massachusetts companies, according to the
accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. The total of $1.7 billion
invested last year was more than triple 1995's investment of $470
million.
</P>
<P>
   The ventures started with this money epitomize a new high-tech
culture where employees seem animated by ideas more than loyalty to
any one company. Ken Lang, the chief technology officer for Lycos
Inc., the state's most prominent Internet company, put it simply:
``I don't think there are 1950s company men any more, especially in
the Internet industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Lang's path to Waltham-based Lycos, an Internet search service,
began after he graduated from Duke with a quadruple major in
physics, computer science, math and engineering. He quit work on a
doctorate in artificial intelligence, on the advice of his
professor and Lycos founder Michael Mauldin, and started WiseWire,
which compiles profiles of Internet users. Last year, Lycos bought
WiseWire _ and hired Lang.
</P>
<P>
   Two walls of Lang's office are whiteboards covered with a
magic-marker rainbow of diagrams of ``mind-blowing'' ideas for new
products, including a game site and an interactive Web site. He
sees his job as not just designing products but as shaping the
World Wide Web's future. ``When you're stepping into areas nobody
has stepped into before, it's up to you to decide what the future
is like,'' Lang said.
</P>
<P>
   While other Massachusetts high-tech companies have become
national names _ EMC Corp. in Franklin, for example, has become the
dominant maker of computer-storage systems _ most remain largely
unknown, with mysterious sounding names like Altiga Networks,
Sapient, and Dragon Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Often, they are nearly invisible because they focus on
``under-the-hood'' software or services used by other businesses.
Many are start-ups barely off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Five months ago, Tom Leighton, a math professor at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and one of his students, Dan
Lewin, started Akamai Technologies Inc. in Cambridge's Kendall
Square, a high-tech mecca. The pair are using mathematics in an
attempt to solve a vexing problem on the Internet: system crashes
like the one that occurred when millions of users tried to visit a
Victoria's Secret fashion show that was advertised during last
year's Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Dolce, chief executive of Redstone Communications Inc. in
Westford, compared the Internet to the Industrial Revolution of a
century ago. His company _ and others clustered along Interstate
495 _ is developing technology to enable telephone, cable, and
computer companies to handle the exponential growth in the amount
of data moving through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet ``has changed from a toy _ an entertainment device
_ to a real business tool,'' Dolce said. ``No one realizes  &UR; today &LR; 
the kind of impact this will have in the next five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the Internet, the breathtaking expansion of the
technology sector in Massachusetts has grown to encompass other
businesses. The state is experiencing a boom, for example, in
computer consulting companies, such as Cambridge Technology
Partners and Sapient, that help clients update computers and
software systems. Boston has become a center for the design and
sale of interactive CD-ROMs for education and business, an industry
that didn't even exist 10 years ago. And increased use of computer
technology over the past decade has driven innovations and growth
by medical device companies in the state.
</P>
<P>
   These changes and more have created a high-tech economy that is
much different from a decade ago when high tech meant one thing:
manufacturing. The computer giants that fueled the high-tech boom
in the 1980s, such as Digital and Wang, failed to keep up with the
PC revolution. As computer manufacturing headed south, these giants
suffered massive layoffs that devastated the state's entire
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1990, said Craig Moore, an economics professor at
University of Massachusetts at Amherst, ``a lot of economists were
saying, `Did we just go over the precipice?' It was devastating. ''
But, the economy  &UR; today &LR;  ``doesn't look anything like it did in
1990,'' he added. ``We now have 10 or 12 major industries (in
high-tech) that have grown and flourished.''
</P>
<P>
   While the industry has successfully remade itself, some of the
high-tech jobs that were lost in the late 1980s and early 1990s
still have not been replaced. According to the Massachusetts
Division of Employment and Training, 303,300 residents work in the
high tech industry _ 31,900 fewer than in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard deKaser, an economist for BankBoston Corp., stressed
that these numbers are based on old and outmoded ways of measuring
high-tech employment. The impact of the booming industry goes far
beyond companies counted as high-tech concerns by the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The employment numbers tend to underrepresent the importance
of the industry'' to the state's economy, DeKaser said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the high-tech transformation has brought lasting changes
to Massachusetts' work force and has spilled into businesses as
seemingly unrelated to the industry as financial services.
</P>
<P>
   At State Street Bank &AMP; Trust Co.'s computer operation in Quincy,
Herbert Clark oversees a state-of-the art system that tracks $4.8
trillion in investment dollars as closely as NASA tracks a space
flight. Clark, who grew up in Braintree and attended Blue Hills
Technical College, clearly prefers this challenging job to his
previous job in the checking-processing department of a bank,
because ``the technology's constantly changing.''
</P>
<P>
   The transformation in the high-tech sector has also forced
employees of the old economy to change with it.
</P>
<P>
   Workers such as Bob O'Brien, 46, have been retrained after years
of joblessness. Laid off by Wang in 1990, O'Brien said he is just
as busy now working in EMC's immaculate huge new plant in Franklin,
where data-storage computers are tested in a steamy tropical room,
a ``cool room,'' and a ``vibrating room.''
</P>
<P>
   While O'Brien has benefited from a surge in EMC's employment to
3,800 currently _ and 1,200 more will be hired this year _ his
memories of the 1980s bust still sting: ``The whole world stopped
spinning,'' he recalled.

 IT ALL CAUGHT UP TO CHARISMATIC
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Like a true warrior, Charismatic went out on his shield. In a
game designed for flying aces, he was a foot soldier, and he
accomplished all he could.
</P>
<P>
   The dream of Charismatic becoming the first claimer to win the
Triple Crown ended approaching the eighth-pole of the Belmont Park
stretch Saturday, when Charismatic ran out of gas. The fact that he
fought so hard to resist defeat, fracturing his left leg in the
process, is a tribute to the ``fat'' horse whose heart is as big as
his body.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen Selway, who performed surgery on Charismatic's leg
Sunday, believed the cannon bone fracture happened in the final
furlong, which is where Charismatic was passed, and the sesamoids
fractured as he tried to go on.
</P>
<P>
   Although the term is popular in racing, there is no such thing
as an ``iron horse.'' Thoroughbreds are made of flesh, and blood,
and bones that can break. The Charismatic camp can spin the story
any way they want, but there is no question he was overraced. He
wasn't overraced just recently, he was overraced throughout his
career. Beginning with the Santa Anita Derby April 3, he ran in
five major stakes races in nine weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But Charismatic also ran seven times as a 2-year-old, and the
Belmont was his 17th career start. He lost five straight maiden
special weight races at the beginning of his career, and did not
win until he was put in a $62,500 maiden claimer. He then lost
three more starts until he was placed first via disqualification in
a $62,500 claimer for 3-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   His connections ran him a lot in an attempt to win purse money
to cut their losses, because he cost $200,000 and they thought he
was a bust. A stakes horse can win $200,000 in one Grade III race.
No one can ever know whether running 17 times from June 20, 1998,
to June 5, 1999, contributed to the breaking of his leg. He might
have taken just one bad step, but the record remains the record.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic retires with a career record of 17-5-2-3. Compare
that with the career record of Affirmed, who won the Triple Crown
in 1978, the last to do so. Affirmed ran 29 times and won 22. He
was second five times, third once, and off the board once. When he
lost, he lost to opponents such as Alydar, Seattle Slew, and
Exceller. Affirmed, both a 2-year-old champion and a handicap
champion, was born to be a great racehorse. Charismatic, whose
owner didn't want him as recently as February, was a classic
overachiever. The horses weren't just on different planes, they
were practically on different planets.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic was not meant to be a Top Gun. He was a ground
trooper who reached for the sky. And that's not a bad way to be
remembered.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Overlooked stars
</P>
<P>
   The unfortunate injury to Charismatic stole much of the thunder
from the Belmont victory of 29-1 shot Lemon Drop Kid. Vision and
Verse, who was beaten by just a head at 54-1, also received scant
attention. These are two fresh horses in top hands, and it is
likely they will be heard from again.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon Drop Kid, a son of Kingmambo, who is by the late Mr.
Prospector, was considered a top 2-year-old when he won the Belmont
Futurity last September. He ran second in the Champagne, to none
other then Rick Pitino's The Groom Is Red, but disappointed in the
Breeders' Cup, finishing fifth. He bounced back by winning his
sophomore debut in a Gulfstream allowance, but he slipped from view
when he ran poorly in the Blue Grass, in which he was only 4-1, and
the Kentucky Derby. He then improved by running third in the Peter
Pan at Belmont, his Belmont Stakes prep.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that Lemon Drop Kid is a horse for a
course, a lover of Belmont Park, with a 5-2-2-1 record over
America's only 12-furlong oval. But, to his credit, veteran
conditioner Scotty Schulhofer said from the outset that Lemon Drop
Kid was the best horse he had ever trained, and Schulhofer has
trained some good ones, including Cryptoclearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just needed a little time to grow up, he's a May 28 foal,''
said Schulhofer. ``He peaked on the right day. We're going to give
him a nice, long rest and probably see about the Jim Dandy (Aug. 8
at Saratoga) and the Travers (Aug. 28), for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Vision and Verse, a son of Storm Cat, is a late developer who
raced only once as a 2-year-old. He came to prominence by wining
the Illinois Derby at Hawthorne May 8 and is trained by Bill Mott,
one of the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was doing super coming into the race, and it unfolded
nicely for him,'' said Mott, who is pointing Vision and Verse to
the Jim Dandy and Travers, as well. ``He was dead game in the
stretch, and I thought we were going to get there.''

ADVICE UNHEEDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Less than two weeks ago, the ``consensus'' around
here had decided that the indictment for war crimes of Slobodan
Milosevic by the international tribunal in The Hague was just about
the worst thing that could have happened.
</P>
<P>
   It was bound to mess up the chances for a quick resolution of
the Kosovo mess, we were told. Facing the klink, Milosevic was
certain to dig in even deeper. And, of course, as long as his
shrinking domain was facing attacks ``only'' from above, a
dictator's ability to hold on was by conventional definition
indefinite because bombing could never resolve a situation on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   I remember attempting at the time to determine if there was some
basis for all this certainty from the twin commentariats of think
tank and media muse and concluding that it was all coming out of
thin air. The difference between analysis of news and what is
charitably called speculation acquired more weight when, just days
later, Milosevic accepted on paper a diktat from his opponents as
well as from Russia without any discernible regard for the fact
that he had just been indicted.
</P>
<P>
   And this was just one of the latest episodes in a string going
back to the evening in late March just before the first bombs began
to fall on Serbia, when the fact that then-Russian Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov's plane had done a U-turn over the Atlantic was
confidently said to spell a disastrous rupture in US-Russian
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Now we're all at it again, like passengers massed on one side of
a ferry boat all running to the other side. As I write, there isn't
any ink to dry on any agreement, and already we're imagining the
impact of ``success.''
</P>
<P>
   The only people I trust in military and diplomatic circles have
been vehemently urging caution for days _ caution about whether
there will be any Serbian ink, whether it will dry, what will
happen if it does, and how any ``agreement'' will be implemented.
The one thing I can count on, they keep saying, is that the
military campaign will not end until there is an unmistakable sign
that ``all'' Serbian forces in Kosovo are on the way back to
Serbia. In short, the advice is that we should take it a day at a
time, and you would think that in a business supposedly structured
around breaking news that would be advice that people know how to
take.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not how most of the system is operating. If there's
one guaranteed loser out of all this it is misnamed 24-hour news
cycle, built around television but with print a significant
enabler.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of this decade, the crisis that became the
Persian Gulf War enshrined the never-ending news cycle with genuine
success _ led by a maturing CNN with a major assist from the
traditional networks.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard news, as in information, all the time. Sure it
missed a few _ the true record of the Patriot missile and
``precision'' bombing, the significance of Saddam Hussein's
permitted survival, Gulf War Syndrome _ but that was the nature of
the story, not the coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward. Today, the traditional networks have cut past the
bone on coverage, and CNN remains fantastic but only during the
diminishing hours when it actually has news on. What the system,
enabled by print new cable networks, is really selling and
competing over is spin and attitude _ pursuits mostly suitable for
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   And so, while the bombs fell, the mob gave us Milosevic's
first-week triumph that could not be reversed, Madeleine Albright's
war, the decimation of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the securely
dug-in Serbian armed forces, the emergence of nasty Russia as
political power triumphant, almost daily accounts of NATO's
collapse of unity and will, the pointless futility of air
campaigns, and the hideous timing of the war crimes court.
</P>
<P>
   By emphasizing the spin cycle to such an extent, the system has
once again compromised the credibility of its once-basic product,
news. Any hints that anybody learned anything from the impeachment
fiasco are clearly premature.
</P>
<P>
   But the proprietors of printing presses and networks should
understand that confusing people in a crisis is the worst way to
promote your product when more people are paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, my private phone lines are open and my TV is
tuned to C-SPAN. Slower, but much more reliable.
</P>

NATURAL BORN SPELLERS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For whiz kid Nupur Lala, spelling homework paid off last
Thursday _ to the tune of $10,000 _ when the 14-year-old from Tampa
won the annual Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee. Her winning
word was logorrhea _ from the Greek for word and flow, though it's
a 20th-century formation, probably modeled on diarrhea, says the
Oxford English Dictionary. As competition words go, it's not
especially challenging; other kids got stung by killer bee words
like pidan, terete, gnathic, and aretalogy. But Nupur and her 248
competitors put on an impressive show, all in all.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers, though, think spelling bees are about as
educational as frog races (and a lot more painful for the
contestants; in the Dublin, Ohio, frog jump _ so say the official
rules _ ``tired frogs may be exchanged for rested frogs at no
charge.'' No such luck for the tired young spellers.) The merit of
bees has been debated for years, along predictable lines: Do they
demand meaningless rote learning or provide valuable discipline for
developing minds?
</P>
<P>
   For the semi-pro Scripps Howard bee, in its 72nd year, the
question is especially pointed. As a fellow editor noted, each
year's news story explains that ``many of the words come from the
Paideia,'' a handbook of difficult words passed out to contestants
months in advance. Repeat contenders can study earlier versions of
Paideia, too, since unused words from the past may pop up in the
``surprise'' round. So some kids are putting in serious study time
_ Nupur claimed two hours a day, another contestant five hours _ on
spelling practice.
</P>
<P>
   The words they learn range from the ordinary and useful _
potable, streptomycin, brouhaha _ to those so recondite that even
future William F. Buckley fans may never see them again:
ochlophobia, inconcinnity, traineau. And of course, a word not used
is soon forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   But the manual alone will not a winner make; it's just a
compilation of words, sorted into categories and ranked from easier
to harder. To compete, kids need to know what the words mean and
how they're pronounced, which is where the hours of research and
memorization and parental drill come in.
</P>
<P>
   The question, for skeptics, is whether this is a profitable use
of young scholars' study time. You don't have to be a no-drills
dogmatist to harbor doubts: If they're going to memorize, why not
make it something memorable? When my mother was in school, each
class memorized a poem, together, every six weeks of the school
year. And at her 50th high school reunion, the crowd could still
recite those poems in unison: ``By the rude bridge that arched the
flood'' . . . ``Sail on! sail on! sail on! and on!'' ... ``In
Flanders fields the poppies grow....''
</P>
<P>
   Today's selections would be different, of course, but if you
were memorizing for two hours a day, wouldn't you rather end up
with a head full of Yeats and Dickinson _ or even Ogden Nash and
Dorothy Parker _ than the definitions of oast and affenpinscher?
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, Scripps Howard is trying to make the bee an
educational experience. Several groups of words in Paideia are
drawn from books students enjoy _ ``Emma,'' ``A Wrinkle in Time,''
``O Pioneers!'' On the bee's Web site,
</P>
<P>
   http://spellingbee.com, a weekly study guide delves into word
derivations, Latin prefixes, and other aids to understanding how
words work. And for pupils whose parents are all drilled out,
there's an audio version of the 1999 book, with an announcer giving
words and definitions just as in a real bee. (Try it out. If you
start to feel smug, just zoom your RealPlayer toward the end of the
list.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, I'm grateful that I wasn't drafted for spelling bee duty
till adulthood. Grown-up bees have several advantages: They're
charity events, so you're doing good just by showing up; you get to
work in teams, allowing you to share the blame (or, rarely,
credit); and you're seasoned enough to see how much is just dumb
luck. One year you bomb out on accipiter and moan when the next
team gets byssinosis (``We could have spelled that!''); next year
you get the softball and your opponents draw xiphoid. And whatever
the outcome, grown-up spellers don't cry, throw up backstage, or
ask their parents to file a protest.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the reason could be that they're old enough to go out
for a consoling post-bee drink. Maybe spelling contests, like
Scotch, should be reserved for the over-21 set.
</P>

A PLOT THAT DOESN'T TRAVEL WELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
 
HAVANA BAY 
By Martin Cruz Smith 
Random House, 329 pp., $24.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bar is set very high for a new adventure thriller from
Martin Cruz Smith, the author of ``Gorky Park.'' Unfortunately,
``Havana Bay'' falls short of his personal best.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has a great gift for reportage. Better than most
mass-market authors, he travels, learns, absorbs, and then
re-creates foreign milieus. After a brief, two-week stay in
pre-glasnost Moscow, he made the city come alive for Western
readers in his breakthrough thriller, 1981's ``Gorky Park.'' Smith
ably rendered post-Cold War Germany in ``Red Square,'' and he
trolled the little-known world of Russia's blue-ocean fishing fleet
in ``Polar Star.''
</P>
<P>
   His most recent novel, ``Rose,'' was his greatest triumph _ and
his most grating commercial failure. ``Rose'' re-created the world
of Lancashire deep-pit coal mining during England's Industrial
Revolution, and mined intriguing seams of clerical intrigue and
androgyny. But ``Rose'' failed to find its audience _ which, I
think, explains ``Havana Bay.''
</P>
<P>
   In this novel, Smith dances with the one what brung him to
bestseller status: the brooding, phlegmatic Moscow police
investigator Arkady Renko. Renko, memorably played by the brooding,
phlegmatic William Hurt in the Hollywood version of ``Gorky Park,''
was pretty downbeat 18 years ago. Adrift in the chaos of modern
Russia, he's more downbeat than ever. The love of his life has
perished accidentally in a laxly run Moscow hospital. A former
colleague has encountered a spot of trouble in Havana. Author Smith
correctly concludes that Renko is long overdue for some fun in the
sun.
</P>
<P>
   So we depart for Havana. Once again, Smith renders a foreign
landscape almost perfectly. ``Havana Bay'' is by far the most
interesting piece of journalism to emerge from the newly accessible
Cuba of recent years. Castro's grand experiment is nearing its end.
Cuban society is torn between two pasts: the faded glory of the
Revolution, and the idealized memory of capitalist Havana, where
the likes of Ernest Hemingway and Mafia boss Meyer Lansky worked
the gaming tables.
</P>
<P>
   But today, competing mafias _ Russian, American, Caribbean _ are
circling the island like sharks. The once-heroic Soviet comrades,
now too poor to buy Cuban sugar at inflated prices and pump the
island full of cut-rate East-bloc oil, are reviled. The city
suffers frequent power outages. The stores are nearly empty.
Everybody's a pimp, figuratively or literally. In other words, this
provides a perfect setting for a Martin Cruz Smith-Arkady Renko
outing.
</P>
<P>
   The plot starts out promisingly enough. A Russian ``floater''
(waterlogged corpse) surfaces in Havana Bay. Inept Cuban police
investigators, half-trained by the Russians, half-trained by the
FBI, prove that two halves don't make a whole. Corrupt cops;
vestigial Russian diplomats on the take; a chain-smoking,
round-heeled ballerina hoping to emigrate _ among these colorful
types Smith even weaves in a character named George Washington
Walls, identical in almost every way to the real-life Charles Hill,
a black-separatist militant who hijacked a plane in 1971 and still
lives in Havana. But a funny thing happens as we stroll along the
ratty sidewalks of the Malecon oceanfront: We get lost.
</P>
<P>
   The French have a lovely expression for getting bogged down _
``pedaling in sauerkraut'' _ which is how I felt about a third of
the way into the book. Characters appeared and disappeared for no
apparent reason. I felt buried under an avalanche of colorful but
confusing apartment hideaways, place names, and side trips to
nowhere. (The novel does include a map, which helps enormously.)
Left to my own devices, I would not have finished the book.
</P>
<P>
   What's left to say? Havana good. Renko pretty good. Renko-Cubana
romance pretty predictable. Plot not so good. Renko ends up back in
Moscow, available for reassignment. End of one story; beginning of
another?

FILMMAKERS APOLOGIZE FOR REMARK ABOUT COLUMBINE SHOOTING
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``There's Something About Mary'' filmmakers Bobby
and Peter Farrelly drew confused silence from the star-studded
crowd at the 1999 MTV Movie Awards when they made a Columbine High
School massacre remark.
</P>
<P>
   At the awards show taping Saturday at Santa Monica Airport's
Barker Hanger, the brothers said they hoped the next time some kid
wipes out his class he'll think of a movie by them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Something About Mary'' won four awards, including best
movie, best actress, best villain and best fight.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the Farrellys apologized, saying they detest violence
and were only trying to state their opinion that ``Hollywood is
getting too much blame for all of our society's senseless violence,
particularly in our nation's schools.''
</P>
<P>
   MTV said it would delete the Columbine remark from the awards
broadcast Thursday.

 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two historic cities, close enough to combine on a visit South,
and offering new reasons to visit, are Washington and Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is always a good choice for families. There's
something for every age, and, best of all, most attractions are
free.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History has opened
a new Discovery Center that features a state-of-the-art IMAX
theater, currently showing ``Africa's Elephant Kingdom.'' The
center also includes a new Atrium Cafe with seating for 600, and
offers added museum shops, which have been lauded as the best shops
of their kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Some Smithsonian museums will be staying open in the evening,
but only to 7:30 p.m. at the latest.
</P>
<P>
   If you missed the Mary Cassatt exhibition in Boston, it is now
on view at the National Gallery of Art through Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   And, at the Washington Monument an interactive center focusing
on Washington _ the man, the city, and the monument _ is open.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore is celebrating its harbor area with the opening of the
National Historic Seaport, which capitalizes on the harbor's
longstanding maritime heritage. Visitors can purchase a Seaport
Passcard to gain access to 15 sites. Attractions can be reached on
foot or by water taxi. Among Baltimore's attractions are Fort
McHenry, the site that inspired ``The Star Spangled Banner,'' the
USS Constellation (the 1854 warship just underwent a 2 1/2-year
renovation and opens on July 2), the Baltimore Museum of Industry,
the US submarine Torsk (it patrolled the Pacific in World War II
and holds the record for the most dives of any sub). And head for
the 27th floor of the world's tallest pentagonal building,
Baltimore's World Trade Center, for great views of the city and
harbor. For more information on the seaport, call 877-NH-CPORT.

TRY NOT TO CATCH THE INFLATION BUG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Listen closely this week and you'll probably hear a lot of
inflation talk. Don't get too caught up in it.
</P>
<P>
   The inflation bug has been buzzing ever since the Federal
Reserve shifted its bias toward raising interest rates last month.
Three government reports will be scrutinized for more clues this
week, the most important being Friday's release of monthly data on
wholesale inflation.
</P>
<P>
   That will set the stage for next week's big event: Fed chairman
Alan Greenspan's testimony before the Joint Economic Committee of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from its real-life affects, on everything from the value
of a paycheck to the price of eggs, inflation also whips financial
markets. The bond market is nipping at 6 percent for the first time
in more than a year and analysts wonder if stocks prices,
particularly those of small companies, can hold up if interest
rates continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
   But inflation has been so subdued for so long, amid the kind of
economic expansion that historically sparked higher prices, that
markets seem to have a heightened sensitivity to the trend they
have long expected to surface. Inflation may indeed turn out to be
rising, but few analysts or economists believe a serious problem is
before us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who argues that we're looking at a horrible inflation
picture should have their head examined,'' said Nancy Kimelman,
chief economist at Technical Data in Boston. ``It's a little bit of
an uptick from an unsustainably low level.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Fleet Financial Group chief economist Nicholas Perna: ``If
inflation gets bad, it will be 3 percent instead of 2.5 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean stock and bond markets will pay little
attention to inflation data or Greenspan's comments. The odds on a
short-term market jolt one way or the other are better than even.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're more sensitive to inflation fears than we should
be,'' said Barry Evans, fixed income strategist at John Hancock
Funds in Boston. ``The market will probably react a little more
than it should to a slightly higher inflationary bias. I personally
feel it's done that.''
</P>
<P>
   The facts usually recited to explain sustained low inflation,
from a globalized workforce, vast gains in productivity and the
abundance of capacity they both created, have not changed.
</P>
<P>
   But for investors who need something to worry about, consider a
kind of back-door inflation scenerio that could pose a more
realistic threat in the future. The culprit: America's gaping trade
deficit and its eventual impact on the value of the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The US trade deficit in goods and services reached a record
$19.7 billion in March, running at about two to three times the
typical monthly rate recorded over five years before 1998. Measured
as a percentage of gross domestic product, the deficit is near
record territory, but not quite there yet.
</P>
<P>
   That means foreigners are collecting more and more dollars over
time. We might have paid for Saudi oil or German cars or French
wine, but every trade deficit dollar is like money borrowered from
a foreign lender.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually foreigners will have too many dollars for their own
liking, sooner rather than later at the current pace of the trade
deficit. If they sell dollars on a large scale, the value of a buck
will head lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have now become not only the largest debtor, but the
largest by any stretch of the imagination,'' said Perna. ``At some
point, the risk is that investors could get concerned because they
are increasingly less diversified.''
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston chief economist Wayne Ayers doesn't think that will
happen soon, but still expects it. ``As the rest of the world
starts to recover, investors logically are going to want to not
abandon the dollar, but diversify,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The declining value of dollars creates inflation and boosts
interest rates as a lock-step reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Its effect on rates was shown in the middle 1980s, when a
declining dollar helped boost long-term interest rates from about
7.5 percent to nearly 10 percent. That period followed a steep
decline in long-term interest rates from a peak of nearly 14
percent two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   As investors diversify out of dollars, as Perna and Ayers
suggest, money will flow anywhere in search of the best value.
Evans thinks it's an easy call to predict where that will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you would see is dollars chasing the competitive
advantage created in these Asian and Latin nations,'' he said. ``Go
to where the pain was, because that will be the source of
competitive advantage in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not going to happen next week, or anytime very soon.

DREAM FOR A DOLLAR? LOTTERY PLAYERS GIVE IT A SHOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE COSTANTINOU  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Forget it. Stop dreaming. Save your buck. You're
not going win that $65 million SuperLotto jackpot on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Because Jeff Davis will. Why? Because that's the way life is. Of
course, this being California's biggest SuperLotto jackpot in about
a year _ it hit $70 million in July, and $104 million in April 1998
_ people have been lining up at Lotto machines, forking over $1 per
dream, no matter how ridiculous the odds or how lousy their luck
has always been.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has won the last six drawings. Davis, 28, is confident he
will change that.
</P>
<P>
   Not only had he never succumbed to Lotto Fever, but he works at
Healthy Spirits, a gourmet market that sells lottery tickets.
</P>
<P>
   This irony was too much Monday night for one customer, Anthony
Palombit, a personnel consultant who for the past 20 years has been
playing the same ``lucky'' numbers, game after game.
</P>
<P>
   His picks _ based on his family's birthdays _ have reaped just a
few $5 wins.
</P>
<P>
   Palombit, 41, heard Davis go on and on about how he'd give the
money away to friends and AIDS charities because money can't buy
happiness. He then took out his wallet, slapped a dollar on the
counter, and said he wanted to cash in on Davis' luck.
</P>
<P>
   Davis picked out the numbers. Four of the winning numbers will
be based on Davis' family birthdays. The fifth is 9, his lucky
astrological number. The sixth number is 35, what he considers the
ideal age. When Davis wins, the men pledged to split the jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, not everyone would agree that Davis is the sure
winner.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' boss, Rami Barqawi, is one skeptic. He plans to buy his
own Lotto ticket anyway _ though maybe, just maybe, he'll let Davis
push the buttons for the Quick Pick, just in case.
</P>
<P>
   And if Barqawi wins? He's old enough to know that money can buy
some happiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be in Costa Rica, sitting on some beach butt-naked,
smoking fat ones, listening to Bob Marley,'' Barqawi, 32, said with
that wistful, faraway look of Lotto players.

NEW AND NOTABLE BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 Special to The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; FULL MOON &QL; 
 &UR; Michael Light (Knopf, $50)
</P>
<P>
   We doubt there is a more seductive image anywhere than that
taken of the Earth by astronaut Michael Collins on July 24, 1969, a
few hours before the crew of Apollo 11 splashed down after making
the first landing on the moon. Only a fraction of the planet is
visible against the unforgiving blackness of space _ a teasing,
blue curve that is so lovely, so familiar in its embodiment of all
that is (begin itals) home, (end itals) that it is poignant even
for those of us who never have been so far removed. It's not often
that New &AMP; Notable tells you a book is worth $50, but here we are.
You can see from the cover and the title that the Earth itself is a
supporting player. The conquered moon is the real focus, and it is
breathtaking. Light has chosen 129 images from more than 32,000
made by Apollo astronauts from 1968 to 1972. Only a few have been
published previously, but the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration allowed its master negatives to be taken off site
and digitally scanned for this volume. The resulting reproduction
is as haunting as it is near-perfect. There is, for example, a
photograph of a snapshot left on the surface of the moon by Apollo
16 astronaut Charles Duke _ a picture of his family, incongruous
not just because of its muted colors but its Beaver Cleaver
sweetness in the most stark and forbidding of places. In another
photo, Apollo 17 commander Eugene Cernan looks as if he has worked
a long day in a coal mine, but the smudges on his face are really
lunar soil from three days of exploring the moon's Taurus-Littrow
valley. With essays by Light and Andrew Chaikin (author of ``A Man
on the Moo''n). &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE HOME DEPOT: BUILT FROM SCRATCH &QL; 
 &UR; Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank (Times, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Bernie Marcus made a speech to a Rotary Club and asked
how many of the 400 people in his audience were
``do-it-yourselfers,'' how many owned tools, how many could repair
a toilet without calling a plumber. About 20 people raised their
hands. Fifteen years later, he appeared before the same group and
asked the same questions, and only 15 out of 450 (begin itals)
didn't (end itals) raise their hands. The difference? Home Depot,
which in 20 years had revolutionized the way people look at home
repair. It all began on April 14, 1978, when Marcus and Arthur
Blank were fired from their jobs at Daylin Corp. by an arrogant
chief executive who called himself ``Ming the Merciless'' after the
villain in the old Flash Gordon movies. Marcus and Blank were
dejected, but spurred on by friends (including Sol Price, founder
of Price Club), they met over coffee and sketched plans for their
dream, the home-improvement store of the future. They had no money,
but plenty of nerve _ Marcus walked away from $2 million in
start-up money from Ross Perot because he thought Perot was too
controlling (if Perot had behaved better, his original share of
Home Depot stock would be worth $58 billion today). They found the
cash elsewhere, picked a name for their company (an early rejectee:
``Bad Bernie's Buildall'') and began with four stores in Atlanta.
Today, they have 775 stores and $30 billion in sales. This is the
appealing story of a business coup accomplished by the seats of its
founders' pants, with energy, conviction and more than a little
luck. Marcus and Blank surprised even themselves, but they say
every word here is true _ ``Cross our hearts and swear to bleed
orange.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; I AIN'T GOT TIME TO BLEED &QL; 
 &UR; Jesse Ventura (Villard, $19.95)
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, the professional wrestler who was elected governor of
Minnesota, spends the first chapter of this book explaining that he
is not a politician, and the next chapter (in which he tells us
where he stands on the issues) sounding just like one. He then
proceeds, with profound bad judgment, to discuss the time he
visited a Nevada bordello just before he went overseas with the
Navy SEALs, trading a belt he'd made out of bullet-shell casings
for time with a less-than-opportunistic prostitute. You alone can
decide how much you want to know about Ventura, but Garrison
Keillor has written a fictionalized account of the governor's
escapades (``Me, by Jimmy (Big Boy) Valent''e) that is mildly funny
and better than this. In that spirit, we'll seize the chance to
mention Donny Osmond's new book, ``Life Is Just'' ``What You Make
It'' (Hyperion, $22.95). Donny does not visit any bordellos, but he
spends lots of time lamenting the trials and tribulations of being
himself, which might wear thin on readers who make do without their
own talk shows. Oddly enough, these very different men make the
same mistake in ignoring the rules of a good autobiography. First
hurdle: You have to be a pretty interesting guy to carry one. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ADVICE TO WRITERS &QL; 
 &UR; Edited by Jon Winokur (Pantheon, $22)
</P>
<P>
   Books like this are a dime a dozen, and we can't put them down.
``Appealing workplaces are to be avoided,'' Annie Dillard says.
``One wants a room with no view, so imagination can meet memory in
the dark.'' Here's F. Scott Fitzgerald on punctuation: ``Cut out
all the exclamation marks. An exclamation mark is like laughing at
your own joke.'' D.H. Lawrence on style: ``Be still when you have
nothing to say; when genuine passion moves you, say what you've got
to say, and say it hot.'' Jules Renard on words: ``(They are) the
pieces of change in the currency of a sentence. They must not get
in the way. There is always too much small change.'' As proof that
New &AMP; Notable can take a hit, we mention what we consider to be one
of E.B. White's lesser thoughts: ``It is almost impossible to write
anything decent using the editorial `we,' unless you are the Dionne
family.'' &QL;

AIRPORT'S 2000 BACKUP PLAN: CALL IN THE KIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL DeMARE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLONIE, N.Y. _ The Albany International Airport has a year 2000
contingency plan that includes hiring high school and college
students to carry baggage to arriving passengers if the luggage
carousel fails on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The students, who will be on call, may also be used to operate
doors and direct passengers, John A. O'Donnell, the airport's chief
operating officer, said Monday in presenting the Y2K plan to
airport authority members.
</P>
<P>
   Baggage from incoming flights would be loaded on vehicles, as
usual, which would take the luggage to the carousel. If the
carousel isn't operating, the students would grab the suitcases and
run in with them, O'Donnell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are great; they can go forever,'' he said after the
session.
</P>
<P>
   Students would also be used to hand out tickets at the parking
areas if the automatic ticket dispensers fail, he said. Airport
workers would be in charge of the students, guiding them in the
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   John C. Egan, chief executive officer of the airport, indicated
that all airport personnel could be working on Jan. 1 to help with
potential emergencies. But the days following New Year's also could
produce problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The airport has an emergency generator that would kick in if
there are power failures, O'Donnell said. If the emergency
generator strikes out, then the airport's truck-mounted generator,
known to workers as ``Big Boy,'' would serve as the backup, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Egan said he has assurances that the power is not going to fail
on Jan. 1. But the airport has made preparations, as have other
businesses and some residents, in the event that power, telephones
and water supplies are cut off or curtailed by computer failures
liked to the Year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   Computer experts fear that many computers originally programmed
to recognize only the last two digits of a year will fail or
malfunction on Jan. 1, 2000, when the machines will assume it is
1900.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, the airport staff worked to identify systems and all
key elements at the airport that could be affected by the Y2K
glitch, said J. Dwight Hadley, the airport's chief financial
officer. Now the proposal will be fine-tuned.
</P>
<P>
   The plan has three priorities _ mandatory, important and
nonessential.
</P>
<P>
   Power, the airport's main computer system and water supplies are
listed as mandatory. Loss of elevators, escalators, fire alarms and
computerized flight information (chalkboards and felt-tip markers
would substitute) are secondary. Considered nonessential are
parking lot gates and ticket dispensers.

WINE OF THE WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FRANK J. PRIAL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Monthelie Les Champs Fulliots 1996, Bouchard Pere et Fils,
Burgundy. About $30.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing a few Monthelie wines are shipped to our
shores because finding them in Burgundy can be frustrating.
Monthelie is a quiet village and easy to miss. Monthelie is not a
famous wine but at its best it can be a fine Burgundy. Less
concentrated than a Volnay, perhaps, but fruity and delicious.
Rustic is a word often used to describe Monthelie, but in this case
it is better than that. The wine has good body and a lingering
finish, and shows the new emphasis on excellence at this venerable
Burgundy house.

THREE-BEAN SALAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
(This is the third of eight columns by Thomas Keller, the chef and
owner of the French Laundry in Yountville, Calif. His collaborator
is Michael Ruhlman.) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've named this salad after those crocks of marinated green
beans, garbanzo and kidney beans in every American salad bar. But
my three-bean salad is really something entirely different, a
simple composition of dried beans and fresh beans: a base of pureed
white beans is infused with truffle oil, topped with a mixture of
fresh beans in a vinaigrette and finished with field greens or
fresh herbs.
</P>
<P>
   The key to success is your bean technique. Dried beans must be
properly rehydrated and then gently simmered, never boiled. If you
boil the heck out of beans, they tend to explode. Soaking them in
warm water and then gradually bringing the cooking liquid up to a
gentle heat insures even cooking and intact beans. Add salt toward
the end of cooking rather than at the beginning, or it will inhibit
rehydration.
</P>
<P>
   The salad works well with any fresh beans _ Blue Lake, haricots
verts, yellow wax, fava, lima or cranberry beans, to name some
possibilities _ cooked until they are firm but give no resistance
to the teeth. To cook fresh beans _ or any green vegetable, for
that matter _ I use a technique I call big-pot blanching: cook your
vegetable in so much water that the water does not lose its boil
when you add the vegetables. Your water should be heavily salted,
about a half cup for each gallon. The result is a vegetable of the
brightest possible color.
</P>
<P>
   If you've cooked your beans properly, you almost can't go wrong
with this salad. Feel free to experiment with the vinaigrette: wine
vinegars (sherry, red or Champagne) or balsamic are good choices. I
love to serve it throughout the summer when we have abundant
varieties of ``fresh from the garden'' beans. It's seasonal,
elegant and fun _ an interpretation of a salad bar standard that's
worthy, I think, of haute cuisine. &QL; 
 &QL; 
THREE-BEAN SALAD  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 2 hours, plus overnight soaking of beans  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dried marrow beans or other white beans, soaked in 4 cups
water at room temperature overnight
</P>
<P>
   5 cups plus 2 tablespoons vegetable stock or canned vegetable
broth
</P>
<P>
   1 shallot, peeled and halved, plus 1 teaspoon minced
</P>
<P>
   1 small carrot, peeled
</P>
<P>
   Bouquet garni: 3 sprigs parsley, 1 sprig thyme and 1 bay leaf,
wrapped in two 5-inch sections of leek greens and tied with string
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt and freshly ground white pepper
</P>
<P>
   4 to 5 tablespoons white truffle oil
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons sherry wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 cup trimmed haricots verts in 1-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 cup trimmed yellow wax beans in 1-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   { cup shelled, peeled fava beans
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   2 cups frisee or baby greens, for garnish.
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon peeled, seeded, diced tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   1. Prepare the bean puree: Drain the white beans. In a large
saucepan or casserole, combine the beans with 4 cups of water.
Place over low heat, and bring to a simmer. Remove from the heat,
and allow the beans to rest for 5 minutes. Remove any beans that
float to the surface. Drain, and chill under cold running water.
Return the beans to the saucepan, and add 5 cups of the vegetable
stock, shallot halves, carrot and bouquet garni. Place over low
heat, and simmer for 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Add \ teaspoon salt, and continue to cook until the beans are
completely tender, 25 to 30 minutes. There should still be some
liquid remaining in the pan. Place a strainer over a bowl, and
drain the beans, reserving the liquid. Remove and discard the
carrot and bouquet garni. Using a food processor, begin to puree
the beans. With the machine running, slowly add the reserved liquid
through the feed tube, adding just enough to make a smooth puree.
Next, pass the puree through a tamis or drum sieve. Measure 1 cup
of puree into a mixing bowl, and set aside the remainder for
another use. Whisk in the remaining 2 tablespoons vegetable stock,
2 tablespoons of the truffle oil and 1 teaspoon of the vinegar. The
puree should have a creamy consistency; add 1 more tablespoon of
truffle oil if desired. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   3. Prepare the bean salad: Make an ice-water bath by filling a
large bowl with ice and water. Bring a large pot of water to a
boil, adding { cup of salt for each gallon. Add the haricots verts,
and blanch until they are cooked but still firm to the bite, 2 to 3
minutes. Using a slotted spoon, immediately transfer the beans to
the ice-water bath. Bring the water to a boil again, and repeat
with the yellow wax beans and finally the fava beans. Drain the
chilled beans, and pat dry with paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   4. In a small bowl, whisk together 2 tablespoons of the truffle
oil, the olive oil, lemon juice and remaining vinegar. Season to
taste with salt and pepper. Toss 1 tablespoon of vinaigrette with
the salad greens, and season to taste with salt and pepper. In a
mixing bowl, combine the remaining vinaigrette with the blanched
beans, diced tomatoes, and minced shallots. Season with salt and
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   5. To serve, use a spoon to smooth an even layer of puree in the
center of each serving plate. Arrange about 1/3 cup of the bean
salad over the puree. Gently stack a mound of greens over the
salad, and sprinkle the top with a little additional salt.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings.

`THE BASQUE KITCHEN' 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By AMANDA HESSER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Piperade is a quintessential Basque dish that combines the
signature ingredients: tomatoes, onion, garlic, chilies, and
controversy,'' reads the headnote to a recipe in Gerald Hirigoyen's
book, ``The Basque Kitchen'' (HarperCollins, $35).
</P>
<P>
   It is just that kind of light, clever touch that distinguishes
the book. Hirigoyen, the chef at Fringale and Pastis in San
Francisco, is a native of the Basque country, a land steeped for
centuries in conflict. As he returns to it in this book, you can
feel the love and respect he has for his homeland and for its
cuisine, how it fits into the larger world of French and Spanish
cooking.
</P>
<P>
   In the introduction, Hirigoyen places himself in Basque culture:
``I cannot paint like Ramiro Arrue. Nor can I compose like Maurice
Ravel, born in Ciboure; nor write like Pierre Loti ... who gave the
Basque heart a voice. I can, however, cook.''
</P>
<P>
   The book contains a mixture of old Basque dishes like gateau
Basque, a layered creamed-filled pastry, and garbure, a country
vegetable soup, and what Hirigoyen calls ``New Basque Cuisine,''
dishes like a quince and goat cheese layer cake and a salmon fillet
with red pepper sabayon. Surprisingly, the two styles of recipes
work together, an unusual success that can be attributed to the
author, who makes clear the distinctions between the two.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a lengthy introduction reviewing Basque cultural
history, the book is primarily a collection of recipes, with very
little commentary on technique. Hirigoyen speaks to the competent
cook.
</P>
<P>
   Hake San Sebastian style is one of his more challenging
restaurant-style recipes. The hake is floured and fried, then
quickly braised with clams, asparagus, peas, wine and, strangely
enough, chopped hard-boiled egg. The recipe turned out fine, but it
was the kind of dish that will be better the next time I try it,
now that I understand the components and how they must fit
together.
</P>
<P>
   Other recipes are much simpler. A gratin of walnuts and sheep's
milk cheese for dessert took about five minutes to assemble and
looked beautiful, puffed like a souffle and browned like a loaf of
bread. Best of all, though, was the flavor, rich with cheese and
walnuts and drifting pleasantly between sweet and savory.
</P>
<P>
   Cherries in red wine soup had a similar sort of instant
gratification. Red wine, port, sugar, vanilla bean, star anise and
citrus zests are simmered for a few minutes, then the pitted
cherries are added just long enough to wilt lightly.
</P>
<P>
   The dish to make you return to this book again and again,
though, is the humble baked garbanzo beans. The beans are simply
braised with garlic, bay leaves, coriander, chili and saffron.
absorbing the flavors of the aromatics. With a loaf of bread to sop
up the cooking liquid, I would have been happy to make a meal of
it.

A PERFECT CUT FOR THE GRILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MARK BITTMANN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There may be no meat better for grilling than boneless leg of
lamb. This is a cut that cooks reasonably quickly, usually in less
than half an hour, but still develops an irresistibly crunchy
crust. Even better, that crust can be flavored in minutes before it
is cooked with any of a dozen combinations of seasonings.
Marinating is unnecessary, as the meat itself has exquisite flavor
and really needs no more than salt.
</P>
<P>
   There are other advantages to boneless leg of lamb, also called
butterflied leg for the two-lobed shape formed when the bone is
removed. There is no need to do the boning yourself, as there once
was; nearly every supermarket carries boned leg. Most pieces are
big enough to serve six, and often 10, making the cut ideal for a
get-together. Best of all, the leg's irregular shape virtually
guarantees that every eater will be happy _ lamb is the only meat
good at every stage of doneness. When the thickest parts have
cooked to rare, the ends will be well done, the parts in between
medium.
</P>
<P>
   The boneless legs sold in supermarkets are sometimes wrapped in
an elastic net to form them into a round roast. For grilling,
remove this so the meat lies flat.
</P>
<P>
   If the larger end of the meat is three or more inches thick, you
might cut a flap to make that lobe thinner and flatter so that it
cooks more evenly. Using a sharp, thin-bladed knife and working
from the side of the lobe that faces the rest of the meat, make a
horizontal cut about halfway down from top to bottom, most of the
way through, and fold the meat out; in essence, you are
butterflying the butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   The thickness of the meat makes grilling easier than it is with
thinner cuts, because you can keep the lamb over the heat long
enough to insure a well-browned and crisp crust without overcooking
the interior. If you use a fairly hot, but not blazing hot,
charcoal or gas fire, you can sear the meat for five minutes on
each side. Then, either cover the grill or move the meat to a
cooler part and cook until done. The ideal moment is when an
instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the
meat reads 125 degrees. That means you will have rare meat in the
thick part, well-done meat at the ends. As always with grilled
food, the broiler _ essentially an upside-down grill _ is an
excellent alternative. Keep the rack four or six inches from the
heat source.
</P>
<P>
   Flavoring options are many. My favorite combinations include
coriander or fennel seeds for added crunch.  &QL; 
GRILLED BONELESS LEG OF LAMB  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: about 40 minutes  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 3- to 4-pound butterflied leg of lamb
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary or 2 teaspoons dried rosemary
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped or crushed fennel seeds
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Start a charcoal or wood fire or preheat gas grill or
broiler; the fire should be quite hot, and the rack 4 inches from
heat source.
</P>
<P>
   2. Trim the lamb of excess fat. Mix together the olive oil,
garlic, rosemary, fennel seeds, salt and pepper; rub this mixture
well into the lamb, making sure to get some into all the crevices.
(If time allows, it does no harm to let the prepared lamb sit in
the refrigerator for up to 24 hours; just return the meat to room
temperature before grilling.)
</P>
<P>
   3. Sear the meat over the hottest part of the grill until nicely
browned on both sides, 10 to 15 minutes. Continue to cook with the
grill covered or uncovered for 5 to 15 minutes longer, until the
internal temperature at the thickest part is about 125 degrees. Let
rest for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: at least 6 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Variations: Substitute 2 teaspoons fresh thyme (or 1 teaspoon
dried thyme) for fennel seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Use 1 tablespoon soy sauce or 1 tablespoon minced anchovies
instead of the salt.
</P>
<P>
   Use a combination of 1 tablespoon coriander seeds, 1 teaspoon
black peppercorns, 1 tablespoon garlic and 1 tablespoon fresh
ginger, all minced or coarsely ground together; moisten with a
little soy sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Rub the lamb all over with 2 tablespoons curry powder mixed with
{ cup yogurt.  &QL;

AN INN'S OWN BREWS (JUST REMEMBER WHICH DOOR YOU CAME IN)
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ELAINE LOUIE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORWICH, Vt. _ To cosset their guests, some innkeepers bake
their own bread, make their own jams or grow their own mesclun. Tim
Wilson, an owner of the Jasper Murdock Alehouse at the Norwich Inn
here, brews tasty, full-bodied beers _ from hoppy pale ales to
thick, creamy stouts.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Sally, bought the 1797 inn in 1991, and around the
same time, he went to England and discovered the local aromatic
ales. ``It was an epiphany,'' he said. ``Before, I had only had
American lagers.''
</P>
<P>
   So he started brewing Irish and English-style ales at the inn,
using English malts, hops and yeast. In 1993 he quit his job as a
senior loan officer at a bank in White River Junction and became a
brewmaster-innkeeper. Each year he makes 10 different beers, with
three available at any one time.
</P>
<P>
   The beers are on tap at the pub or in 22-ounce bottles for
takeout. ``Our customers pay at the front desk, go outside to a
little alley, and we hand it out to them through a side door, much
like Prohibition days, when this was a speak-easy,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the delayed gratification and extra footwork is
Vermont's liquor laws: The inn has two licenses, one to sell the
beer for consumption on premises, another for off-premises
consumption _ and each requires its own entryway-exit.
</P>
<P>
   The three brews now being sold are Whistling Pig Ale, Second
Wind Oatmeal Stout and Old Slipperyskin India Pale Ale.
</P>
<P>
   Whistling Pig Ale is smooth with a garnet color, a faint aroma
and a rounded, malty flavor with a lingering hoppy aftertaste.
Second Wind Oatmeal Stout pours black and has a thick,
coffee-colored head, a flavor that suggests espresso and a hoppy
bite.
</P>
<P>
   Old Slipperyskin is a medium amber color, with a hoppy aroma and
an equally hoppy, full-bodied flavor and a pleasantly bitter

was so strong it could squeeze sap from the biggest maple trees.
The bear is said to have been first seen by Indians in the 1600s
and by colonists in the 1740s.

   Comparing Flours &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the difference in flour made from spring wheat and
winter wheat?
</P>
<P>
   A. Spring wheat is sowed in the Northern United States and
Canada in spring and harvested in late summer, said Joe Caron, a
spokesman for King Arthur Flour. It is generally the faster-growing
``hard'' variety. When ground, hard spring wheat yields a
high-protein, high-gluten flour well suited for baking bread,
bagels and some pastas.
</P>
<P>
   Winter wheat is a slow-growing type that is sowed in the fall,
goes dormant over the winter and is harvested in mid- to late
spring. In the United States, winter wheat is grown from Texas to
Kansas and may be either ``hard'' or ``soft.'' In general, winter
wheat flour has less protein than spring wheat flour. It is best
for pastries, cakes and cookies. Many bakers say that it is more
flavorful than spring wheat because of its longer growing season.
</P>
<P>
   Although most brands of flour do not indicate the type of wheat,
bread flours are almost always made from hard spring wheat and
pastry flours from soft winter wheat. All-purpose flour is usually
a mix of several types.
</P>
<P>
   Butter Goes Gently Into a Good Batter  &QL; 
Q. I have been having a lot of trouble making a genoise sponge. It
somehow splits into two layers and comes out with a rubbery
texture. I take care to fold in the flour and butter carefully,
even lightening the melted butter with some of the beaten egg
first. What's going wrong?
</P>
<P>
   A. Making a perfect genoise cake takes practice, especially if
the recipe calls for butter: it adds richness and tenderness but
requires a delicate balance between beating the batter enough to
incorporate it but not so much that the eggs deflate.
</P>
<P>
   Your batter may not have been beaten enough. While you don't
want to overdo it, it's essential to fold the butter into the
batter very, very thoroughly, until no streaks of melted butter are
visible.
</P>
<P>
   Another trick, from Rose Levy Beranbaum's ``Cake Bible''
(William Morrow, 1988), is to add the melted butter when it's still
warm but not hot. Once the butter begins to solidify, it becomes
harder to incorporate and can weigh down the cake.
</P>
<P>
   No Fear of a Clove Shortage &QL; 
Q. Is there a worldwide shortage of ground cloves? I finally found
a tiny jar with } ounce (21 grams) in a supermarket for $7.19!
</P>
<P>
   A. Fear not: there are plenty of cloves to go around. That jar
was probably just a high-end brand using the best of the harvest.
The cloves were probably also packaged soon after grinding to
maintain freshness.
</P>
<P>
   Good cloves can be found for much less. One option is to buy
spices in bulk from a store with high turnover. They should smell
pleasantly pungent, with no traces of an off odor.
</P>
<P>
   You can also buy by mail. Penzey's Spices, (414) 679-7207, sells
\ cup (1.2 ounces) of ground cloves for $2.29.
</P>
<P>
   If Worms Show Up in the Fish Fillet &QL; 
Q. Recently I purchased lemon sole at a reputable fish market. I
put it in the pan to saute and was horrified to see two very thin
worms, about two inches long, crawling out of the flesh. The vendor
refunded my money and explained that this condition is endemic to
certain fish. What kinds of fish are these? Do the worms pose any
danger if ingested?
</P>
<P>
   A. Fish that feed on the bottom of the ocean, like haddock,
flounder and sole, are especially susceptible to parasites, said
Dr. Mike Timmons, professor of agriculture and biological
engineering and director of the Cornell Aquaculture Program at
Cornell University.
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't impractical, the fish fillets could be put on a
light table and screened for worms before being sold. But most fish
are worm-free. And if you should eat a parasite, rest assured that
it is not harmful.  &QL;

 MIAMI: it is.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The company pre-dates this new, troubled Miami.
</P>
<P>
   It began in 1949, Hooks said, with a ``phone on a post,''
outside the now-closed Cafe Society on Northwest 20th Street and
Third Avenue. From then into the 1960s, Miami's black neighborhoods
rang with music from high-end dance clubs, where Cab Calloway
shouted ``Hidie-Hidie-Hey,'' and Sammy Davis Jr. danced in a haze
of cigarette smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Society Cab was part of it. Its original owners painted a top
hat, cane and white gloves on their doors, promising that ``before
you can get your hat, cane and gloves, the cab is there,'' Hooks
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was Cafe Society, Harlem Square, Rockland Palace, Sir
John's, the Mary Elizabeth, the Night Beat,'' all gone, Hooks said.
``The riots killed them.''
</P>
<P>
   They folded in the violence that would become shorthand for
Overtown and Liberty City, for decades. First there were the riots
after the killing of Martin Luther King Jr., in 1968, the McDuffie
riots _ sparked by the killing of a black man by the police _ in
the 1980s, and the more recent drug wars that left gang members and
innocent bystanders bleeding in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   All the other black-owned cab companies folded. Buses ran only
when it was safe. But Society kept running, Hooks said.
</P>
<P>
   Crack cocaine changed everything in the mid-1980s, as it did in
other inner cities, as addicts fed their habits with anything they
could steal. Society's cabs became targets, and life in the
driver's seat of the Ford Crown Victorias and Chevrolet Caprices
became much cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   On Mother's Day 1994, three young men climbed into Al Hooks' cab
at 14th and 65th. He drove awhile, until one man shoved a gun at
him and said, ``OK, Papa, give it up,'' Hooks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' he said, ``we had a confrontation. He shot me once in
the stomach. I shot him in the chest. Bullet ripped me all open.''
</P>
<P>
   In the trauma unit, the police asked him if he could describe
his adversary. ``I looked over beside me and said, `There he is.'
''
</P>
<P>
   The man was lying next to him.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's most terrifying attack was in 1970, when a man who
sat in the back seat mumbling to himself reached across the seat,
circled an arm around his throat and drove an ice pick into his
chest.
</P>
<P>
   The two men fought in the cab, then out the door, with the car
still rolling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fought in the street,'' said Richardson, who finally got to
his radio and called for help. He did not call the police, but the
cab company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family,'' explained Hooks.
</P>
<P>
   The cabs swarmed there. They did it when Al Hooks went down in
1984, and when Franklin ``Dark 'n' Lovely'' Scott was shot last
year. They even carried him to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, the drivers tend to pick up people they
know by sight, or by address. Many of them pass strangers by, and
pick up passengers who have grown old with the company, or at least
grown familiar.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers like Hooks and Bain are proud that their hard work
paved the way for a better life for their families, but they like
to believe it gives others, people they know only by address, a
push in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they have been scarred too often, by bullets and rocks and
ice picks, to have romantic notions of their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But if they did not believe they were doing something grander,
something deeper, the drivers said, there would be no reason to
risk so much for a $4 fare that pays $3.25.

SCIENTISTS DISCOVER TWO HEAVY ELEMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ Berkeley scientists have discovered two new
elements, the heaviest ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Unromantically dubbed 116 and 118, they were created inside a
cyclotron, or atom smasher, at the Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory. They're as fleeting as a discovery can be, though: Each
lives only a moment. Then, within a tiny fraction of a second, they
decay into subatomic fragments and pure energy.
</P>
<P>
   At the lab, people are very excited by the discovery that
involves a team led by physicist Ken Gregorich.
</P>
<P>
   ``A huge amount of effort has gone into it,'' said Claude
Lyneis, an accelerator physicist who runs the 88-inch cyclotron
where the discovery was made.
</P>
<P>
   Lyneis said the lab decided to announce the discovery Monday
morning after rumors of the achievement began to appear on academic
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery marks a major step toward one of nuclear
physicists' Shangri-Las: a hypothetical ``island of stability'' of
super-heavy elements that might last for many years, rather than
instantly decaying. The heaviest element found in sizable amounts
in nature is uranium, with the atomic number 92. (The number refers
to the number of protons, the positively charged occupants of the
atomic nucleus, in an element.)
</P>
<P>
   Physicists who study the nuclear structure of atoms have been
seeking super-heavy elements for decades. They dreamed of finding
super-heavy elements in the ``island of stability'' that might
endure for billions of years.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Berkeley scientists entered a Bay Area Rapid
Transit tunnel to look for radiation from hypothesized super-heavy
elements in the geological layers. They looked there because the
purported elements' radioactive signals would be easier to detect
than on the surface, where background radiation from cosmic rays
and other sources constantly confuses instruments.
</P>
<P>
   But they found nothing, said physicist Darleane Hoffman of
Lawrence Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   So they tried to create the elements by bashing together
high-speed particles inside accelerators. So did physicists working
in Russia, who previously said they had created _ in collaboration
with scientists from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory east of
San Francisco _ element 114. However, the Russian-Livermore claim
is based on a single observation and is not yet proven, Lawrence
Berkeley scientists maintain.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the discovery of 116 and 118 is based on the
Lawrence Berkeley scientists' observations of three separate decays
of the elements in the cyclotron, Lyneis said. Element 118 decays
into 116, then into smaller products.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, he said, ``it looks like we've landed on the edge of the
island of stability, or on the shore.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman said old hopes of finding super-heavy elements that last
a billion years or so have faded. Nowadays, optimists hope to find
super-heavy elements that last about a century.
</P>
<P>
   Does the discovery have practical applications? Hoffman recalled
the words of the late Lawrence Berkeley Nobel laureate Glenn
Seaborg, who died early this year after a career that included the
synthesis of the element plutonium, used in nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot very often predict the practical applications of
basic science,'' Seaborg said, ``but we can predict that those
practical applications will occur to the enduring benefit of man.''

VOUVRAYS: BEYOND TRADITION
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By FRANK PRIAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VOUVRAY, France _ The last time I was here, 14 years ago, the
railroad was planning to run its new high-speed train through the
town's vineyards. The winemakers were up in arms, and one of them,
Gaston Huet, explained it all to me over a bottle of his 1947
Vouvray, an unforgettable wine the color of burnished gold.
</P>
<P>
   The trains went elsewhere and the vines were saved, but I never
forgot that 1947 wine. Deciding to go back to Vouvray to meet some
of the new winemakers, I called Jacqueline Friedrich, who wrote ``A
Wine &AMP; Food Guide to the Loire'' (Henry Holt, 1996). She told me
about Catherine and Didier Champalou, a young couple with 50 acres
of vineyards who are making a name for themselves. In her book, she
described them as having created ``one of the most exciting
wineries in Vouvray.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Go see them,'' she advised, and I did. And never got any
farther.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Champalous' cellar was carved out of the chalky soil
some 400 years ago, the couple are relative newcomers. ``We only
started in 1984,'' Mrs. Champalou, 38, said. ``At first, we had one
hectare of vines. Now, we have 20, which is just about what one
needs to succeed independently in Vouvray.''
</P>
<P>
   That's about 50 acres. And from that plot comes both sparkling
and still wines that are creating a stir for their intense taste.
In this tradition-bound region, their freshness makes them
standouts.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Champalou is a Vouvray native whose grandfather once worked
some of the land she and her husband now call their own. Champalou,
40, is also from a Loire winemaking family, and grew up about 30
miles from Vouvray. They met at viticultural school in nearby
Saumur.
</P>
<P>
   The Champalou wines range from dry to intensely sweet, or what
the French call moelleux. With the couple's guidance, I tasted many
of them. They may differ in sweetness, but they share the same
flavor intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, finding them in the United States is difficult
outside the major markets. Most of the Champalous' annual
production, 5,000 cases, is sold in France, where good Vouvray has
a solid following.
</P>
<P>
   Vouvray is one of the best-known appellations in the Loire
Valley, along with Muscadet, Sancerre, Chinon, Bourgueil, Saumur
and Anjou. Eight communes are entitled to the Vouvray appellation,
but the best wines come from the vines closest to the river in four
towns; Vouvray itself, Rochecorbon, Noizay and Vernou.
</P>
<P>
   In an average year, about a million cases of Vouvray are made,
half of it sparkling wine. All Vouvray is made from the chenin
blanc grape, which the French call simply chenin because, as its
name implies, it is a white grape; there is no red chenin.
</P>
<P>
   In much of the world, chenin has an indifferent reputation. In
South Africa, where it is called Steen, many growers are beginning
to replace it with chardonnay. In California's hot Central Valley,
it produces a soft, flabby wine fit mostly for jugs, but a few
North Coast producers, including Dry Creek and Chappellet
Vineyards, make surprisingly good table wines from it.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Vouvray is known as a mostly indifferent
sparkling wine. In fact, most producers in Vouvray make more
sparking wine than anything else, counting on it to pay their
bills. There are some excellent sparkling wines, but few are
exported.
</P>
<P>
   The best Vouvrays are still wines. They range from dry to sweet
and are often wines of immense breed and complexity, capable of
improving over astonishing stretches of time. A 50-year-old Vouvray
can be as fruity and rich as a five-year-old chardonnay, and some
cellars here still hold a few bottles near or at the century mark.
</P>
<P>
   Chenin is a big producer, but the Champalous have a knack for
keeping the yields low. Indeed, it takes character to keep trimming
it back. In some instances, as in 1996, a particularly sunny
growing season helps out; water in the fruit evaporates, leaving
only concentrated juice. Some Vouvrays are helped along by
botrytis, the famous noble rot of Sauternes, but the fogs that
carry it are less common here in the Touraine wine region than they
are south of Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
   The Champalous have produced some extraordinary botrytized
wines, but do not count on it for producing good wines. In the
cellar, Champalou works slowly. Grapes are pressed for up to five
hours, and fermentation can last three months or more. Dry wines
are aged in stainless steel, sweet wines in oak barrels, never much
longer than nine months. Among Champalou's finest Vouvrays are his
Cuvee des Fondraux and Cuvee CC.
</P>
<P>
   Both are sweet wines, the Fondraux less so than the CC, and both
are made from grapes picked by the trie system used in Sauternes.
Pickers go through the vineyards as many as six times over a 10-day
period, selecting only the perfectly ripe grapes each time. The
Cuvee CC, which is sold only in half-liter bottles, is a wine for
the ages, and probably shouldn't even be sampled until it's 10
years old.
</P>
<P>
   The Champalous, like most Vouvrillons, make sparkling Vouvray,
but theirs is not a commercial, cash-flow wine. Made in the classic
methode champenoise, it is a rich, elegant wine that easily
outclasses many supermarket Champagnes.
</P>
<P>
   So seek out the Champalou wines, but keep some other fine
Vouvray producers on your shopping list, too, among them Huet,
Domaine des Aubuisieres, Marc Bredif, Francois Pinon and Clos
Baudoin.
</P>
<P>
   As for me, I won't wait 14 more years to go back to Vouvray, and
next time, I will definitely see Huet. Thank goodness he didn't
stop the high-speed trains completely. The local train station, in
Tours, is only an hour from Paris now _ even with that detour
around the Vouvray vines.

   NEW YORK _ Anyone who is panting for the local tomato season to
begin has already missed its opening. For true tomato fans, the
season begins when the first green tomatoes arrive at the markets.
And they have.
</P>
<P>
   I know, I know. Green tomatoes are not eaten in the spring but
in the fall, when the ripe ones are waning. But when Joel Patraker,
the assistant director of the Greenmarket program in New York City,
waxes poetic about green tomatoes, you will rush out and buy them
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a balance of citrus and sweetness,'' he said. ``There
is a lot of juiciness and a fragrance, and they do get the
characteristic hints of pineapple and chardonnay. People are
missing the boat because they don't know what to do with them.''
</P>
<P>
   They could do what Patraker does: saute cornmeal-coated slices
of the tomatoes and layer them in a sandwich with slices of dry
goat cheese. While frying is the traditional way of preparing them,
especially in the South, they can also be baked, which gives them
the texture of eggplant, or used in a sauce.
</P>
<P>
   At Savoy, in Manhattan, the chef, Peter Hoffman, likes green
tomatoes because ``they speak to both ends of the season, '' he
said. Hoffman, who makes a point of cooking with local ingredients,
recently offered veal scaloppine with green tomatoes, which, he
said, ``bring a bright acid flavor to a dish.'' Sometimes he chars
them as he would tomatillos, the small green fruits that lie hidden
beneath papery skins and are so popular in Mexican cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Romano, the chef at Union Square Cafe, serves a green
tomato sauce with salmon that has been marinated in a chili rub.
``One of the things I love most about Indian food is the exquisite
balance between sweetness and acidity which I find in a green
tomato,'' he said. ``And it cuts through the richness of the
salmon.''
</P>
<P>
   You will not find green tomatoes on the menu at Gotham Bar and
Grill, but its chef and owner, Alfred Portale, frequently grills
them at home because he has so many tomato plants.
</P>
<P>
   He cuts them in half and marinates them for a couple of hours in
a mixture of extra virgin olive oil, garlic, shallots, thyme, salt
and pepper and then grills them, cut side down, just until they
brown. Then he turns them, moves them to the side of the grill,
away from the direct heat, and lets them continue to cook until
they are very soft and pulpy. He advises handling them carefully
when transferring them to slices of grilled bread.
</P>
<P>
   If you have green tomatoes in your garden, do not pick them
until they are heavy and have a little bit of give; picked too
soon, the tomatoes will be like cardboard.
</P>
<P>
   Green tomatoes have a place of honor on the menu at the City
Bakery, where Ilene Rosen, the savory chef, coats them with crumbs
from the cafe's own corn bread, bakes them and then serves them
with a tomato-yogurt sauce and slices of Cheddar cheese.
</P>
<P>
   They will soon appear in sandwich form on an onion Parker House
roll. With or without the bread, the combination is utterly simple,
utterly summer, utterly American.

PALMEIRO PLAYS HERO'S ROLE AGAIN IN RANGERS VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Texas Rangers departed for their six scheduled
interleague games at Arizona's Bank One Ballpark and Los Angeles'
Dodger Stadium with this question:
</P>
<P>
   Could Rafael Palmeiro emerge as a factor?
</P>
<P>
   The answer: yes.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro, who Saturday made his season debut at first base and
drove in six runs on the strength of two homers during the Rangers'
9-8 victory against the Diamondbacks, delivered again.
</P>
<P>
   Eighth-inning singles by Palmeiro and catcher Ivan Rodriguez off
right-hander Ismael Valdes propelled the Rangers to a 3-2 victory
Monday night against the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I can help this team. I know what I can do,''
Palmeiro said.
</P>
<P>
   Those two clutch, one-out base hits scored second baseman Mark
McLemore and right fielder Juan Gonzalez, and right-hander Aaron
Sele (6-4) pitched seven strong innings before the Rangers' 1-2
bullpen punch of Jeff Zimmerman and closer John Wetteland preserved
the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro started 51 of the Rangers' first 53 games as the
designated hitter while allowing his right knee heal sufficiently
for his return to the field. Palmeiro underwent arthroscopic
surgery Feb. 10 and March 7 to remove torn meniscus from the knee,
and those surgeries restricted the lateral movement required to
play defensively.
</P>
<P>
   However, interleague games played in National League ballparks
prohibit the designated hitter. Palmeiro, though, made his third
consecutive start as the Rangers' first baseman and again made a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   So did Sele, who surrendered only two runs on five hits and did
not issue a walk during an economic, seven-inning appearance that
required only 80 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had good command of . He could throw it anytime he
wanted,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said of Sele. ``Not too many
guys throw 80-pitch ballgames, other than Maddux, and it could've
been.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that I feel like I'm throwing the ball
better than I did earlier in the year,'' Sele said.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Todd Zeile, who Saturday committed a fifth-inning
error that led to three unearned runs during the Rangers' 4-2 loss
to the Arizona Diamondbacks, delivered the game's first run.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile's two-out, second-inning double snapped his 0-for-18 slump
and scored Juan Gonzalez, who led off the inning with a line-drive
single to right field off Valdes (5-4).
</P>
<P>
   Sele entered the seventh inning with a three-hit shutout intact,
but center fielder Trenidad Hubbard _ who replaced the injured
Devon White in the fourth inning _ led off the inning with a
well-hit ball to center field.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers center fielder Tom Goodwin, perhaps the American
League's fastest player, chased the ball into deep left-center
field. The ball, though, deflected off Goodwin's outstretched
glove, and Hubbard coasted into second base with the leadoff
double.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard advanced to third when Rodriguez's pickoff attempt
eluded shortstop Royce Clayton and bounced into center field. Sele,
though, induced the first of two consecutive ground balls with the
infield in from third baseman Adrian Beltre.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard could not score on Beltre's ground ball, but the one off
the bat of catcher Angel Pena was not hit hard enough for Clayton
to make a play at the plate. Clayton fielded the ball on the
infield grass and retired Pena while Hubbard scored the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman replaced Sele after Eric Young's leadoff single in the
eighth inning, and the right-handed reliever worked out of a
one-out, bases-loaded jam to preserve the Rangers' one-run lead
after Eric Karros' sacrifice fly. Wetteland pitched a scoreless
ninth for his major-league-best 20th save. nn

ZUBOV BREAKS SILENCE, BUT ONLY ON ORDERS OF NHL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA, JENNIFER FLOYD, JIM REEVES, DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ AND
MEDE NIX 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sergei Zubov broke his media ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NHL made me,'' the Dallas Stars defenseman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He has made a policy of not talking to the media during the
playoffs. He talked during the Stars' second-round series against
St. Louis, and not long thereafter made a turnover that led to the
Blues' game-winning goal in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk, bad things happen,'' Zubov said. ONE HOT POWER
PLAY
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres have 15 power-play goals in 16 games. They score on
almost one of every four attempts. So what are the Stars to do if
they find themselves shorthanded?
</P>
<P>
   ``We should do what we've been doing,'' winger Jere Lehtinen
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars lead the NHL in penalty-kill percentage, negating 91.3
percent of the power plays they have faced. The secret, Lehtinen
said, is being aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are like St. Louis: They shoot a lot from the point,''
Lehtinen said. ``We have to get pressure.'' FAVORED AND PROUD OF IT
</P>
<P>
   Coach Ken Hitchcock said the Stars deserve to be favored in the
Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in first place since day one,'' he said. ``We
deserve the accolades and the pressure that goes along with being
favored.'' MARSHALL, HOGUE LIKELY OUT
</P>
<P>
   Winger Grant Marshall could be out for an extended period with
an injured left groin muscle, joining winger Benoit Hogue as
unlikely to play in the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said that he considers himself ``day-to-day'' and that
he's not sure whether he can return for the Finals. Marshall, a
native of Mississauga, Ontario, said he's working to get tickets
for his parents to Game 3 and 4 in Buffalo, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hitchcock reiterated that Hogue is not expected to play, but
Hogue said he is postponing surgery until after the Finals on the
rare chance that he might return.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said team doctors have advised Hogue, who tore the
anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligaments in his left knee
May 24, not to play, and he does not expect to put Hogue in the
lineup under any circumstance. HULL AMBIGUOUS
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull isn't changing his tune for the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   He knows the checking-oriented scheme of Ken Hitchcock works;
he's just not thrilled playing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's like every sport,'' Hull said, pointing to the
NBA. ``All they talk about is defense wins. I think that is what
will always be the case. I am openly against it, but it is a
situation where you go out and you play. It is not up to us as
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull said that, in emphasizing his defensive style, Hitchcock
``is hard on you. He drives you. He's relentless. He'll ride you
until you play his way.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he doesn't expect changes in that style.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to live and die with it,'' Hull said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hull said he is having ``a lot of fun this year,'' and is
firmly convinced that the system works, especially after the Stars'
sloppy defense in Game 5 of the Western Conference finals caused
them to give up seven goals to Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing that ever happened to us was losing Game 5,''
Hull said. NO WAGERING, PLEASE
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Mayor Ron Kirk said he doesn't know whether he'll place a
bet with the mayor of Buffalo on the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that Buffalo's got anything else to offer after
two Super Bowl losses to the Cowboys,'' Kirk said, noting the
Dallas Cowboys' two blowout Super Bowl wins against the Buffalo
Bills in 1992 and 1993. ``We've got just about all the Buffalo
wings we need.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a bet, Kirk said, it might be for something simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we'll have a bet to fly the other's flag over City Hall
for a day,'' he said. RIBS VS. CHICKEN WINGS
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush wagered barbecue ribs and brisket
against New York Gov. George Pataki's 100 Buffalo chicken wings and
a dozen roast beef, gravy and horseradish ``Beef on Weck''
sandwiches that the Stars will beat the Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   Bush expressed confidence in the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dallas Stars will prevail and bring the Stanley Cup to
Texas where it rightfully belongs,'' Bush said. WORK ETHIC
</P>
<P>
   The key to beating the Sabres is simple, Ken Hitchcock said _
outwork goalie Dominic Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to win bad enough, you have to outwork the best
player, and the best player is the goalie,'' Hitchcock said. ``We
learned our lesson two years ago (against Edmonton) with (Curtis)
Joseph. We didn't outwork him, we didn't out-battle him in front of
the net, and we didn't win.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're prepared to outwork this guy, we'll get our offensive
opportunities, and we'll get our goals. If not, if we just get
discouraged and walk away after one shot, we're not going to be
very good.'' nn

WAR OF WORDS STEMS FROM MODANO'S `LETDOWN' TALK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Inside the Stars Club on Monday, the atmosphere was
festive, downright party-like as media members from across the
nation feasted on food and the quotes of the Dallas Stars and
Buffalo Sabres players.
</P>
<P>
   But while the press went home happy, it appeared the
participants had a little heartburn.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Finals at 7 p.m. Tuesday
at Reunion Arena, players and coaches from both sides tossed barbs
across the media throng. The acrimony began Saturday with ``The
Buffalo News'' printing comments from Stars center Mike Modano
saying he thought fans were anticipating a bit of a letdown going
into the finals from the Colorado Avalanche to the seventh-seeded
Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   Modano said Monday he was simply answering a question and didn't
mean to disparage the Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nothing to light a fire under them,'' Modano said. ``I
don't want to get into a war of words. Grade me the way I play, not
the way I talk.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres have decided to do exactly that. And right now,
Sabres coach Lindy Ruff isn't handing out high grades to Modano.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can play anybody against Modano. He hasn't given anyone any
problems lately,'' Ruff said.
</P>
<P>
   Modano had just one goal in the seven-game Western Conference
finals series with the Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   But Stars coach Ken Hitchcock fired back his own volley. When
asked if the Stars would struggle with Sabres center Michael Peca,
a Selke Trophy finalist who likely will check Modano, Hitchcock
responded:
</P>
<P>
   ``Modano is about to become a 30-minute player. He's not going
to play 20 minutes, not with four games left in the season,''
Hitchcock said. ``He's going to be a 30-minute player. So if Peca
can play 30 minutes, bring it on. Let's go.''
</P>
<P>
   In between, Sabres players criticized the bad ice at Reunion
Arena and said the Stars were ``cheaters'' in the faceoff circle.
Ruff talked about getting into the head of Stars goalie Ed Belfour,
and Stars center Brian Skrudland pondered possible psychological
tactics against Sabres goalie Dominik Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, both claimed that what is supposed to be a
``boring'' finals series between two defensive hockey teams will at
least have intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be an instant rivalry as soon as the puck is
dropped,'' Ruff said. nn

SYDOR, ZHITNIK WERE FIRST FRIENDS, NOW ON-ICE FOES
</HEADLINE>
 FOES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAULA CABALLERO 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Fresh off the plane from Ukraine and in Los Angeles as
a Kings rookie in 1992, Alexei Zhitnik described himself as ``a guy
from another planet.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he crossed paths with Darryl Sydor, who became Zhitnik's
roommate, defensive mate with the Kings and interplanetary tour
guide. Sydor taught Zhitnik, both 20 at the time, the ways of the
NHL world, and together they figured they would become the core of
a Stanley Cup defense.
</P>
<P>
   Why not when the Kings made the Finals that season before losing
to the Montreal Canadiens?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I was really understanding what kind of level we
were playing at,'' Zhitnik said. ``I had a lot of guys around me
with four and five Stanley Cup rings. Maybe I thought it was easy
to get to the finals. I thought maybe it's not going to happen
every year, but every second year I can play for the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time showed me I was wrong, and it took me another seven
years, same as Darryl Sydor, to get that opportunity again.''
</P>
<P>
   Former LA Kings coach Barry Melrose remembers Zhitnik and Sydor
as ``best friends,'' along with defenseman Rob Blake. Melrose
remembers the time Zhitnik purchased a Lexus with cash and
proceeded to drive it around Los Angeles with no American driver's
license.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a lot of stuff like that right off the bat,'' Melrose
said. ``He didn't know. He never had money like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydor said he enjoyed the process of assimilating Zhitnik to
life in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I taught him a few things about what was going on,''
Sydor said. ``He liked the busy life. LA was a good fit for him. He
had fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Zhitnik: ``I really wasn't speaking English first of all,''
Zhitnik said. ``It was probably a lot of hell for him. I can say he
probably babysit me once in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhitnik, who is from the Ukraine, reminisced about eating
Ukrainian meals in Edmonton at Sydor's home.
</P>
<P>
   ``His grandparents speak Ukrainian pretty good,'' Zhitnik said.
</P>
<P>
   The friends were not defensive partners with the Kings, but
shared plenty of ice-time in Melrose's four-man defensive rotation
that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were unbelievable,'' Melrose said. ``We would have never
gotten to the finals without Zhitnik and Sydor.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydor and Zhitnik differ in their defensive styles, however.
Sydor, who has two goals and nine assists in the playoffs, is a
battler, Melrose said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves to play in pressure situations,'' Melrose said. ``He
wants to be the guy with the puck, that's what leaders do. He's
somebody you're proud of every night; he never lets you down.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhitnik, who has three goals and nine assists, bears more
resemblance to a Sergei Zubov-type defenseman with more grit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is one of the best skaters in the world,'' Melrose said.
``He could put up huge offensive numbers on the right team. I'm
talking 20 goals and 70 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he is very, very brave. Right from the start, he was going
head-to-head against these big Canadian forwards and not giving an
inch.''
</P>
<P>
   While the two spent a little time together at the All-Star game
this year, Zhitnik said he hoped there would be time to reunite
with his old friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``East and West is kind of far away to keep in touch,'' Zhitnik
said.
</P>
<P>
   At least the two are now on the same planet. nn

GM GAINEY HAS BUILT THE STARS IN HIS IMAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Bob Gainey's finger twitched for a moment. He
wanted to react to what he thought was a bad call, he wanted to
find justice, the same way he did in his playing days with the
Montreal Canadiens _ with a covert elbow or a deftly turned stick
to the ribs.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't. The Stars general manager sat still after his
team had a crucial Pat Verbeek goal disallowed in Game 2 of the
Western Conference finals. Gainey didn't rush to the replay booth
to voice his opinion. He didn't demand to get NHL commissioner Gary
Bettman on the telephone to ``save the integrity of the game,'' as
Colorado Avalanche general manager Pierre LaCroix had done when his
team was stung by a disallowed goal in Game 1 of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Gainey sat. And waited. And won.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Nieuwendyk scored in the third period. So did Mike Modano.
The Stars took a hard-fought 4-2 victory in a game in which Gainey
believes his team deserved one more goal. So why didn't he rush to
the rescue of his players?
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we were going to score,'' he said with a wink.
</P>
<P>
   And with that, the general manager turned and walked away.
</P>
<P>
   In a few words, Gainey said it all. In a few words, he summed up
his control, his confidence, his belief in what he is doing. In a
few words, Gainey summed up the Stars organization. And he walked
away _ knowing that the real message was delivered in his stride,
not in his words.
</P>
<P>
   Crack the Stars open and they bleed Gainey's blood. Look for a
reason to explain why a team that three years ago missed the
playoffs is in the 1999 Stanley Cup Finals, and the fingers all
seem to point to Gainey. Yes, the money of owner Tom Hicks is
crucial. Yes, Ken Hitchcock's coaching style has been
indispensable. Yes, the talents of Mike Modano, Joe Nieuwendyk and
others win games on the ice. But the core of that success has been
in the organization since 1990, when a five-time Stanley Cup
champion and first-ballot Hall of Famer was plucked from a French
semipro league and named coach of the Minnesota North Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the fabric of this organization, there are hundreds of
threads that weave back and forth,'' assistant coach Rick Wilson
said. ``But most of those threads have been touched by Bob
Gainey.''
</P>
<P>
   Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Finals is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m.
Tuesday at Reunion Arena. The Western Conference champion Stars
will play the Buffalo Sabres before 17,001 boisterous fans looking
for any extra advantage. They might want to turn an eye to the
press box, where Gainey will be quietly sitting, jotting down
notes, seemingly doing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Appearances couldn't be more wrong. Behind the scenes, Stars
center Guy Carbonneau praised Gainey's ability to adapt the lessons
of the Canadiens to a different kind of NHL. Stars defenseman Craig
Ludwig talks about Gainey's integrity as a general manager and his
ability to make the Stars a franchise ``where players really want
to play.'' Stars captain Derian Hatcher looks at the Stars'
victories in Games 6 and 7 against the Avalanche and cites his
team's character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we could have come back in Game 6 or won Game 7
without character, and I think a lot of that has had to do with
Bob,'' Hatcher said. ``When he's signed guys or drafted guys or
traded for guys, he's looked for character players, and I think you
see that in this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Gainey chuckles when people talk about his stoic appearance, his
calm hand. Hitchcock has calmed under Gainey's guidance, he's told.
Ed Belfour has found peace because of the Stars' no-panic
environment. They are calm, the theory goes, because Gainey is
calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I may show you that calm side,'' Gainey said. ``But
there are times I have to close the door and sit down and say to
myself, `What the heck am I doing here?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gainey did that at the trade deadline when he refused to panic
and sign a high-dollar rent-a-player while the Avalanche and
Detroit Red Wings went on spending sprees. Gainey said he wasn't
sure he was making the right decision. But he said his heart told
him to ``trust the players, trust what we had built.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the decision looks good. But as he always does, Gainey
paints his team in shades of gray and not black and white. In
truth, crediting Gainey with the transitions of Hitchcock and
Belfour is simple-minded. It takes away from the immense individual
accomplishments of the coach and goalie.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why Gainey is so important to the Stars. He doesn't
seem to get wrapped up in his own worth. He doesn't overemphasize
victories or losses. He looks at the good and the bad of each
situation and appreciates both.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Bob is more than anything for the coaches and the players
and the whole organization, is he's big-picture,'' Hitchcock said.
``We might get caught up in the minutiae of the day, but Bob has a
way of looking through all of that. Bob has a great way of stepping
back from any situation and studying it from every angle.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Bob does for us is he has a way of never losing sight of
the goal.'' nn

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I was sitting on a plush velvet sofa, a low oval
coffee table before me, in a room with a low ceiling and dim random
lighting. It was no different from a living room, a very nice
living room, where I would have been happy just to sit and relax.
</P>
<P>
   But this was a restaurant, Soma Park on the Upper East Side.
</P>
<P>
   The server handed me a linen napkin and flatware, and I was
about to experience a whole new way of dining. Sitting on that
sofa, plate on my knees, just as I might eat at home, I lingered
over seared hamachi with braised artichokes and a melon
vinaigrette, and then roasted loin of veal with fava beans,
cosseted all the while by an attentive staff.
</P>
<P>
   It was a strange experience _ and a strangely addictive one.
Living room and kitchen had fused. I had a sophisticated meal and
impeccable service without any formality.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of casual dining that you might expect to find
in the East Village, not in the East 50s. But Soma Park is just one
of many restaurants, from downtown lounges to restaurants with
caviar service, packing in the sofas and cushy chairs for dining in
living room style. In a city where few apartments even have dining
rooms, finding ways to recreate the warmth of home has led even
luxurious dining spots like Daniel to start serving food in the
lounge area in the last month or so.
</P>
<P>
   Eating in these appealing spaces can sometimes be awkward and
tricky, but the food is often good, sometimes surprisingly so, with
smaller portions and lower prices than in the dining room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's terrific,'' said Susy Davidson, co-publisher of
the Briefing, a restaurant industry newsletter. ``I see it as being
American and wanting it all in blue jeans but I think it's also, `I
want it great and I want it on my terms.'''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, restaurant dining has lost much of its rigid
structure, becoming a malleable concept that can be sculptured into
any form the restaurateur wants. As diners yearned for better food
with less formality, restaurant designers began creating more
casual, often whimsical, dining spaces. Soon afterward, they began
serving small appetizers and eventually full meals at the bar.
Recreating home-like environments, then, is just a natural
evolution from eating at the bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the fast-paced times and people not sitting down for long
dinners, it allows for flexibility,'' said John Elliott Sime, the
owner of Sime &AMP; Mandel, a design firm in East Atlantic Beach that
designed Alaia, a new restaurant in Greenwich Village. Small groups
can have a more intimate setting, he said; people can come and go.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real operative here is living room,'' Ms. Davidson said.
``A great number of younger Americans have grown up with
restaurants as their living room.''
</P>
<P>
   People use restaurants in many different ways. Some like to sit
alone and read while having a few small dishes. Others like to
bring in friends and entertain instead of doing it at home. Cushy
lounges simply welcome these alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   In the lounge at Daniel, for instance, people often reserve
small enclaves of gray sofas and rust-colored chairs at lunch for
birthday and anniversary parties. Why have a party at home when you
can indulge in a place that feels as relaxed as home but looks part
palazzo, part Park Avenue apartment?
</P>
<P>
   Many of these lounges make you feel like you're in a fantasy
living room that has the energy and fizz of a cocktail party. And
because you needn't _ and most times can't _ reserve in advance or
dress up, there is something deliciously indulgent about dining in
them.
</P>
<P>
   Show up at Firebird on Restaurant Row, for instance, and you are
immediately transported to the parlor of a wealthy family home in
Russia. There are gilt framed sofas, velvet divans, urns, busts and
yards of brocade. You can order off the regular menu, but it is the
perfect setting for zakuska, or small dishes, like beet and apple
salad and herring in sour cream with buckwheat blini. Waiters cover
the antique tables, which are held up by reed thin legs, with
linens and serve the blini in a covered silver dish. Vodka is
poured in chilled, elegant fluted glasses. You can sip and recline
and there is no expectation to order more or to turn the table.
</P>
<P>
   Le Colonial in midtown is more a place in which to hide.
Upstairs, the lounge is dim, lighted by a few lamps that shed a
soft yellow light and narrow shafts of sunlight that squeeze
through the front windows. Large palm-like plants enclose the small
plots of emerald green cushioned wicker sofas and chairs. It is a
place to sink in, smoke and graze on vibrant, bluntly flavored
dishes like grilled eggplant with basil or artichoke and crab salad
with rice crackers.
</P>
<P>
   The French-Vietnamese fare at Le Colonial, as with many ethnic
foods, lends itself to light eating and sharing at small tables. In
fact, restaurants like the pan-Asian Rain and the Turkish Pasha
have long maintained casual, lounge-like settings.
</P>
<P>
   Some lounges have less of a point of view. In the East Village,
the upstairs lounge at Velvet feels part coffeehouse, part
Victorian home, part bar. Heavy antique furniture is arranged in
what seems like three separate living rooms. There are magazine
racks, a long bar and a menu with no particular bent. There is
salmon tartare _ a two-level disk with salmon and shredded cucumber
_ and steak au poivre, as well as simple country dishes like a pure
pea soup.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go to so many different places, so many different lounges
and the furniture is really, really ugly and uncomfortable,'' Louis
Donato, an owner of Velvet, said. ``I wanted more of a parlor
setting. People can come here for many different things.'' Eating,
drinking, even a game of chess, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although styles vary, the lounge concept is spreading like a
rumor. Several restaurants with comfortable lounge areas are
scheduled to open in the next few months. Coup, in the East
Village, is converting its basement room into a lounge with a
separate menu. The Landmark Club, a new restaurant on the Upper
East Side, has just opened up. And Southwest NY in the World
Financial Center is opening with a lounge outdoors. Yes, sofas on
the sidewalk, like in college.
</P>
<P>
   Lounge areas may appear to have less structure than a
restaurant, but most of these scattered sofas and tight groupings
of stools and benches are carefully set down. ``We were really more
concerned with conversations,'' Sime, who designed Alaia, said.
``We wanted almost a living room atmosphere where one group could
meld into another and it wouldn't be so rigid.''
</P>
<P>
   The choice of sofa is also important. ``You have to sink,'' John
Scotto, the owner of Soma Park, said. ``It can't be something
that's hard. When you sit in a couch it's a little sexy, it's a
little romantic.'' A comfortable sofa, he said, allows people to
let down their guard and relax. He chose small love seats for a
Venetian-style room in the front of the restaurant, and oversize
swivel chairs for the spacious French-style back room.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Donato, who furnished the lounge at Velvet with some of his own
living room furniture, said: ``Tables can sometimes be more a
barrier than anything else.'' The tables there, and in many
lounges, are often low, small or practically nonexistent. In the
tiny space upstairs at Savoy in SoHo, where there is no table,
servers prop the food directly on the sofa. In the salon at the
SoHo Grand Hotel, they've placed the dishes on any available
surface, including cushioned stools.
</P>
<P>
   Which presents a special challenge when you try to disassemble a
leg of roasted chicken. Though it may feel all right to hover over
your coffee table at home while you watch the evening news, trying
to do that and look good in a restaurant is another story. You need
either to learn to balance a plate in one hand and eat with the
other or to keep the plate level on your knees. If you're really
coordinated, you can also wield a glass of wine. You just might not
want to wear your best pair of pants.
</P>
<P>
   It is a skill worth acquiring, though, considering what great
food can be had in restaurant lounges. At Daniel, the lounge menu
offers a ``plateaux'' for two. The charcuterie arrives on one level
of a three-tiered plate stand with three tiny bowls of soup on top
_ pea, a capon curry gelee and asparagus _ and salads on the second
tier. A handful of charcuterie dishes like oxtail and foie gras
terrine and chicken ballottine are on the bottom plate.
</P>
<P>
   You can also order ``tastes,'' or half orders of appetizers,
full appetizers and main courses, all derived from the regular
restaurant menu. They are not cafe versions of the menu, but Daniel
in jeans, you could say.
</P>
<P>
   You can just drop in and have a sommelier on your left offering
suggestions, a waiter on your right setting down a plate of
fabulous little flavors, and under you a beautifully designed sofa.
</P>
<P>
   And you don't even have to sit up straight.

RANGERS MANAGER SHUFFLES ROTATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Right-hander Rick Helling, the only member of the
Texas Rangers' rotation with an earned-run average better than
5.00, could gain an additional start before the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates made that a possibility Monday by
scheduling Helling (5-6, 4.81) to start Friday's game against the
Colorado Rockies at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers will skip right-hander Ryan Glynn (0-0, 8.66)
through the rotation this time in order for Helling to start
Friday, when the Rangers begin a stretch of 20 games scheduled for
20 days. Helling will be required to pitch once with three days
rest this month to gain a seventh start before the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to give a guy an extra start,'' Oates said,
``he should be the one to get it.'' MORGAN SET TO RETURN
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers plan to reinstate right-hander Mike Morgan
(inflammation, right leg) from the 15-day disabled list for his
scheduled start tonight against the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan experienced no significant difficulties during his
20-minute bullpen session Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good again,'' Morgan said. ``I don't have the pain. I'm
not 100 percent, but I'll be fine as long as I can push off the
rubber, cover first base and back up home plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Danny Kolb, whom the Rangers recalled Wednesday
from Triple-A Oklahoma, likely will be optioned to Oklahoma to make
room for Morgan on the 25-man roster. UN-CLEMENS-LIKE
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Roger Clemens lost for the first time since May 19,
1998, with the Yankees' 7-2 loss Sunday to the Mets. Sixteen
pitchers have lost at least once while pitching for the Rangers
during Clemens' 20-game winning streak. The list includes: Pitcher
Losses Aaron Sele 13 John Burkett 12 Rick Helling 12 Xavier
Hernandez 6 Esteban Loaiza 6 Mark Clark 4 Mike Morgan 4 Danny
Patterson 4 Todd Stottlemyre 4 Eric Gunderson 3 Darren Oliver 3
Matt Perisho 2 Todd Van Poppel 2 John Wetteland 2 Bobby Witt 2 Tim
Crabtree 1 while pitching for the Rangers
MORE DRAFTEES SIGNED
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers on Monday agreed to terms with three players
selected during last week's 1999 First-Year Player Draft and one
undrafted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Among those included their third-round selection, infielder Hank
Blalock of Rancho Bernardo (Calif.) High School. The Rangers also
agreed to terms with Shippensburg State University right-hander
Victor Hillaert and Kennesaw State University outfielder Jason
Jones, their fifth- and 13th-round selections, respectively. The
Rangers also signed University of Alabama-Huntsville left-hander
Jamie Hill, an undrafted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers assigned Blalock, Hillaert and Hill to their
rookie-league affiliate in the Gulf Coast League. Jones will report
to Pulaski, the Rangers' rookie-league affiliate in the Appalachian
League. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers plan for left-hander Eric Gunderson to begin his
medical rehabilitation assignment Wednesday with Triple-A Oklahoma.
The Rangers placed Gunderson (0-0, 7.20) on the 15-day disabled
list May 9 with partial tears of the rotator cuff and labrum in his
left shoulder. Gunderson's rehabilitation assignment can be no
longer than 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   A limited number of seats remain for the Conversation with Hank
Aaron, scheduled for 1 p.m. Saturday at the Legends of the Game
Baseball Museum at The Ballpark in Arlington. Admission is free,
but interested parties should call (817) 273-5600 for seating
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers announced that their Aug. 12 game against the
Detroit Tigers at The Ballpark in Arlington has been rescheduled
for 6:05 p.m. instead of 7:35 p.m. The change was made to
accommodate a FOX Sports Net national broadcast. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers placed right-hander Derrick Cook of Double-A Tulsa
on the disabled list with inflammation in his right shoulder. The
Rangers promoted right-hander Matt Miller from Class-A Charlotte to
replace Cook on the Drillers' roster.

MISTAKEN IDENTITY: SABRES' SATAN WICKED IN HOCKEY DEEDS ONLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Dixon Ward remembers looking into a crowd Marine
Midland Arena in Buffalo and seeing a sign that said: ``Thank God
for Satan.''
</P>
<P>
   No, not that Satan.
</P>
<P>
   Miroslav Satan, Buffalo's leading scorer thank you very much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ``SHUH-tan'','' he corrected, emphasizing the ``sh''
sound that folks back in Topolcany, Slovakia, use when saying his
name.
</P>
<P>
   Satan used to be known as the guy with the name. Now, he has
become a guy that managed to score 40 regular-season goals for a
Sabres bunch not usually known for scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Satan brings his show to the Bible Belt when Stanley Cup Finals
play begins with Game 1 at 7 p.m. Tuesday at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Don't feel bad if this is the first time you've heard of the
stick-wielding, not pitchfork-wielding, Satan. Unlike the horned
fellow from down below with whom he shares a name, Miroslav Satan
has had a little trouble developing a reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was traded here, I was surprised with his stats,'' said
Sabres forward Joe Juneau, a March addition for Buffalo. ``You
don't hear about the guy all year, and then you are on his team and
you realize he's scoring like 40 goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Satan had personal bests in goals (40) and assists (26) this
season, and his totals were far and away better than any of his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   He looked to be ready to continue his work in the playoffs until
a bruised ankle sidelined him in Game 3 of Buffalo's opening-round
series against Ottawa. He had a pair of goals and an assist despite
only playing in two and a half games that series.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that if he had been healthy from Day 1,
he'd be leading our team in scoring,'' Sabres defenseman Jason
Woolley said.
</P>
<P>
   Woolley instead has taken on that role, although, Satan's
gaining on him fast. In his first game back, Game 3 against Toronto
in the Eastern Conference finals, Satan had a goal. He has since
added three assists.
</P>
<P>
   And now the sign reads, Satan's back.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Satan has seen them all, heard all of the jokes, the Prince
of Darkness references, the suggestions that he'd be a perfect fit
with the New Jersey Devils, the long pauses when he orders a plane
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   He laughs, saying he finds most of it amusing.
</P>
<P>
   Satan admits he had little idea of what awaited him when he came
from Slovakia. He says ``cert'' not Satan is the word for the devil
back home. So what's the big deal, he thought?
</P>
<P>
   Then, he attempted to order a pizza.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ask me: `Is this really your name?''' Satan said. ``All I
can say is that's the way it is. ... Now, I don't give last name
when I order pizza, just first name.''
</P>
<P>
   When he first signed with Edmonton, Oilers officials politely
suggested a spelling change. Maybe add an H, they suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's a different name for me,'' Satan said. ``In my
language, I would read it with an `H' and it would be a different
word. I didn't want to change.''
</P>
<P>
   What's in a name anyway?
</P>
<P>
   The Satan the Sabres know and love is described as ``quiet,''
``unassuming'' even ``goofy.'' Buffalo winger Dixon Ward said they
don't even make jokes any more in the locker room. There is no
``Saturday Night Live'' _ like wonderings of: Could it be Satan?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just too obvious,'' Ward said. ``We don't tease him
because he never says anything. We barely even know he's there.''
</P>
<P>
   Could it be Satan is just quietly going about his business?
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what he does on the ice,'' Ward said. ``The rest of
the league may not. He's not in the press a lot. He's a very quiet
guy. He's very unassuming. ... That's his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I guess, we're all Satan worshipers.'' nn

RAY ADJUSTS GOALS AFTER WEAK FINISHES
</HEADLINE>
 RAY-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Texan Greg Ray began the Pep Boys Indy
Racing League season with a realistic set of goals: four victories
and the driver's championship.
</P>
<P>
   But a string of three consecutive 21st-place finishes _
punctuated by the pit mishap that ended his day while leading the
Indianapolis 500 _ have prompted Ray to redefine his outlook for
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of what drives me is the highest of highs,'' said Ray,
the Plano, Texas, resident who is in his first full IRL season and
first with Team Menard. ``I'm not going to climb Mount Everest
every morning. We have realistic goals. But we're certainly running
out of ways that you can't win. We have to win and win in a hurry.
We're in a desperation mode as far as the championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray heads into Thursday night's qualifying session for the
Longhorn 500 at Texas Motor Speedway tied with Stephan Gregoire for
20th in driver points at 34. That is 81 behind leader Jeff Ward
with seven races remaining. Ray admittedly began the season in a
conservative mode _ partly in deference to car owner John Menard
and the organization that won the 1997 IRL championship with Tony
Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose that if you finish five or six races in a row and
win 'em all, there's potential there to catapult yourself into the
lead,'' said Ray, who is winless in 17 career IRL starts. ``But I
can forget about this conservative stuff. That probably fits my
personality better.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray said the 1.5-mile TMS quad-oval, with its 24-degree banked
turns, also is better suited to his all-out driving style.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kind of tracks fit me like a glove. These tracks are
made for gladiators,'' said Ray, 32, whose day at the Indianapolis
Motor Speedway ended when he inadvertently drove into the side of
Mark Dismore's car while exiting pit road on Lap 120. ``It was
nobody's fault but my own. It was just heartbreaking to have
something so silly like that happen. That incident took me from
achieving a childhood dream. But I'm still young enough and hungry
enough to know I can use that for experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Driving his own car and working with team manager Thomas Knapp
at TMS last June 6, Ray battled pole-winner Billy Boat nose-to-tail
and side-by-side in the closing laps en route to a career-best
second-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole race was fast and furious,'' said Ray, who finished
0.928 seconds behind Boat after 208 laps. ``I had a lot of friends
and family in the stands and there was a lot of commotion on Lap
200 because people thought the race was 200 laps. And I was leading
at 200 laps.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray said he dutifully has readjusted his goals after each
nonvictory this season. Winning at TMS on Saturday night would make
his wait much easier to justify.
</P>
<P>
   ``This track has been kind to me,'' said Ray, who is $47,000
short of reaching $1 million in earnings for his IRL career. ``When
I drive into the racetrack, people wave at me and honk at me. I'm
not the Dallas Cowboys, but I'm the local racer. We've had a lot of
well-wishers from the Internet to telephone calls and notes with my
kids from school and at church. It's exciting. It feels like a
community event.'' nn

DON'T BE TELLING STARS THEIR WAY ISN'T RIGHT ONE
</HEADLINE>

By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ We come to you today, O' Great and Magnificent
Guardians of the mighty National Hockey League, with 10-gallon
Stetsons in hand. Forgive us, we beseech you, for having the brass
to crash saintly Lord Stanley's party.
</P>
<P>
   We promise not to spike the punch or puke in your shiny silver
chalice. Well, at least not before the Dallas Stars win it, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   After that, we'll do what we damn well please.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, we've come to the dance in our faded Wranglers and
scuffed-up Justins but don't go sticking your noses in the air and
acting like you're not counting on Fort Worth-Dallas to carry your
royal Canadian behinds in the TV ratings. We know better.
</P>
<P>
   And that baloney about the Stars giving the NHL a black eye
because they take the air out of the puck? You can take that and
stick it ... well, I suppose Brett Hull has already mapped that
geographic route out for you eloquently enough.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL came to Texas sporting that same shiner six years ago.
You want more offense in your league? Lower the pitching mound and
juice the puck. It's worked wonders for baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, shut up and let Bob Gainey and Ken Hitchcock take
care of the hockey bidness around here. They seem to know a little
bit about it, having disposed of the league's pet team, the
Colorado Avalanche, which in turn had done a number on the two-time
defending champion Detroit Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have done what any team and any coach should do:
Figured out how to win with their personnel. Sure, maybe Mike
Modano could be the next Wayne Gretzky in another system. Why don't
you ask him, right now, if he'd trade his chance at that big shiny
cup for that ``maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many inches to fill in their columns,'' Gainey grumbled
Monday about the so-called experts who have tried to make the Stars
the villains of these playoffs. ``This happens every year with
every team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the first pick in the draft. When he's marked, 18
months before as the No. 1 guy, by the time he gets to draft day
he's got a lot of problems because you've had 18 months to pick him
apart and find out what his problems are. We all have them and our
team has them but we play with what we've got and we do it pretty
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Ken Hitchcock, in fact, came to the Stars with an
offensive resume. His last junior team averaged ``seven'' goals per
game. His K-Wings would run-and-gun with anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really arrogant and made a big mistake when I first came
here,'' Hitchcock said. ``I put my system in for this team and we
couldn't play it. We were smaller and quicker at Kalamazoo and we
could afford to gamble a little more and I put that system in place
when I got here and we got burned a lot in the first half of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I changed to a system closer to what Bob had and somewhere
between the two systems we've reached a compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   The change, Hitch said, was dictated by the personnel he had at
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to play a more aggressive system but you need
footspeed to play more aggressive, so based on our personnel,
that's the way we play,'' he said. ``The philosophy is more
five-pack, almost like wolves, mentality. We're either all up
together or all back together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to play, in a zone, very tight together, and we don't
have any space between the forwards and the defensemen. We want to
take the middle of the ice away, make them play east-west and don't
allow them to come north-south. We want to take away half the ice.
They want to play on 80 feet; we give them 40.''
</P>
<P>
   And please, before you accuse of the Stars of playing a boring,
``trap'' defense, you should have some clue what you're talking
about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure there are 10 hockey writers who really know what
the trap is,'' Hitchcock said, ``but we don't play it. We play a
1-2-2 forecheck. There's only one team left in the league who plays
a 2-1-2 forecheck and that's Edmonton. Some teams play a `high'
1-2-2, which is the trap, and some people play the `low' and we
play the `low,' just like Buffalo does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get offended when people say that because we protect the
lead well, because we play well without the puck, that somehow
we're a disappointment to the league. As a coach, I don't tell my
players how to play with the puck. They know how to play with the
puck. I tell them how to play without the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's'' what sets the Stars apart from most teams in this
league.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if it's Brett Hull or Mike Modano, there are
certain rules to playing without the puck,'' Hitchcock said. ``When
you don't have discipline without the puck, it's like telling your
defensive team in the NFL that the other team has the ball so go
wherever you want.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or (in baseball) it's like telling your three outfielders to
stand where they want. To me, that's what makes a coach in the
National Hockey League _ how you get your team to play without the
puck.''
</P>
<P>
   That's our coach. He's not a sleek former NHL star, like some
others are and he has a little weight problem. It's part of his
charm. Any day now Ty will issue the official Ken Hitchcock Beanie
Baby.
</P>
<P>
   He took the family dog for a walk the other day and it, well, to
put it bluntly, peed on his foot.
</P>
<P>
   He gets no respect, but he has promised to change his socks
before taking his spot behind the Stars bench Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   We like him _ and his system _ because he wins and, as has been
well documented, this is a winner's town.
</P>
<P>
   Relax. Have a chicken-fried steak or some barbecue while you're
here. Or some real bacon _ we know the difference between bacon and
ham _ with your eggs.
</P>
<P>
   We're still a little rough around the edges on this hockey thing
but you might has well learn to live with us, guys.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, we're here to stay. nn

TATTOOS, NOSE STUDS A LITTLE TOO EDGY FOR BARBIE AND GANG 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CINNAMON BAIR   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKELAND, Fla. _ She meant to appear avant garde.
</P>
<P>
   The giant butterfly tattoo on her tiny midriff represented the
height of fashion for today's teens and young adults. All her
friends had butterfly tattoos, even her boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Butterfly Art Barbie'' just didn't fly.
</P>
<P>
   So the first Barbie doll to sport a permanent tattoo has been
taken out of production by Mattel due to parental outcry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just had some consumers who didn't like it,'' said Lisa
McKendall, director of communications for Mattel. ``We always want
to try and be responsive to our dolls' audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents, many of whom bristle at the thought of their teen-agers
getting tattoos and piercings, didn't appreciate it when their
little girls' best-loved doll, and her doll friends like Ken,
decided to sport body art.
</P>
<P>
   The Barbie dolls _ maligned for years for their outrageous body
proportions _ were again sending the wrong message about the human
body to children, said parents and critics alike. She seemed to be
saying girls couldn't be pretty, cool or accepted unless they
decorated their bodies in some way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pierced ears and tattoos and so forth: They are not part of
what children understand. They shouldn't be a part of childhood,''
said Dr. Albert Eskenazi, a psychologist in Lakeland. ``To me,
there's a message there that says, `Kid, as soon as you can, be
like that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Butterfly Art Barbies,'' released earlier this year, were
meant to be the start of a trend for the 11 1/2-inch doll. At the
1998 Toy Fair in New York City, Mattel debuted prototypes for a new
Barbie doll and friends that featured tattoos, triple-pierced ears
and nose studs.
</P>
<P>
   The new line, titled ``Generation Girl Barbie'' and released
this spring, was eventually toned down to include a tiny red and
blue tattoo on Barbie's ankle and a nose stud on her British buddy,
Chelsie.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the parental criticism, however, Mattel has
performed plastic surgery on the dolls to remove the tattoos and
piercings, Kendall said. No future ``Tattoo Barbies'' are planned,
Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel initially wanted to include tattoos and temporary tattoos
in its Barbie line ``because kids love them,'' Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just meant to be fun and something little girls like,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   And tattoos as toys are nothing new. Cracker Jack boxes have
included temporary tattoos as prizes for years. Hasbro debuted
``Action Man Tiger Stripe,'' a GI Joe doll with a large tiger
tattoo covering his chest, in 1995. The problem isn't with the toys
themselves, but with the culture that promotes them, Eskenazi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any particular type of game or toy that
in and of itself influences a child,'' he said. ``If you get a
perfectly healthy child in a perfectly healthy environment, there's
probably not much influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course not everyone sees tattooed Barbies as a bad thing.
Just as a traditional Barbie might send a message of unearthly
proportional perfection and conformity, a Barbie with a tattoo lets
kids know it's OK to be different, said Lee Brook, a tattoo artist
at Lou's National Tattoos in Lakeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's about time Barbie got a little risky,'' he said.
``She was too pretty. They needed to bring her down to earth a
little.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the tattooed dolls also acknowledge that different
families have different ideas of what is ``normal,'' Brook said.

HOMEMADE SITES FOR STANLEY CUP FINALISTS WORTH BOOKMARKING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few fans of the NHL follow their heroes on the Internet with
more passion than Stars fans.
</P>
<P>
   As the Stars and Buffalo Sabres prepare to face off Tuesday in
the first game of the Stanley Cup Finals, now is as good a time as
any to check out the many homemade sites devoted to the finalists.
</P>
<P>
   Of the scores of sites, here are a few of the memorable by
category:
</P>
<P>
   Unofficial official-like sites: Paul Szeglowski of West Seneca,
N.Y., has a labor of love going with his Go Sabres! site
(puckplace.com/sabres). Go Sabres! has updated content and
exclusive audio highlights of every Sabres goal _ with a few fights
thrown in _ this season.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew's Dallas Stars Page
(rampages.onramp.net/(tilde)markstep/stars.htm), a father-son
creation of Mark and Andrew Stepneski of Plano, Texas, is a family
effort. The Stepneskis make it a quality-time project _ attending
home games then hurrying home to post results.
</P>
<P>
   Players pages: Diane Lau of Hales Corners, Wis., posts a
six-chapter narrative highlighting Stars center Guy Carbonneau's
career at her site
(www.livingbeyondreality.com/GuyCarbonneau.html). Mary Bowman of
Dallas collects original photos of Stars winger Sergei Zubov at her
site (www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Loge/8256).
</P>
<P>
   Matt Morrissey of Lindsay, Ontario, has more than 800 images of
Stars goalie Ed Belfour posted at his site
(www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Arena/6004/BELFOUR.html). Another
Belfour fan, 15-year-old Fran Bildner of Philadelphia, tracks the
goalie closely at her site
(www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Arena/9349).
</P>
<P>
   College student Lisa Shannon of Sherman, Texas, scours the Web
for news on Stars winger Jere Lehtinen at her tribute page
(www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Midfield/8355/jere2.html). Shelly
Beeman of Irving, Texas, liked Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor's
intensity and created The Unofficial Darryl Sydor Page
(www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Sideline/5503).
</P>
<P>
   Janelle Wolfson of Rowlett, Texas, was so upset to see Stars
center Joe Nieuwendyk booed in his return game against the Calgary
Flames that she launched a Nieuwendyk site
(www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Field/8041). Another quality
Nieuwendyk page is his unofficial site
(www.geocities.com/MotorCity/Track/5888) created by a fan who has
tracked Nieuwendyk's career.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' Mike Modano has two known fan sites. The Mighty
Magical Mo Show, (www.angelfire.com/mo/modanogrrrl) includes a
poetry corner, and the Mike Modano page
(www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Field/1579) has lots of images and
multimedia links.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres have one known player site, but it is distinctive.
Access the site of Buffalo goalie Dominik Hasek
(www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Arena/6265) and little images of the
Vezina and Hart trophies chase your cursor's movements. It's quite
annoying. It's also a good place to buy Hasek's hot sauce and
stuffed bears, which benefit charity.
</P>
<P>
   Hardcore Stars fans: Lydia Sappington of Midlothian, Texas,
created the Unofficial Jason Botterill Webpage
(people.delphi.com/jasbotterill) to track a Stars player who is
assigned to the Michigan K-Wings, the Stars' top minor-league
affiliate. Jeannie Millender of Plano bought a domain name and
posts her photos of practices and special events at her site,
(www.thedallasstars.com).
</P>
<P>
   Best Stars page by a Swede: Johan Rojestal of Sweden has one
page of his site (home1.2.sbbs.se/johan.rojestal) in English, but
Stars fans should get the point at the Swedish parts _ besides,
there are only so many ways to say Michigan K-Wings in Swedish.
</P>
<P>
   Best Stars page by a Canadian: Pierre Stymiest of Moncton, New
Brunswick, a fan of the team for 15 years, tracks his heroes at
Pierre's Dallas Stars Page
(www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Field/3851).
</P>
<P>
   Best Minnesota North Stars site: Ken Avery and Paul Keller of
St. Paul, Minn., have old North Stars fans in mind with their
Minnesota North Star Memories site
(pages.prodigy.net/a79krgm/northstars). The site is a scrapbook for
North Stars fans and a resource for fans wanting to learn about the
franchise's 26-year history before it arrived in Texas. It includes
an account of the team's first season, a commentary of the team's
two Stanley Cup Finals appearances and audio of play-by-play
announcer Al Shaver's last call for the North Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Best Stars forum: Mark Crawford of Mesquite, Texas, moderates
and shoots down or edits flames at his Craw4D's Dallas Stars Forum
(www0.delphi.com/dallasstars).
</P>
<P>
   Worst site for a Detroit Red Wings fan: Steve Dallas' Unofficial
Dallas Stars NHL Page (members.delphi.com/stvdallas99) will keep
its Predictions for '99 section posted because they were submitted
by Red Wings fans, ``and well, needless to say, their forecasts are
a little off,'' said site creator Kevin Stagg of Garland, Texas.

PRESIDENTS WHO DIDN'T CARRY THE POPULAR VOTE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Which presidents, if any, were elected by the Electoral
College but failed to carry the plurality of the popular vote?
</P>
<P>
   _J.R.B., Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Three presidents were elected despite trailing another
candidate in the popular vote: John Quincy Adams in 1824,
Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876 and Benjamin Harrison in 1888.
</P>
<P>
   Adams received 50,000 fewer votes than Andrew Jackson in an
election in which each of four candidates won the popular vote of
one state. Because no candidate received a majority of electoral
votes, the House of Representatives chose the president.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes received 4,033,950 votes, 250,000 fewer than Samuel
Tilden, and Harrison received 5,444,337 votes, trailing Grover
Cleveland by 95,000.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents are elected by the Electoral College, not the popular
vote. A narrow win in a large state usually gives a candidate all
of its electors, and this can overcome larger losses in several
smaller states with fewer electors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mathematicians calculate that there is a one-in-two chance
that a very close election (like 1960) will elect a president that
has lost in the popular vote,'' Michael Young of the Center for
Survey Research wrote last year in USA Today Magazine. ``It is a
ticking time bomb that sooner or later will go off.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm a longtime listener of Paul Harvey. Where can I write to
him?
</P>
<P>
   _J.T.L., Azle, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to him in care of Paul Harvey News, 333 N. Michigan
Ave., Chicago 60601.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey, who has an audience of 19 million listeners on 1,600
radio stations, has been broadcasting his daily news program for
ABC Radio Networks since 1951.
</P>
<P>
   The 80-year-old broadcaster has been working in radio since
1933, when KVOO of Tulsa hired him at age 14.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happened to ``Legacy''?
</P>
<P>
   _C.G., Stephenville, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: UPN canceled the series in May along with ``America's
Greatest Pets,'' ``Clueless,'' ``DiResta'' and ``Love Boat: The
Next Wave.''
</P>
<P>
   A ``Keep `Legacy''' fan effort is encouraging fans to tell
producers they will follow the show to another network. The
suggested address for these letters is Peter Sussman, Alliance
Atlantis Communications, 808 Wilshire Blvd., Third Floor, Santa
Monica, CA 90401.

A CLASSICAL CAREER WASN'T IN THE CARDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ It was supposed to be a summer job: Move to
Tahoe, deal cards and take some time off before pursuing a Ph.D. in
piano.
</P>
<P>
   Then Allan Fuller's life took an unexpected turn. He loved the
casino: the intrigue, the characters, the structure and security of
working for a big company.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades have passed since Fuller graduated from Central
Washington University with a master's degree in piano performance
and went to work for Harrah's, first in Lake Tahoe, then in Reno.
</P>
<P>
   He's a manager now, director of table games, to be exact. But
his acceptance to the Cliburn Competition for Outstanding Amateurs
proves that he's kept his fingers limber.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the dichotomy is striking. Classical pianist. Casino
manager. It makes you wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Fuller's professor at CWU says he was the most talented, focused
student she has seen at the school in 26 years of teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (Allan) announced that he and his wife were going to be
card dealers in Tahoe, I nearly fainted,'' says Professor Bonalyn
Bricker-Smith. ``I thought, `What is he doing? He should be getting
a doctorate and teaching at the college level.'''
</P>
<P>
   Once at Harrah's, Fuller learned to deal cards correctly so he
wouldn't ruin his hands. That obstacle aside, he's managed to
balance both a fulfilling career and a consuming passion for music.
</P>
<P>
   He started playing piano at 6. His mother, a full-time piano
teacher, had bought a recording of Bach's Two-Part Inventions.
Allan seemed drawn to it, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put it on every chance he got,'' Georgette Fuller recalls.
Out of the blue, Allan started picking out the right-hand part of
Invention No. 8, sounding it out like the music was written down in
his head.
</P>
<P>
   Georgette Fuller quickly added her son to her roster of
students, which included her older child, Richard. Eight years
Allan's senior, Richard Fuller is a successful fortepianist in
Vienna and is considered a Mozart expert.
</P>
<P>
   When the boys were young, the Fuller home, near Wenatchee,
Wash., was filled with music: ``It was a wonderful environment to
grow up in,'' Fuller notes.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Fuller says his interest in classical piano waned
during his teen-age years. He wanted to play rock 'n' roll. His
teacher during those formative years, Stella Knoebel, was very
traditional. She had studied with Russian pianist Josef Lhevinne,
whose wife, Rosina, taught Van Cliburn at the Juilliard School of
Music.
</P>
<P>
   Then at 18, something clicked. To his mother's surprise,
pursuing classical piano became his goal. He entered Whitworth
College in Spokane, Wash., and received a full scholarship to the
University of Oregon for a master's degree.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon didn't feel right, though, so Fuller returned to
Washington to finish his master's at CWU.
</P>
<P>
   He has come a long way from the early days when his mom says she
could hardly stand to listen. The piano ``was this great big wild
animal that he was going to tame,'' Georgette says, ``and he had a
terrible touch.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past 20 years, Fuller has continued to study and perform
recitals. He taught for a year at the University of Nevada-Reno, in
between training new blackjack dealers. He practices two to three
hours a day, even when there isn't a competition looming.
</P>
<P>
   In his younger years, Fuller, 43, favored the forceful,
virtuosic compositions of Beethoven and Liszt. There came a point,
though, where he started to feel like a musical assembly line:
learn a program, play it in recital, put it away, start all over
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to initiate my own self-improvement program and not
to play in public for a while,'' he explains. He listened to and
read every piece of music he could get his hands on. He studied the
repertoire and zeroed in on his musical goals. Now he thrills at
the challenge of putting together a recital that creates ``a
flow,'' that meets the audience's needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really intrigued by the notion of programming and how
pieces fit together,'' he says. ``It's just constantly fascinating
to me how much beautiful music there is.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, Fuller returned to his hometown to perform a recital, an
event that made him more nervous than even the Fort Worth
competition does. After all, people he knew were in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Allan ``has realized, as he's gone farther into his career, that
(piano) is not only a joy, but a release,'' says Georgette. ``It
has a steadying impact on his life.''

SAFETY PANEL RECOMMENDS CAMERAS IN TAXIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Taxis here may soon be equipped with small
infrared digital cameras that photograph drivers and their
passengers under a safety plan to be considered by the San
Francisco Taxicab Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``A security camera in a tamper-proof box gives a measure of
protection to both driver and passenger,'' said Jane Bolig, a
member of the task force advising the Taxicab Commission on safety.
``I think that just the presence of the cameras will discourage
violent crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The police also see some benefits. ``It could discourage people
from doing things illegal or harmful if they knew there was a
camera there,'' said Dewayne Tully, a spokesman for the Police
Department, which neither endorsed nor opposed the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Several drivers who were told of the idea on Monday said they
worried about a loss of privacy, for themselves and their
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras are one of many ideas being considered to make
drivers and passengers feel safer about riding a cab in San
Francisco. Both taxi drivers and many prospective passengers have
been unnerved by recent high-profile homicides in which cabbies
have either been victims or, in one case last month, a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Other safety suggestions include an emergency 911 switch in each
cab that can be activated by either the driver or the passenger,
and increased safety training and background screening for drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department is studying how many times cab drivers are
either victims or suspects in crimes. The police said the
preliminary data back up the widespread belief in the industry that
driving a taxi is a dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a lot more likely to be victims,'' said Sgt. Vincent
Simpson, who is overseeing the study. ``It's one of the most
dangerous jobs that you can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, taxi drivers are more likely to become victims of
workplace homicides than other workers, ranking well ahead of
retail store clerks and police officers, according to studies by
the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.
</P>
<P>
   Three San Francisco taxi drivers have been killed on duty in the
past 18 months. None of the cases has been solved. The police
believe robbery was the motive in each case.
</P>
<P>
   But when a taxi driver allegedly raped and killed a 24-year-old
woman after picking her up outside a trendy Financial District
champagne bar on May 14, the focus shifted to include passenger
safety as well.
</P>
<P>
   Bolig, a taxi driver for the past 25 years who also sits on the
seven-member Taxicab Commission, said that digital cameras the size
of cigarette packs may be the most promising options. She said
that, if bought in bulk, cameras would cost only about $500 each
and could easily be installed in the cabs and mounted on the
rear-view mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be the fastest thing and probably the most cost
effective too,'' she said.

NEW HORSE FOUNTAIN IN DOWNTOWN FORT WORTH CALLS TO MIND TALES OF
THE OLD ONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Fort Worth is in the middle of a birthday
party.
</P>
<P>
   There have been sesquicentennial fireworks and music _ ranging
from Motown to cattle calls. Remembering Fort Worth's past has been
the focus; rediscovering the people and places that made the city a
success has been the goal.
</P>
<P>
   That goal has been accomplished mostly in the smaller events.
Events like the dedication of a new flagpole or the unveiling of
the new horse fountain at the Tarrant County Courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Under the spreading mesquite tree at the corner of Commerce and
Weatherford streets, hundreds of visitors endured a stinging
noonday sun to see a new fountain emerge where the old one once
stood. The city doesn't need a new fountain to water its horses. It
just wanted one. There were some good tales told about the old
fountain, and Fort Worth loves old tales.
</P>
<P>
   The original fountain was put there in 1892 by The Woman's
Humane Association. It was one of six such fountains spread around
town. The only other places where horses could be watered at the
time were the livery stables, and they charged for their water. A
lot of horses went without refreshment before the fountains were
installed.
</P>
<P>
   The fountain was a noble cause, but not so noble that a few
drunken cowboys didn't try to climb up on it and ride the horse on
top. There are no records as to how many cowboys came crashing down
in the wet troughs below, but we do know that one finally managed
to break the horse's tail off and it had to be re-attached.
</P>
<P>
   No telling what the cowboy broke.
</P>
<P>
   Drunken cowboys were a part of Fort Worth history. So were bad
drivers, and one crashed into the base of the fountain in the
1940s, and the whole thing had to be dismantled.
</P>
<P>
   That could have been the end of the fountain. Certainly by the
1940s there weren't many horses wandering around downtown. But
people in Fort Worth embrace their past, and because the watering
hole was a popular place in the city's history, they wanted it
back.
</P>
<P>
   Kids sent their pennies, fees were levied and a benefactor _
Melissa Gordon _ gave thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Marguerite Coburn made sure the horse that endured so many
light-headed cowboys was saved.
</P>
<P>
   The horse, rumors said, had been sighted at a Colleyville
racetrack, then a funeral home, then a downtown western wear store.
The rumors weren't far off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around the late 1950s or early '60s, Mother went into Otha
Tiner's harness shop and Otha asked her if she wanted to see a
little pony,'' Jerrell Coburn remembered. ``It was the pony from
the original fountain. Mr. Lucas, from Lucas Funeral Home, had
taken it and put it on his barn. It was blown down in a storm.''
</P>
<P>
   The pony was in pieces, but Coburn and Tiner put it back
together and took it to a foundry, where a cast was made and four
more ponies were manufactured.
</P>
<P>
   The Coburns gave one to Tarrant County so that one day it could
rest atop the fountain again.
</P>
<P>
   ``About every 10 years, somebody would say they discovered the
little horse,'' Coburn said. At the dedication of the new fountain,
several people talked about rediscovering the little horse in the
dark basement of the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always around,'' Coburn said. ``It never was
undiscovered.''

 &HT;    HIGH QUALITY DAY CARE HELPS STUDENTS FOR YEARS, STUDY FINDS
 &HT;    540&AMP;add. With CHILD-CARE-TIPS. Moving in (w) Washington and (l)
lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A child's benefits from care at a high-quality
pre-school center last at least three to four years, according to a
federally funded study released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The findings added weight to reformers' arguments for higher
government spending on day care, more training for providers and
stricter monitoring of the quality of day care.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many previous reports on day care, the study covered
children from many backgrounds, ranging from very rich to very
poor.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from four major universities evaluated a random
sample of classrooms in 401 private and public day care centers in
four states in 1993 and 1994. The study compared how children from
top-rated centers compared with those from lowest-rated centers in
1997, at the end of second grade.
</P>
<P>
   Those who had attended the best-rated centers were doing
measurably better than those from the worst-rated centers in math,
understanding spoken language, paying attention and getting along
with other children. But there was no significant difference in
reading skills, which seemed to depend more on the quality of their
education in first and second grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most areas of development that we examined, there was
evidence of a modest continued influence of child care quality on
children's abilities and skills through second grade,'' concluded
the researchers from the University of North Carolina, the
University of Colorado, Yale University and the University of
California Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we can say about 60 percent of children (from) very
high-quality child care were achieving well as second graders and
only 40 percent of children (from) low-quality centers were
achieving well,'' said UCLA Professor Carrollee (cq) Howes, one of
the principal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The boost from high quality care was even stronger among those
who needed early help the most _ boys and girls whose mothers had
little or no education.
</P>
<P>
   ``While heightened public awareness (from such studies) is a
plus, our progress has been far too limited,'' said Education
Secretary Richard Reilly. ``The number of quality child care
facilities that meet high standards and offer employees a livable
wage remains woefully inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   He called for more federal funding for day care and asked states
to imitate ``the progressive efforts'' in Georgia and North
Carolina, which he said ``capitalize on some of the latest
information available'' on how to educate children in their
earliest years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Former Georgia Gov. Zell(cq) Miller launched an effort that
will make his state the first in the nation to offer universal
pre-K classes for 4-year-olds,'' Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Jim Hunt's Smart Start initiative in North Carolina
covers a range of early childhood services, but focuses primarily
on the quality of child care, making it more affordable and making
it more available,'' Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was particularly impressed by North Carolina's plans
to start a rating system this summer. To help parents find high
quality centers, state licenses for child care centers will include
one to five stars, with five stars awarded to centers with the
highest quality ratings.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Finding quality child care is one of the most difficult and
emotional tasks facing working parents across America,'' he said.
Too often, working parents, whether long employed or recently off
the welfare rolls, ``cannot find child care that is both affordable
and high quality,'' Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   Howes offered three rules of thumb for parents: The best centers
almost always have no more than 10 children per adult, teachers
with college degrees and teachers with salaries near to those for
beginning teachers in nearby public schools.
</P>
<P>
   About 6.8 million pre-schoolers, including three-quarters of
those aged three to five, are receiving some sort of day care,
according to Richard Clifford, a co-director of the study from the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

 &HT;    KOSOVAR REBELS PLEDGE NOT TO SHOOT AS YUGOSLAV FORCES WITHDRAW
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-STRIKES-0609.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ Rebels fighting for the independence of Kosovo
pledged Tuesday to hold their fire on Serb-led Yugoslav forces if
they begin to withdraw as part of a NATO-approved peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kosovo Liberation Army will neither raise obstacles nor
attack Serb military units if and when they withdraw,'' Bajram
Kosumi, the minister of information for the Provisional Government
of Kosovo, said at a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA also said it would lay down its weapons once it judges
that the threat posed by the Yugoslav military and Serb police is
gone. ``The KLA will be disarmed when there is no longer the need
to keep the guns,'' Kosumi said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO leaders have been seeking assurances from the rebel army,
which claims to have more than 15,000 soldiers inside Kosovo
province, that it will cease its campaign once a peace deal is
concluded. The Provisional Government of Kosovo is headed by Hashim
Thaci, the leader of the KLA's political wing.
</P>
<P>
   Thaci and Ibrahim Rugova, Thaci's rival for the Kosovan
leadership, and Rexhep Qosja, an influential Kosovar Albanian
nationalist, also met with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright Tuesday as she sought assurances that they would not try
to disrupt a swift Yugoslav military withdrawal. Serb officials in
Belgrade stressed there could be no ``security vacuum'' opening up
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pledges of cooperation, the Americans are keen to
promote consensus among the various Albanian factions, which are
bitterly divided. A vicious power struggle, mainly between Rugova
and Thaci, is expected to erupt in the weeks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   While the separatist leaders said they would accept NATO's
leadership, they expressed deep reservations about the use of
Russian troops as peacekeepers. ``Russian diplomacy has not shown
itself to be unbiased,'' Kosumi said. ``It's also a well-known fact
that many Russian officials have joined the Serb army.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, KLA units have been engaged in intense fighting
against Serb forces near the Yugoslavia border with Albania.
Casualties on both sides have been said to be heavy, but neither
has been willing to provide casualty figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great number of KLA soldiers killed,'' Kosumi said.
``But the number of Serbs killed is many times more.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Serb artillery has pounded villages in northern
Albania, forcing thousands of residents to flee their homes. A
World Food Program official here said the agency was feeding 8,000
Albanian villagers and Kosovar refugees displaced by the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   NATO warplanes have bombed Serb positions destroying several
pieces of artillery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to the acceptance of the peace plan by the
(Serb-dominated Yugoslav) Parliament, contrary to the first signals
of the war ending in Kosovo, the Belgrade regime has intensified
its military activities on all fronts inside Kosovo,'' Kosumi said.
</P>
<P>
   He also accused Serb forces of using chemical weapons in two
recent attacks within Kosovo, a province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's
dominant republic.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA said chemical weapons were used on June 4, 5 and 6 in
the village of Dushka and in the Berisha mountains by Yugoslav
forces. If so, it would be a violation of international law.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA has sent investigators to gather more information about
the incidents. An army spokesman said it had encountered victims
with medical symptoms of the chemicals as well as witnesses who had
seen the shells explode and emit clouds of vapor.
</P>
<P>
   International groups such as Amnesty International have reported
that the Yugoslav military has stockpiled chemical weapons
containing sarim, sulfur mustard and the agent, BZ.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The KLA also said they believe the Serbs may be stalling the
peace talks to buy time to hide evidence of atrocities by
transporting the bodies of slain ethnic Albanians to be buried
elsewhere or cremated. The KLA, which said it has videotapes and
photographs to support its
</P>
<P>
   allegations, also accused Serbs of using bulldozers to dig up
mass graves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen trucks pulling trailers full of bodies away to be
individually buried or cremated,'' said Isa Blumi, the director of
the Kosova Press agency, which is affiliated with the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   There was no way to independently confirm these allegations.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and the Pentagon have received such reports but have not
verified them, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA said it has turned over its evidence to the
international war crimes tribunal at the Hague.

   COLLEYVILLE, Texas _ This is not your ordinary barnyard yarn.
</P>
<P>
   This is the ram-bunctious tale of the Smullin family, postmodern
shepherds who prefer city streets to hilly green pastures and
running shoes to the traditional 6-foot wood staff.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every morning for three years, they have enjoyed a jog
through their upscale neighborhood _ followed by sheep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's hysterical,'' neighbor Teresa McGaha said.
``We've gotten used to it. But it's funny when we have company
over. They look out the window and say, `Hey, there are sheep out
there!'''
</P>
<P>
   This woolly display began three years ago when the Smullins'
daughter, Christine, brought home rams _ Elmo and Grover _ as part
of a project at school. Students at Grapevine High School would
take home their animals, raise them and feed them, then sell them
at the end of the school year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the students let their sheep exercise in pastures, on
a treadmill or lamb racetracks,'' said Christine Smullin, 18. ``We
took ours jogging. And they are a lot more energetic than my dog.''
</P>
<P>
   As the sheep followed the family through the neighborhood, the
school projects became family pets. It made it difficult to give
them up at the end of the year when they, like most other rams,
were sold for slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The Smullins couldn't bear the thought of their family pets
ending up as sliced mutton served next to piles of peas, carrots
and mint jelly, so last year they started taking home female sheep.
</P>
<P>
   ``To sell them _ that was pretty tough,'' Christine Smullin
said. ``When you raise an animal for a year, you get attached.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we will breed sheep and sell them to the school.''
</P>
<P>
   The family now has two ewes, 2-year-old Peppermint and
1-year-old Snuffleupagus, who have been jogging since they were
tiny lambs. The sheep, who are kept in the back yard, learned the
proper exercise etiquette early and graduated from the leash.
</P>
<P>
   But they do sometimes lag behind the Smullins, sprint ahead,
stop to smell the shrubbery or stick their heads in the open car
windows of amazed passers-by.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do they have muzzles on? Do they bite?'' the passers-by
sometime ask while petting the tops of the woolly heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never bite,'' the Smullins say. ``We have the muzzle so
they don't eat everyone's grass.''
</P>
<P>
   The cars pull away, and Peppermint and Snuffleupagus happily
continue their workout over curbless streets and past widely spaced
houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we are the silliest sight,'' said Lyn Smullin,
Christine's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Because Christine Smullin is heading to Baylor University this
fall with dreams of becoming an orthopedic surgeon, such sightings
might soon end. The family is planning to breed the sheep and sell
them to the school.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes as planned, the bleat of newborn lambs should sound
in this Colleyville neighborhood in less than a year. When the
lambs are weaned, they, Peppermint and Snuffleupagus may disappear
forever from the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see,'' Lyn Smullin said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the newly shorn Peppermint and Snuffleupagus will be
out jogging beneath the early morning sun every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we skip one day, the next morning they are frolicking and
hopping and jumping,'' Christine Smullin said. ``They miss it, and
they let you know it.''

IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG, PARSIMONIOUS SUMMER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's just cancel this season. Summer vacation is not working
out. My children have been out of school for only two weeks and I
think that is about long enough.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that I don't enjoy their company, au contraire, every
moment is special. It's just that I feel selfish having them all to
myself for hours and hours every day. Other people deserve to share
in the joy, the camaraderie, the electric bill.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I can't afford summer. My children think we're supposed
to do something exciting and entertaining every single day. They
become bored right after breakfast. We've got 2,000 channels of
television, but they can't find a single program worth watching or
a book that will hold their interest. I barely get a cup of coffee
down before the whining starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, can we turn the air conditioner on? It's hot in here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But Mom, look at all the sweat on my face, I'm burning up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not sweat, it's dew. You woke up too early. Just sit
still and breathe slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   In disbelief, my son walks over to the thermostat and exclaims,
``This thing is on 78 degrees! Can I turn it down some? It's cooler
outside than it is in here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do, we'll have to unplug the refrigerator. Take your
choice. It doesn't matter to me. You and your brother have eaten up
all the food anyway. Which reminds me, please stop leaving empty
boxes in the pantry and also, whenever there is only one potato
chip left, feel free to dispose of the bag.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, you and Dad are so cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, cheap people don't want to spend their money. We are
simply broke. We want to spend money but we don't have any because
we spent it all on Star Wars, Putt Putt, football camp, seven trips
to the grocery store, new swimming trunks, goggles and T-shirts.''
</P>
<P>
   He remains unfazed by our plight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, my old T-shirts had holes in the armpits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And? Just keep your arms down. Forget basketball; play
hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, what about our allowance? We haven't gotten it for two
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 12 pennies in a box under my bed. I was saving them
for a special occasion but you can split them with your brother.
I'll just cut my hair myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Laughing, he says, ``Gee, you're worse than Ebenezer Scrooge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Son, Ebenezer had money. I'm just broke. Now, go put your
goggles on, it will keep the dew out of your eyes.''

A HAIRDRESSER'S BRUSH WITH MUSICAL FAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Juilliard's loss was hairstyling's gain.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Valdez, an outstanding senior-level piano student at the
University of Northern Colorado, knew exactly what he wanted to do
when he was turned down for graduate-level admission to the
prestigious Juilliard School in New York. Instead of selecting a
different conservatory, or trying Juilliard again, Valdez dropped
out of college and went to beauty school.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was 13 years ago,'' says Valdez, a hairdresser. ``I
haven't looked back.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdez, who turned 35 last week, loved the piano from an early
age while growing up in Boone, Colo. When he was 7, he begged his
older sister, who was already studying at college level, for
lessons. He immediately became one of those kids who takes it
seriously and is taken seriously by teachers and other adults. Like
any kid who plays the piano well in a small town, he played solo
recitals and frequently accompanied choirs and singers. After
graduating from high school, he entered the University of Northern
Colorado as a piano major.
</P>
<P>
   He also taught piano, and that was the turning point in his
career. A moment of truth came about midway through his college
years, while he was getting his hair cut at a salon owned by the
father of two of his young students. There, he noticed the
sociability and constant person-to-person contact of the
hair-styling profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pianist spends at least four hours a day alone with a
piano,'' he says. ``I wanted to be around people.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is what Valdez does now, usually working four 11-hour days
weekly at a locally owned chain of salons in the Denver suburbs.
It's on the other three days of the week that he puts in the heavy
practice, at home, at his 7-foot Steinway grand piano. He says his
practice time ranges from one to four hours daily, depending on his
anxiety level.
</P>
<P>
   He'll make his bid for recognition in round one in Fort Worth
with Chopin's Ballade in G minor, and hopes to advance through
round two with music of Mendelssohn, Prokofiev and J.S. Bach. Round
three allows for repetition from the earlier two rounds, and
Valdez's strategy, if he makes the finals, is to simply combine and
repeat the well-polished repertoire from the previous two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   After hair school, Valdez says he continued to play the piano,
though without the demands of a teacher, not quite as well. To meet
his continued desire for competition, he took up tennis, playing in
adult-league matchups.
</P>
<P>
   The chance to play piano in the amateur competition in Fort
Worth has encouraged Valdez to renew his practice habits, but not
obsessively. Indeed, in his determination to keep the rest of his
life going smoothly, he has decreased his practice time, making
sure to take time for friends and tennis. He also continues to keep
up his schedule as a volunteer, accompanying area school choirs and
performing at charity events.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be balance in life,'' Valdez says.

 &HT;    HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP CALLS FOR BAN ON 'STUN BELTS'
 &HT;    By RAVEN HILL
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Amnesty International called Tuesday for a ban on
high-voltage ``stun belts'' in the criminal justice system, saying
their use on prisoners recalls the conduct exposed in the New York
police brutality trial.
</P>
<P>
   The battery-powered belts deliver 50,000 volts of electricity
for eight seconds at the touch of a remote-control button. They
cause temporary muscle paralysis, loss of control of bodily
functions and intense pain.
</P>
<P>
   More than 130 U.S. jurisdictions, have used the belt since its
introduction in the past few years, said William F. Schulz,
executive director of Amnesty International. This includes state
prisons in Florida, Georgia and Colorado, and some local systems in
Ohio and Texas, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   Calling for a ban on the belt and suspension of other stun
technology pending a strict medical review, Schulz drew parallels
between the Abner Louima police brutality case in New York and
situations in which stun belts have been used.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zapping a prisoner is no less cruel, inhuman or degrading than
sodomizing a suspect with a stick in a police station,'' he said.
``Even if it is state-of-the-art, it is torture nonetheless.''
</P>
<P>
   While beatings with nightsticks and other weapons can leave
noticeable marks, stun belt abuse amounts to ``torture without a
trace,'' Schulz said.
</P>
<P>
   Groups representing prisons and corrections officers had no
immediate response to the call for a ban.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International plans to ask Congress for a federal review
of the devices and has filed briefs in lawsuits been filed by
inmates against corrections systems where stun belts were used, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz commended the U.S. Bureau of Prisons' policy prohibiting
the use of stun belts on pregnant women and inmates suffering from
epilepsy or heart conditions, but said a ban is still warranted.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International has been joined by former heavyweight
boxing champion Muhammad Ali in an effort to raise public awareness
of the use and potential dangers of stun belts. His youngest
daughter, Laila Ali, spoke on his behalf on Wednesday and said she
supports the international campaign as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often the message gets across when someone we are familiar
with speaks out,'' said Laila Ali, who is training to be a boxer.
``That is sad, but whatever way we can get this message across is
good.''

THE LITTLE PIANIST THAT COULD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ David Hibbard was 5 years old when he heard
Beethoven's ``Moonlight'' Sonata on the radio. He immediately loved
it, as have people of many generations before him.
</P>
<P>
   He begged his parents for piano lessons. By age 7, he was
studying with a teacher in his hometown of Peoria, Ill. Right away
he informed her that he wanted to play the ``Moonlight'' Sonata.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher found a simplified version for him fairly quickly.
He managed to get a copy of the more difficult original version on
his own, however, and taught it to himself on the sly _ struggling
with some of the stretches.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I learned the `Moonlight' Sonata, I quit,'' Hibbard, now
52, said recently, sitting in the handsomely restored bungalow just
southeast of the Texas Christian University campus where he and his
wife, Anna, live.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't quit piano forever, though, and he is among the
competitors in the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition for
Outstanding Amateurs. It begins this week in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Hibbard's love of piano blossomed again when he was a teen-ager
in Canton, Ill., and he earned first prize with flourish-laden
Rachmaninoff in a statewide music contest for high-schoolers. After
graduating, he entered the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign as a piano major, and spent two semesters there
before the need to earn money sent him to work for a railroad.
</P>
<P>
   Hibbard had railroad work in his blood as much as piano music:
His Irish-born mother came from generations of railroad workers.
When he returned to college 10 years later at the University of
Illinois at Chicago, he majored in Slavic languages and Eastern
European history.
</P>
<P>
   But he never gave up his love of piano. While working in Kansas
City in 1989-92, he took lessons from a Russian immigrant,
Svyatoslav Levin, continuing until 1993 when he was assigned to
Fort Worth. He is manager of locomotive utilization for Burlington
Northern and Santa Fe Railway, dealing with reciprocal use among
different railroad companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard about the amateur competition on Channel 8,'' he says.
``I pulled up the Cliburn Web site, and, more or less on a lark,
threw my name in the hat. You could have knocked me over with a
feather when I was accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   He generally puts in 10- to 12-hour days at his job at the
railway. But since being accepted to the competition, he has made
time for regular practice on the 1925 Steinway that dominates his
house. His program of Chopin and Scriabin reflects his interest in
Slavic history and culture.

DR. BOB'S INTERNET SERVICES ARE REALLY CLICKING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Someday soon, you will be able to dial
``star'' DR (''star'' 37) on your push-button phone, ask your
medical questions, and get within hours personalized answers from a
doctor who specializes in your medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone, that most basic of communication tools, is being
integrated with computer software, radio and television to get
consumers the medical information they want when they want it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information exchange is going to be ``the issue'' in medicine
for at least the next 20 years,'' says Dr. Bob Lanier,
physician-broadcaster and president-elect of the Tarrant County
Medical Society, who is already aggressively using the Internet to
provide information for a growing number of people with health-care
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   His Web site, www.askdrbob.com, averages 1,000 hits a day, and
he gets 300 to 400 e-mail questions daily.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a new software package Lanier has created, he is able
to answer a lot of questions very quickly, but he is enlisting the
help of a dozen other Tarrant County physicians, specializing in
various areas, to help with the service as it grows worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next phase will involve live chats, and we will have the
ability to push people to the Web sites they need,'' Lanier says.
``Every disease you can think of has dozens of Web sites, and there
are pharmacists available 24 hours a day to answer drug questions.
You can get people psychotherapy over the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the new medical service to coordinate and expand
the computer services already in effect came up when Lanier
realized that his ``Sixty Second Housecall'' television and radio
broadcasts were generating a lot of questions from people in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The medical advice program is carried over 17 stations in Canada
and 47 stations in this country, yet more than 60 percent of his
e-mail was coming from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, why would people in a country where health care is
free use this service so much, and I realized it's because they
have to wait even longer for their medical care than Americans.
People can't get into their doctors' offices,'' Lanier says.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Lanier gets the most questions from young boys and
older women, who seem to use the service in part because they want
to remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers ask questions they don't feel comfortable asking in
person. Women often ask about sexual function, new mothers about
colic, young boys about their genitalia, little girls about
menstrual cycles and child abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Lanier says he often makes referrals, including international
referrals to allergists he knows in Scotland and France. When he
doesn't know a specialist needed in a particular part of the
country, he tells people how to contact their own local medical
societies and how to ask for the information they need.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible now to have this global reach, to help people
all over the world,'' Lanier says. ``We are there to give
information, but not medical therapy. It's not exactly practicing
medicine. We're not writing prescriptions or doing diagnostic
tests. Our action step is education.''

A LOOK AT LBJ'S RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For 30 years, President Lyndon Johnson has been
ignored by Democratic politicians afraid of being tagged as liberal
lackeys for the much-mocked Great Society or the bloody Vietnam war
that brought down his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   His name is seldom mentioned in his own party. Only a few brave
souls defend him against conservatives who have campaigned for
decades against the ambitious federal social programs he created
and the cultural tumult of the 1960s that took place during his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has been particularly craven. Although he
often cites his admiration for President Kennedy, who produced very
little legislation, Clinton never speaks of Johnson, who compiled a
monumental domestic record.
</P>
<P>
   It was to remind us of Johnson's impact on our lives and put a
tidy historical end to the 1990s that scholars and former Johnson
administration officials gathered recently at the LBJ Library in
Austin, Texas, to look back across the generation gap at a period
of almost unimaginable change.
</P>
<P>
   This nation would be a far worse place had Lyndon Johnson not
occupied the White House. He demanded that elderly patients get
government help for heath care through Medicare and Medicaid,
blacks be granted the right to vote and enjoy equal access to
public places, students be given financial aid for education,
consumers be protected from fraud, poverty be assaulted with an
array of education and employment initiatives and discrimination
attacked with affirmative action concepts.
</P>
<P>
   This remarkable domestic revolution was overwhelmed by public
outrage at Johnson for escalating a distant war in which more than
50,000 U.S. soldiers died. As a young student, Clinton himself
dodged the draft to avoid being sent to Vietnam. Resentment of the
war still fuels Clinton's chilly attitude toward Johnson even
though Clinton has fought to perpetuate and expand most of LBJ's
social programs.
</P>
<P>
   But finally that war is fading into history. It was nearly a
quarter century ago that we fled Saigon in defeat. Now diplomatic
and trade ties are being restored and even battle-scarred veterans
are returning there on sentimental visits.
</P>
<P>
   If the war itself can recede, so can public anger at LBJ. He
didn't live long enough to crusade for his own political
rehabilitation, as Richard Nixon did. But time may do the task for
him.
</P>
<P>
   And despite decades of conservative scorn, the Great Society and
the War on Poverty still exist, sometimes under different labels.
</P>
<P>
   At the LBJ Library symposium, Joseph Califano Jr., a former
Johnson White House assistant and Jimmy Carter's Secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare, summed up LBJ's domestic record. And
what a stunning record it is. He shoved through a reluctant
Congress all sorts of radical ideas to help ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   _ For the first time, the federal government subsidized
scholarships, grants and work-study programs to expand education
opportunities for students from families with limited resources.
Since 1965, the federal government has provided more than $120
billion for elementary and secondary schools and billions for
college loans.
</P>
<P>
   Today, nearly 60 percent of full-time undergraduate students
receive federal financial aid. When LBJ took office, only 41
percent of Americans had completed high school; only 8 percent held
college degrees. Last year, more than 81 percent had finished high
school and 24 percent had completed college.
</P>
<P>
   _ Medicare and Medicaid provided millions of elderly Americans
with health insurance for the first time. Since 1965, 79 million
senior citizens have benefited from Medicare. Since 1966, more than
200 million poor Americans have been helped financially by
Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   _ The food stamp program launched in 1967 helps to feed more
than 20 million people in more than 8 million households. The
school breakfast program begun the same year has provided a daily
breakfast to nearly 100 million schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Good nutrition and health affect life expectancy; when LBJ took
office, our average life span was 66.6 years for men and 73 years
for women. In a single generation, by 1997, life expectancy jumped
to 73.6 years for men and 79 years for women, with the most
dramatic increase among the middle class and poor helped by better
nutrition and medical assistance.
</P>
<P>
   _ Johnson's civil rights acts ended the officially segregated
society that belied the American promise of freedom. No longer did
blacks have to drink from separate water fountains and eat in
separate restaurants. No longer were they automatically denied
equal opportunities for jobs and education.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was proudest of the voting rights act, which outlawed
all the sneaky practices that kept blacks from the ballot box. In
1964, there were only 300 black elected officials in the country;
by 1998, there were more than 9,000. In 1965 there were five blacks
in the House; today there are 39.
</P>
<P>
   _ Although conservatives charge that LBJ's Great Society was a
failure, Great Society projects like Head Start, the Job Corps,
Community Health Centers, Foster Grandparents, Upward Bound and
Indian and migrant worker programs helped reduce the number of
Americans living in poverty. When LBJ took office, 22.2 percent of
Americans lived below the poverty level. Today 13.3 percent are
below that level, still too many but a trend in the right
direction.

HOUSE COULD MAKE WAVES FOR PERSONAL WATERCRAFT USERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Calif., Wash., Fla., La., N.J.)  (bl)  
 By CATHERINE HOLLINGSWORTH  
 
 NYT Regional Newspapers  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A beachgoer out for a sunset stroll is startled by
the sudden roar of Jet Skis in the surf. Paddling through a quiet
cove, canoeists encounter a gang of zipping water bikers. As he
casts for an evening catch, a fisherman finds it is prime time for
personal watercraft and all the fish have been chased away.
</P>
<P>
   While some head to the beach and tranquil inland coastlines in
search of solitude and a quiet moment with nature, water beckons
lovers of Jet Skis and similar high-tech recreational vessels as a
source of high-speed thrills.
</P>
<P>
   Now that conflict could be resolved on the high ground of
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with complaints of loud, aggressive personal watercraft
users disturbing serene settings, uprooting wildlife and
endangering other boaters, Congress is prepared to make some waves
of its own.
</P>
<P>
   The House Subcommittee on Fisheries Conservation, Wildlife and
Oceans is considering whether to restrict personal watercraft from
certain areas under the Coastal Zone Management Act. But before it
moves forward, the subcommittee wants to study the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to make sure that the problem is understood
before making a blanket federal law,'' said Jeff Sagnip
Hollendonner, spokesman for subcommittee chairman Rep. Jim Saxton,
R-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Saxton originally proposed broad federal restrictions in
``sensitive areas'' along the East and West coasts and the Great
Lakes. Now he is floating a plan to have states determine whether
such areas exist and to document any safety problems with personal
watercraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the studies are completed, we will have beneficial
information to look at,'' said Sagnip Hollendonner. Proponents of
the measure say the study could be the basis for federal
restrictions in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials hope to block the effort. They argue that
their particular kind of boat has been unfairly singled out for
stricter regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government should be regulating boats across the
board in determining sensitive areas,'' said Larry Lambrose,
executive director of the Personal Watercraft Industry Association
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But David Jenkins, director of conservation and public policy at
the American Canoe Association, said personal watercraft pose
different problems from other boats because of their ability to
navigate shallower water.
</P>
<P>
   ``The little bays, inlets, coves, estuaries, those have been
kind of the realm of paddlers,'' he said. ``With Jet Skis it is
totally different. They like to be anywhere. They just stay in that
area for the whole day.''
</P>
<P>
   Communities in states like Florida, California and Washington
already are moving to restrict personal watercraft in certain areas
and many others are requiring a minimum age and user education.
</P>
<P>
   But conservationists say state laws are not enough. ``They're
always being challenged by the industry,'' said Laurie Martin,
conservation associate at the Izaak Walton League, which supports
federal restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this was passed, it would protect them from those kinds of
challenges. It would be one of the strongest protections they can
enact to address the problems of personal watercraft,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While some say federal regulations could bolster states' efforts
to regulate personal watercraft, others say states could be
hindered by them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an issue that a lot of states are grappling with. But
it's a controversial issue at the state level,'' said Chris
Darnell, policy analyst at the Coastal States Organization. He said
a federal regulation may limit state flexibility in addressing the
personal watercraft issue.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., a member of the House panel exploring
the issue, agreed that a restricted use measure ``might not make a
whole lot of sense'' for some areas.
</P>
<P>
   Makers of personal watercraft such as the Jet Ski and WaveRunner
say current models deal with many concerns about these one to
four-person watercraft.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers point to quieter engines that whir rather than buzz like
a giant mosquito. And they claim that new models have cut harmful
emissions by 70 percent, making them kinder to the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a need to look at the mixed use of the waterways,''
said Lambrose. ``There is room for everybody.''

HIT ME WITH YOUR PET SHARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Attention, class! Today we will test your knowledge of popular
music.
</P>
<P>
   Or, more specifically, test your knowledge of popular music
``lyrics.''
</P>
<P>
   Say what you want about today's music, the words are every bit
as indecipherable as the stuff we listened to 10, 20 or even 30
years ago. There are many ways to mishear song lyrics (stoned being
foremost among them) but the odd thing is that the misunderstood
words often make as much, or more, sense than the originals.
</P>
<P>
   Author David Trevas collected 600 of the most bizarre in his
book, ``The Compendium of Misunderstood Lyrics'' ($10, Viselley
Press). I discovered another good source at Kissthisguy.com _ The
Archive of Misheard Lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   Instructions: Only one lyric in the following songs is correct.
That is unfortunate, because some of the alternatives are a lot
better. Although the correct lyric will be identified at the bottom
of the column, feel free to continue singing the song incorrectly
if you think it makes more sense or you just enjoy annoying people.
It won't hurt my feelings in the slightest.
</P>
<P>
   For example, I now know that the correct lyric in the song ``The
Ballad of Davey Crockett'' is ``killed him a bar when he was only
three.'' That is too bad because I intend to go on singing ``killed
in a bar when he was only three'' because that's how I heard the
lyric when I was 8 and I see no reason to change now. (I figured it
was the Disney way of discouraging toddler alcoholism.)
</P>
<P>
   Scoring: Score five points if you thought the line to Johnny
Rivers' ``Secret Agent Man'' was ``Oswald, he won't live to see
tomorrow'' rather than ``Odds are he won't live to see tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Score four points if you thought the line to the Beatles' ``Lucy
in the Sky With Diamonds'' was ``The girl with colitis goes by''
rather than ``The girl with kaleidoscope eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Score three points if you thought the line in David Bowie's
``Space Oddity'' was ``Ground control to Mao Tse-Tung'' rather than
``Ground control to Major Tom.''
</P>
<P>
   Score zero points if you seriously expected to see the name
``Barry Manilow'' in this column.
</P>
<P>
   1. From Black Crows' song ``Hard to Handle:''
</P>
<P>
   a) Pretty little thing, lemon-lime chicana 'cause mama, I'm sure
hard to henna now, yes I am

EATING WELL: CHEFS JOIN A DRUG COMPANY PROMOTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a new twist in celebrity endorsements, some
well-known New York chefs have teamed up with a pharmaceutical
company to promote a low-fat diet that is part of the company's
campaign for a new anti-obesity drug.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the chefs _ who include Larry Forgione of An American
Place, Jonathan Waxman of Colina and David Burke of Park Avenue
Cafe _ have agreed to promote the diet, but not the drug itself.
They are being paid by the drug company, Hoffmann-La Roche, to help
promote ``The Taste for Healthy Living,'' its diet and educational
program that calls for eating meals in which no more than 30
percent of the calories come from fat. Earlier this year, the
company introduced Xenical, a weight-loss drug that the company
says should be accompanied by such a diet.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in New York in May at which the program was
introduced, Dr. Russell Ellison, the company's vice president for
medical affairs, said: ``We are here to help people make life-style
changes. Xenical is not a magic pill _ it acts by helping you do
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Suga, a spokeswoman for Hoffmann-La Roche, said later
that the use of chefs in the campaign was ``a crucial component
because they are influential.''
</P>
<P>
   But the new alliance is an odd one: the concept of food as
medicine is not one that chefs usually want to present, and until
now, few chefs have been in the vanguard of the battle against fat.
</P>
<P>
   At least two restaurateurs who had agreed to participate have
had second thoughts. Drew Nieporent, whose restaurant Heartbeat is
known for its low-fat, high-flavor food, said he backed out because
``there was a fine line between endorsing the drug and just the
diet.'' Michael Lomonaco of Windows on the World and Wild Blue also
changed his mind. ``I didn't feel comfortable with creating a menu
program that was commercially linked,'' he said. He had offered a
low-fat, low-calorie menu when he was the chef at the ``21'' Club
and, he said, ``it wasn't all that successful.''
</P>
<P>
   But Forgione, who owns several restaurants in addition to An
American Place, said he was not worried about the link between the
diet and the drug. ``Whether there seems to be a cross-reference
with Xenical, those crossovers are fine with me,'' he said. The
company has hired him to form a coalition of chefs, restaurateurs
and health professionals in 19 cities to try to persuade Americans
to adopt the company's suggestions on fat.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to get Americans to reduce their fat intake are not new.
The last big push, in the early 1990s, led many people to replace
the calories from fat with calories from carbohydrates. Today,
Americans are fatter than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The chefs who are being paid for the use of their names said
that even before Hoffmann-La Roche's campaign began, they already
had low-fat dishes on their menus and supported the program's
goals.
</P>
<P>
   The amount a chef receives for his participation depends on what
he is willing to do. An honorarium of $3,000 will be given to those
who put a few dishes on their menus that contain 30 percent fat or
less and label them as such. (Forgione said he was receiving
``considerably more'' than that for his role.) More money will go
to chefs who agree to make public appearances on behalf of the
program. Even more is available if a chef is willing to promote
Xenical, but so far there have been no takers.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Palomino, who is chef and owner of Sonora, a Latin
American restaurant in Manhattan, said he was offered $5,000 extra
if he would ``promote the drug by telling people it doesn't have
any side effects and helps lose a lot of weight.'' But he added,
``No one is going to do that because of the liability.''
</P>
<P>
   Xenical works by blocking the body's absorption of dietary fat.
Patients who have used it have lost modest amounts _ 5 to 10
percent of their body weight _ but some have also suffered side
effects like abdominal pain and fecal incontinence. And as the
insert in the drug's package notes, ``If Xenical is taken with any
one meal very high in fat, the possibility of gastrointestinal
effects increases.'' Ellison said doctors could explain the program
to patients ``in a 10-minute consultation.''
</P>
<P>
   With or without a pill, losing weight _ and keeping it off _
requires more than a 10-minute consultation. It takes a lifetime
commitment to healthy eating, with or without the help of your
favorite chef.

THE POP LIFE: AFTER `GO,' MOBY WENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Calif., Mich., Ill.)  (bl)  
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The year was 1991, and American youth had just
begun to wake up to the electronic dance music-techno that the
British had appropriated from the Chicago and Detroit club scenes.
Though the New York disk jockey Moby was far from the nation's
first techno musician, he was its first great hope.
</P>
<P>
   His single ``Go'' was a club classic, with three samples _ an
orchestral sweep, a voice yelling, ``Go!'' and a snippet of a diva
_ sparring over a fast, piano-enhanced dance beat. His self-titled
album the next year was one of the first high-quality American
techno albums produced in a form that traffics in singles.
</P>
<P>
   To the rock establishment at least, Moby seemed like the man who
would bring mainstream credibility to techno: he could release full
albums, perform energetic concerts and as a skinny shaven-headed
self-declared vegan environmentalist Christian, he had a marketable
personality. In what was then called a ``faceless'' kind of music,
he was to be its first face.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997 techno had its first face _ or haircut, actually _ in
the dyed, spiked fringes of surviving hair on the head of Keith
Flynt, the singer and dancer in Prodigy, from England, which that
year gave techno music its first No. 1 album on Billboard's pop
charts. And where was Moby? The techno crowd had long since
declared him a traitor _ a populist who was too popular _ and Moby
had done his best to alienate that audience, interspersing albums
and concerts with hardcore punk songs.
</P>
<P>
   Caught in the double bind of being too mainstream for the rave
underground and too marginal for the mainstream, his major-label
album from that year, ``Animal Rights'' (Elektra) _ a hodge-podge
of punk, new wave, mock classical, heavy metal, and electronic
dance _ was more or less ignored.
</P>
<P>
   This month, with a new album (``Play'') recorded for a new label
(V2), Moby, now 33, has returned with a surprise, the best album of
his career. It is an electronic dance album, but not techno.
Compositionally it's similar to his earliest work, but it's also
completely new.
</P>
<P>
   The best music on ``Play'' takes a chugging midtempo dance beat,
adds soulful keyboards and tops it with a sample from old blues and
gospel recordings. But even the album's more traditional
verse-chorus-verse pop songs that Moby sings himself, in particular
``South Side,'' are his most accessible and fully realized.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of sampled forms of music, from electronica to hip-hop,
has given rise to a new way of listening, in which albums are
consumed in search of just a bar or two in which an instrument, be
it drums or voice, can be heard without accompaniment, so it can be
cleanly sampled and used as the foundation of a new song. For Moby
on ``Play'' that music was the field recordings made by folk music
archivists John and Alan Lomax and others from the first half of
this century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I discovered the Alan Lomax stuff, and I didn't get excited
about them because of the cultural context,'' Moby said last week,
sitting down for an interview at the Bar Marmont in Los Angeles.
``I got excited about them because I liked the performances, and
they were well recorded a cappella, which, as an electronic
musician, meant that I could sample them and write songs around
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Honey,'' Moby grabs phrases and hand claps from the
Lomax-aided Sea Island singer Bessie Jones, adding slide guitar and
a piano-driven beat not unlike the one Dr. Dre reinterprets in the
hit ``California Love.'' And he emotionally charges ``Why Does My
Heart Feel So Bad?'' by adding string and keyboard melodies in
pitch with pleas from the Shining Light Gospel Choir.
</P>
<P>
   When he played early versions of these songs for people, Moby
said, one friend warned that he might be lambasted for using some
of these recordings. ``The fact that I was a white kid from the
20th century sampling African-American vocals from the early 20th
century had never even crossed my mind,'' he said. ``In the long,
nonillustrious history of white people pilfering African American
culture, have I just perpetrated that? I'm motivated by a love for
the music and by a love of the performances, and I really hope I
haven't done anything bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Seen in another light, Moby is an update of Alan Lomax, helping
to spread and continue the legacy of traditional American ballads
and folk songs. The way Moby uses these recordings to construct
fully realized songs that are more than just beats with sampled
phrases is likely to inspire other musicians to do the same. And
whether that is an honor to or a disrespecting of the original
recordings is up to the musical morality of the listener.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best hip-hop beats incorporate the surface noise of
a vinyl record playing an old funk beat into the music. In the same
way Moby didn't try to eliminate the hiss and noise from the old
recordings he used.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like noise,'' he said. ``It's always puzzled me why one of
the goals of contemporary recording is to get rid of noise and to
eliminate any element of a performance. In some of the greatest
recordings ever made, the performance is a part of the recording.
Dylan's ``Rainy Day Women No. 12 and 35'' is all about the esthetic
of that performance. You can hear the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times good, pristine recordings prevent the listener
from getting emotionally involved in the music.''
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with other albums by Moby, a musician more likely to
be found reading The Economist than a music magazine, ``Play''
includes extensive liner notes musing on religion, politics and the
environment. In this case the essays concern prisoner rights,
fundamentalism, veganism, genocide and a message insisting that the
essays and the music are unrelated.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you hate the essays, you might still like the music,'' he
writes, hoping that his ideology won't scare off potential fans.
Then in a note of characteristic humility he adds, ``And if you
like the essays, you might hate the music.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the old burden of having to be a face for techno, Moby,
with even more humility, says that was never a goal. ``I didn't
think of myself in those terms because I always thought other
people made better records than I did,'' he said. ``Even when
people were saying I was the king of techno or whatever, I never
for a second thought of myself like that.''

   Broadway Hero? It's Letterman
</P>
<P>
   David Letterman's ``Late Show'' on CBS rode to the rescue of the
Broadway show ``It Ain't Nothin' but the Blues'' Tuesday, offering
a home for the production number from that musical that was bumped
from the network's Sunday night broadcast of the Tony Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Burnett, the executive producer of the ``Late Show,'' said
Tuesday that he has booked the number for the Letterman show
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The producers of ``It Ain't Nothin' but the Blues,'' who were
upset enough Sunday night to say that the bumping might lead to the
show's closing, had hired a lawyer in the hope of some kind of
compensation from the groups that put on the Tonys, the League of
American Theaters and the American Theater Wing.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of that performance, which was squeezed out when the
broadcast started to run late, was one of many problems with the
show. A recap of the awards given out earlier in the evening _ and
shown on PBS _ was also cut. A segment of dramatic readings from
nominated plays, inserted late into the broadcast, added to the
controversy when the musical number was cut.
</P>
<P>
   The problems, including a precipitous drop in ratings, left some
executives at CBS feeling more than a little frustrated about the
way the Tony broadcast was being run.
</P>
<P>
   CBS was already extremely unhappy that the two groups that put
on the show had failed to secure the services of Rosie O'Donnell as
the host once again this year. In the two previous years, with Ms.
O'Donnell as host, the show's ratings, in decline for years, had
soared.
</P>
<P>
   This year they plummeted again. The national rating came in at a
7, down from an 8.4 last year and a 9.6 the year before. (Each
rating point represents 980,000 homes.)
</P>
<P>
   CBS, which has a contract to broadcast the Tonys through 2004,
has a yearly option that would allow the network to drop out of the
show if it chose to do so. But the network quietly let it be known
that it is not thinking of exercising the option.
</P>
<P>
   The only CBS executive willing to comment on the record about
this year's show was Chris Ender, the vice president for media
relations. ``Obviously nobody wanted it to turn out like this,'' he
said. ``You always want higher ratings and less controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Letterman show stepped quickly into the breach, with Burnett
contacting the producers from ``It Ain't Nothin' but the Blues''
Tuesday afternoon after he had cleared an opening for a musical
guest Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he had done it, Burnett said, ``David Michael
Letterman has always been a champion of the American theater.''
</P>
<P>
   As for what he had said to convince the producers of the show,
Burnett had another joke: ``We had to guarantee them they wouldn't
get bumped.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Eric Krebs, one of the producers of the musical,
is thrilled. ``It's absolutely stupendous that the Letterman show
called,'' he said. ``And it's really important to us.'' Krebs said
the show was barely breaking even and needed the exposure from the
Tony awards show to help bring in tourists this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tony show speaks to 5 million or so fans of musicals,'' he
said. ``So this doesn't make up for that. But we are totally elated
to have this opportunity.''

   Faulted Hospital Closes
</P>
<P>
   On April 21, a few hours before Ed Bradley's hourlong special
report on abuses of children in the nation's largest chain of
psychiatric hospitals was to be broadcast on CBS News' ``60 Minutes
II,'' the chain sought a restraining order to block CBS from
showing the report. A judge denied the request on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Now the chain, Charter Behavioral Health Systems, is shutting
down the hospital that was the focus of the ``60 Minutes II''
report, Charter Pines in Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pretty extraordinary,'' Bradley said Tuesday.
``I've never been involved in a story with that kind of a direct
impact.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the 89-hospital chain, Karen Jenkins, refused
to say whether the CBS News report played a role in the decision to
close Charter Pines, saying that the move was based only on the
company's own internal review.
</P>
<P>
   The report relied heavily on film obtained with a hidden camera,
something news organizations now tend to avoid because several have
lost lawsuits as a result of such methods. In this case, the camera
was in the eyeglasses of a licensed social worker who was hired by
the hospital as an aide after agreeing to work undercover for CBS.
</P>
<P>
   He recorded a nurse's entering fabricated information on
patients' records (saying it had to be done to get insurance
payments); doctors who arrived late and made cursory updates of
patient charts without examining the patients, and admittedly
ill-trained workers handling troublesome patients without trained
supervision. In one instance, burly aides could be seen forcing a
teen-age patient into wrist and ankle restraints even though he had
a wrist injury they were obviously re-injuring.
</P>
<P>
   David Gelber, the segment's producer, said Tuesday that great
care had been taken in the use of the hidden camera. ``We got
someone who was qualified for the job, and we didn't lie about who
he was,'' he said. He said the report could not have been done
without the hidden camera, because hospital officials would not
explain their procedures for the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very careful,'' Bradley said, ``And the bottom line
is, Charter didn't sue us _ they closed the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly for Bradley and the producers, who had worked for a year
on the program, it was broadcast the night after the Littleton,
Colo., school shootings, and a ``Dateline'' special on NBC trounced
``60 Minutes II'' in the Nielsen ratings.
</P>
<P>
   To help make up for that, next Wednesday night at 10, after a
regular edition of ``60 Minutes II,'' CBS will run the report
again, with updates.

   Comparing Flours &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the difference in flour made from spring wheat and
winter wheat?
</P>
<P>
   A. Spring wheat is sowed in the Northern United States and
Canada in spring and harvested in late summer, said Joe Caron, a
spokesman for King Arthur Flour. It is generally the faster-growing
``hard'' variety. When ground, hard spring wheat yields a
high-protein, high-gluten flour well suited for baking bread,
bagels and some pastas.
</P>
<P>
   Winter wheat is a slow-growing type that is sowed in the fall,
goes dormant over the winter and is harvested in mid- to late
spring. In the United States, winter wheat is grown from Texas to
Kansas and may be either ``hard'' or ``soft.'' In general, winter
wheat flour has less protein than spring wheat flour. It is best
for pastries, cakes and cookies. Many bakers say that it is more
flavorful than spring wheat because of its longer growing season.
</P>
<P>
   Although most brands of flour do not indicate the type of wheat,
bread flours are almost always made from hard spring wheat and
pastry flours from soft winter wheat. All-purpose flour is usually
a mix of several types.
</P>
<P>
   Butter Goes Gently Into a Good Batter  &QL; 
Q. I have been having a lot of trouble making a genoise sponge. It
somehow splits into two layers and comes out with a rubbery
texture. I take care to fold in the flour and butter carefully,
even lightening the melted butter with some of the beaten egg
first. What's going wrong?
</P>
<P>
   A. Making a perfect genoise cake takes practice, especially if
the recipe calls for butter: it adds richness and tenderness but
requires a delicate balance between beating the batter enough to
incorporate it but not so much that the eggs deflate.
</P>
<P>
   Your batter may not have been beaten enough. While you don't
want to overdo it, it's essential to fold the butter into the
batter very, very thoroughly, until no streaks of melted butter are
visible.
</P>
<P>
   Another trick, from Rose Levy Beranbaum's ``The Cake Bible''
(William Morrow, 1988), is to add the melted butter when it's still
warm but not hot. Once the butter begins to solidify, it becomes
harder to incorporate and can weigh down the cake.
</P>
<P>
   No Fear of a Clove Shortage &QL; 
Q. Is there a worldwide shortage of ground cloves? I finally found
a tiny jar with } ounce (21 grams) in a supermarket for $7.19!
</P>
<P>
   A. Fear not: there are plenty of cloves to go around. That jar
was probably just a high-end brand using the best of the harvest.
The cloves were probably also packaged soon after grinding to
maintain freshness.
</P>
<P>
   Good cloves can be found for much less. One option is to buy
spices in bulk from a store with high turnover. They should smell
pleasantly pungent, with no traces of an off odor.
</P>
<P>
   You can also buy by mail. Penzey's Spices, (414) 679-7207, sells
\ cup (1.2 ounces) of ground cloves for $2.29.
</P>
<P>
   If Worms Show Up in the Fish Fillet &QL; 
Q. Recently I purchased lemon sole at a reputable fish market. I
put it in the pan to saute and was horrified to see two very thin
worms, about two inches long, crawling out of the flesh. The vendor
refunded my money and explained that this condition is endemic to
certain fish. What kinds of fish are these? Do the worms pose any
danger if ingested?
</P>
<P>
   A. Fish that feed on the bottom of the ocean, like haddock,
flounder and sole, are especially susceptible to parasites, said
Dr. Mike Timmons, professor of agriculture and biological
engineering and director of the Cornell Aquaculture Program at
Cornell University.
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't impractical, the fish fillets could be put on a
light table and screened for worms before being sold. But most fish
are worm-free.  &QL;

`THE LAST CIGARETTE': SMOKING, FROM DIVINE TO DISGUSTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Coughs due to smoking disappear! Parched throat clears up!
That stale, smoked-out feeling vanishes!'' Those claims for a
miracle cure can be found in ``The Last Cigarette,'' a witty but
deliberately choke-inducing documentary by Kevin Rafferty and Frank
Keraudren about the mystique of smoking in America. The real
miracle turns out to be somewhat different: that those claims were
once used to promote even more smoking, with the promise that
``when you change to Philip Morris you'll feel better.'' And that
the glamour of the cigarette habit has been so successfully
manufactured for so long.
</P>
<P>
   A horde of film clips illustrate the movie shorthand of a
meaningful gesture and a lighted cigarette. It was an especially
valuable prop in the days when films required visual metaphors for
what they could not otherwise say, as in a romantic scene that ends
with Jennifer Jones and a bare-chested William Holden locking eyes
while touching their cigarettes together. And by angrily throwing a
cigarette away, John Wayne could make himself look even tougher.
There are even glimpses of latter-day smoke-porn videos in which a
fully clothed woman, perhaps one with two-inch talons and a tattoo,
does nothing but smoke her cigarette and talk about it. And it goes
without saying that an actor who pauses before exhaling looks
thoughtful, even if he's not.
</P>
<P>
   As in Rafferty's earlier ``Atomic Cafe,'' anything goes. This is
a film for anyone who'd like to see a frog smoke, or two human
lovebirds puff from a single heart-shaped holder. There are also
amusing clips from ultra-square educational films with the look of
the early 1950s. An instructor demonstrates what one drop of pure
nicotine can do to a laboratory rodent, then helpfully points out,
``Now fortunately, man is many times larger than a mouse.'' Having
seen this (and it's not a pretty sight), one of his listeners
shakes his head and says: ``No kidding, doc, you really have
convinced me.'' And the doctor's final warning to the audience is
as real as it is quaint: ``Don't forget, tobacco is a loaded
pistol. And time pulls the trigger.''
</P>
<P>
   While films like ``Atomic Cafe'' and ``Reefer Madness''
addressed exaggerated perils (the atomic bomb and marijuana,
respectively), this one is essentially more sober and stays closer
to reality. Much of ``The Last Cigarette,'' which opens today at
the Film Forum, is essentially a fancifully illustrated look at
C-SPAN, with much time devoted to 1994 congressional hearings that
summoned the chief executives of major tobacco companies. Quietly
outrageous excerpts from these hearings find them claiming not to
care whether their children or grandchildren smoke, touting the
grownup appeal of Joe Camel and excelling in carefully bland
double-talk. Asked whether smoking is addictive, the research
director of Philip Morris replies, ``It is a very complicated
question, which requires an extremely complicated answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Less complicated are the film's howlers. They reveal the absurd
extremes of pitchmanship that have shaped smoking's public image,
like when Julie London sings ``You get a lot to like from a
Marlboro'' as if it were the sexiest song ever written and as if
cigarettes were definitely beside the point. Behind the funny
naivete seen in some of the film clips, there is an awareness of
nicotine's real hold in the smoker. In a scene from ``Black Robe,''
missionaries tell Indians that they won't need tobacco (or women)
in paradise, only to have the Indians laugh pityingly.
</P>
<P>
   There's a certain repetitiveness to the sight of famous people
smoking, as in the film's many glimpses of Albert Einstein puffing
on his pipe. And ``The Last Cigarette'' would have benefited from
incorporating more up-to-date views of smoking and its well-managed
image.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the filmmakers have enterprisingly looked for the truth
about smoking and found it in the strangest places, like Michael
Curtiz's 1950 film, ``Bright Leaf,'' in which Gary Cooper plays a
19th-century North Carolina businessman who is approached with a
proposition to manufacture cigarettes in large numbers. He thinks
about it, then exclaims: ``Anything like that'd make an awful lot
of money!'' In the same film, as the first cigarettes roll off the
assembly line, Lauren Bacall is on hand to enjoy Hollywood's
second-favorite fantasy.

 &HT;    THEATER OWNERS' GROUP TO CHECK ID'S AT R-RATED FILMS
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's campaign against excessive
violence in children's entertainment yielded its first major
results Tuesday when hundreds of theater owners agreed to require
photo identification of young people seeking admission to R-rated
movies.
</P>
<P>
   William Kartozian, president of the National Association of
Theater Owners, unveiled the new ID policy at the White House with
Clinton at his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us, I believe, have had our sensibilities heightened
since the recent tragedies at Columbine and in Georgia, and we as
theater owners feel our responsibilities as keenly as does
anybody,'' Kartozian said.
</P>
<P>
   The theater owners association has 700 members, described by
Kartozian as ``mom and pop'' operators, who control nearly 20,000
movie screens in the United States, about 65 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in the communities that we serve, and we want to be a
part of those communities and be a part of the solution to whatever
problems may be going on in your communities,'' Kartozian added.
</P>
<P>
   Kartozian said association members will display posters at their
box offices informing customers that ``every young person who comes
to the box office to see an R-rated movie (will be) asked to show a
photo ID.'' He said the association will also work with parent and
community organizations to promote the new policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that this will go a long way in carrying out our
responsibilities to the parents of America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Parents who want their children under 17 to see an R-rated movie
will still be able to buy tickets and escort them into theaters,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The president praised the theater owners for ``clearly drawing
the line'' in helping parents keep their children out of movies
that are not intended for viewers under the age of 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about the multiplex is that there's a movie
for every member of the family, but not every movie is for every
member of the family,'' Clinton said. ``When you drop them off, you
shouldn't have to worry about your G-rated kids getting into
violent or suggestive R-rated movies. Too often children do get
past the ticket counter, unescorted and under age.''
</P>
<P>
   He repeated his challenge to the movie industry to re-evaluate
its 30-year-old voluntary rating system, which categorizes movies
according to content and appropriate age levels of viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For rating systems to work, they must also be enforced, not
simply by watchful parents, but by retailers at the point of sales,
and theater owners at the multiplex,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Valenti, head of the Motion Picture Association of America,
applauded the ID requirement. ``It's a big step forward,'' he said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   However, other segments of the entertainment industry have not
been as responsive to the president's challenge as the theater
owners.
</P>
<P>
   At another White House event, an Oval Office meeting with
President Arpad Goncz of Hungary, Clinton acknowledged the ``public
ambivalence'' of entertainment executives about his anti-violence
campaign, but insisted their uncertainty is more about concern over
censorship than disagreement with his policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we all work at it ... so that nobody's pointing a finger at
anybody else, I think we'll have good participation from the
entertainment community,'' the president said. ``I'll be surprised
if we don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been pressuring the entertainment and gun industries
ever since the fatal student shootings at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo., two months ago and the wounding of students at
Heritage High School in Conyers, Ga., on the one-month anniversary
of the Columbine killings.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he asked the Justice Department and the Federal Trade
Commission to study the extent to which the video game, movie and
music industries market violence to children.
</P>
<P>
   Kartozian said his organization endorsed the idea of national
studies of the causes of teen violence. ``We believe it to be a
good idea to examine all factors which go into this very critical
problem,'' he said.
</P>

STILL A BLOND BOMBSHELL, BUT OF A CERTAIN AGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., June 13)  
(jt) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENZANO, Italy _ With Anita Ekberg, talk usually revolves around
the Fountain of Trevi, a monument forever associated with the scene
in ``La Dolce Vita'' in which she dances in its waters so
alluringly.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 40 years later, conversation wandered a few hundred yards
away, to the Spanish Steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Piazza di Spagna, in the '50s, I was completely mashed
by paparazzi. And the public. My blond hair,'' the Swedish-born
Miss Ekberg explained matter-of-factly. She added, more
dismissively: ``Now everybody is blond here. Have you seen a news
presenter on television that is not blond? I mean, there are more
blondes here, especially on Italian television, than in the whole
of Scandinavia. Really. And they are all dark Mediterranean. But
they all want to bleach their hair. Blond, blond, blond.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Ekberg, 68, is still blond, and she still wears her hair
long, falling in soft waves below her shoulders. During a recent
interview over a hearty restaurant lunch of sparkling Italian
prosecco, smoked salmon and assorted fresh seafood, her slanting
blue eyes were masked behind a pair of huge black-framed designer
sunglasses, but they were artfully evoked by a rock-size aquamarine
pendant and matching ring. Her figure, for which she was far more
famous, was concealed under a black tunic, black leggings and black
boots.
</P>
<P>
   It has been many decades since she looked like the dewy sex
goddess who entranced Marcello Mastroianni in Fellini's 1960
classic. Or sounded like one. Her once satiny, babyish whisper
(``Marcello, come, join me'') has become harsher with time and
tobacco. But with her deep, authoritative voice, imperious manner
and carefully tended face, she still looks and acts very much the
diva. Even more than her Arctic blondness and improbably full
figure, it was that quality that inspired Federico Fellini to weave
his satirical look at Roman decadence around her persona.
</P>
<P>
   And that is the quality that drove the Belgian director Yvan Le
Moine to cast her as a mercurial retired opera star in his feature
film debut, a Fellini-esque art film called ``The Red Dwarf,''
which opens in New York on June 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an easy choice. I needed someone famous, someone strong
and capricious who fit the part, a kind of retired diva,'' Le Moine
explained.
</P>
<P>
   It is less obvious why Miss Ekberg, who lives alone in quiet
semiretirement in her villa here, outside Rome, accepted the part
of a spoiled, overweight opera singer who has a sexual affair with
a dwarf.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, she said, took some time. ``I got the script in
Italian and English, and I thought it was so scabroso,'' Miss
Ekberg explained, her gravelly voice dropping an octave over the
Italian word for salacious. ``And I said no, no and no. I am not
going to do that kind of role, and they begged me and the director
came to Rome two or three times to try and convince me. `Ah, I need
you, I want you.''' She returned to her own voice. ``Actually, he's
not really a dwarf, you know; he just, he never really grew,'' she
said of her co-star, Jean-Yves Thual.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, shot in black-and-white, Thual plays a poetically
minded law clerk who becomes sexually obsessed with Countess Paola
Bendoni, a famous opera star, who, while seeking his services in a
divorce case, playfully allows him to seduce her. They make
ill-paired love, but she soon tires of him, and he strangles her in
a jealous passion. The camera lingers sometimes unkindly over Miss
Ekberg's heavily made up face and vast, flowing caftans, but the
rollicking bed scenes, she explained with a giggle, were actually
performed beneath the sheets by Thual and the actor (Arno Chevrier)
who plays her hulking gigolo husband.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Miss Ekberg had not made a film since 1996, when
she took a small part in a small Italian, R-rated film,
``Bambola,'' as a 70-year-old trattoria owner who dies in a gas
explosion early in the story, goes unmentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Miss Ekberg unfurled another motive. ``Lollobrigida
wanted to do it,'' she explained. ``Well, it's the kind of role
that would suit her,'' she said with a throaty laugh. ``I can't
stand her.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Ekberg has lived in Italy for the better part of three
decades, but her feud with the Italian sex symbol Gina
Lollobrigida, is only a few years old. They met for the first time,
she said, at a black-tie party given by a neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember it so well. I had on an emerald green chiffon long
evening gown,'' she said. ``In comes Lollobrigida, in August, with
a copy Chanel suit. Black. Wool. And boots. In August. And lots of
jewels. I always call her a Christmas tree.'' When Miss Ekberg went
up to introduce herself, she said, Ms. Lollobrigida cut her off and
walked away. She did it again at another party.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Ekberg got her revenge a month later, when both actresses
were booked on the same flight to Latin America. In the VIP lounge,
Miss Ekberg said, she instructed her secretary to buy some
sandwiches _ and to offer to buy Miss Lollobrigida some as well.
``She stood up and took my magazines without even asking, `May
I?''' Miss Ekberg recalled indignantly. ``They were sealed; she
just broke the seals and started to read just like that. And then,
when the sandwiches came she didn't even say to my secretary,
`Grazie,' much less offer to pay for hers.''
</P>
<P>
   On the flight, Miss Ekberg said that she carefully asked her
fellow first-class passengers if they minded if she smoked, and
recalled that they all eagerly told her to go ahead. As she lighted
her cigarette, from three rows away, she said, Miss Lollobrigida
bellowed: ``Anita, will you put out that cigarette? It smells like
hell!'' Miss Ekberg smiled wickedly and switched to Italian to
finish her tale.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I just looked at her and I said very loud, `Oh, Gina, why
don't you stop being such a pain.''' The audience, she said,
laughed appreciatively.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Lollobrigida, who is currently campaigning for a seat in
the European Parliament, said she had no interest in the opera star
role. ``I remember receiving an awful, vulgar script,'' she said.
``Obviously, I sent them to hell.'' She had more innocuous memories
of the airplane incident. ``Anita was smoking in a no-smoking area
and I cannot bear cigarette smoke,'' she recalled. ``I asked her to
put it out but she continued. That was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Ekberg quit smoking more than a year ago, cold turkey, to
prove a point to a friend who quit smoking and ``never stopped
whining about it.'' She said she had not missed cigarettes at all.
``I am strong and determined,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   It is sometimes hard to recall that this Anita Ekberg, who
speaks in a Bette Davis staccato, and recoiled when a waiter tried
to give her a water glass as if she had been slapped in the face
(``I never drink water at a meal,'' she said, waving for more
wine), was once the ripe blond goddess who drove men, and
especially Italian men, wild. ``Oh my God, her splendor was
incredible, her outsized, totally exaggerated beauty,'' Tullio
Kezich, a well-known Italian film critic and Fellini biographer,
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He interviewed her first on the set of ``La Dolce Vita'' and
kept up with her in the other Fellini films she made, a cameo in
``Boccaccio 70,'' a small part in the film ``Clowns'' in 1971. Then
there was the 1987 film ``Intervista,'' a mock documentary about
filmmaking, in which the director takes Mastroianni to her villa,
and the two stars, both aged and bloated, look at their younger,
lither selves in scenes from ``La Dolce Vita.'' That film was well
received, but most critics dwelled on the contrast between what she
looked like then and 27 years later.

   ``Anita is very simpatica, but not at all intelligent. Fellini
adored her, but he treated her like a big doll,'' Kezich recalled.
``I told him that people kept asking me to ask him if he had ever
slept with her, and Fellini laughed and replied, `By all means,
tell them yes.''' But Kezich gave credit to her spirit. ``She was a
horse. She plunged into that cold fountain in `La Dolce Vita'
without hesitation or a fuss. She was so Swedish and healthy; she
never caught cold. Marcello was terrorized at the idea of getting
wet.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Ekberg, who said she did not have any rapport with
Mastroianni _ ``He was always very closed up'' _ has fonder
memories of Fellini, who remained a friend until his death in 1993.
``I didn't speak Italian and he didn't speak English at that time.
We communicated by looking at each other. It was most amazing. We
didn't need dialogue very often. With the little Italian I knew,
and the little English he knew, we communicated very, very well.''
He called her ``Anitona,'' an endearment that underscores size and
that was quickly adopted by all Italians. ``I hated the name,'' she
said. ``But he gave nicknames to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Ekberg is not sentimental, however. She still fumes
recalling how Fellini insisted on filming ``Intervista'' at her
villa and allowed his crews to track mud onto her wall-to-wall
carpeting. ``They underpaid me a lot. That is for sure,'' she said
of the film. ``But I didn't know what to ask.'' These days, she is
more careful about money and charges $10,000 for a public
appearance _ and some interviews (though not this one). Such
requests, her agent said, are frequent and almost always linked to
``La Dolce Vita.''
</P>
<P>
   She grows indignant at the notion that Fellini discovered her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few movies of mine are available here,'' she said, when
asked which of her old films were available on videocassette.
``That is because they would like to keep up the story that Fellini
made me famous, Fellini discovered me,'' she said, tossing her
head. ``So many have said they discovered me.''
</P>
<P>
   She has more than 50 other films to her credit. A former Miss
Sweden who was born in Malmo, she moved to Hollywood in 1951 and
soon became sufficiently famous to play herself, a busty sex
symbol, in a 1956 Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis comedy, ``Hollywood
or Bust.'' Aside from playing Helene in the 1956 version of ``War
and Peace,'' directed by King Vidor, however, most of her movies
have titles like ``Sheba and the Gladiator'' (she played Queen
Zenobia of Palmyra) and have faded from memory.
</P>
<P>
   The part of Sylvia, a lovely, capricious Hollywood star who goes
to Rome on a shoot in ``La Dolce Vita,'' however, is immortal.
``Anita dancing in that fountain is one of the 10 great movie
images of the century,'' Kezich said.``Even today, advertisements
still recall it _ it is such a lasting moment of cinema.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellini, who didn't believe in writing out scripts, borrowed
freely from Miss Ekberg's life to create her character. Sylvia,
like Anita Ekberg, was a glamorous sex symbol hounded by paparazzi,
and who traveled with a large entourage that included an alienated,
hard-drinking husband. Miss Ekberg's own estranged mate was Anthony
Steel, a fading British matinee idol whose drinking destroyed his
career. They divorced in 1963, and the following year she married
another B-movie actor, Rik Van Nutter, and that marriage ended in
1975.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, she dismissed both marriages as
``unfortunate'' and chose not to dwell on her past love affairs,
though in her heyday she was romantically linked with some of the
most famous men in the world, from Gary Cooper to the Italian
industrialist Gianni Agnelli.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, she mostly examines the ravages time has also
wrought on others. ``He was so beautiful,'' she said of the French
actor Alain Delon, whom she met in the early 1960s. ``He has not
aged well, I think. But there again, if a woman gets older _ and we
all do get wrinkles _ so do the men. But they criticize the woman,
and they don't necessarily criticize the actor; he can look like
hell. Look at Marlon Brando: the last pictures of him, he's like a
wine keg. Really.''
</P>
<P>
   Flamboyant in interviews, Miss Ekberg is described by colleagues
as actually reserved and very private. She almost never goes home
to Sweden, she said, and gets along with only one of her seven
siblings. And in Italy, she goes out only rarely, she said,
explaining that her girlfriends gave up on her because she would
never leave the house without spending hours applying makeup. ``As
if I could go out in a scarf and a track suit, like some ordinary
housewife,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a tough hide, and she is very strong and willful,
funny, and very exaggerated, very Hollywood,'' Le Moine explained.
``But there is something also touching about her. She lives alone,
in solitude and great fragility.''

`THE ARTIST'S WIDOW': PLUCKY IN A BATTLE AGAINST FRAILTY AND
TORMENTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD EDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are images of bereavement, after a long and devoted
marriage that has a painter's widow attending a retrospective show
of her late husband's work and reflecting, as if he were there too:
``It was the sort of party John and Lyris Crane hated.'' Then, in
the swirling currents of snobbery, canape jostling, bluff
congratulations and deep indifference, Lyris' mind heels before a
different, valedictory gust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lyris felt a pang of envy for John, among the flowers and
berries of the crematorium gardens. But the trees would be
gathering darkness now, the reeds and bulrushes whispering, a
chilly dew rising to meet the rain. Time to come indoors.'' Later,
after a cheap dinner given by the gallery owner, ostensibly in her
honor but full of people she doesn't know, she goes home to
exchange the torture of tight blue shoes for a pair of John's
slippers. ``Kind boats,'' she thinks: two words that tell the
lifelong history of a couple.
</P>
<P>
   Shena Mackay is wise about shoes and old age. If fish rot from
the mouth down, we grow old from the feet up. The abiding theme in
``The Artist's Widow,'' the filament that lights it, is the
portrait of Lyris, herself a painter, rallying against sorrow,
solitude, frailty, the drifts of confusion that intermittently
cloud a sharp vision and the fear that goes with the shift of
relative power between one's 80-year-old self and a surrounding
world that seems to threaten and sometimes really does.
</P>
<P>
   It is a filament only, though, and in a flawed, cloudy bulb. Ms.
Mackay, a Scottish novelist, knows some particular truths better
than just about anyone else, and in her best books _ ``The Orchard
on Fire'' and last year's ``An Advent Calendar'' _ she locates
truths that even she does not know. She is fierce and on the left;
her villains, mostly the various categories of Britain's
politically, economically or culturally privileged, are atrocious.
Her heroes, misused but sparky, are angelic: the downtrodden who
take wing. This is hard to get away with, but Ms. McKay uses
elusiveness, sudden shifts and reversals to manage it much of the
time, along with writing that can be sheer magic in short bursts
and comically unexpected in longer ones. The rule for a sad clown
is to be very lovely and very funny.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Artist's Widow'' the managing largely fails and the
clown's sadness is reduced to grimaces. It is a novel with a
winning center _ Lyris _ and a messed-up series of things that
happen to her, mainly other people. These divide into the author's
customary baddies and goodies, but the former are crudely and
exaggeratedly drawn and the latter turn out pat or pallid.
Comeuppances like so many gong strokes are in store for the former,
and happy endings for the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among Lyris' tormentors is Nathan, her great-nephew by
marriage: a loathsome and ultimately futile specimen of a young
artist on the make. He works in a grubby collective, each of whose
members tries to make sure that none of the others gets ahead. He
crashes the desirable parties, shamelessly flatters guests he
thinks useful and cultivates a repulsiveness that he understands to
be cutting-edge. Missing his 20 minutes of fame by a year or two,
he creates an installation with a bucket of entrails but has to
throw them out because of the stink.
</P>
<P>
   ``His eyelids, with a bristle of pale lashes, were tender and
his eyes dull green and hard,'' Ms. Mackay writes, employing a
fairly sharp scalpel. She switches to a bludgeon and Nathan becomes
``a pond with green scum on its surface.'' Language overkill is
spread around. An only moderately unpleasant woman is nicknamed
``The Wounded Squid'' because ``she was so clinging and so easily
hurt into squirting her purple sentimental ink over everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Lyris' dead husband gets splashed. ``The last canvases
burned with the brilliant chemical derangement of autumn when the
slow fuses smoldering up the stalks of senescent leaves burst into
mineral fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathan, backed by a Neanderthal father connected with the East
End mob, has designs on Lyris' house and art collection. He sneaks
into her house, scaring her almost literally to death. Possibly
mistaking it for water, he offers her a drink of denatured alcohol
and proceeds to flatter her about the inspiration she and her
husband have been. She briefly melts _ Ms. Mackay gives a plausible
explanation but it is pretty awkward _ and then he steals her
purse.
</P>
<P>
   With all his awfulness, Nathan has no more reality than a
cutout. (At the end, when he is destroyed several different ways,
his seeming repentance is simply the cutout reversed.) Neither does
Zoe, his partner, who blasts in on Lyris to make a television
feature about neglected painter-wives of famous painters. This
happens near the beginning, and for a while it seems that Zoe's
brashness conceals something redemptive and that a promising theme
will take shape. Like a number of other false starts, this one
peters out.
</P>
<P>
   As for the good guys, there is Jackie, brutally ditched by
Nathan and doubly brutalized at work when her black supervisor
accuses her of racism for growing dreadlocks and pretending to be
half black. Far-fetched, I know; equally so is Jackie's asking
Lyris for sanctuary, settling in and eventually restoring the old
woman's life and hope.
</P>
<P>
   Other good guys include a sensible plumber and his wife, and
Candy, mistress of a married Conservative member of Parliament who
for 20 years used her like ``a weevil feeding on bread buttered on
both sides.'' Principally nice, apart from Lyris, is Clovis, a
gentle, mixed-up bookseller. He is plunged into near lethal despair
when he fails to come to the aid of a man caught in a subway
up-escalator as he rode down. ``I am doomed,'' he tells himself.
Doom and kindness wrap him in a formless cloud right to the end,
when Candy's efforts to rescue him may perhaps succeed.
</P>
<P>
   There are several other dispensations of justice, but they come
pell-mell as if a doll's tea party had been issued a sudden closing
time. With plotlets and most of the characters shaped and exercised
so disjointedly, Ms. Mackay _ never tidy but able to draw charming
provocation out of anarchy _ has managed only sporadically
promising confusion.

IN SERBIAN HOLY LAND, FEARS OF AN AVENGING KLA 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVO POLJE, Serbia _ This is the place where the Serbian
national consciousness was born in a noble slaughter, and the Serbs
of Kosovo Polje are both anxious and defiant. They are less
concerned about the imminent influx of NATO soldiers than about the
Kosovo Liberation Army and the Albanian capacity for revenge.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Serbs who may live in more isolated villages here in
Kosovo, these Serbs, only a few miles from the capital, Pristina,
are not ready to leave their homes and businesses and begin new
lives as refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is holy Serbian land,'' said Ljubisa Lazic, 53, a jovial
telephone inspector who suddenly turned serious. ``Our churches and
our graves are like a stop sign to us _ they don't let us leave
here. If we did, we would be damned anywhere in the world we go,
both us and our children.''
</P>
<P>
   His friend, Petar Rapajic, scoffs at such fervor, blaming the
disaster of Kosovo on bad leadership in Belgrade, Washington and
London that allowed the rise of the KLA. But he also acknowledges
that many Serbs have behaved criminally here in this war against
the Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Rapajic has no intention of leaving Kosovo, he said, but in the
last few days other Serbs have begun to depart. On Tuesday, driving
south from Belgrade, numerous Serbian cars, with belongings packed
on their roofs, were passed heading north toward central Serbia.
There were also at least 10 large trucks and buses filled with
soldiers and military equipment also leaving Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serbs are afraid, and for good reason,'' Rapajic said. ``There
are a lot of burned houses and destroyed lives, and they fear
revenge. They did a lot of bad things to the Albanians that
shouldn't have been done _ killings and burnings _ and they're
afraid that the KLA will appear.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he felt about the Serbian army and police withdrawing
from Kosovo, he said: ``The problem isn't that they are leaving.
The problem is if the KLA comes in. People aren't afraid of NATO or
the United Nations, but of the KLA. And they're not sure that the
foreigners will protect them or fight the KLA. After all, NATO
fought for the KLA.''
</P>
<P>
   The defining myth of Serbian statehood is here in this region,
on Kosovo Polje, the field of blackbirds, where the Serbs lost
nobly to the Turks 610 years ago this month. The Serbian commander,
Prince Lazar, is revered as a saint, but few here are willing to
give the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, that much
reverence.
</P>
<P>
   A young woman, a Serb who would not give her name, said she
would leave Kosovo. She was very anxious about the future, and
furious about this defeat. ``I will kill him,'' she said softly and
slowly, referring to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that his policies had produced Serbian refugees before,
from Bosnia and Croatia, she said: ``It doesn't matter. I will kill
him for all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rapajic, 47, owns four auto service stores and rents another
here. He lives in Devet-Jugovica, a mixed Serbian-Albanian village
8 miles north of Pristina, and he described matter-of-factly how
Serbian paramilitary police burned Albanian houses, sometimes
helped by Serbian neighbors, and how the KLA had killed a man and
his two sons in front of their house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have traumas,'' he said. ``It can't be that the KLA comes to
a house and murders a family, and Serbs can't burn and steal and
loot. God gave no one the right to do these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Rapajic said that the Albanians of his village had fled out of
fear, but that when he attempted to stop the burning of their empty
homes, he was nearly shot by the police. ``They said I was a
traitor to my people and they pointed their guns at me,'' he said.
``So I stepped back.'' It may have been brave, he acknowledged.
``But I don't know how clever it was. But I built my house myself,
and I felt on my skin what it is to build a house.''
</P>
<P>
   When he kept a car for an Albanian friend who fled, Rapajic was
interrogated by 20 military policemen who searched his house.
``They wanted to know how many Albanians I know, how I know them,
why I drove them around,'' he said. ``They asked me for a satellite
telephone and almost said I was working against the state.''
</P>
<P>
   He stopped, laughing. ``I don't even know what a satellite
telephone looks like.''
</P>
<P>
   The police took the car, which they insisted was stolen.
</P>
<P>
   But Rapajic also believes that NATO's decision to bomb set off
the worst of the catastrophe, enraging Serbs against the Albanians
and giving them the pretext for terrible crimes. And this solution,
he says, ``won't solve the problem of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   That is rooted in competing claims to the land, he said, ``and
there is a lot of hatred now.'' Like many Serbs, he would prefer to
divide Kosovo and give the Albanians their own territory, but he
acknowledges that it may be too late for that.
</P>
<P>
   Dragisa Nikolic is prepared to keep fighting. Now 43, he was
mobilized into the army and was wounded May 19 by a KLA sniper near
Grabovac, in the Cicavica mountains only 15 miles northwest of
Pristina. Three more members of his 11-man patrol were wounded in
the same KLA ambush.
</P>
<P>
   Only Monday, he said, a friend of his from here, Marko Vujacic,
37, with three children, was killed, shot in the head by a sniper
100 yards from where Nikolic was wounded.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, driving toward the Macedonian border town of Djeneral
Jankovic, an Israeli journalist, Ron Ben-Yishai of Yediot Aharonot,
and a Serbian driver, Ivan Cvejic, were wounded near Kacanik when
their car was fired upon by snipers.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The KLA is still a big problem,'' Nikolic said, his arm in a
sling and his dogtag poking out over his black polo shirt. ``I'll
fight them again, and I won't leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he believe that NATO forces will demilitarize the KLA?
``NATO will demilitarize us, not the KLA,'' he said. ``NATO works
for them.'' But he said he would not try to fight the peacekeeping
forces. ``Our struggle is not with them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His friend, Boza Tadic, says he will also stay and take his
chance. He is one of the hundreds of thousands of Serbs ethnically
purged from Croatia in 1995 and resettled in Kosovo. ``So where do
I go now?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Two young men, Aleksandar Zivic, 18, and Milan Stanovic, 17,
said they were very nervous, and so were their parents, who talk a
lot about leaving. Zivic's father and Stanovic's father and brother
have been mobilized and are ``in the field'' with the army, and the
young men are very worried about them, too, as the bombing campaign
continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life might become impossible here,'' Zivic said. Why?
``Because the Albanians will be on top.'' And what might they do?
Stanovic said: ``Maybe worse things than what we did to them.''

A REBEL WITH RED HAIR RUMPLES STUFFED SHIRTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., June 13) 
(jt) 
 By LAURA WINTERS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Not many films have inspired both a hair color  &UR; and &LR; 
a conservative politician's campaign poster. But the German
director Tom Tykwer's ``Run Lola Run'' certainly did.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which has sold more than 2 million tickets in Germany
and which opens here on June 17, is the anarchically charged story
of a flame-haired punk, Lola (Franka Potente), who races through
the streets of Berlin in a desperate attempt to save her
boyfriend's life. After ``Run Lola Run'' was released in Germany
last year, girls started dyeing their hair a shade that quickly
became known as ``Lola red.'' And displayed throughout the city was
an image of the mayor of Berlin, Eberhard Diepgen, running above
the caption ``Diepgen Rennt'' (``Run Diepgen'').
</P>
<P>
   Tykwer took legal steps to halt the posters, but the Diepgen
episode nonetheless confirmed the widespread appeal of the film's
speeding kaleidoscope of color, music and narrative techniques _
techniques that go beyond spoken language. ``Run Lola Run'' was one
of the two most popular German films of 1998 and had success
internationally as well: it shared the World Cinema Audience Award
at the Sundance Film Festival in January and was chosen to open the
recent New Directors/New Films series at the Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its daring, kinetic style, the film is succeeding in
Germany and elsewhere because it so effectively evokes a prevailing
cultural mood. ```Run Lola Run' symbolizes very much where we are
now, and especially where the young people in Germany are,'' said
Dieter Kosslick, executive director of the Filmstiftung
Nordrhein-Westfalen, a public agency in Duesseldorf that helped to
finance the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lola'' is the third feature directed by the 33-year-old
Tykwer, who conceived of it as a rebellious cry against what he
sees as the sclerotic society of today's Germany. ``I wanted to do
a film about the energy of my generation,'' he said recently in a
cafe near Lincoln Center, ``an energy which all too often is kept
bottled up inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very strong feeling among young people today that no
matter what we do, we can't change things anymore. After all,
Helmut Kohl was in power for 16 whole years in Germany. But with
`Lola,' I wanted to do a story of this energy breaking the chains
of our existence.''
</P>
<P>
   The premise of the movie is simple: by telephone, Lola learns
that her boyfriend, Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu), has lost a bag
containing 100,000 marks that he was supposed to give to his
sinister thug of a boss. Lola promises the desperate Manni that in
20 minutes she will come up with the money to save his life, and
she sets off, hurtling through the streets.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Tykwer creates three different versions of this
20-minute trajectory, with each version set at the same time but
unfolding differently and concluding with a different ending. ``I
wanted to make it feel like a completely classical drama,'' he
said. ``With three acts, and this big task where she has to get the
Holy Grail.''
</P>
<P>
   These are not three acts in a conventional sense, however, but
three versions of reality that blur the strictures of time and
space.
</P>
<P>
   Though the film was shot for only $2 million, Tykwer employed an
arsenal of techniques, from animation and split screen to the
alternation of film, video and still photography. ``I think Tykwer
is the first person since Fassbinder to do something radically
different in German cinema,'' said Laurence Kardish, curator of
film and video at the Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   Tykwer acknowledges that he was influenced by music videos and
video games, but he insists that his creative mix goes much
further.
</P>
<P>
   ``In asking the question `What can happen in your life, what
chances do you have?' I wanted also to ask the question `What
possibilities can there be in filmmaking?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In person, the director is both playful and serious, like his
movie. Tall and rangy, sporting a windbreaker, he has an
unpretentious sense of humor but also an unvarnished intensity. A
self-taught filmmaker who was a projectionist for 15 years, he has
always been drawn by what he calls ``elements of fate and
coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Tykwer's first feature, ``Deadly Maria'' (1993), is the caustic
depiction of a woman's attempt to free herself from an abusive
husband and an invalid father. ``Wintersleepers'' (1997) is a moody
study of four friends' interlocked relationships, set against the
wintry Alps.
</P>
<P>
   Tykwer also was a co-writer for the film ``Life Is All You Get''
(1997), a seriocomic portrait of Berliners directed by Wolfgang
Becker.
</P>
<P>
   All these films are different in style. ``Rather than just
trying a formula, Tom is someone who's inventing his own,'' said
Richard Pena, program director of the Film Society of Lincoln
Center, which presents the New Directors/New Films series with the
Modern.
</P>
<P>
   Tykwer's innovative career is a sign of a larger spirit of
expansion in the German film industry right now. He has made all of
his movies with the production company X-Filme Creative Pool, which
he and several other filmmakers formed in Berlin in 1994. Their
aim, as Stefan Arndt, Tykwer's producer, says, was ``to build a new
force for German films to be successful both in Germany and in
other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, there was barely any market for German films
within Germany itself. The box office was dominated by American
movies, as it is today. But with the blossoming of a new sort of
German relationship comedy _ films like Soenke Wortmann's ``Maybe
... Maybe Not'' (1994) and Rainer Kaufmann's ``Talk of the Town''
(1995) _ Germans started to return to German films. And with these
films came a new generation of directors and stars: directors like
Wortmann and Detlev Buck, actors like Til Schweiger and then Ms.
Potente and Bleibtreu.
</P>
<P>
   Although the comedies have continued in recent years, other
sorts of films are also gaining attention. Caroline Link's ``Beyond
Silence,'' a 1998 drama about a young musician with
hearing-impaired parents, was nominated for an Oscar. And, along
with ``Lola,'' Joseph Vilsmaier's ``Comedian Harmonists'' (released
in the United States as ``The Harmonists''), based on the true
story of a German singing group in Nazi Germany, was the most
successful German film of last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The comedies brought us back our audience, and now we're going
in a more serious vein,'' said Kosslick.
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately enough, given the themes in ``Lola,'' Tykwer made
the movie rather quickly, writing the script at the end of 1996 and
filming in the streets of Berlin in the summer of 1997. During the
shoot, the details in all three versions of Lola's 20-minute sprint
had to be consistent. ``We were terrified that the weather would
change,'' recalled Maria Kopf, the head of production.
</P>
<P>
   For the 24-year-old Ms. Potente, the film was a physical
workout. ``I'm a smoker,'' she confided at breakfast in New York
recently. With two-toned nail polish and her naturally dark hair
now blond for another role, Ms. Potente, in person, has a lot of
Lola's dynamism.
</P>
<P>
   To incarnate Lola, she dyed her hair and sported the vivid
hairdo for six weeks straight. ``Little babies loved it,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tykwer and Ms. Potente are now a couple, but they weren't at the
time the movie was made. Asked why he chose Ms. Potente for the
role, Tykwer said: ``I wanted this person to be believable.
Franka's not a trained runner; she's just normal. Both she and
Moritz are the biggest stars in Germany, but they both have this
incredible capacity to attract empathy.''
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old Bleibtreu, who has a bright-eyed, hip assurance
quite unlike Manni's bumbling panic, recalled Tykwer's
thoroughness. ``Tom gave us maps of our characters detailing who is
Manni, where does he come from, what is his astrological sign,'' he
said over coffee at a Manhattan hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Both actors believe that the characters they play are typical of
Germany today. ``In Berlin, a lot of people look like Lola,'' said
Ms. Potente.
</P>
<P>
   Bleibtreu put it this way: ``There's this whole generation of
kids living for the day, not really knowing what they want to do
with their lives, getting money here and there. The only thing
Manni has is Lola.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Berlin, which Lola crisscrosses repeatedly, becomes a kind of
character in the film. ``This could take place in any major city of
the world,'' said Tykwer. ``But Berlin is the perfect match,
because Lola is someone who is running between times and Berlin
itself is a city between eras. The whole center of town is a
construction site.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Tykwer now lives in Berlin, he grew up in Wuppertal,
near Duesseldorf, the son of a clothing salesman and a secretary.
Even as a child, he knew that he wanted to make films. At the age
of 10, he was creating Super-8 remakes of ``Godzilla,'' exploding
miniature houses in his backyard with firecrackers.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was 16, he was the projectionist at the movie
theater in Wuppertal. He would stay up every night watching movies
until dawn, then go to school. ``I can't tell you how many times I
fell asleep in my chair,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tykwer did not get into film school, but he continued his film
education on his own. When he was 20, he moved to Berlin, where he
studied philosophy and became the programmer of an art house, the
Moviemento. It was there that he met Arndt, the programmer for a
rival movie house, the Sputnik. Eager to start making films, they
and the filmmakers Dani Levy and Wolfgang Becker founded X-Filme.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the success of ``Lola,'' Tykwer has been
receiving job offers from Hollywood. He has chosen not to go that
route, but he and his partners at X-Filme, interested in seeking
overseas financing, have made a development and coproduction
agreement with Miramax Films. Miramax will have a first look at all
X-Filme properties and will submit possible projects to X-Filme
members as well.
</P>
<P>
   Both Arndt and Tykwer, however, stress the importance of their
remaining German filmmakers who tell German stories. ``My next film
is a love story set in my hometown, Wuppertal,'' said Tykwer. ``I
really know my way around there, and I have some stories to tell
which I hope will be much more individual and special than if I
take a script and translate it and shoot it in Houston, Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Production of the new film, ``The Princess and the Warrior,''
will start this summer, and if the title is any indication, it
should be quite different from ``Run Lola Run.'' The director will
say only that it's a contemporary love story, and that it will star
Ms. Potente.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a fair guess, however, that the film will touch on
the questions of fate and personal choice that interest Tykwer. He
gets reflective when asked to speculate further about the appeal of
``Lola.'' ``It's a film about passion, and the energy that comes
from passion,'' he said. ``I think a lot of people want to see a
film that believes in utopian elements. Utopian not in the
old-fashioned socialist sense, but in the sense of believing in the
power of inventiveness. The film invents its own system: it says,
`I don't care if the time is only 20 minutes, I'm going to make it
become 60 minutes.' Just as Lola says: `I don't care if I can't get
there. I'm just going to do it.'''

INDIA AND PAKISTAN SEEM READY TO TALK ABOUT KASHMIR  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ For the first time since fighting erupted in
the disputed province of Kashmir last month, senior Indian and
Pakistani officials seemed ready on Tuesday to discuss ways of
defusing the tension.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two countries remain far apart in their perceptions
of the crisis and the possible solutions, the indication that they
are ready for peace talks is certain to be welcomed by the outside
world. This is the first conflict to erupt along the border since
both countries successfully tested nuclear weapons last year, and
it has raised fears in some foreign capitals that hostilities could
worsen rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan had offered to send its foreign minister, Sartaj Aziz,
to New Delhi on Tuesday, but India had demurred, apparently hoping
to delay talks until its army could make more progress on the
ground. On Tuesday, India suggested Saturday, June 12, for the
talks. Aziz has accepted the invitation, Agence France-Press
reported from Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting broke out in Kashmir last month when Indian soldiers
sought to move back into their mountain positions along the border.
The Indians normally hold these positions in warmer months and
abandon them during the forbidding winter. But when they sought to
re-occupy them last month they came under fire. It soon became
clear that hostile forces had seized the snowy ridges on India's
side of the line of control.
</P>
<P>
   India describes the opposing forces as infiltrators supported by
Pakistan and including Pakistan army troops. Pakistan denies any
involvement and says the forces are Muslim rebels seeking to free
Kashmir from Indian control.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfair to call them infiltrators,'' said Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan. He described them as members of ``a
freedom movement.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The often violent conflict over Kashmir dates back to the
founding of India and Pakistan in 1947. Under an agreement that
neither side accepts, India came to control two-thirds of the
province and Pakistan the rest. Both claim all of it, and they have
fought two wars to assert their claims.
</P>
<P>
   Kashmir's maharaja at partition was Hindu and chose to be part
of India, but the people are mainly Muslim, and the region has
become a rallying point for Islamic militants around the world who
see it as unjustly subjected to the yoke of a Hindu power. India
contends that it respects the rights of the Muslims and offers them
every privilege.
</P>
<P>
   If negotiations begin as planned on Saturday, the agenda is
likely to be the first issue disputed. Pakistan does not agree that
it is a party to the conflict; it says it has done nothing to
promote the infiltration of fighters, and that none of them are
Pakistani soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Aziz, the Pakistani foreign minister, may seek to question the
legality of the division of Kashmir, a gambit India has vowed to
reject. In a nationally televised speech on Monday, India's prime
minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, said that if Pakistan seeks to
discuss the Kashmir issue as a whole, ``the proposed talks will be
over before they even begin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The subject is one and one alone: the intrusion, and how
Pakistan proposes to undo it,'' Vajpayee said.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting along the border is intense. Indian forces have been
bombarding hostile positions in the forbidding mountains, both from
the air and with artillery. India's strategy is evidently twofold:
agreeing to negotiate while pressing its military campaign to
regain control of the high ground along the border.
</P>
<P>
   India claims to have killed dozens of Pakistani soldiers on its
side of the border, but has not given the total. It has reported
the death of 63 Indian soldiers, with 217 wounded and 14 missing
and possibly captured.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of civilians have been forced to flee their homes in
Kashmir, overwhelming the local resources to provide them with
shelter and medical care.

FAA GIVES COMPUTERS BIGGER ROLE IN SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., June 13) 
(jt) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It may not be obvious to passengers, but the
Federal Aviation Administration is trying to close three weak spots
in airline security: relying on human judgment to spot suspicious
passengers, allowing checked bags to catch a connecting flight when
the suspicious passenger doesn't, and permitting baggage screeners
to grow complacent.
</P>
<P>
   But the remedies may still be at least two years away. On April
19, the FAA published a proposed new security rule, which is open
to public comment for 60 days, and the airlines' response was to
ask to extend the comment period another 60 days. It would require
that for all flights on planes with more than 60 seats, airlines
use computers with profiling software to identify suspicious
passengers instead of relying on airline personnel. The software
was developed with a federal subsidy, and most major airlines have
been using it voluntarily since January 1998; the FAA will not
reveal most of the criteria used by the software, but one of them
is whether the passenger paid cash for a ticket at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   When this computer profiling began, civil-liberties groups and
Arab American groups complained that it would be based on ethnicity
or religion and thus violate some passengers' rights. But the
Justice Department, privy to the criteria, ruled that the criteria
were not discriminatory. Now the FAA wants to make the automated
profiling mandatory, it says, partly because it eliminates ``the
potential perception of personal biases.'' Also, the FAA says, the
computer can juggle more factors than a ticket agent can, and if
the criteria are computerized, they will be easier to keep secret.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines have generally accepted profiling, which is
integrated into their reservations computers. On domestic flights,
the bags of passengers who meet the profile are either scanned for
explosives or are ``matched,'' meaning that they will not be
carried on a flight unless the passenger boards as well. (On
international flights, no bags are supposed to be carried unless
the owner is on board.)
</P>
<P>
   There are loopholes, however. If the bag is checked through to a
final domestic destination and the passenger is connecting on a
different airline, the second airline may not continue with this
``bag match'' procedure. Even if the passenger is connecting on the
same airline, the match may not occur on the second flight. The
fear is that a terrorist might fly to a hub with a checked bag,
``miss'' a connecting flight, then catch another and be out of the
country by the time the bag explodes. The new rule seeks to
eliminate both possibilities, but the airlines are fearful that
matching bags on the connecting flights would cause delays.
</P>
<P>
   One way to reduce the need for bag matching is to increase bag
screening, and this is gradually happening, with the installation
of additional sophisticated scanning machines that look for bombs
in checked bags. But the airlines have sometimes been slow to start
using these machines.
</P>
<P>
   Congress provided $157 million for such machines for the last
fiscal year and the current one, and the FAA is asking for another
$100 million for the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1. The initial
impetus for the program, the belief that the explosion on TWA
Flight 800 in July 1996 was a terrorist act, has been disproved,
but the security program continues.
</P>
<P>
   A far bigger cost than equipment is the cost to the airlines
from flight delays that bag screening or bag matching may cause.
The FAA's proposed rule includes a lengthy cost-benefit analysis of
why these expenses are still worthwhile, based on a hypothetical
example of preventing the destruction of one Boeing 737 with 73
passengers, each person with a value of $2.7 million, plus $16.5
million for the plane itself, $12.5 million in property damage,
$28.6 million for the investigation and $3.6 million for legal
fees, for a total of $271.8 million. Also included in the analysis
is the amount of business that the airlines would lose in
subsequent weeks as fearful travelers stayed home. (The whole
calculation, in the Federal Register notice of April 19, is
available at www.access.gpo.gov/sudocs/aces/aces140.html.)
</P>
<P>
   A simpler change already being made is a new method for testing
the alertness and training of the security screeners who look at
the monitors of X-ray machines or other kinds of scanners for hours
at a time, watching thousands of bags go by.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional test method is for FAA undercover agents to put
a weapon or a bomb into a carry-on or checked bag and see if the
screeners notice. But this has a high manpower cost; the carry-on
baggage screeners quickly learn to recognize the testers, so the
agents can run only a few tests at each airport.
</P>
<P>
   But the newest computers on airport concourses use ``threat
image projection,'' a technology that inserts the image of a weapon
into a bag. ``Every 50 to 100 bags, there could be a gun, a knife
or an improvised explosive device,'' said Tony Fainberg, director
of policy and planning for civil aviation security at the FAA. The
computers are attached to X-ray machines that scan carry-on bags.
The more frequent tests would measure not only the alertness of
screeners but also the effectiveness of their training, as well as
measuring how long a shift can be before screeners start to lose
effectiveness, and how long the interval between training sessions
can be.

INDONESIA ELECTION RETURNS USHER IN A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT IN POWER  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Slow election returns left Indonesia in
suspense on Tuesday about the shape of its political future. But
whatever the outcome of Monday's vote, a fundamental shift in power
already seemed to be taking place: people were choosing their
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   It was Indonesia's first free election in four decades, and in
thousands of towns and villages around the country, voters defied
the wishes of the officials who had ordered their lives for
generations.
</P>
<P>
   A tiny number of election returns on Tuesday showed the ruling
party, Golkar, trailing, and the opposition party of Megawati
Sukarnoputri in the lead. While anecdotal evidence and assessments
of some party leaders indicated that Golkar might be heading for
defeat, election analysts said that the numbers were still too
small to be significant.
</P>
<P>
   Initial reports from Indonesian poll-watching groups indicated
that the voting had generally been free of manipulation and
intimidation, although the possibility of fraud in the tabulation
of votes remained.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the poll watchers said, Indonesians appeared
to be voting as they wished for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   What seemed to be changing _ hesitantly, tentatively _ was a
culture of subservience during President Suharto's 32 years in
power that had come to be known as ``A.B.S.,'' the Indonesian
initials for a phrase that translates roughly as, ``If it makes you
happy, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If Suharto said, `You do it like that,' OK, OK, I'll do
anything for you,'' said Yeni Gayatri, a personnel manager. ``For
32 years it worked. And now _ we open our eyes now. Oh, it was so
silly.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a realization that seemed to take hold across the country
on election day.
</P>
<P>
   People in the town of Buaran Indah, a bedroom community for
civil servants 20 miles west of Jakarta, had never seen anything
like it.
</P>
<P>
   Before the vote began at polling place No. 1, Pana Supena, the
local Golkar chief, ordered and pointed, and local residents
listened deferentially. Then they voted against him, 396 to 55.
</P>
<P>
   Supena seemed to shrink in his seat as the ballots were opened
and announced, one by one, to the whoops and cheers of his
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Onward!'' shouted a young man in an Einstein T-shirt each time
a vote was read for Mrs. Megawati's party, the Indonesian
Democratic Party of Struggle, which won the most votes here.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Before the votes were cast, a 70-year-old retired engineer named
Mulana refused even to hint at his preference. After Golkar's
defeat, he could not seem to stop talking. ``I was full of hope
that this would happen,'' he said. ``This day was for my children
and grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   Parno, 49, a clerk in the Justice Ministry, said he had cast a
vote against the ruling party simply to assert his independence.
``The way they used to pressure people has turned everybody off of
Golkar,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There were similar moments at polling places in downtown Jakarta
and in the rice-farming villages that surround it.
</P>
<P>
   In the village of Pakuhaji Kelapa, 25 miles west of Jakarta,
where the tart smoke of burning rice husks sweetened the air, the
Golkar poll watcher, Sainan, seemed at first to have more authority
than the election officials.
</P>
<P>
   But as the count was read, he hunched lower and lower over his
tally sheet and his right hand slid slowly across the page to hide
the shamefully small total.
</P>
<P>
   In the well-to-do Menteng district of Jakarta, where Suharto
himself voted on Monday, high-ranking officials and wealthy traders
turned against him en masse.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election is very special for us,'' said Lastry, 44, the
wife of a Foreign Ministry official, stepping carefully around
puddles from an early morning rain. ``Last time, we had to vote a
certain way because of my husband's government work. Now we can
choose any party we want.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But in a complicated process, Monday's vote will produce just
462 members of a 700-seat assembly that will choose the next
president later this year. The remainder of the seats will be
appointed rather than elected, and a long, unpredictable period of
coalition building, arm twisting and vote buying is expected.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-eight parties were on Monday's ballot, and both the
candidates and the voters had a jumble of agendas in this moment of
sudden political freedom. The votes against Golkar had similarly
varied roots, from economic hardship to democratic hopes to Islamic
idealism.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the voting seemed to express a shared desire for a
fresh start after a lifetime of repression under Suharto.
Anti-Golkar voters shared a common hope that is described here,
without further definition, as ``reform.''
</P>
<P>
   This was reason enough to vote against Golkar, said Johanes
Subandi, 51, a driver for the Justice Ministry who lives in Buaran
Indah. ``If we all voted the same way we did before,'' he said,
``it wouldn't be reform yet, would it.''

PARENTS URGE CONGRESS TO LIMIT STUDENT CREDIT CARD ISSUANCE. 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Filed in ``w'' and ``f'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Trisha Johnson said Tuesday that her daughter,
Mitzi Pool, might be alive today if she hadn't been bombarded with
credit card solicitations when she began her freshman year at the
University of Central Oklahoma in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Pool was able to obtain three credit cards without her mother's
permission and racked up $2,500 in debt during her first semester.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 1, 1997, Pool called her mother to explain that she was
deep in credit card debt and didn't know what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The $2,500 credit card debt does not sound like that much to
you or I, but for an 18-year-old trying to be an adult too fast,
$2,500 is devastating,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said she tried to assure her daughter that they would
figure out a way to pay the debt when she returned home to Enid,
Okla., for a weekend visit.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later Johnson received a call from police telling
her that Pool had committed suicide. Police found credit cards,
bills and a checkbook spread out over Pool's dorm-room bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The credit card companies target these young adults just like
the tobacco industries,'' Johnson said. ``They lure them in and
then they have them hooked.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and consumer groups want Congress to require credit card
companies to obtain a parent's permission before issuing credit
cards to students under 21, most of whom have little or no outside
income. Parental permission would not be required if the students
can show the credit card issuers that they are financially
independent of their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Such legislation may be considered when the Senate takes up a
bankruptcy reform bill later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The credit industry has worked to defeat similar legislation
last year. Visa U.S.A., a major credit card issuer, didn't take a
position on the proposal Tuesday but issued a statement that it is
working to educate young adults about responsible credit card use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Visa feels it is important that consumers learn to properly
manage their finances at an early age,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Brobeck, director of the Consumer Federation of America,
said many students are ill-equipped to handle credit card debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have never been financially independent, they have modest
incomes and they have not received adequate financial
information,'' he said. ``Yet as early as freshman orientation they
are bombarded with credit offers from issuers who frequently extend
thousands of dollars of unaffordable credit lines.''
</P>
<P>
   One such advertisement offered a Visa credit card to students
with this pitch: ``Free from parental rule at last. Now all you
need is money. Cha-Ching.''
</P>
<P>
   Brobeck said the credit lines all seem ``so affordable'' to
students who are told they only have to pay a minimum monthly
payment that is often as little as $10. The problem is with
interest rates that can be as high as 20 percent the amount of the
debt can quickly grow if only the minimum monthly payment is made.
</P>
<P>
   Janne O'Donnell, of Norman, Okla., also lost a child to what she
said is the ``aggressive marketing tactics used by credit card
companies that prey on kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Her son, Sean Moyer, had more than $10,000 in debt on 12 credit
cards before he committed suicide on Feb. 7, 1998, at age 22.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer earned a full academic scholarship to the University of
Texas at Dallas and worked at a part-time job earning $5.15 an hour
to pay for non-academic expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so bright about so many things but so stupid when it
came to managing his money,'' O'Donnell said of her son, who later
transferred to the University of Oklahoma. ``How those companies
can justify giving credit cards to a person making $5.15 an hour is
beyond me.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell also faults universities and colleges for allowing the
credit card companies to aggressively market credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't attend a college event without seeing credit card
booths giving students gifts for signing up,'' she said. ``The
University of Oklahoma's (Internet) web page allows a student to
sign up without asking how much money they make...(but) they ask
how many of the student's other credit cards they want to transfer
to the new card.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Manning, a sociology professor at Georgetown University
who has studied student credit-card use, said credit card firms
like Visa U.S.A. Inc., often sponsor various school activities. In
some cases a school receives a small percentage of students'
purchases when the school has a deal with a credit card issuer to
market a card with the school's name on it.
</P>
<P>
   Manning estimates that about 70 percent of college-age students
have credit cards. He explained that many students quickly run up
hundreds of dollars in debt on one card, then realize how easy it
is get other credit cards while making minimum payments on each
card, which only increases their indebtedness.
</P>
<P>
   According to Manning, if a person has $1,500 debt and pays $25 a
month at 19.8 percent interest, it would take 282 months.

   WASHINGTON _ Trisha Johnson said Tuesday that her daughter,
Mitzi Pool, might be alive today if she hadn't been bombarded with
credit card solicitations when she began her freshman year at the
University of Central Oklahoma in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Pool was able to obtain three credit cards without her mother's
permission and racked up $2,500 in debt during her first semester.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 1, 1997, Pool called her mother to explain that she was
deep in credit card debt and didn't know what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The $2,500 credit card debt does not sound like that much to
you or I, but for an 18-year-old trying to be an adult too fast,
$2,500 is devastating,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said she tried to assure her daughter that they would
figure out a way to pay the debt when she returned home to Enid,
Okla., for a weekend visit.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later Johnson received a call from police telling
her that Pool had committed suicide. Police found credit cards,
bills and a checkbook spread out over Pool's dorm-room bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The credit card companies target these young adults just like
the tobacco industries,'' Johnson said. ``They lure them in and
then they have them hooked.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and consumer groups want Congress to require credit card
companies to obtain a parent's permission before issuing credit
cards to students under 21, most of whom have little or no outside
income. Parental permission would not be required if the students
can show the credit card issuers that they are financially
independent of their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Such legislation may be considered when the Senate takes up a
bankruptcy reform bill later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The credit industry has worked to defeat similar legislation
last year. Visa U.S.A., a major credit card issuer, didn't take a
position on the proposal Tuesday but issued a statement that it is
working to educate young adults about responsible credit card use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Visa feels it is important that consumers learn to properly
manage their finances at an early age,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Brobeck, director of the Consumer Federation of America,
said many students are ill-equipped to handle credit card debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have never been financially independent, they have modest
incomes and they have not received adequate financial
information,'' he said. ``Yet as early as freshman orientation they
are bombarded with credit offers from issuers who frequently extend
thousands of dollars of unaffordable credit lines.''
</P>
<P>
   One such advertisement offered a Visa credit card to students
with this pitch: ``Free from parental rule at last. Now all you
need is money. Cha-Ching.''
</P>
<P>
   Brobeck said the credit lines all seem ``so affordable'' to
students who are told they only have to pay a minimum monthly
payment that is often as little as $10. The problem is with
interest rates that can be as high as 20 percent the amount of the
debt can quickly grow if only the minimum monthly payment is made.
</P>
<P>
   Janne O'Donnell, of Norman, Okla., also lost a child to what she
said is the ``aggressive marketing tactics used by credit card
companies that prey on kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Her son, Sean Moyer, had more than $10,000 in debt on 12 credit
cards before he committed suicide on Feb. 7, 1998, at age 22.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer earned a full academic scholarship to the University of
Texas at Dallas and worked at a part-time job earning $5.15 an hour
to pay for non-academic expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so bright about so many things but so stupid when it
came to managing his money,'' O'Donnell said of her son, who later
transferred to the University of Oklahoma. ``How those companies
can justify giving credit cards to a person making $5.15 an hour is
beyond me.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell also faults universities and colleges for allowing the
credit card companies to aggressively market credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't attend a college event without seeing credit card
booths giving students gifts for signing up,'' she said. ``The
University of Oklahoma's (Internet) web page allows a student to
sign up without asking how much money they make...(but) they ask
how many of the student's other credit cards they want to transfer
to the new card.''
</P>

IN SERBIAN HOLY LAND, FEARS OF AN AVENGING KLA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: FIXES dateline to Yugoslavia sted Serbia.) 
 (rm) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVO POLJE, Serbia _ This is the place where the Serbian
national consciousness was born in a noble slaughter, and the Serbs
of Kosovo Polje are both anxious and defiant. They are less
concerned about the imminent influx of NATO soldiers than about the
Kosovo Liberation Army and the Albanian capacity for revenge.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Serbs who may live in more isolated villages here in
Kosovo, these Serbs, only a few miles from the capital, Pristina,
are not ready to leave their homes and businesses and begin new
lives as refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is holy Serbian land,'' said Ljubisa Lazic, 53, a jovial
telephone inspector who suddenly turned serious. ``Our churches and
our graves are like a stop sign to us _ they don't let us leave
here. If we did, we would be damned anywhere in the world we go,
both us and our children.''
</P>
<P>
   His friend, Petar Rapajic, scoffs at such fervor, blaming the
disaster of Kosovo on bad leadership in Belgrade, Washington and
London that allowed the rise of the KLA. But he also acknowledges
that many Serbs have behaved criminally here in this war against
the Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Rapajic has no intention of leaving Kosovo, he said, but in the
last few days other Serbs have begun to depart. On Tuesday, driving
south from Belgrade, numerous Serbian cars, with belongings packed
on their roofs, were passed heading north toward central Serbia.
There were also at least 10 large trucks and buses filled with
soldiers and military equipment also leaving Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serbs are afraid, and for good reason,'' Rapajic said. ``There
are a lot of burned houses and destroyed lives, and they fear
revenge. They did a lot of bad things to the Albanians that
shouldn't have been done _ killings and burnings _ and they're
afraid that the KLA will appear.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he felt about the Serbian army and police withdrawing
from Kosovo, he said: ``The problem isn't that they are leaving.
The problem is if the KLA comes in. People aren't afraid of NATO or
the United Nations, but of the KLA. And they're not sure that the
foreigners will protect them or fight the KLA. After all, NATO
fought for the KLA.''
</P>
<P>
   The defining myth of Serbian statehood is here in this region,
on Kosovo Polje, the field of blackbirds, where the Serbs lost
nobly to the Turks 610 years ago this month. The Serbian commander,
Prince Lazar, is revered as a saint, but few here are willing to
give the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, that much
reverence.
</P>
<P>
   A young woman, a Serb who would not give her name, said she
would leave Kosovo. She was very anxious about the future, and
furious about this defeat. ``I will kill him,'' she said softly and
slowly, referring to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that his policies had produced Serbian refugees before,
from Bosnia and Croatia, she said: ``It doesn't matter. I will kill
him for all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rapajic, 47, owns four auto service stores and rents another
here. He lives in Devet-Jugovica, a mixed Serbian-Albanian village
8 miles north of Pristina, and he described matter-of-factly how
Serbian paramilitary police burned Albanian houses, sometimes
helped by Serbian neighbors, and how the KLA had killed a man and
his two sons in front of their house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have traumas,'' he said. ``It can't be that the KLA comes to
a house and murders a family, and Serbs can't burn and steal and
loot. God gave no one the right to do these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Rapajic said that the Albanians of his village had fled out of
fear, but that when he attempted to stop the burning of their empty
homes, he was nearly shot by the police. ``They said I was a
traitor to my people and they pointed their guns at me,'' he said.
``So I stepped back.'' It may have been brave, he acknowledged.
``But I don't know how clever it was. But I built my house myself,
and I felt on my skin what it is to build a house.''
</P>
<P>
   When he kept a car for an Albanian friend who fled, Rapajic was
interrogated by 20 military policemen who searched his house.
``They wanted to know how many Albanians I know, how I know them,
why I drove them around,'' he said. ``They asked me for a satellite
telephone and almost said I was working against the state.''
</P>
<P>
   He stopped, laughing. ``I don't even know what a satellite
telephone looks like.''
</P>
<P>
   The police took the car, which they insisted was stolen.
</P>
<P>
   But Rapajic also believes that NATO's decision to bomb set off
the worst of the catastrophe, enraging Serbs against the Albanians
and giving them the pretext for terrible crimes. And this solution,
he says, ``won't solve the problem of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   That is rooted in competing claims to the land, he said, ``and
there is a lot of hatred now.'' Like many Serbs, he would prefer to
divide Kosovo and give the Albanians their own territory, but he
acknowledges that it may be too late for that.
</P>
<P>
   Dragisa Nikolic is prepared to keep fighting. Now 43, he was
mobilized into the army and was wounded May 19 by a KLA sniper near
Grabovac, in the Cicavica mountains only 15 miles northwest of
Pristina. Three more members of his 11-man patrol were wounded in
the same KLA ambush.
</P>
<P>
   Only Monday, he said, a friend of his from here, Marko Vujacic,
37, with three children, was killed, shot in the head by a sniper
100 yards from where Nikolic was wounded.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, driving toward the Macedonian border town of Djeneral
Jankovic, an Israeli journalist, Ron Ben-Yishai of Yediot Aharonot,
and a Serbian driver, Ivan Cvejic, were wounded near Kacanik when
their car was fired upon by snipers.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The KLA is still a big problem,'' Nikolic said, his arm in a
sling and his dogtag poking out over his black polo shirt. ``I'll
fight them again, and I won't leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he believe that NATO forces will demilitarize the KLA?
``NATO will demilitarize us, not the KLA,'' he said. ``NATO works
for them.'' But he said he would not try to fight the peacekeeping
forces. ``Our struggle is not with them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His friend, Boza Tadic, says he will also stay and take his
chance. He is one of the hundreds of thousands of Serbs ethnically
purged from Croatia in 1995 and resettled in Kosovo. ``So where do
I go now?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Two young men, Aleksandar Zivic, 18, and Milan Stanovic, 17,
said they were very nervous, and so were their parents, who talk a
lot about leaving. Zivic's father and Stanovic's father and brother
have been mobilized and are ``in the field'' with the army, and the
young men are very worried about them, too, as the bombing campaign
continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life might become impossible here,'' Zivic said. Why?
``Because the Albanians will be on top.'' And what might they do?
Stanovic said: ``Maybe worse things than what we did to them.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   As the waiter at Babbo in New York's Greenwich Village set a
plate of sea bass before us, he offered a little extra olive oil,
crisscrossing the fillets with a thin and aromatic stream of
greenish gold. When I asked what oil this very Italian restaurant
was pouring, the waiter replied, ``Our house oil is DaVero, from
California.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident and the answer are a clear indication of just how
far California olive oils have come in the last 10 years. A few
brands not only can stand up to the best that Italy exports, in the
judgment of discerning buyers in the United States, but also
command such dazzling prices that they are best used as a
condiment, like that dainty drizzle over fish.
</P>
<P>
   DaVero Dry Creek Valley, for instance, beat out the competition
in a blind tasting in Italy in 1997. The oil, from Sonoma County,
is fruity, robust and peppery in the Tuscan style, with delightful
hints of artichoke sweetness. Quantities are limited, and a
12.7-ounce bottle is about $22 ($66 a liter). It is sold mainly in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Even the California oils sold in bulk and bottled under private
labels for Fairway and Eli's Manhattan have improved and offer good
value for those reluctant to spend more than $10 on a liter of oil
destined for the saute pan. Fairway's is bold and grassy, as good
as many imports in the same price range. Eli's, a warmer oil, is
organic.
</P>
<P>
   But the best California oils are generally like high-end Tuscan
estate oils, for the porcini and truffle set. You'll find them in
fancy food shops and mail order catalogs, but not in supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   ``My oil costs about $70 a gallon to make, before it's
bottled,'' said Ridgely Evers, a successful Internet entrepreneur,
who has invested millions to make DaVero over the last 11 years and
now has 22 acres planted with 4,500 trees. ``And that's not even
taking my capital investment and the cost of the land into
account.''
</P>
<P>
   Evers, who produces 500 cases a year, said that he would like to
charge $30 a bottle for DaVero but that $20 is all the market will
bear. ``And remember that, if someone likes your oil, it's not like
wine,'' he added. ``They may buy a bottle, but they're not going to
run out and buy a case.''
</P>
<P>
   The wine analogy is apt in other ways, though, not least because
many of the better oils carry winery names. Just as the earliest
California wines were often destined for jugs, the first olive oils
were produced in bulk.
</P>
<P>
   Now, many of the oils with the most cachet are being pressed
from fruit varietals, like leccino and frantoio, recently imported
from Italy; not from California's mission, manzanillo, sevillano
and ascolano trees. Evers' sideline is selling Italian olive trees.
And like the early stars of the wine industry, these oils are being
made in the European style, with Italian equipment and, often,
Italian advisers.
</P>
<P>
   They are meant to compete at the high end of the market. It has
taken the oil producers far less time than it did winemakers to
start charging top dollar. Whether the prices, like $40 a liter,
are justified remains to be seen, but for now, sales are up 18
percent this year over last.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was consumers' appreciation of high-quality extra
virgin European olive oils that gave California producers the
opportunity to jump in and try something better than they had been
making for decades. Now, even the olive trees that have been a
fixture of the California landscape for centuries are earning new
respect.
</P>
<P>
   Olive trees were first planted on the West Coast more than 200
years ago by Spanish missionaries. By the end of the 19th century,
farmers took over where the missions left off, and there was a boom
in olive plantings, with much of the crop pressed for rough-edged
oil that was sold to waves of new immigrants from Italy. (One
exception was Sciabica, a company in Modesto in the Central Valley,
which has been making creditable varietal oils since the
mid-1930s.)
</P>
<P>
   Over time the industry declined, partly because of competition
from cheaper imports but mainly because of the demand for canned
olives, mostly the ``ripe black'' kind. More than 95 percent of the
olives harvested in California go to canneries, which are now
suffering because of cheaper imports from Morocco and Spain. As a
result, growers have started thinking about oil again.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent harvest (1998-99), California produced
321,000 gallons of extra virgin quality oil (a figure for total
olive oil production is not compiled), a mere droplet compared with
the 29 million gallons of virgin olive oil, including extra virgin,
imported last year into the United States. But production is
growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be a fever about olive oil out here now,'' said
Nan McEvoy, the owner of McEvoy of Marin near Petaluma, which has
more than 12,000 Italian trees growing on 112 acres and has been
making oil since 1996. ``It's still the beginning, but it's taking
off the way wine took off.''
</P>
<P>
   The California Olive Oil Council, which was founded in 1992 and
now has nearly 300 members, has a panel of tasters trained by
European experts that has started certifying oils. All are
cold-pressed, meaning no heat is used to extract them, and low-acid
extra virgin quality. This year, the number of oils carrying the
council's seal is expected to climb to 50.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even more than with wine, it's a struggle for these oils
to find a toehold in a marketplace awash in imports, many of them
first rate and reasonably priced, like the good Spanish and Greek
oils that have been turning up lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of those California oils are collectors' oils, museum
oils,'' said Steven Jenkins, an owner of Fairway. ``There's so much
good European oil out there, no one should have to pay $40 a liter.
I carried a wonderful California oil, Calaveras, and at $15 a liter
I couldn't give it away.'' Fairway buys a decent California oil in
bulk and sells about 175 gallons of it a week at $8.99 a liter.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many of the new oils bear the labels of wineries that decided to
turn the trees on their land into cash, including Wente, Charles
Krug, Niebaum-Coppola, Iron Horse, Harrison and B.R. Cohn. Lila
Jaeger, an owner of Jaeger Vineyards, began making oil in the
mid-1980s instead of letting the olives fall to the ground and rot.
And today the elegantly fruity oil that bears her name is among the
best.
</P>
<P>
   The Robert Mondavi Winery in Oakville, in the Napa Valley, has
started planting olive trees, about 1,000, on land that isn't
suitable for growing grapes, said Tim Mondavi, the managing
director of the winery. Helping this new enterprise is Frescobaldi,
the maker of Laudemio, one of the best Tuscan oils, and Mondavi's
partner in a joint wine venture. It takes five years for new trees
to yield olives suitable for oil.
</P>
<P>
   But the wineries are only part of the olive oil boom. One major
operation, Calio Groves in Berkeley, presses, blends and bottles
four labels, including EVO, Olio Santo and Stutz.
</P>
<P>
   About two and a half years ago, Ed Stolman, who made Dove Bars a
national brand before selling it to M&AMP;M/Mars, started the Olive
Press in Glen Ellen, a cooperative patterned after similar
community presses in Europe. The center pressed 500 tons of olives
last year (somewhat less this year because the harvest was not as
good) and makes the oils for Lila Jaeger, Iron Horse and B.R. Cohn,
as well as for its own label. And it produces the organic olive
oils sold under the Spectrum label.
</P>
<P>
   The Olive Press also makes oil for individuals who bring in
buckets of olives harvested from their backyards. Stolman has even
started a program of helping the missions re-establish their olive
groves and make oil to sell in their gift shops.
</P>
<P>
   The Olive Press is one of at least 10 active olive mills in the
state. Visitors to the Olive Press can taste an array of oils and,
during the harvest, which usually begins in late November, can
watch the state-of-the-art Italian press, called a hammermill,
crush the olives and extract the oil in a continuous process.
</P>
<P>
   A few others, including McEvoy and Frantoio in Mill Valley, use
a traditional stone crusher to pulverize the olives before pressing
them to release the oil, and they believe this old-fashioned method
is best. It's one of several controversies.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest debate is whether the traditional table olives like
mission can be used to make first-rate oil, or whether European oil
varieties are necessary. Evers, Ms. McEvoy and others insist not
only on Italian oil olives, but also on a Tuscan style of oil that
is grassy, peppery and very green.
</P>
<P>
   They have yet to carry the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest fallacies we have to address is that you
need Italian olives to make oil,'' said Darrell Corti, an olive oil
expert and an owner of Corti Brothers, a fancy food shop in
Sacramento. ``Our microclimates are different, and maybe we'd do
better with Greek or Spanish olives. We have to make our oil, not
theirs, and there are already some terrific oils being made from
varieties like mission. A lot of this is just marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   Marketing put chardonnay on the map and in every glass. Can it
put California olive oil in every salad? ``California has to focus
on competing with the better oils,'' Evers said. ``I'll never
encourage anyone to go into this, but I'm thrilled with how far
we've come.''

 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a blinding hot day in 1908, Gertrude Stein and
Alice B. Toklas climbed a hill above the Italian town of Fiesole,
where both were spending the summer. There was tension in the air,
a powerful attraction; there were unanswered questions. Stopping in
the heat, the two had a conversation. In the onrush of feelings, in
the way of people newly in love who want to make a clean break from
the past, they told each other about the people they had loved
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't Nelly and Lilly love you?'' Stein asked, referring to
two of Toklas' intimate friends. Toklas' answer is unknown, but
evidently it was satisfactory because Stein asked Toklas to marry
her. Thus began a relationship that was to endure for 38 years,
with Stein referring to herself as ``husband'' and to Toklas as
``wife.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't Nelly and Lilly Love you?'' The question Stein asked
that day runs like a refrain _ allusive, insistent _ through
``Gertrude and Alice: A Likeness to Loving,'' a new play about the
women that opens Wednesday night at the Signature Theater here.
</P>
<P>
   The play, directed by Anne Bogart, is a production of the
Foundry Theater, and it gives perhaps the most intimate look yet at
a friendship that was sensual, tempestuous and supremely enabling,
with Toklas as Stein's lover, editor, secretary, housekeeper and
cook. It stars Lola Pashalinski as Stein and Linda Chapman as
Toklas.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pashalinski and Ms. Chapman also created the play, from the
stream of references to the relationship in Stein's published and
unpublished writings. They were assisted by a prominent Stein
scholar, Ulla Dydo, with credit also going to Bill Rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Likeness to Loving'' is but one sign of Stein's enduring
influence as a writer who broke apart the language _ out of a
passion, she wrote in ``The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas,''
``for exactitude in the description of inner and outer reality.''
Stein, who was born 125 years ago, saw herself as nothing less than
one of the creators of 20th-century art and literature. And Paris
was at the center of that genesis. At her home at 27 Rue de
Fleurus, Stein nourished Picasso, Juan Gris, Matisse, Hemingway,
Sherwood Anderson, F. Scott Fitzgerald and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us balk at her soporific rigmaroles, her echolaliac
incantations, her half-witted sounding catalogs of numbers,''
Edmund Wilson wrote in ``Axel's Castle'' in 1931. Yet ``we are
always aware of her presence in the background of contemporary
literature.''
</P>
<P>
   Today Stein is seen as a precursor of postmodernism and as a
feminist icon. Last year two large volumes of Stein's writings,
edited by Catharine Stimpson, were published by the Library of
America. And in February a scholarly conference at Washington
University in St. Louis assessed her influence on avant-garde
fiction, poetry and film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serious criticism about Stein is expanding at a great rate,''
Ms. Stimpson said. ``She is a pop icon, a reference when people
want to talk about repetition, Paris and the bohemian life, and
increasingly, when you want to talk about alternate ways of
loving.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein's legacy can be felt in the work of Language poets like
Lyn Hejinian, Bernadette Mayer, Leslie Scalapino and Clark
Coolidge, poets as interested in language itself as in the content
of poetry. Stein has had a powerful effect, too, on writers like
Donald Barthelme and William Gass who have questioned the
fundamental forms of fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``She taught me more than any other writer,'' Gass said. He
offered a Stein sentence as an example: ``It looked like a garden,
but he had hurt himself by accident.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's skewing syntax to open up what's going on in the
sentence,'' Gass said. ``She arranged language spatially rather
than temporally.'' She played with the book form. For instance, she
would write two sentences and call that a volume, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had this sense of the phenomenon of reading, that reading
is interrupted, recursive, looping all the time,'' Gass said. He
added that Stein had influenced his novel ``The Tunnel,'' with its
streams of similar scenes, each one slightly rewritten and
different from the last.
</P>
<P>
   The new play takes on the nonlinear form of Stein's own writing.
Like Stein and Toklas, the stars, Ms. Pashalinski, 63, and Ms.
Chapman, 48, are ``partners in life,'' Ms. Chapman said. They have
been together 19 years and are fixtures of downtown theater. Ms.
Pashalinski was a founding member with Charles Ludlam of the
Ridiculous Theatrical Company. Ms. Chapman was an associate of the
Wooster Group and is associate artistic director of the New York
Theater Workshop.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the lives of Ms. Pashalinski and Ms. Chapman
mirror those of Stein and Toklas. They met when each was breaking
away from an old existence. Ms. Pashalinski had just left the
Ridiculous Theatrical Company. ``I had a need to strike out on my
own,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chapman had come to New York from Spokane, Wash., to be an
actor, but hated the life of the commercial theater. ``I was a
little lost,'' she said. She became general manager of the Theater
for a New City. ``I was starting to reinvent myself,'' Ms. Chapman
said. She was also married to a man. ``Lola was very suspicious of
me. It took a while to win her trust.''
</P>
<P>
   The relationship grew gradually, ``while we were having a lot of
laughs,'' Ms. Pashalinski said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``our relationship is much more free-form than theirs,''
Ms. Chapman said, referring to Stein and Toklas. ``They played
fairly rigid roles'' _ and not without irony, she said. In the
play, ``I reflect that you reflect about me,'' Stein says to
Toklas, and Toklas responds: ``I reflect what you reflect about
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The play begins with their meeting in Paris, where Stein was
living with her overbearing brother Leo, who disdained her writing.
In an interview that has been incorporated into the play, Toklas
remembered: ``Gertrude had a certain physical beauty and enormous
power. Definitely. She sat there and said nothing _as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Gertrude Stein's initial impression of Toklas was less
complimentary. ``The whole of her is made up of every conceivable
kind of weakness, crookedness,'' she says in the play, based on a
passage in an unpublished notebook. ``Every thing induces
crookedness, the practical sense, the melodramatic imagination, the
passion for vulgar beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Toklas moved in, and eventually Stein's brother moved out.
Toklas' belief in Stein's talent was uncompromising. She rose early
to type Stein's writing while Stein slept late. ``Sweet pinky,''
Toklas says, in words from the margin of one of Stein's
manuscripts, ``you made lots of literature last night, didn't
you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of time to be a genius; you have to sit around
so much doing nothing,'' Stein said. When famous men visited,
Toklas entertained their wives so Stein could talk to the other
geniuses.
</P>
<P>
   Stein's first published book, ``Three Lives,'' came out in 1909.
But her writing was nearly impossible to publish. It took 17 years
to publish ``The Making of Americans: Being a History of a Family's
Progress'' (1925), her attempt to tell the story of the human race.
And in 1914 she herself paid for the publication of ``Tender
Buttons: Objects, Food, Rooms,'' essentially ``cubist'' writing
about familiar objects.
</P>
<P>
   At the outbreak of World War I, Stein and Toklas went to
Majorca, where they were truly alone for the first time. ``My wife
is my life is my life is my wife,'' Stein says in the play. In her
writing, Stein used the image of a cow to talk about their
relationship. ``Have a cow, now, not now but later,'' Stein says in
``A Likeness to Loving.'' ``Later means sooner and sooner means
better and better means fuller.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war, the writers whom Stein and Toklas had nurtured
began to achieve success. But they were not helping Stein. ``The
need for recognition for both had gotten to a critical mass,'' Ms.
Pashalinski said. Stein and Toklas turned them away. Virgil
Thomson, who wrote the music for the Stein operas ``Four Saints in
Three Acts'' and ``The Mother of Us All,'' was dismissed with a
note: ``Miss Stein declines further acquaintance with Thomson,''
Stein declares in the play.
</P>
<P>
   In 1932 came a crisis. Toklas discovered an unpublished
manuscript of Stein's first novel, ``QED,'' which told of an affair
with a woman named May Bookstaver before Stein met Toklas. Toklas
confronted Stein in a frenzy of jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   As presented in the play, Stein, in a gesture of reconciliation,
wrote ``The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas.'' In the book,
published in 1933, Stein assumes Toklas' voice to tell her own
story. The autobiography ``enables Ms. Stein to write about herself
while pretending she is someone clearly devoted to herself,'' the
critic Robert Cantwell wrote. It was the easiest of Stein's books
to comprehend, her only best seller.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, after the success of ``Four Saints in Three
Acts,'' Stein and Toklas toured the United States and were received
as the celebrities they had always wanted to be _ or wanted Stein
to be. ``Gertrude was one of the early inventors of self-promotion
as we know it today,'' Ms. Chapman said. ``She knew how to use the
media before it was commonly done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Likeness to Loving'' draws to a close with words from a
Stein book, ``Everybody's Autobiography'': ``And then gradually it
was ending and we went out and on to the stage, and there where I
never had been with everything in front all dark and we bowing and
all of them coming and going and bowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the victory was Pyrrhic. ``She became famous, but not for
her real writing,'' Ms. Pashalinski said. ``And she never went back
to that kind of experimental writing again.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein died in 1946. Toklas lived until 1967, vigilantly guarding
Stein's legacy, and is buried beside Stein in Pere Lachaise
Cemetery in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was everything, it was all over and we went back to sit
down,'' Stein says at the end of the play. ``I guess it was a great
success.''

BELGIUM'S FOOD SCANDAL IS LATEST IN A LITANY OF WOES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The chicken definitely came first in
Belgium, then the egg _ followed by pork, veal, beef, and now even
milk, cheese and butter.
</P>
<P>
   Belgians are having trouble finding any of these things on the
market unless they are imported. Millions of dollars' worth of
Belgian-produced meat and dairy products are being sent to
incinerators in a widening crisis caused by the unexplained
contamination of animal feed by poisonous dioxin chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   In a country with more Michelin-starred restaurants per capita
than France, it is hard to imagine a calamity that would strike
harder at the national solar plexus, except possibly a revelation
that Belgium's famous beer was being watered down.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene's coalition
government in a national election on Sunday is now uncertain, with
a fifth of voters indicating in surveys that the scandal will
affect their decisions at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Politics aside, supermarket meat and poultry shelves are empty,
fish prices are soaring, restaurant menus are as misleading as they
used to be in the Soviet Union, where ``there isn't any'' seemed to
be the national dish. Pity the poor gourmand, who can't even fall
back on mussels, because they're out of season now.
</P>
<P>
   In Luc Selicq's butcher shop, the Boucherie-Charcuterie Paul off
the famous Grand' Place in Brussels, it was slim pickings on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got good American horse meat, a lot better than the
Argentine stuff I used to sell,'' Selicq said on Tuesday morning,
his display cases half empty for lack of anything edible to put in
them. ``We can still sell lamb, and beef when we can get it from
other countries, but all I know is what I hear on the radio _ we
have no official information from the government at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Bennie, a regular customer at Paul's, took a couple of
beefsteaks from Ireland, and hazarded a veal cutlet that Selicq
said he could still sell because it had been certified free of
dioxin. ``Stay away from the fat,'' he cautioned anyway, ``because
that's where any dioxin would be concentrated.''
</P>
<P>
   How the dioxin got into chicken and animal feed is under police
investigation. The suspicion is that this is one more in a
never-ending series of malfeasances, part of the cronyism,
corruption and Civil Service incompetence that have been almost a
way of life in Belgium for most of the last 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The father and son owners of the company to whose products the
problem was first traced, Jean and Lucien Verkest of the
agricultural center of Deinze, have been in preventive detention
since last week. They are suspected of having knowingly fabricated
or bought from Dutch suppliers feed grain mixed with cheap,
second-hand oil or fat that turned out to be contaminated with
dioxin. The tainted feed was sold to 1,400 producers in this
country and others in France and the Netherlands, authorities
believe.
</P>
<P>
   The Verkests' lawyers deny the accusations, but Belgian
agricultural inspectors are also being faulted for not checking
feed more closely. And authorities of the 15-nation European Union,
which is based in Brussels, wonder why it took two months for the
Belgian authorities to inform them about the problem once they
finally did discover it, in March.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union countries have now banned the export of most
major food products from Belgium, including things like mayonnaise,
offering to lift the ban if the Belgians can provide them with a
list of producers they can certify as being free of dioxin
contamination.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the government led by Dehaene, a Christian Democrat from
the Flemish-speaking northern part of the country, has been unable
to provide one. But the government said on Tuesday that it would do
so in a couple of days, and, in the meantime, let cleared items go
back on the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion has caused hundreds of millions of dollars in
agricultural losses that will probably have to be footed by Belgian
and European taxpayers. The United States and some Asian countries
have banned agricultural products from all over Europe as a
precaution.
</P>
<P>
   European officials are furious with the Belgians, accusing the
government of informing the rest of the Continent about the problem
only two months after it was first discovered by a Health Ministry
veterinarian in March. The ministers of health and agriculture
resigned early this month. This week, Dehaene, 59 and prime
minister for seven years, described the crisis as the most serious
of his long political career.
</P>
<P>
   But Belgium, a creation of 19th-century European
balance-of-power politics that the French historian Jules Michelet
said never was a true nation and never would be, has also been in
crisis in recent years, demoralized by demonstrations of
incompetence by other national institutions like the police.
</P>
<P>
   Three hundred thousand people demonstrated in the streets of
Brussels in late 1996 demanding change after disclosures that
police incompetence and, many people suspected, corruption had
allowed a pedophile serial killer, Marc Dutroux, to escape arrest
until after he had killed five little girls.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of last year, three former government ministers,
including Willy Claes, who had been secretary-general of NATO, were
convicted of having taken bribes from an Italian helicopter
company, Agosta, and the French aviation giant, Dassault, in
Belgian military contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Belgium seems less one nation today than ever. The 5.9 million
people of Flanders, the increasingly prosperous and self-assertive
northern part of the country where the language is close to Dutch,
feel they have little in common with the 3.3 million people of
Wallonia, the French-speaking southern half of the country that was
an industrial dynamo a century ago but is now a rust belt. Nearly a
million more people live in Brussels, historically Flemish
territory but now populated mostly by French-speakers.
</P>
<P>
   If Flemings and Walloons ever took to using guns against each
other, in fact, Belgium could fall into the kind of violence that
has torn apart Bosnia or Kosovo, a sobering realization that has
dampened separatist passions in the election campaign. They do
share an aversion to violence, however, along with a love of good
food, but that looks unlikely to be satisfied for a while yet.

A TIME FOR CALM IN IRELAND AND A NEW VIEW OF FRIEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ After 26 years of neglect, the Abbey Theater
is enthusiastically reviving Brian Friel's most political play,
``The Freedom of the City,'' set in the sectarian warfare of
contemporary Northern Ireland. The play has been well received by
audiences and critics in a Friel festival at the Abbey and will
move to the Lincoln Center Festival in New York on July 7 for a
brief run.
</P>
<P>
   Its long absence has been attributed to its bluntness at a time
when violence was raging between majority Protestants and minority
Roman Catholics in the British province and the Irish and British
governments were trying, and failing, to make peace. The play had
brief runs in Dublin and London in 1973 and on Broadway in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   The Abbey, Ireland's heavily subsidized national theater, was
reluctant to put on ``Freedom'' because it was perceived by some
critics as an exercise in Britain-bashing and because Dublin
audiences preferred not to dwell on the killing in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Friel, 70, a Roman Catholic born in Northern Ireland, now lives
in County Donegal near the border with Northern Ireland. He wrote
``Freedom'' in 1973, a year after the British army shot and killed
14 Roman Catholics at a civil rights demonstration in Londonderry
in what became known as Bloody Sunday. A British inquiry exonerated
the soldiers and suggested that the demonstrators were terrorists
linked to the Irish Republican Army. Decades later the British
government conceded that the demonstrators were innocent and had
not attacked the army, but no action was taken against the
soldiers. A new investigation is under way, partly as a result of
the peace effort that is moving forward in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Mason, 48, the Abbey's artistic director, and Conall
Morrison, the director of ``Freedom,'' say that the play also
reveals a neglected aspect of Friel, who is widely considered
Ireland's best living playwright. For decades, they said in
interviews, Friel has been favorably compared to Chekhov and
Pirandello. ``But there's also a political Friel who knows how to
use the theater as politically as Bertolt Brecht,'' said Mason, who
is leaving his job at the Abbey at the end of the year. ``He has a
range beyond his Chekhovian aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrison, 33, who grew up in a Roman Catholic family in Northern
Ireland and is a candidate to succeed Mason, said that ``Freedom''
was ``not remotely'' an anti-British diatribe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It blows a hole the size of Manhattan in the perceived image
of Brian Friel'' as a writer whose work must be filtered through
that of Chekhov, Pirandello or even Brecht,'' Morrison said,
adding: ``He's Brian Friel. He's his own genre.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is political with a small p, Morrison said of ``Freedom.''
In the play, three innocent demonstrators are shot by British
soldiers who are absolved through an inquiry in which participants
refer to the dead as terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wonder of the play is that while it feels like a broad
Brechtian flag-waving piece, it is actually a very astute,
insightful, very detailed examination of the nature of
individuality,'' Morrison said. Individuals get ignored or abused
or destroyed by the state, by the so-called collective will, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a superb examination of the concept of truth,'' he
continued. ``How so many people will have so many versions of the
same story, which they believe to be wholly objective, wholly
moral, wholly truthful.''
</P>
<P>
   In the play, events are manipulated by Roman Catholic
nationalists, a British judge, an Irish reporter and a priest, each
with his own ideological ax to grind.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper photographs of the real Bloody Sunday are blown up on
a screen behind the stage, and there are convincingly violent
skirmishes between the army and the demonstrators. There is dark
humor in the chat of the demonstrators as they sit in the mayor's
ornate office and drink his liquor, trying to avoid the line of
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Their heavy Ulster accents will be tempered for the American
audience. Morrison, who has also written plays set amid the
violence of Northern Ireland, recalled watching the IRA recruit his
school friends, with some of them ending up in jail or in coffins.
He was never tempted to join, he said, and once considered the IRA
``a bunch of madmen.'' Later he concluded that the violence had
roots in Irish history and English colonialism. He is a strong
supporter of John Hume, the mainstream Roman Catholic head of the
Social Democratic and Labor Party in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison has been commissioned to make a play out of Joseph
Conrad's novel ``Under Western Eyes,'' in which he will introduce a
Unabomber character to the plot. The possibility of becoming
artistic director of the Abbey was attractive, partly because ``it
would be an excellent excuse not to write,'' he said. ``Writing is
hard. Directing is an easier task. I read so many scripts by people
who have nothing to say. I do not want to add to the slush pile.''
</P>
<P>
   The best advice he has received on writing, he said, came 16
years ago after he sent a script to Friel, who is married to
Morrison's father's sister, Anne. ``He didn't encourage me, but he
was very polite,'' Morrison said. ``He wrote a list of principles
of writing. Now I can't find the letter, but I remember one phrase:
Don't tell me, show me.''  &QL;

 &HT;    IMMINENT RETURN OF KOSOVARS PUTS RELIEF AGENCIES IN HOT PLANNING
MODE
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-STRIKES-0609.

   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ As thousands of tons of food sit waiting to
be loaded onto trucks bound for Kosovo, the aid workers who will
take it are laying plans first for how to find and feed the
half-million Kosovar Albanians believed to be still hiding in the
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Then they will have to care for the more than 800,000 refugees
who want to go back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're assuming the worst,'' said Abby Spring of the U.N. World
Food Programme (WFP), speaking of internally displaced families.
``People have been foraging around for food for weeks. As each day
goes by, their condition is worsening.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why Sunday's collapse of negotiations that would mandate
immediate Yugoslav troop withdrawal from Kosovo and finally the
return of the refugees was such a setback to humanitarian agencies
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were ready to go in,'' said Nancy Shalala, who works with
Catholic Relief Services. ``It was demoralizing.''
</P>
<P>
   A morale-booster for humanitarian workers as well as refugees
may be a visit later this week by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, especially if a deal finally has been struck between NATO
and Yugoslavia. While her visit drops a heavy logistical burden on
groups already deep in work, it also may energize them for the hard
task ahead.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting the emergency needs of outgoing Kosovar refugees
who surged across the borders here and in Albania, now the world's
relief organizations are trying to plan strategies to help those
who never made it out, as well as get the refugees back home
without starving.
</P>
<P>
   That may not be so easy in a territory the size of Connecticut
where unknown numbers of homes have been burned, means of
livelihood trashed, and two-thirds of the fields never planted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no pesticides or fertilizers, no harvest this
year,'' Spring said. ``There's no farm equipment. The livestock has
been killed or stolen or eaten.''
</P>
<P>
   There also are fears about landmines left by retreating Serb-led
Yugoslav troops and potential booby traps for returning Kosovars,
such as explosives left in homes or poison in wells.
</P>
<P>
   At least, aid workers have some time to get ready for a change.
</P>
<P>
   So groups like Catholic Relief Services are amassing food and
trucks and drivers, and their leaders are picking the areas where
they believe the most vulnerable people will be found.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala said the Catholic agency is ready to supply preliminary
aid even before a master plan by the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees kicks into gear.
</P>
<P>
   That plan divides Kosovo into regions and assigns a
non-governmental organization to run each sector, much as refugee
camps have been run here and in Albania. It also parallels the
tentative military scheme dividing Kosovo into five areas, putting
each area under peacekeeping troops of a different nation.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic Relief has 40 trucks ready to roll, and the WFP has
about as many. The latter also plans helicopter and truck rescue
units to search for displaced people who fled their homes under
attack or fear of it, and have been living in the rough.
</P>
<P>
   Both agencies expect to be among the vanguard, once NATO troops
say the roads are safe to travel. They anticipate that could be as
soon as a day or two after peacekeeping troops arrive, and they
hope well before the refugees head back.
</P>
<P>
   The food agency expects to send in mobile warehouses and even
mobile bakeries that have their own source of power and can start
putting out fresh bread within 72 hours of arrival.
</P>
<P>
   The WFP hopes that before each refugee family crosses back over
the border into Kosovo it will be handed enough food to live on
until the family makes it home. That means enough food for one to
three days, Spring said.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the agency has enough food stocked in the region
to feed both the total number of refugees and internally displaced
persons for two weeks. Spring said WFP's target is having 1,000
metric tons of food each day available inside Kosovo to feed 1.5
million people.

 &HT;    19 FORMER SENATORS ENDORSE GORE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT MONTGOMERY

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign
collected endorsements Tuesday from an array of retired Democratic
senators.
</P>
<P>
   In a basement ballroom at the posh Mayflower Renaissance Hotel,
the group of 10 former senators jovially confronted perceptions of
Gore as stiff and bland in an endorsement rally that focused on
reversing the negative implications of that image rather than
disputing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many things that happen in public life that are dramatic are
not good governance,'' said former Sen. Mike Gravel of Alaska. ``Al
Gore is very competent.''
</P>
<P>
   Howell Heflin of Alabama, who supported Gore's 1988 presidential
bid, said that while the ``elitist media'' has branded Gore as
wooden, that characterization isn't entirely bad since it conveys
stability and strength. And he said Gore will be plenty colorful
when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out he is a terrific campaigner,'' boomed Heflin,
``and don't sell him short on hitting the campaign trail and
getting people to vote for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen former senators endorsed the Gore campaign Tuesday,
though only half made it to the Washington event. Those who did
stressed Gore's experience as a former member of the House and
Senate, arguing, as Ohio's Howard Metzenbaum did, that ``there is
no person better trained to be president.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore faces a primary challenge by another former senator, Bill
Bradley of New Jersey, but the Mayflower gathering seemed targeted
at Gore's standing in the general election, where polls say he
would be an underdog to the Republican's front-running candidate,
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the debates come, you'll see the difference'' between
Gore and his opponents, said Wendell Ford of Kentucky. ``When the
debates come, that'll separate them pretty good.''

U.S. TAKING BACK SEAT TO EUROPEANS IN POST-WAR KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   News Analysis  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States led the crusade against Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and provided the vanguard for the
crushing air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But now that peace and reconstruction are in the wind, the
United States is taking a back seat to European nations in the
ground force destined for Kosovo and down the road in the quest for
long-term economic and political stability across the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the shrinking U.S. role lies domestic U.S. politics,
preservation of the U.S.-Russian relationship and the Clinton
administration's bid for the 15-nation European Union to embrace
the former communist nations in the Balkans and Eastern Europe that
have been the front lines of World War I, World War II and the Cold
War.
</P>
<P>
   David Leavy, an official with the White House National Security
Council, said the Clinton administration is deliberately adopting a
subordinate role.
</P>
<P>
   ``We flew the vast majority of attack sorties during Operation
Allied Force,'' Leavy said Tuesday. ``But as we move forward to
implement a peace agreement, rebuild Kosovo and reintegrate the
Balkans into Europe, we think it's appropriate for the Europeans to
take a more prominent role.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Haass, a former Bush administration aide who served on
the National Security Council during the Persian Gulf War, says a
diminished U.S. role makes military and political sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peacekeeping is a less demanding mission _ a mission the
Europeans can fulfill,'' Haass said. ``American forces have more
global responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   European leaders have wider leeway than President Clinton to
commit ground forces to an open-ended peacekeeping mission that is
being designed to encourage uprooted ethnic Albanians to return to
Kosovo from refugee camps and safe havens across Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The post-war mission in Kosovo is an easier sell for European
leaders,'' Haass said. ``There is precious little support for it
here in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton emphasized in a report to Congress Monday, for example,
that U.S. forces will begin to withdraw from Kosovo soon after ``an
initial stabilization period'' as newly trained police forces take
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is playing a dramatically different role in
the Kosovo crisis than it did four years ago in Bosnia, a former
Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the Clinton administration brokered the peace agreement
that ended four years of communal warfare in Bosnia that claimed
200,000 lives. Nearly 30,000 American troops were the vanguard of
the 60,000-strong ground force that swept into Bosnia to enforce a
agreement hammered out at a military base in Dayton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The United States later retained a prominent role in a smaller
``stabilization'' force in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But the quest for peace in Kosovo and the implementation of the
agreement is decidedly a European affair.
</P>
<P>
   The peace agreement with Milosevic was brokered by the envoy of
the 15-nation European Union, Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari,
and the Kremlin's envoy, former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign ministers of Russia, Britain, France, Germany and
Italy, joined Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the foreign
ministers of Canada and Japan, drafted a U.N. Security Council
resolution at a meeting in Cologne, Germany, Tuesday designed to
govern the international force that moves into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Britain _ not the United States _ will lead the 50,000-member
force on the ground with 12,000 troops patrolling roughly 50
percent of Kosovo's territory.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining half of Kosovo will be divided into four roughly
equal sectors patrolled by troops from the United States, Italy,
France and Germany. The United States is contributing about 7,000
troops, or about 15 percent of the total force.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official said Russia may contribute as many as
10,000 troops to the operation, once Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott works out details with Russian officials on a trip
to Moscow on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials readily concede that domestic
politics plays a part in the decision to trim the U.S. role. The
Republican-led Congress, deeply divided on the combat operation in
Kosovo, remains concerned on the scope and duration of U.S.
participation in a follow-on peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   By downplaying the U.S. role in post-war Kosovo, the Clinton
administration also helps allay Moscow. The bombing of Yugoslavia,
which has close ties to Russia, stirred anti-American sentiments in
the communist-dominated Russian parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Clinton administration's decision to adopt a
supporting rather than leading role helps thrust the Europeans and
Russia into the forefront of efforts to fashion stability in the
Balkans. The 15-nation European Union has been leery about
extending membership in its integrated economic market to the
struggling nations of Eastern Europe and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to all of this at the end of the day is the
integration of the Balkans into the economic and political
institutions of Europe,'' said a White House official who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``Europe after all is their continent. It's
their back yard, not ours.''

 &HT;    Atlanta Ballet takes `Peter Pan' to London for the holidays
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Ballet will take a new production of its
full-length ballet ``Peter Pan'' to London over the Christmas
holidays, performing a 20-day engagement at Royal Festival Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The project, including airfare and housing for the dancers,
orchestra fees and transportation for sets and costumes, will cost
about $2.5 million, said Robert Chumbley, executive and music
director of the ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these expenses are guaranteed by Royal Festival Hall,
which is presenting the company as the centerpiece of its holiday
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The newly designed production, which will be seen in Atlanta in
the 2000-2001 season, is underwritten by an $85,000 grant from the
Katherine John Murphy Foundation of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   At its Atlanta performances in 1997, the ballet used sets and
costumes from Cincinnati Ballet and Ballet West of Salt Lake City,
its co-producers. Atlanta Ballet artistic director John McFall
redid the choreography, replacing the original, which was by Peter
Anastos of Cincinnati Ballet. The score is by Carmon DeLeone,
Cincinnati Ballet's music director.
</P>
<P>
   For the London trip, McFall wanted a new, all-Atlanta Ballet
production, so the ballet commissioned new sets and costumes from
Peter Cazalet of Cape Town, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the most spectacular set designs I've ever seen,''
said Chumbley.
</P>
<P>
   Backdrops are being constructed and painted in South Africa.
Costumes and carpentry will be provided by the ballet's scene and
costume shops in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be easier to tour,'' McFall said of the new design.
The ballet plans a North American tour of ``Peter Pan'' after it is
seen in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The production will involve all 23 company dancers, as well as
two children from the ballet's school who will alternate as the
youngest Darling child. The Lost Boys will come from the Central
Ballet School in Leeds, England, training academy of Northern
Ballet Theater, which has collaborated with Atlanta Ballet on
``Dracula'' and the forthcoming ``Hunchback of Notre Dame.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the ``Peter Pan'' engagement runs Dec. 21 to Jan. 9,
which dovetails with the company's ``Nutcracker'' (Dec. 3-24 at the
Fox Theatre), extra dancers may have to be hired in England until
the full complement arrives, Chumbley said.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Festival Hall, located in an arts complex on the south
bank of the Thames, is one of London's best-known concert halls.
The London Philharmonic is its resident orchestra, and the BBC
Philharmonic, now based in Manchester, gives its London
performances there.
</P>
<P>
   For the ballet's 28 performances of ``Peter Pan,'' the BBC
Philharmonic will be its pit orchestra, with Chumbley conducting.
</P>
<P>
   With the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden closed for repairs
for at least a year, Royal Festival Hall has been playing host to
the Royal Ballet, English National Ballet and other dance companies
left homeless for the season. Importing an American company is part
of the hall's plans to keep dance on its agenda, according to
Chumbley, and the idea of the ``Peter Pan'' venture came from its
programming director, Elspeth McBain.
</P>
<P>
   The hall has installed a rigging system for lights and scenery,
but ``Peter Pan'' will present a greater challenge: airborne
dancers, which require an extra set of rigging tracks and
reinforced harnesses and ropes.
</P>
<P>
   For the aerial effects, Atlanta Ballet will test the rigging and
practice flying in October at the Gwinnett Cultural Arts Center.
The flying harnesses and equipment are under the supervision of
Flying by Foy, which specializes in theatrical flying and has made
``Peter Pan'' its signature.
</P>
<P>
   However, Scottish novelist-playwright James M. Barrie made sure
that ``Peter Pan'' would benefit more than its audiences or its
stage workers. A provision in his will requires that whenever the
story of the boy who wouldn't grow up is produced, royalties go to
London's Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Ballet's previous experience with international touring
did not go happily. It had planned and announced a trip to China
for June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of cutbacks and restrictions by the Chinese
government, the ballet canceled the project.

MARINES, ARMY CONTINGENT WILL LEAD THE WAY INTO KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A force of 1,900 Marines and 1,700 Army troops will
provide the ``point of the spear'' for U.S. military units that
will move into Kosovo after Yugoslavia signs a peace agreement and
NATO stops bombing, possibly within days, Pentagon officials said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Troops from the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit aboard a
three-ship amphibious group on the Aegean Sea and Army soldiers
based in Albania will be ``the enabling force,'' or the lead
element of the U.S. contribution to the 50,000-member Kosovo
peacekeeping mission, dubbed Operation Joint Guardian.
</P>
<P>
   In a potential logistics logjam, much of the NATO military
equipment and personnel that will flow into Kosovo will travel over
one highway that runs north from Skopje, Macedonia, to Pristina,
the capital of Kosovo. Macedonia borders Kosovo to the south.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. troops will conduct security and reconnaissance
missions and establish base camps in a U.S.-controlled sector of
Kosovo until the arrival of 7,000 heavily armed Army troops, mostly
based in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. forces could be inside Kosovo within days after a peace
agreement is signed and NATO verifies that Yugoslavian forces are
being withdrawn from Kosovo and the bombing is halted, said
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,700 Army troops will come from Task Force Hawk, the U.S.
protection force sent to Albania shortly after the NATO conflict
with Yugoslavia began March 24.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines and Army troops will be well-protected as they take
up positions inside Kosovo, a province of Serbia, which is the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia. NATO bombing over the last 11
weeks was intended to halt ethnic killings and removals by Serb
troops against the ethnic Albanian population of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines will unload at the Greek port of Thessaloniki and
move by bus and helicopter to a staging area in Skopje. They then
will move by road in armored personnel carriers and humvees and by
helicopter to a sector in Kosovo that would be controlled by U.S.
forces. Along the way, they will begin mine clearing operations for
forces that follow, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines will bring with them light-armored vehicles, which
carry 25mm rapid-fire cannons, anti-tank missiles and mortars, and
amphibious assault vehicles, which carry machine guns and grenade
launchers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Marines will bring more than a dozen support
helicopters, four ``Cobra'' attack choppers and six AV-8B Harrier
jump jets that can fly low and slow to protect ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   The initial Army contingent will include eight Apache anti-tank
helicopters, two light infantry companies, an anti-tank company, a
company of Bradley fighting vehicles and artillery, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   The Army troops will be shifted to the staging area in Skopje,
about 100 miles to the east from their current position in Albania.
``From Macedonia, they'll move in with the Marines to Kosovo and
assume the first positions in the American sector,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   Current plans call for the Marines to eventually withdraw to
their ships and for the Army to dispatch three armored battalions
from the 1st Infantry Division, nicknamed the ``Big Red One,''
based in Germany, with M1A1 main battle tanks, engineers to build
roads and bridges, attack helicopters, artillery and military
police.
</P>
<P>
   Under the NATO plan, Kosovo would be carved up into five
sectors. The United Kingdom will be responsible for the largest
sector, about 50 percent of Kosovo, including the capital of
Pristina, while the United States, France, Italy and Germany will
control equal segments of the remaining half.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. sector will be along the Macedonian and Serbian
borders.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Much cooler air will affect New England on Wednesday behind a
cold front sliding southward through the region. Indeed, afternoon
readings will be about 30 degrees colder than Tuesday, particularly
near the Northeast seaboard, where onshore breezes will import
chilly, ocean air inland. Isolated showers may accompany the return
to cooler conditions as a jet stream disturbance passes overhead.
</P>
<P>
   The weather will remain rather hot and humid across the Great
Lakes and Middle Atlantic states, excepting the Atlantic coast,
where developing sea breezes temper the heat. Beneath partly to
mostly sunny skies, afternoon readings will reach well into the 80s
over the region, exceeding 90 degrees in several locations.
</P>
<P>
   Bands of showers circulating around low pressure in the eastern
Gulf of Mexico will affect portions of the Florida peninsula on
Wednesday. More than an inch of rain will douse a few locations
with local flooding possible. Thunderstorms will also erupt in
southeastern Texas and southern Louisiana as humid air is lifted
along a sea breeze front, which is a boundary separating hot and
humid air over interior sections from cooler air originating over
the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Strong thunderstorms, capable of producing damaging winds and
large hail, will occur in the northern Plains and upper Mississippi
Valley ahead of a potent cold front. Unusually cool air will arrive
behind the front across the northern Rockies. Clouds will linger in
the Northwest, to the west of the Cascades, while the Southwest
stays mainly sunny and seasonably hot.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Ozone Pollution &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ozone in the stratosphere is a gas that is essential in
protecting humans from carcinogenic ultraviolet radiation from the
sun. However, an increase in ozone near the surface of the Earth
can be the harmful by-product of heat wave conditions. Ozone is the
primary ingredient of photochemical smog that plagues urban areas
in summer. Sunlight reacts with clouds of hydrocarbons and carbon
monoxide emitted by automobiles and industries to produce ozone.
When winds are light, ozone concentrations can increase to levels
that irritate the eyes and throat and damage vegetation.

SAUDIS AND EMIRATES AT ODDS OVER IRAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ After years united by worries about Iran,
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have become embroiled in
a bitter dispute over the idea of reconciliation with the Tehran
government.
</P>
<P>
   Harsh exchanges between Arab allies in the Persian Gulf are rare
and seem to reflect broader differences about how the Arabs should
respond to overtures from Iranian President Mohammed Khatami, who
in May became the first Iranian leader since 1979 to visit the Arab
world.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Syria and Qatar, Saudi Arabia was host to Khatami on
that tour, showing a willingness to warm a relationship riven for
more than two decades by hostility and suspicion. That was seen as
a betrayal by the United Arab Emirates, which still regards Iran as
a foe.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Emirates Foreign Affairs Minister Rashid
Abdullah al-Nuaymi complained that any reconciliation with Iran
would come at his country's expense. The Saudi defense minister,
Prince Sultan, quickly shot back, saying that view was mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any case, the ignorant is his own enemy,'' Prince Sultan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are the two most
powerful members of the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council, an
alliance established in large part to create a common military
front against Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats interviewed by telephone said they did not believe
that the dispute would lead to any serious rupture. But they did
say that it seemed to reflect the combination of hope and
uncertainty with which many Arabs regard Iran. Under Khatami, a
relative moderate, Iran has worked to court its Arab neighbors. But
it remains a formidable military force, and in the past it has
called for the toppling of gulf monarchies and for the
establishment of more Islamic states.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Bahrain and Kuwait, Saudi Arabia has a substantial
minority population of Shiite Muslims, who are seen as potentially
receptive to any criticism of the Sunni-led gulf states. The
populations of Qatar, Oman and the United Arab Emirates include far
fewer Shiites, but the Emirates has long felt threatened by Iran's
occupation of three gulf islands not far from its shore.
</P>
<P>
   The islands of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tumbs were
occupied by Iran in 1971, when Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was still
in power. Iran says the islands are part of its territory, which
the Emirates vigorously disputes. In the past, the Gulf Cooperation
Council has taken strong stands against Iran's occupation of the
islands. But officials in the Emirates are making clear their
concern that the allure of warmer ties with Iran might cause the
solidarity to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Reuters quoted a senior official of the Emirates as
saying that his country was ``very much displeased'' with other
gulf countries for their failure to press Tehran on the islands
issue during Khatami's visit.
</P>
<P>
   Among other Arab countries debating whether to move toward
closer relations with Iran is Egypt, which has still not restored
the air links and full diplomatic relations with Tehran that it
severed after the 1979 revolution.
</P>
<P>
   On both sides, there are major irritants. As Egyptian officials
note whenever the issue comes up, a street in downtown Tehran is
still named for one of the Egyptian militants, Khaled
al-Eslambouli, who assassinated President Anwar Sadat in 1981, a
leftover from the days when Iran openly championed revolution.
</P>
<P>
   On Iran's side is the fact that the shah is buried in Egypt _ a
reminder of the sanctuary that the Cairo government gave to him
after he was forced to flee Iran.

THE TONY AFTERMATH: 4 SHOWS TO CLOSE ON SUNDAY
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Faced with wilting box office numbers and scant
success at the Tony Awards, four Broadway productions announced
Tuesday that they would close on Sunday. Among them is the musical
``The Civil War,'' which producers say will have lost an estimated
$8 million in its two-month run at the St. James Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Officials for two other productions, the long-running revival of
``The Sound of Music'' and the play ``Night Must Fall,'' said their
performances would end later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The announcements were part of an annual rite, as Tony losers
realized they would have little fodder for marketing or advertising
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   This year proved no exception as producers of ``The Lonesome
West'' and ``Not About Nightingales,'' both of which were nominated
and lost in the category of best play, said they would shutter at
week's end. Also closing on Sunday is the musical revival of
``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown,'' which won Tonys in two acting
categories but failed to win for best revival.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest money loser by far is ``The Civil War,'' with a
score by Frank Wildhorn, which opened to poor reviews in late
April. Scott Zeiger, one of the producers, said it had been losing
more than $100,000 a week. ``The level of the enthusiasm in the
theater has not translated to the box office,'' Zeiger said. ``The
word of mouth has just not been happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The financial picture for ``Charlie Brown'' was also sobering.
It cost $4.2 million to produce and had been losing money every
week. Producers of the show had a glimmer of hope when Kristin
Chenoweth and Roger Bart won Tonys on Sunday for best featured
actress and actor in a musical. But the show lost as best musical
revival to ``Annie Get Your Gun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lonesome West,'' Martin McDonagh's black comedy, was a
disappointment for producers, who brought the show in on the heels
of McDonagh's highly successful 1998 entry, ``The Beauty Queen of
Leenane.'' Randall Wreghitt, a producer for the play, said the
show's loss would be $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Misery loves company,'' Wreghitt said of the closing shows,
``but this is a company I'd rather not be part of.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Not About Nightingales'' closing was less of a surprise.
The play, written by Tennessee Williams in 1938 but only recently
produced, had been expected to close by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a rough week on Broadway, with the Tony Awards
broadcast receiving lackluster ratings and an outcry arising when a
production number from ``It Ain't Nothin' but the Blues'' was cut
from the ceremonies. (David Letterman's ``Late Show'' agreed
Tuesday to present the number on Wednesday on CBS.) Several of the
closing shows will tour, producers said, including ``The Sound of
Music,'' which will end its 16-month run at the Martin Beck Theater
on June 27 and begin a national tour in August.
</P>
<P>
   Jed Bernstein, the president of the League of American Theaters
and Producers, said the closings were an unfortunate reality.
``Every year at this time shows must face the decision about
whether or not to make a stretch run through the summer,''
Bernstein said. ``Unfortunately, some decide that the demand is
just not strong enough to carry them forward.''

 &HT;    Court says AT&AMP;T cable must be public
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A ruling Friday by a U.S. district judge that AT&AMP;T
must give competing Internet service providers access to its cable
television networks in Portland, Ore., is being hailed as a victory
by MindSpring and other members of the OpenNet Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition is fighting for access to the high-speed cable
modem lines that are still fundamentally closed to competition from
other Internet service providers. They also think the ruling sets a
precedent that could lead to similar decisions elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers who use AT&AMP;T's Internet service _ which can be 100
times faster than dial-up modems _ must subscribe to AT&AMP;T and TCI's
Excite At Home service provider to receive cable modem service. The
members of the OpenNet coalition, which also includes America
Online, U S West, Sprint and Verio say that without access to
AT&AMP;T's network, they could be left behind once broadband becomes
widely available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Requiring open access is the first step,'' says Dave Baker,
MindSpring vice president of legal and regulatory affairs. He says
the Portland decision alone won't give competing ISPs access to the
now-closed cable wires. ``We'd still have to negotiate an agreement
with AT&AMP;T,'' he says. ``Hopefully, this will give them some
incentive to negotiate with us.''
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring says it has made numerous requests to AT&AMP;T to
negotiate for access to its cable lines everywhere AT&AMP;T offers
high-speed cable modem service. ``They've either ignored or refused
these requests,'' Baker says. ``Or at best they've been
noncommittal.''
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring and most industry watchers say AT&AMP;T will appeal the
decision. ``I expect AT&AMP;T will appeal this and do everything they
can do to avoid complying, but this is the law. Hopefully, they
will talk to us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be some incentive for competition,'' agrees
Jupiter Communications telecommunications director Abhi Chaki.
``Nobody is going to invest in broadband if a company is going to
upgrade their infrastructure and hand it over on a silver
platter.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaki says the Portland decision doesn't bring any competing ISP
closer to cable wire access. ``It's just not economical to fight
these little battles as they erupt across the country.'' He says
neither the OpenNet Coalition nor the Oregon ruling is going to
derail AT&AMP;T's cable and broadband strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T is not stupid,'' he says. ``They have armed themselves
with platoons of lawyers taking care of regulatory concerns in
Washington. If the climate wasn't favorable to AT&AMP;T they wouldn't
have wasted their shareholders' money.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal Communications Commission Chairman Bill Kennard has said
he's reluctant to place too many limits on new technologies such as
cable Internet services, which could mean an uphill battle for the
OpenNet Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an insider's game on Capitol Hill,'' Chaki says. ``I
don't think the OpenNet Coalition should be celebrating at all.
It's going to be squashed. AT&AMP;T is going to fight this. It could go
on forever.''

 &HT;    Hispanic-owned businesses thriving in Atlanta area
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Norberto Sanchez opened one small Mexican
restaurant in Norcross, Ga. in 1987, he barely dreamed of the day
his company would own nine restaurants _ two in Kentucky and the
rest in metro Atlanta _ along with four Mexican fast-food
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard work and more work were the main ingredients of
success,'' said Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Norsan Foods also is a grocery and food distributor, and
a subsidiary distributes meat products to the hospitality industry.
</P>
<P>
   Just 10 months ago, Sanchez said, the company opened its first
supermarket, called La Mexicana, in Norcross. Another is in the
works.
</P>
<P>
   As testament to the growth of Hispanic-owned business activity
in the metro area, a new bank _ The United Americas Bank _ will
open its doors in 60 days, with Sanchez as a member of the board of
directors and Sal Diaz-Verson serving as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Norsan Group is among 10 Georgia-based, Hispanic-owned companies
to make the top 500 list in Hispanic Business magazine's annual
roundup. Companies were ranked by 1998 revenue. To participate,
companies must be 51 percent owned by U.S. citizens of Hispanic
descent and must have headquarters in the 50 states or Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the list reflects considerable growth by
Hispanic-owned companies. This year's list includes 81 companies
with revenue of $50 million or more. In 1994, only 53 companies
made that top bracket.
</P>
<P>
   ``The five-year data indicate that the Hispanic economy has
established a viable pipeline for producing large corporations in
the future,'' the magazine observed. The Georgia firms run the
gamut from food service and restaurants to engineering and natural
gas distribution. What they all share, though, is a determination
to grow.
</P>
<P>
   At Cape Environmental Management, President Fernando Rios wants
to quadruple his employee base and annual sales in the next four
years. Currently, the environmental engineering company has 90
employees and $9.90 million in revenues. Lou Sobh, whose auto
dealership is the top-ranked Georgia company on the list at No. 43,
told the magazine he has rejected several buy-out offers. ``I've
been in this business a long time, and I want my kids to be
involved,'' he said. ``I have a daughter who is general manager of
one store, a son that's with me in another, and I'm looking at
opening more because another son wants it.''

 &HT;    Microsoft's Ballmer to communications industry: Join us
 &HT;    (EDS: Runs w/BALLMER-BOX.)
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In Atlanta Tuesday to address a major communications
hardware industry convention, Microsoft president Steve Ballmer
stressed the increasing convergence of his company's software
products and communications products. Ballmer told
telecommunication companies to ``partner with Microsoft as quickly
as possible'' to effectively and profitably deploy new
telecommunications strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody can fill an auditorium like a Microsoft executive. Even
those who regard Ballmer and his boss Bill Gates, as beings only
slightly this side of Darth Maul turned out for his 8 a.m. keynote
at Supercomm, the annual telecommunications exhibition and trade
show being held in Atlanta at the Georgia World Congress Center
through Thursday. Over 60,000 are expected to attend the show
featuring more than 700 exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Ballmer harkened back to that fateful day when
Gates and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen went to IBM with a vision
of a personal computer on every desktop. At that historic meeting,
one of the turning points in the evolution of the home PC,
Microsoft promised IBM an operating system that would make its PCs
operate easily and efficiently. IBM said okay, and the rest as they
say is history.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 years later, Ballmer stood before telecommunications
executives, a crowd just as old school, bureaucratic and skeptical
as IBM was back in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   However, this time, Microsoft has the products to sell, the
money to invest and wisdom to approach the communications industry
with just the right mixture of conviction and humility. ``Now we're
talking about access from anywhere to the Internet,'' he said
describing Microsoft's plans for the company's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a lot of interest in the telecommunications
world about what the heck we are up to,'' he told the crowd. He
proceeded to tick of the various software products and services
Microsoft had to offer not only for the PC, but for cellular
phones, Palm Pilots and other communication devices. ``We are
convinced the nature of what we do is most influenced by broadband
than anything else going.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer also said Microsoft was investing in high speed
technology for both the cable modem technologies and high speed
Internet telephone access, stressing the company had no bias for
either. ``We just want to see these services deployed. ``I'm very
focused and serious about the need for speed,'' he said.
``Broadband is critical.''
</P>
<P>
   After the speech, Ballmer talked about where Microsoft wanted to
go today and in the future. He is keenly aware of his company's
infamous reputation heightened by the on-going federal anti-trust
trial, for co-opting the ideas of competitors. He knows Microsoft's
image needs some polishing and refining before the
telecommunication industry will consider joining forces with it.
``Mostly I'm hoping people will come away thinking that we are
friend, not foe,'' he said. However, he maintains that Microsoft's
current woes with the Justice Department will have no impact on the
business he hopes to garner from the Supercomm crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't care about the suit,'' he said. ``Our
customers don't care. The guys in this audience want to know how to
make telecommunications products. They have their own issues.''

 &HT;    Georgia employment in tech arena growing
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No matter how you calculate it, Georgia is on the
move, in the midst of a technology boom that is having big a impact
on employment.
</P>
<P>
   In figures published last week by the American Electronics
Association, Georgia emerged as 10th in the country in technology
employment, up from 16th in 1990. State officials believe Georgia
may stand even higher now, since the comparative figures used by
the association date to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more novel ways to view Georgia progress is to
examine the concentration of technology employees, using as a base
the total state employment without farm workers.
</P>
<P>
   That perspective shows that Georgia ranks fourth among the 10
biggest technology employment states in terms of the concentration
of technology-related jobs. More than a quarter, or exactly 27.8
were in that category.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to use gross figures rather than the concentration
because that catches the eye, and the attention of the business
world,'' said Jeff Humphreys, economist and economic development
specialist at the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concentration factor does give an interesting perspective,
however.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the gross number of jobs, totaling some 133,000 in
Georgia, by one count, that determines level of investment banking
services and the development of a technology community. These
factors can be the basis for accelerating technology growth.
</P>
<P>
   Activity is so hot that small factors in the analysis of
technology growth make a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, specialists at the American Electronics
Association conceded Tuesday that they did not include employment
in the area of fiber optic cable production in their statistics on
technology jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We excluded that area mostly because the federal government
statistics did not separate fiber optic cable from wire and other
cable that would not be a part of the technology component,'' said
Chris Novak, an analyst for the association.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Lucent facility in Norcross, Ga. is one of the world
largest producers of fiber optic cable and would not have been
counted toward the technology jobs base, Novak said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that for technical reasons the survey had not
include workers in the area of biotechnology, an area that has been
the source of collaboration between Georgia Tech and Emory
University to build a biotech base for Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The association study included three major categories of
activity, including high-tech manufacturing, communications
services, and software and computer-related services.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Conrad, an epidemiologist at Emory, who specializes in
statistical studies, suggested the use of a population denominator
in the examination of technology jobs as a way to compare the
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be interesting to see new perspectives, such
as using population factors,'' he said, ``which would say more than
that California dominates technology.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, many states, including Georgia, are on the move.
While California may have an insurmountable edge, with some 784,000
technology jobs, the gap separating the rest of the top 10 seems to
be closing in.
</P>
<P>
   California added some 66,000 jobs on a net basis since 1990, but
officials at the American Electronics Association said the growth
rate of the California powerhouse lagged behind several states on a
percentage basis, including Texas, Georgia, Washington, Colorado
and other smaller states. State officials here already estimate
that Georgia may have more than 165,000 technology jobs,
representing considerable growth in the last two years.

<P>
   HILLSBORO, Ore. _ When county officials sat down with the Intel
Corp. to develop a package of tax incentives that would keep the
Portland area's largest employer here, the two sides struck a deal
that had some fairly standard provisions. Intel would invest up to
$12.5 billion in new equipment and plant upgrades over the next 15
years, and the county would grant $200 million in property tax
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   And just one more thing, the county asked: please don't create
too many new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual arrangement that reflects both the flush national
economy and Oregon's particular obsession with controlling sprawl,
the computer-chip maker has agreed to pay a ``growth impact fee''
if it exceeds a ceiling of 1,000 new manufacturing jobs on top of
the 4,000 it already provides here in Washington County, part of
the growing Portland metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   Under the package, which county commissioners are expected to
approve next week, Intel will pay the county $1,000 per excess
worker per year if it surpasses the job limit. County officials say
they are thrilled to keep the jobs here but really are not
interested in a major expansion, which would put new strains on
schools, roads, utilities and many other services in an area that
is trying to hold on to the patchwork of farms, forests, orchards
and other undeveloped space that make it a particularly attractive
place to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole process was geared toward consolidating our
victories,'' Charles D. Cameron, the Washington County
administrator, said of the negotiations with Intel. ``We're more
concerned about retaining the economic strength we have rather than
creating more.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Walter C. Peck, a county spokesman, put it, if Intel had
been ``talking about 5,000 new jobs here, the sense is they
wouldn't have gotten to first base'' with any demand for tax
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of providing incentives for a company not to create
many more jobs has a certain man-bites-dog quality to it, county
and state officials concede. Indeed, Bill Scott, the state's
director of economic development, says that the arrangement is the
first such deal in Oregon and that he does not know of any like it
anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   But, the officials say with some pride, if communities really
want to battle sprawl, the innovation here could well prove to be a
national model for how to achieve sensible, precisely defined
growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is maybe a tenor-of-the-times thing,'' Scott said. ``A
few years ago, Oregon was really interested in all the jobs we
could get. But the political environment has changed. People know
there's more than one side to growth. We aren't just interested in
jobs, jobs, jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   There is some local opposition to the growth impact fee, but not
much.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hair on the back of my neck stood up on that one,'' said
state Rep. Jim Hill, a Republican who is from the area and
otherwise supports the tax-break package.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it could send the message to businesses, `Yeah, you
can show up here, but you're going to pay a premium for it,''' Hill
said. ``I don't think we can afford to do that. I don't think any
community anywhere can sit there and say we're going to pick and
choose who we want to arrive.''
</P>
<P>
   But Scott said the package was a creative one that was not in
any way a slap at businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, the message is more complicated, but it's a healthy
message,'' he said. ``The idea is we want you to have incentives
for investment that also give us ways to deal with livability
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Livability is an especially potent issue to many Oregonians,
whose passion for protecting the state's natural splendor has been
interpreted by some critics as a reflection of a moat mentality and
hostility to outsiders. The state's legendary governor, Tom McCall,
a staunch environmentalist, famously said in his tourism-promotion
pitch three decades ago that visitors were welcome, ``but for
heaven's sake don't come to live here.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the Portland area, planners have brought an almost
religious zeal toward regulating a roughly 400-square-mile ``urban
growth boundary'' area into which almost all development is
channeled, while a broad necklace of green space and farmland
maintains the region's stunning beauty. It is an anti-sprawl model
that other planners from around the country routinely come to
research.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   So, in Washington County, where more than 90 percent of its
population of around 400,000 people live within the 15 percent of
the county's land that is inside the growth boundary, the desire to
limit Intel's job growth has some obvious roots.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Intel, who have worked intensively with county
planners over the years on growth issues, even donating land in
order to place a light-rail station near their offices and chip
plants, said they were as concerned as anyone else in the Portland
area with livability. They said they were happy to agree to the
impact fees, though the idea was unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something that's come up in other communities, so
far, anyway,'' said Bill MacKenzie, an Intel spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the annual impact fee would actually be enough to deter
Intel from creating new jobs here is an open question, though, as
another Intel spokesman, Mike Salsgiver, said, ``It certainly could
be a factor. This is a cost-conscious company.''
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, though, the fees have a powerful symbolic value,
and represent a clear attempt on the county's part to set a target
for new jobs, one that the company says is a reasonable one.
Moreover, the impact fees are also a selling point in information
the county administrators have posted on their World Wide Web site
for local residents who have questions about the tax package.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Intel is combining a $12.5 billion investment
and a focus on job retention, not new employment growth, means new
impacts should be minimal to schools and public infrastructure
(roads, sewers, water systems, etc.),'' according to the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, when the state's timber industry had
collapsed and Oregon's unemployment rate soared into the double
digits, the idea of levying ``growth impact fees'' would have been
almost unimaginable. In fact, six years ago, the state kicked off
its Strategic Investment Program, under which Intel has negotiated
this and previous tax breaks, in a determined bid to attract
high-technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   The state has done spectacularly well with its transition from
wood chips to computer chips, and the state's ``Silicon Valley'' is
a large part of the reason that Oregon's unemployment rate is
routinely below the national level, which is itself at historic
lows.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Intel, with 11,000 employees here over all, is the largest
private employer in the state.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The new tax package is intended, state officials say, to help
mitigate a provision in the state tax code that assesses property
taxes on a company's machinery and other equipment as well as its
buildings and land, and thus imposes particular burdens on the
high-technology industry.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of Intel's investments here will be in
equipment, which sometimes needs to be upgraded in a matter of
months to accommodate manufacturing changes in the fast-changing
industry. And as that equipment is increasingly automated, Intel is
unlikely to be creating large numbers of jobs here despite the
billions of dollars it is investing, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With no sales tax, Oregon has a particular reliance on property
taxes, with what critics call a hodge-podge of breaks to go along
with it: until just a few years ago, for instance, the state gave a
tax break for the construction of nuclear fallout shelters.
</P>
<P>
   The critics also question whether the breaks for the technology
industry amount to ``corporate welfare,'' but in many ways, the
deal Washington County worked out looks to be a good one for
taxpayers. It almost certainly averts a possible large-scale
relocation by Intel to Arizona and New Mexico, which have both
beseeched the company to expand operations there, and among other
things, it guarantees the county nearly $30 million in fees
regardless of whether the company makes any new investments here at
all.
</P>
<P>
   And overall, the company's payments to the county will increase
from $12 million last year to an annual average of nearly $20
million.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also has provisions, the county says, to strip away the
growth-impact fees if the economic situation here reverses itself
and the area wants more jobs. For now, though, even many workers
who hold good jobs at Intel said they are just as happy that the
company has disincentives to create too many more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The housing prices, the traffic, it's all going off the
charts,'' said 37-year-old Mark Kent, a technician, as he donned
the protective clothing for his shift at the company's Ronler Acres
chip plant that is designed to keep all impurities away from the
chips and looks a lot like a NASA-style space suit, though it is
more commonly called a ``bunny suit'' at Intel.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll never be able to stop the growth but if this puts it
at a slower pace, that's good,'' Kent said.
</P>
<P>
   And Dave Stegemann, a litho technician who moved here from
Albuquerque a year and a half ago, said he found the idea of
discouraging growth a bit jarring, but only at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unusual, I'd never really heard of that idea before,''
Stegemann said. ``But then I read about it, I thought about it, I
talked to my wife about it, and it seemed like it's a really
innovative approach. I think it's a fair idea. Growth does have
costs.''

IN SERBIAN HOLY LAND, FEARS OF AN AVENGING KLA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to change dateline to Yugoslavia sted Serbia.)  (rm) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVO POLJE, Yugoslavia _ This is the place where the Serbian
national consciousness was born in a noble slaughter, and the Serbs
of Kosovo Polje are both anxious and defiant. They are less
concerned about the imminent influx of NATO soldiers than about the
Kosovo Liberation Army and the Albanian capacity for revenge.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Serbs who may live in more isolated villages here in
Kosovo, these Serbs, only a few miles from the capital, Pristina,
are not ready to leave their homes and businesses and begin new
lives as refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is holy Serbian land,'' said Ljubisa Lazic, 53, a jovial
telephone inspector who suddenly turned serious. ``Our churches and
our graves are like a stop sign to us _ they don't let us leave
here. If we did, we would be damned anywhere in the world we go,
both us and our children.''
</P>
<P>
   His friend, Petar Rapajic, scoffs at such fervor, blaming the
disaster of Kosovo on bad leadership in Belgrade, Washington and
London that allowed the rise of the KLA. But he also acknowledges
that many Serbs have behaved criminally here in this war against
the Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Rapajic has no intention of leaving Kosovo, he said, but in the
last few days other Serbs have begun to depart. On Tuesday, driving
south from Belgrade, numerous Serbian cars, with belongings packed
on their roofs, were passed heading north toward central Serbia.
There were also at least 10 large trucks and buses filled with
soldiers and military equipment also leaving Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serbs are afraid, and for good reason,'' Rapajic said. ``There
are a lot of burned houses and destroyed lives, and they fear
revenge. They did a lot of bad things to the Albanians that
shouldn't have been done _ killings and burnings _ and they're
afraid that the KLA will appear.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he felt about the Serbian army and police withdrawing
from Kosovo, he said: ``The problem isn't that they are leaving.
The problem is if the KLA comes in. People aren't afraid of NATO or
the United Nations, but of the KLA. And they're not sure that the
foreigners will protect them or fight the KLA. After all, NATO
fought for the KLA.''
</P>
<P>
   The defining myth of Serbian statehood is here in this region,
on Kosovo Polje, the field of blackbirds, where the Serbs lost
nobly to the Turks 610 years ago this month. The Serbian commander,
Prince Lazar, is revered as a saint, but few here are willing to
give the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, that much
reverence.
</P>
<P>
   A young woman, a Serb who would not give her name, said she
would leave Kosovo. She was very anxious about the future, and
furious about this defeat. ``I will kill him,'' she said softly and
slowly, referring to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that his policies had produced Serbian refugees before,
from Bosnia and Croatia, she said: ``It doesn't matter. I will kill
him for all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rapajic, 47, owns four auto service stores and rents another
here. He lives in Devet-Jugovica, a mixed Serbian-Albanian village
8 miles north of Pristina, and he described matter-of-factly how
Serbian paramilitary police burned Albanian houses, sometimes
helped by Serbian neighbors, and how the KLA had killed a man and
his two sons in front of their house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have traumas,'' he said. ``It can't be that the KLA comes to
a house and murders a family, and Serbs can't burn and steal and
loot. God gave no one the right to do these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Rapajic said that the Albanians of his village had fled out of
fear, but that when he attempted to stop the burning of their empty
homes, he was nearly shot by the police. ``They said I was a
traitor to my people and they pointed their guns at me,'' he said.
``So I stepped back.'' It may have been brave, he acknowledged.
``But I don't know how clever it was. But I built my house myself,
and I felt on my skin what it is to build a house.''
</P>
<P>
   When he kept a car for an Albanian friend who fled, Rapajic was
interrogated by 20 military policemen who searched his house.
``They wanted to know how many Albanians I know, how I know them,
why I drove them around,'' he said. ``They asked me for a satellite
telephone and almost said I was working against the state.''
</P>
<P>
   He stopped, laughing. ``I don't even know what a satellite
telephone looks like.''
</P>
<P>
   The police took the car, which they insisted was stolen.
</P>
<P>
   But Rapajic also believes that NATO's decision to bomb set off
the worst of the catastrophe, enraging Serbs against the Albanians
and giving them the pretext for terrible crimes. And this solution,
he says, ``won't solve the problem of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   That is rooted in competing claims to the land, he said, ``and
there is a lot of hatred now.'' Like many Serbs, he would prefer to
divide Kosovo and give the Albanians their own territory, but he
acknowledges that it may be too late for that.
</P>
<P>
   Dragisa Nikolic is prepared to keep fighting. Now 43, he was
mobilized into the army and was wounded May 19 by a KLA sniper near
Grabovac, in the Cicavica mountains only 15 miles northwest of
Pristina. Three more members of his 11-man patrol were wounded in
the same KLA ambush.
</P>
<P>
   Only Monday, he said, a friend of his from here, Marko Vujacic,
37, with three children, was killed, shot in the head by a sniper
100 yards from where Nikolic was wounded.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, driving toward the Macedonian border town of Djeneral
Jankovic, an Israeli journalist, Ron Ben-Yishai of Yediot Aharonot,
and a Serbian driver, Ivan Cvejic, were wounded near Kacanik when
their car was fired upon by snipers.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The KLA is still a big problem,'' Nikolic said, his arm in a
sling and his dogtag poking out over his black polo shirt. ``I'll
fight them again, and I won't leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he believe that NATO forces will demilitarize the KLA?
``NATO will demilitarize us, not the KLA,'' he said. ``NATO works
for them.'' But he said he would not try to fight the peacekeeping
forces. ``Our struggle is not with them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His friend, Boza Tadic, says he will also stay and take his
chance. He is one of the hundreds of thousands of Serbs ethnically
purged from Croatia in 1995 and resettled in Kosovo. ``So where do
I go now?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Two young men, Aleksandar Zivic, 18, and Milan Stanovic, 17,
said they were very nervous, and so were their parents, who talk a
lot about leaving. Zivic's father and Stanovic's father and brother
have been mobilized and are ``in the field'' with the army, and the
young men are very worried about them, too, as the bombing campaign
continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life might become impossible here,'' Zivic said. Why?
``Because the Albanians will be on top.'' And what might they do?
Stanovic said: ``Maybe worse things than what we did to them.''

MOURNERS OF SLAIN PERSONALITY CALL FOR END TO VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSANA HAYWARD  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Stunned by the slaying in broad daylight of
popular television personality, thousands of mourners on Tuesday
demanded an end to the violence that has become commonplace in one
of the world's largest cities.
</P>
<P>
   In a year laden with do-or-die politics as candidates position
themselves for a national election in 2000, the slaying Monday of a
man who for decades was a fixture in living rooms could also weaken
the presidential hopes of Mexico City Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas,
criticized as inept in the face of growing violence in the city.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the attack on Francisco ``Paco'' Stanley, in
which another person was killed and three others wounded in a
barrage of bullets, opposition politicians and critics of Cardenas'
leftist administration called for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Although authorities said they suspected the execution-style hit
to be the work of organized crime, Stanley's death played on the
fears of a population fed up with carjackings, muggings and
kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of weeping mourners attended Stanley's funeral
Tuesday. The soft chants of ``Justice! Justice!'' could be heard
from the throng.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made us laugh. He said laughter was the best medicine,''
said one mourner who didn't want her name used. ``Unfortunately, we
live in hard world. What happened to Paco can happen to me or my
family _ to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Her thoughts were shared by others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impunity is killing us. Where are the authorities?''
Ricardo Salinas Pliego, the president of TV Azteca where Stanley
worked as a host, asked in a national television address. ``Why do
we pay taxes? Why do we have elections?''
</P>
<P>
   The director of TV Azteca, Jorge Garralda, meanwhile, blamed
Cardenas, whose failed presidential bids as a candidate of the
Democratic Revolutionary Party date to 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``The responsibility falls on Cuauhtemc Cardenas, a man who
promised us security,'' Garralda said.
</P>
<P>
   The influential Televisa network anchor Jacobo Zabludovsky, who
is closely associated with the ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party, said ``someone must resign and allow competent people to
protect us.''
</P>
<P>
   He called Mexico City's violent climate ``worse than Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   But at first glance, the killing of Stanley, 56, did not appear
to have anything to do with everyday street crime common in this
capital of 22 million people. The police have ruled out theft or
kidnapping as motives.
</P>
<P>
   At a Monday night news conference, Cardenas blamed opponents for
trying to politicize the crime in time for the presidential
elections and speculated the television host was the victim of
people who wanted ``to even a score.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City Attorney General Samuel del Villar said early
indications ``point to a specific attempt to take his life.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack was reminiscent of other recent slayings of noted
Mexican figures, including presidential candidate Luis Donaldo
Colosio, ruling party official Francisco Ruiz Massieu and
Guadalajara's Cardinal Jesus Posadas Ocampo.
</P>
<P>
   Their deaths have not been solved but have been linked to
organized crime or political plots.
</P>
<P>
   Regarded by many as Mexico's Johnny Carson, Stanley was shot at
close range four times in the face and head while inside his luxury
minivan as he was leaving a restaurant near a busy highway. His
bodyguards were reportedly unarmed.
</P>
<P>
   In the fusillade _ the police said at least 26 shots were fired
_ a passerby also was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Gil, an entertainment Televisa reporter who was a
passenger in the car, was wounded. He was listed in stable
condition Tuesday. So were a valet parking attendant and his wife
who also were shot in the assault.
</P>
<P>
   Three or four assailants escaped into the heavy traffic, and the
police were still looking for them Tuesday.

YUGOSLAVS WANT TO MONITOR RETURNING REFUGEES 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Yugoslav officials, throwing up another
obstacle in military talks on Kosovo, are trying to exercise
control over which Kosovo Albanian refugees would be allowed to
return.
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Ministry spokesman, Nebojsa Vujovic, who is
participating in the talks being held in Macedonia, said here
Tuesday that all ethnic Albanian refugees would be welcome, but
that they should come back through Yugoslav customs and immigration
controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The place to come back is through border crossings,'' he said,
explaining that customs officials at the border could keep out
undesirables or ``terrorists who might come over the mountains
chasing Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of who controls the border appears to be Belgrade's
outstanding demand in the talks in Macedonia. Vujovic said that
NATO's demand that Yugoslav forces withdraw to 25 kilometers beyond
Kosovo's borders had been agreed to.
</P>
<P>
   Vujovic said that Yugoslav control over its external borders was
essential if Yugoslavia's territorial integrity was to be
preserved. He also argued that it was necessary for the security of
the Serbian population in Kosovo, which, he said, would be under
threat from Albanians seeking revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade will be allowed to retain a symbolic presence of
customs and immigration officials on the borders, though they will
be supervised by international monitors, the British foreign
secretary, Robin Cook, said after the foreign ministers of the
so-called Group of 8 countries agreed on a draft resolution to end
the war.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently stung by NATO's accusation that the Yugoslav
delegation was stalling the negotiations, Vujovic said repeatedly
that Belgrade was negotiating in good faith. ``As far as we are
concerned, there are no problems and we are not backpedaling,'' he
said. ``We are straightforward, and very constructive. We are
addressing the technical issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But Vujovic attacked NATO negotiators for their lack of concern
about the Kosovo Serbs, and in particular for the comment of one,
who said that Kosovo would not be a comfortable place for Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo-Metohija should be a comfortable place for Serbs as
well as Albanians because it is their homeland,'' he said, using
the Serbian name for the province.
</P>
<P>
   His comments follow a number of warnings from Serbian
politicians about the predicament of the ethnic Serb population of
Kosovo, and the flood of refugees that may follow the army and
police as they withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Some 200,000 Serbs are estimated to be still living in Kosovo.
They live in all the major towns, and in the large settlement of
Kosovo Polje just outside the capital, Pristina, but are also
spread out all over the province in Serbian villages. Some 70,000
Serbs, mainly women and children, are thought to have fled the
province to other parts of Serbia since NATO began its bombing
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The government appears belatedly to be raising the issue with
NATO, but seems to have little confidence the military alliance
will protect Serbian civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the refugees to come back and live in peace and
harmony and not engage in bloody acts of revenge,'' Vujovic said.
</P>
<P>
   But an army officer in Belgrade, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, predicted a mass exodus of Serbs from Kosovo. Police and
military officers who live in Kosovo will pack up their houses and
take their families with them, he said. Other Serbs will follow, in
particular local government officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite absurd to expect that once the Albanians have such
protection from NATO, that Serbs could stay,'' he said. The rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army would continue targeting Serbs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will not be many Serbs prepared to remain there because
they did not have enough protection, even when they had their own
police.'' Without Serbs in Kosovo, talk of territorial integrity
would be meaningless, he said.

MOURNERS OF SLAIN PERSONALITY CALL FOR END TO VIOLENCE

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Stunned by the slaying in broad daylight of a
popular television personality, thousands of mourners on Tuesday
demanded an end to the violence that has become commonplace in one
of the world's largest cities.
</P>
<P>
   In a year laden with do-or-die politics as candidates position
themselves for a national election in 2000, the slaying Monday of a
man who for decades was a fixture in living rooms could also weaken
the presidential hopes of Mexico City Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas,
criticized as inept in the face of growing violence in the city.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the attack on TV host Francisco ``Paco''
Stanley, in which another person was killed and three others
wounded in a barrage of bullets, opposition politicians and critics
of Cardenas' leftist administration called for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Although authorities said they suspected the execution-style hit
to be the work of organized crime, Stanley's death played on the
fears of a population fed up with carjackings, muggings and
kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of weeping mourners attended Stanley's funeral
Tuesday. The soft chants of ``Justice! Justice!'' could be heard
from the throng.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made us laugh. He said laughter was the best medicine,''
said one mourner who didn't want her name used. ``Unfortunately, we
live in hard world. What happened to Paco can happen to me or my
family _ to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Her thoughts were shared by others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impunity is killing us. Where are the authorities?''
Ricardo Salinas Pliego, the president of TV Azteca where Stanley
worked as a host, asked in a national television address. ``Why do
we pay taxes? Why do we have elections?''
</P>
<P>
   The director of TV Azteca, Jorge Garralda, meanwhile, blamed
Cardenas, whose failed presidential bids as a candidate of the
Democratic Revolutionary Party date to 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``The responsibility falls on Cuauhtemc Cardenas, a man who
promised us security,'' Garralda said.
</P>
<P>
   The influential Televisa network anchor Jacobo Zabludovsky, who
is closely associated with the ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party, said ``someone must resign and allow competent people to
protect us.''
</P>
<P>
   He called Mexico City's violent climate ``worse than Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   But at first glance, the killing of Stanley, 56, did not appear
to have anything to do with everyday street crime common in this
capital of 22 million people. The police have ruled out theft or
kidnapping as motives.
</P>
<P>
   At a Monday night news conference, Cardenas blamed opponents for
trying to politicize the crime in time for the presidential
elections and speculated the television host was the victim of
people who wanted ``to even a score.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City Attorney General Samuel del Villar said early
indications ``point to a specific attempt to take his life.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack was reminiscent of other recent slayings of noted
Mexican figures, including presidential candidate Luis Donaldo
Colosio, ruling party official Francisco Ruiz Massieu and
Guadalajara's Cardinal Jesus Posadas Ocampo.
</P>
<P>
   Their deaths have not been solved but have been linked to
organized crime or political plots.
</P>
<P>
   Regarded by many as Mexico's Johnny Carson, Stanley was shot at
close range four times in the face and head while inside his luxury
minivan as he was leaving a restaurant near a busy highway. His
bodyguards were reportedly unarmed.
</P>
<P>
   In the fusillade _ the police said at least 26 shots were fired
_ a passerby also was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Gil, an entertainment Televisa reporter who was a
passenger in the car, was wounded. He was listed in stable
condition Tuesday. So were a valet parking attendant and his wife
who also were shot in the assault.
</P>
<P>
   Three or four assailants escaped into the heavy traffic, and the
police were still looking for them Tuesday.

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ A day after Indonesia held its first
democratic elections in four decades, the joyful clamor of voters
gave way to a resounding rumble of approval from the financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks in Jakarta surged 12.2 percent on Tuesday, closing at
their highest level since Indonesia went into an economic tailspin
in August 1997. Indonesia's currency, the rupiah, strengthened to a
rate of 7,650 to the dollar, extending a rally that began last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The good feelings were infectious, as stock markets in
neighboring Malaysia and Singapore also recorded powerful gains.
Everywhere in the region, investors seemed to view Indonesia's
harmonious exercise in democracy as a milestone in Asia's recovery
from economic calamity.
</P>
<P>
   Given the dire predictions of election-related riots and
bloodshed, such euphoria is understandable. But many analysts here
said that it would be transitory. Indonesia faces prolonged
political maneuvering that may leave people as baffled as ever
about this sprawling country.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does an election _ however peaceful _ heal Indonesia's ills,
which range from shuttered banks and debt-plagued companies to
jaded foreign investors who still view the country as an economic
leper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The elections are one milestone,'' said Mari Pangestu, an
economist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in
Jakarta. ``But there are two or three other milestones to come. Who
will lead the coalition? Who will be the next president? Who will
get the economics portfolio?''
</P>
<P>
   Based on early returns, the Indonesian Democratic Party for
Struggle seemed likely to win the largest number of votes. But even
if it wins this parliamentary election, analysts said it would have
to assemble a coalition to wrest control of the government from the
ruling Golkar party and its leader, President B.J. Habibie, the
protege of his predecessor, Indonesia's longtime leader, Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as investors and economists weighed the implications of
Monday's vote, their attention swung to the leader of the
Democratic Party for Struggle, Megawati Sukarnoputri, and her
economic advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Megawati, 52, said little about the economy during the
campaign. The soft-spoken daughter of Indonesia's founding
president, Sukarno, Mrs. Megawati ran a heavily symbolic campaign,
drawing on an emotional public yearning for a return to the
Indonesia of her father.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that under Sukarno, Indonesia fell into its deepest
economic crisis until the current one _ with crushing government
debt, soaring inflation, eroding exports and rampant smuggling. In
a speech in 1964, Sukarno told the United States to ``go to hell
with your aid.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her credentials as a nationalist, Mrs. Megawati is not
about to follow her father's lead in spurning foreign money. Her
party has embraced Indonesia's agreement with the International
Monetary Fund, which lays out changes required for it to keep
receiving the fund's money.
</P>
<P>
   John Bresnan, an expert on Indonesia at the East Asian Institute
at Columbia University, said he was surprised that Mrs. Megawati
and other opposition figures had not tried to turn the IMF's role
into a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they have some sense of the severity of the
situation,'' Bresnan said. ``Some of the opposition notables are
now close to being in a position of responsibility, and that is a
sobering prospect.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the polls closed on Monday, the IMF approved a $450
million loan to Indonesia, the latest installment in its
$43-billion rescue package. Anoop Singh, the deputy director of the
IMF's Asia and Pacific division, said Tuesday that he viewed the
election as an ``opportunity to intensify reform efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to heeding the IMF, advisers to Mrs. Megawati say
they are committed to a free-market strategy that welcomes foreign
investment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But that does not mean Mrs. Megawati's aides do not harbor
provocative ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Kwik Kian Gie, an economist who is perhaps Mrs. Megawati's most
influential adviser, recently proposed fixing Indonesia's currency
at an exchange rate of 5,000 rupiah to the U.S. dollar. Without a
stable rupiah at that level, he says, Indonesia's economy will
continue to stagnate because the rupiah's weakness and
unpredictability have hurt the purchasing power of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This proposal is certainly not for the current government,
which evidently cannot create stability, but for the government
resulting from the coming general election,'' Kwik wrote in The
Jakarta Post.
</P>
<P>
   Because Kwik is mentioned as a future finance minister, his
ruminations about the rupiah have alarmed some business leaders
here. Indonesia struggled to maintain a fixed exchange rate early
in the Asian crisis _ abandoning the effort after it squandered
foreign reserves by spending enormous sums of dollars to buy
rupiah. Beyond the currency issue, some executives here said the
Democratic Party for Struggle has a more active bent than the other
major parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some concern that there is a central-planning bias and
an unwillingness to let the market take over,'' said James W.
Castle, a consultant and member of the American Chamber of Commerce
here. ``We've tried to tell them that the regulations of the
Suharto government were fairly good. The problem was corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the next government adopts any innovative policies,
investors said it must tackle Indonesia's pervasive cronyism and a
legal system that leaves foreign banks and other creditors queasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't see how any bank in Frankfurt or New York would
get approval to make new loans to Indonesia,'' said Bill Kaye,
senior managing director of the Pacific Group, an asset management
firm in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye said investors would hesitate to pour money back into the
country until they saw evidence that bankruptcy courts here were
treating creditors consistently. But doing that will involve
challenging some of the most politically connected business tycoons
in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that a resurgent stock market and
strengthening currency will help Indonesia solve its problems. As
asset values rise, it is easier to overhaul debt-laden
conglomerates. And that, in turn, eases the cost of bailing out
Indonesia's banking system, now estimated at more than $40 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the problems facing Indonesia, some experts said they
did not want to diminish the psychological lift that the economy
would enjoy simply because the elections were so remarkably
peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can make people feel safe, a lot of Indonesian money
that went abroad will come back,'' said Rizal Ramli, a prominent
economist. ``People want to be given a reason to come back to this
country.''

BUSH SIGNS EDUCATION BILLS INTO LAW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional ending) 
 
By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROUND ROCK, Texas _ Just three days before he heads out on the
presidential campaign trail, Gov. George W. Bush on Tuesday signed
into law an education bill that pumps a record amount of new money
into public education and proves, he said, that education is Texas'
top priority.
</P>
<P>
   But during a bill-signing ceremony at an elementary school in
this Austin suburb, Bush also urged school districts not to play
games with the $3,000 pay raise the law guarantees every teacher,
nurse, counselor and school librarian.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging he is aware that many teachers are concerned
districts will decrease other benefits to compensate for the pay
raise, Bush said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I strongly urge school boards not to do that. That's not the
intent of this legislation. ... We don't want there to be a zero
sum politics when it comes to teachers. That's not right. School
board members have got to understand our intent in this bill
provides no unfunded mandate when it comes to teacher pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Bill 4 will pump $3.8 billion of new money into public
school funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reading is the new civil right,'' Bush said, quoting a Houston
school official. ``You cannot realize the American dream if you
cannot read. And so I think one of the really long-lasting effects
(of Senate Bill 4) is to make sure that every child is given the
basic skills to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the shrieks of summer school students who welcomed the
governor to Jollyville Elementary School was one youngster who may
be able to read minds. Responding to Bush's question if they knew
what he thinks is most important, one child piped up: ``You are
going to be president?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer Bush was seeking, though, was getting an education,
and he chatted briefly with students about the importance of
reading and stopped in a first-grade classroom to read to them
briefly.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also signed into law two other school-related bills: Senate
Bill 103, which makes the high school exit level exam more
difficult and adds new tests to the Texas Assessment of Academic
Skills, and House Bill 2075, a truth-in-taxation measure designed
to make school budgets and property taxes clearer to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to guaranteeing the largest pay hike the state has
ever given teachers, SB 4 also focuses on three other areas:
</P>
<P>
   _ An end to social promotion, a cornerstone of Bush's
re-election campaign last fall. This would be achieved through
requirements that students who cannot pass certain state-mandated
tests be given intensive instruction.
</P>
<P>
   _ Property tax reductions, achieved through new state funding
that will help school districts pay off debt they have incurred for
building and renovating facilities and lessen their need for taxes.
The average tax rate reduction will be 6 cents, although some
districts would get no reduction in taxes while others are
projected to be reduced as much as 44 cents per $100 valuation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Changes in school finance formulas that will aid fast-growth
districts and mitigate the impact of ``Robin Hood'' requirements on
districts now forced to share their wealth with poorer districts.
</P>
<P>
   He said the $250 million lawmakers put into new programs for
kindergarten and pre-kindergarten will help ensure that schools
meet the goal of having every child reading at grade level by Grade
3 and remain at grade level for the rest of their academic careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be relentless in making sure every child learns
to read,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an initiative I believe is going to change Texas,'' he
added. ``When we teach every child to read, we are going to change
every child's life.''
</P>
<P>
   The intensive instruction programs for students who face being
held back in school if they cannot pass certain state tests will
further enhance students' academic careers, Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of giving up, instead of this great state just
quitting and saying, `We're just going to move you through,' we're
going to make sure that child gets additional help,'' Bush said.
``We're not going to quit on any child in Texas. ... We're going to
end the failed practice of quitting on children.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the lawmakers attending the ceremony was State Rep. Scott
Hochberg, D-Houston, who was a member of the House Public Education
Committee that helped fashion SB 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember coming away from a session feeling as good
about what we did as I do this time,'' Hochberg said. ``we have
provided the means like we never have before for public education
to succeed in this state.''
</P>
<P>
   Hochberg added that any teacher who does not get the $3,000 pay
hike plus whatever step increase they are due to get next school
year should contact Education Commissioner Mike Moses.
</P>
<P>
   Moses said school districts will ``have an accreditation visit''
from TEA if the pay raises are not funded in the manner the
Legislature intended.

U.N. DELEGATE EXPRESSES CHINA'S CONCERNS ON KOVOSO PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Asserting that the U.N. Security Council is not
a ``rubber stamp,'' China's representative here made clear on
Tuesday that Beijing has serious reservations about the peace plan
for ending the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Shen Guofang, China's deputy representative to the United
Nations, said the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia must stop before the
Security Council could vote one way or another on the peace plan.
Russia's representative here, Sergey Lavrov, also insisted on
Tuesday that the bombing the stopped before council action is
taken.
</P>
<P>
   Shen also warned on Tuesday that his government, which as a
permanent member of the council has a veto over its decisions, was
particularly unhappy about two specific provisions of the draft
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   First is a provision demanding ``full cooperation by all
concerned, including the international security presence with the
International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia,'' which
in May indicted President Slobodan Milosevic for war crimes. Shen
called the indictment ``politically motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, he said that China was unhappy that the Security Council
is taking this action under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which
allows it to authorize the use of armed force against an aggressor.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats here spent much of the day privately debating how
China would manifest its unhappiness with these provisions. All
Shen said on Tuesday was that he had referred the text of the
resolution to Beijing for instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats did not foresee difficulties over China's
insistence that the bombing be halted before the new resolution is
put to a vote. They expect Serbian and Western military officials
to agree soon on a detailed withdrawal plan for the Serbian
military at the same time as Security Council members are putting
finishing touches on the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Once the withdrawal starts and the more than one million
refugees and displaced people begin returning to their homes, the
bombing will be halted and the Security Council will be invited to
approve the new peace plan.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's U.N. ambassador, predicted on
Tuesday that such a vote could come within 24-48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   China's other objections, however, fueled more spirited
speculation. Some Western diplomats, including the Americans, were
said to be optimistic that Beijing would not veto the resolution
because of the two provisions. First they argued, while China
complained about Chapter 7 resolutions, it did not use its veto to
block the use of force either in the 1991 Gulf war or in the
Bosnian conflict. Second, a U.S. official said, China did not wish
to be seen as an isolated spoiler _ the country that had thwarted
an agreement that all major countries, including Russia, supported.
</P>
<P>
   A positive sign, one Western diplomat said, was China's decision
on Tuesday to allow speedy consideration of and vote on the
resolution by waiving a regulation that requires a 24-hour delay
before the formal printing of a resolution and a council vote.
</P>
<P>
   Another cause for optimism, said Sir Jeremy, was that despite
Russia's and China's expressed misgivings about the resolution,
neither had yet formally introduced suggested changes in the text.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, drafted by the G-8 ministers, gives the United Nations
sweeping responsibility in Kosovo. Policing the province,
establishing a new judicial system, tackling human rights abuses,
organizing new elections, and enabling the return of more than a
million refugees and internally displaced people are just some of
the challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a much bigger role for the United Nations than what we
were given in Bosnia,'' said a senior U.N. official.
</P>
<P>
   Under the peace plan, Secretary-General Kofi Annan must appoint
``in consultation with the Security Council'' a ``special
representative'' to oversee the civilian structure and insure close
cooperation by the NATO-led military force.
</P>
<P>
   Annan, who until now has been kept largely on the political
periphery of efforts to solve the crisis, said on Tuesday he hoped
that ``whatever hurdles there may be will not be insurmountable.''

ABA PROPOSAL WOULD LET LAWYERS FORM PARTNERSHIPS WITH NONLAWYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A special panel at the American Bar Association rocked the legal
profession Tuesday by recommending that lawyers toss out
decades-old rules that have prevented them from setting up
partnerships with accountants, consultants and other professionals.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that would transform the way legal services are
provided in the United States, the committee recommended that
lawyers and nonlawyers be allowed to share fees and profits. If the
plan gains final approval, it would allow law firms to get into
lucrative new businesses like consulting. And, it would allow
accounting and consulting firms to begin practicing law.
</P>
<P>
   But winning final approval from a majority of American Bar
Association's policy-makers, the House of Delegates, and then from
the separate bar associations and top courts in each state, will
not be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers are sharply divided over the issue, with supporters
saying that their clients want the ease of having one firm provide
all of their legal, accounting and other professional service
needs, while opponents respond that such a ``one-stop shop'' is
dangerous and not in their clients' best interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The avoidance of any conflict of interest is a fundamental
hallmark of the attorney's obligation,'' said Thomas Rice, chairman
of the New York State Bar Association. ``One of the great risks is
that the profit motive could begin to skew the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Rice said, the new rules could allow lawyers
specializing in estate planning and writing wills to form a
partnership with financial consultants selling life insurance
policies. A conflict would result, he contended, if greater profits
could be made selling life insurance than from legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   But members of the panel said that they were not lowering
ethical standards that lawyers must follow. They said that all
lawyers, whether they work in a law firm or an accounting firm,
must still avoid any possible conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Sherwin Simmons, chairman of the panel that proposed the new
rules, said, ``These changes would allow clients more options in
where they obtain legal services, and lawyers more choices in how
they serve clients, but maintain the core values of the legal
profession and the protections those values guarantee the public
and clients.''
</P>
<P>
   The new rules would allow lawyers to practice in what the panel
called ``multidisciplinary firms,'' which would provide both legal
and other professional services.
</P>
<P>
   Already the Big Five accounting firms have added legal work to
the myriad of services they provide for their corporate clients
outside of the United States. The giant accounting firms have long
hired lawyers to prepare tax returns for clients, but they have
hired so many non-tax lawyers in other countries that they are now
among the biggest law firms in the world.
</P>
<P>
   According to a November survey by the American Lawyer magazine
the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers had 1,663 non-tax
lawyers outside the United States, enough to make it the third
largest law firm in the world. Just behind was Arthur Andersen,
with 1,500 non-tax lawyers, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Big Five firms welcomed the panel's proposal
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission's recommendations are a step in the right
direction,'' said Richard Spivak, managing partner of Arthur
Andersen's tax practice in North America.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan would put up some high hurdles for giant accounting
firms. The panel recommended that any firm providing legal services
would have to abide by the same conflict rules that law firms must
now meet. Those rules say that a firm must check its entire list of
clients for possible conflicts before accepting a new client.
</P>
<P>
   For the Big Five, which have thousands of clients, the
requirement could be difficult to meet.
</P>
<P>
   And, many lawyers believe that accountants and lawyers have such
different responsibilities that they should never be allowed to
share fees. They point out how accountants, as auditors of public
companies, have a duty to tell shareholders and the public about
problems they find during their audit. That responsibility
conflicts with the duties of lawyers, the critics say, who must
keep their work for the company confidential.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very hard to reconcile those two roles,'' said Richard
Ziegler, the former chairman of the New York State Bar
Association's ethics committee and a partner at Cleary, Gottlieb,
Steen &AMP; Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting firms would also have to find a way to please
federal securities regulators, who have said that they would not
allow an accounting firm that audits the financial books of a
public company to also provide legal services to that client.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some serious implications here,'' Lynn Turner, the
chief accountant at the Securities and Exchange Commission, said
Tuesday. Turner has referred the matter to the Independence
Standards Board, a group that sets many of the ethical rules for
auditors.
</P>
<P>
   The American Bar Association has scheduled a public hearing on
the proposal for Aug. 8 in Atlanta.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brendon Coyle has spent almost 400 performances, his elbows
propped on a bar, a lager or a whisky at the ready, listening to
his fellow players in ``The Weir'' turn a litany of ghostly tales
into a haunting study of collective self-revelation. But playing a
bartender also named Brendan, Coyle never gets a story of his own,
unless you believe _ as some do _ that Brendan's tale begins once
Conor McPherson's play ends.
</P>
<P>
   Coyle's isn't the only performance now on Broadway that puts the
auditor tantalizingly center stage. Over at ``The Iceman Cometh,''
Jeff Weiss and Katie Finneran are portraying just two of the
booze-soaked habitues of Harry Hope's saloon, most of whom are
spoken to far more often than they speak.
</P>
<P>
   At ``Art,'' meanwhile, a Broadway newcomer named Buck Henry is
experiencing his own moments of silence onstage. Although Henry's
fiercely anti-modernist character, Marc, embodies the energy that
drives Yasmina Reza's play, he is eventually forced to look on and
listen as a friend's aria of prenuptial nerves nightly stops the
show.
</P>
<P>
   Can listening be its own reward?
</P>
<P>
   As Coyle's acclaimed performance shows _ in February, he won an
Olivier Award in London for best supporting player _ listening has
the capacity to be as potent as speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought, this part is about being present, about being
there,'' the actor was saying in his quiet, husky voice one recent
afternoon, explaining his connection to a play that he has been
with since its first incarnation. That would have been in July
1997, in a 60-seat studio theater in London that more or less
placed the audience right inside the rural Irish bar that the
character Brendan tends.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Coyle was offered a different role, that of Finbar
(subsequently inherited by Dermot Crowley). Finbar is the lone
frequenter of the desolate County Leitrim pub to make a commercial
success in town, thereby forsaking the rural life spent, as he puts
it, ``on the bog.'' It is Finbar who brings the new arrival to the
community, Valerie (Michelle Fairley), a Dubliner who serves to
transform, at least for an afternoon, the bluff-and-bluster men's
world inside the bar. The others who tell their tales at the Walter
Kerr Theater are Jim Norton and Kieran Ahern, who have also been
with the play since its inception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was still locked in stage time and line counts,'' said Coyle
about the role of Finbar, referring to the customary ways by which
a part is judged. But at the urging of his girlfriend, Emer
Reynolds, a film editor working on a new movie, ``Saltwater,'' that
McPherson is writing and directing, Coyle decided less might be
more. ``She said, `This is the heart of the play,''' remembered
Coyle, who decided that Brendan truly was. He compared the
character to Prospero in ``The Tempest.'' ``Brendan is the
facilitator,'' Coyle said. ``The play couldn't happen without
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The result was an ideal fit, said Ian Rickson, the director.
``Brendan has all sorts of affinities with Brendan in the play,''
Rickson said by telephone from the Royal Court Theater in London,
where he is the artistic director. He said that he and the cast had
discussed the fact that ``The Weir'' is about testimony and
listening. ``We presume listening is a passive activity,'' Rickson
said. ``It's actually extremely active.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyle said the part of the bartender ``is like one long reaction
shot sometimes; I spend a lot of time physicalizing listening.''
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't his mind ever wander during a performance, particularly
as the same tales are told over and over? Coyle said ``applied
listening, almost like meditation,'' was what gets him through the
occasional rough night. ``Sometimes you do think, `Oh, I forgot to
set the video,' but you have to fight that; you have to get rid of
all that rubbish,'' he said. ``Brendan is the character who's
really going to have an impact on the play, so it's all about
transitive concentration and listening.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention, he said, laughing, that by now ``I could recite
the whole play, I'm sure of it. I can prompt any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   At ``Art,'' the Tony Award-winning comedy now on its fourth cast
at the Royale, Henry must leave off the philistine outbursts of his
character some two-thirds of the way through while Wayne Knight's
Yvan delivers a monologue that runs nearly three pages in the
published text.
</P>
<P>
   It's very long,'' Henry said of the soliloquy on which he and
George Segal's Serge must focus during every performance. ``It
gives you a long rest, and it's fun to listen to.''
</P>
<P>
   But is the speech hard to sustain interest in as an active
listener? ``It solves its own problems,'' said Henry, who is also a
writer. ``It's such a complicated story, you have to listen to it
in order to stay afloat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We could almost not be there, except that part of the dynamic
is that Yvan is boring and irritating, too. We're hungry, twitchy
guys who have been waiting for him for 45 minutes so we can go out
and eat. And then we have to listen to this long nightmare of
woe.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Henry added, his own character ``has got a great big
agenda in his head because he knows somewhere down the line _
probably at dinner, he thinks _ he's going to rip this guy apart
for his cowardice.''
</P>
<P>
   How, then, does Henry communicate that during Knight's spiel?
``I'm looking at him with amiable contempt _ I think,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the revival of ``The Iceman Cometh,'' at the Brooks Atkinson,
most of the actors in the 19-member company spend much of the play
listening as one abject barfly after another gets his or her moment
of stage glory before slumping back into the stupor and haze
accompanying Eugene O'Neill's glimpse into the abyss.
</P>
<P>
   The real test comes in the play's fourth and final act, as the
characters hear a marathon confessional from their no longer
beloved Hickey (played by Kevin Spacey) that goes on for more than
20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to listen to the words,'' said Weiss, who plays the
former carnival man Ed Mosher and who is himself a longtime fixture
of the downtown performance scene in New York. ``I can't anticipate
any of it. I have to know how it builds. It's not an intellectual
process but an emotional one. I never take my eyes off Kevin; I
listen to everything he's saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that a long time to remain actively silent? Weiss shrugs
off such considerations. ``Twenty-two minutes may be long in
theater time, but it's a short space of time in any given day, and
anyway, life ultimately is much harder than theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss is onstage from the outset, slumped in varying degrees of
consciousness for as long as 50 minutes before he utters his first
line. B Y contrast, Ms. Finneran's prostitute, Cora, enters the
saloon 45 minutes into the play, though she, too, spends far less
of her time onstage speaking than she does drinking the dyed sugar
water that passes for liquor. (The same substitute can be found at
``The Weir,'' alongside the odd splash of Coors Light.)
</P>
<P>
   ``If your brain goes to the grocery store and you start doing
your list,'' said Ms. Finneran, ``at least then you have a little
time to get yourself back on track.'' By contrast, she added, a
previous New York stage run in John Guare's ``Bosoms and Neglect''
Off Broadway late last year was ``constant banter back and forth.''
</P>
<P>
   In both assignments, Ms. Finneran said, ``you must listen, or
you fall into that black hole where you forget who you are or where
you were born or what you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Uta Hagen, she said, ``who is my teacher, talks about animated
listening: whenever someone's talking, it's about anticipating what
they're going to say next.'' Ms. Finneran pointed out proudly that
Cora has four interjections during the climactic fourth act of
``Iceman'' _ ``more than any other character.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss and Ms. Finneran said Howard Davies, the British director
of the production, had not instructed them on how to listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Howard put together an extraordinary group of people who he
instinctively felt would be able to sustain that alertness through
the play,'' Weiss said. ``The barflies are thinking about many
things, principally getting a drink. They're alert from the outset
to the prospect of a high.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are really an actor, said Ms. Finneran, ``listening is
the easiest thing there is.'' Even if ``some of the boys do
sometimes fall asleep.''

CATHAY PACIFIC CANCELS FLIGHTS AMID DISPUTE WITH PILOTS

 By WAYNE ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. grounded more than half
its flights on Tuesday in an increasingly bitter dispute with
pilots who have been calling in sick over a looming deadline to
accept pay cuts at the big Asian airline.
</P>
<P>
   Cathay has given its pilots until the end of the week to choose
between taking stock options in return for an average 7 percent
reduction in salary or quitting the airline with six months' pay.
The airline said on May 28 that it would dismiss pilots who failed
to accept any option, a threat that pilots say has made them too
sick with anxiety to fly.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, many have been passing along letters signed by
physicians to excuse them from work, the airline said, so many that
Cathay was forced to cancel 67 of its 113 scheduled flights on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope they get well soon,'' an airline spokeswoman said,
adding that the airline was not bothering to question the veracity
of the letters. Pilots have denied they are conducting an organized
sickout.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots of the Hong Kong-based airline, most of whom are
British, have said they will strike if any are dismissed. Cathay
managers were planning to meet on Wednesday with the pilots union,
though there have been no signs of progress since talks on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Cathay says the pay cuts are needed to stay competitive in a
toughening market for international air travel. It says its pilots
are among the most highly paid in the world and as a group
represent 40 percent of its labor costs _ a disproportionately
large amount. The airline last year posted its first loss as a
public company and blamed Asia's economic crisis and high labor
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Cathay's pilots, however, say the airline has acted in bad faith
by trying to force them to accept terms. Pay talks earlier this
year broke down over the pilots' insistence that an independent
auditor be allowed to examine Cathay's books.
</P>
<P>
   Cathay reported an operating profit and posted a net loss
because of one-time write-downs and aircraft deliveries. Cathay
said these adjustments were unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   The flight cancellations are costing the airline $30 million
(Hong Kong), or $3.9 million (U.S.), a day in lost revenue,
according to one estimate, not including the cost of chartering
flights on other airlines for its passengers. Cathay has chartered
aircraft from 10 airlines, some of them direct competitors like
Singapore Airlines, Thai Airways and Malaysia Airlines. Analysts
warn that even if Cathay and the pilots reach a deal, it may be
losing market share that will be hard to win back.

CARTER, AN ELECTION MONITOR, CREDITS INDONESIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA &UR;  &LR; _ Jimmy Carter has monitored more than 20 elections in
16 countries since he left the White House, and not all of them
were showcases of democracy. In Panama in 1989, he went on national
television to denounce ballot tampering by General Manuel Noriega.
In 1992 in Guyana, thugs who had been menacing voters threatened
his life.
</P>
<P>
   But Indonesia, where voters went to the polls two days ago for
their first free election in 44 years, seems to have defied the
cynics. A year after bloody riots forced President Suharto from
power, more than 100 million Indonesians exercised their democratic
rights in a process that, so far, seems to have been largely fair
and peaceful, Carter said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grades we've given . . . are very good,'' Carter said,
after reviewing preliminary reports from 50 teams sent out by his
Atlanta-based Carter Center. The observers visited up to 1,000
sites across Indonesia's vast archipelago. The balloting he
observed was ``very meticulous, almost excruciatingly so,'' the
former US president said. He described poll workers reciting the
oath of honesty, reading the election commissioner's speech aloud,
shaking out ballot boxes publicly to demonstrate they were empty
before the voting, and counting unused ballots to make sure the
numbers were right.
</P>
<P>
   Relaxing in a traditional Indonesian batik shirt, Carter told a
small group of reporters that it is too early to tell if the
election as a whole will be fair, since votes are still being
tabulated. But citing widespread reports of vigilant voters
crowding poll stations to watch the counting, Carter said he was
optimistic that ``that part will be so highly scrutinized by the
public that improprieties will be revealed and corrected.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a marked contrast with Panama 10 years ago, when
President Noriega deployed armed soldiers dressed in civilian
clothes to seize voting sheets at night and replace them with new
ballots the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't speak much Spanish,'' Carter said, but he went on
national television that day to denounce the vote-fixing. ``I'm
still not sure what I said,'' he added with a laugh, but ``I used
the word fraudulent.''
</P>
<P>
   Akbar Tandjung, chairman of Indonesia's ruling Golkar party,
said Tuesday he would respect the election result, whatever the
outcome. Carter said he was confident all rival parties would do
the same, but he observed that, counting aside, he has ``never seen
so complicated a process to choose a president.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the system that debuted Monday, citizens voted for 462
national parliamentarians and 135 regional councilors. Another 65
representatives from underrepresented groups will be appointed
later, probably by parliament, and the military will appoint 38
representatives of its own. That national assembly of 700 people
will choose a president in November.
</P>
<P>
   The process, Carter warned, leaves the door open for efforts to
buy assembly members' votes. He urged that the constitution be
amended to allow direct presidential elections in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Carter also met jailed East Timor resistance leader Xanana
Gusmao, and said the next big test for Indonesia will be the
planned Aug. 8 referendum in the disputed province. Pro-Jakarta
militias have launched a bloody fight against independence
activists recently, putting the safety and fairness of that vote in
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's assessment of the voting echoed the relief and guarded
praise voiced by other foreign observers. Domestic groups were more
cautious, pointing out several isolated violations and calling for
fresh voting in the province of Aceh, where 15,000 people were
reportedly prevented from voting because of threats by separatists
or the military.
</P>
<P>
   Another challenge will be in the counting. Only 2 percent of
more than 100 million ballots had been counted. Officials said the
final tally may not be known until June 21.
</P>
<P>
   Smita Notosusanto, executive director of the University Network
for Free and Fair Election, said part of the delay is because
ballots are tabulated at polling stations and then recounted at
village, subdistrict, district, and provincial levels. What is
more, she added, ``The computer system is a total mess ... and in
some areas they have to carry votes by horseback or canoe.''
</P>
<P>
   Notosusanto warned that ``most of the cheating comes after the
voting.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors were apparently heartened by the vote. The
International Monetary Fund approved a $450 million loan on Monday,
the battered Indonesian currency strengthened, and stocks soared 12
percent Tuesday, finishing at the highest level since August 1997,
when the Asian economic crisis began.

STAMPING GREED OUT OF COLLECTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Sounds swirl at baseball-card shows and Beanie Baby
conventions _ the hustle and bustle of deals made, prices haggled
over, values questioned.
</P>
<P>
   They blend together into a deafening roar best described with
one word:
</P>
<P>
   Greed.
</P>
<P>
   When's the last time a kid wanted an Albert Belle card because
he liked Albert Belle and not because he thought it would be worth
$25 a year from now? When's the last time a parent bought a
mint-condition Beanie Babie because she thought her daughter might
like to play with it and not because she considered it a blue-chip
investment?
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Stamp Show is different. The silence isn't
deafening, but it's a nice change of pace. Held the first Sunday of
every month at the Ramada Plaza Hotel Metrocenter, the show is
devoid of flash, glitz and glamour. And all the more enjoyable for
it.
</P>
<P>
   Glenda Lovera pored through a box stuffed with postcards at Mark
Schulzinger's table, searching for just the right stamp. All around
the room other stamp collectors, hunched over what looked like
miniature drawers from old-timey library card catalogs, did the
same thing. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Possession-minded &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is very intent,'' Schulzinger said as he bit into a
bagel. ``This is more of an anal-retentive hobby than baseball
cards.''
</P>
<P>
   Lovera shook her head and chuckled _ without once lifting her
gaze from the postcards. Well?
</P>
<P>
   ``I am anal-retentive,'' she said. At least she's honest.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the anal-retentive, the collecting, the acquiring is the
important thing,'' Schulzinger continued.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently. Noel Kasper certainly gave that impression. The
acquiring impression, that is, if not the anal-retentive one.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's greed in stamps, too,'' Kas per, a 66-year-old Sun
City resident, said. ``Not money greed. Possession. Not that they
want the stamp to resell it. They want to have it because Joe Blow,
who they talk to regularly about stamps, doesn't have it. And
that's kind of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasper's interest began early.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people start when they're kids,'' he said. ``When girls
and sports take over, you quit. Then when you can't do girls and
sports anymore, you start back up.
</P>
<P>
   ``My latest venture started in 1972. That happens to coincide
with my divorce.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
An older attraction &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kasper, who keeps his most valuable stamps in a safe-deposit
box, once shelled out $3,000 for one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very hard to pull the trigger,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I would think so. Doesn't he ever look at that stamp and see
part of the payment on the Cadillac he's not driving?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm driving a Cadillac,'' Kasper said.
</P>
<P>
   Oh. Still, doesn't he have any regrets?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to have a cabin in Minnesota,'' he said, laughing,
``but I've got all these damn stamps instead.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes patience, stamp collecting. Perhaps that's why the room
was filled with mostly older people. It's not a young man's game
anymore. John Kraft is only 32 _ a relative toddler _ but he
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stamp collecting is coming down,'' Kraft said as he searched a
box for Belgian stamps (he's from Belgium). ``There's a lot of
other interests for people other than stamps.''
</P>
<P>
   But stamps interested him from the age of 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take the time and effort to learn why the stamps were
released, there's always something behind it,'' Kraft said. ``It
can be history, it can be geography. It's a form of curiosity.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, he has the patience part down pat. He found a few stamps
he was looking for, tracking them down in the hardback Belgian
stamp catalog (written in French) he carries with him to shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me an hour, though,'' he said, using tweezers to pull
one of his finds from a waxed envelope. ``But still, that's the
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Fun. Now there's a word not tossed about enough at a
baseball-card show or a Barbie convention. In its own quiet way,
the stamp show offered plenty. Signed, sealed and delivered. &QL;

DOLE SAYS HUSBAND HAS KEY FUND-RAISING ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Elizabeth Dole, continuing to run a distant second
in the polls to Republican presidential front-runner George W.
Bush, said Tuesday that she has turned the corner in fund-raising
with help from the most reluctant source she knows: her husband,
Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, who Wednesday travels to Boston and New
Hampshire, said in an interview that her husband ``never raised
money for himself. He hates to ask people for money. And he didn't
do it in his own campaign. But you know what he's doing? He's on
the phone raising money for me. He's going to do four fund-raisers
in June.''
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of Bob Dole as a financial focal point in
Elizabeth Dole's campaign, while long anticipated by some,
underscores the urgency felt by many candidates to have strong
financial reports to be filed at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   With a number of campaigns suffering from a monetary drought,
Dole could strengthen her position significantly if she proves she
has the financial muscle to fight Bush through the fall and winter.
She told reporters and editors in the Boston Globe Washington
Bureau that she has raised $500,000 in the past week. Now her
campaign hopes that Bob Dole, who last month said it would be
difficult for her to be a candidate if she couldn't raise enough
money, will help erase any lingering doubt about his wife's staying
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind asking for money,'' she said. But, she added,
``It sure is easier when you can ask someone for $1 million than
$1,000,'' contrasting her experience as president of the American
Red Cross and asking for donations with being a presidential
candidate subject to federal contribution limits.
</P>
<P>
   Dole hired a new chief strategist, Tony Fabrizio, who was the
pollster in her husband's 1996 campaign. Asked Tuesday if she is
positioning herself as the moderate in the GOP field, she
responded, ``I'm not the strategist.'' Instead, she called herself
a ``mainstream conservative'' and a ``change agent'' who prides
herself on taking ``cutting edge'' stances and looks for ``the
tough issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole, who started collecting money later than most candidates,
raised $685,253 in the first quarter of this year. Bush, by
contrast, collected $7.6 million in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm suspending judgment until I see the figures for this
quarter,'' political analyst Stuart Rothenberg said. ``She better
have raised $3 (million) to $4 million.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Bush's fund-raising success is draining much of
the financial oxygen out of the Republican race, making it
difficult for most other GOP candidates to raise money. For
example, Lamar Alexander recently laid off some aides because of
financial problems, and two top fund-raisers for former vice
president Dan Quayle recently left his staff. An exception to the
trend is publisher Steve Forbes, who is using his personal fortune
and already is running television advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Tuesday's interview, Dole stressed that she believes
she is gaining support from people outside the political
establishment, especially from younger people. Enthusiastically
recalling the crowds attending her events in college towns, she
said: ``It's not a strategy. It's what's coming to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, she has been on something of a political
roller-coaster ride, bouncing from 24 percent in the polls in April
to 14 percent in a Gallup survey conducted last weekend, far behind
Bush's 46 percent support in the the same poll.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, known for years as a strong antiabortion advocate,
surprised some of her longtime associates by declaring that
abortion should be a non-issue in the campaign. Then Dole told a
New Hampshire audience she favors some gun-control measures,
including safety locks on handguns, an announcement that garnered
much publicity and seemed prescient in light of the Senate's
subsequent approval of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Dole signaled that one of the next issues she will tackle will
be the environment. She said the most important legacy to be left
to Wednesday's children is clean air and clean water. ``Those who
cause the pollution should pay for the pollution,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dole heads Wednesday to Massachusetts, where she once taught
high school and was a student at Harvard Law School. ``Boston was a
second home to me,'' she said. ``I left part of my heart there.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole recalled that when she was one of about two dozen women at
Harvard in 1962, she encountered a male student who questioned why
she was there. ``What are you doing?'' Dole recalled his saying.
``Don't you realize that there are men who could use a legal
education?'' Dole said this man is now a Washington lawyer who is
petrified she will reveal his name.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the only woman in the presidential race, Dole said she
doesn't feel at any disadvantage. To the contrary, she said, the
country is ready for a woman president. ``We are behind'' other
nations, she said, citing Britain's Margaret Thatcher and Israel's
Golda Meir as women who have led a country's government.
</P>
<P>
   After Dole speaks Wednesday at the Harvard Business School, a
speech that is closed to the press, she plans to go to Portsmouth,
N.H. In an ironic twist, Dole now points to her husband's defeat in
the state's primary in 1996 as evidence that she can beat Bush. At
this time four years ago, the Dole campaign notes, Bob Dole was
beating Buchanan by 51 percent to 10 percent but still lost the
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush really hasn't gotten out of Texas,'' Dole said,
suggesting that the front-runner will lose momentum as he heads to
the campaign trail for the first time this weekend in Iowa and next
week in New Hampshire. Asked when she will start heading up in the
polls, she said: ``Wait until next week!''

 &HT;    Crime weapons traced back to states, dealers
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A tiny fraction of the nation's 100,000 gun dealers
sold nearly half of all guns traced to crimes, a new study has
found.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia gun dealers ranked third behind Illinois and Indiana for
the number of guns linked to gun crimes in 1996, 1997 and 1998, the
study found.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1998, Georgia was the leading source of guns used by
criminals in other states, according to Sen. Charles Schumer
(D-N.Y.), whose staff compiled the study based on data from the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said the findings highlight the impact of weak gun laws
in states such as Georgia and demonstrate that a few ``bad apple''
gun dealers account for most of the guns that wind up in the hands
of criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really are some dealers out there who cater to people
who use guns to commit crimes,'' said Schumer, a fierce advocate of
gun control. ``Being the source of a lot of crime guns does not
necessarily mean that these dealers are breaking the law, but it
cries out for an explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   J.R. McCollum, the ATF's spokesman in Atlanta, disputed
Schumer's conclusions. McCollum said the guns traced to gun crimes
most often came from the gun dealers who sold the most guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just logical that you would have high numbers there,''
McCollum said. ``I don't think it's startling.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Schumer's analysis of ATF data, 15 gun dealers in
Georgia were the source of 3,726 crime guns between 1996 and 1998.
Twelve of the 15 dealers were located around metro Atlanta, spread
out among Doraville, Decatur, Jonesboro, East Point, Smyrna,
Mableton and Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   Three others were in Chickamauga, Macon and Bogart. The state
has 2,877 licenced gun dealers as of April 1.
</P>
<P>
   The gun dealer with the highest number of crime guns sold was
located near Decatur. The dealers were not identified by name in
the study.
</P>
<P>
   ATF officials in Washington said they could not comment directly
on Schumer's findings because they did not review his methodology.
But ATF spokesman Jeff Roehm said the bureau routinely traces guns
to identify potential gun traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he said, the bureau traced a number of guns used in
gang crimes in Boston to a gun dealer in Mississippi. It turned out
that a Boston man attending school in Mississippi was using his
relatives in the state to purchase guns, which he in turn
transported to Boston to sell to gang members.
</P>
<P>
   But a high number of crime guns traced to a single dealer isn't
always an indication of a problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're aware of all of the (dealers) listed,'' Roehm said.
``Some are out of business, some are in prison, some are under
investigation. Some of them also have been inspected many times and
are operating completely within the laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said he will introduce legislation this week that will
make it easier for ATF agents to target potentially bad gun
dealers. The legislation would allow the ATF to target dealers for
sting operations and suspend their licences for infractions.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, ATF is forbidden from inspecting any gun dealer more
than once a year without a warrant and can only revoke, not
suspend, dealer licences.
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Rand, federal policy director at the Violence Policy
Center, said the threshold for revoking a licence is much higher
than suspending it, making it more difficult for ATF to act against
dealers who sell guns that they suspect might end up in the hands
of criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``ATF is not being aggressive in revoking licences,'' she said.
``They need some suspension authority.''
</P>
<P>
   The last gun dealer licence revocation in Georgia was in 1996,
according to Schumer's analysis, but that does not include dealers
whose licences came up for renewal and were denied.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, Schumer's study found that 1,160 gun dealers _ 1.1
percent of the nation's total _ were the source of 34,626 crime
guns in 1998, or 45 percent of all the guns successfully traced by
the ATF. One-hundred thirty-seven gun dealers sold more than 50
guns that were involved in gun crimes.
</P>
<P>
   On average, the ATF can successfully trace 50 to 60 percent of
all the guns that local and state jurisdictions ask them to trace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the same stores show up year after year as the
source of crime guns proves that there is a funnel from certain gun
stores to criminals and to the black market,'' Schumer said.
``Criminals and straw buyers seem to know the gun sellers who will
look the other way.''

 &HT;    Republicans take about-face on legislation timetable
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After insisting on a deliberative schedule to
consider gun control legislation in the House Judiciary Committee,
Republican leaders abruptly reversed course Tuesday and announced a
new timetable that by-passes the committee and moves the
legislation to a House vote next week.
</P>
<P>
   The change in tactic is due in part to the discomfort many
Republicans feel about swallowing new gun control restrictions,
Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are uncomfortable with gun issues would rather vote
once, rather than twice,'' Hyde said. ``A lot of people don't want
to vote repeatedly on guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats reacted angrily to the change in schedule, which
effectively denied them another opportunity to capitalize on the
gun debate in the ideologically polarized Judiciary committee. The
committee had been scheduled to consider the gun control
legislation as part of a juvenile justice crime bill this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told they had to go through the committee,'' said
House minority leader Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.), who made himself
available to reporters to voice his displeasure. ``It's now obvious
to me that this was all a show to allow the NRA and other groups
time to regroup.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt's office distributed copies of a National Rifle
Association fund-raising letter that urges its members to fight the
new gun restrictions and warns that the new laws are an attempt
``by gun haters and the enemies of your Second Amendment freedoms
to dismantle the Second Amendment one step at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, adopted by the Senate three weeks ago, would
require all guns to be sold with trigger locks or safety storage
boxes, ban violent juveniles from ever owning a gun, outlaw
high-volume ammunition clips and require criminal background checks
for guns purchased at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA informed its members that it is buying newspaper ads
across the country, manning phone banks ``coast to coast'' and
waging a full-court press to lobby against the proposed
restrictions. The cost of the letter alone, the NRA letter said,
was almost $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders also signaled that they were softening
the most controversial component of the Senate legislation, the one
dealing with background checks at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Senate bill, non-licensed gun dealers at gun shows
would have to sell guns through licensed dealers, who would then
perform the background check. The Senate bill allows law
enforcement officials 72 hours to complete the checks, so as to
take into account that gun shows frequently occur on weekends when
access to criminal records is limited.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said the House bill would reduce the 72 hour time-period,
perhaps to 24 hours. The NRA is opposed to any background check
that is not able to be completed ``instantly.'' The gun lobby also
vigorously opposes the record keeping requirements proposed under
the new bill, claiming they would amount to a national gun
registry.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde and House Republicans are also championing new legislation
geared toward outlawing the sale of explicitly violent or sexual
material to juveniles. It would also require music stores to make
available to parents for on-site review any lyrics packaged with a
compact disc or tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more to this problem of juvenile violence than just
gun laws,'' Hyde said. ``We're trying to address the problem of
juvenile violence in a comprehensive way.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hyde said he also plans to offer an amendment to the bill
that would prohibit anyone under 21 from possessing a handgun, a
proposal also endorsed by President Clinton. Aides to Hyde later
said that the chairman's bill would ban those under 21 from
purchasing a handgun, not possessing one.

TOWN CHAFES UNDER REBEL PRESENCE

<P>
   KRUMA, Albania _ It was a sleepy mountain border town, then a
massive refugee camp. And now, this town has morphed into a de
facto base for the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Frightened residents and refugees here are not happy about their
new neighbors, especially after getting shelled by the Serbs in the
past week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my country, but I don't think they should have a
military base in the city,'' said Uke Sheta, Kruma's deputy mayor.
``It's a big risk. I'm the deputy mayor, and no one listens to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not your ordinary ``not in my backyard'' syndrome. Some
say the new locals in Kruma have taken over. And the presence of
the KLA may well be what has been attracting so much artillery
recently. Several days ago, a woman was killed and six people were
injured after eight shells landed in Kruma.
</P>
<P>
   Technically Albania is not part of the KLA effort, though it is
widely known that the rebel army trains and operates bases on the
Albanian side of the border. The presence of the KLA in Kruma could
draw Albania closer into the war, residents and refugees worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are shelling the city because there are UCK here,'' said
Lulzim Gashi, 21, a refugee from Djakovica, referring to the
Albanian name for the KLA. ``Everybody's leaving _ not just
refugees, but also the townspeople,'' said Gashi. He himself is
waiting for family members to get him the cash to go eight hours
south to Tirana.
</P>
<P>
   At the peak of the refugee crisis, the town of Kruma and the
surrounding villages was populated by around 25,000 permanent
residents and 30,000 refugees, Sheta said. The combined number for
the northern region is now down to about 17,000 residents and very
few refugees, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the refugees left because of the shelling. Many were
moved south as part of a general practice by aid organizations to
spread the refugee burden around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
estimates that about 4,000 people have left Kruma in recent days,
when fighting escalated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are afraid. We would like to go, but we have nowhere to
go,'' said Zenon Gashi, 47, who has been staying for two months on
the floor of a central mosque with her 11 children.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA has practically usurped authority from the local police,
Sheta said, adding that there has been ``a bad relationship''
between the KLA and the local government. But the local authorities
can do nothing, Sheta said.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers seem to be everywhere in Kruma, strutting in
camouflage uniforms and yellow, red, and black UCK badges. A KLA
hospital dominates the center of town, and uniformed soldiers take
up most of the tables at the outdoor cafes. UCK military vehicles
cruise down the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a few children playing in the streets and old men
sitting in the sun, Kruma looks more like an official army base
than a mountain town.
</P>
<P>
   Sheta estimated that there are 5,000 KLA soldiers in Kruma and
the surrounding mountains. The men come down to Kruma to rest and
get medical care, he said. KLA soldiers refused to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents say the KLA makes Kruma better protected. ``When
they are near us, we are feeling safe,'' said Nehbi Leshi, 73. The
KLA has responded to Serbs shelling, while ``the Albanian army does
nothing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of them I am wounded,'' scoffed an 18-year-old
Albanian Army soldier, who would not give his name. ``When will
they go?''

THEATER OWNERS SAY THEY WILL ASK FOR PHOTO I.D.'S FROM YOUNG
MOVIEGOERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Egged on by President Clinton, representatives of
movie theater owners across the country announced on Tuesday that
they would require teen-agers to present a photo identification
card when they showed up without an adult to see an R-rated film.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was the latest effort by politicians and
officials from the entertainment industry to respond to public
concern that pervasive violence in movies and on television was
partly responsible for the shootings this spring in high schools in
Littleton, Colo., and Conyers, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   William Kartozian, president of the National Association of
Theater Owners, said he expected most theaters to begin enforcing
the policy within the next 30 to 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel this will go a long way in carrying out our
responsibilities to the parents of America,'' said Kartozian as he
stood next to the president at the White House. The association
represents the owners of theaters that have about two-thirds of the
country's movie screens.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton agreed with Kartozian's assessment. ``When you drop them
off,'' the president said, ``you shouldn't have to worry about your
G-rated kids getting into violent or suggestive R-rated movies.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie-rating system was adopted in 1968 by the Motion
Picture Association of America and relies on voluntary enforcement
by the theaters. An ``R'' rating means ``restricted: under 17
requires accompanying parent or guardian.'' The rating is usually
based on sex, violence and language.
</P>
<P>
   But many authorities on adolescent psychology said that
requiring proof of age could backfire, making violent movies even
more enticing to young teen-agers because of the challenge of
getting in, and creating a new market for fake identification
cards.
</P>
<P>
   And the teen-agers themselves who are used to going to movies
supposedly forbidden to them were blase, saying they were confident
that in the age of multiplex cinemas they would still have no
problem seeing any movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I have to do is say I am going to see `Star Wars' and then
sneak into the movie I really want to see,'' said Paul McSweeney,
14, who attends West High School in Madison, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth I. Howard, a psychology professor at Northwestern
University who specializes in adolescence and who has six children
of his own, the youngest of whom is 11, said of the new policy: ``I
suspect it'll promote kids sneaking into movies, though now they
may have to be a little more clever.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, Howard said, the traffic in phony identification cards
is generally confined to young people who are 19 or so and want to
buy beer or get into bars where the legal age is 21. The new movie
policy, he said, could not be enforced and would drive the market
for fake i.d.'s down to 14- and 15-year-olds
</P>
<P>
   ``What are they going to do,'' Howard asked, ``throw all the
15-year-olds in jail?''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Cohen, director of the Child Studies Center at Yale
University, said that the intention of the policy was right but
that the result might be to make young people even more cynical
about the rules set by adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents should be helping their children decide what movies to
go to,'' Cohen said. ``Neighborhoods should be deciding what movies
should be shown.''
</P>
<P>
   The word in the industry is that enforcement of the
age-restriction policy has been more rigid in small towns and
suburbs in the South and Midwest and less so in big cities and on
the coasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love,'' which won the Academy Award for the
best movie of 1998, was rated R. So were three of the other four
films nominated for the award, all but ``Life is Beautiful,'' which
was set in a Nazi concentration camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a certain way, kids want to see an R-rated movie because
it's illegal,'' said Jeff Vierstra, another 14-year-old from
Madison, ``but I go to see them because they're good.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview after the announcement on Tuesday, Kartozian of
the theater owners association said he knows that underage
youngsters sneak into movies with abandon and that they might even
be more attracted by the prohibition. ``But we're going to try to
be vigilant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the high school shootings, lawmakers, especially those
opposed to gun control, have been scrambling to offer legislation
meant to reduce teen-agers' exposure to violence in entertainment.
Among the bills in the drafting stage is one that would impose
stiff fines on theater owners who violate the age requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Kartozian acknowledged that one reason for the new policy was to
try to head off onerous legislation, but he said the main motive
was that theater owners wanted to live up to their responsibilities
to the community.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The source of the politicians' interest in the matter is not
difficult to find. A Gallup Poll last month found that 62 percent
of adults said violence in popular entertainment was ``one of the
major causes of violence among young people.''
</P>
<P>
   A poll in April by CNN and USA Today the day after the shootings
in Littleton found that 81 percent of adults thought stricter
regulation of violence on television and in movies would reduce
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Since the high school shootings, Clinton has pressed Congress to
enact gun-control laws. And he has had one event after another to
express his interest in limiting violence on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   In early May, he convened a White House meeting on youth and
violence that some in the entertainment business refused to attend
because they thought it was an effort to demonize Hollywood for the
prevalence of violence in society.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, the president raised $2 million for the
Democratic Party at a dinner in Hollywood given by top movie
executives. At the dinner, he gently chided his hosts for including
too much violence in their products.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has generally pulled his punches when dealing with his
reliable donor base in the movie industry.
</P>
<P>
   The president has also directed the surgeon general to study the
possible link between stylized violence in popular culture and real
violence by young people. And he has asked the Justice Department
and the Federal Trade Commission to study whether the entertainment
industry was violating its own voluntary codes by enticing children
to watch violent films, listen to explicit music and play murderous
video games.

BUSH HAS HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR N.H.   VISIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As he prepares for his first presidential campaign visit to New
Hampshire next week, Texas Governor George W. Bush said Tuesday
that ``expectations are out of sight for me.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview with reporters, Bush said he knows he
is behind when it comes to one-on-one campaigning for the 2000
race, and he realizes that there are people hoping to see him fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognize I'm late, and I know I've got a lot of work to
do,'' Bush said. ``I'm mindful of how important the New Hampshire
primary is.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Bush sent a letter to New Hampshire Secretary of
State William Gardner, promising not to campaign or file a
declaration of candidacy in any state that holds its presidential
primary earlier than seven days after the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is good news for New Hampshire,'' said Gardner, who is
currently looking at a Feb. 8 primary date to avoid conflicting
with South Carolina's primary.
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire House will take up legislation Wednesday
encouraging candidates for president to support the state's
heritage as the first-in-the-nation primary and allowing Gardner to
set the primary date as early as December 1999. State law requires
that New Hampshire hold its presidential primary at least one week
before any other state. Every four years, New Hampshire lawmakers
jockey to prevent other states from impinging on their weeklong
buffer.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush arrives in New Hampshire on Monday, he will attend a
breakfast in New Castle, speak to 900 people at a luncheon in
Manchester and visit a fire station in Bow. He is also planning to
shake hands with the workers at Hadco Industries in Derry during
the shift change early Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to shake as many hands as I can,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first hurdle is to tell people what's in my heart and what
I believe and do it in as plain a speaking way as possible,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what he planned to speak plainly about, Bush said tax
cuts, free trade, strengthening the military, and improving
education.
</P>
<P>
   Before going to New Hampshire, Bush will spend Sunday with his
father, the former president, to celebrate his 75th birthday. He
already has gotten some advice from his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would say it's much better to win than lose,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   But the younger Bush acknowledged that there are those who would
prefer to see him lose the race for the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come with a lot of people interested, and some people
interested in figuring out how not for me to do well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That could not have been more true Tuesday as Joe Andrew,
national chairman of the Democratic National Committee, toured
Boston and New Hampshire, promising an aggressive scrutiny of
Bush's candidacy. And he warned that Bush is much farther to the
right politically than he portrays himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``People know nothing about Governor Bush except that he has a
middle initial,'' Andrew said. ``But for his daddy, he would not be
running.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Bush said he hopes that when he leaves New
Hampshire Tuesday, voters will say: ``This is a man who speaks
plainly, that he's got a philosophy, that he knows how to lead,
that he's a hard worker and takes nothing for granted.''

SPORTS COLUMN: RUBES HAIL FROM OUTER BOROUGHS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mark Jackson thought he was a gym rat until he met up
with Chris Mullin. Then he discovered how far he was down the
rodent chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy was phenomenal,'' Jackson recalls. ``I was doing my
fancy stuff, and he was just scratching away.''
</P>
<P>
   They were together for two years at St. John's University in
Queens, and now they are together with the Pacers in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   The tabloid cliche is that the Pacers are ``hicks'' _
conveniently rhymes with ``Knicks'' _ but the reality is that these
two hail from the land of ``Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard,''
and play with the savvy of people who can safely jaywalk across
Union Turnpike with their eyes closed and their headset on full
blast.
</P>
<P>
   These two alleged rustics played the more sophisticated game in
Monday's 90-78 victory that tied this playoff series at two games
each. Jackson distributed the ball, and the Knicks never seemed to
figure out that Mullin and Jalen Rose shoot left-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night in Indiana, Mullin and Jackson will try to beat
the team of their childhood, the team that let Jackson go, the team
that has never managed to bring Mullin home, and probably just as
well for both of them.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson played five years for the Knicks before being run out by
the kind of corporate dysfunction that never seems to go out of
style at the Garden. Mullin is better off under the stability of
Donnie Walsh and Larry Bird, to say nothing of supportive fans who
do not scream for blood when the home team falls behind early, as
they do at the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Now thriving in the hinterlands, Jackson and Mullin first met in
their home borough of Brooklyn. Looie Carnesecca of St. John's was
in the stands, scouting Mullin with Xaverian, when he spotted
Jackson, a sophomore with Loughlin. Two years later he brought
Jackson out to the campus in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Carnesecca told me to work with Mark,'' Mullin recalled
in his still-blessedly lush Bruklun accent. ``I'd be pushing off on
him, he'd be pushing off on me.''
</P>
<P>
   They got to the Final Four together in 1985, and soon went their
separate ways. Mullin played in Golden State, confronted his
alcoholism, has played sober and steady for a decade. Jackson came
to the Knicks, young and headstrong, which led to his exile. If the
Knicks' management had been able to see past the occasional
showboating, to the intelligent and caring person within, Mark
Jackson could still be playing point guard for the Knicks. Instead,
he has been reunited with his old gym-rat mentor. ``He's one of my
favorite people,'' Mullin said Monday. ``I never knew how much I
missed him until I got here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just special to me, the relationship we had,'' Jackson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is a minister now, married with three children, still
intense about controlling the game, but a calm man away from the
court. He has seen his close friend, Patrick Ewing, hear the
catcalls in Jackson's hometown _ but all the same, Jackson loves
coming back. He was walking in midtown Monday, trying to rid
himself of the demons of Saturday's last-moment loss to the Knicks,
when he opted for that most cathartic of remedies, a good
old-fashioned head-shaving. The Pacers used to shave their heads
for the playoffs, but this year they got away from it. Jackson went
into the first barbershop he saw and asked for the Full Jordan, but
that wasn't the end of it. The barber then held an electronic
vibrator in the palm of his hand and applied it to Jackson's smooth
dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt great, man,'' Jackson reported after beating the
Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   How much did the haircut cost? Last week Bob Baffert, the
white-maned trainer of Silverbulletday, reported a $78 trim at the
salon in his upscale Manhattan hotel. Jackson's tab, down a side
street, was exactly one-sixth of Baffert's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirteen dollars,'' Jackson said. ``But I gave him $30.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jackson got on the team bus a few hours later, Reggie
Miller spotted His Baldness and shouted, ``It's on,'' an old war
cry that still worked. ``Just getting back to the old days,''
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``old days'' were reinforced before the game when an Italian
leprechaun named Carnesecca popped his head into the locker room
and hoarsely wished Mullin and Jackson good luck.
</P>
<P>
   Bald and brash, Jackson seemed to finally set a pattern for this
round, now that the Knicks are facing the reality of life without
Ewing. The big man from Georgetown kept them out of the college
finals in 1985. This time Mullin and Jackson could return the favor
_ the revenge of the gym rats. &QL;

SCIENTISTS REPORT CREATION OF 2 NEW ELEMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a discovery that came as a complete surprise to most nuclear
chemists, an international team of scientists at Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory in California has added two new elements to the
periodic table.
</P>
<P>
   The laboratory announced on Monday that the two elements, with
atomic numbers 118 and 116 on the periodic table, were created in
late April using a cyclotron accelerator to bombard a lead target
with projectiles of krypton atoms. In three of the collisions
observed by the Berkeley team, target and projectile atoms fused to
form gigantic atoms with nuclei containing 118 protons and 175
neutrons.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the atoms of Element 118 survived for less than 1/10,000
of a second before decaying radioactively into an atom of a second
new element, Element 116, with 116 protons and 173 neutrons in its
nucleus.
</P>
<P>
   Until this experiment, the fusion route by which Element 118 was
created was considered impossible by most of the scientists
involved in heavy-element research, including those at Germany's
Society for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt (GSI) and Russia's
Joint Institute for Nuclear Research at Dubna.
</P>
<P>
   However, a young Polish theorist, Dr. Robert Smolanczuk, made a
series of calculations from which he concluded that a
lead-and-krypton collision technique could produce the desired
element.
</P>
<P>
   ``But no one, including the people at GSI where Robert was
working, believed it,'' said Al Ghiorso of the Berkeley laboratory,
who is himself one of the world's leading discoverers of new
elements.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Darleane Hoffman, a professor at the Berkeley laboratory and
one of the 15 scientists listed as codiscoverers of Element 118,
said in an interview that Dr. Smolanczuk had approached her asking
to join the Berkeley team. ``I didn't have any money to employ him,
but he had been awarded a Fulbright scholarship to pay his way,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Smolanczuk's calculations were at odds with prevailing
theories of possible routes to heavy artificial elements, the
Berkeley laboratory resolved to try them out, using krypton atoms
containing 86 protons to bombard lead atoms with 208 protons. A
special detector, the design for which was proposed by Ghiorso,
measured the debris produced when a single ephemeral atom of
Element 118 decayed in a characteristic way.
</P>
<P>
   The Berkeley experimental team, headed by Dr. Kenneth Gregorich,
measured the atom's decay into Element 116, then 114, then 112 and
on down to 106 _ an artificial element that was recently named
seaborgium in honor of the late Dr. Glenn Seaborg, the chemist who
discovered plutonium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such a surprise that we couldn't believe it at first,''
Ghiorso said. ``Robert Smolanczuk's calculations were verified
almost perfectly. The results are out today and seem to be causing
a lot of excitement. Already the GSI laboratory in Germany has
started an experiment to confirm our result.''
</P>
<P>
   All elements containing more than the 92 protons in the nucleus
of a uranium atom are called ``transuranic'' elements, and none
exists in nature in appreciable quantities. Most are so radioactive
that they decay swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   Some have practical uses. Plutonium fuels nuclear weapons.
Americium is used in smoke detectors, and several transuranic
elements are used in nuclear medicine.
</P>
<P>
   But the main interest of nuclear chemists is in discovering just
how far the limits of matter can be pushed. In particular, they
search for ``super-heavy'' elements, including some that may lie in
an ``Island of Stability,'' capable of surviving for relatively
long periods.
</P>
<P>
   Theories of nuclear structure suggest that protons and neutrons
are arrayed in distinct shells within a nucleus. A shell fully
occupied by neutrons or protons is regarded as more stable than an
unfilled shell, and less likely to decay radioactively.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1960s, theorists have predicted that if an atom with
114 protons and about 184 neutrons could be packed together without
shaking itself to pieces, it might prove to be fairly stable. Last
January, Russian scientists and the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory in California said that they had created this element,
which reportedly survived for about 30 seconds _ a very long time,
by transuranic standards. Efforts are being made to confirm the
scientists claims.
</P>
<P>
   Although Elements 118 and 116 survive only very briefly, their
lifetimes are still longer than would be the case outside the
Island of Stability. One theoretical prediction is that Element
126, if it could be created, might be especially stable. Dr.
Hoffman and Ghiorso said they intended to try for 126 soon, drawing
from Smolanczuk's calculations and bombarding a lead target with
ruthenium atoms. They will also attempt to fill in some blanks in
the sequence of elements in the periodic table, using a bismuth
target to create Element 119. This would presumably decay by
emitting a helium nucleus containing two protons. That would yield
Element 117, which in turn would decay to Elements 115 and 113.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our unexpected success in producing these superheavy elements
opens up a whole new world of possibilities using similar
reactions,'' Gregorich said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the new elements, those higher than 109 have yet to be
formally named. Dr. Hoffman said on Tuesday that she intended to
propose Ghiorso's name for one of them _ ``ghiorsium.'' Ghiorso was
the designer of many of the machines that created new elements and
was a codiscoverer of a dozen artificial elements.

STUDY DOWNPLAYS LINK BETWEEN ESTROGEN REPLACEMENT AND BREAST
CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether to take estrogen or not is the dilemma faced by millions
of women at menopause who want the hormone's protection against
heart disease and osteoporosis, and yet fear that it may also
increase their risk of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   A new study of 37,105 women offers some reassurance, finding
little evidence to link hormone replacement with the most common
types of breast cancer, known as ductal carcinoma in situ or
invasive ductal or lobular cancer. Ductal and lobular tumors
account for 85 percent to 90 percent of all invasive breast
cancers.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers did find an increased risk of other, less common
types of breast cancer in women who took estrogen. But they said
that finding was not completely discouraging, because the types of
cancer they found have a better outlook, respond well to treatment
and are less likely to spread around the body than the more common
forms. The less risky types are called medullary, papillary,
tubular and mucinous tumors.
</P>
<P>
   Some other researchers questioned the findings; but most agreed
that the new study would not resolve the vexing questions for
women. It adds one more page to a catalog of earlier studies that
had mixed results, with most showing no link between hormone
replacement and breast cancer, and a few finding a small increased
risk.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas Sellers, an author of the study and a professor of
epidemiology and associate director of the Mayo Clinic Cancer
Center in Rochester, Minn., said the findings indicate that,
overall, the benefits of hormone treatment outweigh the risks. In
addition to protecting against heart disease and brittle bones,
estrogen prevents hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause, and
may help preserve mental sharpness as well.
</P>
<P>
   The other authors of the study were Dr. Susan Gapstur and Dr.
Monica Morrow of the Northwestern University Medical School. Their
article is being published on Wednesday in the Journal of the
American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   But Sellers emphasized that the study did not determine whether
the benefits of treatment also outweighed risks for women who have
a high risk of breast cancer because of a strong family history of
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Patricia Ganz, a cancer researcher and clinician at the
Jonsson Cancer Center at the University of California at Los
Angeles, said that the study would not change the advice that
doctors give to high risk women or those who have already had
breast cancer. Dr. Ganz said it was not clear that estrogen was
risk-free for those women, and she tended to recommend other
medications to prevent heart disease, osteoporosis and menopause
symptoms, resorting to estrogen only if problems were severe and
the other drugs did not work.
</P>
<P>
   Another expert not involved in the study, Dr. Kathy Helzlsouer,
director of breast and ovarian surveillance at the cancer center at
Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, called the study well
designed and said it suggested that if there was any risk of breast
cancer from the hormones, that risk would be quite small.
</P>
<P>
   ``From that standpoint it is reassuring,'' she said. ``But it
really needs to be replicated.'' She said the number of the less
risky cancers in the study, 82, was very small, and further studies
were needed to determine whether the finding would hold up.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Trudy Busch, an epidemiologist at the University of Maryland
School of Medicine in Baltimore, wrote an editorial accompanying
the journal article, noting that the most important conclusion was
the lack of any connection between hormone replacement therapy and
the most common forms of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've gone kind of overboard on this estrogen-breast
cancer thing,'' Dr. Busch said in a telephone interview. ``We've
been looking for a connection for 50 years, and it doesn't show up.
Overall, there's nothing here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Larry Norton, chief of medical oncology at Memorial
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said the study did not
justify a blanket endorsement of estrogen replacement. The types of
tumors linked to the treatment tend to be stimulated by estrogen,
he said, ``and it is sensible that estrogen use will increase their
incidence.'' Although it is true that those uncommon tumors have
historically had a better prognosis than other types of breast
cancer, he said it could not be assumed that the prognosis would be
equally favorable in a woman taking estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   The study is one of the few to break down cases of breast cancer
by type, rather than grouping them all together.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, there have been dozens of studies looking at the
risk of breast cancer associated with hormone replacement
therapy,'' Sellers said. ``If you look at all the data, there is a
slight risk, perhaps 30 percent. But that's treating breast cancer
as a single disease. What we have done in this study is to take
what clinicians have long known about breast cancer, that it
doesn't always behave the same.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, the Iowa Women's Health Study, conducted from 1986 to
1996, followed 37,105 women who were 55 to 69 years old in 1986.
About 40 percent of the women had taken hormone replacement
therapy. In the entire group, there were 1,520 cases of breast
cancer. Among women who had ever taken hormone replacement therapy,
the researchers found no increased risk of the more common types of
breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But the risk of the less common, less dangerous cancers was
increased. Women who had taken estrogen for five or fewer years had
an 81 percent increase in risk over those who had not taken it, and
those who had used it five years or longer had an increase of 265
percent. The figures were adjusted to take age into account, so
that the greater risk with longer use was not a reflection of
higher risk among older women in general.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said they could not explain why hormone use
should be associated with some types of cancers and not others.
</P>
<P>
   The findings do suggest that replacement therapy is safe for
many women, Sellers said. ``But it's easy for me as a scientist and
a male to say that,'' he said. ``It's really a personal decision.
One in two women in this country die of heart disease, but if you
ask their greatest fear, it's breast cancer. The individual's
perception of risk is paramount.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, his mother asked his advice about starting hormone
replacement, and, Sellers said, ``I told her to go for it.''

 &HT;    Georgia theater owners vow to police underaged moviegoers
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Young teens aching to see the new R-rated ``South
Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut'' debuting later this month will
likely find it harder to get a seat following Tuesday's pledge by
most of the nation's theaters to require photo IDs for admission to
restricted movies.
</P>
<P>
   Several metro Atlanta theater chains said they would step up
policing of admissions to current R-rated films like ``The
Matrix,'' ``Election'' and ``Trippin'.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often children do get past the ticket counter unescorted
and underage,'' President Clinton said in Washington as the
National Association of Theater Owners announced its photo
identification pledge. ``The theater owners are clearly drawing the
line.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're going to see a much more concerted effort to do
a better job (at policing),'' said Phil Zacheretti, vice president
of marketing and advertising for Regal Cinemas. ``We're going to do
more staff training, more emphasis on what we've already been
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had earlier challenged the movie industry to enforce its
rating system more strictly in the wake of the high school
shootings in Littleton, Colo., and Conyers. The president denied
the move was precipitated by hesitancy among Hollywood executives
to embrace his call to reduce violent content in films, and
predicted they eventually will join his crusade.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we all work at it . . . so that nobody's pointing a finger
at anybody else, I think we'll have good participation from the
entertainment community,'' Clinton said. ``I'll be surprised if we
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   The theater owners group, which represents about 65 percent of
the movie screens in the United States, said theaters would display
posters at their box offices informing customers that every young
person who comes to see an R-rated movie will be asked to show a
photo ID.
</P>
<P>
   Parents who want their children under 17 to see an R-rated movie
will still be able to buy tickets and escort them into theaters,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sort of surprised that I have 65 to 70 calls from the
media about this,'' said Brian Callaghan, manager of communications
for General Cinemas. ``It's pretty much the policy we have enforced
for years.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that General Cinemas would ``redouble our efforts
by checking auditoriums, by checking IDs.'' And his chain is well
aware of a common youth practice _ buying a ticket to a lower-rated
movie and then heading to an R-rated screening.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got a group of 15-year-olds buying tickets to a
G-movie late on a Friday night, it raises eyebrows,'' Callaghan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Chain representatives were quick to admit that sometimes younger
patrons do buy tickets to R-rated movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to say that never happens,'' Zacheretti said.
Decisions on who gets carded are often made at the box office and
are subjective.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may let a 15-year-old go by who looks 19, but you do the
very best you can,'' Zacheretti said.
</P>
<P>
   While nearly all chains have an age checkpoint at the box
office, additional policing varies widely.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Theatre Company rechecks ages in the lobby ticket-taking
area and has staffers patrol theaters and look at the audience,
according to chain president Bill Stembler. He is also considering
instituting a parental consent form for those parents who would
allow their underage kids to see R-rated movies unaccompanied.
</P>
<P>
   AMC Theatres' Brenda Nolte says her chain has two secret
checkpoints beyond the box office. She also maintains AMC has been
in compliance with the policy since 1968.
</P>
<P>
   At Regal, ushers are not posted routinely at theater doors to
recheck ages, but staffers do patrol screening rooms and will
question patrons who look under age.
</P>
<P>
   Other chains weren't as quick to jump on board Tuesday's
bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it as a problem currently,'' said Phil Smitely,
director of marketing for Columbus, Ga.-based Carmike Cinemas,
which is not a member of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always had a policy adhering to film ratings and we
try to police it as best we can,'' Smitely said. ``It is the
discretion of the theater manager (whether to ask for a photo ID).
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll look at what NATO is proposing and if it's something we
want to adopt, we will address it at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO said theater owners also pledged to undertake a national
community education effort to develop additional programs to
enhance the ability of parents to make decisions on what movies
their kids can see. And NATO endorsed the idea of a national study
of youth violence.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has directed the surgeon general to compile a report on
youth violence by next year.

HEAT CAUSES PRICES ON SPOT MARKET TO SOAR 
</HEADLINE>
 ENGLAND-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prices on New England's new spot market for electricity soared
to 30 times the normal levels for a second day in a row Tuesday as
sweltering heat drove huge demand for air conditioning and
refrigeration and raised the risk of rolling blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   But while the offering price for one megawatt-hour of power hit
$1,003 Tuesday morning _ compared to $20 to $30 on a normal day _
industry officials stressed that typical consumers will see
virtually no impact on their June electric bills.
</P>
<P>
   The people getting killed _ and making a killing _ on the
month-old New England spot market for electricity were huge
generating companies, electricity brokers, and speculators. And
some of the prices may be ordered reduced by ISO New England, the
Holyoke nonprofit company that runs the power auction for the
six-state region and can act to prevent gouging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Murphy at 222 Elm Street or even a large industrial
customer isn't affected by this at all,'' said Neal B. Costello,
general counsel to the Competitive Power Coalition, a Boston group
that represents plant owners selling to the grid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emphatic answer to the question is: The retail customer
does not pay,'' Costello said. ``It's the wholesale middlemen who
are at risk. They fully know what the risks are, and it really is
capitalism at its best.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston Edison, for example, buys all power for its 550,000
customers under a long-term, fixed-price contract with Select
Energy, a subisidary of Northeast Utilities, said Edison spokesman
Michael Monahan.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, ComEnergy, serving 360,000 homes and businesses in a
region that includes Cambridge, New Bedford, and Cape Cod, gets
``100 percent under contracts. We don't buy power on the spot
market,'' said spokesman Peter A. Dimond.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, on a typical day, about 88 percent of power moving
through the New England grid has been paid for on a fixed-price
contract, and 12 percent is being purchased on the spot market,
said Jim Sinclair, a spokesman for the ISO group.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new wholesale auction market that began May 1 in New
England, who is buying and selling power at what price is now a
closely guarded trade secret, and efforts to learn who was paying
and getting the huge prices were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the big players in the trading market are known to
include Enron, Select Energy, and Southern Energy, as well as a
host of energy brokerages. They guarantee to provide certain levels
of power to utilities or big producers and then play the market to
get the best price, bearing risk when the supply-demand curve
drives prices through the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two days, an unexpected heat wave combined with
reduced generating capacity pushed demand for electricity almost
past what the New England grid can supply. A half-dozen of the
largest of the region's 330 plants are off line for scheduled
service, but additional power is also available from connections to
the New York and Canadian grids.
</P>
<P>
   ISO New England officials threatened to impose two-hour rolling
blackouts Tuesday morning, but backed off after voluntary
conservation efforts _ including a state government shutdown in
Massachusetts _ eased demand to safe levels.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new system, ISO New England each day takes
hour-by-hour bids to supply the next day's spot-market power needs
and takes bidders from cheapest to most expensive, paying all spot
bidders the highest bid price each hour. Fixed-contract prices,
however, do not fluctuate with the market.
</P>
<P>
   As demand rises to levels nearly exceeding supply, the ISO has
to start accepting bids from, for example, plant owners who have
offered to turn on an ancient generator only for a huge price or
from speculators who offer to sell their last few megawatts at a
gigantic premium.
</P>
<P>
   Costello said that despite what may look like ``profiteering''
by companies taking advantage of a regional energy crisis, ``from a
consumer standpoint, it's more important to ask what is an average
yearly price'' for electricity.

TEAM REPORTS PROGRESS ON LUXURY-SEAT SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New England Patriots have sold 43 of the 80 luxury suites in
a proposed stadium in Foxborough, with about $80 million already
committed to the premium seats over the first decade the facility
is open.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than half of the seats are already sold, and that's the
fastest, that we are aware of, for any new stadium,'' said Paul
Tagliabue, commissioner of the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue and local business officials leading the push to help
the Patriots sell the luxury suites announced the status of the
sales Tuesday, after unveiling a preliminary artist's sketch of the
proposed 68,000-seat stadium.
</P>
<P>
   While the rendering revealed little about the construction
plans, the brick-and-steel design appears to have a retro flavor.
The architect, HOK Sport in Kansas City, Mo., is in the early
stages of the design.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the stadium would be built to optimize prime
</P>
<P>
   views, with a comparatively high proportion of seats, about 80
percent, along the sidelines, as opposed to the end zones.
</P>
<P>
   The 80 luxury suites would seat about 2,000 people and provide
amenities like bars, restrooms, private food services, and
televisions. All of the suites would be larger than the 42 suites
at Foxboro Stadium, and the eight largest, at about 1,800 square
feet, would be among the most spacious in the NFL. Suite owners,
who will pay $85,000 to $325,000 per season, would have designated
parking with entrances and exits designed to substantially shorten
the ride home.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots games would be the only admissions included in the
luxury suite deals. Owners would have to pay for admission to New
England Revolution games, concerts, and other events.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury suite owners are required to buy the suites for 10 years,
and are being asked to pay deposits as high as $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The new stadium also would have 6,000 club seats. The current
Foxboro Stadium has none. Officials said those customers would be
served by a lounge running the length of the stadium, with
televisions and large windows facing the field to allow fans to
watch the game when they leave their seats.
</P>
<P>
   No prices for the club seats or the 60,000 regular admission
seats have been determined, Patriots and NFL officials said. ``The
Patriots tickets have always been in about the middle of the ticket
prices around the NFL, and we expect that will continue,'' said
Patriots spokesman Stacey James.
</P>
<P>
   Team owner Robert Kraft, vice president Jonathan Kraft,
quarterback Drew Bledsoe, commissioner Tagliabue, BankBoston CEO
Charles ``Chad'' Gifford, and John J. Connors, chairman of Hill
Holliday Connors Cosmopulos, all spoke to representatives of 50
businesses at a breakfast meeting at BankBoston headquarters
Tuesday, hoping to spur suite sales.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe, who reportedly will earn $7 million next season and $8
million in 2000, later vowed to buy a luxury suite, joking that he
had a compelling, personal reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife won't have to listen to the comments when I throw an
interception,'' he quipped.
</P>
<P>
   The early luxury suite sales will provide a key source of
revenue for Kraft, who walked away from a deal to publicly finance
a stadium in Hartford earlier this year. Kraft is paying the $285
million construction cost, while the state pays for $70 million in
infrastructure improvements around the stadium. The NFL will loan
him $141 million for the construction, and allow him to repay that
amount from the share of the club seats that is normally given to
the visiting teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly looks like businesses are stepping up to the
plate, and we hope more businesses will buy into the luxury
seats,'' said Governor Paul Cellucci, who attended the meeting. The
level of business support, along with approval from municipal
officials in Foxborough, are the only remaining issues, Cellucci
said.

ADVERTISING COLUMN: FORBES PUSHES ITS WEB SITE, WITH ATTITUDE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ga., Mass., Mich., Calif., N.Y., Wash.)  (jw) 
 By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To put its two-year-old World Wide Web site on the map, Forbes
Inc. is waging its biggest ad campaign ever.
</P>
<P>
   The privately held publishing company plans to spend $10 million
on the campaign for forbes.com, the most it has ever spent on any
campaign, through the end of the year. The campaign, created by
Merkley Newman Harty, a unit of Omnicom Group, is intended
primarily to increase traffic on the site and, ultimately,
advertising sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel this is a real opportunity for us to grow the site and
revenues,'' said Gregory Zorthian, vice president for business
development at Forbes and the acting chief executive of forbes.com.
``If we wait six months, others might do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to grow the brand fast,'' added Bruce Rogers, vice
president for marketing communications at Forbes. ``The time span
to build a brand on the Web is different. The life span of a Web
entity is shortened because there's so much competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Its promoters say Forbes.com, which includes original editorial
material as well as electronic versions of articles appearing in
Forbes' flagship business magazine and other supplements, is
building a robust audience. According to Zorthian, the site logged
2.5 million visits in May, compared with 1.6 million visits in the
month a year earlier. The site's year-to-date advertising revenue _
for advertising that has either appeared or been ordered _ is 2{
times that generated in all of 1998, he said. Sponsors include Sun
Microsystems, Gateway, MCI Worldcom and Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   Zorthian also said the site had been profitable for several
months last year and several months so far this year, but that it
was not turning a profit now.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the record budget, Merkley Newman Harty's campaign for
the site differs from its traditional advertising for Forbes in
several ways. It is the first Forbes campaign geared to consumers _
all previous campaigns have been directed at potential advertisers
and their agencies. The campaign is also using radio for the first
time, devoting about a third of its budget to it.
</P>
<P>
   The new campaign's target audience also differs from that for
Forbes magazine because an estimated 80 percent to 90 percent of
visitors to forbes.com do not subscribe to Forbes and its two
supplements, the lifestyle-oriented Forbes FYI, and the
technology-oriented Forbes ASAP.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a younger, knowing kind of audience that's
technologically savvy, entrepreneurial, investment-minded and
comfortable with the Web,'' said Susan Popper, a group account
director at Merkley Newman Harty.
</P>
<P>
   To reach this audience, a series of three 60-second radio spots
are running, mostly during drive time, in seven large markets where
the site already has a strong following: Atlanta, Boston, Detroit,
Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Intended to sound like public service announcements, the ads
feature folksy guitar music and an unctuous male announcer who
describes people who have become wealthy through the Web. One,
Jimmy, is a high school student who used a computer he received for
Christmas to create a Web site ``some big company bought,'' making
him ``disgustingly wealthy.'' Another is Sandy, a young mother
raising three children who designed ``an amazingly successful Web
site and got ridiculously wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   All the ads end by saying that forbes.com provides
``uncompromising views and opinions,'' and telling listeners:
``We're here to help. Forbes.com. It's a new game.''
</P>
<P>
   The print part of the campaign is made up of three ads whose
graphics and copy maintain the cheeky, cynical tone of the radio
spots, as well as the tagline.
</P>
<P>
   One features a fashionably punk young woman, described as a
``college-quitting, credit card-maxing, $23 million stock
option-owning retiree.'' Another shows a scruffy-looking young man,
who it says is a ``no-salary-earning, old underpants-wearing,
billionaire on paper CEO.''
</P>
<P>
   The third features a smirking youth wearing his baseball cap
backward: a ``21-year-old, pizza-eating, parent-mocking, software
company-owning capitalist pig.''
</P>
<P>
   The print ads are running on buses in the seven radio markets;
on billboards in San Francisco; on taxi tops, newsstands and
construction site posters in New York; in magazines like Fast
Company, Red Herring, Wired and Business 2.0; and in advertising
trade publications.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nail, a senior analyst for Forrester Research in Cambridge,
Mass., praised Forbes' efforts to ``give the site a completely
different personality than the magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional Forbes audience is older, higher up, of
limited size,'' he said. ``They're trying to break out of the
mold.''
</P>
<P>
   Nail also commended Forbes for using drive-time radio, which he
called a potentially ``very effective medium,'' but warned that the
site faced steep competitive challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dowjones.com just launched, and Wall Street Journal
Interactive is very successful,'' he said. ``Their other big
competitors are portals like Yahoo, MSN and Excite. People at work
use portals to get their basic business information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forbes definitely will drive traffic to the site and raise its
profile, but $10 million is a lot of dough,'' he said. ``I doubt
they're going to generate enough more advertising revenue to pay
this back any time soon.''

 &HT;    Falcons coach reflects on new life after heart surgeryBy Matt
Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dan Reeves still gets emotional thinking about the
open-heart surgery that saved his life last December, but it was
hard to tell that Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As Reeves made his way through the areas of Piedmont Hospital
where he underwent surgery and began his recovery, he smiled a lot.
Several patients were clearly happy to see him. Reeves seemed
pleased as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can beat a heart attack, you can win the Super Bowl,''
said Lilburn's Charles Doss, who had open-heart surgery a couple of
days earlier. ``I may not win a Super Bowl, but I'm glad you beat
the heart attack,'' Reeves said, chuckling. ``That's much more
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Given what he went through last winter _ in the middle of the
Falcons' drive to Super Bowl XXXIII _ Reeves said Tuesday that his
idea of what is important has changed. After visiting about a dozen
patients and some of the nurses who cared for him last winter,
Reeves, his cardiologist, Dr. Charlie Brown, and his internist, Dr.
Charles Harrison, spoke to an auditorium of about 150 people about
coronary heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll always have this disease,'' said Reeves, who will visit
eight hospitals around the country to talk about his experiences,
advise how to heed warning signals, and tell how to recover from
heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I want (heart patients) to know they can lead a normal
life. You've got to have goals.''
</P>
<P>
   By reducing his fat intake and exercising, Reeves said, his life
has returned nearly to normal.
</P>
<P>
   He's lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Coronary heart disease is the largest killer of American men and
women, and Brown said about one-third of the 1.1 million Americans
who will have heart attacks this year will die from them.
</P>
<P>
   Other times, people have symptoms like those Reeves ignored for
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He had tightness in his chest, and a burning sensation in his
throat for several weeks. Only after it worsened after a Dec. 13
victory at New Orleans did he say anything. He was in surgery the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   Brown noted that people are more likely to have heart trouble if
they have bad cholesterol levels, weight problems, family history
of heart disease and diabetes. It also is more likely for men over
45 and women over 55.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the December news conference, in which Reeves had to
pause several times to gather himself, it happened only once
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He recovered quickly and said he also is trying to reduce the
stress in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Wife) Pam made me promise to take four (long weekends), and
we've taken two. And she's learning to golf with me,'' he said.
``I've also tried to narrow my vision just to tomorrow rather than
the big picture, which can be overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm also delegating more. Obviously, my coaching staff is very
capable; look what the team did when I was out (winning the final
two games of the regular season). This is the beginning of your
life, not the end.''

an end to the Kosovo war, leaves plenty of unanswered questions, as
well as some possible loopholes for Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to exploit.
</P>
<P>
   In a war increasingly defined as fought to return the more than
one million refugees driven out of Kosovo, the draft resolution is
vague about how that goal will be accomplished. Other unresolved
issues include the composition of the international security force
that is supposed to enter Kosovo in the wake of retreating Yugoslav
troops; the role of Russian soldiers in that force, and the
disarming of an increasingly cocky Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   A conflict over the return of the refugees broke into the open
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav foreign ministry spokesman, Nebojsa Vujovic, wasted
no time saying that Yugsolav and Serb guards and customs officials
would be at the borders to monitor the return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   In the peace terms that Milosevic agreed to, which became Annex
2 of the Security Council resolution, an agreed number of Yugoslav
and Serbian personnel are allowed to ``maintain a presence at key
border crossings.''
</P>
<P>
   Such monitoring could scare away many refugees, many of whom
watched Serb forces and paramilitaries kill, beat or harass family
members. Many of the refugees had their documents, birth and
marriage certificates destroyed by the Serbs before they were
forced to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said that refugees in Macedonia and Albania had been
issued new identity papers by the U.N. high commissioner for
refugees. A ``few symbolic'' border guards would have no right to
inhibit their safe passage back to Kosovo, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said Tuesday that the refugees' return was
not primarily a NATO problem, but would instead be handled by
civilian authorities the Commissioner for Refugees is the agency
mentioned in the annex to the resolution. But the agency may well
need military backup to ensure the refugees' safety.
</P>
<P>
   For a leader whose country has been on the receiving end of more
than 10 weeks of air bombardment and who apparently acquiesced to a
peace plan last week, Milosevic is still able to wield influence.
</P>
<P>
   By having his generals insist this past weekend that they would
not negotiate with NATO on withdrawal arrangements until the
Security Council draft resolution was drawn up, Milosevic was using
the presence of the Russians in the drafting of the resolution to
filter out as much as he could of what he found distasteful. In
some respects, he succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the rush to closure, the Russians were able to keep
any mention of NATO out of the body of the resolution. NATO is
mentioned only in one of two annexes.
</P>
<P>
   In Annex 2, which is an almost total reprint of the accord
Milosevic agreed to last week, paragraph 4 says ``the international
security presence with substantial NATO participation must be
deployed under unified command and control.''
</P>
<P>
   But missing from this annex is a footnote to last week's accord
that further spells out how the security force has ``NATO at the
core.'' The next key sentence from the footnote, ``This in turn
means a unified NATO chain of command under the political control
of the North Atlantic Council in consultation with non-NATO force
contributors,'' is also missing from the annex.
</P>
<P>
   A Clinton administration official traveling with Albright said
that the missing footnote represented NATO's ``internal business.''
The Yugoslavs, the official said, could not dictate how NATO would
form the security force or what command arrangements it would have.
</P>
<P>
   But a senior NATO official involved in the military talks with
the Yugoslavs that stalled last weekend said that Milosevic could
well exploit the absence of detail, balking at any measures that
were not spelled out in the Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is little likelihood that the Serbs are going to sign a
military agreement that goes further than the Security Council
resolution,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution states that Kosovo remains a sovereign part of
Yugoslavia, a factor that still allows Milosevic to decide who
enters Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this rests on a strategic assessment that he is
prepared to withdraw and give up Kosovo. If you have doubts about
that, you will be worried,'' the NATO official added. The doubts
were easy to come by because in the first round of military talks,
the Yugoslavs said they would only draw down to ``peace time''
levels of 15,000 troops.

 COLOGNE, Germany: 15,000 troops. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The role of the Russians in the security force, which is still
to be negotiated, apparently with the return to Moscow this week of
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, was also left unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian defense minister, Igor Sergeyev, said Tuesday that
Russia was ready to send up to 10,000 troops to Kosovo, 3,000 more
than Washington has promised for the 50,000 strong peacekeeping
contingent.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO officials believe this may be a bluff _ Moscow does
not have the money or the means to send these soldiers to Kosovo _
there are concerns about Russia deciding to transfer some of its
troops already serving in Bosnia. The Russians have stipulated one
thing: As in Bosnia, their troops in Kosovo will not be under NATO
command.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Clinton said he did not expect Russian troops to be
under NATO control but expected a similar arrangement to the one in
Bosnia, where Russian peacekeepers work in the American sector and
report to a U.S. general in his capacity as head of American forces
in Europe, rather than his role as NATO's military commander.
</P>
<P>
   The early presence of Russian troops in Kosovo, as virtual
free-lancers outside the control of NATO, could also threaten the
return of ethnic Albanian refugees. The Russians are viewed by the
refugees as Slavic brethren of the Serbs who expelled them.
</P>
<P>
   Further, through the Russians, Milosevic would be in a perfect
position to keep a hold on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He had already started to play that game through the Russian
military attache who was dispatched from Belgrade to attend the
NATO-Yugoslav weekend military talks. Though he was supposed to be
only an observer, the Russian attache sided with Yugoslavs on every
issue, NATO officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO tries to persuade Milosevic's generals to organize an
orderly withdrawal from Kosovo _ or, more accurately, as the
generals await the signal from their ultimate superior, Milosevic,
to leave _ NATO must also consider what to do about the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrilla force has swelled with new recruits in northern
Albania and there are deepening concerns about how to prevent these
men, as well as those left inside Kosovo, from taking revenge on
retreating Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Albright met Tuesday with the political director of the
guerrillas, Hashim Thaci _ with whom she had had less than smooth
relations at the ill-fated Rambouillet talks in February _ and
asked him to control his forces. They must refrain, she said, from
seeking revenge and must disarm..
</P>
<P>
   Thaci, 31, who is now being eyed as the new power in Kosovo,
said his general staff would issue a statement in the coming days,
pledging not to take revenge on the Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   But in the rambunctious world of a guerrilla group that has been
battered by more than two months of fighting the better armed
Serbs, it was not clear that Thaci had the authority or the means
to quell what the Clinton administration fears: the outbreak across
Kosovo of civil wars between elements of an emboldened Kosovo
Liberation Army and Serb forces making their last stand.

RISING LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES DAMPEN SHARES

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Long-term interest rates hit 6 percent for the first
time in more than a year Tuesday after two Federal Reserve
officials made comments that suggested the central bank will raise
interest rates at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates and concern about the outlook for computer
companies helped send stocks lower in what promises to be continued
volatility ahead of the Fed policy meeting. After rising 109.54
points Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 143.74
points, or 1.32 percent, on Tuesday to 10,765.64.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interest rate bell rings louder and stock knees get
weaker,'' said Thomas Galvin, chief investment officer at
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. He thinks interest rates can move
higher and stocks lower between now and the Fed meeting. But he
thinks that good second-quarter earnings reports and getting by the
Fed rate increase will help stocks rally in July.
</P>
<P>
   Before then, investors will have to contend with a Commerce
Department retail sales report Friday that is expected to be strong
and heighten expectations of a Fed rate increase. Then next week
comes the Consumer Price Index for May. If it is even moderately
strong, a rate increase will seem guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   In trading Tuesday, the yield on the 30-year bond slipped back
just under 6 percent at the end of the day, finishing at 5.99
percent, up from 5.96 percent Monday. Six percent is an important
psychological barrier and going through it ought to make investors
worry more in the near term about the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Computer stocks, including IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Intel Corp.,
Cisco Systems and Dell Computer, lead the market lower. A report
from Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette said that sales and profits of PC
makers and software companies would be hurt at the end of the year,
as spending on information technology was reduced as the year 2000
_ and the possible computer problems associated with it _
approached. Many companies appear ready to delay spending not
associated with solving year 2000 problems because they do not want
to implement new programs that might complicate the transition to
the new year.
</P>
<P>
   The technology heavy NASDAQ index dropped 49.65 points or 2
percent, to 2,474.56, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500
stocks fell 17.19 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,317.33.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have been expecting a rate increase since last month,
when it was reported that the April Consumer Price Index jumped
seven tenths of one percent and the Fed then announced that it was
leaning toward raising interest rates to slow growth and curb any
inflationary spurt.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of such a rate increase was not clear. But since then
a series of economic reports, including the May employment report
that was released Friday, have shown that the economy is still
strong and that wage pressures may be growing. And that has pushed
investors to betting that the Fed will act when its meets on June
29 and 30.
</P>
<P>
   And the comments from William Poole, the president of the
Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and Alfred Broaddus, the
president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., were seen
as further confirmation of this view.
</P>
<P>
   At a conference at the Federal Reserve Bank in Boston, Poole
said that he ``would share the view'' that the odds now favor
higher inflation, according to Bloomberg News. According to
Reuters, Poole also said that it is best that Fed policy changes
``do not take the market by surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management,
said, ``There seems to be more hawkish talk coming out of Fed
officials and the market is becoming more convinced that the Fed
will raise interest rates when it meets at the end of June.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are now predicting a quarter-of-a-percentage point
increase in the Fed's interest rate target, which is the interest
charged on overnight loans between banks. The target, known as the
Federal Funds rate, is now 4.75 percent. But based on one barometer
of market sentiment _ the difference between the Fed Funds target
and the yield on the two-year Treasury note _ some investors are
expecting that the Fed will push its target up another quarter of a
percentage point later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Some money managers think that if interest rates push a little
higher it will be time to buy bonds again because they expect the
Fed to succeed in slowing economic growth and curbing inflation, a
fact that would push interest rates lower.
</P>
<P>
   But Steve Holzman, the managing partner of Cypress Funds LLC, a
hedge fund in Los Angeles, is being more cautious. He said that he
wants to see data that confirms the slowdown of the economy before
jumping back in. ``I would rather be in at 5.65 percent,'' he said,
referring to the yield on the 30-year bond, ``based on the fact
that you saw some slowdown than at 5.95'' without that
confirmation.

 &HT;    Master runners race for record book
 &HT;    By Michelle Hiskey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
   ATLANTA _ Note to the Guinness Book of World Records: Make room
for Atlanta's baby-boomer runners.
<P>
   One hundred men, all at least 40 years old, took turns Sunday
running a mile each at Emory University and easily broke the world
record in the 1x100 mile relay for male masters runners. They
finished in 8 hours, 57 minutes and 31 seconds, breaking the old
record by more than 6 1/2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The runners, almost all of whom live in the metro area, averaged
5:23 per mile _ 3.4 seconds faster than the mark set by a team from
Houston. ``There are guys in other cities just as fast or faster,''
one of the relay's organizers, Kirk Rosenbach, 47 of Atlanta, said
Tuesday. ``But the depth here is incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   At 8 a.m., Rosenbach set the pace by running the first mile in
5:18, followed by relay captain Joe Schroeder, 44, of
Lawrenceville, with 5:21. The pair stayed at the track to organize
the field they had recruited for the past 10 months. They had
advertised for runners who could break 5:45, but received such a
response that the qualifying time dropped to 5:31. About 15 runners
were in their 50s, and many hadn't run on an oval track since
high-school days.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbach coordinates the Atlanta Track Club's competitive
masters team and stacked some of his best runners early in the
relay. Six of the first 12 runners ran under 5 minutes, building a
cushion that grew to as much as 7 minutes faster than the old
record pace.
</P>
<P>
   But they weren't the stars. As the temperature rose into the
80s, the less stellar runners in the middle of the relay never
slacked off: 55 of the runners were 5:26 or better. The slowest
mile was 5:56; only eight runners were above 5:39. ``They could
have melted in the afternoon sun,'' Rosenbach said. ``But guy after
guy kept hammering these great miles.''
</P>
<P>
   They had company on the track: One team of women and another of
men of all ages attempted unsuccessfully to break their own 1x100
records.
</P>
<P>
   For the masters men, last year's winner in the Peachtree Road
Race, Dick Buerkle, averaged 5:29 minutes per mile. Buerkle, 51 and
the former holder of the world indoor mile mark, capped off the
relay with a blistering 4:39 mile.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 of the runners stayed and cheered as he blazed around
the track and broke through the ribbon. Then they all took a
victory lap together.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbach still felt a lump in his throat days later. ``This
isn't something someone attempts every day,'' he said. ``It's an
unbelievable amount of work getting that many people together, and
that many fast people together.''

   ATLANTA _ As homecomings go, Fred McGriff's return to Turner
Field was warm _ game time temperature Monday evening: 85 degrees _
and, if not fuzzy, then certainly appreciative. When the Crime Dog
was introduced for his first at-bat, the applause was generous and
peppered with a once-familiar back-beat: the sound of a few fans
barking.
</P>
<P>
   Woof, woof. Welcome back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good,'' said McGriff, after his first game here in a
Tampa Bay Devil Rays uniform. McGriff was the Braves' first baseman
and cleanup hitter from mid-1993 through '97. ``At least until
Smoltz hit the home run. Then, it wasn't too good after that.''
</P>
<P>
   When John Smoltz smacked that three-run homer, it started Tampa
Bay spiraling to yet another loss. The Rays' fourth defeat in a row
was their 13th in the last 15 games. After an 11-7 start, the
second-year expansion team has played .333 (13-26) ball since.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder then that, when asked what he misses about
Atlanta, McGriff grinned and replied, ``I miss winning all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss the guys,'' he added. ``I had good times here. There's
a lot of memories. The World Series. Great years. Great fans.''
</P>
<P>
   So not even another night of devilishly bad Rays baseball could
ruin McGriff's homecoming. McGriff, who will turn 36 on Oct. 31,
was back in the city that spawned some of his fondest memories,
particularly the 1995 World Series title.
</P>
<P>
   And this time, unlike three interleague games against Atlanta
last year in Florida, McGriff is far more reminiscent of the power
hitter the Braves acquired in '93, not the 22-homer, supposed
bat-in-decline they sold to Tampa Bay in '97 for a mere $25,000.
They had sent him to his hometown but also to a new team that would
lose 99 games.
</P>
<P>
   Never the most effusive guy, McGriff's bite is once again worse
than his bark. ``I just think Fred McGriff is back to being Fred
McGriff,'' said his manager, Larry Rothschild.
</P>
<P>
   For example:
</P>
<P>
   _ McGriff already has 15 homers, four shy of his total last
year, when his 19 homers led the Rays but were McGriff's fewest in
12 full big-league seasons. His 15th homer came Sunday and gives
him 373 for his career, 43rd all-time and one behind Rocky
Colavito. Last season, McGriff didn't hit No. 14 until Aug. 22 and
broke his string of 11 consecutive 20-homer seasons.
</P>
<P>
   _ McGriff homered in a club-record four straight games May 4-7,
matching the longest such streak of his career, from 1992 with San
Diego. He homered twice against Kansas City on May 5, the 31st
two-homer game of his career. McGriff became the first player to
hit a ball off the roof of the Batter's Eye restaurant beyond
center field in Tropicana Field; that 451-foot blast was outdone by
his 468-footer off the catwalk in center.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seven of McGriff's 15 homers have come on the road, where last
season he hit only five. He's part of the top home-run duo in the
majors with new teammate Jose Canseco, who hit his 22nd on Monday.
One should become the first player to hit 30 homers with four
different teams.
</P>
<P>
   _ McGriff already has 39 runs batted in, after totaling 81 last
season, his fewest since 1987. He has hit safely in 32 of his last
39 games, batting .357 (51 for 143) in that stretch with 12 homers
and 32 RBIs. He's batting .320 overall and is fifth in the AL in
slugging percentage (.637).
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I was human. I wasn't Superman,'' McGriff said.
``This year, I'm fine. I'm getting hits. That's the name of the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   To explain McGriff's resurgence, some people point to off-season
weight work or the running program McGriff began in spring training
and still maintains. Others cite the presence of Canseco, batting
in front of McGriff. The Crime Dog thinks that all of them are,
well, barking up the wrong tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Same ol' same ol','' McGriff said. ``When you're not hitting,
everybody comes up with reasons. When you're hitting, everything is
fine. It's like if (Greg) Maddux is struggling, people gotta have
reasons.'' As for Canseco: ``Jose hits third. I'm protecting him. I
make sure he gets pitches to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Rothschild agrees that there is a marked difference in
McGriff this season. ``He's back on his legs more. He's getting
more drive,'' the manager said. ``Last year, his legs were sore his
calf, nagging injuries. He couldn't get the strength out of them
like he is now. He's balanced, crouched more, knees bent. Before,
he was upright, stiffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he feels better. I think he came into spring training
and right away did a lot of running and got in shape. Looks like
it's paid off for him.''
</P>
<P>
   And could again during the off-season _ McGriff is in the last
year of his contract. ``All I want to do is go out and play,'' he
said. At his pace, who wouldn't?

   LOS ANGELES _ Salads can make substantial and satisfying main
dishes. And with time at a premium for most weeknight cooks,
they're a great, fast solution to the what-to-serve-for-dinner
dilemma. You can whip up a terrific, healthful, alluring and
innovative combination _ full of texture and a tempting variety of
colors and flavors in no time flat _ and often without any cooking
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Main-dish salads can be as substantial and filling as any entree
_ particularly if they contain a cornucopia of protein, assorted
vegetables and greens, fruits or even starches such as potatoes or
pasta. Even better, there are no restrictions or hard and fast
rules. Cooks are limited only by their imagination and image of
what makes a glorious meal.
</P>
<P>
   Also, most entree salads don't require elaborate preparation,
can be assembled at the last minute and be pulled together with
plenty of choices of prepared, store-bought salad-friendly
convenience items like cooked chicken or shrimp or roast beef,
numerous combinations of prewashed and cut-up bagged greens,
spinach or cabbage, cleaned and cut-up bagged veggies (carrots,
broccoli, etc.) or fruits, cut-up or shredded cheeses, cooked
canned beans or corn, jarred artichoke hearts, store-bought
guacamole, salsas, bottled dressings and more.
</P>
<P>
   Today's collection of recipes showcases the ease and diversity
of entree salads. You can choose from a classic Grilled Chicken
Caesar Salad or White Beans With Tuna, or try something more
offbeat like a Thai Cobb Salad, Salmon Salad With Tomato Salsa or
Chicken Salad With Fennel, Orange and Raspberries. Or toss together
a Taco Salad Con Pollo or Southwestern Chicken Black Bean Salad.
</P>
<P>
   If you keep your pantry and fridge stocked with items like
artichoke hearts, tuna, capers, fresh herbs, kalamata olives, feta
cheese, shredded cheese, cooked shrimp, marinated mushrooms,
hard-cooked eggs, assorted leafy greens and lettuce mixtures,
sun-dried tomatoes, roasted red peppers, green peppers, green
onions, peeled garlic and an array of vinegars, olive oils,
mustards and prepared dressings and greens, you can turn out an
interesting and colorful creation at the drop of a hat. Just pick
whatever strikes your fancy and toss together everything in a bowl
with any dressing you choose. Make your own vinaigrette with olive
oil, red or white wine or a little balsamic vinegar, Dijon mustard
and a sprinkling of favorite herbs.
</P>
<P>
   The next time you prepare an entree, consider cooking extra
meat, fish, seafood or poultry so you have leftovers on hand to
whip up an innovative salad within the next night or two.
</P>
<P>
   When selecting greens, the choices these days are mind-boggling.
Select from Boston, iceberg, bibb, romaine or red leaf lettuces,
curly endive, escarole, radicchio, arugula, watercress, spinach,
cabbage and more. Your local farmers' market may offer other
novelty options as well. Be sure the greens are fresh when
purchased _ and avoid those that are limp and bruised. Store
unrinsed greens in plastic bags in the refrigerator until needed.
Rinse in plenty of cold water when ready to use, then blot dry to
remove excess moisture. Plan to use all lettuces within a few days
of buying. Romaine and iceberg are the exceptions as they will
usually keep a week in the fridge.
</P>
<P>
   Use a variety of greens for complementary textures, flavors and
colors and perk up salads with fresh herbs. Experts advise tearing
rather than cutting greens into bite-size pieces. Dress salads just
before serving with only enough dressing to coat the leaves
lightly, not drown them.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a rundown of some spontaneous salad ideas to toss
together when the weather sizzles, or when you want to get dinner
on the table in a jiffy. You'll probably think of many more.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Arrange cut-up fresh fruits on assorted greens and top with
slices of grilled chicken. Pass a curried fruit dressing or sour
cream mixed with orange juice concentrate and a few poppy seeds.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Combine leftover rice with chopped onion, chopped red and
green peppers, green onions, diced cooked chicken or turkey, garlic
pepper, raisins and chopped dried apricots _ and toss with a
store-bought lemon vinaigrette or curry dressing. If you like, add
a sprinkling of chopped fresh or powdered ginger. Serve over
assorted baby greens.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Toss diced cooked chicken with cooked elbow macaroni and
peas, chopped green onions, pickle relish or chopped dill pickles,
low-fat plain yogurt, shredded Cheddar cheese and seasoned salt and
pepper to taste. Serve over bite-size greens.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Mix store-bought pesto with cut-up cooked turkey breast,
chopped tomatoes, chopped green onions, sliced water chestnuts and
a few tablespoons sour cream. Serve over shredded bibb lettuce and
pass extra pesto.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; For an easy rendition of a tostada salad, heat leftover
chili on an individual dinner plate in the microwave oven until
hot. Then top with a mound of shredded iceberg lettuce, shredded
cheese of your choice, chopped tomatoes and sour cream, salsa and
guacamole. Pass Italian or cilantro dressing, if desired.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; A pizza salad in a bowl goes together fast with torn romaine
lettuce, Boboli pizza shells torn or cut into bite-size pieces, a
few tablespoons chopped fresh basil, Italian or french dressing,
chopped salami or pepperoni and shredded mozzarella cheese.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; If you keep a jar of roasted red peppers on hand and pick up
already cooked chicken breast strips at the supermarket, you can
combine them with pimiento-stuffed green olive pieces, drained
capers, ketchup, red wine vinegar, several tablespoons chopped
fresh basil, a dash of sugar, salt and pepper for a wonderful salad
to serve on shredded lettuce.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Diced cooked chicken breast also combines well with a diced
hothouse cucumber, chopped red onion, chopped dill pickles, chopped
celery, whole-grain and Dijon mustards, red wine vinegar, garlic,
oil and salt and pepper for a fabulous salad ideal to serve over
assorted greens.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Another good offering _ this one with Asian overtones _
combines blanched Chinese pea pods, green onions, toasted pecan
halves, shredded cooked chicken breast, vegetable oil, sesame oil,
rice vinegar, soy sauce and Tabasco sauce.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Turn antipasto into a salad by tossing together chopped
tomatoes, green peppers and green onions with thin strips of Genoa
salami, rinsed and drained garbanzo beans, ripe olives, roasted red
pepper pieces, chopped fresh basil and bottled Italian vinaigrette.
Serve on a bed of torn fresh spinach leaves. &QL;
</P>

   WASHINGTON _ House Speaker Dennis Hastert warned his Republican
colleagues Tuesday that the party could lose its majority hold on
Congress in the next election unless they settle differences and
pass major spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinary closed-door meeting with his conference, the
Illinois Republican pleaded for the bickering to end between GOP
moderates and conservatives on a wide range of issues from gun
control and campaign finance reform to pet spending projects that
many members are trying to keep away from the budget ax this year.
</P>
<P>
   The internal bickering over matters large and petty, Hastert was
quoted at telling his colleagues, has kept Congress from moving all
but one of the 13 major spending bills that have to be passed by
Oct. 1 to keep the government operating. Failure to move quickly,
Hastert reportedly said, will allow Democrats to label the GOP as
the ``do-nothing'' majority just at the 2000 campaigns are
beginning to gear up this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert later told reporters that his message to the GOP
conference was ``we ... either hang together or hang separately.''
</P>
<P>
   The speaker said he was encouraged by the response to his
rallying call. ``I can report that as a conference, we're
together,'' he said. ``We're united. We're standing to balance the
budget. We are a part of fiscal restraint.''
</P>
<P>
   That may have been the case in 1994 when they first took control
of Congress. But Republicans of all political ranks and persuasions
have done as much as Democrats over the past year to pad out
certain spending bills to satisfy their own constituencies. They
have also split their conference apart over a number of issues,
including the war in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the war, Hastert failed to rally support among
Republicans for a crucial vote last month backing the allied
bombing campaign and stood by as House Majority Whip Tom DeLay,
R-Texas, lobbied members on the floor, who had already voted in
favor of it, to change their votes.
</P>
<P>
   Republican members later complained that the two GOP leaders
looked like they were were working against each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hastert didn't say so in the meeting this morning, but I think
he's a little disappointed in the way Tom has handled some
things,'' said one Republican member close to both men. ``But the
speaker knows, too, that he's got to step out there and lead before
we'll pick up and follow. And I don't think he's done that
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to offering a plan aimed at bringing Republicans
together on spending bills, Hastert is trying to rally Republicans
behind a series of modest gun-control measures that the House may
vote on next week. After watching Senate Republicans get criticized
by the public last month for trying to head off a series of
amendments designed to strengthen gun-control laws in the wake of
the Colorado high school tragedy, Hastert said the House leadership
would not make the same mistake again.
</P>
<P>
   But House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, announced Tuesday
that neither Democrats nor Republicans would be allowed to amend
the gun-control measures in House Judiciary Committee hearings
dealing with a juvenile crime bill.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement surprised Republicans and Democrats. Committee
Chairman Henry Hyde had scheduled hearings for that purpose, and
committee Democrats called a news conference to denounce Republican
leaders as little more than ``marionettes'' of the National Rifle
Association. The NRA, which opposes the Senate-passed measures
requiring background checks on gun buyers at gun shows and pawn
shops, has been lobbying Republican members hard over the Memorial
Day recess in hopes of derailing the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Armey suggested that members will get a chance to amend the
gun-control measures when they are brought directly to the floor
next week. But he said it is still unclear just how flexible the
rules for considering the legislation will be or what kind of
changes members will be allowed to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Armey said Republicans would make every effort to
honor ``the speaker's commitment'' to have a full debate on
gun-control issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason the Republicans want to skip the microscope of the
committee process is because they cannot stand the scrutiny while
they are gutting the Senate-passed gun violence amendments,'' said
Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the panel.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Hastert, Hyde also favors tougher gun-control
measures. But he worries that the Senate bills may be doomed in the
House, where conservative Republicans and three dozen Democrats
from mostly southern and rural areas are opposed to any any
legislation that might restrict individual rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a bill that has a future,'' Hyde said, adding that he
might try to change the Senate measures to be more acceptable to
Republican and Democratic members.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert's speech to the Republican conference lasted 15 minutes
by most accounts and centered on the urgency of passing all
spending measures before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct.
1.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a compelling argument that if we want to stay the
majority (party), we've got to act like the governing party,'' said
Rep. Ray LaHood of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Hastert proposed shifting some funding from
defense and other big appropriations measures to help pay for some
educational, health and other programs that have been earmarked for
cuts by Republicans. He also suggested that the government could
sell off part of the broadcast spectrum to raise billions more to
help Congress stay within its self-imposed budget caps next year.
</P>
<P>
   The caps, if honored, would force Congress to slash government
spending from current levels by some $20 billion. But Republicans
and Democrats are having a hard time keeping the caps agreement
that was reached with the White House in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, DeLay told reporters Tuesday that Republicans are
committed to doing their part to stay within budget limits, despite
the calls by many GOP members for more spending on defense and
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay acknowledged, however, that the leadership's problems in
dealing with the budget are far from over. ``It's going to be a
long, hot summer,'' DeLay told reporters.

 &HT;    Wilkens `wide open' to changes for Hawks
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Lenny Wilkens has come to the conclusion that the
Hawks must upgrade their talent level, even to the point of
considering a shake-up in the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Tanned and upbeat after a short vacation in Seattle, the Hawks
coach touched on the declining play of point guard Mookie Blaylock,
the injuries that disrupted a promising season and his own reaction
to criticism, particularly that dealing with a perceived absence of
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, Wilkens also expressed unbounded optimism for next
season, ``because we finally have a home (in the new Philips Arena)
and because we have the tools to improve our team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be wide open next year. Nobody's guaranteed
anything,'' Wilkens said of the roster, which could have a
significantly new look. The Hawks have four draft picks and can
bring in a veteran under the $4.4 million salary cap exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need good veteran players. We're all on the same page about
that. If you look at the teams that are still playing, you see it's
the veteran players that help you win. We've got young guys, and I
always want to have young guys, but we can't be so young that
everybody's a rookie.''
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of the 32-year-old Blaylock, his starting point
for six years, Wilkens expressed reservations for the first time.
The coach acknowledged the problems presented by a player who
doesn't shoot well (.413 career, .379 this season) but insists on
shooting often and ranked only 20th in assists (5.8 this season).
``That's the area that we have to evaluate very strongly,'' Wilkens
said. ``Whether it's having someone come in who has to play ahead
of him or getting him to the point where he understands he's got to
run the show, find people and think pass first. Not worry about his
scoring. There are enough guys who can score if you just get them
the ball. He should be comfortable enough with his teammates to
understand that.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens is not going to abandon Blaylock, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got off to a slow start _ a lot of guys did _ so he
resorted to the one crutch: `I've got to score some points.' Now,
he's got to run the show, really run the show. If he can do that,
we'll be all right. What's happened is he wants to do it, but when
things go wrong, that (thought) is over.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter who the point guard might be, the Hawks can help him
by adding offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get another guy who can get us points,'' Wilkens
said. ``We can't have Mookie feeling he's the only guy who can
score points.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens said Blaylock felt like he had to score more because of
injuries to Steve Smith, who missed a third of the season with a
sprained knee; LaPhonso Ellis, out the last 60 percent with a torn
stomach muscle, and Alan Henderson, who sat during the playoffs
with a scratched eye that caused double vision. ``I empathize with
him, understanding he knows we need to score,'' Wilkens said.
``But, at the same time, he has to trust the other guys on the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks started out running but evolved into a dull,
half-court team. Wilkens points to the injuries as a culprit but
concedes it's more than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the best features of my teams in Seattle and Cleveland
is that we passed the ball ahead, and that's how we should play
here. We're yelling, `Push it up. Throw it up.' It's not happening.
Toward the end of the year, Dikembe (Mutombo) started to throw the
ball up the floor. With Mookie, once he started shooting poorly, it
reflected on the rest of his game. He wasn't throwing it up. He
didn't trust guys.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the fans, Wilkens said he can understand their
disappointment and that he shares it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to a lot of people and they seemed to know and
understand. You always hear the ones who are unhappy. But I don't
have a problem with that. I'm unhappy. They can't possibly be as
disappointed as I am. I'm the one in the trenches. I wanted to win
so badly because I thought we were capable. The fans are angry. I'm
angry. But you've got to be realistic, too. Our team wasn't 100
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Injuries haven't lessened the heat on the coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking heat goes with the territory. I've gotten used to it a
little. The only time it bothers me is when people don't have the
facts. I know what happened. Pete (Babcock, general manager) knows.
Stan (Kasten, club president) knows. The players know. Radio talk
shows know nothing. We all get a little down. We have our moments.
But I'm an optimist. I bounce back. I'm a tough loser. I don't like
to lose, especially when I think we have an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens is not openly emotional, leading some to believe that he
is a man devoid of passion. He disputes that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players know how upset I get,'' he said. ``I get tired of
explaining myself because I don't yell and I don't kick things
around. That doesn't mean anything. Maybe I should cry. That's
popular. But, hey, a lot of coaches won't show all their emotion.
It doesn't mean we don't get upset, we don't want to win. I'll tell
you something: You can't coach this game and not have it working on
you.''
</P>
<P>
   How does that emotion translate to the players who appear
remarkably detached at times?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not entirely true. I think Smitty is always ready, but
what happens is he gets caught up emotionally. That hurts him. Now,
if I see Dikembe standing around and chatting, I'll say something
to him. I told him, `I love my mother, but if she's on the court
trying to stop me, I'm going to run over her.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens laughs. ``But that's where Grant (Long) is great for us.
Grant is tough, hard-nosed. Every time he steps on the floor, he's
trying to get it done. He was terrific. We need another guy who can
come in and push that attitude among his peers. I don't care what
position it is. But we're going to find that guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Wilkens says he feels good about next season. For
starters, he noted Henderson and Ellis will probably be fully
healed. ``We're going to get better at point guard, whether it's
A.J. (Anthony Johnson) or somebody to help Mookie. We're going to
get another scorer and an inside guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we're going to have a home where we practice, take rehab,
play games, have meetings. Our own place. Don't undersell that.
We'll have a building our guys will be proud of, and that's going
to set a tone.''

 &HT;    Powerful partners to guide Equifax
 &HT;    By Maria Saporta
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Equifax, the financial information services company,
will announce today that Lee Kennedy will be its new president and
chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas F. Chapman, 55, who has held the title of CEO and
president since January 1998, succeeded C.B. ``Jack'' Rogers as
chairman at the Atlanta-based company's annual meeting in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it should not fall on deaf ears that as chairman, my
first act was to give up a title within the first month and bring a
partner in to run the day-to-day operations,'' Chapman said.
</P>
<P>
   The two intend to serve as a management team that will allow
Chapman to focus more on strategy and emerging business
opportunities. Kennedy, who has been executive vice president and
group vice president of Equifax Payment Services in St. Petersburg,
Fla., will become a hands-on manager of the company's existing
businesses in North America, Europe and South America.
</P>
<P>
   Equifax also is operating in a more ``complex environment,''
Chapman said. The 100-year-old company had nearly $1.7 billion in
revenue in 1998. It has 13,000 employees, operations in 18
countries and sales in another 32 international markets.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment also suggests a potential succession plan for
the company. Last October, the Equifax directors met at their first
strategic retreat in 99 years to hear from Chapman about succession
options.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them that if I got hit by a truck or if they canned me,
that Lee was their guy,'' Chapman said. ``I'm not going anywhere,
anytime soon,'' he added quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Does Kennedy have his sights on the top job?
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I haven't thought about it for one second,'' said
Kennedy, 48. ``I'm taking it step by step. I don't know whether I
would want Tom's job in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after joining Equifax in 1990, Chapman said he was
impressed with Kennedy, who was one of the top two executives of
Telecredit, a company Equifax acquired that year.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was running the credit card processing operations for
Telecredit, then considered the ``throw-away'' part of the
acquisition. Chapman, who had been in charge of credit card
processing at First Atlanta in the 1970s, quickly grasped the
potential of the Telecredit acquisition. As soon as he got to know
Kennedy, Chapman recognized that the two had compatible
personalities and business philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lee had a toughness to him, and he was customer driven,''
Chapman said. ``When he said he was going to make his numbers, he
made his numbers.'' After being acquired by Equifax, the card
business at Telecredit jumped from $50 million to nearly $500
million.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman and Kennedy also have become comfortable with each other
in hard times. When Equifax's European business sank in December,
Kennedy was one of the few company executives to call Chapman to
see how he was doing and to help provide support.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who will move to Atlanta from Tampa-St. Pete with his
family later this month, said they share business values, but have
different communication styles _ complementing Chapman's ability to
``paint a whole picture.''
</P>
<P>
   In describing the new team, Chapman explains that he will still
stay close to the business operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really want to go to 50,000 feet.'' Chapman said. But
he also added that ``Lee will do what he wants. I have not been his
daddy up to this point, and I won't be his daddy now.''

 HILLSBORO, Ore.: to research.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   So, in Washington County, where more than 90 percent of its
population of around 400,000 people live within the 15 percent of
the county's land that is inside the growth boundary, the desire to
limit Intel's job growth has some obvious roots.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Intel, who have worked intensively with county
planners over the years on growth issues, even donating land in
order to place a light-rail station near their offices and chip
plants, said they were as concerned as anyone else in the Portland
area with livability. They said they were happy to agree to the
impact fees, though the idea was unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something that's come up in other communities, so
far, anyway,'' said Bill MacKenzie, an Intel spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the annual impact fee would actually be enough to deter
Intel from creating new jobs here is an open question, though, as
another Intel spokesman, Mike Salsgiver, said, ``It certainly could
be a factor. This is a cost-conscious company.''
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, though, the fees have a powerful symbolic value,
and represent a clear attempt on the county's part to set a target
for new jobs, one that the company says is a reasonable one.
Moreover, the impact fees are also a selling point in information
the county administrators have posted on their World Wide Web site
for local residents who have questions about the tax package.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Intel is combining a $12.5 billion investment
and a focus on job retention, not new employment growth, means new
impacts should be minimal to schools and public infrastructure
(roads, sewers, water systems, etc.),'' according to the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, when the state's timber industry had
collapsed and Oregon's unemployment rate soared into the double
digits, the idea of levying ``growth impact fees'' would have been
almost unimaginable. In fact, six years ago, the state kicked off
its Strategic Investment Program, under which Intel has negotiated
this and previous tax breaks, in a determined bid to attract
high-technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   The state has done spectacularly well with its transition from
wood chips to computer chips, and the state's ``Silicon Valley'' is
a large part of the reason that Oregon's unemployment rate is
routinely below the national level, which is itself at historic
lows.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Intel, with 11,000 employees here over all, is the largest
private employer in the state.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The new tax package is intended, state officials say, to help
mitigate a provision in the state tax code that assesses property
taxes on a company's machinery and other equipment as well as its
buildings and land, and thus imposes particular burdens on the
high-technology industry.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of Intel's investments here will be in
equipment, which sometimes needs to be upgraded in a matter of
months to accommodate manufacturing changes in the fast-changing
industry. And as that equipment is increasingly automated, Intel is
unlikely to be creating large numbers of jobs here despite the
billions of dollars it is investing, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With no sales tax, Oregon has a particular reliance on property
taxes, with what critics call a hodge-podge of breaks to go along
with it: until just a few years ago, for instance, the state gave a
tax break for the construction of nuclear fallout shelters.
</P>
<P>
   The critics also question whether the breaks for the technology
industry amount to ``corporate welfare,'' but in many ways, the
deal Washington County worked out looks to be a good one for
taxpayers. It almost certainly averts a possible large-scale
relocation by Intel to Arizona and New Mexico, which have both
beseeched the company to expand operations there, and among other
things, it guarantees the county nearly $30 million in fees
regardless of whether the company makes any new investments here at
all.
</P>
<P>
   And overall, the company's payments to the county will increase
from $12 million last year to an annual average of nearly $20
million.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also has provisions, the county says, to strip away the
growth-impact fees if the economic situation here reverses itself
and the area wants more jobs. For now, though, even many workers
who hold good jobs at Intel said they are just as happy that the
company has disincentives to create too many more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The housing prices, the traffic, it's all going off the
charts,'' said 37-year-old Mark Kent, a technician, as he donned
the protective clothing for his shift at the company's Ronler Acres
chip plant that is designed to keep all impurities away from the
chips and looks a lot like a NASA-style space suit, though it is
more commonly called a ``bunny suit'' at Intel.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll never be able to stop the growth but if this puts it
at a slower pace, that's good,'' Kent said.
</P>
<P>
   And Dave Stegemann, a litho technician who moved here from
Albuquerque a year and a half ago, said he found the idea of
discouraging growth a bit jarring, but only at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unusual, I'd never really heard of that idea before,''
Stegemann said. ``But then I read about it, I thought about it, I
talked to my wife about it, and it seemed like it's a really
innovative approach. I think it's a fair idea. Growth does have
costs.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDWOOD CITY, Calif. _ It is early in the honeymoon for the At
Home Corp., a provider of fast Internet access through cable lines,
and Excite Inc., the country's second-largest Internet portal,
which it just bought for $6.7 billion. But Excite may already feel
like the bride who finds that her in-laws are bent on undermining
the marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the big cable companies that control the newly
combined company are now dropping loud hints that they think the
deal, which they approved, was a mistake _ most notably, Leo
Hindery Jr., who runs the cable operations for AT&AMP;T, owner of 58
percent of the voting shares of what is now called Excite(AT)Home.
Hindery has publicly questioned whether At Home should be so
closely tied to a single source of news, e-mail and other services.
</P>
<P>
   That has been the strategy long articulated by Thomas Jermoluk,
formerly head of At Home and now chief executive of Excite(AT)Home.
His plan is to use fast Internet access to steer users directly to
pages run by Excite, replicating the all-in-one power of America
Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   It is a big challenge to take on America Online, which adds some
600,000 paying customers a month and is planning its own high-speed
service, through telephone wires.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet world is changing, with far faster networks
soon to be hooked up to computers, televisions and all manner of
devices. And with a potential of 65 million homes served by its
cable systems, 26 million current users of Excite and a market
value of $18 billion, Excite(at)Home has as good a chance as any
company to be a contender in this new market.
</P>
<P>
   It does, that is, so long as everybody in the family gets along.
``The biggest threat to At Home now is themselves,'' said Abhi
Chaki, head of broadband consulting at Jupiter Communications, a
market researcher firm in New York. ``There may well be an
implosion.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, since At Home was born in 1995, its cable parents _
primarily At&AMP;T, the Comcast Corp. and Cox Communications _ have
done as much to stunt its growth as to nurture it. They have, for
one thing, been slow to add the capability to handle two-way data
traffic. So At Home, which once promised to have a million
subscribers in its first year, will not reach that milestone until
the end of this year, giving phone companies and satellite
providers the chance to develop rival high-speed technology.
</P>
<P>
   The cable companies gave At Home the right to block any other
provider from using their systems to offer high-speed Internet
access, but that block ends in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Excite(at)Home may be a pawn in its own parents'
bickering. Looking at its board, it is no wonder one cable
executive called it ``the Falcon Crest of Silicon Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   The core is L. John Doerr, the venture capital impresario at
Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, and John Malone, who as chairman
of Tele-Communications Inc. agreed to back Doerr's plan for
high-speed service. Also on the board is C. Michael Armstrong,
chairman of AT&AMP;T, which recently bought TCI, and Brian Roberts,
president of Comcast, which AT&AMP;T just outbid in the takeover battle
for another cable company, MediaOne.
</P>
<P>
   So far, despite the public griping, Jermoluk, known as T.J., has
been able to get the board to back his plan, negotiating deals with
21 cable companies to offer its high-speed service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been really impressed with the force of will that T.J.
has to pull this strange collection of bedfellows into a common
team,'' said Geoffrey Yang, a venture capitalist with Institutional
Venture Partners in Menlo Park, Calif., who served on Excite's
board. ``When you talk to the guys who work at At Home, there is
almost a cult of T.J. To them, he's larger than life.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Jermoluk has to bridge an entirely different culture gap.
For as much as the cable companies see At Home as their prodigal
son hot rodding around Silicon Valley dreaming of being in show
business, to Excite it is a timid Mama's boy. ``The cable
companies, while entrepreneurial, are not necessarily moving at Web
pace,'' Yang said.
</P>
<P>
   Of more concern to At Home's owners is the World Wide Web credo
that a company must dominate a market or die. At Home, typically,
wants every advantage and is trying to lock cable systems into
exclusive deals and funnel users into services on which it controls
the advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The cable companies are used to cozier competition, with system
operators owning pieces of many programming channels. And they are
more used to operating under the watchful eyes of regulators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Left to its own devices, At Home would go and play things up
that have a negative effect on cable,'' said one At Home board
member.
</P>
<P>
   Since the cable companies are spending $5 billion to $10 billion
to upgrade their systems to handle two-way data, they insist that
At Home not appear so monopolistic as to invite new government
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   That is what America Online has been asking for as it complains
bitterly to Washington that the cable systems will not let it buy
broadband access wholesale, bypassing At Home's service. Hindery
has told cable executives that on AT&AMP;T's systems, the country's No.
1 portal, Yahoo, will get equal placement to Excite.
</P>
<P>
   And last week a federal court upheld a rule by Portland, Ore.,
requiring AT&AMP;T's cable system to offer access to other Internet
services.
</P>
<P>
   Jermoluk is quick to point out that At Home users can go
anywhere on the Web. But he says it is essential that the first
screen customers see, with links to news, e-mail, shopping and so
on, be Excite's.
</P>
<P>
   At Home figures it will only break even from its 35 percent of
the monthly fees for its Internet service. (The cable operators
keep the rest of the fee, now about $40.) So advertising must
provide the profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that over time, the revenue from transporting data
will continue to fall,'' Jermoluk said. ``That's why in our
long-term business model, half our revenue comes from the media
side.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts disagree, saying the transporting of data _ which
happens to be what AT&AMP;T and At Home's other parents do for a living
_ can be profitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet access is going to be a commodity,'' said Chaki of
Jupiter. ``But there are still going to be people who make a lot of
money on access. And their whole subscription model is muddled
because they have this media play through Excite.''
</P>
<P>
   If the board didn't agree, though, why did it approve the Excite
deal?
</P>
<P>
   Excite had decided to sell itself because its stock market value
was too low to make big acquisitions, and it feared that it would
fall further behind Yahoo. Ultimately, At Home's board decided it,
too, could best protect its investment by growing. ``Frankly,
Excite isn't Yahoo and At Home isn't AOL,'' said one board member.
``So it was a logical pooling of resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Excite may not quite be Yahoo, but it has come a long way since
it was founded by a group of Stanford University graduate students
in 1995. Running a marathon at the pace of a sprint, Excite
transformed a tiny search engine into a vast portal, a collection
of services from stock quotes to shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never enough time,'' said George Bell, Excite's
chief executive, who is now president of the combined company.
``You worked. It got dark. You woke up. Someone handed you a piece
of pizza and it started all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Excite's breakneck style is far different from the more measured
pace of At Home, which has taken years to prepare for a battle that
could play out over a decade.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise, then, that the two chief executives could
hardly be more different. Jermoluk, a windswept blond from Hawaii,
is an ambitious Silicon Valley engineering executive, known for his
laid-back style and wild office parties. Bell, a sober, dark-haired
New York publishing executive, is just as ambitious, but is known
for hands-on control and long hours.
</P>
<P>
   And while Jermoluk is always the engineer, Bell has far more of
a media perspective. ``T.J. will come in, and if he's feeling
particularly perky, he'll ask about whether we should use an
interrupt model or a polling model to get data from the cable
modems,'' said Adam Grosser, the head of engineering. ``George
wants to know about page views and advertising revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Both executives say that for it to work, the merger must not
hinder Excite's ability to keep up with the other portals. So far,
the combination seems smooth, aided by the coincidence that the two
companies occupy adjacent office buildings here on the northern
edge of Silicon Valley. And since there is little overlap in their
operations, there have been no layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   While it was Jermoluk who offered the No. 2 spot to Bell,
several board members were pleased, hoping Bell's reputation for
detail would help compensate for some gaps in service quality they
attribute to Jermoluk. They also seemed reassured to have a
talented backup to Jermoluk, who, with stock options worth more
than $400 million, may not have a strong incentive to stay on
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Jermoluk says he will stay, though, and there is certainly no
shortage of things that he and Bell say they plan to do. Excite,
for example, will be reformatted to serve users equally well at
slow and fast speeds, offering those on the faster broadband
connections more video and graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Excite's vast marketing data base will also be expanded to
incorporate data from cable set-top boxes, which are really
minicomputers. That way people who watch the Food Channel, for
example, will see ads for frying pans when they later surf the Web.
And any Excite user in an At Home service area will get a barrage
of offers for high-speed access.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has to complete development of its interactive
television service, another project Jermoluk persuaded a skeptical
board to back. He wants to offer news, shopping and Internet
surfing on TV screens, somewhat the way Microsoft Corp.'s WebTV
does. (AT&AMP;T is the only cable company interested so far.)
</P>
<P>
   There is some deal making to do over Road Runner, the rival
cable Internet service started by Time Warner and MediaOne.
Jermoluk has long wanted to buy Road Runner, and some deal is more
likely now that AT&AMP;T is buying Mediaone, and Microsoft, which owns
10 percent of Road Runner, has invested in AT&AMP;T. But some
executives at Time Warner and some of At Home's owners wonder
whether the industry wouldn't be better off with two competing
services.
</P>
<P>
   Even without those deals, Excite(AT)Home will have to complete
its $500 million nationwide backbone network to link the cable
system so it can handle all the customers Jermoluk is expecting. By
2002, he wants 10 million to 15 million subscribers to the Internet
service and 40 million to 50 million people using its interactive
television service.
</P>
<P>
   It is no accident that Jermoluk is tuning his plans to 2002 _
the year the exclusive contracts end and cable operators can sell
access to America Online, Road Runner or anyone else. By that
point, Jermoluk says, Excite's service will be so popular that the
cable systems will want to offer it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is to be a strong enough and powerful enough brand,
like MTV and ESPN, that the cable systems will want to keep working
with us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And ultimately, Jermoluk said, Excite(at)Home has a measure of
protection from too much interference from its meddlesome parents
because they own so much of its stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are a valuable property for them,'' he said, ``why would
they go a different way and throw away their equity value?''

TOP CNN FIGURE IS QUITTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lou Dobbs, one of the most important executives and
on-camera personalities for Cable News Network, is leaving CNN to
start his own Web site, CNN announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of Dobbs, an executive vice president of CNN and
anchor of the financial news show ``Moneyline,'' ends what had
become a somewhat rocky relationship. Staff members at CNN and
CNNfn said that Dobbs had had a number of problems, which one
executive labeled ``creative differences with management,'' and had
clashed recently with Rick Kaplan, the president of CNN, over
pre-emptions of his program for live news coverage and the
allocation of resources.
</P>
<P>
   Losing Dobbs could have serious financial repercussions for CNN.
``Moneyline'' is the most lucrative show on the network in terms of
advertising revenue. It reaches such a concentrated audience of
wealthy investors that it has been able to charge a higher price
for commercials than any other program on CNN, two CNN executives
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dobbs' influence went beyond ``Moneyline.'' He also was in
charge of all the financial news coverage for the network. He
managed a staff of more than 300 people around the world,
supervised all financial news for CNN's Web site and headed all
financial coverage for CNN's international channels. In addition,
Dobbs was the president of CNN's spinoff cable channel for
financial news, CNNfn.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbs is leaving to start a Web site called Space.com, which
will offer news and educational and fictional entertainment content
about space, including science and business content. Dobbs will be
the venture's chairman and have a substantial equity stake, said a
person close to him who spoke on condition of anonymity. The same
person said the venture's primary investor would be Venrock
Associates, the venture capital firm based in New York and
associated with the Rockefeller family.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, CNN's chairman and chief executive, Tom Johnson,
and Dobbs both expressed gratitude and respect for each other. The
parting is effective Friday, and was described in their statement
as ``amicable.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN named two executives to replace Dobbs on an interim basis.
Jeff Gralnick, a longtime news executive at both ABC News and NBC
News who joined CNN in February as the executive producer of CNN
financial news, will continue in that role. David Bohrman, the
executive vice president of CNNfn, will continue to oversee the
cable network. Both will report to Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Senior executives at rival financial news programs called the
blow to CNN a serious one, saying that Dobbs had been the main
reason for the loyal following built up by ``Moneyline.''
</P>
<P>
   But his management role has been equally important, several CNN
executives said. He was considered one of the architects of the
overall Internet strategy for CNN's parent company, Time Warner.
The company had put him in charge of all the financial aspects of
the Internet portal it was designing to cover all its financial
news operations, which included not only CNN but also the magazines
Fortune and Money.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the problems between Dobbs and the management of CNN go
back several years. In 1997, for example, Dobbs threatened to quit
CNN unless CNNfn was expanded to 18 hours a day from 12. CNN
complied.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, in the most public example of differences, Dobbs
feuded on the air with Kaplan after Kaplan made a decision to
pre-empt a portion of ``Moneyline'' last month for a speech by
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The speech came when the president was visiting Littleton,
Colo., after the shootings at Columbine High School. Dobbs made his
displeasure with the decision known when he told viewers that ``CNN
President Rick Kaplan wants us to return to Littleton.''
</P>
<P>
   In subsequent days two memos appeared, the second of which
appeared to be a retraction of the first. The first said that the
CNN management in Atlanta had ``full authority'' to pre-empt
``Moneyline'' for breaking news and that ``violations could result
in demotions or terminations.''
</P>
<P>
   The second memo, three days later, said that Dobbs had the right
to determine when ``Moneyline'' would be interrupted ``whenever
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN staff members said that Dobbs had also protested the
allocation of resources to the news magazine program ``Newsstand,''
which Kaplan created. ``Newsstand'' got off to the rockiest of
possible starts when its first broadcast, about the alleged use of
nerve gas by U.S. forces in Vietnam, was retracted.
</P>
<P>
   But one of Dobbs' associates at CNN said Tuesday that the
conflict with Kaplan was ``a symptom, not the cause, of his
decision to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   The real enticement was the potential for an enormous financial
windfall in the Internet business, this associate said.

ALEXANDER HOPES CHARACTER ISSUE WILL BUY HIM ATTENTION IN
PRESIDENTIAL BID 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARYVILLE, Tenn. _ The last time he ran for president, Lamar
Alexander saw no need to parade before voters his membership in the
elite fellowship of Eagle Scouts. To any son of this modest,
contented hill town, it would have been a vainglorious declaration,
made creaky by the rustle of ancient merit badges.
</P>
<P>
   But this time around, the self-effacement is over, jettisoned
with the flannel shirts and statewide hikes. Suddenly, Alexander
has decided he has every reason to inform voters of his Eagle Scout
award, his impeccable family life, his respectable record as a
two-term governor of Tennessee. Convinced by a year of Washington
scandal that his moment has finally arrived, he does so with little
prompting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in 1974, Ray Blanton beat me by calling me Richard
Nixon's choirboy,'' Alexander said in an interview, referring to
the disgraced former governor of Tennessee. ``But four years later,
after people found out he was selling pardons for cash, they
decided electing a choirboy wouldn't be so bad. And this year,
people are looking for character again. They come up and tell me
they want someone who will restore decency to the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   The personal failings of President Bill Clinton have created a
new theme for Alexander's second presidential campaign, which until
recently had threatened to sound very much like his earnest but
lackluster attempt in 1996. His proposals to decentralize education
and lower taxes, impassioned as they sound, have yet to arouse many
voters, and his fund-raising has fallen so far below expectations
that it is threatening the viability of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He has plowed and seeded Iowa and New Hampshire for seven years,
but much of his organizing work has been washed away by the leading
Republican candidate, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who has
considerably less governmental experience than Alexander but a much
better-known name and his father's prodigious list of contributors.
Many party leaders on whom Alexander had counted have embraced
Bush, who is attracting so many Republican dollars that Alexander's
campaign has been forced to lay off senior staff members just to
stay alive.
</P>
<P>
   And so Alexander is going beyond most of this year's mainstream
challengers in using the Lewinsky scandal and its moral
repercussions as a broad cudgel to batter the Clinton
administration _ and by extension, Vice President Al Gore _ in
diverse areas like Kosovo and Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, he says, has ``destroyed the nation's confidence in its
government'' and squandered the moral authority he needs to wage
war and heal the wounds of the school shooting. Gore, as the
president's ``head cheerleader,'' is no less guilty because of his
supporting and continued praise for Clinton, Alexander said, adding
a compact aphorism: ``He can't take all the credit for Mr.
Clinton's economy and none of the blame for his misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if Alexander's straightbacked persona also presents a
contrast with the dimly lit background of Bush, that won't bother
him a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect all of us in the field will get asked lots of
questions about our background,'' he said, driving a visitor around
the placid neighborhood where he grew up and took piano lessons.
``And I for one intend to answer those questions. I don't expect
I'll have very many to answer.''
</P>
<P>
   He wants desperately to be asked, though, and quickly. As cheery
and confident as Alexander sounds, his campaign is in some danger
of starvation. Though he has stump appeal and one of the best
fund-raisers in the Republican Party, he has not been able to draw
nourishment from the party's donors. The reason might be summed up
in one of the maxims that punctuate his life and fill the
self-deprecating and amusing ``Little Plaid Book'' he published
last year: ``If you want to be noticed, don't ride in a convertible
with Dolly Parton.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, it is Bush who fills the role of the alluring
country siren, and it frustrates Alexander to no end that so many
Republicans are betting on a well-known name. He had hoped to raise
about $7 million by now, but was expected to report less than $2.5
million in his second-quarter filing later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last week, he has been forced to lay off four of his
most senior staff members, including the directors of research,
communications and legal affairs, along with several other workers.
It was a painful admission for a candidate desperate to radiate
confidence and momentum, particularly when he was still trying to
convince his supporters that his single-digit poll ratings meant
nothing at this early stage. Now, he must bet his entire treasury
on the two states with the first voices of 2000, Iowa and New
Hampshire, all the while praying for Bush to bungle his lead.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy remains plausible, however, particularly given
Bush's reticence so far to outline his positions, and in the
absence of any other nationally known, tested Republican in the
race. By most reckonings, the Alexander campaign is the best
organized in Iowa, with most of the county leaders as well as the
popular former governor, Terry Branstad, supporting him. He
announced on Tuesday that he has volunteer organizations set up in
each of the state's 99 counties, more than any of the other
contenders. That actually counts for something in Iowa, where
voters have to be persuaded to come out on a frozen winter night,
but it is hardly a guarantee of eventual success.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been visiting here regularly for the last seven years,
and historically that has made a difference for some candidates who
are not that well known,'' said Hugh Winebrenner, a professor of
public administration at Drake University in Des Moines and author
of a book on the Iowa caucuses. ``The flip side is that he's got to
have some good news at some point, because in the end it's
enthusiasm that puts you over the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander prefers, of course, to take the long view, and
counsels skeptics to ``remember the fable of the tortoise and the
hare.''

CREATING A GREAT PARTY WITH SIMPLE PLEASURES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(HAS ART)  
By NATALIE HAUGHTON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ June is the month to celebrate graduations,
anniversaries and showers with stylish parties.
</P>
<P>
   For memorable festivities, keep the menu simple but
great-tasting, advises Ina Garten, author of ``The Barefoot
Contessa Cookbook'' (Clarkson Potter; $32.50), named after her East
Hampton, N.Y., specialty food takeout store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entertaining is about recess; it's about having fun, not just
for the guests but also for the host. It's about connecting with
friends,'' said Garten, whose book is full of fun party ideas.
``The key to delicious simple food is, of course, to use the best
ingredients.''
</P>
<P>
   To honor new graduates, married couples or the bride-to-be,
Garten suggests a a wonderful outdoor buffet with ham as the
centerpiece and lots of good accompaniments such as grilled and
roasted vegetable platters, assorted salads like Fresh Corn and
Vegetable Coleslaw and fresh fruit platters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ham is fabulous and the easiest thing in the world,'' Garten
says. She uses a spiral-cut smoked ham and tops it with a glaze
that takes just minutes to make in a food processor with mango
chutney, Dijon mustard, brown sugar, orange peel and orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   Her corn salad is best made with fresh corn, she noted, as
frozen doesn't have the texture or flavor desired for a fresh
salad. Her coleslaw is the store's classic, with more flavor than
traditional recipes, she said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not necessary to cook all the food for a party. You can
arrange gorgeous no-cook party platters with store-bought food that
is stylish and delicious. Or you can simply assemble party food by
arranging ingredients for an appetizer that might include farmhouse
cheddar cheese, apple slices and chutney. Garten includes plenty of
ideas in the back of the book. ``The secret is that platters are
very easy to make!''
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable platters are a cinch for home cooks. Garten, who does
lots of vegetable platters for parties, favors combining grilled,
roasted and boiled vegetables _ and allows about a half-pound per
person.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can cook all the vegetables yourself, or add some prepared
vegetables that you buy from a specialty food store.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to remember that the better the ingredients,
the less you need to do to make the dish taste good. Be inventive _
but mix the colors and textures to make a beautiful arrangement. I
choose vegetables that have hot colors that seem to clash: carrots,
beets, cherry tomatoes, purple onions and yellow peppers.''
</P>
<P>
   For fruit platters, be sure to choose ripe, seasonal fruit.
``Visually, your eye needs to have a focal point and to be able to
see each type of fruit. I like to have one thing that is taller
than the rest, such as a large bunch of grapes or a decoratively
cut papaya, to give the platter height.'' Then she adds berries and
other fruits in casual but organized groups.
</P>
<P>
   Her design concept for her colorful platters is
Japanese-inspired, she said. ``Tall represents the sky, something
solid in the middle represents the earth, and foods that flow
forward represent the water. Once you have those three elements in
any platter, it gives grounding to the design and it looks
better.'' On a fruit platter, for instance, she might arrange a big
bunch of grapes that stand tall, melons in the middle and berries
flowing forward. ``The simpler it is, the better it looks. Avoid
lots of colors with no design element or focal point.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Garten has refined her style, recipes and
entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``My entertaining at home has changed dramatically in the last
20 years. I've learned the simpler the food, the more fun the
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food is not about impressing people,'' she said. ``In fact,
it's just the opposite; it's about making them feel comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Fourth of July, for instance, she opted to grill
hamburgers, and for dessert she set out all the fixings for ice
cream sodas so everyone could make their own. ``Guests loved it _
and loosened up. And I didn't have to cook.''
</P>
<P>
   For successful parties, do as much as possible the day before
the party. And get everything done before the guests arrive,
emphasized Garten. Have all the drinks out on a table so guests can
help themselves and each other. A party is about connecting with
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most useful thing I learned by cooking professionally is
that there are a million things that you can do in advance to make
cooking less stressful.''
</P>
<P>
   Use an eclectic mix of platters and baskets for serving. And
when serving buffet style, be sure to position food items at
different levels (use pedestals) for the most attractive
presentation. Platters in the back should be higher than those in
front.
</P>
<P>
   Garten's philosophy of food revolves around taking really good
ingredients and enhancing them _ not masking them _ in cooking. ``I
take a local chicken, for example, and my goal is to bring out the
most wonderful flavor possible.'' It's really about simple food and
using the best fresh local ingredients (i.e. cheeses, sausages,
fruits, etc.) available. ``Recipes that are successful in the store
are often the simplest.''
</P>
<P>
   Garten doesn't feel threatened by giving out her recipes. `It
feels like a generous thing to do for my customers.'' Garten
believes a cookbook is just a starting place for cooks and that
people should give recipes their own style.
</P>
<P>
   Garten's ideas for her creations come from various sources and,
over the years, recipes evolve and change with the times. Sometimes
she creates a dish to be reminiscent of something old-fashioned and
familiar. For instance, the grilled salmon salad she came up with
looks and tastes better and fresher than tuna salad. She grills the
salmon and tosses it with raspberry vinegar and olive oil for
wonderful flavor. Her Pan-Fried Onion Dip brings back memories of
that Lipton favorite, California Dip, but Garten's rendition
contains caramelized onions and is more flavorful.
</P>
<P>
   For a summer party dessert, Garten recommends an easily prepared
Raspberry Tart with a shortbread crust. And if you don't have time
for that, assemble a platter of fresh raspberries with store-bought
creme fraiche and shortbread cookies purchased at a bakery.
</P>
<P>
   Also included are a couple of other dessert options for summer
parties including Tuscan Rosemary and Pine Nut Bars and Raspberry
Lemon Layer Cake, both of which go together in a jiffy. They're
from the new ``Short &AMP; Sweet, Sophisticated Desserts in No Time at
All'' by Melanie Barnard (Houghton Mifflin; $25). It features
numerous shortcuts that result in delicious desserts in under 30
minutes with seven ingredients or less. Many of the simple
creations would make great party fare.

SUN-DRIED TOMATO DIP
</P>
<P>
   Here is the most popular dip at Barefoot Contessa. Reminiscent
of Russian dressing, it is updated with the intense flavors of
sun-dried tomatoes and fresh green onions.  &QL; 
1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes in oil, drained and chopped (8
tomatoes) &QL; 
1 package (8 ounces) cream cheese, room temperature &QL; 
1/2 cup dairy sour cream &QL; 
1/2 cup mayonnaise &QL; 
10 dashes Tabasco sauce &QL; 
1 teaspoon kosher salt &QL; 
3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper &QL; 
2 green onions, thinly sliced (white and green parts)
</P>
<P>
   Puree tomatoes, cream cheese, sour cream, mayonnaise, Tabasco
sauce, salt and pepper in a food processor fitted with a metal
blade. Add green onions and pulse twice. Serve at room temperature
with crackers, chips and fresh vegetables. Makes 2 cups.

BAKED HAM
</P>
<P>
   This is the ultimate party dish. The glaze takes only a minute
to make, and the ham tastes like you worked for hours. Order a
spiral-cut smoked ham from the butcher, so you don't have to slice
it. Serve it for cocktails with mini corn muffins, or for an entree
with extra mustard and chutney. &QL; 
1 (14- to 16-pound) fully cooked, spiral-cut smoked ham &QL; 
6 garlic cloves &QL; 
8 1/2 ounces mango chutney (Major Grey's) &QL; 
1/2 cup Dijon mustard &QL; 
1 cup packed light brown sugar &QL; 
Peel of 1 orange &QL; 
1/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
</P>
<P>
   Place ham in a heavy roasting pan.
</P>
<P>
   Mince garlic in a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Add
chutney, mustard, brown sugar, orange peel and orange juice and
process until smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Pour glaze over ham. Bake in preheated 350-degree oven 1 hour,
until ham is fully heated and glaze is well browned.
</P>
<P>
   Serve hot or at room temperature. Makes 35 entree servings; 50
appetizer servings.

FRESH CORN SALAD
</P>
<P>
   For a particularly beautiful salad, you can mix white and yellow
corn. Don't substitute frozen corn; it doesn't have the texture or
flavor you want in a fresh salad. &QL; 
Water &QL; 
5 ears corn, shucked &QL; 
1/2 cup small-diced red onion (1 small onion) &QL; 
3 tablespoons cider vinegar &QL; 
3 tablespoons olive oil &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper &QL; 
1/2 cup chiffonade fresh basil leaves
</P>
<P>
   In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook corn 3 minutes,
until starchiness is just gone. Drain and immerse in ice water to
stop cooking and set color. When corn is cool, cut kernels off cob,
cutting close to cob.
</P>
<P>
   Toss kernels into a large bowl with red onion, vinegar, olive
oil, salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Just before serving, toss in fresh basil. Taste for seasonings
and serve cold or at room temperature. Makes 4 to 6 servings.

 &QL; 
VEGETABLE COLESLAW
</P>
<P>
   This is like traditional coleslaw but has a lot more flavor. The
vegetables can be sliced by hand, but it's faster to use a food
process. Placing the vegetables horizontally in the food processor
ensures long shreds. &QL; 
1 pound white cabbage (1/2 small head) &QL; 
3/4 pound red cabbage (1/2 small head) &QL; 
5 carrots &QL; 
2 cups mayonnaise &QL; 
1/4 cup Dijon mustard &QL; 
1 tablespoon sugar &QL; 
2 tablespoons cider vinegar &QL; 
2 teaspoons celery seeds &QL; 
1 teaspoon celery salt &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Fit a food processor with thickest slicing blade. Cut cabbages
into small wedges and place horizontally into feed tube. Process in
batches.
</P>
<P>
   Next, fit food processor with grating blade. Cut carrots in half
and place in feed tube so they are lying on their sides. Process in
batches and mix in a bowl with shredded cabbages.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, mustard, sugar,
vinegar, celery seeds, celery salt, kosher salt and pepper. Pour
enough of dressing over vegetables to moisten.
</P>
<P>
   Serve cold or at room temperature. Makes 8 to 10 servings.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Vegetables can be prepared a day ahead and stored,
unwrapped in plastic food container in refrigerator. Keep red
cabbage separate, or it will turn other vegetables pink.

 &QL; 
VEGETABLE PLATTER
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable platters are very easy to do at home: You can cook all
the vegetables yourself, or add some prepared vegetables from a
specialty food store. Combine the flavors of grilled vegetables,
roasted vegetables and even boiled potatoes and beets. Be
inventive, but mix the colors and textures to make a beautiful
arrangement. Allow a half-pound of vegetables per person.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange the vegetables in groups on a large platter. Sprinkle
with salt and pepper. Serve either hot or at room temperature. &QL; 
GRILLED VEGETABLES &QL; 
Bell peppers, seeded and cut into quarters &QL; 
Zucchini, sliced diagonally 1/2-inch thick &QL; 
Eggplant, unpeeled and sliced crosswise 1/2-inch thick &QL; 
Red onions, sliced 1/2-inch thick &QL; 
Asparagus, tough ends removed &QL; 
Beets, unpeeled and sliced 1/2-inch thick &QL; 
Olive oil &QL; 
Kosher salt &QL; 
Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Toss each vegetable with olive oil, kosher salt and freshly
ground black pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Grill over hot coals or on a cast-iron stove-top grill until
soft and charred, about 15 to 20 minutes. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
ROASTED VEGETABLES &QL; 
Carrots, sliced in 1/2-inch-thick diagonal slices &QL; 
Brussels sprouts, ends cut off and any yellow outer leaves removed &QL; 
Fennel bulbs, stems removed and bulb cut into 1/2-inch thick

FRESH FRUIT PLATTER
</P>
<P>
   The most important thing about making one of these platters is
choosing ripe, seasonal fruit. After that, it's just cutting and
arranging. For 10 to 12 people, here's a suggested list of
ingredients. &QL; 
2 small ripe melons &QL; 
1 golden pineapple &QL; 
2 bunches grapes &QL; 
1 pint fresh figs &QL; 
1 pint raspberries &QL; 
1 pint strawberries &QL; 
1 pint blueberries &QL; 
1 red papaya
</P>
<P>
   Begin platter with a base of ripe, colorful, sliced melons and
pineapple _ for example, cantaloupe, honeydew OR Galia melons, plus
pineapples. Peel outside of a whole melon, cut in half through stem
end and scoop out seeds. Place melon halves, cut side down, on a
board and slice straight across into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Fan
each half-melon out slightly and arrange on platter.
</P>
<P>
   Next, cut off top and bottom of pineapple, peel outside and use
a sharp knife to remove ``eyes.'' Cut pineapple in half lengthwise
and remove core by cutting a ``V'' down center of each half. Again,
place pineapple halves, cut side down, on a board and slice
straight across into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Fan slices out and
arrange next to melon on platter.
</P>
<P>
   Once base is set, you can add any kind of fruit that is
available. I like to have one thing that is taller than the rest,
such as a large bunch of grapes or a decoratively cut papaya, to
give platter height. Then I add raspberries, strawberries,
blueberries and fresh figs in casual but organized groups.
Visually, your eye needs to have a focal point and be able to see
each type of fruit. After all fruit is arranged, add flat green
leaves around outside of fruit to set off colors. Use lemon and
galax leaves from a florist or fig leaves and grape leaves from
your garden. Make sure they are pesticide-free and well rinsed.
</P>
<P>
   Any kind of fruit will work well on this platter. For special
occasions, add persimmons, kiwi, passion fruit, Queen Anne
cherries, fresh apricots and mangoes. Choose whatever is colorful
and seasonal.

RASPBERRY TART
</P>
<P>
   For this shortbread crust, just press the dough into the pan
rather than rolling it out. &QL; 
TART SHELL: &QL; 
3/4 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature &QL; 
1/2 cup sugar &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon vanilla &QL; 
1 3/4 cups all-purpose four &QL; 
Pinch salt &QL; 
FILLING: &QL; 
1 cup raspberry preserves &QL; 
1 1/2 pints fresh raspberries (3 packages)
</P>
<P>
   For Tart Shell, in bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a
paddle attachment, mix butter and sugar together until just
combined. Add vanilla.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium bowl, sift together flour and salt, then add to
butter-and-sugar mixture. Mix on low speed until dough starts to
come together.
</P>
<P>
   Dump onto a surface dusted with flour and shape into a flat
disk. Press dough into a 10-inch-round or 9-inch-square
removable-bottom tart pan, making sure that finished edge is flat.
Chill until firm.
</P>
<P>
   Butter one side of a square of foil to fit inside tart and place
it, buttered side down, on pastry. Fill with dry, uncooked beans or
rice.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven 20 minutes. Remove foil and
beans, prick tart all over with tines of a fork and bake again 20
to 25 minutes more, or until lightly browned. Allow to cool to room
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   For Filling, spread tart with raspberries preserves and place
fresh raspberries, stem end down, in concentric circles. If making
a square tart, place raspberries in rows. Serve immediately. Makes
10 to 12 servings.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Tart shell can be baked a day ahead, and tart can be
assembled a few hours before serving. Never refrigerate a baked
shell or a finished tart.

TUSCAN ROSEMARY &QL; 
AND PINE NUT BARS
</P>
<P>
   Don't scoff at putting pungent rosemary into cookies. These bars
are simply terrific. Pair them with a plate of grapes or pears and
wedges of dessert cheeses. &QL; 
1/4 cup pine nuts &QL; 
8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into 10 pieces &QL; 
1/2 cup powdered sugar &QL; 
1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary OR 2 teaspoons dried &QL; 
1 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   Spread pine nuts on a baking sheet and place in preheated
350-degree oven. Toast, stirring once or twice to prevent burning,
until they are a shade darker and fragrant, about 4 to 5 minutes.
Watch carefully; pine nuts burn easily. Remove from baking sheet
and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt butter.
Remove pan from heat and stir in powdered sugar, rosemary and pine
nuts. Then stir in flour to make a stiff dough.
</P>
<P>
   Spread and pat dough evenly into an ungreased 8-inch square
baking pan. Bake until bars are golden and firm at edges, about 20
minutes. Cool pan on a rack, about 2 minutes, then use a sharp
knife to cut into 16 squares.
</P>
<P>
   Let bars cool in pan at least 10 minutes before removing with a
small spatula. Bars can be stored, tightly covered, up to 5 days or
frozen for 1 month. Makes 16 cookies.

RASPBERRY LEMON LAYER CAKE
</P>
<P>
   Most special events are commemorated with a layer cake. With
high-quality prepared ingredients, such as store-bought pound cake
and lemon curd, creating a delicious and beautiful layer cake takes
just minutes and no skill at all. &QL; 
1 1/2 cups whipping OR heavy cream, chilled &QL; 
3 tablespoons powdered sugar &QL; 
3 tablespoons orange liqueur, such as Grand Marnier OR Cointreau OR
orange syrup &QL; 
1 store-bought pound cake (10- to 12-ounce package) &QL; 
1 cup store-bought lemon curd OR 1/2 cup lemon OR orange marmalade &QL; 
3 baskets (1/2 pint EACH) fresh raspberries, preferably 1 EACH of
red, black and golden berries
</P>
<P>
   Whip cream, powdered sugar and liqueur to firm peaks; set aside.
Use a serrated knife to cut cake horizontally into 3 even layers.
</P>
<P>
   Place a bottom layer of cake on a platter. Spread 1/3 of lemon
curd over cake. Top with a single layer of raspberries, placed in
rows, using alternating berry colors if you have them. Spread 1/3
of whipped cream over berries, taking care not to disturb rows.
Make another layer of cake, lemon curd, berries and cream in same
way. Top with remaining cake layer. Spread remaining lemon curd
over top of cake. Frost top and sides with remaining whipped cream.
Decorate top with remaining berries.
</P>
<P>
   Serve immediately, or refrigerate up to 4 hours. To serve, use a
serrated knife to cut thick slices. Makes 6 servings.

TOFFEE BARS
</P>
<P>
   The enduring candy-bar flavor combination of crisp, buttery
toffee and milk chocolate is equally appealing in a shortbread
cookie. Now that toffee chips are readily available, this recipe
has become my favorite for quick bar cookies. &QL; 
8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into 10 pieces &QL; 
1/2 cup packed light brown sugar &QL; 
1 teaspoon vanilla &QL; 
1 cup all-purpose flour &QL; 
1/2 cup plus 3 tablespoons toffee chips, such as Heath OR Skor &QL; 
1/2 cup milk chocolate chips
</P>
<P>
   In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stir butter until it
is melted, light brown and has a nutty aroma, about 3 minutes.
Watch carefully to prevent burning. Remove pan from heat and stir
in brown sugar and vanilla. Stir in flour to make a stiff dough,
then stir in 1/2 cup toffee chips.
</P>
<P>
   Spread and pat dough into an ungreased 8-inch square baking pan.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven about 20 minutes or until
golden brown. Place pan on a rack. Immediately sprinkle with
chocolate chips. Wait 1 minute to allow chocolate to melt, then
spread over bars to form an icing. (If chocolate does not melt,
return pan to oven for a few seconds, then spread.) Sprinkle with
remaining 3 tablespoons toffee chips.
</P>
<P>
   Let bars cool in pan 2 minutes, then use a sharp knife to cut
into 16 squares. Let cool 5 to 10 minutes more, then refrigerate at
least 5 to 10 minutes to set chocolate before using a small spatula
to remove bars from pan.
</P>
<P>
   Bars can be stored, tightly covered, up to 5 days, or frozen up
to 2 months. Makes 16 cookies.

 MARYVILLE, Tenn.: the hare.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alexander's third-place showing in Iowa in 1996 brought him
considerable money and attention, at least until he was shot down
in the New Hampshire primary by Bob Dole, and Alexander dropped out
a few weeks later. Now, he is staking seven years of work on the
hope that something like his third-place showing will happen again,
that his unassuming personality will play well in Iowa and attract
a quick pivot of the national attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who grew up in Maryville, plays the piano, was an
Eagle Scout and goes to church, is going to do well in Iowa, and
not badly in New Hampshire,'' Alexander said. ``Iowa and New
Hampshire suit me fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The real question, of course, is how he will fare in those parts
of the nation that do not share the open countryside, the
comfortable porch swings, the uncynical outlook of his hometown or
the rural precincts of Iowa. Though he is not as conservative as
Ronald Reagan, he frequently invokes Reagan's optimism and thematic
use of the presidency as his models, soothing his listeners with
slightly dreamy descriptions of how the country could return to
small-town values. But without Reagan's magnetism, his words may
play differently in large cities and their suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up, parents and teachers were deeply
involved in the lives of children,'' Alexander said in a speech a
few weeks ago at an outdoor festival in Elizabethton, Tenn.,
population 13,289, explaining why so many of today's children seem
to be lost. ``There were nosy neighbors who watched us as we went
to school, teachers who knew they had authority from the community
to teach us right from wrong as well as math and English. There
were choirmasters and scoutmasters and churches open so many days a
week that it seemed like Sunday came every other day. That is not
nostalgia, it is a tried and true recipe for helping our
children.''
</P>
<P>
   He is not a wooden speaker; his delivery is crisp and effective,
particularly with like-minded crowds, but he rarely sets his
listeners vibrating with an emotional connection. As frustrated as
he is with Bush's outsized silhouette, the worst thing he can say
about him is that the Texas governor is untested.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican Party official who has worked with Alexander said
he could probably outspeak Gore or Bill Bradley, the former New
Jersey senator who is challenging the vice president for the
Democratic nomination, but would have trouble against a more
charismatic candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a dear and wonderful man, but he can be in a room two
hours before you know he's there,'' the official said. ``It's hard
to define, but he needs more of that star quality people have come
to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, who is 58, seems aware that he is no firebrand, but
he argues that people have grown weary of charisma. This is not an
unfamiliar argument; it has been made many times over the years by
similar candidates, and is also being used this year by the Gore
and Bradley campaigns. But it is central to Alexander's conception
of himself, and this year he has decided to forgo the gimmickry of
the plaid shirts, which were originally designed to help him stand
out, and concentrate on the things he does well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't intend to try to manufacture an issue just to capture
the headlines,'' he said, referring to the recent publicity
surrounding Elizabeth Dole's embrace of gun control. ``That
wouldn't work; people would see through it. The best course for me
is to remember the fable of the tortoise and the hare, and organize
the counties and raise enough money, and practice my speeches and
have a good time. And hopefully the day after the Iowa caucuses,
everyone in the country will know who I am. So I'm going to have to
be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who listen will hear a firmly etched manifesto of moderate
grass-roots conservatism, presented in an easygoing Presbyterian
style, all common sense and good will. He is convinced that with
less interference from Washington, the parents, school boards and
local elected officials around the country can find their own
solutions to educational problems.
</P>
<P>
   He no longer advocates the dismantling of the Department of
Education, aware that such a proposal sounds a bit strange coming
from a man who was President George Bush's education secretary. But
he still wants to help families by giving children $1,500
scholarships and letting them choose their own school, public,
private or charter. He favors breaking the power of teachers'
unions and federal bureaucrats, believing that schools can in
essence fix themselves if parents and principals are given more
independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore thinks he knows what's best for this country,''
Alexander says in every stump speech. ``What I want to do is bring
out the best in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes him about 20 seconds to go from denouncing the
Littleton shootings to demanding an end to the marriage tax and a
tripling of the child deductions, certain that a restructuring of
federal tax policy will strengthen families as much as the economy.
He does not favor an amendment outlawing abortion and says he could
support some federal gun-control legislation, but also supports a
missile defense system and wants no limits on campaign fund-raising

   Though he was a clerk for the late Federal Judge John Minor
Wisdom, one of the authors of modern affirmative action, he opposes

   Alexander is annoyed by the suggestion that he is unusually
persevering, suspecting the implication is that his cause is
hopeless, and he correctly points out that Reagan and many other
politicians tried more than once for the presidency. He is clearly
propelled by a sense that he has trained for the presidency, and
seems mystified that the country might not want to make use of the
skills he developed in the Tennessee state house, at the helm of
the University of Tennessee, and in the leadership of a successful
day- care business that made him a wealthy man after drawing on his
contacts as governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``By this age, I pretty much know what my skills are, and I felt
like when I was governor, I was really at the peak of my
performance in making the most contributions I could make,'' he
said. ``I just feel that this is what I should be doing. My
character and demeanor, which wouldn't be suited to every set of
times, might be, as it turns out, very well-suited to these
times.''

ALLIES, RUSSIA AGREE ON KOSOVO PEACE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ NATO and Yugoslav Army generals Tuesday night resumed
their discussions to organize the withdrawal of Serb forces from
Kosovo, after the world's seven industrialized nations and Russia
agreed on the wording of a United Nations resolution that calls for
an end to the war.
</P>
<P>
   The UN Security Council could vote on the resolution Wednesday,
but in a concession to the Serb side NATO will suspend its air
strikes before that vote is taken. Once NATO verifies that Serb
forces are withdrawing from Kosovo, the air campaign will be
formally called off.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, NATO had said the Serbs would have seven days to
leave Kosovo, but US Defense Secretary William S. Cohen has said
that could be extended a few days if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The sequence of events was crucial to winning agreement between
the Western allies, who are NATO members, and Russia, which is an
ally of Yugoslavia and has been trying to broker a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO officials got a key point they wanted. The resolution
calls on parties to the agreement to cooperate with the war crimes
tribunal at The Hague, which indicted Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and four other top Serb officials two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Air-raid sirens sounded Tuesday night in Belgrade, but there
were no explosions.
</P>
<P>
   However, NATO sources said a B-52 bomber caught two Yugoslav
army battalions of possibly more than 1,000 men in the open Tuesday
near the Kosovo-Albania border after Serbia stalled on withdrawals,
and that many hundreds of troops might have been killed. Serb
sources denied that major casualties resulted.
</P>
<P>
   US intelligence has detected signs that Serb forces are making
preparations to withdraw from Kosovo, although no troops are moving
or assembling for a pullout, the Pentagon said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to reporters at the Pentagon, spokesman Kenneth Bacon
said the signs include the mobilization of Serb transport vehicles
in Kosovo that would be used to move soldiers out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just beginning to see signs of preparations for
withdrawal. We have not yet seen any withdrawal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from the Western allies, meanwhile, the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army said it would not attack withdrawing Serb
forces. Yugoslav generals had expressed concerns about leaving
their troops open to ambush by rebel forces as they left Kosovo.
The American government, in particular, has been pressuring Kosovo
Liberation Army leader Hashim Thaci not to exploit the pullout for
tactical gain.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatic efforts to end the war got back on track Tuesday
after several days of delay, which had more to do with domestic
Serbian politics than anything else. Milosevic is trying to
convince the public here that by holding out for more than 70 days
of NATO bombing, he has forced NATO to relinquish to the UN the
responsibility of administering postwar Kosovo, safeguarding
Yugoslav sovereignty over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Yugoslav generals balked at signing the
agreement that stipulates the routes and timetables of their
pullout. Serb officials delayed its initiation so they could
characterize it as the UN assuming control rather than NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, who helped persuade
Milosevic to accept the Group of Eight withdrawal principles last
week, flew to Beijing to ask the Chinese government not to use its
veto on the Security Council to block the resolution. The Chinese
are still angry over the bombing of its Embassy here last month,
which NATO says was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   China, which did not help draft the resolution with foreign
ministers from the Group of Eight countries, took issue with two
points in the text that will create the peace force.
</P>
<P>
   China's deputy permanent UN representative, Shen Guofang, said
Beijing objected to a passage that will allow the peacekeepers to
use force. Beijing was also upset by mention of the war crimes
tribunal in the Hague, which has indicted Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic. Sheng said the indictment was ``politically
motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   But the main sticking point to adoption remains Beijing's and
Moscow's insistence that NATO stop bombing. Both Russia and China
hold veto power on the council.
</P>
<P>
   ``By adopting the resolution we cannot give justification to
NATO for the further bombing of Yugoslavia,'' Sheng said. ``Only
after the Security Council receives confirmation that NATO stops
bombing can we take action. The Security Council is not a rubber
stamp.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Western allies and Russia were able to bridge their
differences, mainly by moving any reference to NATO to the
resolution's annex, there was still a divide over who would control
the estimated 50,000 troops that will form the international
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, where the Group of Eight representatives drafted the
UN resolution, US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Russian
foreign minister Igor Ivanov contradicted each other as they
discussed what they had signed. She said the resolution stipulates
that ``NATO will be the military leader'' of the peacekeeping
force. But Ivanov said Russian troops, which may make up 10,000 of
the force, would not be under NATO command, and insisted all
matters for the peacekeeping force are ``a subject of
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer tried to smooth over the
differences, saying, ``precise details of the peacekeeping group
need to be worked out. This will certainly have a NATO element to
it, but all these questions have to be answered.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Russians said they had prevailed in getting the West
to make concessions, British Foreign Minister Robin Cook insisted
that the agreement that Milosevic had accepted last week had not
been renegotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the Yugoslav capital, deputy Foreign Minister Nebojsa
Vujovic said his government would adhere to the resolution, but he
insisted that the agreement that calls for a withdrawal of Serb
soldiers and police in Kosovo does not cover customs officials. He
said the Yugoslav government wants to leave those customs officials
at border crossings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should see who is crossing the border,'' said Vujovic. He
said only refugees who left Kosovo would be allowed back in, and
that Yugoslav officials were needed to deter Albanian citizens or
``terrorists who will start chasing Serbs'' from entering the
country.
</P>
<P>
   But speaking in Germany, where the Group of Eight foreign
ministers gathered to hash out the UN resolution, Albright
dismissed that idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be a few (Serb officials) at the border, but as
observers,'' she said. ``They will not be able to control access to
or from Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians who fled Kosovo said that Serb officials took
their identification papers as they left, saying they would never
come back. But Albright said the UN High Commissioner for Refugees
has provided refugees with new identification papers.
</P>
<P>
   Vujovic, who returned to Macedonia to attend the discussions
with NATO officials, would not even refer to NATO by its name. He
called it ``the delegation under UN auspices.''
</P>
<P>
   Such semantics explain the sensitivities and much of the
stalling by Yugoslav officials since they began discussions with
Lieutenant General Mike Jackson, the commander of 16,000 NATO
forces in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea welcomed the agreement
reached in Germany, saying, ``We now have a clear road map to bring
this conflict to an end.''

DRUG MAKERS SKEPTICAL OVER DRUG PLAN FOR ELDERLY
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Wash., Ore., N.Y., Calif., Texas, Fla.)  (jw) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Drug industry and insurance executives reacted with skepticism
on Tuesday to reports that the White House was planning a new
prescription-drug benefit for all elderly Americans. Under the
proposal, Medicare recipients would pay $10 to $25 a month in
addition to the current Medicare premium of $45.50, which does not
cover drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Drug manufacturers said they did not believe administration
officials' assurances that the proposal would not lead to price
controls on drugs. Alan Holmer, president of Pharma, a trade
association, said the manufacturers favored government support for
drugs for the elderly but opposed a program that would be run by
Medicare officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we don't need is more restrictions, more bureaucracy and
government red tape, which we believe would inevitably flow from a
giant new program run by HCFA,'' he said, referring to the Federal
Health Care Financing Administration, which administers Medicare.
``In our view the proposals will inevitably lead to price
controls,'' Holmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Lamberton, a drug industry analyst at HSBC Securities, said
the Clinton administration was likely to demand price rebates from
the drug companies, like those already in force for state Medicaid
for low-income people. Controls or rebates could reduce profits.
</P>
<P>
   Managed-care executives said government spending curbs were
threatening existing drug coverage under Medicare managed-care
plans. ``You cannot give with one hand and take away with other,''
said Phil Nudelman, chairman of Kaiser Group Health, which provides
Medicare managed-care coverage for 100,000 people in Washington and
Oregon. Kaiser Group Health is a joint venture of the Kaiser
Permanente unit in the Northwest and the Group Health Cooperative
of Puget Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health
Plans, a managed care trade group, said Medicare health plans in
many big cities _ including New York, Los Angeles, Houston, Dallas
and Miami _ were considering cuts in drug benefits because of the
cost squeeze in the 1997 Balanced Budget Act.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers outside the government said it would be difficult
for a drug benefit to generate overall savings. ``Drugs save money
in treatment for certain conditions,'' said Michael Gluck, director
of health policy studies at the National Academy of Social
Insurance. But he expressed ``healthy skepticism'' about ``systemic
savings.''
</P>
<P>
   The academy, a nonpartisan research center supported by
foundations, has predicted that adding a general drug benefit will
increase Medicare costs by 7 percent to 13 percent over the next
decade, or $17.5 billion to $24 billion the first year. The higher
cost would come if the government picked up 100 percent of the
costs, above a certain threshold, for expensive illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are always concerned about who is going to pay for this in
the budget, whether the savings that the administration projects
are indeed achievable,'' said Joyce Oberdorf, a spokeswoman for
Aetna Inc., the big health insurer.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Kalen, executive director of the Managed Health Care
Association, an employers group, said her members would welcome a
pharmacy benefit that would help retirees and save money for the
companies. But she added that savings from covering drugs had yet
to be proven. ``We are seeing health premiums generally rising and
seeing drug costs rising'' even faster, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The outlines of the president's proposal, which he mentioned in
the State of the Union message last winter, were reported Tuesday,
but industry spokesmen cautioned that they had not yet seen a
detailed version.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the 39 million Americans eligible for Medicare
already have drug benefits, but the coverage is often incomplete.
Most are covered by former employers, but many companies are
cutting back as prescription drug costs rise.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 5 million have drug plans in Medicare health maintenance
organizations, which vary widely across the country. Drug coverage
is low in the Northwest, for example, because Medicare payments are
lower than in other regions, Nudelman of Kaiser Group Health said.
</P>
<P>
   John Rother, policy director of the American Association of
Retired Persons, said the proposals under discussion in the
administration would probably be ``much more expensive'' than
Medicare HMO coverage in many cities. To keep down overall costs in
the federal budget, the elderly would have to pay a stiff share of
the cost of a prescription.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the proposals would not make much difference to
the standard supplementary policies offered through AARP and by a
number of commercial insurance companies. Only three of the 10
types of supplementary policies cover drugs, and only 10 percent to
15 percent of the customers buy this expensive coverage, he said.

   WASHINGTON _ When the Serbian parliament voted on an
international peace proposal last Thursday, it omitted one footnote
on NATO's participation in the security force that would enter
Kosovo, while approving the rest of the proposal. The footnote is
also missing from the Security Council resolution drafted Tuesday
in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Following is the footnote from last week's proposal:
</P>
<P>
   It is understood that NATO considers an international security
force with ``substantial NATO participation'' to mean unified
command and control and having NATO at the core. This in turn means
a unified NATO chain of command under the political direction of
the N.A.C. in consultation with non-NATO force contributors. All
NATO countries, partners and other countries will be eligible to
contribute to the international security force. NATO units would be
under NATO command. It is understood that Russia's position is that
the Russian contingent will not be under NATO command and its
relationship to the international presence will be governed by
relevant additional agreements.

   LOS ANGELES _ Salads can make substantial and satisfying main
dishes. And with time at a premium for most weeknight cooks,
they're a great, fast solution to the what-to-serve-for-dinner
dilemma. You can whip up a terrific, healthful, alluring and
innovative combination _ full of texture and a tempting variety of
colors and flavors in no time flat _ and often without any cooking
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Main-dish salads can be as substantial and filling as any entree
_ particularly if they contain a cornucopia of protein, assorted
vegetables and greens, fruits or even starches such as potatoes or
pasta. Even better, there are no restrictions or hard and fast
rules. Cooks are limited only by their imagination and image of
what makes a glorious meal.
</P>
<P>
   Also, most entree salads don't require elaborate preparation,
can be assembled at the last minute and be pulled together with
plenty of choices of prepared, store-bought salad-friendly
convenience items like cooked chicken or shrimp or roast beef,
numerous combinations of prewashed and cut-up bagged greens,
spinach or cabbage, cleaned and cut-up bagged veggies (carrots,
broccoli, etc.) or fruits, cut-up or shredded cheeses, cooked
canned beans or corn, jarred artichoke hearts, store-bought
guacamole, salsas, bottled dressings and more.
</P>
<P>
   Today's collection of recipes showcases the ease and diversity
of entree salads. You can choose from a classic Grilled Chicken
Caesar Salad or White Beans With Tuna, or try something more
offbeat like a Thai Cobb Salad, Salmon Salad With Tomato Salsa or
Chicken Salad With Fennel, Orange and Raspberries. Or toss together
a Taco Salad Con Pollo or Southwestern Chicken Black Bean Salad.
</P>
<P>
   If you keep your pantry and fridge stocked with items like
artichoke hearts, tuna, capers, fresh herbs, kalamata olives, feta
cheese, shredded cheese, cooked shrimp, marinated mushrooms,
hard-cooked eggs, assorted leafy greens and lettuce mixtures,
sun-dried tomatoes, roasted red peppers, green peppers, green
onions, peeled garlic and an array of vinegars, olive oils,
mustards and prepared dressings and greens, you can turn out an
interesting and colorful creation at the drop of a hat. Just pick
whatever strikes your fancy and toss together everything in a bowl
with any dressing you choose. Make your own vinaigrette with olive
oil, red or white wine or a little balsamic vinegar, Dijon mustard
and a sprinkling of favorite herbs.
</P>
<P>
   The next time you prepare an entree, consider cooking extra
meat, fish, seafood or poultry so you have leftovers on hand to
whip up an innovative salad within the next night or two.
</P>
<P>
   When selecting greens, the choices these days are mind-boggling.
Select from Boston, iceberg, bibb, romaine or red leaf lettuces,
curly endive, escarole, radicchio, arugula, watercress, spinach,
cabbage and more. Your local farmers' market may offer other
novelty options as well. Be sure the greens are fresh when
purchased _ and avoid those that are limp and bruised. Store
unrinsed greens in plastic bags in the refrigerator until needed.
Rinse in plenty of cold water when ready to use, then blot dry to
remove excess moisture. Plan to use all lettuces within a few days
of buying. Romaine and iceberg are the exceptions as they will
usually keep a week in the fridge.
</P>
<P>
   Use a variety of greens for complementary textures, flavors and
colors and perk up salads with fresh herbs. Experts advise tearing
rather than cutting greens into bite-size pieces. Dress salads just
before serving with only enough dressing to coat the leaves
lightly, not drown them.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a rundown of some spontaneous salad ideas to toss
together when the weather sizzles, or when you want to get dinner
on the table in a jiffy. You'll probably think of many more.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Arrange cut-up fresh fruits on assorted greens and top with
slices of grilled chicken. Pass a curried fruit dressing or sour
cream mixed with orange juice concentrate and a few poppy seeds.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Combine leftover rice with chopped onion, chopped red and
green peppers, green onions, diced cooked chicken or turkey, garlic
pepper, raisins and chopped dried apricots _ and toss with a
store-bought lemon vinaigrette or curry dressing. If you like, add
a sprinkling of chopped fresh or powdered ginger. Serve over
assorted baby greens.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Toss diced cooked chicken with cooked elbow macaroni and
peas, chopped green onions, pickle relish or chopped dill pickles,
low-fat plain yogurt, shredded Cheddar cheese and seasoned salt and
pepper to taste. Serve over bite-size greens.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Mix store-bought pesto with cut-up cooked turkey breast,
chopped tomatoes, chopped green onions, sliced water chestnuts and
a few tablespoons sour cream. Serve over shredded bibb lettuce and
pass extra pesto.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; For an easy rendition of a tostada salad, heat leftover
chili on an individual dinner plate in the microwave oven until
hot. Then top with a mound of shredded iceberg lettuce, shredded
cheese of your choice, chopped tomatoes and sour cream, salsa and
guacamole. Pass Italian or cilantro dressing, if desired.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; A pizza salad in a bowl goes together fast with torn romaine
lettuce, Boboli pizza shells torn or cut into bite-size pieces, a
few tablespoons chopped fresh basil, Italian or french dressing,
chopped salami or pepperoni and shredded mozzarella cheese.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; If you keep a jar of roasted red peppers on hand and pick up
already cooked chicken breast strips at the supermarket, you can
combine them with pimiento-stuffed green olive pieces, drained
capers, ketchup, red wine vinegar, several tablespoons chopped
fresh basil, a dash of sugar, salt and pepper for a wonderful salad
to serve on shredded lettuce.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Diced cooked chicken breast also combines well with a diced
hothouse cucumber, chopped red onion, chopped dill pickles, chopped
celery, whole-grain and Dijon mustards, red wine vinegar, garlic,
oil and salt and pepper for a fabulous salad ideal to serve over
assorted greens.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Another good offering _ this one with Asian overtones _
combines blanched Chinese pea pods, green onions, toasted pecan
halves, shredded cooked chicken breast, vegetable oil, sesame oil,
rice vinegar, soy sauce and Tabasco sauce.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Turn antipasto into a salad by tossing together chopped
tomatoes, green peppers and green onions with thin strips of Genoa
salami, rinsed and drained garbanzo beans, ripe olives, roasted red
pepper pieces, chopped fresh basil and bottled Italian vinaigrette.
Serve on a bed of torn fresh spinach leaves. &QL;

PROTESTING HORMEL APPOINTMENT, SENATOR BLOCKS OTHER NOMINATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla., W.Va., Calif.)   (bl)  
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ All of President Clinton's civilian nominations
before the Senate were blocked indefinitely on Tuesday by a
conservative Republican senator in protest of Clinton's decision to
name a gay philanthropist as an ambassador without Senate
confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., vowed to hold up the nominations _
including that of Lawrence Summers as Treasury secretary and
Richard Holbrooke as chief U.S. diplomat to the United Nations _
until the White House agreed to strict limitations on the use of
so-called recess appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe accused Clinton of a ``flagrant abuse of the recess
appointment power'' when, during last week's congressional recess,
he appointed James Hormel as ambassador to Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   The senator described Hormel, a San Francisco businessman and
heir to a meat-packing fortune, as a ``gay activist who puts his
agenda ahead of the agenda of America.'' He would be the first
openly gay U.S. ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of a recess appointment, Hormel can serve
without Senate approval until the end of the next session of
Congress, which is likely to be the fall of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe has long opposed the nomination of Hormel, whose initial
nomination as ambassador died on the Senate floor last year because
Republican leaders would not let it be brought to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Under a custom that stretches back generations, a single senator
can block any nomination pending before the Senate. The question is
how far Inhofe and his conservative allies in the Senate will try
to push this issue, and for how long. If nominations are blocked
indefinitely, Democrats in the Senate would almost certainly
retaliate by blocking legislative matters of importance to
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott joined Inhofe in criticizing
Hormel's recess appointment, describing it as ``a subversion of the
confirmation process.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lott indicated he was unlikely to go along with Inhofe's
blanket objection to all of the president's pending nominations,
because that could hold up a variety of other Senate business.
</P>
<P>
   He said it ``would not be my inclination'' to allow a single
senator to singlehandedly block all nominations. ``I wouldn't honor
a hold indefinitely,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lott conceded that Inhofe had the right to hold up
nominations on a case-by-case basis, so long as his opponents did
not come up with the 60 votes needed under Senate rules to stop
him.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Barry Toiv said, ``It's hard to imagine
that the Senate would allow itself to be prevented from carrying
out its constitutional responsibilities over one senator's
unhappiness with a particular appointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, Toiv said, ``has been very selective and judicious in
his use of the recess appointment,'' noting that Clinton had made
57 such appointments during his presidency, compared with 239 by
President Ronald Reagan and 78 by President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Inhofe said he was prepared to ``take
this as far as necessary,'' even if that meant a long delay before
Senate confirmation of Summers, who has been nominated to replace
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be a lot of trauma with that one,'' Inhofe said of
a possible delay in approval of a Treasury secretary. The value of
the dollar fell broadly Tuesday against other major currencies, a
situation that currency traders described as a reflection at least
in some small part of the concern that Summers might not be
confirmed quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe said he would continue to block the nominations until
Clinton agreed to refrain from making recess appointments or to
make them only if Congress was notified in advance that they were
``absolutely necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar deal was worked out in 1985 between the Reagan
administration and Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who was then Senate
majority leader. Byrd held up thousands of nominations, including
several appellate judgeships and two high-ranking United Nations
nominees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go as far as Bob Byrd did,'' Inhofe said.
``Obviously, President Reagan did something he shouldn't have done,
and he learned his lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe is known for a fiery brand of conservatism and for his
passionate determination, if not stubbornness.
</P>
<P>
   While a member of the House, he was instrumental in changing
House rules to loosen control of the House leadership over what
bills were allowed to come to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   The measure forced the House to make public the names of
lawmakers who had signed so-called discharge petitions to force
bills out of committee, allowing the public and lobbyists to
identify nonsigners and pressure them to bypass the committees and
their powerful chairmen.
</P>
<P>
   Senate customs that permit a single lawmaker to hold up the
workings of the government might seem undemocratic. But they have a
long, romantic history in the clubby confines of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the `Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' view of government,''
said Richard Baker, the Senate's historian.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules from the very beginning of the institution have
assumed, without spelling it out in great detail, that a senator
from even a small, thinly populated state has the right to protect
that state's interests against precipitous legislation or
presidential nominations that might be out of touch with the views
of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe's action on Tuesday has an immediate impact on seven
mid-level Clinton administration nominees who are awaiting
confirmation. They include nominees to be an assistant secretary of
energy, an assistant administrator of the Environmental Protection
Agency and ambassador to the Federal States of Micronesia.

(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) FRESH FRUIT PLATTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most important thing about making one of these platters is
choosing ripe, seasonal fruit. After that, it's just cutting and
arranging. For 10 to 12 people, here's a suggested list of
ingredients. &QL; 
2 small ripe melons &QL; 
1 golden pineapple &QL; 
2 bunches grapes &QL; 
1 pint fresh figs &QL; 
1 pint raspberries &QL; 
1 pint strawberries &QL; 
1 pint blueberries &QL; 
1 red papaya
</P>
<P>
   Begin platter with a base of ripe, colorful, sliced melons and
pineapple _ for example, cantaloupe, honeydew OR Galia melons, plus
pineapples. Peel outside of a whole melon, cut in half through stem
end and scoop out seeds. Place melon halves, cut side down, on a
board and slice straight across into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Fan
each half-melon out slightly and arrange on platter.
</P>
<P>
   Next, cut off top and bottom of pineapple, peel outside and use
a sharp knife to remove ``eyes.'' Cut pineapple in half lengthwise
and remove core by cutting a ``V'' down center of each half. Again,
place pineapple halves, cut side down, on a board and slice
straight across into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Fan slices out and
arrange next to melon on platter.
</P>
<P>
   Once base is set, you can add any kind of fruit that is
available. I like to have one thing that is taller than the rest,
such as a large bunch of grapes or a decoratively cut papaya, to
give platter height. Then I add raspberries, strawberries,
blueberries and fresh figs in casual but organized groups.
Visually, your eye needs to have a focal point and be able to see
each type of fruit. After all fruit is arranged, add flat green
leaves around outside of fruit to set off colors. Use lemon and
galax leaves from a florist or fig leaves and grape leaves from
your garden. Make sure they are pesticide-free and well rinsed.
</P>
<P>
   Any kind of fruit will work well on this platter. For special
occasions, add persimmons, kiwi, passion fruit, Queen Anne
cherries, fresh apricots and mangoes. Choose whatever is colorful
and seasonal.

</P>
<P>
   &LR; RASPBERRY TART
</P>
<P>
   For this shortbread crust, just press the dough into the pan
rather than rolling it out. &QL; 
TART SHELL: &QL; 
3/4 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature &QL; 
1/2 cup sugar &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon vanilla &QL; 
1 3/4 cups all-purpose four &QL; 
Pinch salt &QL; 
FILLING: &QL; 
1 cup raspberry preserves &QL; 
1 1/2 pints fresh raspberries (3 packages)
</P>
<P>
   For Tart Shell, in bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a
paddle attachment, mix butter and sugar together until just
combined. Add vanilla.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium bowl, sift together flour and salt, then add to
butter-and-sugar mixture. Mix on low speed until dough starts to
come together.
</P>
<P>
   Dump onto a surface dusted with flour and shape into a flat
disk. Press dough into a 10-inch-round or 9-inch-square
removable-bottom tart pan, making sure that finished edge is flat.
Chill until firm.
</P>
<P>
   Butter one side of a square of foil to fit inside tart and place
it, buttered side down, on pastry. Fill with dry, uncooked beans or
rice.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven 20 minutes. Remove foil and
beans, prick tart all over with tines of a fork and bake again 20
to 25 minutes more, or until lightly browned. Allow to cool to room
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   For Filling, spread tart with raspberries preserves and place
fresh raspberries, stem end down, in concentric circles. If making
a square tart, place raspberries in rows. Serve immediately. Makes
10 to 12 servings.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Tart shell can be baked a day ahead, and tart can be
assembled a few hours before serving. Never refrigerate a baked
shell or a finished tart.

   &LR; TUSCAN ROSEMARY &UR;  &LR; AND PINE NUT BARS
</P>
<P>
   Don't scoff at putting pungent rosemary into cookies. These bars
are simply terrific. Pair them with a plate of grapes or pears and
wedges of dessert cheeses. &QL; 
1/4 cup pine nuts &QL; 
8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into 10 pieces &QL; 
1/2 cup powdered sugar &QL; 
1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary OR 2 teaspoons dried &QL; 
1 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   Spread pine nuts on a baking sheet and place in preheated
350-degree oven. Toast, stirring once or twice to prevent burning,
until they are a shade darker and fragrant, about 4 to 5 minutes.
Watch carefully; pine nuts burn easily. Remove from baking sheet
and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt butter.
Remove pan from heat and stir in powdered sugar, rosemary and pine
nuts. Then stir in flour to make a stiff dough.
</P>
<P>
   Spread and pat dough evenly into an ungreased 8-inch square
baking pan. Bake until bars are golden and firm at edges, about 20
minutes. Cool pan on a rack, about 2 minutes, then use a sharp
knife to cut into 16 squares.
</P>
<P>
   Let bars cool in pan at least 10 minutes before removing with a
small spatula. Bars can be stored, tightly covered, up to 5 days or
frozen for 1 month. Makes 16 cookies.

   &LR; RASPBERRY LEMON LAYER CAKE
</P>
<P>
   Most special events are commemorated with a layer cake. With
high-quality prepared ingredients, such as store-bought pound cake
and lemon curd, creating a delicious and beautiful layer cake takes
just minutes and no skill at all. &QL; 
1 1/2 cups whipping OR heavy cream, chilled &QL; 
3 tablespoons powdered sugar &QL; 
3 tablespoons orange liqueur, such as Grand Marnier OR Cointreau OR
orange syrup &QL; 
1 store-bought pound cake (10- to 12-ounce package) &QL; 
1 cup store-bought lemon curd OR 1/2 cup lemon OR orange marmalade &QL; 
3 baskets (1/2 pint EACH) fresh raspberries, preferably 1 EACH of
red, black and golden berries
</P>
<P>
   Whip cream, powdered sugar and liqueur to firm peaks; set aside.
Use a serrated knife to cut cake horizontally into 3 even layers.
</P>
<P>
   Place a bottom layer of cake on a platter. Spread 1/3 of lemon
curd over cake. Top with a single layer of raspberries, placed in
rows, using alternating berry colors if you have them. Spread 1/3
of whipped cream over berries, taking care not to disturb rows.
Make another layer of cake, lemon curd, berries and cream in same
way. Top with remaining cake layer. Spread remaining lemon curd
over top of cake. Frost top and sides with remaining whipped cream.
Decorate top with remaining berries.
</P>
<P>
   Serve immediately, or refrigerate up to 4 hours. To serve, use a
serrated knife to cut thick slices. Makes 6 servings.

<P>
   &LR; TOFFEE BARS
</P>
<P>
   The enduring candy-bar flavor combination of crisp, buttery
toffee and milk chocolate is equally appealing in a shortbread
cookie. Now that toffee chips are readily available, this recipe
has become my favorite for quick bar cookies. &QL; 
8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into 10 pieces &QL; 
1/2 cup packed light brown sugar &QL; 
1 teaspoon vanilla &QL; 
1 cup all-purpose flour &QL; 
1/2 cup plus 3 tablespoons toffee chips, such as Heath OR Skor &QL; 
1/2 cup milk chocolate chips
</P>
<P>
   In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stir butter until it
is melted, light brown and has a nutty aroma, about 3 minutes.
Watch carefully to prevent burning. Remove pan from heat and stir
in brown sugar and vanilla. Stir in flour to make a stiff dough,
then stir in 1/2 cup toffee chips.
</P>
<P>
   Spread and pat dough into an ungreased 8-inch square baking pan.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven about 20 minutes or until
golden brown. Place pan on a rack. Immediately sprinkle with
chocolate chips. Wait 1 minute to allow chocolate to melt, then
spread over bars to form an icing. (If chocolate does not melt,
return pan to oven for a few seconds, then spread.) Sprinkle with
remaining 3 tablespoons toffee chips.
</P>
<P>
   Let bars cool in pan 2 minutes, then use a sharp knife to cut
into 16 squares. Let cool 5 to 10 minutes more, then refrigerate at
least 5 to 10 minutes to set chocolate before using a small spatula
to remove bars from pan.
</P>
<P>
   Bars can be stored, tightly covered, up to 5 days, or frozen up
to 2 months. Makes 16 cookies.

JACKSON WARNS OF PERILS IN KOSOVO PEACEKEEPING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Instrumental in a prisoner release in Yugoslavia and
trying for another, the Rev. Jesse Jackson predicted Tuesday that a
US-led peacekeeping mission in Kosovo may last for decades and
culminate in US soldiers battling ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Milosevic agrees ... to pull out, and we move in ground
troops, there is no cause for celebration,'' Jackson told reporters
and editors at the Globe. ``It is premature.''

University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, characterized
the NATO-led air campaign on Yugoslavia as well-intentioned but
riven with unintended consequences: ecological damage, stirrings
with Russia, costly dustups with China, and commitments to spend
billions of dollars that could have improved education and job
opportunities at home or elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Russia saw us as the big superpower'' before Kosovo,
Jackson said, ``11 weeks later, they have to be a little less
afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   China, too, could exact a high price from the United States for
its cooperation with a United Nations resolution that could halt
hostilities, he said. Jackson ticked off a checklist of potential
US paybacks to Beijing, such as less pressure by Washington on
issues including human rights violations, repression in Tibet,
creeping hegemony over Taiwan, espionage disclosures, and US
campaign finance abuses.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the interview, Jackson referred to his triumph
working with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to free three US
servicemen on May 2. He said he had spoken three times with
Yugoslavia's foreign minister and hopes to return to Belgrade soon
to arrange the release of three workers for the humanitarian group
CARE who were convicted of spying and sentenced to prison on May
29.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson dismissed any suggestion that the CARE workers, two
Australians and a Yugoslav, were spies. ``To arrest them,'' he
said, ``is to chill the work of humanitarian aid agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating a multibillion-dollar flow of aid to the Balkans,
Jackson envisoned an effort without end. ``We will be in Bosnia and
Kosovo as long as we are in Korea,'' said Jackson, reflecting on
nearly a half-century of US involvement on the Asian peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   ``The paradox,'' he said, ``is that we'll end up fighting the
(Kosovo Liberation Army) to protect the Serbs.'' Jackson
characterized the ethnic Albanian guerrilla force as funded by drug
money.
</P>
<P>
   This US time and attention, he said, comes at the expense of
Africa, with 800 million potential consumers and a rising source of
US oil imports. Jackson said US media outlets and Washington, which
closely tracked his prisoner release in Belgrade, generally ignored
his trip a week later when he helped negotiate an end to a far
bloodier conflict in West Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said 10,000 people died in January alone in Sierra
Leone's civil war, more casualties than throughout the Kosovo
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The US civil rights leader said he has not wearied of striving
for change. He reflected on the cascade of opportunities that have
revolutionized American race relations in the past four decades as
well as the job to be done.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later at the Kennedy School, he was pushing again,
combining commencement comments on Yugoslavia with a challenge to
the roughly 500 graduates and family to change the school itself.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 106 professors at the Kennedy School, only six are black,
Jackson said, citing figures that a school spokesman confirmed. Of
those, only one is tenured and two are on tenure tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Institutions like the Kennedy School of Government have the
ability to move with alacrity if they so desire,'' he said. ``I
challenge the administration of the school to double the number of
tenure-track minority faculty members in a year, two years if
absolutely necessary. ... If this institution desires to instill in
its students the ability to make just choices, let it lead by
example.''

TEAM REPORTS PROGRESS ON LUXURY-SEAT SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New England Patriots have sold 43 of the 80 luxury suites in
a proposed stadium in Foxborough, with about $80 million already
committed to the premium seats over the first decade the facility
is open.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than half of the seats are already sold, and that's the
fastest, that we are aware of, for any new stadium,'' said Paul
Tagliabue, commissioner of the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue and local business officials leading the push to help
the Patriots sell the luxury suites announced the status of the
sales Tuesday, after unveiling a preliminary artist's sketch of the
proposed 68,000-seat stadium.
</P>
<P>
   While the rendering revealed little about the construction
plans, the brick-and-steel design appears to have a retro flavor.
The architect, HOK Sport in Kansas City, Mo., is in the early
stages of the design.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the stadium would be built to optimize prime
</P>
<P>
   views, with a comparatively high proportion of seats, about 80
percent, along the sidelines, as opposed to the end zones.
</P>
<P>
   The 80 luxury suites would seat about 2,000 people and provide
amenities like bars, restrooms, private food services, and
televisions. All of the suites would be larger than the 42 suites
at Foxboro Stadium, and the eight largest, at about 1,800 square
feet, would be among the most spacious in the NFL. Suite owners,
who will pay $85,000 to $325,000 per season, would have designated
parking with entrances and exits designed to substantially shorten
the ride home.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots games would be the only admissions included in the
luxury suite deals. Owners would have to pay for admission to New
England Revolution games, concerts, and other events.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury suite owners are required to buy the suites for 10 years,
and are being asked to pay deposits as high as $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The new stadium also would have 6,000 club seats. The current
Foxboro Stadium has none. Officials said those customers would be
served by a lounge running the length of the stadium, with
televisions and large windows facing the field to allow fans to
watch the game when they leave their seats.
</P>
<P>
   No prices for the club seats or the 60,000 regular admission
seats have been determined, Patriots and NFL officials said. ``The
Patriots tickets have always been in about the middle of the ticket
prices around the NFL, and we expect that will continue,'' said
Patriots spokesman Stacey James.
</P>
<P>
   Team owner Robert Kraft, vice president Jonathan Kraft,
quarterback Drew Bledsoe, commissioner Tagliabue, BankBoston CEO
Charles ``Chad'' Gifford, and John J. Connors, chairman of Hill
Holliday Connors Cosmopulos, all spoke to representatives of 50
businesses at a breakfast meeting at BankBoston headquarters
Tuesday, hoping to spur suite sales.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe, who reportedly will earn $7 million next season and $8
million in 2000, later vowed to buy a luxury suite, joking that he
had a compelling, personal reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife won't have to listen to the comments when I throw an
interception,'' he quipped.
</P>
<P>
   The early luxury suite sales will provide a key source of
revenue for Kraft, who walked away from a deal to publicly finance
a stadium in Hartford earlier this year. Kraft is paying the $285
million construction cost, while the state pays for $70 million in
infrastructure improvements around the stadium. The NFL will loan
him $141 million for the construction, and allow him to repay that
amount from the share of the club seats that is normally given to
the visiting teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly looks like businesses are stepping up to the
plate, and we hope more businesses will buy into the luxury
seats,'' said Governor Paul Cellucci, who attended the meeting. The
level of business support, along with approval from municipal
officials in Foxborough, are the only remaining issues, Cellucci
said.

FLEET'S LENDING TO THE POOR, MINORITIES LAGS AFTER MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fleet Financial Group Inc. and BankBoston Corp. have trumpeted
their planned $16 billion merger as one in which the combined
company will do more than each institution alone to provide housing
loans to the poor and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``One plus one is greater than two,'' the banks' chief
executives have intoned, trying to assuage fears among community
groups that the new firm could slash lending and impoverish
recovering neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But a study released Tuesday on post-merger lending practices
suggests while BankBoston historically has adhered to that
arithmetic, Fleet has fallen strikingly short.
</P>
<P>
   The report, by University of Massachusetts at Boston economics
professor James Campen, suggests black, Latino, and low- to
middle-income borrowers are less likely to receive mortgage loans
from Fleet after it makes acquisitions. Fleet is buying its rival.
</P>
<P>
   The study is likely to serve as a rallying point for activists
who hope to force the banks to make commitments to poorer borrowers
before they merge later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet is viewed as more hard-nosed in its practices, while its
rival is seen as having a strong community image. Because the two
firms, to become the nation's eighth-largest bank, will have such a
big share of the New England market, the area is open to a net loss
in lower-income housing loans, Campen wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are excellent reasons for communities to insist and
regulators to require that the new institution be committed to
achieving its stated standard of `one plus one is greater than two'
for mortgage lending to traditionally underserved borrowers,''
Campen wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Campen, a specialist on the Community Reinvestment Act, the 1997
federal law that requires banks to lend to poorer areas, examined
data for Fleet after it acquired Shawmut National Bank in 1995 and
NatWest Bank NA a year later.
</P>
<P>
   He found that in 1998, Fleet made 334 mortgage loans to black
borrowers in Massachusetts _ 52.4 percent fewer than Fleet and
Shawmut made separately in 1995. Fleet made 335 mortgage loans to
lower-income borrowers in Boston last year _ 50.3 percent fewer
than Fleet and Shawmut made in 1995. Overall, Fleet's mortgage
lending to black, Latino, and lower-income borrowers in Boston
dropped by 40 percent from 1995 to 1998, Campen wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The decline was accompanied by a comparable fall in Fleet
mortgage loans to all borrowers, including affluent ones.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston, by contrast, continued to lend to poor and minority
borrowers at a strong rate after it acquired BayBanks Inc. in 1996.
The bank made as many loans to disadvantaged borrowers as the two
banks made before they merged _ even though BankBoston's lending to
affluent borrowers also declined.
</P>
<P>
   Campen said black borrowers in Boston received 143 home loans
from BankBoston in 1998 _ 16.3 percent more than in 1995 from
BankBoston and BayBanks. Boston Latinos took as many home loans
from BankBoston in 1998 as they did in 1995 from both banks.

CLINTON AIDE SAYS INTERNATIONAL TEAMWORK MUST CONTINUE DESPITE
SPYING SCANDAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal lawmakers must resist the temptation to
restrict visits by foreign scientists to the United States
following alleged Chinese spying at a U.S. laboratory, because such
a halt would harm national security, President Clinton's chief
science adviser said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Neal Lane, assailing congressional efforts to limit the visits
as ``xenophobic (and) misguided,'' called global scientific
cooperation important in preserving peace and essential in
combatting natural and man-made threats. International teamwork has
improved global understanding of climate change and other worldwide
environmental concerns, said Lane, assistant to the president for
science and technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Science must be a global undertaking,'' he said. ``We simply
cannot afford to isolate our national laboratories.''
</P>
<P>
   Lane, a former Rice University provost and physics professor in
Houston, cited as instrumental in the drive for peace the efforts
of U.S. scientists to give weapons specialists in the former Soviet
Union humanitarian outlets for their expertise. For example,
nuclear-arms experts have turned their attention to disposing of
weapons-grade plutonium, and scientists who had mixed biological
weapons have begun working on vaccines and cures for infectious
diseases, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lane's comments at an international science symposium followed
the introduction of legislation by Rep. Todd Tiahrt, R-Kan., that
would eliminate the Energy Department and transfer control of the
agency's national laboratories to Defense Department control.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., and Rep. Jim Ryun, R-Kan., have
introduced measures to prohibit scientists from countries that pose
a danger to the United States from visiting U.S. national
laboratories without special federal approval.
</P>
<P>
   The measures, which have yet to be considered by the full Senate
and House, were introduced after Wen Ho Lee, a Taiwanese-born
scientist, was fired in March from Los Alamos, N.M., National
Laboratory amid suspicion he was spying for China.
</P>
<P>
   Said Ryun, in defense of his proposal: ``Legislation is needed
to close the pipeline of vital national security secrets to China,
Iraq and other rogue nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Without specifically mentioning the congressional measures or
lawmakers, Lane assailed ``some of the things that are being said
that I don't think are careful and constructive.'' He noted that
Lee, who has not been arrested, was an employee of the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been no allegations that any foreign visitor has
been engaged in espionage,'' Lane said at the symposium on
scientific cooperation between the United States and the former
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   However, Lane conceded that U.S. enemies interested in American
technology might attempt to infiltrate the laboratories. Lane,
echoing comments from Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, said the
United States will increase efforts to bar foreign access to
sensitive and classified material at the laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important that we know where our visitors come from and
what they intend to do here,'' Lane said.

 &HT;    Amazon.com hiring for Georgia facility
 &HT;    By Anne Cowles

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Amazon.com Inc., the country's largest Web-based
bookseller, isn't wasting any time finding about 1,000 employees
for a new $51 million, 800,000-square-foot regional distribution
center in Henry County.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after it was announced Tuesday that Amazon.com selected
a site at Greenwood Industrial Park in McDonough, Ga., the online
retailer scheduled a three-day open house beginning Friday at the
city's Windy Hill Recreation Center for prospective employees.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com will open the facility later this summer and hire 500
employees by the end of the year. It plans to have a work force of
about 1,000 by the end of March 2000. It could become the largest
industrial employer in Henry County. Home-grown Snapper Power
Equipment in McDonough currently is the largest business, with
close to 900 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This facility will be the largest Amazon.com center to date in
the United States,'' said Jim Wright, the company's chief logistics
officer. ``It will be a highly mechanized facility ... within
excess of 12 miles of conveyor system.''
</P>
<P>
   The distribution center will serve the southeastern United
States, as well as South America and Mexico. The full line of
Amazon.com merchandise, including books, CDs and DVDs, will be
housed at the facility.
</P>
<P>
   Henry County Commission Chairman Jim Joyner said his county is
now firmly planted as a player in technology business. ``Amazon.com
just adds to the fact that Henry County is moving into the era of
technology business,'' Joyner said. ``And now I believe we can be
known in the business world as Henry County.com.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes, first in a long line of speakers at Tuesday's
announcement, said Amazon.com's selection of McDonough confirms
metro Atlanta's position as a center of e-commerce. ``The point is
this: Whatever you can find on the Internet, you can find in
Georgia,'' Barnes said. ``Whatever you can find in Silicon Valley,
in the Research Triangle, on Boston's Route 128, you can
increasingly find here in Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos opened the Seattle-based company
in 1995 when he began shipping books out of his garage. Today the
company has six distribution centers around the country, including
McDonough.
</P>
<P>
   Initial site analysis indicated that north metro Atlanta would
be a prime spot for the distribution center. But traffic congestion
led Amazon.com to look south of I-20.
</P>
<P>
   Henry County had a 400,000-square-foot speculative industrial
building that could easily be expanded to fit Amazon.com's needs.
``Without a speculative building they would not have been looking
down here,'' said Jeff Lucas, economic development specialist for
the Henry County Development Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, which gives stock options to all employees, needs
workers skilled in distribution center work, including unloading
trucks, picking orders and driving forklifts. Between 40 and 60
management positions are available, with two-thirds likely to be
filled locally.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com has set up a toll-free job line at 877-975-4273. The
company is accepting applications by e-mail at gajobs(AT)amazon.com
and will answer questions by e-mail at gaquestions(AT)amazon.com.

U.S. SEEKS WAY TO APOLOGIZE TO CHINA FOR EMBASSY BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Finding a way to talk to China is difficult enough
for the Clinton administration these days. Finding a way to
apologize to China is turning out to be just about impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since a B-2 bomber accidentally struck the Chinese Embassy
in Belgrade in early May, the administration has been talking about
sending a mission to Beijing to explain, in person, how the use of
an outdated map led to tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   There is urgency in the mission. Until the bombing is cleared
up, the Chinese have said, most interchanges with Washington are on
hold _ including talks over China's admission into the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials said on Tuesday that the
delegation would probably leave for Beijing this weekend. ``But
that may be optimistic,'' one administration official said, noting
that the intelligence agencies, the State Department and the
National Security Council are ``are still debating exactly what to
say.'' In fact, the administration has tied itself in knots over
who should deliver the mea culpa and exactly how detailed an
accounting should be provided.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the question of how to finesse Beijing's
demand that those responsible be publicly identified and punished _
a sensitive question at the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency
and the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, each of which has been
blamed for some portion of the error.
</P>
<P>
   After considerable debate, the White House appears to have
settled on a messenger: Thomas Pickering, the undersecretary of
state and former ambassador to India, Russia and the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   At a high-level meeting of President Clinton's advisers last
week, several officials questioned whether Pickering, while one of
Washington's most experienced diplomats, was high-ranking enough to
satisfy the status-conscious Chinese. Some officials at the meeting
wondered if it would be wiser to send a bigger name _ Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, perhaps, or National Security Adviser
Samuel Berger.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright is busy with Kosovo and does not get along that
well with the Chinese. The Chinese would prefer Berger, said
another official familiar with the internal debate, but he is also
busy with Kosovo and has been criticized for not warning Clinton
earlier about suspicions that China had stolen nuclear secrets from
U.S. weapons labs.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., said on Tuesday that Berger would
be formally invited to appear before the Intelligence Committee to
answer three questions: ``What did he know, when did he know it and
what did he tell the president about the espionage?''
</P>
<P>
   The administration officia said, ``I'm not sure that a headline
reading `Berger Apologizes to Chinese' is exactly what the White
House has in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Some have suggested sending outgoing Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin, who has particularly good relations with the Chinese _ even
though he opposed closing a deal on WTO entry in April during the
visit of Prime Minister Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese like Rubin because, unlike Albright, he has not
hectored them much about human rights, and he praised them
repeatedly last year for keeping the value of their currency
stable, which helped choke off the Asian economic crisis. But with
one foot out the door, Rubin has made clear that his summer plans
call for taking his 11 fly-fishing rods for some lengthy forays,
rather than being chewed out in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest fear in the State Department is that the Chinese
will find the whole explanation of the bombing, which killed three
Chinese citizens, less than convincing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a story of incredible technical sophistication combined
with incredible ineptitude,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   But already the administration is thinking about the next chess
move after Pickering's mission. At the Trade Representative's
office, teams of officials are poised to start up negotiations on
the trade issues as soon as possible _ fearing that any delay could
doom the whole idea in Congress, where debate over China is already
raging.

PANASONIC IN DEAL TO MAKE DIGITAL RECORDERS FOR REPLAY
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif.)  (jw) 
 By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Replay Networks, one of two makers of digital video recorders,
has signed an agreement with the Panasonic Consumer Electronics Co.
to make its new systems, the companies announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Replay's rival, Tivo Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif., already has a
similar agreement for its Personal TV Receiver with Royal Philips
Electronics NV.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement helps expand Panasonic's reach in digital consumer
electronics and broadens the distribution for Replay's product,
called ReplayTV. Panasonic plans to offer the new set-top boxes in
stores this fall in time for the Christmas season. Replay's
recorders are already available from the company on the Internet
and a toll-free telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   Tivo's recorder will be available in some consumer electronics
stores in July.
</P>
<P>
   Both Replay and Tivo's set-top boxes take a step toward blending
the power of computers with television. A receiver converts
television signals from cable, satellite or antennas, digitizes the
signal and saves it on a hard drive. No videotapes are needed.
Customers can create custom ``channels'' supported by filtering
software that automatically records all programs on specified
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The systems permit digital rewind, fast-forward and pause
features for both recordings and live television. Such digital
technology makes it possible, explained Jim Plant, marketing
director for Replay, for a viewer who begins watching a program 10
minutes after it started, to rewind to the beginning of the show
and view the entire program slowly or fast-forward to present time.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, both systems use a dial-up telephone connection
that downloads television listing information.
</P>
<P>
   Now, systems from Replay, based in Palo Alto, Calif., will store
up to 28 hours of video. The hardware price ranges from $699 for 10
hours of viewing to $1,499 for 28 hours. The ReplayTV service,
subsidized by advertising, offers a week's worth of television
listings.
</P>
<P>
   For customers, any upgrades to the systems will automatically be
downloaded at no charge, so buying new hardware will not be
necessary, Plant said.
</P>
<P>
   For Panasonic, the Replay service adds another product to its
digital lineup of televisions, camcorders, videodisk players and CD
players. The company hopes that sales of such products will offset
sagging sales of its more mature product lines like traditional
VCRs, and analog television sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this as one of the key categories as we move forward,''
said Andrew Nelkin, general manager of Panasonic's consumer video
division.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, Replay plans to add an interactive component to
the system, allowing viewers to buy products, much as they can on
the Internet.

SECOND N.Y. OFFICER FOUND GUILTY IN LOUIMA CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A second police officer was put behind bars Tuesday
for the torture and sodomy of Haitian immigrant Abner Louima, while
three others who had been accused of involvement in the crime were
set free.
</P>
<P>
   However, the case that shocked the nation and threw the city
into its worst fit of racial tensions in over a decade was far from
closed.
</P>
<P>
   A Brooklyn jury Tuesday found Officer Charles Schwarz guilty of
holding down Louima in the bathroom of a Brooklyn stationhouse
while his fellow officer, Justin Volpe, sodomized Louima with a
stick.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe pleaded guilty to the crime two weeks ago, after four
other officers testified that he had told them what he did. Volpe
and Schwarz are in federal custody and could receive life
sentences. Schwarz's lawyer said he would appeal the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   However, shortly after Tuesday's verdict, Marvyn Kornberg,
Volpe's lawyer, said that the jury convicted the wrong man _ that
Schwarz was not in the bathroom at the time of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   And in another development, US Attorney Zachary Carter said a
second criminal trial will soon take place, charging three
officers, Schwarz and two of the officers acquitted Tuesday, with
conspiring to cover up the assault.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict came after a six-week trial that recalled the events
of Aug. 9, 1997, when Volpe arrested Louima, a Haitian immigrant,
outside a Brooklyn nightclub, then took him to the bathroom of the
70th precinct stationhouse, assaulted him with the stick, smashed
it against his teeth, and threatened to kill him if he ever told
anybody what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Two other officers _ Thomas Wiese and Thomas Bruder _ were found
not guilty of charges that they beat Louima in a patrol car.
Sergeant Michael Bellomo was acquitted of making false statements
about Volpe's assault.
</P>
<P>
   When Volpe pleaded guilty three weeks into the trial, he
confessed to committing the crime ``in the presence of another
police officer,'' but did not name the officer. The jurors were not
in the courtroom during the plea.
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg said in a phone interview Tuesday that before Volpe
took the plea, he privately told the prosecutors and Schwarz's
lawyer who the other police officer was _ and said he would repeat
the name if called to testify in court.
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg would not say, in the interview, whom Volpe had named,
but he did say, ``It was not Officer Schwarz.'' Asked if this meant
the jury convicted the wrong man Tuesday, Kornberg replied,
``That's absolutely right.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked by reporters outside the courthouse if it was true that
Volpe named an officer other than Schwarz, Carter replied, ``As a
participant in the bathroom assault, no.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if Volpe had said another officer saw what he was
doing and did nothing to stop him, even if he did not participate
directly, Carter replied, ``I'm not going to respond to that
because that's going to be the subject matter of the next trial.''
</P>
<P>
   One criminal charge was set aside during the trial that ended
Tuesday _ accusing Schwarz, Wiese and Bruder of conspiring to make
false statements about what happened to Louima in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said this charge will be refiled in a second criminal
trial, to take place in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who is representing Louima in a
civil lawsuit against the city, said of Tuesday's verdict, ``We
think some measure of justice was obtained,'' and added that he
hoped other officers would be convicted in the trial to come.
</P>
<P>
   Wiese and Bruder were acquitted Tuesday of charges that they
beat Louima in a patrol car. Carter said it is very difficult to
make such charges stick when the only witness is the victim.
Cochran agreed, and praised the prosecutors' performance, calling
Volpe's guilty plea and Schwarz's conviction ``clearly a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, who has often appeared at Louima's side,
did so again Tuesday, telling a crowd at his Harlem headquarters,
``We're going to fight for you until all the guilty see justice.''
Louima's cousin, Sam Nicolas, told the gathering, ``We want to act
for peace, for calm.''

 &HT;    Toys `R' Us unveils redesign with test store
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Toys ``R'' Us isn't playing games with its new store
format.
</P>
<P>
   As other retailers introduce online toy stores to battle Toys
``R'' Us in cyberspace, the Paramus, N.J., chain has been busy
polishing its bricks and mortar. In a massive remodeling project
that began in October, Toys ``R'' Us is taking down the towering
racks and replacing the familiar warehouse look with a softer
discount department store feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old stores are claustrophobic,'' said Chief Executive
Robert Nakasone on a tour Wednesday at a Toys ``R'' Us near North
Point Mall in Alpharetta, Ga. ``Now we've got a layout that's much
easier to shop.''
</P>
<P>
   The Alpharetta store is one of nine in the Southeast with the
new look. Toys ``R'' Us chose the Southeast as a test market
because of its major distribution center in McDonough, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The Alpharetta tour, which was followed by a meeting with 300
vendors, marked one of Nakasone's first public statements since he
became CEO last year. The tour coincides with the company's annual
shareholder meeting today at the Westin Atlanta North near
Perimeter Mall. The company held its annual meeting here to
showcase the Alpharetta store.
</P>
<P>
   The new store format features fewer toys but a better
presentation, Nakasone said. The retailer cut back-room space by a
third to make room for wider aisles and new departments. Each
department targets a different age group. For example, ``juvenile
world'' aims to lure mothers and babies with its pastel green
colors and new line of toddler clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research shows that apparel drives 30 percent of a
mother's shopping trips, so we're trying to capitalize on that,''
Nakasone said. It's also a way to generate more year-round sales
for a retailer that depends on seasonal traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The attitude switches in the sports department, where Toys ``R''
Us is trying to grab the attention of teenagers with wild graphics
and lots of skateboards.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges of a more cheeky generation is evident in the
department that targets girls. Barbie, it seems, has given up shelf
space to more mature fancies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole toy industry is facing the fact that kids are
growing up faster than they used to,'' Nakasone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You used to be able to give a Barbie to a girl anywhere from
age 2 to 10. Now they're outgrowing Barbie at 5 or 6 years old, and
that's compressing our business,'' Nakasone said.
</P>
<P>
   Like other retailers, Toys ``R'' Us is pushing Barbie fashion
instead. Cosmetics, jewelry and miniskirt outfits for girls who
want to look like Barbie make up the bulk of the department.
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us is combining the new prototypes with a big push on
the Internet as it faces increasing competition. Amazon.com is
introducing an online toy store this month. EToys, based in Santa
Monica, Calif., is off to a heady stock market start after going
public last month.
</P>
<P>
   The timing is crucial for both the Internet and store
initiatives. Toys ``R'' Us, which had flat sales of $11.2 billion
in 1998, lost sales to Wal-Mart and other discounters that sell
toys at bargain prices. Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer,
surpassed Toys ``R'' Us last year as the biggest U.S. toy retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Amid restructuring charges that contributed to a $132 million
loss in 1998, Nakasone has been shutting stores, firing workers and
reducing inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Those cost-cutting efforts have been coupled with a plan for the
revamped store layout.
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us spent roughly $6 million to re-do the nine stores
with the new layout, Nakasone said. It will spend up to $700,000
per store to revamp another 185 to 200 stores this year and another
325 next year.
</P>
<P>
   The compnay has 700 stores in the United States. In metro
Atlanta, Toys ``R'' Us will remodel three more of its nine stores
this year but hasn't identified which ones.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An end to the war in Kosovo crept closer Tuesday
with agreement among the United States, six allies and Russia on a
plan to send peacekeepers into the shattered province, perhaps in a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Russians, who had resisted certain provisions
of the plan, dropped their objections at a conference in Cologne,
Germany, NATO and Yugoslav generals reopened crucial negotiations
at a remote site in Macedonia on detailed provisions for a
withdrawal of Serbian troops from Kosovo. Negotiations on that
subject had broken down over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Pentagon said there were signs that Serbian
troops were preparing to withdraw, although none had begun to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Cook, the British foreign secretary, said in Cologne that
a Serb withdrawal and a suspension of the NATO bombing campaign
could take place ``in the next few days.'' Joschka Fischer, the
German foreign minister, said the Cologne agreement represented ``a
very decisive step toward peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was more guarded in
public, but she told officials in Washington that she had ``had a
very good day.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, important questions remain. Among the most
important was what an American diplomat termed ``a double
Catch-22.'' The Yugoslavs were still insisting that they would not
agree to withdrawal procedures until the U.N. Security Council had
acted upon the Cologne agreement, which is in the form of a draft
UN resolution that could be adopted as early as Wednesday. The
Russians and the Chinese, both with vetos, do not want the Security
Council to act until a bombing pause is in effect, and the United
States and its NATO partners want to verify that a phased Serb
withdrawal is underway, in accordance with a detailed understanding
with the Yugoslav military, before agreeing to a pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not at all clear how we are going to untie that knot,''
a senior American official said, ``but we're reasonably sure we can
manage it.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight day, President Clinton telephoned
Russian President Boris Yeltsin in an effort to push the peace plan
forward, and he also sent Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott,
a Russian expert, back to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the sequence of agreements, votes and withdrawal,
Talbott has another problem to resolve: the role of Russian troops
in the peacekeeping force and who will command them. NATO is eager,
as ever, to have a unified command-and-control system, with a
single man in charge; the United States is particualrly wary of any
ambiguity, given its unhappy experience in a United Nations force
in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, on the other hand, would like to have its troops under
United Nations rather than NATO control, and has suggested placing
them along Kosovo's northern border, with the rest of the
peacekeeping force to the south. This has raised serious
apprehensions in the West of a de facto partition of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Tuesday that he did not expect Russian troops to
fall directly under NATO control, but hoped that ``there will be an
acceptable level of coordination the way we worked it out in
Bosnia.'' He added, ``I think it's very important for the Russians
to be involved in this'' _ at least in part, presumably, because of
long-standing Russian ties to the Yugoslavs.
</P>
<P>
   The president continued to sound what he called ``some note of
caution'' despite the day's developments, emphasizing that
arrangements were not yet in place that would guarantee the safe
repatriation of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Missing from the agreement at Cologne, which in most other
respects replicated an accord signed by President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia last week, was a footnote in the earlier
agreement specifying that the peacekeeping force would have ``NATO
at the core.'' Also missing was language specifying that a unified
NATO chain of command would be under the political control of the
NATO nations, ``in consultation with non-NATO force contributors.''
</P>
<P>
   Some American officials said the absence of that language
signified nothing, but others said it could present serious
problems down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem centers on Serbian insistence that, since the
peace framework recognizes Yugoslav sovereignty in Kosovo, Serbian
officials should be present at the border when ethnic Albanians
begin to cross back into the province. NATO opposes that, on the
ground that it could only intimidate the refugees who have been
driven from their homes in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The place to come back is through border crossings,'' said
Nebojsa Vujovic, the foreign ministry spokesman in Belgrade,
referring to posts manned in part by Serbian officials. ``There
should be border crossings and customs officials to make sure there
are not Albanian people who might be fishing in the mud and
terrorists who might come over the mountains chasing Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Many refugees have no papers, their Serbian tormentors having
destroyed them, and it is not clear how it would be possible to
tell ethnic Albanians from Albanian nationals, for example. But
Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, said he did not foresee any
problem, and other American officials said they were determined to
deny the Serbs a role at the border.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another administration official said that regardless of what the
Serbs want, the peace-keeping force eventually would control the
borders and that the U.N. High Commission for Refugees would
oversee the resettlement of hundreds of thousands of refugees. The
refugees' lack of papers, he said, should not complicate their
return. The bigger challenge, he said, is to create conditions,
including food, shelter, sanitation and security, that will permit
their safe return.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Over the horizon, but perhaps only by a week or 10 days, is an
even larger question, that of a civilian representative in Kosovo
after the peacekeepers enter. That has been a significant problem
in Bosnia. While it is obvious that the representative would have
broad powers _ something like those of a proconsul, perhaps on the
pattern of John J. McCloy as high commissioner in occupied Germany,
beginning in 1949 _ many other things remain to be decided.
</P>
<P>
   The exact job description, the chain of command and who will
fill the post are all up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United
States _ the G7 countries _ all signed the Cologne agreement, along
with Russia. But after the Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov,
affixed his signature, he said that the participation of Russian
peacekeepers was not yet assured.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, said that the American contingent
in the peacekeeping force would include 1,900 marines from the 26th
Marine Expeditionary Force now on board ships in the Aegean Sea as
well as 1,700 Army personnel, including an aviation unit with at
least eight Apache attack helicopters now in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the force could number as many as 55,000 troops,
including 7,000 Americans. The Russians might contribute as many as
10,000. Already, there are 17,000 British, French, German and other
troops in Macedonia, and they would presumably form the vanguard of
the international force.
</P>
<P>
   At his daily briefing, Bacon said that United States
intelligence had picked up signs that the Serbs were mobilizing
heavy transport vehicles in Kosovo, which he described as a sign
that Serb forces were preparing to pull out. There are an estimated
40,000 Serb army, police and paramilitary forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But until they start moving, in keeping with an agreed
timetable, Bacon and his NATO counterpart, Jamie Shea, made clear
that NATO airstrikes will continue. Most of the 222 bombing strikes
overnight Monday, Shea said in Brussels, targeted Serb forces near
the Albanian border. Eight-engine B-52 bombers hit suspected Serb
troop concentrations there again Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday night, while the peacekeeping force commander, Lt.
Gen. Michael Jackson of the British army, was meeting with Yugoslav
generals in Macedonia, NATO strike aircraft attacked again, on the
77th day of the air war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to prematurely surrender the pressure of air
operations and wait for President Milosevic to move,'' Shea
declared.

REBELS POSITION THEMSELVES TO BECOME KOSOVO'S NEW ARMY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ When the separatist rebels of the Kosovo
Liberation Army launched what they called a major offensive near
here two weeks ago, the strategy was basic: to open a supply
corridor from Albania into Kosovo and to cut off a highway so that
Yugoslav troops could not move between two major cities in southern
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But much has happened in those two weeks. NATO planes have
apparently helped out in the rebels' effort around Mount Pastrik,
which is on the border between Kosovo and Albania. Again on
Tuesday, NATO dropped bombs of enormous power on the Yugoslav
positions within sight of the Albanian border.
</P>
<P>
   And a peace agreement is in the works that would require the
Yugoslav troops to withdraw within days, making the fight for a
supply corridor seem irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   But with the possibility that the Yugoslav troops will withdraw,
the rebel force is positioning itself to be the province's new army
_ and it seems to be working to prove that it deserves that role in
what may be the conflict's final days.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Serbs withdraw from Kosovo, it's not going to be the
Kosovo Liberation Army,'' said Masar Shala, a spokesman for the
rebel group here. ``It will be the regular army. Maybe it won't be
the same people. It can have a different name. But there must be an
army.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the battles in recent days have been hard
fought, with constant shelling by both sides as well as
hand-to-hand fighting, said officials of the rebel group here. On
any day in the last two weeks, it has been possible to stand at the
Albanian border with Kosovo and to watch shells land, most of them
on rebel positions, and more recently to see bombs from NATO fall,
most of them on Yugoslav positions, except for a few mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   On the Serbian side, too, the fighting has been fierce. The
Yugoslav military has spent much of the last year _ as well as the
last crumbs of its international respect _ trying to eradicate the
rebels in the Kosovo province of Serbia, which is the major entity
in Yugoslavia. Until a peace document is signed, the Serbs appear
unwilling to let up.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels say that they have a similar motive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to continue our duty to liberate Kosovo,'' said a
top rebel commander. ``The KLA must continue its attacks on the
Serbs and destroy as much as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels also appear to be fighting for respect. Their army is
often derided by military analysts as disorganized and poorly
trained, despite what the Pentagon says are improvements recently
under a new field commander, Adem Ceku, who has experience fighting
Serbs in the Croatian army. Even with NATO essentially bombing the
way forward into Kosovo, the rebel offensive here has only pushed
through a few miles in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Mount Pastrik, the KLA failed to make significant
inroads,'' Kenneth Bacon, a Pentagon spokesman, said in Washington
on Tuesday. ``They're in Kosovo, but they're pinned down.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have had more success, Bacon said, in intense
fighting in northwestern Kosovo, in the Junik area, where 3,500
rebel fighters have been battling 2,500 Yugoslav forces over the
last week to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon says its ambitions for the rebel group _ which
American officials until recently called a terrorist group _ are
not so high as those of the rebels. It would like the soldiers to
become a police force. With a peace plan that requires the rebels
to demilitarize, this issue may be only one of many on which the
rebels and Western leaders find themselves at odds.
</P>
<P>
   By fortunate timing for the rebels, the battle around Mount
Pastrik does appear to put them in an ideal position to move into
Kosovo rapidly when and if a peace deal is signed. The rebel group
will not say how many soldiers it has in the area, but it probably
has several thousand.
</P>
<P>
   Many are fighting on the Kosovo side of the border, but there
are also many more in Albania, in what rebel officials call
``transit'' areas and the Serbs call military camps. For the last
two weeks, the Serbs have been shelling border towns in Albania,
apparently trying to destroy the rebels' rear guard, the men who
could follow the soldiers doing the actual fighting in Kosovo.

HASTERT PEP TALK CAN'T UNITE REPUBLICANS ON SPENDING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Texas., Mo., Fla., Okla.)  (mk) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Speaker Dennis Hastert, pleading for unity, told
fellow Republicans Tuesday that they must stick together and pass
the party's major bills or risk losing their majority in the House.
</P>
<P>
   But despite a public display of mutual respect among the
Republicans after Hastert's pep talk, they are still deeply divided
over how to pass $538 billion in spending bills to finance the
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a long, hot summer,'' said the majority whip,
Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas. ``We all know that. It's going to be very
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 20-minute closed-door speech to the House Republican
conference, Hastert cracked no whips, twisted no arms and laid down
no laws. Paraphrasing Benjamin Franklin, the speaker said the
Republicans had to hang together or they would assuredly hang
separately.
</P>
<P>
   He asked them to ``give your leadership the benefit of the doubt
and just follow,'' according to members who were there. He urged
them to ``search your heart _ search your conscience,'' to put
aside the politics that have torn conservatives and moderates
asunder, ``and then decide to join us.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he warned that the stakes were high. ``Whether you
call it political, whether you call it the fiscal future of this
country or whether you call it the moral future of this country,
we're at the crossroads and that's what we're talking about in this
thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert reminded the Republicans of their precarious 223-211
majority, and warned that they could lose the House next year if
they did not govern the Legislature, govern themselves and pass the
spending bills _ the only thing Congress is legally required to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``This notion that we're a do-nothing Congress sinks in after a
while,'' said Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill. He said Hastert made ``a
compelling argument that if we want to stay the majority, we've got
to act like the governing party.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, all the spending bills have been stalled. The main
stumbling block has been conservative Republicans who want all
domestic spending frozen or cut, and all Social Security surpluses
saved.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert offered no financial details of his plans to win passage
for the year's major spending bills. Republican aides say he will
shift more than $5 billion from bills financing the Defense,
Treasury and Agriculture Departments, Congress and military
construction, and move the money into bills for the Labor,
Education, Health and Human Services Departments and other domestic
programs, which took deep cuts in the Republican budget plan.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to mollify moderate Republicans who say those cuts
are too deep, while assuring conservatives that the strict budget
caps approved by Congress and the White House in 1997 will remain
in place.
</P>
<P>
   But the strategy may be doomed. Many Republicans say there is
simply too little money to pass the bills under the caps. Shuffling
a few billion dollars, says the staff director of the House
Appropriations Committee, James Dyer, is like rearranging the deck
chairs on the Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   So Hastert and DeLay have a fallback plan, key aides said
Tuesday: Let the appropriations process fail.
</P>
<P>
   Then they would try to force Democrats to create a spending plan
that breaks the budget caps, soaks up Social Security surpluses and
gives the Republicans a campaign issue for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans will demagogue on Social Security and we're
prepared to fight that battle,'' a senior Republican aide warned
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Their argument against the Democrats would be: `` `You're the
party of school lunches, we're the party of Social Security,' '' he
said. ``We will tag them as big spenders. We'll be able to define
ourself on two potent political issues: Save Social Security,
balance the budget. If we don't, we'll be the ones who didn't
balance it, and who raided Social Security, in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats may not fall for this strategy. ``It's their budget,''
said the minority leader, Dick Gephardt, D-Mo. ``They're going to
have to pass it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans said they were baffled by the lack of details
in Hastert's new spending plan, which appears to be a work in
progress. The plan was not cleared in advance with Rep. C.W. Bill
Young of Florida, the chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee, which controls the 13 spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't understand how this new strategy works,'' said
Elizabeth Morra, a spokeswoman for the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Edward Porter, R-Ill., chairman of the appropriations
subcommittee for the Labor, Health and Human Services, and
Education departments, said an extra 2 or 3 billion dollars would
not help his bill that much. His appropriation was cut by nearly
$11 billion by House leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan, or its goals, won over a key conservative, Rep.
Tom Coburn, R-Okla. ``The proof,'' he said, ``will be in the
details and how we stay together.''
</P>
<P>
   And by winning over Coburn, Hastert unlocked the first major
spending bill to reach the House floor, a $60.8 billion measure for
agriculture programs.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Coburn, a family physician, singlehandedly
stalled the agriculture bill in the name of the Social Security
surplus. It increased spending for the coming year, and that was
intolerable, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Young cut $102.5 million from the bill on the House
floor, and Coburn withdrew the legislative roadblocks he had
erected.
</P>
<P>
   But then the doctor, showing the power of conservatives to shape
the spending bills, won an amendment barring the Food and Drug
Administration from testing, developing or approving the use of the
abortion drug RU-486. The amendment passed by a 217-214 vote after
three Republicans, at the behest of DeLay, switched their votes
from nay to yea at the last minute.

SENATE PASSES DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS PACKAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Alaska, Iowa, Calif.)   (bl)  
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate passed a $265 billion appropriations
bill for the Pentagon by a 93-4 vote on Tuesday night. The measure
includes a pay increase for military personnel and the authority to
lease luxurious executive jets for generals.
</P>
<P>
   By voice vote, the Senate added an amendment that would bar the
United States from spending any money to help reconstruct Serbia so
long as Slobodan Milosevic remains president of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   A second amendment, also approved by a voice vote, would bar the
use of emergency funds approved in May for military operations
against Yugoslavia for any reconstruction projects, whether in
Serbia or Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The appropriations bill finances new weapons, military
operations and Pentagon personnel costs for the coming year. It
does not include money for military construction or the Energy
Department's nuclear weapons programs, which together will boost
the costs of military spending for the coming year to close to $290
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed on Tuesday night includes an across-the-board
4.8 percent pay increase for military personnel. It now goes to the
House, which has not brought military spending bills to the floor
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also resurrected a bid by the Air Force to win the
authority to lease six top-of-the-line Gulfstream executive jets
for military brass, at a cost that could run to nearly $500 million
over 10 years. The measure had been included in, and then withdrawn
from, the nearly $15 billion emergency supplemental bill passed by
Congress in May that financed NATO's air war in Yugoslavia and
added unrequested billions to the Pentagon's budget.
</P>
<P>
   The jets would be used by the Pentagon's nine unified and
regional commanders-in-chief, six of whom have headquarters in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, said the jets were needed to keep the
commanders from flying ``old Dumbos,'' aging 707 aircraft that he
said were antiquated and expensive to maintain. ``It would save
money in the long run,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, called the measure ``government
waste at its worst.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The American taxpayer should not be forced to pick up the tab
for this silver-starred perk,'' Harkin said. His amendment to block
the leasing authority, co-sponsored by Sen. Barbara Boxer,
D-Calif., was defeated, 66-31.

   Automakers and Union Eager for Long-Term Deal
</P>
<P>
   With General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler scheduled to begin
talks next week with the United Automobile Workers union, it
appears increasingly likely that negotiators will seek a national
labor contract lasting four or more years, the longest such deal
since the 1950's, auto executives and union officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Chastened by a strike last summer against GM and enjoying the
soaring profits and bountiful overtime pay produced by record auto
sales, management and workers appear eager to avoid another
showdown this year. The UAW would also be able to avoid having the
next round of auto labor talks in the summer of 2002, when the
union could be locked in a power struggle after the retirement of
its president, Stephen Yokich.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, Intel Agrees to Limit Jobs
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual arrangement that reflects both the flush national
economy and Oregon's particular obsession with controlling sprawl,
Intel has agreed to pay a fee if it exceeds a ceiling of 1,000 new
manufacturing jobs on top of the 4,000 it already has in Washington
County, part of the Portland metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   More IBM Testimony on Microsoft
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft executive told IBM privately in 1997 that the
computer maker would pay a lower price for Microsoft's Windows
operating system if it did not ship a competing Internet browser,
an IBM executive, Garry Norris, testified in the Microsoft
antitrust trial.

   Replay Networks in Panasonic Deal
</P>
<P>
   Replay Networks has signed an agreement with Panasonic Consumer
Electronics to make its new digital video recorders systems and

<P>
   Prescription Plan Draws Skepticism
</P>
<P>
   Drug industry and insurance executives reacted with skepticism
to White House plans for a new prescription drug benefit for all
elderly Americans. Drug manufacturers said they did not believe the
assurances of administration officials that the proposal would not
lead to price controls on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   GM to Buy Bank of New York Unit
</P>
<P>
   General Motors agreed to buy Bank of New York's commercial
lending unit for $1.8 billion as the auto maker diversifies its
holdings and the bank continues to specialize its operations. For
Bank of New York, the deal fits a pattern of concentrating on
fee-based operations. Its shares rose $2.375, to $37.0625, while GM
fell $1.375, to $67.75.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Panel Backs New Alliances
</P>
<P>
   In a move that would transform how legal services are provided,
a special panel of the American Bar Association recommended
abandoning decades-old rules that have prevented lawyers from
setting up partnerships with accountants, consultants and other
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Air Passengers Told to Be Punctual
</P>

at least 10 minutes before scheduled departure _ or risk being left

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Revised figures showed that worker productivity rose 3.5 percent
in the first quarter, less than the 4 percent previously estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Change-Over at Economic Council
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said that they would most likely nominate

3 SAFETY MEASURES ABSENT FROM ARKANSAS RUNWAY WHERE PLANE CRASHED
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ark. N.Y.)  (jw) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One of the problems for the airliner that skidded
off the runway and crashed last week at the airport in Little Rock,
Ark., appears to be a string of bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   The government provides money for three safety measures designed
to eliminate or reduce the risk of such accidents. But none of
those steps had been taken in Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,000-foot buffer zone now required at the end of runways is
not in place in Little Rock because construction of the runway
began before the rule took effect. The airport does not have
breakaway light poles, common at the edges of airports, because the
flood-prone ground is too soft. And it does not yet have a safety
trap, called an arrestor bed, although one was approved before the
June 1 accident.
</P>
<P>
   Nine people, including the captain, were killed in the crash,
and 80 were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The runway that was used by the plane, American Airlines Flight
1420, lacked the 1,000-foot buffer zone required on new runways
since Jan. 1, 1988, even though it opened in 1991. But because work
on the runway began in the early 1980s, the airport did not have to
comply with that rule, Federal Aviation Administration officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The overrun area for the runway, 4 Right, was 450 feet. The jet
went through that area, smashed into stanchions holding lights that
direct planes approaching from the opposite direction, and broke up
and caught fire.
</P>
<P>
   The parallel runway has such a 1,000-foot area, recently
expanded from 766 feet, when it was rehabilitated. But 4 Right, old
enough to be grandfathered, is too young to be rehabilitated and
thus still is not subject to the rule, which requires 1,000 feet
wherever practical. Exactly how far the zone could have been
extended on 4 Right is uncertain, because the Arkansas River's
flood plain is off the northeast end.
</P>
<P>
   But for the very spot where the crash occurred, the airport has
already been promised money from the FAA for an arrestor bed,
designed to catch and safely stop airplanes doing just what
American's MD-80 did, overrun the end of the runway. The project is
supposed to be built next year, at a cost of $1 million to $1.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   At the National Transportation Safety Board, which is in charge
of the investigation, officials are still trying to determine why
devices on the wings that help cut lift after landing, called
spoilers, did not deploy. On the MD-80, standard procedure is to
``arm'' the spoilers by setting a control in the cockpit before
landing, allowing the spoilers to pop up when the plane's wheels
start spinning. Reducing lift gives the wheels more traction as the
plane's weight settles on them.
</P>
<P>
   The first officer, who survived the crash, told investigators
that he saw the captain arm the spoilers, but the flight data
recorder indicates they were never deployed. Experts say that
investigators may be able to hear the sound of the spoilers being
armed on the cockpit voice recorder.
</P>
<P>
   George Black Jr., the member of the board in charge at the
scene, said there was no mention of the spoilers on the tape. But
investigators say that this does not establish that they were not
armed.
</P>
<P>
   The runway that the plane used is 7,200 feet long, on the short
side for an MD-80, which is known to pilots as a heavy plane with
relatively low aerodynamic drag, and thus harder to stop. Airport
engineers had to fit it into a space 8,650 feet long, because the
flood plain of the Arkansas River is at the northeast end. They did
take 1,000 feet for a buffer zone, but they put it at the other end
of the runway, so it is a buffer for planes coming in the other
direction, in which case the runway is called 22 Left. (Runways are
named by compass heading.)
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear why the plane used the runway, 4
Right, instead of 4 Left, which is 1,000 feet longer. Both were
available that night, according to an airport spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, lighting stanchions like the ones that Flight 1420
hit are supposed to be designed to break away on impact, so they do
not break up the airplane, as happened in this case. But the
stanchions that this plane hit sit in the flood plain of the
Arkansas River, and their bases had to be made sturdier to avoid
having them tilt or fall, according to FAA officials.
</P>
<P>
   Arrestor systems, first put in use at Kennedy and La Guardia
airports in New York, are rare. One at Kennedy got its first
operational use last month, saving a commuter plane from taxiing
into the water at the end of a runway. Asked if they were often
considered by airport managers, David Bennett, the director of the
FAA's office of airport safety and standards, said, ``If it wasn't
before, it probably is now.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Officials in Little Rock reopened the runway Tuesday, although
for planes landing in the opposite direction, it is available for
visual approaches only, since the MD-80 destroyed some navigation
equipment at the far end.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators, meanwhile, continued to examine the wreckage of
the plane, some of which was inaccessible until it was moved off
the field. Matthew Furhman, a spokesman for the National
Transportation Safety Board, said that part of the landing gear,
for example, was only now available for study.

 &HT;    Refugees wary about peace prospect
 &HT;    By Jim Bebbington
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO _ The accord reached Tuesday in Europe on a framework
for peace in Yugoslavia was greeted with skepticism by
ethnic-Albanian refugees who fled to Bosnia-Herzegovina from the
troubles in their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   More than 800,000 refugees have left the Yugoslavian provinces
of Sandzak and Kosovo, with more than 100,000 seeking refuge in
Bosnia, Yugoslavia's neighbor to the east.
</P>
<P>
   A delegation from Dayton arrives in today in the Bosnian capitol
of Sarajevo on a three-day goodwill mission to meet with Bosnian
officials and sign a Sister Cities agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Both in downtown Sarajevo and in a refugee camp about 20 miles
outside of the city, ethnic-Albanians said Tuesday they long to
return to their homes and villages, even if burned-out and
destroyed, if peace could be assured by international forces.
</P>
<P>
   After a flurry of optimism last weekend that the fighting would
soon end, ethnic-Albanians said they could not trust the promises
of Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic that he would keep his
side of a peace bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ``(I would return) only under guards,'' said Aziz Osmanaj, who
left the Kosovo village of Runik with his wife and three children.
``I know my house has been burned down. I know 80 percent of the
towns have been destroyed. I don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Osmanaj, an economist, said he first left his home a year ago as
intimidation increased from the Serbian-dominated Yugoslavian
government against non-Serbs in his territory. Road block
checkpoints sprang up throughout the region and police harassment
became common.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us came back into the village, but it was
impossible,'' he said. ``Most of us had to flee again.''
</P>
<P>
   Osmanaj left for good last winter, the week international
negotiators failed to convince the Yugoslavian government to allow
international peacekeepers into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew if the bombing started, we knew the killing would
start and we knew we would be the first to be hit,'' he said
through a United Nations interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Osmanaj is one of 250 refugees who arrived Saturday at a new
camp in the Bosnian village of Visoko run by the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugee. He spent a couple of months at
another camp that was set up when the refugees began arriving and
eventually became overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   Here, they sleep 70 to a room crammed with bunk beds in
temperatures that climb near 90 degrees during the day. There is
one spigot for fresh water, which residents use to drink, bathe and
wash clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Children pass the day kicking balls around an unkempt field near
their building, and adults listen to radios, talk and wait.
</P>
<P>
   Mehmet Gorcaj, 31, and his wife and three children stayed in
their Kosovo village of Istok through the winter even as the
political climate worsened. After the NATO offensive began in
March, however, Serb forces shelled his village and Gorcaj said he
was one of thousands from his region to flee along snow-packed
roads through the mountains to neighboring Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   They moved on to the Bosnian refugee camps when the Serbian
government in Montenegro began looking for young men to draft into
the Yugoslavian army.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since no one knew what would happen next, no one could stay,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gorcaj said he would be starting from ``under zero'' when his
family returns to their village.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. refugee officials have been caught off guard by the sudden
prospect for peace. In Sarajevo they have just opened another small
tent-city, even though the flow of refugees has slowed. Their
efforts are split between planning for having to house refugees
during the harsh Balkan winter six months off and planning to deal
with a feared rush of refugees flooding back into Kosovo once peace
is declared.
</P>
<P>
   Sarajevo has also become home to an estimated 22,500 refugees
from the Yugoslavian province of Sandzak. Many of them arrived on
buses and in rented cars over the past several months to stay with
family or rent apartments.
</P>
<P>
   One, a 68-year-old man who gave only his first name as Omar,
wandered slowly around the Sarajevo train depot and bus station
Monday with a grandson in tow. He left his home in March even
though he and Serbian neighbors were on good terms, he said. NATO
bombing was coming and he feared the bombing would create a
backlash against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feared that after bombing paramilitary units would come
into our village and our town and start killing and burn out,'' he
said through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   His said his family pays the equivalent of $700 a month for a
two-bedroom apartment and will stay for as long as their money will
last. The rate is high _ three times what a Bosnian family would be
charged.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic-Albanians in Sarajevo slept for weeks on the floor of the
train station's main hall when the NATO campaign first began and a
flood of people hit the city. Now the station remains a gathering
place for them, and they cluster around buses which still arrive
every day from Zenica, a city in Sandjak.
</P>
<P>
   One bus driver said Tuesday conditions in Sandjak are calm and
that his bus has not been stopped by troops. He said Sandjaks not
wanted for evading the draft could return today unmolested.

BIG 3 AUTOMAKERS AND UAW MAY SEEK NATIONAL CONTRACT OF 4 OR MORE
YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ With General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler
scheduled to begin talks next week with the United Automobile
Workers, it appears increasingly likely that negotiators will seek
a national labor contract lasting four or more years, the longest
such deal since the 1950s, auto executives and union officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Chastened by last summer's 54-day strike against GM in Flint,
Mich., and enjoying the soaring profits and bountiful overtime pay
produced by record auto sales, management and workers appear eager
to avoid another showdown this year. Serious differences could
still produce a strike, but industry and union leaders alike are
now using the tamest rhetoric in many years.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two decades of declining inflation rates have tempered
union fears that workers' pay would be ravaged by rising prices
during a long contract. For their part, the automakers would
welcome the ability to predict long-term costs. The current
contract expires Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   By departing from the traditional three-year contract, the UAW
would also be able to avoid having the next round of auto labor
talks in the summer of 2002, when the union could be locked in a
power struggle. Longtime UAW president Stephen Yokich must retire
when his current four-year term ends in June 2002 because he will
become 65 next year. The union's rules require that candidates for
the presidency, an elected position, be younger than 65, and Yokich
has no heir apparent.
</P>
<P>
   A longer contract would not assure labor peace in the auto
industry, however. Unlike most unions, the UAW won from the
automakers long ago the right to hold factory-level strikes for
health and safety reasons at any time, even while a contract is in
force. Last year's strike in Flint involved such a walkout.
</P>
<P>
   Key issues in talks to replace the current contract are certain
to include job security, particularly for workers at auto parts
subsidiaries that are being spun off, as well as modest changes to
the automakers' health care plans and other employee benefits,
executives and union officials said in interviews and public
appearances in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW has traditionally negotiated a contract with one auto
company first, and then demanded that the other two sign virtually
identical pacts. The company that negotiates the first pact has an
advantage, in that it can tailor an agreement to its own needs
while driving up its rivals' costs. Ford and GM seem to have a
better chance of being chosen by the union to negotiate the first
agreement than does DaimlerChrysler, but no decision has been made
yet, a person close to the union said.
</P>
<P>
   GM executives in particular have softened their criticisms of
the union and called for reconciliation, in the hope of avoiding
another strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working hard with all our unions to nurture a more open
relationship,'' said GM chairman and chief executive John Smith at
the company's annual meeting Monday in Wilmington, Del. ``We want
to build on common strengths, improve our cost competitiveness and
work through our differences without costly work stoppages.''
</P>
<P>
   But GM has in the past shown a peculiar knack for offending the
UAW, sometimes unintentionally. The automaker announced Tuesday,
six days before the contract negotiations formally open next
Monday, that it would spend $1.8 billion to buy a commercial
lending business from the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Although union leaders had no immediate reaction today, they
have criticized diversification moves by the automaker, calling on
the companies to invest more money in new equipment and factories
instead.
</P>
<P>
   All three automakers' current, three-year national contracts
with the UAW expire at midnight on Sept. 14. Since the Eisenhower
administration, national auto labor contracts have lasted for three
years, and the triennial negotiations have been closely followed as
a barometer of wage pressures in the U.S. economy. While the
automakers are no longer the nation's largest private employers _
Wal-Mart overtook GM two years ago _ the wages and benefits set in
their contracts still strongly influence the rest of the
manufacturing sector, which accounts for about a fifth of the
nation's economic output.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation and obscure accounting rules discouraged the union and
the companies alike from pursuing longer agreements. Inflation
caused by the Korean War ravaged the earnings power of auto workers
during a five-year pact in the 1950s and prompted union leaders
then to vow that future deals would not exceed three years, a
decision followed until now.
</P>
<P>
   Recent contracts have only partly protected workers against
inflation, guaranteeing that, in addition to wage increases,
workers will receive an extra 1 percent raise for every 2.6
percentage points of inflation. But the decline in the inflation
rate has reduced union worries on this score.
</P>
<P>
   Accounting rules also require the companies to charge certain
pension concessions against their profits in the first year of an
agreement, and the cost of these concessions rises with longer
agreements. But with all three automakers posting record or
near-record profits, they are in unusually strong financial
condition to take such a charge.
</P>
<P>
   Yokich mentioned the possibility of a longer contract at a news
conference in May. ``With all the money they've got, they might be
able to put enough money on that table that we have to take a
4-year or 5-year or 6-year or 10-year'' contract, he said, speaking
of the automakers.
</P>
<P>
   While auto executives dismiss the idea of a 10-year contract,
which would limit their options through at least two generations of
new cars, they have been receptive to the possibility of a four- to
six-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW has been quarreling with DaimlerChrysler over how much
help the automaker should give the union in organizing a Mercedes
factory in Alabama and a DaimlerChrysler heavy truck factory in
North Carolina. With union leaders also nervous about a showdown
with German executives they barely know, the union is expected to
negotiate the first contract with GM or, perhaps more likely, Ford.
</P>
<P>
   If Ford goes first, it would probably try to work out the terms
of an eventual spinoff of Visteon Automotive Systems, its auto
parts unit. Such a settlement could have major implications for GM
In previous spinoffs of smaller subsidiaries by Ford and GM
contracts guaranteed that workers in the subsidiary could retire
within the next few years with full pensions and health benefits
from the automaker, not the subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   In May, GM spun off its 200,000-employee auto parts unit, Delphi
Automotive Systems. A big question now is whether Ford will agree
to accept huge numbers of workers back from Visteon if it is ever
spun off. While Ford could use those workers in its expanding sport
utility vehicle factories, GM has too many workers already and does
not need more from Delphi. But if Ford signs a pattern-setting
contract first, the UAW may force GM to accept the same terms or
face another costly strike. &QL;

 &HT;    PEACE APPEARS CLOSE AS MILITARY COMMANDERS MEET ON SERB PULLOUT
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-RETURN-0609.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT

<P>
   KUMANOVO, Macedonia _ Senior NATO and Yugoslav commanders
resumed talks late Tuesday on a Serb pullout from Kosovo, hours
after diplomats in Germany agreed to the language of a United
Nations Security Council resolution mapping out the road to peace.
</P>
<P>
   British Lt. Gen. Mike Jackson led the NATO delegation into a
large camouflaged tent at a NATO base on this border outpost, where
they continued to meet with senior Yugoslav commanders into the
early morning (local time). Negotiations on that subject had broken
down over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   As momentum for peace mounted, NATO was preparing to pause its
11-week bombing campaign as soon as Serb forces begin to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Cook, the British foreign secretary, said in Cologne,
Germany that could happen ``in the next few days,'' depending on
the outcome of the military talks.
</P>
<P>
   Some 17,000 NATO troops were poised to pour into Kosovo on short
notice as the lead elements to a larger peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Serb vehicles had begun to
assemble, apparently in preparation for a pullout.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of indications that the Serbs plan to
withdraw,'' Bacon told Pentagon reporters, citing ``signs that they
are mobilizing vehicles and other means to transport people out.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton cautiously hailed the developments, but
insisted that NATO air strikes would continue until the alliance
could verify through aerial observation that Serb forces were
beginning to withdraw along one or more of three specific routes
leading out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there is evidence that full withdrawal has begun, we will
suspend the bombing and then monitor that for compliance,'' Clinton
told reporters at the White House. ``We have to know that they're
withdrawing.''
</P>
<P>
   The flurry of activity Tuesday was triggered by agreement over
the language on a U.N. Security Council resolution reached among
the United States, Russia and six other major powers _ Britain,
Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan _ earlier Tuesday in
Cologne.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council reviewed the draft resolution and was
expected to approve it as early as Wednesday, depending on how
quickly NATO bombing ends.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Tuesday's agreement
cleared the way for rapid progress on the military-to-military
talks aimed at nailing down the details under which Serb leader
Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Yugoslavia, would begin
pulling out troops from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless he is totally tone deaf, he should be getting the
message that it is time to withdraw,'' Albright told reporters at a
press conference in Cologne. ``The regime in Belgrade should stop
shilly-shallying around.''
</P>
<P>
   Two permanent members of the Security Council _ China and Russia
_ said they were unwilling to approve the resolution, however,
until NATO halts the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Security Council is not a rubber stamp,'' Beijing's deputy
permanent U.N. representative, Shen Guofang, told reporters in New
York. Before taking up the resolution, Shen said, ``We should have
confirmation from NATO and the Yugoslav side that arrangements have
been made and the bombing stops.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution is meant to build on and codify a peace agreement
accepted last Thursday by Milosevic after it was presented to him
in Belgrade by the European Union's envoy to the Balkans, Finnish
President Martti Ahtisaari and by Russia's Balkans envoy Victor
Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution approved Tuesday by the top diplomats from the
so-called Group of Eight includes the Ahtisaari-Chernomyrdin accord
as an annex.
</P>
<P>
   That enabled the United States and Russia to agree to language
that doesn't specify that the peacekeeping force would be led by
NATO _ language Moscow opposed. The annex, however, specifies that
the security force would have ``essential NATO participation'' and
would operate under ``unified control and command.''
</P>
<P>
   That means the peacekeeping force will be a NATO operation, said
Albright.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got what we came for'' she said. ``We have made very clear
that this has a NATO core and that NATO will be the military
leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Albright, ``Obviously, there will be a NATO commander . . .
whatever other forces come in will then be integrated with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Her Russian counterpart, foreign minister Igor Ivanov, said
Moscow was not fully on board with the composition of the force or
the circumstances under which Russian troops might be a part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any agreement is a compromise,'' said Ivanov. ``The resolution
settles the principles, the foundations. And we have now to work
out the format and the mandate, which are tied to this
international presence for security.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright dispatched her deputy, Strobe Talbott, to Moscow for
immediate talks aimed at resolving that.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said, though, that Russian troops, should they
participate in the peacekeeping force, would not be commanded by
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect that to happen,'' said Clinton, shortly after a
15-minute telephone call to Russian President Boris Yeltsin on
Tuesday, the second in two days. ``But I do expect that there will
be an acceptable level of coordination, the way we worked it out in
Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia has several hundred troops participating in the NATO
peacekeeping operation in Bosnia, which borders Kosovo. Formally,
the Russian troops don't report up the NATO chain of command.
Instead, the Russians operate in a sector controlled by U.S.
forces, and the Russians and Americans work in close cooperation
there.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the movement toward peace, NATO pressed its air strikes
into the early hours of Wednesday after sharply ratcheting up
attacks Monday night and early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and allied pilots flew 166 strike sorties and 410 support
flights during the 24 hours ending early Tuesday, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   In at least two instances this week, Bacon said, B-52
Stratofortresses bombed fielded forces in the area of Mount
Pastrik. The area, near the Albanian border, has been the scene of
fierce fighting in recent days between Serb-led Yugoslav forces and
members of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports that the attacks killed or wounded hundreds
of Serb troops. Bacon said he could not confirm casualty figures,
but he said the attacks were believed to have been devastating.
</P>
<P>
   He said that NATO was prepared to pause the air campaign
promptly, once the alliance verifies through aerial observation
that Serb forces have begun pulling out.
</P>
<P>
   After that happens, Bacon said, the North Atlantic Council,
NATO's political arm, would review the details of the withdrawal
and vote on whether to direct Secretary-General Javier Solana to
order a pause in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, Solana would order that the Kosovo peacekeeping
force, or KFOR, begin moving into the war-ravaged province from
neighboring Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday, there were roughly 17,000 NATO forces _ chiefly
British and French _ in Macedonia, prepared to move out on short
notice.
</P>
<P>
   Those forces would make up the vanguard of what would eventually
be a 48,000 troop force, 7,000 of which would be Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The first U.S. forces to enter Kosovo would be 1,900 Marines
from the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which was afloat in the
Aegean Sea Tuesday, and 1,700 Army troops currently in Albania,
Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   The Army forces would include light infantry from the 82nd
Airborne Division, a half-dozen Apache attack helicopters, and a
contingent of light armored vehicles and tanks from the 1st Armored
Division.
</P>
<P>
   Those forces would travel by land and air from Albania to
Macedonia before marrying up with the Marines to deploy to Kosovo,
Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines are standing by to unload in Greece and travel by
land to Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   (Deans reported from Washington; Albright reported from
Kumanovo, Macedonia).

   Those forces would make up the vanguard of what would eventually
be a 48,000 troop force, 7,000 of which would be Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The first U.S. forces to enter Kosovo would be 1,900 Marines

   Those forces would travel by land and air from Albania to

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One of the problems for the airliner that skidded
off the runway and crashed last week at the airport in Little Rock,
Ark., appears to be a string of bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   The government provides money for three safety measures designed
to eliminate or reduce the risk of such accidents. But none of
those steps had been taken in Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,000-foot buffer zone now required at the end of runways is
not in place in Little Rock because construction of the runway
began before the rule took effect. The airport does not have
breakaway light poles, common at the edges of airports, because the
flood-prone ground is too soft. And it does not yet have a safety
trap, called an arrestor bed, although one was approved before the
June 1 accident.
</P>
<P>
   Nine people, including the captain, were killed in the crash,
and 80 were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The runway that was used by the plane, American Airlines Flight
1420, lacked the 1,000-foot buffer zone required on new runways
since Jan. 1, 1988, even though it opened in 1991. But because work
on the runway began in the early 1980s, the airport did not have to
comply with that rule, Federal Aviation Administration officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The overrun area for the runway, 4 Right, was 450 feet. The jet
went through that area, smashed into stanchions holding lights that
direct planes approaching from the opposite direction, and broke up
and caught fire.
</P>
<P>
   The parallel runway has such a 1,000-foot area, recently
expanded from 766 feet, when it was rehabilitated. But 4 Right, old
enough to be grandfathered, is too young to be rehabilitated and
thus still is not subject to the rule, which requires 1,000 feet
wherever practical. Exactly how far the zone could have been
extended on 4 Right is uncertain, because the Arkansas River's
flood plain is off the northeast end.
</P>
<P>
   But for the very spot where the crash occurred, the airport has
already been promised money from the FAA for an arrestor bed,
designed to catch and safely stop airplanes doing just what
American's MD-80 did, overrun the end of the runway. The project is
supposed to be built next year, at a cost of $1 million to $1.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   At the National Transportation Safety Board, which is in charge
of the investigation, officials are still trying to determine why
devices on the wings that help cut lift after landing, called
spoilers, did not deploy. On the MD-80, standard procedure is to
``arm'' the spoilers by setting a control in the cockpit before
landing, allowing the spoilers to pop up when the plane's wheels
start spinning. Reducing lift gives the wheels more traction as the
plane's weight settles on them.
</P>
<P>
   The first officer, who survived the crash, told investigators
that he saw the captain arm the spoilers, but the flight data
recorder indicates they were never deployed. Experts say that
investigators may be able to hear the sound of the spoilers being
armed on the cockpit voice recorder.
</P>
<P>
   George Black Jr., the member of the board in charge at the
scene, said there was no mention of the spoilers on the tape. But
investigators say that this does not establish that they were not
armed.
</P>
<P>
   The runway that the plane used is 7,200 feet long, on the short
side for an MD-80, which is known to pilots as a heavy plane with
relatively low aerodynamic drag, and thus harder to stop. Airport
engineers had to fit it into a space 8,650 feet long, because the
flood plain of the Arkansas River is at the northeast end. They did
take 1,000 feet for a buffer zone, but they put it at the other end
of the runway, so it is a buffer for planes coming in the other
direction, in which case the runway is called 22 Left. (Runways are
named by compass heading.)
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear why the plane used the runway, 4
Right, instead of 4 Left, which is 1,000 feet longer. Both were
available that night, according to an airport spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, lighting stanchions like the ones that Flight 1420
hit are supposed to be designed to break away on impact, so they do
not break up the airplane, as happened in this case. But the
stanchions that this plane hit sit in the flood plain of the
Arkansas River, and their bases had to be made sturdier to avoid
having them tilt or fall, according to FAA officials.
</P>
<P>
   Arrestor systems, first put in use at Kennedy and La Guardia
airports in New York, are rare. One at Kennedy got its first
operational use last month, saving a commuter plane from taxiing
into the water at the end of a runway. Asked if they were often
considered by airport managers, David Bennett, the director of the
FAA's office of airport safety and standards, said, ``If it wasn't
before, it probably is now.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Officials in Little Rock reopened the runway Tuesday, although
for planes landing in the opposite direction, it is available for
visual approaches only, since the MD-80 destroyed some navigation
equipment at the far end.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators, meanwhile, continued to examine the wreckage of
the plane, some of which was inaccessible until it was moved off
the field. Matthew Furhman, a spokesman for the National
Transportation Safety Board, said that part of the landing gear,
for example, was only now available for study.

CLINTON, THEATER GROUP ANNOUNCE ADMITTANCE CRACKDOWN TO R-RATED
MOVIES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Most movie theater owners agreed Tuesday to require
an ID check of youths seeking admission into R-rated movies to halt
underage youngsters from sneaking into restricted films.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the National Association of Theater Owners appeared
with President Clinton in the White House's Roosevelt Room to
announce the new crackdown as the president's campaign against
youth violence gained support from one segment of the entertainment
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about the multiplex is that there's a movie
for every member of the family, but not every movie is for every
member of the family,'' Clinton said. ``When you drop them off, you
shouldn't have to worry about your G-rated kids getting into
violent or suggestive R-rated movies. Too often, children do get
past the ticket counter unescorted and underage.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie rating system was developed in 1968 by the Motion
Picture Association of America. The ratings have been refined over
the years to G for general admission, PG for parental guidance
suggested, PG-13 for parents cautioned material may be
inappropriate for children under age 13, R for restricted to age 17
and over unless accompanied by a parent or guardian and NC-17 for
no one under 17 admitted.
</P>
<P>
   The renewed commitment to enforce the R-rating came in wake of
the series of school shootings, including the murder of 12 students
and a teacher by two Columbine High School teens in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us, I believe, have had our sensibilities heightened
since the recent tragedies at Columbine and in Georgia, and we as
theater owners feel our responsibilities as keenly as does
anybody,'' said William Kartozian, president of the National
Association of Theater Owners.
</P>
<P>
   Kartozian said the association will ask its 700 members, who
control 65 percent of the screens nationwide, to post notices of
the crackdown, educating parents about the ratings and the new
policy, and support for a national study on the causes of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in the community that we serve, and we want to be a
part of those communities and be a part of the solution to whatever
problems may be going on in your communities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hailed the action by the theater owners to adopt a new
policy requiring a photo identification of unaccompanied youths
seeking admission into R-rated films. Every state but Massachusetts
allows either a driver's license or a photo identification for 17
year olds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased to announce today the theater owners are clearly
drawing the line,'' Clinton said. ``From now on, parents will know
that the R rating means what it is supposed to mean _ restricted _
no one under 17 without a parent or guardian, and no exceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by the theater owners is the latest in a series
of White House efforts launched since the Columbine shootings. The
president previously hosted a conference at the White House on ways
to reduce youth violence, ordered a study to determine if the
entertainment industry is marketing violence to youngsters and
embraced gun-control efforts pending in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also pressed the House to follow the Senate's lead to
increase the age restriction for purchasing guns, require
background checks at gun shows, require safety locks to be sold
with every handgun and ban importation of large ammunition clips.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our growing national campaign to prevent youth violence,
none can stand aside, none should stand in the way,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But that campaign has been greeted cautiously by the movie and
music industry, where fears of censorship are paramount. Clinton,
who has drawn policy support from Hollywood, predicted more
industry officials will join the effort to tame the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a significant number of people in the
entertainment industry who will participate in it, because a lot of
them said something to me about it,'' Clinton told reporters as he
met with Hungarian President Arpad Goncz.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we all work at it ... so that nobody's pointing a finger at
anybody else, I think we'll have a good participation from the
entertainment community. I'd be surprised if we don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made his call for a crackdown on R-rating age
restrictions during a May 15 radio address in which he also noted
the typical teen-ager will see 40,000 simulated murders by age 18.
During the radio address, he also called for a halt to showing guns
in previews watched by children and for a re-evaluation of the
entire ratings system.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ I know exactly how the Republicans feel.
</P>
<P>
   They've ensorcelled themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They really, really want this relationship to work out. After
eight lonely years they've eagerly invented the image of their
desires, imbuing him with magical qualities. Their fantasy guy will
sweep in and transform their humdrum little lives. They're
banishing all doubts, ruling out all rivals, ignoring any
disturbing intrusions of reality.
</P>
<P>
   They are counting the moments until the Big Crush replaces the
Big Creep.
</P>
<P>
   You can picture Trent Lott and Dick Armey and Tom DeLay acting
like giggling schoolgirls, drawing hearts in their ``G.W.B.''
scrapbooks while they watch ``Dawson's Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   Yup, the Republicans are bewitched. And that means soon they'll
be bothered. And then bewildered.
</P>
<P>
   Dreamboats always sink.
</P>
<P>
   W. goes on his blind date with history this weekend, chaperoned
by a couple of hundred ravenous reporters, making his maiden
campaign swing to Iowa and New Hampshire. There is a stopover in
Kennebunkport, a town that, like his name, evokes the presidency.
Just in case anyone missed the connection, Junior will be stopping
by to celebrate Poppy's 75th on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans should remain besotted as long as their crush can
pass a few simple tests:
</P>
<P>
   1. He'll be more deft on a rope line than Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   2. He will keep everyone from realizing that ``compassionate
conservatism'' is a fallacy, that you can't be generous and mingy
at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   3. He will be so attractive to women that soccer moms won't even
listen to Al Gore babbling about how he'll fix traffic jams and
suburban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   4. His position on abortion will be so nuanced, so finely tuned,
so beautifully befuddling that the Christian Coalition will think
he's fervently anti-abortion and NOW will understand that he's
secretly pro-choice.
</P>
<P>
   5. When reporters ask why he wasn't in Vietnam, he'll have a
much better excuse than Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   6. The fact that W. has been studying foreign affairs so
diligently, and the fact that he now knows not to call the Kosovars
``Kosovians'' or the Greeks ``Grecians,'' will be seen as signs of
growth and maturity, not as the beginning of some horrible Quayle
gaffe trajectory.
</P>
<P>
   7. If a nude picture of W. dancing on a bar does show up, it
will be flattering and have good lighting.
</P>
<P>
   8. His platform will be so appealing that voters won't notice
that the Republicans can't pass a simple spending bill and don't
even have the pretense of an agenda.
</P>
<P>
   9. His position on gun control will be so nuanced, so finely
tuned, so beautifully befuddling that Rosie O'Donnell and Charlton
Heston will both rush to endorse it.
</P>
<P>
   10. Boomers will find him groovy, even though he once confessed
that in the '60s he did not like the Beatles when they went through
their ``weird psychedelic period.''
</P>
<P>
   11. His vision will be as compelling as Ronald Reagan's and his
manners as elegant as his father's.
</P>
<P>
   12. His position on Social Security will be so nuanced, so
finely tuned, so beautifully befuddling that it will be hailed by
the AARP, Wall Street and MTV.
</P>
<P>
   13. He will never lose that famous temper.
</P>
<P>
   14. Reporters will gush over him more than John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   15. His pledge-torturing, beer-guzzling frat-boy past will seem
endlessly amusing, like the raffish Otter in ``Animal House.''
</P>
<P>
   16. Even if he did do something illegal, his escapades will seem
classier than Bill Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   17. His position on campaign finance reform will be so nuanced,
so finely tuned, so beautifully befuddling that it will get
Republicans off the hook with Common Cause without stopping the
GOP's soft-money pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   18. People will buy that story about his being a self-made
businessman.
</P>
<P>
   19. His part-ownership of the Texas Rangers will make him seem
even more of a jock than Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   20. He'll be so wildly popular with blacks and Hispanics that
the Republicans will lose their image as the Simon Legree party.
</P>
<P>
   21. He'll be tough on China without making them give back the
secrets they stole during the Bush and Clinton administrations.
</P>
<P>
   22. He will be seen as a true Texan. He won't need pork rinds.
</P>

MARKET PLACE: END OF AN ILLUSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even as the markets have soared in the last few
years, most sophisticated investors have enough wits to beware of
anyone who promises to double their money within two weeks in
risk-free investments in a secretive global trading market backed
by the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   But the illusion of such returns can become alluring when the
person making the claims has pictures on his office wall of himself
with presidents and other luminaries, and a pedigree to match.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the illusion came crashing down on Lewis Rivlin, a
prominent Washington lawyer, when the Securities and Exchange
Commission accused him in a lawsuit of defrauding investors of $6.2
million.
</P>
<P>
   According to government lawyers and court papers, Rivlin traded
on his prominence by promising investors that they would lose
nothing if they invested in a high-yield trading program that he
said would be conducted under the auspices of Chrysanthos
Chrysostomou, who had been the metropolitan of Limassol, a bishop
in the Greek Orthodox Church in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   Rivlin now says that all of the money has been stolen by
foreigners, and the investors, which include an Ecuadorean charity
for underprivileged girls, have been left with nothing.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Richard Walker, head of the SEC's enforcement
division, it turns out that the market _ as well as the securities
that Rivlin promoted with a former law partner and former aide _
was entirely fictitious.
</P>
<P>
   Rivlin said in an interview Tuesday night that he did nothing
improper and that he would prevail. ``I can take the government's
pants down, there's no question about that,'' he said. ``I didn't
waste years of training at the Justice Department and then in
private practice and go lightly into something that the government
said is all fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   On paper, at least, Rivlin's career would seem to be incongruous
with Tuesday's complaint.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Swarthmore College and Harvard Law School, Rivlin
began his legal career in the civil division of the Justice
Department and rose to become a senior trial lawyer in the
antitrust division.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, he co-founded a law firm whose other members included
former Sen. Albert Gore Sr. of Tennessee, the father of Vice
President Al Gore; former Gov. Endicott Peabody of Massachusetts,
and Charles Duncan, the former dean of Howard Law School. Rivlin
was also a campaign coordinator for Hubert Humphrey's unsuccessful
presidential campaign in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Rivlin's marriage to Alice Rivlin, the vice chairwoman of the
Federal Reserve, ended in divorce more than 20 years ago. The
couple have three children, and she recently said she would retire
from the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's complaint is the latest in a string of setbacks for
Rivlin, who is 69. Two months ago, a federal judge awarded $16
million to the Ecuadorean charity, which sued Rivlin after it
invested more than $1.7 million with him. Representing himself in
that case, Rivlin said he could not produce many details about the
investments because they were secret, according to another lawyer
involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sharp, a lawyer representing the charity, said that Rivlin
contended in his deposition in the civil case that the investment
was legitimate and that because it was secret, he could not talk
about it.
</P>
<P>
   Royce Lamberth, the judge hearing that case, has been assigned
to preside over the SEC's action and has ordered that Rivlin's
passport be seized.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate proceeding, an ethics panel is weighing sanctions
against Rivlin for allegations that he committed fraud and
commingled $48,000 of a client's money with his own. Rivlin
supposedly asked the client to invest in the purchase and resale of
diamonds and gold from the Central African Republic.
</P>
<P>
   In that proceeding, Rivlin has denied any wrongdoing, though the
Office of Bar Counsel in Washington has accused him of using a
client's money to pay himself; his wife; a local supermarket; Radio
Shack; Sears, Roebuck, and Publishers Clearing House.
</P>
<P>
   According to the complaint filed Tuesday by the SEC, the
investment agreements Rivlin promoted said that all money invested
would be ``secured'' either by a bank guarantee or some other
security. Some investors were also told by Rivlin that he would
personally guarantee them against any loss.
</P>
<P>
   Each agreement said that either Rivlin or Chrysostomou had a
relationship with at least one person who would conduct or control
trading in the secret program, specifically the purchase and resale
of deeply discounted bank instruments, the SEC said. The agreements
also said trading would begin soon after the transfer of the
investor's money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trading, in fact, never began,'' the agency said in its court
papers.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint also named as defendants Alfred Velarde, Rivlin's
former law partner, and Edwin Huling III, a former employee of the
firm. Velarde has settled with the government and agreed to pay a
$20,000 penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The bishop, who resigned in November, was suspended from
religious duties for two years after the church accused him of
profiteering. The SEC named him as a recipient of ill-gotten gains.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers at the SEC said the case was not a novel one but
provided an important lesson for investors. ``People need to focus
on the quality of the investments they make, not the connections of
the broker they deal with,'' said Elizabeth Gray, an assistant
director of enforcement. ``In this case, it turns out that they
were both corrupt.''

ONCE AGAIN, A FATHER IS EJECTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By SAMANTHA STEVENSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, England _ The father of Jelena Dokic, a promising
16-year-old Australian, was ejected during her tennis match at a
tournament here Tuesday and later picked up by the police after
lying in the middle of a road.
</P>
<P>
   According to the police, the father, Damir Dokic, was cautioned
for drunken and disorderly behavior and was released without being
charged.
</P>
<P>
   During his daughter's match at the DFS Classic, Dokic began
shouting at spectators and officials during a first-round match
against Rita Grande of Italy. Brenda Perry, a WTA Tour director,
asked Dokic to leave the area, having already cautioned him during
Dokic's qualifying match earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Security guards said Damir Dokic pushed Perry and refused to
leave. Six guards then lifted Dokic, struggling, past spectators to
the exit at the rear of the grounds, at the Edgbaston Priory Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``He began running down the street and shouting,'' said Marcus
Allchurch, a tournament security guard. Dokic then jumped on the
hood of a car and rolled off, the guard said, zigzagged down the
street and threw himself in the middle of the road in front of
another car.
</P>
<P>
   Allchurch said the automobile, driven by a woman with a child in
a car seat, stopped, avoiding running him over.
</P>
<P>
   ``He flipped his lid,'' said Lester Smedley, a security guard
coordinator.

   Dokic was held by security guards for more than an hour until
the police arrived and arrested him. Several times he fell on his
knees in prayer and at one point tried to cut his arm with his
glasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've not seen anything like this before,'' said Roy Dixon, a
club member. ``I know of the Mary Pierce incident and others that
have happened in tennis. I've played 45 years of tennis and nine
years at Wimbledon, and no, I have not seen anything like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The women's tour has been concerned with the parents of the
young players, worried about not only their behavior in the stands
but toward their children. Pierce's father, Jim, was banned from
the women's tour from 1993 to 1998 after two incidents at the
French Open, one in which he punched a fan. His daughter, then 18,
later accused him of abusive behavior. Last year, Mirjana Lucic,
then 16, left her father, Marinko, saying that he had physically
abused her. In both cases, the fathers denied the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Bart McGuire, the chief executive officer of the WTA Tour, said
that Damir Dokic would be barred for the rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
   The match between Dokic and Grande was suspended by wet grass in
the third set. She asked to be to be driven to the police station
to see her father.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Handford, the custody sergeant of the Harborne Police
Station, said: `` Dokic was cautioned for drunk and disorderly
conduct. He was more sober than he had been and so he was released.
We've seen worse offenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Jelena Dokic was born in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, and took up
tennis at the age of 6 before her family moved to Australia when
she was 10. Known for her mental tenacity, Dokic has been compared
to a youthful Monica Seles. WTA Tour officials said her father had
been cited previously for yelling at a security guard in an
incident in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Dokic and Mark Philippoussis led Australia to its
first Hopman Cup title. She won the U.S. Open junior title last
year and at the 1998 French Open she was a finalist in the junior
singles and won the junior doubles. She finished the year as the
world's top-ranked junior and is ranked 133rd on the tour.

REPUBLICANS ROUTE GUN MEASURES STRAIGHT TO THE FLOOR
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ill., Mo., Fla., N.Y.)  (jw) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republican leaders said Tuesday that they
would bring gun-control legislation to the House floor next week
without holding a previously scheduled meeting in the House
Judiciary Committee, a change in strategy that demonstrated their
acute sensitivity to the potency of gun control as a political
issue.
</P>
<P>
   The move would deny Democrats an additional showcase, in advance
of the debate on the House floor, to paint Republicans as outright
foes of real change or reluctant, half-hearted converts to the
cause.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Republican aides said party leaders did not want the
passage of gun-control measures, which they now see as a political
necessity, to get tripped up by the opposition of Republicans on
the Judiciary Committee, who tend to be more conservative as a
group than other House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, House Republicans' gun-control proposals, which were
unveiled Tuesday, bear the imprimatur not of the entire Judiciary
Committee, but of its chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., or of Hyde
and the chairman of the committee's crime subcommittee, Rep. Bill
McCollum, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, those measures largely mirror the gun-control
provisions passed by the Senate, but there were some changes in
language and one particularly significant divergence that is sure
to provoke intense dispute between Republicans and Democrats in the
days to come.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal by Hyde and McCollum for mandatory background
checks on all buyers at gun shows contains a more liberal
definition of those shows, and less stringent requirements on
record-keeping, than the Senate measure did.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Hyde and McCollum proposed that any gathering of
fewer than 10 vendors, no matter how many guns they exhibit, was
not a gun show. Under the Senate measure, it could be regulated as
a gun show, if there were 50 or more guns for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats instantly cried foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're clearly watering down the Senate provisions, and it's
an outrage,'' said Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., an ardent advocate of
gun control.
</P>
<P>
   But in a number of other ways, Hyde's proposals dovetailed with
the desires of Democrats or fell short of their worst fears.
</P>
<P>
   The gun-show measure did not put a 24-hour limit on the time
that vendors would have to conduct background checks, as many
Republicans and officials with the National Rifle Association had
advocated.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it set a cap of three calendar days, a time frame only
slightly more liberal than the three business days allowed by the
Senate legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the collection of measures proposed by Hyde and
McCollum proposed raising the minimum legal age for all handgun
purchases from 18 to 21, something that the Senate did not tackle.
The measures also went beyond the Senate's by calling for parents
to be held legally culpable when their guns end up in the hands of
children and do harm.
</P>
<P>
   Because the House Judiciary Committee meeting was canceled, the
gun-control proposals will not actually be rolled into the juvenile
crime that will serve as the vehicle for the measures on the House
floor. Rather, the measures _ some of them lumped together, some of
them standing alone _ will be offered as amendments, and will
likely be supplemented by a few additional or rival Democratic
amendments that Republican leaders allow to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The cancellation of the committee meeting opened the door to
complaints by Democrats that Republicans were trying to give the
gun-control debate a lower profile and evade accountability with
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said it was the latest
sign of Republicans' coziness with the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me suspicious that they're in control and they're
driving the ship so they can get the results they want,'' Gephardt
said of the gun lobbying organization.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde called the Democrats' criticisms a ``knee-jerk, mindless
reaction. I, the chairman, do not want to kill the gun bill. I am
not part of any strategy to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, by eliminating the scheduled meeting of Hyde's panel,
Republican leaders may have removed a few potential obstacles to
the passage of gun control.
</P>
<P>
   One is a proposal by Hyde that would prohibit the distribution
to children and teen-agers of any violent books, videogames and
other materials. That measure, rife with potential violations of
the First Amendment and odious to many Democrats and Republicans,
might have been added into a Republican gun-control package during
the Judiciary Committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it will apparently come to the House floor as its own
amendment, which Republican aides said was likely to be defeated.
``It's legally ridiculous,'' said one Republican aide.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But it was an example of the many possible pitfalls for the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the Hyde-McCollum gun-control measures are combined
with some strict new requirements on punishing juvenile offenders
that many Democrats will not want to vote for. Additionally, some
Democrats who do not usually vote for gun control do not want to
brave those waters now unless the juvenile crime bill is amended to
include more money and programs for the prevention of violence
among children.
</P>
<P>
   The two gun-control measures that McCollum did not choose to
sponsor with Hyde concerned the minimum age for handgun purchases
and a ban on the import of high-capacity ammunition clips, the
latter of which the Senate approved.
</P>
<P>
   That Hyde put these proposals forward by himself was an
indication that they enjoyed more narrow support among Republicans
and were less likely to pass than other measures, like a
requirement that child safety devices accompany all handguns sold
by federally licensed dealers.

SPEAKER TRIES TO UNIFY REPUBLICANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He was supposed to be the un-Newt.
</P>
<P>
   Installed as House speaker last fall during one of the most
chaotic chapters in Republican Party history, Representative Dennis
Hastert of Illinois was hailed as everything his predecessor was
not: quiet, collaborative, unifying, firm.
</P>
<P>
   During the past six months, Hastert has proven to be all of
those things, colleagues say. And yet the Republican-controlled
Congress is still plagued by the same legislative logjams that
helped destroy Newt Gingrich as speaker _ so much so that many
members have begun questioning Hastert's leadership style, too.
</P>
<P>
   The appropriations process has stalled. Gun-control legislation
is up in the air. A key vote on Kosovo in April ended in a baffling
tie vote, drawing accusations that Hastert had no political muscle
and that House Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas is really running
the place.
</P>
<P>
   As if to respond to those charges, Hastert on Tuesday summoned
his party together to deliver one of the most forceful speeches of
his term, quoting Benjamin Franklin as he pleaded with House
Republicans to get a budget passed, many of those present said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do either hang together or hang separately,'' Hastert told
members, who burst into applause.
</P>
<P>
   But whether that message will become reality remained a question
in the minds of many Democrats as well as, privately, some
Republicans. The problem, they said, may have less to do with
Hastert than the fractured party he is forced to lead with a narrow
six-vote margin in the House.
</P>
<P>
   His usually tempered tone has brought him respect from most
factions of the Republican Party, even from Representative
Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican who is at odds with the
speaker over when to bring the campaign-finance overhaul bill to
the House floor. Unlike during the Gingrich days, Shays said, ``I
don't wake up every morning wondering what my speaker said that I'm
going to have to defend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I sleep better at night,'' Shays said. ``I may disagree with
Denny, but that's different from saying I don't think he's an
effective leader.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gingrich, who was forced by his own party to step down,
thinks Hastert is ``proving to be an effective legislative
leader,'' according to Michael Shields, communications director for
the Friends of Newt Gingrich Political Action Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Such praise, however, depends on which measuring stick for
effectiveness is used _ whether it is gauged by popularity ratings
or election results or pieces of legislation passed. Democrats
argue that the budget resolution passed earlier this year cannot be
counted as a Hastert success if it collapses during the
appropriations process. Three spending measures were expected to
pass before the Memorial Day holiday, but have become bottlenecked
primarily because of resistance from conservatives who say the
bills cost too much.
</P>
<P>
   On gun control, Hastert has voiced support for measures similar
to the ones recently passed by the Senate. But House leaders pushed
back consideration of the legislation until next week as
Republicans wrangle over various amendments that gun control
supporters say would water down the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Hastert presented a plan designed to rescue the
appropriations process, starting with adhering to budget caps and
shaving money off a $60.8 billion agriculture bill that
conservatives had promised to kill. Conservatives indicated Tuesday
they would go along with the plan, which would shift some spendin
to bolster domestic programs that would be cut under the current
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the unusually stern tone of Tuesday's speech that
indicated a shift for Hastert. He made it clear that any six
Republicans could defeat a bill, and that any major political
embarrassments for the party could make it easy for Democrats to
win control of the House next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends, you cannot be happy all the time,'' Hastert said.
``Some days you have to give your leadership the benefit of the
doubt and just follow. That is the difference between a majority
mentality and a minority mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I need you to stand together,'' he continued. ``To move
forward together. To not just cry out for leadership, but be
willing to follow it.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately afterward, Democrats questioned whether Hastert
could provide such leadership. Representative Steny H. Hoyer, a
Democrat from Maryland, said Congress ``will have to see if there's
really a shift'' within the Republican leadership team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew they needed a kinder, gentler face on the caucus,
but what we've seen in the last month is that they still have a
hard heart,'' he said. ``I don't think the problem has been so much
with the speaker. It's been the Republicans. The enemy is within.''

MOSCOW ENVOY'S PEACE EFFORTS, PRAISED IN WEST, ARE PANNED AT HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KOSOVO-RDP, KOSOVO-DIPLOMACY-ASSESS) 
 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ When Russia's special envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin, went
to Belgrade last week with the president of Finland to help resolve
the Kosovo conflict, he was seen in the West as a heroic statesman.
</P>
<P>
   But no sooner did Chernomyrdin return to Moscow than he ran into
a buzz saw of criticism. Communist lawmakers demanded that he be
censured for working too closely with NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military also did its best to undermine his
diplomacy. Lt. Gen. Yevgeny Barmyantsev, the Russian military
attache in Belgrade who was sent to military talks in Macedonia as
an observer, went so far as to encourage the Serbs to rebuff NATO's
demands, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Even President Boris Yeltsin's dutiful foreign minister, Igor
Ivanov, mounted a quiet effort in Cologne over the past two days to
dilute the agreement that Chernomyrdin and the Finnish president,
Martti Ahtisaari, brought back from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Ivanov urged that a one-year limit be set on
NATO's peacekeeping presence in Kosovo. He finally agreed to an
open-ended deployment.
</P>
<P>
   In the end it was Yeltsin's desire to see the war brought to an
end that seems to have prevailed. Following days of confusion and
considerable intrigue, the Kremlin belatedly endorsed the
negotiating efforts of Chernomyrdin by embracing a draft U.N.
Security Council resolution on ending the Yugoslav conflict.
</P>
<P>
   His commitment was reinforced by two telephone calls in the past
two days from President Clinton, as Washington strove to keep the
Russians on board.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Russian politics has left its imprint on the peacemaking
process in these and other ways that are still not entirely clear.
</P>
<P>
   The draft U.N. resolution, hammered out by Western and Russian
foreign ministers in Cologne on Tuesday, seeks to allay Russian
anxieties by avoiding any direct reference to NATO's plan to
command 50,000 peacekeepers in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials described the omission as
little more than a sop to Moscow and insist that the Kremlin is
under no illusion about the allies' plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have told the Russians every step of the way that the only
force that will work and that we will support is one that has NATO
at its core,'' a senior Clinton administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   But some Western officials worry that the studied vagueness in
the text will be exploited by the Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the intent was to come up with a fuzzy document that the
Russians could agree to, the foreign ministers achieved their
purpose,'' one diplomat said. ``If the intent was to clarify the
nature of the international security presence that would be
deployed in Kosovo, that presence was left undefined.''
</P>
<P>
   The West's decision to include the Russians in a Kosovo
settlement was one of the most fateful moves in the complex Balkan
diplomacy. The aim was to increase the diplomatic pressure on the
Milosevic regime. NATO also hoped to avoid a complete rupture with
Moscow, which has objected bitterly to the NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   But negotiating with Moscow has not been easy. Yeltsin has an
enormous political stake in seeing the war brought to a close and
ending the criticism that Russia's power had dwindled so much on
his watch that the Kremlin was powerless to stop NATO's air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Having railed against NATO expansion, Moscow finds it
excruciatingly difficult to endorse a settlement brought about by
allied bombing and which places NATO troops firmly in charge of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is motivated less by a desire to help Belgrade than by
its worries about NATO's willingness to flex muscles in a region
that Moscow long considered to be within its sphere of influence.

 MOSCOW: of influence. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Russian policy has oscillated between bitter
criticism and cooperation. Russia started off assailing NATO policy
from the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Then Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov went to Belgrade with two
top intelligence officials. It was not clear whether Primakov was
there to help bring about a settlement or encourage Milosevic to
resist.
</P>
<P>
   Russia began to cooperate more with NATO after Chernomyrdin
became the envoy. A former prime minister and former head of
Russia's gas industry, Chernomyrdin is a pragmatist who has long
favored strong ties with West.
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of Western officials, Chernomyrdin succeeded, not by
presenting his own plan, but by endorsing the NATO demands carried
to Belgrade by Ahtisaari. That made Chernomyrdin an easy target for
critics at home. So bitter is the criticism that Chernomyrdin's
dreams of reviving his political career seem to be all but dead.
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive to the nationalist sentiment, Yeltsin did not leap to
Chernomyrdin's defense. The Kremlin's silence emboldened the
military.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Col. Gen. Leonid Ivashov, the head of the Defense
Ministry's department for international military cooperation, was
publicly challenging the agreement. At the Macedonia talks,
Barmyantsev urged the Serbs not to agree to a NATO-led force.
</P>
<P>
   As the divisions widened, Yeltsin aides did their best to paper
over the obvious divisions in the ranks. Dmitri Yakushkin,
Yeltsin's spokesman, insisted in an interview that there were
differences of opinion but ``no contradictions'' within the Russian
delegation.
</P>
<P>
   As the Cologne meeting approached, however, Yeltsin was faced
with a difficult choice: work closely with NATO or watch the war
drag on. President Clinton tried to drive home the message by
telling Yeltsin in a phone call that a settlement would be imminent
if the Kremlin would put its full weight behind the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement on a U.N. resolution still leaves one thorny
issue: the role of Russian troops in Kosovo. The Russians have
offered to contribute up to 10,000 troops. The Kosovo Liberation
Army says that ethnic Albanians may be afraid to return to an area
controlled by such a large Russian force, given Moscow's sympathies
for Belgrade and its insistence that its troops not be under NATO
command.
</P>
<P>
   Washington hopes to work out an arrangement modeled on the
peacekeeping force in Bosnia in which the Russian troops indirectly
report to a NATO general. So far, however, a solution has proved
elusive. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott is coming to
Moscow to try to resolve the details.
</P>
<P>
   After a week of mixed signals, even Chernomyrdin's rivals sought
to put the best face on the diplomacy Tuesday. Ivanov defended the
draft resolution as the quickest way to bring an end to NATO
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any agreement is a compromise,'' Ivanov said. ``We had one
principal compromise, which is to end the war.''

FUGITIVE MEXICAN TELLS OF HUGE PAYMENT TO RULING PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ For years, the governing party in Mexico has
sought to keep its finances cloaked in secrecy. Industrialists who
have profited from government contracts and other insider dealings
have donated vast sums to underwrite the party's 70-year domination
of Mexican politics, with little or no public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   But a political storm erupted here in the last week after Carlos
Cabal Peniche, a banker who fled Mexico five years ago, began
relating for the first time his own huge donations to the party,
the Institutional Revolutionary Party, before the last presidential
election, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   From a prison in Australia, where he is fighting extradition
proceedings, Cabal has described how he collected $25 million from
associates and channeled the money to the party, known as the PRI.
That included about $5 million that was donated during the 1994
campaign of President Ernesto Zedillo, Cabal said recently in
written statements.
</P>
<P>
   Through a spokesman, Zedillo on Saturday said he had no personal
knowledge of Cabal's contributions to his campaign or the party.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, however, in a written response to questions that were
transmitted to Cabal through his Australian spokesman, Cabal said
he had discussed the donations personally in a face-to-face
encounter with Zedillo. He said he met Zedillo at the PRI's Mexico
City headquarters on Jan. 12, 1994, when Zedillo was still the
campaign coordinator for the PRI's presidential candidate, Luis
Donaldo Colosio. Colosio was assassinated a few months later and
Zedillo went on to become the PRI's candidate and to win the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the meeting well,'' Cabal said.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo's spokesman, Fernando Lerdo de Tejada, said Tuesday that
Zedillo ``never discussed campaign donations, not with Carlos Cabal
Peniche nor with any person. That was not his role as campaign
coordinator.''
</P>
<P>
   Cabal has been charged in Mexico with financial fraud amounting
to $700 million, and was an international fugitive before his
arrest in Australia last November. His decision to provide details
about what he says are some of the PRI's back-room secrets appears
to be part of his legal campaign to avoid extradition to Mexico,
where he has been accused of fraud in connection with the collapse
of his banks. Mexican officials have portrayed him as an inveterate
liar, but so far, nothing they have said about his disclosures have
shown him to be telling tales.
</P>
<P>
   The political donations Cabal has described appear to have been
legal under the free-for-all election rules that prevailed in
Mexico in 1993 and 1994, officials of the Federal Electoral
Institute said. The rules were tightened somewhat in a 1996
campaign finance reform law backed by Zedillo. The Institute voted
last month that it lacked the power to investigate further into the
PRI's 1994 campaign finances.
</P>
<P>
   The transactions may, however, have constituted fraud or other
financial crimes, according to a criminal complaint filed last
September by the opposition Party of the Democratic Revolution.
Leaders of the party, known as the PRD, based the complaint on
documents they obtained that detail many of the financial
transactions Cabal is now acknowledging.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint, which Attorney General Jorge Madrazo said he is
investigating, argues that Cabal used Banco Union, a bank he bought
from the government during a privatization drive, to extend some
$15 million in unsecured loans to associates, who in turn donated
the money the PRI. These transactions helped drive Banco Union into
insolvency in 1994, forcing the government to bail out the bank,
the complaint says.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition politicians who view Madrazo's handling of the
investigation as sluggish are now demanding a special prosecutor to
investigate the financing of the 1994 campaign that brought most of
the current leaders of Mexico's executive branch to power.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the result of the investigation, Cabal's claims have
altered the country's political landscape before the 2000
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dirty Money!'' was the front-page headline of the newsmagazine
Proceso, in an article about Cabal's assertions. The article quoted
several opposition congressmen saying that Cabal's money was dirty
because his banks had been used in what appeared to be a
money-laundering scheme with suspicious origins.
</P>
<P>
   Both opposition parties, the PRD and National Action, are using
the scandal to portray the PRI as a clique of reckless millionaires
whose financial abuses during the 1994 campaign caused the economic
meltdown that began in the first weeks of Zedillo's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexicans can no longer tolerate the complicities that keep a
small group in control of all political and economic power at the
cost of the impoverishment of the citizenry,'' National Action said
in a communique.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-1993, at the time Cabal says he began organizing
donations to the PRI, there were virtually no limits on how much
money corporations or individuals could give to political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Cabal says, and PRI leaders have acknowledged, that he collected
some 47 million pesos from his associates, then the equivalent of
about $15 million, and turned the money over to a PRI trust fund in
July 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1993, the PRI agreed to establish the first limits
on donations and spending. That step came after a damaging scandal
growing out of a private banquet organized by party leaders in
which 25 of Mexico's richest men were each asked to donate $25
million to the party.
</P>
<P>
   Under the limits, corporations were prohibited from making
political donations, and individuals were limited to about two
million pesos a year, then the equivalent of some $597,000.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the rules in effect when Cabal says he met with
Zedillo in January 1994 to discuss a new package of donations. As a
result of his conversations with Zedillo, Cabal says, he gave one
million pesos, then the equivalent of about $330,000, well below
the individual cap, to the PRI in May 1994. That donation is not
disputed by the party or the President.
</P>
<P>
   Cabal also ``promoted and facilitated'' donations by his
associates to the PRI at about the same time in an amount
approaching $5 million, he said in Tuesday's statement.
</P>
<P>
   Lerdo de Tejada, the presidential spokesman, has confirmed
Cabal's one million peso donation, but has denied that Cabal made
any other donation to either the Colosio or Zedillo presidential
campaigns. Other PRI leaders, however, have acknowledged that Cabal
assembled a $15 million donation for the party in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But Lerdo de Tejada denied categorically that Zedillo was aware
of any of Cabal's donations in 1993 or 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither as campaign coordinator for Luis Donaldo Colosio, nor
later, as candidate for the presidency, did President Ernesto
Zedillo have knowledge of any contribution whatsoever made by Mr.
Carlos Cabal Peniche to either of these campaigns,'' Lerdo said in
a statement issued Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Zedillo supported a campaign finance reform law that
established generous public financing for Mexican campaigns and
imposed reporting requirements on individual donations. But the
regulations apply only to the official party nominees, not
individual politicians seeking the nomination. Next year's
presidential campaign does not officially begin until January. As a
result, half a dozen informal candidates from all three major
parties are now collecting donations with no legal restrictions.

 &HT;    WNBA expanding teams, talent base
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The slogans have been catchy, even if the quality of
basketball has been lacking. But with the demise of a rival league
and the arrival of the most acclaimed female collegian ever, the
WNBA can boast a theme this summer that actually might live up to
the hype cranked out by the league's relentless publicity machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Got 'Mique.''
</P>
<P>
   The league hasn't unveiled any such catch phrase, and Chamique
Holdsclaw isn't all that's new as the WNBA tips off its third
season on Thursday. But the four-time Tennessee All-America player
is the pivotal figure in what should be a vastly improved league
that has expanded by two teams to 12 and will add four more next
season.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics bemoan the league as nothing more than the NBA's
summer ladies auxiliary, on the same plane with indoor soccer and
arena football. But the WNBA also includes 36 former American
Basketball League players and a growing contingent of international
stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no more talk about which league is best,'' said
former Georgia Tech star Kisha Ford, who will be in uniform for the
expansion Orlando Miracle on Thursday against the two-time
defending champion Houston Comets (8 p.m., Lifetime). ``We just
have to go out and play basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 24 players drafted in the first two rounds, 18 came from
the ABL, which filed for bankruptcy and folded in December.
Holdsclaw, the first pick of the woeful Washington Mystics (3-27)
who signed a seven-figure endorsement deal with Nike, has been an
instant attraction. In an exhibition game against the Comets last
week, Holdsclaw had 20 points, 10 rebounds and six assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all this will help us at a time when we recognize that
the novelty of the league has worn off,'' WNBA commissioner Val
Ackerman said. ``Our league is going to stand or fall on the basis
of how good a game we have and how much fans want to come and
support us.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston coach Van Chancellor, whose team faces Holdsclaw again
Saturday, said, ``Everybody in this league is so much better.
There's a great talent improvement. It's going to be a severe
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the league announced it would expand into Miami,
Indiana, Portland and Seattle for the 2000 season. The Atlanta
Hawks want a franchise, but they passed on next season because of
their impending move to the new Philips Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been on our radar screen from Day 1,'' Hawks executive
vice president Lee Douglas said. ``We want to maintain a basketball
presence 12 months out of the year. There is a completely different
audience than what comes to NBA games. It's an enterprise we feel
is worth doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks would be ready to go in 2001, but Ackerman said the
WNBA hasn't begun to consider future expansion. ``We didn't plan to
expand this quickly,'' she said. ``We need to see how we do in
these new cities, but I believe we will be in Atlanta someday.''
</P>
<P>
   The additional 44 playing slots next year were the result of an
agreement with the NBA Players Association, which represented WNBA
veterans. After a brief standoff, the two sides settled on raising
the minimum salary to $25,000 for rookies and capping the number of
ABL veterans at three per team. Players also get year-round health,
maternity and dental benefits and a share of WNBA merchandise
royalties.
</P>
<P>
   For ABL refugees like Kedra Holland-Corn, whose original league
had an average salary of $80,000, the cut in pay has prompted major
changes. The former University of Georgia guard is seeking playing
opportunities in Brazil or Europe in the winter. It's a route taken
by her Sacramento Monarchs teammate, ex-Georgia star Lady Hardmon,
who has played four seasons in Italy, Turkey and Hungary, and Ford,
who played in Sweden last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pay for your housing, your utility bills and your
benefits,'' Holland-Corn, a second-round draft pick, said. ``It's a
$50,000 job when you add it all up.''
</P>
<P>
   The ABL, which played in the fall and winter, went under after 2
1/2 seasons. Crowds were small, but the ABL claimed in its suit
that the WNBA used its muscle to prevent them from making
television and corporate sponsorship deals. The WNBA isn't
commenting on the allegations, which are being investigated by
attorneys general in five states.

GENERALS MEET AGAIN ON WITHDRAWAL OF KOSOVO FORCES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUMANOVO, Macedonia _ Two days after a first round of talks
ended in deadlock, NATO and Yugoslav generals met here again
Tuesday night to discuss the withdrawal of Yugoslav and Serbian
forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav delegation _ mostly the same officers who took part
in the earlier meetings _ arrived just after 9 p.m. local time in a
column of vehicles escorted by NATO liaison officers and Macedonian
police officials. The talks are being held in a hangar in the
center of a muddy French helicopter base in northeastern Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson, a Briton who is to lead the NATO
security force in Kosovo, arrived minutes later by helicopter. But
the Yugoslavs spent the next several hours in a small trailer
reviewing changes proposed to them in the six-page military
agreement they rejected only a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Three senior members of the Yugoslav delegation, including its
leader, Col. Gen. Svetozar Marjanovic, deputy chief of the army's
general staff, left the talks at 1 a.m. to cross into Yugoslavia
and consult with officials in Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, over
secure telephone lines. They returned an hour later and the talks
continued.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials, who say they are not negotiating with the
Yugoslavs, said there had been only ``small technical changes'' in
the agreement they proposed after the talks failed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one American military officer has been meeting with
the Yugoslavs since the talks collapsed: Lt. Gen. Robert Foglesong,
a military adviser to Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott,
held meetings with the Yugoslavs Monday and Tuesday, NATO officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   An allied official who took part in the weekend talks said the
completion of a draft resolution for the U.N. Security Council by
the major industrial nations and Russia increased the allies'
leverage here. But he said it would not resolve NATO's specific
role in a security force, the issue the Yugoslav officers cited
when they rejected the allies' terms over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The official warned that the Yugoslav officers could again
refuse to agree to the details of the withdrawal in the hope of
forcing the issue on the Security Council, where Russia and China
could insist on terms more favorable to Yugoslavia.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ One police officer was convicted on Tuesday of
joining in the torture of Abner Louima in a Brooklyn station house,
but three others were acquitted in the case, which transformed an
unknown Haitian immigrant into a national symbol of police
brutality.
</P>
<P>
   The convicted officer, Charles Schwarz, was found guilty of
violating Louima's civil rights by holding him down while another
officer, Justin Volpe, rammed a stick into his rectum in the
station house bathroom. Volpe pleaded guilty to the charges against
him two weeks ago and is awaiting final sentencing while in
custody.
</P>
<P>
   Two officers, Thomas Bruder and Thomas Wiese, were acquitted of
charges that they helped beat up Louima in a patrol car while
transporting him from a street brawl to the 70th precinct station
house. Sgt. Michael Bellomo, was acquitted of trying to cover up
the beating of Louima in the car and a separate assault by Volpe on
a second Haitian immigrant, Patrick Antoine. When the verdict
against him was announced in a packed federal courtroom in
Brooklyn, after an anonymous jury of seven men and five women had
deliberated for 18 hours, Schwarz, 33, initially stared straight
ahead and showed no reaction at all. But before being taken into
custody, Schwarz appeared to be glaring at the federal prosecutors
in the case, and his reaction to the verdict was one of
``disbelief, shock, rage,'' said his attorney, Stephen C. Worth.
Schwarz could be sentenced to as much as life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Worth, who said his client would appeal the verdict, said part
of the grounds for the appeal would be that the case was tainted by
the dramatic confession of Volpe who admitted two weeks ago that he
rammed the stick into Louima in order to humiliate him. In that
confession, which occurred outside the presence of the jury, Volpe
did not implicate any other officer by name.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe's plea on May 25, after three weeks of testimony,
dramatically changed the landscape of the trial, removing the
principal defendant and changing the focus of a prosecution that
had massed its artillery on him. The case against the four other
defendants was far less substantial. It took only two days after
Volpe's plea for the prosecution to conclude its case.
</P>
<P>
   The cases against Schwarz, Bruder and Wiese, who had been free
on $100,000 bail each since their indictments last year, were
largely circumstantial and less solid than the case against Volpe,
though the evidence against Schwarz appeared stronger than against
Wiese and Bruder.
</P>
<P>
   In a pointed attack on the ethics of the prosecution, the
attorney for Volpe criticized the way in which the verdict against
Schwarz was obtained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really disappointed in the fact that Officer Schwarz
was convicted,'' said Marvyn Kornberg, noting that his client
``advised the prosecutors that the other officer in the bathroom
was not Schwarz, but in fact, another officer whose name was given
to them at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked by reporters who that officer was, Kornberg refused to
divulge a name. Federal prosecutors angrily dismissed Kornberg's
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dare say that neither Volpe nor his attorney have any
credibility with respect to any factual issue touching on this
case, including the identity of the other officer or officers with
him,'' said Alan Vinegrad, one of the prosecutors, referring to
Kornberg's opening argument in the trial. Kornberg had suggested
that Louima might have suffered his internal injuries _ a torn
rectum and bladder - in a a consensual sexual encounter with
another man.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony Louima could not identify the officer who he
said held him down during Volpe's attack in the bathroom, but he
said it was done by the same officer who had driven him to the
station house. Police records indicate that Schwarz was the driver.
</P>
<P>
   Two policemen gave major testimony against Schwarz. Detective
Eric Turetzky and Officer Mark Schofield said they saw him walk
Louima, handcuffed and with his pants down, from station house desk
where he was booked on assault charges _ later dropped _ directly
to the bathroom area.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for Schwarz, Worth, who vigorously cross-examined
these witnesses, insisted that his client was never in the bathroom
with Louima and that Louima was mistaken in asserting that it was
the driver of the car who held him down. He emphasized that
Turetzky and Schofield had said they saw Schwarz taking Louima
toward the bathroom, but not into it.
</P>
<P>
   Wiese Schwarz and Bruder still face charges of conspiring to
obstruct justice by misleading investigators as to Schwarz's role
in the bathroom torture. Prosecutors point to Wiese's claim that he
saw Volpe alone in the bathroom with Louima.

 &HT;    Georgia firms among top Hispanic businesses
 &HT;    (EDS: CORRECTS to Norsan Group in 3rd graf.)
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Norberto Sanchez opened one small Mexican
restaurant in Norcross, Ga. in 1987, he barely dreamed of the day
his company would own nine restaurants _ two in Kentucky and the
rest in metro Atlanta _ along with four Mexican fast-food
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard work and more work were the main ingredients of
success,'' said Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Norsan Group also is a grocery and food distributor, and
a subsidiary distributes meat products to the hospitality industry.
Ten months ago, Sanchez said, the company opened its first
supermarket, called La Mexicana, in Norcross. Another is in the
works.
</P>
<P>
   As testament to the growth of Hispanic-owned business activity
in the metro area, a new bank, the United Americas Bank, will open
its doors in 60 days, with Sanchez as a member of the board and Sal
Diaz-Verson as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Norsan Group is among 10 Georgia-based, Hispanic-owned companies
to make the top 500 list in Hispanic Business magazine's annual
roundup. Companies were ranked by 1998 revenue. To participate,
companies must be 51 percent owned by U.S. citizens of Hispanic
descent and must have headquarters in the 50 states or Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the list reflects considerable growth by
Hispanic-owned companies. This year's list includes 81 companies
with revenue of $50 million or more. In 1994, only 53 companies
made that top bracket.
</P>
<P>
   ``The five-year data indicate that the Hispanic economy has
established a viable pipeline for producing large corporations in
the future,'' the magazine observed. The Georgia firms run the
gamut from food service and restaurants to engineering and natural
gas distribution. At Cape Environmental Management, President
Fernando Rios wants to quadruple his employee base and annual sales
in the next four years. Currently, the environmental engineering
company has 90 employees and $9.90 million in revenue. Lou Sobh,
whose auto dealership is the top-ranked Georgia company on the list
at No. 43, told the magazine he has rejected several buyout offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in this business a long time, and I want my kids to
be involved,'' he said. ``I have a daughter who is general manager
of one store, a son that's with me in another, and I'm looking at
opening more because another son wants it.''

WHITMAN PICKS WOMAN AS HER FOURTH APPOINTEE TO HIGH COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JERRY GRAY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Saying that she intended to create a more
diverse Supreme Court, Gov. Christie Whitman on Tuesday made her
second nomination in four months to the state's highest court,
picking Virginia Long, the presiding judge in the Appellate
Division of Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   Long, 57, would become the third woman on the seven-member
court, joining Chief Justice Deborah Poritz, whom Whitman appointed
three years ago, and Justice Marie Garibaldi.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I appointed Judge Poritz it was with an understanding on
my part that I wanted to see more women, qualified women, elevated
and given the opportunity to see what they can do,'' Whitman said.
``I don't have a quota system that there should be three or four,
whatever. But I do seek diversity _ youth, age, all sorts of
diversity on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman has used her three previous nominations to appoint the
first woman to be chief justice, Mrs. Poritz; the high court's
first black member, Justice James Coleman, and its youngest member,
Peter Verniero, who turned 40 in April.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman will have the chance to place at least one more person
on the Supreme Court next year because Justice Daniel O'Hern will
reach the mandatory retirement age of 70 on May 30.
</P>
<P>
   With the prospect of appointing at least five justices on the
state's highest court before she leaves office, Whitman has the
opportunity to change not only the demographics of one of the
nation's most respected benches, but also its views on issues from
the fate of death row inmates to the way New Jersey funds its
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   If confirmed by the state Senate, Long would replace Justice
Alan Handler, who in his 22 years has established himself as one of
the most liberal voices on the New Jersey Supreme Court. He is the
court's most outspoken opponent of capital punishment and, in
recent years, has taken the lead in rulings involving the long
fight over how rich and poor school districts in the state should
be financed.
</P>
<P>
   No new member of the court would be expected to have the kind of
influence that Justice Handler established. And it is not clear how
Long would vote on an issue like capital punishment; appeals of
death sentences in New Jersey are handled only by the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Long is considered moderate to liberal, court officials who have
worked with her said. But meeting with reporters Tuesday, Long
declined to assign herself a political label.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decide the cases based on merits,'' she said. ``I treat
everybody the way I would like to be treated, and I write opinions
that leave no doubt as to what it is that I'm saying and where
exactly I stand. Whether that's liberal or conservative in each
individual case depends on whose ox is being gored.''
</P>
<P>
   Long is a Democrat, as is Handler. By tradition, New Jersey
governors have maintained a balance of Democrats and Republicans
among the six associate justices on the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said Tuesday that she had never queried her choices
about how they would rule on individual issue. ``I don't know, I
don't want to know,'' Whitman told reporters. ``I try to be as
un-litmus-test-oriented as I can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Long's nomination comes only a month after the Senate narrowly
confirmed Verniero at the end of a bruising political fight between
Democrats and Whitman that was shaped in some part by the
governor's anticipated run next year for the Republican nomination
for U.S. senator and by the controversy over racial profiling by
the state police.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats, who had criticized Verniero as unqualified to
sit on the Supreme Court, were guarded Tuesday in their comments
about Long. But they seized the opportunity to revive their attacks
on the governor over the earlier nomination and over her decision
not to submit future court nominees to a review panel of the New
Jersey State Bar Association after the group soundly rejected
Verniero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, a unanimous approval for Judge Long would have
highlighted the panel's overwhelming rejection of Peter Verniero
based on his lack of qualifications,'' said state Sen. John Lynch,
the senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which
reviews nominations to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said again Tuesday that the governor
would not send Long before the Bar Association's review panel, a
practice that New Jersey governors have observed for 30 years, and
one that Whitman followed in her first three nominations. But Long
held out the prospect that she could go before the panel on her
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the governor's decision,'' Long said, ``but she's made
it clear to me that if the Bar Association wants me to appear, it's
fine with her if I do. And if they do ask me to appear, I will be
there on their doorstep.''
</P>
<P>
   Long was named to the Superior Court in 1978 by Gov. Brendan
Byrne, a Democrat. Six years later, she was named to the Appellate
Division, the level just below the Supreme Court, and in 1995

 &HT;    Senators throw support behind Gore
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in (w) Washington and (p) Politics categories.)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Retired Ohio senator Howard Metzenbaum led a cadre
of former senators Tuesday in endorsing Vice President Al Gore for
president in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In a basement ballroom at the posh Mayflower Renaissance Hotel,
the group of 10 former senators jovially confronted perceptions of
Gore as stiff and bland in an endorsement rally focused on
reversing the negative implications of that image rather than
disputing it
</P>
<P>
   ``Many things that happen in public life that are dramatic are
not good governance,'' said former senator Mike Gravel of Alaska.
``Al Gore is very competent.''
</P>
<P>
   Howell Heflin of Alabama, who supported Gore before he teamed
with President Clinton in 1988, said that while the ``elitist
media'' has branded Gore wooden, that characterization isn't
entirely bad since it conveys stability and strength. And he said
Gore will be plenty colorful when needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out he is a terrific campaigner,'' Heflin boomed,
``and don't sell him short on hitting the campaign trail and
getting people to vote for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen former senators endorsed the Gore campaign Tuesday,
though only half made it to the hotel event. Those who did stressed
Gore's experience as a former member of the House and Senate,
arguing as Metzenbaum did that ``there is no person better trained
to be President.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore faces a primary challenge by another former senator, Bill
Bradley of New Jersey. But the Mayflower gathering seemed targeted
at Gore's standing in the general election where polls say he would
be an underdog to the Republican's front-running candidate, Texas
Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the debates come, you'll see the difference,'' between
Gore and his opponents, said Wendell Ford of Kentucky. ``When the
debates come that'll separate them pretty good.''

IBM EXECUTIVE TESTIFIES ON MEETING WITH MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At a private meeting in March 1997, a Microsoft
executive told IBM that the computer maker would pay a lower price
for Microsoft's Windows operating system if it did not ship a
competing Internet browser, an IBM executive testified Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With his handwritten notes of the meeting introduced as evidence
in the Microsoft antitrust trial, Garry Norris of IBM recounted the
meeting and the proposal by an executive of Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   One notebook entry, written in a crimped script, stated that the
Microsoft executive said if IBM agreed to ``no Netscape'' _ a
reference to Microsoft's main rival in Internet browsing software,
Netscape Communications Corp. _ on its machines, then IBM would
receive a lower price for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   When a Justice Department lawyer asked Norris why he wrote three
asterisks alongside that entry, he testified, ``When he said `no
Netscape,' I thought that was very important.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's case against Microsoft focuses mainly on the
software maker's reportedly illegal conduct to thwart the challenge
posed by Internet software. In the trial, which began last October,
the testimony by Norris is the first time a PC maker has said that
Microsoft proposed tying Windows' price not just to promoting the
Microsoft browser but to excluding Netscape's.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft spokesman said the company had no information that
such an offer was made in March 1997. ``Certainly, no such proposal
was ever pursued or consummated,'' said Mark Murray, the company
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In his second day of testimony, Norris, who negotiated with
Microsoft for IBM's personal computer division from 1995 to 1997,
provided further testimony that Microsoft tried to use its market
power to prod PC makers to favor Microsoft products over competing
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The currency of Microsoft's approval or disapproval, Norris
testified, is often the complex pricing formula for its
industry-standard Windows operating system. The confidential
pricing agreements are detailed ``market development agreements,''
or MDAs, between Microsoft and PC makers. They give PC makers
discounts on their Windows price for promoting and supporting
Windows in various ways.
</P>
<P>
   In his notes on one meeting, Norris stated that Microsoft
executives pushed hard for shipping Internet Explorer exclusively
on its machines. ``If not,'' he wrote, ``MDA repercussions.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Norris acknowledged that IBM did eventually reach an
agreement with Microsoft in 1997 to distribute Internet Explorer,
and the pact did not include any of the exclusivity that he said
Microsoft had proposed. IBM chose to ship both Netscape and
Internet Explorer, so it did not try to obtain the MDA discounts,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's cross-examination of Norris began shortly before the
lunchtime break. Shortly into the afternoon session, Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson seemed to suggest that Microsoft faced a challenge
in trying to refute the testimony of Norris.
</P>
<P>
   When Jackson raised questions about documents Microsoft wanted
to introduce as evidence, a Microsoft lawyer offered to bring to
court two people to vouch for the documents _ Joachim Kempin or
Mark Baber. Both Microsoft executives were mentioned frequently by
Norris as messengers of the effort to get IBM not to ship software
that competed with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mr. Kempin or Mr. Baber are called,'' the judge replied,
``there is a lot more they will have to testify about beyond these
documents.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge then permitted the documents to be introduced. There
were three draft proposals for an alliance agreement between IBM
and Microsoft, which would have resulted in IBM's obtaining the
same Windows price as Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals, drafted in 1994, indicated that IBM was being
offered increasing freedom to ship and promote other products
including its own OS/2 operating system, which competed with
Microsoft's Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The first draft proposal said IBM would ``primarily promote
Microsoft desktop software platforms'' _ a reference to Windows and
Windows NT. A later draft said IBM must be ``committed to promote''
Microsoft's software, ``but not exclusive to products offered by
other divisions of IBM'' _ a reference to IBM's OS/2.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his testimony, Norris said that Microsoft demanded
that IBM ``reduce, drop or eliminate'' its support for OS/2 to
obtain the favored price for Windows.

GROOMING A SERIOUS CHALLENGER TO LOCAL LATE-NIGHT NEWS  
 BY JOHN CARMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When they think about local TV news at PBS, they
wince and picture a live remote shot of a bubbleheaded reporter
standing in a pool of blood.
</P>
<P>
   This is, of course, a grossly unfair depiction. Many local TV
reporters are not bubbleheaded.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea is that PBS' commercial cousins are steeped in gore
rather than ``serious'' news, and the people who bring you
``NewsHour With Jim Lehrer'' want to do something about it.
MacNeil-Lehrer Productions is reviving plans to assemble a national
newscast at 11 p.m. weekdays, without the low comedy of local news.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no one at that hour of the day who's providing
responsible national and international coverage,'' says
``NewsHour'' executive producer Les Crystal, in San Francisco for
this week's annual PBS meeting. ``It gets extremely short shrift on
local news. It's been a vacuum for ages.''
</P>
<P>
   A vacuum that MacNeil-Lehrer Productions hopes to fill with a
nightly 30-minute newscast in partnership with the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   The program would tap into the Times for the expertise of its
correspondents in a hard-news broadcast summarizing the day's news
and peeking at what the next day's news is likely to be.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Werner, president of MacNeil-Lehrer Productions, says the
news program would be a tidy lead-in to the nightly Charlie Rose
talk show on many PBS stations.
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds sensible. Admirable, even. But this is PBS, and
nothing at PBS is built in a day. In fact, some things never get
built at all.
</P>
<P>
   There's the usual problem of underwriting. Werner concedes that
not a dime is committed to the program yet, and it would take six
to eight months to get on the air even after the project is fully
funded.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the vagaries of PBS' byzantine system of
scheduling, and station clearances, and differing notions about
priorities, and petty jealousies, and public TV pooh-bahs guarding
their fiefdoms like medieval lords.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it's not outside the emotional repertoire of
someone else providing news and public affairs programming at PBS
to question why MacNeil-Lehrer should be awarded more airtime than
it already has.
</P>
<P>
   And I get the feeling that there is, inside PBS, some polite ire
over a perception that MacNeil-Lehrer is pushing a little too hard,
a little too early and possibly a little too publicly.
</P>
<P>
   It's a little like a professor buying billboard space and
commercial airtime to campaign for tenure.
</P>
<P>
   (For the record, Crystal was in town for an unrelated panel
discussion at the PBS meeting. He and Werner didn't seek out
publicity.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel it's a bit premature to have this out of the box,''
said John Wilson, who's been on the job only a few weeks as PBS'
acting head of programming.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said there is, so far, no more than ``anecdotal''
evidence that an audience exists for an 11 p.m. PBS newscast.
</P>
<P>
   Also, where would the newscast be based? New York, home of the
Times? Or Washington, home of ``NewsHour''? And, sure, there are
possible problems with stations clearing the time.
</P>
<P>
   It's advisable, Wilson said, to regard the proposed newscast as
``a work in progress'' and not a done deal.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But even as he was flinging pails of water onto the plan, Wilson
allowed himself a little wistfulness over the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are, after all, MacNeil-Lehrer Productions,'' he said of
the company that generates TV's straightest, most informative
newscast.
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' Wilson added, ``a few people might have heard of this
thing called the New York Times.''
</P>
<P>
   Other news from the PBS annual meeting:
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; Megan Follows will return to star in a third ``Anne of Green
Gables'' miniseries, this one called ``The Continuing Story.'' Odd
that the announcement would be made in San Francisco. PBS said, in
rejecting ``More Tales of the City'' a few years ago, that it
doesn't do sequels.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; Crystal said PBS would forge ahead with its own political
convention coverage next year without NBC News, its partner in 1992
and 1996. NBC broke off with PBS because it now has the MSNBC cable
news channel.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; Crystal also said ``NewsHour'' anchor Jim Lehrer hoped to
entice the major presidential candidates next year into a series of
joint conversations about the issues. This would be separate from
the formal presidential debates, Crystal said, and presumably less
adversarial.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; Mike Sullivan, executive producer of ``Frontline,'' said
that program was preparing a four-part series examining the federal
government's war on drugs. Sullivan said ``Frontline'' also was
considering ``a big takeout on the Clinton administration at its
end, trying to figure out what (set ital)was(end ital) that.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; PBS is planning to use high-profile voice talent for its
documentary series ``The American President,'' scheduled to
premiere in April. Providing George Washington's voice: Walter
Cronkite. And giving voice to Herbert Hoover will be former  &LR; Sen.
 &LR; Bob Dole.

SERBS PREPARING TO LEAVE KOSOVO, ALLIES REPORT
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT with CRAIG WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO has seen signs that the Yugoslav military is
preparing to withdraw at least some of its 40,000 troops from
Kosovo, the Pentagon said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   There are no indications yet that any Yugoslav troops are
leaving Kosovo, said Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon. But he added
that the Serb authorities were ``mobilizing vehicles and other
means to transport people out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've certainly seen preparations for moving out,'' Bacon told
reporters, noting that the Yugoslav chief of staff, Gen. Dragoljub
Ojdanic, said over the weekend that a peace deal would allow
soldiers to go home to their families.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentagon offered no other details that indicated the
Serbs were moving toward withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting has continued along the border with Albania. The
Pentagon said Serb forces had become vulnerable to attack in recent
days, as they massed while withdrawing from defensive positions. On
Sunday two battalions were hit by 500-pound unguided bombs on
Sunday, the Pentagon said, and a Pentagon official said hundreds of
the troops might have been killed and wounded.
</P>
<P>
   In the bombing on Sunday, NATO B-52s caught two Yugoslav army
battalions in the open near Mount Pastrik, and bombed them, Bacon
said.
</P>
<P>
   While there are signs of a Yugoslav withdrawal, an allied
spokesman in Brussels, Maj. Gen. Walter Jertz, said that Serb units
from the interior appeared to be moving with heavy equipment to
reinforce units already positioned near Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Serb forces lobbed shells into Albanian territory Tuesday at
numerous spots, and heavy fighting was reported near Mount Pastrik
and Junik, Jertz said.
</P>
<P>
   Allied leaders warned President Slobodan Milosevic that the NATO
bombing, scaled back after Thursday's announced peace deal but then
intensified after the Yugoslavs broke off military talks, would
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Before military talks started again in Macedonia on Tuesday
night, the allies stepped up the pressure on Milosevic, ratcheting
up strikes against strategic targets in Serbia overnight Monday.
Allied warplanes bombed oil storage yards at Novi Sad and Pancevo
and at Batjnica airfield outside Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this depends on Milosevic's accepting the terms of the
military technical agreement, and abiding by it,'' Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said Tuesday in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Albright traveled to Brussels to brief the NATO military
commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, and NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana on the agreement on a draft Security Council resolution
reached Tuesday in Cologne, Germany, by the United States, Russia
and six other industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
   The draft agreement asks for U.N. blessing, but makes clear that
the NATO peacekeeping force will take orders only from a British
officer, Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson, according to allied officials
here. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Allied officials said that Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott and a State Department military adviser, Lt. Gen. Robert
Foglesong, would open talks with Russian officers in Moscow on
Wednesday to work out a way for Russian troops to join the
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is wary about how Russia may play a role in Kosovo,
but Foglesong, who is the top assistant to Gen. Henry Shelton, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will make the Pentagon's
views known.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The first of nearly 50,000 NATO peacekeepers are to begin moving
into Kosovo within days of a final agreement. The peacekeeping
force, known as KFOR and nearly the size of the one that entered
Bosnia, which is much larger, in 1995, will divide the province
into five sectors, each overseen by one of NATO's five largest
members: the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   A European force of 16,000 soldiers now in Macedonia under
Jackson's command is likely to enter Kosovo first, Bacon said
Tuesday, followed by the first of 7,000 American troops.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,900 Marines now aboard ships in the Aegean and 1,700
Army soldiers in Albania, would link up near the Macedonia border
with Kosovo, and move in behind the European troops within 72 to 96
hours of an order to move out, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans will set up a headquarters in Gnjilane, in
southeastern Kosovo, initially under the command of Brig. Gen. John
Craddock.
</P>
<P>
   These American ``enabling forces,'' as the overall initial entry
force is called, would include infantrymen from the 82nd Airborne
Division, four Cobra and eight Apache helicopter gunships,
105-millimeter howitzers, Bradley fighting vehicles and M1A1 Abrams
tanks. The Apache gunships, though stationed there for two months,
were not used in combat because the Pentagon feared they were
vulnerable to air defense systems.
</P>
<P>
   Additional Army forces will arrive from Germany to fill out the
United States complement.
</P>
<P>
   As peacekeepers go in, their first task will be clear land mines
and booby traps left by Yugoslav troops. Under the agreement, the
Yugoslavs are to help identify minefields and possibly help clear
them.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, NATO's job is to provide a secure environment to allow
the return to their homes of upwards of a million ethnic Albanians
that Milosevic's forces expelled from the province.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate that 50 percent of all the refugees will want to
return quickly and to be home well before the end of the summer,''
NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But many Pentagon officials are more wary. ``This is going to be
a daunting mission,'' Bacon said.

GM TO BUY BANK OF NEW YORK COMMERCIAL LENDING UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ General Motors Corp. agreed Tuesday to buy the Bank of
New York's commercial lending unit for $1.8 billion as the
automaker diversified its holdings and the bank continued to
specialize its operations.
</P>
<P>
   GM's lending unit, General Motors Acceptance Corp., said it
would add BNY Financial Corp. and its affiliates as a new unit by
the end of the month. ``We're buying this for growth,'' said
William Muir, GMAC's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``While auto finance remains our core and our largest business,
it is a mature business, just like the automobile business is a
mature business,'' Muir said. ``We've had to look at nonautomotive
opportunities for growth.'' The new subsidiary will be called GMAC
Commercial Credit Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The deal announced Tuesday risked the ire of the United
Automobile Workers union, which has opposed automakers' past
attempts to diversify.
</P>
<P>
   For the bank, the deal fit a pattern of concentrating on
fee-based operations while selling off other businesses. It sold
the last of its credit card operations to Chase Manhattan Bank in
October 1997 and it announced in March that it would buy a
pension-fund services company, RBS Trust Bank, from the Royal Bank
of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   ``This transaction further advances our overall strategy, which
is to focus on our higher-growth fee-based activities, including
securities servicing, cash processing and fiduciary services,''
said Thomas Renyi, the chairman and chief executive of the Bank of
New York.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the unit's sale would dilute earnings by 2 percent
to 3 percent this year but would pay off later.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of New York said that it would have a pretax gain of
$1.1 billion on the deal and that it planned to buy back 30 million
of its shares with the proceeds. Since December 1998, the bank has
bought back about 18 million shares. Its shares rose $2.375
Tuesday, to $37.0625, while GM fell $1.375, to $67.75.
</P>
<P>
   For GM, the deal has the opposite effect. Buying the customers
and staff of the nation's largest asset-based lending and factoring
business has nothing to do with cars or car loans. Both asset-based
lending and factoring are specialized forms of business lending.
</P>
<P>
   Asset-based lenders make secured loans to companies that cannot
otherwise readily borrow from commercial banks or the debt market.
Such loans are often used for inventory financing or equipment
financing, with the inventory or equipment serving as collateral
for the loans. Lenders typically charge 2 percent to 4 percent
above prime lending rates for the credit.
</P>
<P>
   In factoring, which is common in the textile industry, a
financial institution buys a company's accounts receivable,
immediately paying the company what a third party owes it. In
exchange for the payment, the company effectively pays the factor a
high interest rate on the money. The financial institution then
assumes the risk while collecting what is owed to the first
company.
</P>
<P>
   Muir said the strategy was to make commercial lending GMAC's
fourth major business. The auto finance unit generated $984 million
of the $1.33 billion GMAC earned last year, with its insurance
business accounting for $226 million of the profits and its
mortgage business generating $115 million. Since the early 1990s,
GMAC had concentrated on expanding its mortgage and insurance
business, and it planned to do the same for the commercial finance
business. GMAC accounted for nearly a third of GM's net income of
$2.96 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   While Muir declined to disclose details, he said the new
business would start out smaller than GMAC's $115-million-a-year
mortgage business. But he said GMAC would try to expand the
business internationally by expanding its British unit to the
European market.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which is expected to be approved by antitrust
regulators, will not lead to layoffs at the Bank of New York unit,
which has 900 employees, or at GMAC, which already has a small
factoring and asset-backed lending arm, Muir said. He expected the
new unit to post a return on earnings this year of 14 percent to 15
percent.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE BEN HOGAN ROOM SPEAKS WELL FOR A QUIET MAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAR HILLS, N.J. _ As she walked around the Ben Hogan Room from
one exhibit to another, Valerie Hogan seemed to be reliving their
62 years together. Here were her husband's trophies, his awards,
his 1953 irons in a leather golf bag, his books, even the sports
jackets and shirts that were in his locker at the Shady Oaks
Country Club near their Fort Worth, Texas, home when he died in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   In her soft blue suit, the white-haired Valerie Hogan suddenly
stopped to gather herself emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized what I was seeing and I realized he was not here,''
she would say later. ``I would give anything if he could be here
even if I were not here. Just for him to see this beautiful room
and to know that people appreciate his contribution to golf.''
</P>
<P>
   In other years, the United States Golf Association created
separate rooms for two other golfers, Bobby Jones and Francis
Ouimet, at its museum here at Golf House, but they were amateurs.
Ben Hogan is the first professional golfer so honored.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Hogan's trophies and memorabilia were on display at
the Colonial Country Club in Fort Worth, but after two burglaries
there, he changed his will, granting them to Golf House where,
beginning Wednesday, they will be on display, free of charge. ``The
burglaries made us realize we needed to put them in a safer
place,'' Valerie Hogan said. ``When we made our last will, it
wasn't that Ben was ill. We wanted to get that changed.''
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who remembers when Ben Hogan was the world's best
golfer, the exhibit is a treasure. Here is the 1-iron he hit to the
18th green at the 1950 U.S. Open at Merion, Pa., to force an
18-hole playoff with Lloyd Mangrum and George Fazio that he won the
next day, 18 months after his legs were shattered in his Cadillac's
head-on collision with a bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The night before that last round,'' Valerie Hogan said, ``he
was so tired, I didn't think he would be able to play the next
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is the the gold Hickok Belt he was awarded as the
Associated Press male athlete of the year in 1953, when he won the
Masters, the U.S. Open and the British Open _ the only golfer to
win those three major titles in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't want to go to the British Open,'' Valerie Hogan
said. ``He kept saying, `I just think you want me to go over there
to see me get beat.'''
</P>
<P>
   Here are his four USGA gold medals for winning the United States
Open in 1948, 1950, 1951 and 1953. Nearby is a similar gold USGA
medal for winning the 1942 Hale America National Open, a World War
II substitute for that year's canceled United States Open. With
6,519 entries as well as local and sectional qualifying, it had the
atmosphere of a United States Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medal for the Hale America Open is the exact same medal
with the USGA seal that Ben received when he won the U.S. Open the
other four years,'' Valerie Hogan said. ``He always thought it was
unfair for the PGA to count Byron Nelson's PGA Championship in 1942
with a smaller field, and for the USGA not to count the 1942 Hale
America Open that he won.''
</P>
<P>
   In that Hale America Open at Ridgemoor outside Chicago, Hogan,
with a second-round 62 in a 17-under-par 271, won by three strokes
over Jimmy Demaret and Mike Turnesa. Nelson finished fourth. If the
USGA counted that wartime Open as a United States Open, Hogan would
hold the record with five instead of sharing the record with Jack
Nicklaus and Bobby Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you look on the back of that medal,'' said David Fay,
the USGA executive director, ``it says, `Hale America Open,' not
`United States Open.'''
</P>
<P>
   And over here in the exhibit is the sound of Ben Hogan's voice,
firm and precise, for about 10 minutes, as recorded in a 1951
interview by Si Burick of The Dayton (Ohio) News:
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, concentration is the business side of golf. Swinging
the golf club is incidental. I won more tournaments playing badly
than I ever did playing good. I try to outwork 'em and I try to
outmanage 'em. The shots I miss, they don't bother me because I
anticipate those. You're lucky if you hit three shots that you
actually like in 18 holes.''
</P>
<P>
   To hear that voice is a bonus because when Ben Hogan was
playing, he was more of a listener than a talker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben liked to say that people who talk all the time don't learn
anything,'' Valerie Hogan said. ``You have to listen; that's when
you learn. Believe me, he listened.''
</P>
<P>
   And he learned so much, Golf House created a room for him. &QL;

PATRIOTS CUT CANTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ After two seasons of trying to make something of
their former No. 1 draft choice, the Patriots decided to cut their
losses by cutting Chris Canty.
</P>
<P>
   Canty made his mark not for his play at cornerback, where he was
an occasional nickel back and briefly a starter of minimal impact,
but rather for his impromptu dancing after what he perceived to be
big plays. More than a few times they were in response to a tackle
after a pass completion, a show of bad judgment that fans,
teammates, and coaches wondered about from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree it was that judgment, or lack of it, that led to
his dismissal three days before the opening of the final offseason
minicamp. Canty, who had been only an occasional participant in the
team's offseason conditioning program, failed to hold a starting
position last season after one was opened up for him with the trade
of Jimmy Hitchcock to the Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   Canty started the first nine games but was replaced by Steve
Israel as soon as Israel was healthy enough to return to the field;
he missed the first half of the season with a recurring knee
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Canty compounded the mounting case against him when he was
arrested last season after police found him asleep in his Mercedes
at a gas station at 2 a.m., some six hours before he was to have
been at practice, with a container of an alcoholic beverage in the
car. Like most things that were near Canty during his two years in
New England, the container was open.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots made Canty their No. 1 pick in 1997, the 29th
overall selection. It was the first pick made solely by vice
president of personnel Bobby Grier, and it was not a good one. To
take him, New England passed up a cornerback with better size,
speed, and skill: Louisville's Sam Madison, who went on to become a
starter last year in his second season with the Miami Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Canty, meanwhile, continued to be plagued by a lack of
explosiveness. Lacking size (5 feet 9 inches on tiptoes, 185
pounds) and the speed undersized corners need to survive in the
NFL, Canty simply could not stay with the game's great receivers
and was further hampered by the fact that guys such as Keyshawn
Johnson towered over him.
</P>
<P>
   But the final straw for the Patriots was his lack of commitment
to the offseason fitness program and a laissez-faire attitude in
general toward his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy was given a tremendous opportunity last year,'' said
Patriots coach Pete Carroll. ``We made a commitment to Chris last
year and he didn't take advantage of the opportunity. When you add
everything up, it was time to let him go.''
</P>
<P>
   Symptomatic of Canty's attitude was the fact that when Carroll
went to cut him, the coach had to find him by phone because he was
not at the team's complex Tuesday, as many other players were. This
had been the case for much of the offseason after Canty claimed to
have suffered a rash caused by a reaction to the team's laundry.
</P>
<P>
   It is the same laundry worn by every other player in attendance,
none of whom seemed to break out in hives at the thought of
strength and conditioning coach Johnny Parker's regimented
workouts.
</P>
<P>
   Rash actions and, finally, a rash itself spelled the end for
Canty after just two seasons in New England. It was a short run for
a short man at a position not long on patience.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have begun to search the league discount table.
Tuesday they brought in former Giants No. 1 draft choice Derek
Brown, a tight end who had seven receptions for 89 yards last
season in Oakland after spending the previous two seasons as an
occasional starter in Jacksonville. On Thursday, they will take a
look at running back Harold Green, who rushed for 37 yards on 20
carries for the Falcons last year. Green is a nine-year veteran who
began his career in Cincinnati, where he played six seasons and was
a 1992 Pro Bowl selection after rushing for 1,170 yards.

NEIGHBORHOOD RESIDENTS CALL LOUIMA VERDICT NEITHER OUTRAGE NOR
TRIUMPH
</HEADLINE>
  (With LOUIMA-TRIAL, LOUIMA-ASSESS)  
 (bl)  
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the Oprah Winfrey show was interrupted by a news
bulletin announcing the verdict in the Abner Louima trial,
Charmaine Dreckette took a quick break from washing a customer's
hair in the back of St. Cecile's Unisex Salon on Church Avenue in
Brooklyn and turned up the volume.
</P>
<P>
   One of the four police officers charged with violating the civil
rights of Louima, a Haitian immigrant, was convicted, she learned.
And her own verdict was swift.
</P>
<P>
   ``All four of them, I feel, are guilty,'' declared Ms.
Dreckette, 29, an immigrant from Jamaica. ``All of them should go
to jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on a barber's chair up front, Eddie Joseph, 35, said he
was neither surprised nor entirely unhappy to learn that the jury
had convicted only Charles Schwarz, the officer charged with
holding Louima down while another officer, Justin Volpe, sodomized
him with a stick. Volpe pleaded guilty May 25, midway through the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   But Joseph, a Haitian immigrant who drops in to chat with
friends at St. Cecile's on his way home from his job as a cook in
Manhattan, said that what really angered him was the suggestion by
Volpe's lawyer, Marvyn Kornberg, that the injuries suffered by
Louima were not the result of the attack, but of a consensual sex
act.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair enough,'' Joseph, 35, said, speaking of the verdict.
``But my only question is about this lawyer _ coming out and saying
this was a gay nightclub, saying this was a consensual thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The voices in this barbershop were much like the voices
throughout Flatbush, the heart of Caribbean Brooklyn, as news of
the verdict trickled in Tuesday. There were many who regarded a
partial conviction as patently unfair, but their emotions were
nowhere as hot as the late afternoon sun.
</P>
<P>
   Life seemed to go on as usual in this dense strip of roti
take-outs and money transfer shops. People sat in their doorways,
trying to catch an afternoon breeze, and mothers braided their
children's hair under the shade of sidewalk trees. Women sold
plastic bags of cloves and cinnamon on the street, and police cars
circled the streets.
</P>
<P>
   At the studios of Radio Soleil, a Haitian radio station housed
inside a Nostrand Avenue storefront, Ricot Dupuy, the manager, said
the verdict carried a certain sense of vindication. ``It's clear
that Abner Louima has been vindicated in the sense that nobody can
say the man fabricated the story,'' he said. ``I take comfort in
the fact that you can't call this a brutal miscarriage of justice:
two of five people were found guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the mood among Haitians, Dupuy said the handful of people
who had been calling into the station Tuesday afternoon did not
believe that only two policemen could have been responsible for a
crime so brutal. Still, they seemed to share his own lukewarm sense
of satisfaction. ``They were hoping all four of them would be
convicted,'' he said, ``but they never expected it to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, up and down the commercial corridors of Flatbush, many
people said that while Volpe and Schwarz might have been the chief
malefactors, the other officers must have known, and perhaps aided,
in the torture of Louima in a bathroom at the 70th Precinct station
house, just blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you abuse somebody, you need punishment for that,'' a
neighborhood resident, France Frank, said as she stopped off to
talk with a friend selling bags of cinnamon and cloves on the
sidewalk. ``I'm not  &UR; angry &LR;  angry. I'm interested in justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Deslande Rincher, the owner of a Creole-language bookshop on
Church Avenue, reserved his dismay for the acquittal of Sgt.
Michael Bellomo, who was accused of covering up the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a supervisor, he is aware of what's going on,'' said
Rincher, 52, of Rosedale, Queens. ''You can call it partial
justice. Since the guy pleaded guilty _ Volpe _ we were under the
impression they were going to use his guilty plea to prove the
other guys did it, especially the sergeant and Schwarz.''
</P>
<P>
   But at a coin laundry down the street, where televisions blasted
cartoons rather than the news, Enlil El, 26, likened Bellomo's
plight to that of a parent held responsible for a child's
wrongdoing. It was the two other officers on trial, Thomas Bruder
and Thomas Wiese, who were accused of beating Louima in a police
car, who should have been convicted, he said. To him, the verdict
was unfair, but understandable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody's head had to roll,'' he said, referring to the two
officers, against whom he believed prosecutors had mounted the
strongest evidence. ``They could not let an acquittal go for the
whole party. You'd have a whole riot going on.''

AIDES SAY CHOICE IS NEAR FOR WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ White House officials said Tuesday that President
Clinton would most likely nominate Martin Baily, a partner at
McKinsey &AMP; Co., to succeed Janet Yellen later this year as head of
the Council of Economic Advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they hoped to move swiftly to fill
the job, which is effectively that of the president's chief
economist. Ms. Yellen plans to leave this summer to return to
teaching at the University of California at Berkeley after having
served two years in the White House and three years before that as
a Federal Reserve governor.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they had asked Ms. Yellen to consider returning
to the Fed to replace Alice Rivlin, the central bank's vice
chairwoman, who said last week that she would resign, effective
next month. But they said Ms. Yellen was intent on joining her
husband, George Akerlof, who is also a prominent economist, in
returning to their home and teaching jobs in California.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials had said on Monday that Ms. Yellen
intended to resign. In formally announcing her decision Tuesday
night, Clinton said in a statement that her ``extraordinary
intellect and keen grasp of domestic and international economics''
had contributed to a wide range of administration initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   The Council of Economic Advisers has had widely varying degrees
of influence in different administrations, and under Clinton has
taken a backseat to the National Economic Council, which
coordinates policy-making across Cabinet departments and agencies.
Ms. Yellen was the third person to hold the post under Clinton,
following Laura D'Andrea Tyson and Joseph Stiglitz.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said there had not been a final
decision on nominating Baily, who served as one of the three
members of the Council of Economic Advisers in 1995 and 1996. But
they said he was very likely to get the post. Baily did not return
a phone call seeking comment.

ANALYSIS: JURORS ACCEPT ONLY SOME OF OF LOUIMA ALLEGATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (with LOUIMA-TRIAL, LOUIMA-REACT)  
 (bl)  
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two weeks ago, when Officer Justin Volpe pleaded
guilty to putting a stick into Abner Louima's rectum, prosecutors
believed they had been given what they needed to convict other
police officers accused of violating Louima's civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe's plea dramatically bolstered Louima's credibility as a
victim of police brutality, and so prosecutors devoted much of
their closing arguments to a detailed retelling of Volpe's assault
in the bathroom of a Brooklyn station house. ``It shows that Abner
Louima was telling the truth,'' Alan Vinegrad, an assistant U.S.
attorney, told jurors last week.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors thought Louima's credibility would extend beyond the
bathroom, that jurors would accept his account of how Volpe and
three other officers beat him before he arrived at the station
house.
</P>
<P>
   They thought wrong.
</P>
<P>
   By their verdict Tuesday, jurors demonstrated their
unwillingness to take Louima at his word _ even knowing that his
most chilling tale of police brutality was no longer in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   While convicting Officer Charles Schwarz of restraining Louima
during the bathroom assault, jurors exonerated Schwarz and two
other officers _ Thomas Wiese and Thomas Bruder _ of assaulting
Louima in a police car on the way to the 70th Precinct station
house.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Zachary Carter said the verdict underscored what
prosecutors have long feared about police misconduct cases: that it
is ``historically difficult'' to win convictions ``where the only
witnesses to the assault are the victims themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   It was significant, he said, that jurors returned guilty
verdicts only where Louima's testimony was supported by the
testimony of other police officers from the 70th Precinct.
</P>
<P>
   Four officers gave damaging testimony against Volpe, describing
how he boasted of ``breaking'' a man and how he brandished the
feces-covered stick throughout the precinct house. Two of those
same four officers also testified that they saw Schwarz lead Louima
toward the bathroom just before the assault.
</P>
<P>
   But not a single officer backed Louima's account of being beaten
in a squad car, and Carter suggested that more must be done to
change ``the belief system'' of officers who, he said, think that
testifying against another officer _ violating the blue wall of
silence _ is the ultimate act of disloyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers for Wiese and Bruder drew entirely different
lessons from the verdict. They said it showed that jurors saw what
they had argued for weeks: that Louima, the victim of a singular
act of depravity, then inflated his allegations to implicate as
many officers as possible, thereby drawing attention and support
from those who believe the Police Department fosters a culture of
brutality.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, though, Tuesday's verdict failed to vindicate either
of the two great themes that clashed throughout the four-week
trial: was Abner Louima the victim of a sick police culture, or
merely of one sick police officer?
</P>
<P>
   For years, these questions have been central to the debate about
the New York Police Department, and they surfaced again from the
moment Louima first recounted the attack he endured on Aug. 9,
1997, after a night of dancing in a Brooklyn nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people marched on City Hall, claiming Louima as the
latest victim of an out-of-control Police Department. At the same
time, Police Commissioner Howard Safir called the assault an
aberration, and he said it was a ``myth'' that abusive officers
were protected by a wall of silence.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the trial, these same two arguments were repeated by
prosecutors and defense lawyers, so much so that at times the
arguments seemed like echoes of past public forums on the Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if one were to flip through the 1994 Mollen Commission
report on corruption in the New York Police Department, one would
find each of the major points stressed by the prosecutors in the
Louima case.
</P>
<P>
   The Mollen Commission found that officers frequently used
unnecessary force ``to administer what they believed was street
justice'' and then covered up their brutality by falsely charging
victims with resisting arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Vinegrad told jurors that Louima was the victim of ``street
justice,'' and he said the officers ``trumped up'' phony charges of
resisting arrest against Louima.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, defense lawyers called Louima the victim of a single
officer acting out his ``sick rage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This case has been tried to be made into this culture of
police brutality, and it never was,'' Stephen Worth, a lawyer for
Schwarz, told jurors.

 MEXICO CITY: available here. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The slowing growth is bringing Mexico good news of another kind.
In 1970, for every 100 Mexican workers there were 100 dependents,
mostly children and a few retired people. As the children have
grown up and entered the work force, this ``dependency ratio'' has
declined, to about 60 dependents for each 100 workers. By the year
2020, the burden of non-working dependents should decline still
further, to about 40 per 100 workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a moment in the evolution of populations when they
have the absolute best structure for development, and that's the
structure Mexico is developing right now,'' said Eduardo Arriaga,
an Argentine demographer who is a lecturer at Georgetown
University.
</P>
<P>
   This demographic bonus gives Mexico the opportunity to increase
domestic savings and with sensible economic management, could
result in higher per-capita economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The bonus phase of Mexico's demographic transition is expected
to last for 30 years. By then, the population will be, on average,
far older than it is today, and millions of Mexicans will need
retirement care.
</P>
<P>
   The costs of caring for the elderly will be higher, because most
retired Mexicans now live with their children. But because the
characteristically large Mexican family is shrinking, increasing
numbers of Mexicans live alone, and in the future the elderly may
not be able to count on home care provided by their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mexican family is being transformed in crucial ways,''
said Carlos Welti, a demographer at Mexico's National Autonomous
University. ``Throughout our history, an important social safety
network has been the extended family, uncles, cousins. In the
future, fewer will have these relationships.''

WNBA PLAYERS LEARN THAT LABOR STRESS IS GENDER BLIND 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By LENA WILLIAMS and JUDY BATTISTA    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The players union of the Women's National Basketball Association
overwhelmingly ratified a labor contract last month, the first in
women's professional team sports in the United States. The players
won increased salaries, year-round health coverage, including
maternity leave, a matching 401(k) program and limited job security
for veterans.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the WNBA players agree that the process of insuring
labor peace and jobs for the next four years was a lot rougher than
they expected.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three months of bargaining revealed an inexperienced
union at odds with itself, its leadership and management, insecure
in the knowledge that it stood to lose as much as it might gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``As women basketball players, we weren't really experienced in
dealing with things like the union, the league and collective
bargaining,'' said the Houston Comets' Cynthia Cooper, the league's
two-time most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   But the union also faced an issue it could not control: 90
fellow pros were out of work because the rival American Basketball
League had folded in late December. As the WNBA prepared for its
third season, the pros no longer had the option of playing in
another American league.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no bargaining power,'' said Rebecca Lobo, the Liberty
forward and a member of the negotiating committee. ``As soon as the
ABL folded, we had no leverage. ``We went in there and just tried
to get the best thing we could get. And I think we did a good
job.''
</P>
<P>
   The union wanted to limit the number of ABL players allowed into
the WNBA, while the league wanted no restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was extremely difficult because we had to continually
justify, not only to ourselves, but to our friends in the ABL and
the public, the general position that we took,'' said Coquese
Washington, the Liberty forward who emerged as one of the most
vocal player representatives. ``As a union that organized before
the ABL folded, we had a constituency that had issues to be met,
and job security was an issue before the ABL went under.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the WNBA expansion teams in Orlando and Minnesota
were allowed to have five ABL players each. The other 10 WNBA teams
were limited to three each, either as draftees or free agents.
After this season, there will be no limit on signing ABL players
and in 2000 four more teams will join the league, creating an
additional 44 jobs for players.
</P>
<P>
   Other bumps in the negotiations were predictable once the women
voted last November to align themselves with the National
Basketball Players Association. By the time the women started
negotiating their contract with the league, the NBPA had just ended
its contentious labor dispute with the National Basketball
Association, which owns and operates the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feared being shut down all together and alienating fans of
the league,'' said Lisa Leslie, the star center for the Los Angeles
Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   Given the tangential concerns _ plus the players' labor
inexperience _ their mistakes were inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are new at collective bargaining always make
mistakes,'' said Richard Hurd, professor of labor studies at
Cornell University. ``If you're negotiating an established
contract, then you go over every word and see if you can improve
it. With a first agreement, things slip by.''
</P>
<P>
   The union, for example, did not raise the issue of how players
from the ABL would be classified upon joining the league. Union
leaders assumed the players would be considered veterans, which
would entitle them to be paid at a higher scale. The league viewed
them as rookies.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute was one of a handful of issues that on April 22 led
to the collapse of an agreement in principle reached between the
league and the union eight days earlier. What happened next caught
the union off guard: the league issued a news release accusing the
union of reneging on key terms of the agreement and making new
economic demands. It also postponed the April 27 draft.
</P>
<P>
   When the WNBA made those announcements, the union's top three
officials were out of town. Some of the players learned of the
developments in news reports.
</P>
<P>
   A small but vocal group of players made it clear to the
negotiating committee that they weren't prepared to walk out over a
few lingering contract demands. Among the issues was a league
stipulation that players would not be allowed to play for the
season if they had not signed a contract by May 14, the start of
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the draft was canceled, that really caught my eye,'' said
Nikki McCray, a guard for the Washington Mystics. ``That's when
everybody just got together and said, `Look, what's at the table
right now is not worth us losing our season.' We didn't want to
start the season with negative energy from our fans.''
</P>
<P>
   The players said they were hearing one thing from the union, and
reading another from management.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never knew which side to listen to,'' said Rhonda Blades,
who plays for the Mystics. ``I would listen to the conference
calls, but it was hard to know who to trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Some players also had a hard time trusting the union leader they
inherited: Billy Hunter, the head of the NBPA, who played an
integral role in organizing the women but was better known for his
role in the NBA lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was seen, or at least, I was characterized as being somewhat
of an impediment to the negotiations,'' said Hunter, who
participated in only a half-dozen negotiating sessions. ``I felt it
was incumbent on my part, and probably in the best interest of the
women, to remove myself from the scene. So while I was involved, I
just wasn't out front.''
</P>
<P>
   But his conspicuous absence led to accusations, from some
players and advocates of women's pro sports, that he was neglecting
the women.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said he was briefed on everything that took place. By the
time he appointed Pamela M. Wheeler as director of operations for
the WNBA players association on March 30, most of the groundwork
for the contract was already in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important to the women to have a woman there,'' Hunter
said about Wheeler during the final stages of negotiations, which
also involved Valerie B. Ackerman, the WNBA's commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't operating in a vacuum,'' Wheeler said. ``I was armed,
not only with the necessary tools from Billy, but his confidence in
my ability to help arrive at a bargaining agreement. We also had
extremely competent attorneys from the NBPA''
</P>
<P>
   Yet others were disappointed in the players' decision to accept
the men's union. The Women's Coaches Association, which has 4,500
members in the collegiate and professional ranks, felt it could do
more to champion the needs and concerns of the women of the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not up on the personalities of women's basketball,
the coaches, the players, not just the athletes but the movers and
shakers of the game,'' Beth Bass, executive director of the Women's
Basketball Coaches Association, said about the men's union. ``This
is the very thing our association was worried about. You get people
involved that don't understand the history of game, and especially
the women's game. The men's game is different from the women,
especially in development.''
</P>
<P>
   And as a new union, the women were completely dependent upon the
men of the NBA for funding and staff. The women didn't have the
luxury of holding out with the men footing the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the logistics of briefing 132 athletes, some playing
overseas, and facing a deadline imposed by a season timed to the
NBA's off season, the union said it was proud reaching an agreement
in less than four months and walking away with something to please
most, if not all.
</P>
<P>
   Next time around, however, the players hope to do things
differently.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Lobo would like to get rid of some of the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have six or seven lawyers on each side involved,''
Lobo said, ``you're in for a lot of, `What does this word mean?'
The negotiations would have been good, if you had a player, who
really had a good handle on things, a bright attorney with Val and
a bright attorney with the union.''
</P>
<P>
   Even better, Lobo suggested, would be a change in scenery.
</P>
<P>
   ``In three years, when we have to renegotiate, we should all go
out on a golf course and get the deal done,'' she said.
</P>

NEW HAMPSHIRE: OTHER STATES CHALLENGE FOR POSITION 
LOUISIANA: BOTH SIDES ENDORSE BUSH 
MINNESOTA: JESSE TO GO THE DISTANCE, AS GOVERNOR
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.H., Del., Mich., S.C. La., Texas., Kan., Ariz., Idaho,
Mont., Nev., N.M., Minn.)  (jw) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new War Between the States _ the competition to schedule the
first Election 2000 primary or caucus _ is escalating.
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire House will take up a bill today that, if it
becomes law, will allow the Granite State to hold its primary as
early as December of this year.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire has held the first primary for decades, of course,
by tradition and, for that matter, by law. A state statute requires
that New Hampshirites must vote first, by at least a week.
</P>
<P>
   And for years New Hampshirites did vote first, usually around
Feb. 1, give or take a week or two.
</P>
<P>
   Then along came Delaware, wanting some of the political glory
for itself. It adopted a rule that says its primary must fall four
days after the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   The war was on, and continues with no end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts by national party officials to stop it, either through
mediation or threats of sanctions, have gone nowhere. In fact, the
war is spreading as more and more states advance their primary and
caucus dates in an effort to grab political attention and
influence.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, Michigan moved its Republican primary date up to
Feb. 22, from March 21, a shift meant to put the state among the
first half a dozen or so to vote. Not to be outdone, South Carolina
Republicans then decided over the weekend to advance their primary
date by a week, to Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolinians figure that unless things change _ and
they very well may _ the new date will make their primary the third
``meaningful'' contest in Election 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will open it up and we'll be the focus of attention
again,'' Henry McMaster, the chairman of the South Carolina
Republican Party, said after the weekend vote. ``This ensures that
South Carolina will remain the make-or-break state in our
presidential nominating process.''
</P>
<P>
   The first ``meaningful'' contest, if tradition holds, will be
the Iowa caucuses, now scheduled for Feb. 7. For decades they have
been the first of the first, taking place a week before even the
New Hampshire primary, the second ``meaningful'' contest.
</P>
<P>
   But just as Delaware threatens New Hampshire claim to the first
primary, so Louisiana is challenging Iowa's right to hold the first
caucuses. Louisiana Republicans recently passed a resolution that
says their party will caucus first, no matter what Iowa's caucus
date.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner says he favors a
Feb. 14 primary for his state, one that would follow Iowa's
caucuses by the traditional week. He insists he does not want to
call a December primary in order to maintain New Hampshire's
decades-old position in the nominating process.
</P>
<P>
   But if Delaware election officials persist with their
four-days-later plan, he warns, he will, with legislative approval,
try to thwart them by scheduling New Hampshire's primary on Dec.
21.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think they would like to have their primary on Christmas
Day?'' he mused the other day, not entirely in jest.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he continues to pressure White House hopefuls to
forgo any campaigning in Delaware, lest New Hampshire voters punish
them for breaking with tradition. And he just might be making a bit
of headway, but don't bet on it yet.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the leading Republican hopefuls, Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas and Elizabeth Dole, the former Red Cross president, called
upon other states not to encroach on the New Hampshire primary,
while the author of Delaware's primary law, state Sen. Robert
Marshall, D-Wilmington, said on Monday that perhaps the four-day
period should be extended to the week of separation called for by
New Hampshire law.
</P>
<P>
   If we don't change the law, he said, ``then all the major party
candidates' stops won't include Delaware.''
</P>
<P>
   A footnote: When the rush to front-load the primary and caucus
calendar first began, some Western leaders dreamed of putting
together an eight-state regional primary that would give the
sparsely populated Rocky Mountain area more nominating clout than
ever before.
</P>
<P>
   It's not going to happen. Five states have now rejected the
proposal: Arizona, Idaho, Montana, Nevada and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Only three states have agreed to the proposal: Colorado, Utah
and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   BOTH SIDES ENDORSE BUSH IN LOUISIANA
</P>
<P>
   Whatever date Louisiana Republicans finally choose for their
presidential caucuses next spring, maybe they should let Democrats
join once the caucusing starts. Consider:
</P>
<P>
   Before last year's elections, the top Democratic and Republican
officeholders in the state who were up for re-election concocted a
pact. It stated, bluntly: No Democratic signatory would take part
in any effort to unseat a Republican signatory, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Given the flux in party politics in the South, Democrats often
act more like Republicans than Republicans themselves. But the
brassiness of that pact struck many members of both parties as a
bit much.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes more ideological muddling. The other day, 21 Democrats
in the Louisiana House of Representatives, including Speaker Hunt
Downer, joined 23 Republican legislators in endorsing Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas for president. In fact, they not only endorsed the
front-running Republican hopeful but also praised his ``high ideals
of integrity and ethics'' and offered ``enthusiastic support'' for
his election effort.
</P>
<P>
   That was too much for state Rep. Travis Holley, D-Bastrop. When
the Democratic State Central Committee met over the weekend, he
proposed that it adopt a resolution ending the party's
long-standing policy of routinely endorsing Democrats seeking
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be allowed to consider and act upon the request of
challengers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no vote. Holley could not find a quorum.

   MINNESOTA'S GOVERNOR TO SERVE A FULL TERM  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Jesse Ventura, running as the Reform Party candidate, was
elected governor of Minnesota last year, he gave the party a needed
lift. Not since its founder, Ross Perot, finished a surprising
strong third in the 1992 presidential race had any of its
candidates enjoyed such success.
</P>
<P>
   Now, says the governor, it is time to build on that success.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean he intends to run for president?
</P>
<P>
   No, he replied the other day, while on another cross-country
swing to promote his new book, ``I Ain't Got Time to Bleed''
(Villard). Rather, he said, he planned to serve his full four-year
term and, at the same time, work to strengthen his party.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to step forward as a leader,'' he said. ``You don't
have to be a candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he have a candidate in mind, say, Perot?
</P>
<P>
   Perot, he answered pointedly, should ``step aside'' and the
party should search for a fresh leader.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Ventura, he insisted, was not looking to be that leader.

DOCTOR TELLS OF CONCEALING BASKETBALL STAR'S AILMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Gilbert H. Mudge Jr., the doctor who announced to the
world in May 1993 that Reggie Lewis had a benign fainting disorder
that would not end his basketball career, testified Tuesday that he
had met with Lewis, Lewis's wife, hospital officials, and Boston
Celtics representatives and had agreed not to reveal that Lewis
might have a serious heart condition as well.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge's assertion that Lewis and those close to him had
concealed the full prognosis was made as the Brigham and Women's
Hospital cardiologist, who was in charge of Lewis's care, returned
to the witness stand to defend himself in the malpractice case
sparked by Lewis's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a very calculated plan . . . that we would present only
one diagnosis,'' Mudge said of the May 1993 press conference. ``I
remember being quite adamant about this . . . I did not want to
have to discuss or debate Mr. Lewis's medical care in a public
forum.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven weeks after Mudge confidently proclaimed that Lewis
didn't have a life-threatening heart condition, the 27-year-old
Celtics star died of heart failure while casually shooting baskets
at Brandeis University.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Mudge for the first time told jurors about the
conversation he had with Lewis two weeks before he died in which
Lewis reportedly admitted that he had used cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge said the confession took place in Lewis's car at a Celtics
rookie training camp in July 1993. Although he had asked Lewis on
three prior occasions if he had used cocaine, Mudge said he raised
the issue again because cocaine use was the only explanation for
the abnormalities he'd detected in Lewis's heart.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge said Lewis dodged the question twice that day, once by
making an unrelated comment and once by signing an autograph for a
child who had approached his car.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Mudge recalled, ``I said, `You still haven't answered
my question.' '' Then, Mudge said, ``He nodded his head and said
`yes' . . . I was actually not surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Mudge also recounted a phone conversation with Lewis's widow,
Donna Harris-Lewis, two months after Lewis died in which she said
that Reggie's mother had used cocaine and that he had been killed
by the same ``poison.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis has denied that her husband used drugs and has said
that Mudge's allegation that he had admitted using cocaine prompted
her to bring the malpractice suit.
</P>
<P>
   Despite misleading the public and the press about his full
diagnosis of Lewis's condition, Mudge on Tuesday insisted he had
not lied.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, doctor,'' asked Robert G. Harley, the attorney for
Harris-Lewis, ``you can be pretty convincing when you want to tell
a story, even though it's not the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing untrue I said in that press conference,''
answered Mudge, speaking more deliberately, and humbly, than he had
during his testimony last month.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge also testified that Lewis's belated confession to drug use
impeded his ability to make an accurate diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had had a clear indication of his use of cocaine . . . it
certainly would have changed our analyses of the tests,'' Mudge
said. ``By not knowing he was on cocaine, we deprived many
consultants who saw Mr. Lewis of, really, a better opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   And had he known about Lewis's drug use earlier, ``We certainly
would never have had a press conference,'' Mudge said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his daylong testimony, Mudge spoke kindly of the
Lewises, noting that he sympathized with the ``intense and
unrelenting interest by the press in (Lewis's) medical care.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Lewis's ``gentle demeanor'' and ``quiet nature,''
he called the player ``an individual who I can relate to.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked by his attorney to describe his impression of
Harris-Lewis, Mudge said he found her to be ``very caring, very
intelligent . . . she had a very impressive command of the medical
issues we were confronting.''
</P>
<P>
   Mudge also spoke of the complexity of Lewis's case, noting that
the player often experienced physical symptoms that were not
accompanied by abnormal heart readings, and abnormal heart readings
not accompanied by symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was puzzled . . . I didn't fully understand what was
happening,'' Mudge said.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge also said he and the Lewises had an understanding that
Reggie was not to exercise unless he was monitored. He said that
when Harris-Lewis told him that her husband wanted to begin
shooting baskets after his discharge, ``I said that was
unacceptable to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mudge also testified that in the September following Lewis's
death, Harris-Lewis telephoned him to discuss her dismay with
continuing press coverage of the case. During that phone call,
Mudge said, Harris-Lewis ``indicated to me that Mr. Lewis's mother
had a problem with cocaine and that in fact Mr. Lewis had died from
the poisons his mother had given to him.''

CONVICTED OFFICER HAD CAREER OF HIGHS AND LOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With LOUIMA-TRIAL and LOUIMA-REACT) 
(mk) 
 By VIVIAN S. TOY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The police career of Charles Schwarz, the 33-year-old
officer convicted Tuesday of holding down Abner Louima while Justin
Volpe shoved a stick into his rectum, was one of extreme highs and
lows.
</P>
<P>
   In 10 years as a transit officer and a police officer, he
distinguished himself among his peers, receiving 11 medals for
meritorious and excellent police duty.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1992, while still on probation after transferring to the
Police Department from the Transit Police, he was suspended for 15
days after the department found him guilty of brutality for
punching someone in the face while he was off duty.
</P>
<P>
   When Schwarz was first indicted in the Louima case in 1997,
Police Commissioner Howard Safir told reporters that the officer
should have been dismissed after the 1992 brutality incident.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz was also the subject of three complaints to the Civilian
Complaint Review Board: excessive force, ethnic slurs and cursing.
All three charges stemmed from the same incident and all were ruled
unsubstantiated for lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz joined the Transit Police in 1989 and, after moving to
the Police Department in 1991, worked mostly at the 70th Precinct
in Brooklyn. He spent two years working in plainclothes for the
Anti-Crime unit.

   Schwarz lives in the borough of Staten Island with his wife,
Andra, near his mother and younger brother. Friends said he spent a
great deal of spare time helping his brother, who was paralyzed
when he dove into a pool in 1996. A former Marine who was also in
the Coast Guard reserves, Schwarz is an avid sports fan who played
on the 70th Precinct softball team.
</P>
<P>
   Now, having been convicted of involvement in the sexual assault
of Louima, Schwarz faces a maximum of life in prison without
parole. He is expected to appeal.

POLICE HOPE LOUIMA VERDICT WILL LIFT CLOUD OVER DEPARTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (with LOUIMA-TRIAL, LOUIMA-ASSESS, LOUIMA-REACT)  
 (bl)  
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the police officers who walk beats and patrol in
radio cars here, there was some hope Tuesday that the verdicts in
the Abner Louima brutality trial would mark the beginning of the
end of what many described as one of the ugliest episodes in the
Police Department's history.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since allegations first surfaced that an officer had used a
stick to sexually assault Louima in a station house bathroom, the
department has been under a cloud. Not only were there angry
rallies denouncing the department as brutal, but also, officers on
the beat were taunted day in and day out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would get comments when you went out on jobs,'' recalled
Sgt. Noel Leader, a member of 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who
Care, a police group. ``People would say, `Don't sodomize me' or,
`What are you going to do, sodomize me like Louima?' It only made
our job that much more difficult, and it dented the reputation of
the NYPD both nationally and internationally.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most difficult police assignments since the attack on
Louima was given to Inspector Raymond Diaz, who became the new
commander of the 70th Precinct in Flatbush, Brooklyn, where the
attack occurred. He was given a mandate to improve relations
between the police and the public and to improve morale in the
station house.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, at the conclusion of a federal civil rights trial that
resulted in the convictions of two police officers in the August
1997 attack and the acquittals of three others, Diaz said he hoped
that the verdicts would help people in the neighborhood put the
incident behind them. ``It's good that we get to see some
closure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a community of immigrants, and many people who come
here start out feeling fearful of the police, and now we have
something like this happen and it sets us back,'' he said. ``It's
going to take a lot of work to show these people that this is not
what the NYPD is all about, that it was a terrible aberration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole point is to show people that we're here for them for
reducing crime, improving their quality of life, solving their
problems, and that we're not the enemy and we don't see them as the
enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Officer Pamela Rinando, a 17-year department veteran who works
in the 48th Precinct in the Fordham section of the Bronx, said she
hoped that the incident would lead officials to try to change how
the department deals with the public and how it handles its own
officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to start healing at this point,'' she said. ``We have
to start building a bridge between us and the community. We have to
start evaluating what's going on. We have to start looking at the
human factors. And instead of looking to hang police officers all
the time, we should start looking at why these horrible things are
happening. If a cop has a problem, he should be able to go for
psychological help without a stigma.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Donald Jirak, president of the Gay Officers Action League,
said he hoped that the verdicts would encourage the department to
take further steps to protect police officers who come forward to
report misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   At the 70th Precinct station house Tuesday, Diaz said that while
there was a sense of relief that the main federal trial had ended,
officers were aware that there could still be another trial on
lesser charges and a civil trial. But he said he hoped that the
officers under his command would continue to win back the trust of
the people they are sworn to protect and serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relationship has really been strengthened,'' he said.

SOME CALLS RING TRUE; OTHERS PHONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the worst things you can do to an NBA general manager is
to take away his cell phone. Especially in June. Take the thing
away in April and the guy might offer you two courtside tickets.
Take it in June and the conversation may escalate to a heated, ``I
think we need to step outside and settle this.''
</P>
<P>
   You want to know the NBA's version of a Pavlovian experiment?
Show a tight-lipped GM a calendar already flipped to June and I
guarantee he will suddenly open his mouth. There are no quiet GMs
and Trade Makers in June. That's because this is their Month of
Atonement. They are on their cellulars constantly, talking about
trades they are sorry to have made; trades they are sorry not to
have made; trades they could make that would no longer make them
sorry; and trades they actually made before they were rejected by
that sorry owner.
</P>
<P>
   I did mention the worst thing you can do to a GM this month,
right? Well, this is the worst way to begin a sentence when using
that cell phone to call Rick Pitino and Chris Wallace: ``Hello, I
wanted to talk to you guys about the availability of Paul Pierce .
. .'' Start off like that and you'll hear all this static on the
other end. Nothing is wrong with the phone. Somebody simply hung up
on you.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're basically telling people that he is an untouchable,''
said Pitino, the Celtics president and coach, Tuesday. ``I mean, if
Detroit calls and says they want to trade Grant Hill for Paul, we
might have to talk. But, basically, he's not available.''
</P>
<P>
   He shouldn't be available. Do you realize that Pierce _ not Dana
Barros _ was the team's most accurate 3-point shooter last season?
Most rookies struggle to make open 20-footers. But Pierce made 41
percent of his shots from nearly 23 feet and beyond. No one is
saying that Pierce will become the next Reggie Miller, but even
Miller managed only 35 percent shooting from 3-point range his
rookie year.
</P>
<P>
   Smart GMs know the Celtics don't want to discuss dealing Pierce.
But they also know that mentioning Ron Mercer's name will certainly
not end a conversation. It's been that way since Mercer's rookie
year. Why is that?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's because of his contract,'' Pitino said. ``He has a
reasonable contract. It's going to be unreasonable soon, but right
now it's not. If he had five years left on his contract, you
wouldn't hear his name mentioned so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Duncan also has a reasonable contract, but everyone knows
not to call San Antonio asking about a trade. The talk about Mercer
may have some contract elements, but it goes beyond that. His name
was volleyed about in trade talk during his rookie year, during the
offseason between his rookie year and second year, during his
second year and now.
</P>
<P>
   One rumor, which was quickly dismissed, had Mercer and Kenny
Anderson going to Orlando for Penny Hardaway. A recent one involves
the Raptors, draft picks . . . and Mercer. ``Totally untrue,''
Pitino says. ``We haven't had any discussions with the Raptors.
None. Not even a hint of truth there.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe no one has talked with the Raptors about Mercer, but they
have talked about him to some team. Or teams. You can call this
kind of talk ``trade rumors'' after the first four or five stories,
but at some point you've got to call it what it really is: the
inevitable. I think all the cell phone talk about Mercer will
eventually result in Mercer playing somewhere else next season. And
when that happens, Anderson probably won't be joining him in that
new city. A lot of fans would like the point guard to go, but his
home city during the season will likely be Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm fine,'' Anderson said Tuesday from his home in
Atlanta. ``I can't get caught up in the trade rumors. Two of my
best friends live in Boston. They called me up and were like, `Oh,
man. You're going to be leaving us.' But I think Coach is happy
with me. I think his system is perfect for me. I love the situation
I'm in right now.''
</P>
<P>
   He's in a situation that many of us would love. He has four
years left on his contract and is owed $31 million. Combine those
numbers with the meager ones Anderson put on the court and you'll
understand why Pitino said, ``The chances of him being traded are
slim and nil.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson will be in town next week to work out with Celtics
strength coach Shaun Brown. After that, the point guard said he
will hire a track coach to help him with his speed and
conditioning. When Pitino heard that, he cracked, ``Who's he going
to hire to run for him?''
</P>
<P>
   The coach may be bluffing, but he says he doesn't believe
Anderson is the problem with the Celtics. ``I still trust his
ability,'' Pitino said. ``What I don't trust is his durability.''
</P>
<P>
   As you might expect, Anderson also doesn't think he is the
problem with the Celtics. Last month, 76ers coach Larry Brown said
the problem in Boston is that the Celtics ``have five guys who all
want to score.'' Pitino agreed with that. So did Anderson. The
point guard also said he had no problem sacrificing his scoring and
setting up the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know who the scorers on our team should be,'' he said.
``They should be Antoine Walker and Paul Pierce. We all need to
accept that. There's too much talent on our team for us not to be
in the playoffs. Even my mother noticed that last year. She watched
us and said, `You all play like you don't want to pass the ball.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Every Celtic should now realize the obvious. Somebody is not
going to return next season. Walker will probably be back. ``If he
averaged 16 points, 12 rebounds, and 6 assists,'' Pitino said, ``he
would be a top three MVP candidate every year.'' Pierce will be
back. Anderson may, too.
</P>
<P>
   But many times this summer, GMs from around the country will
call Wallace and Pitino on their cell phones. They will ask about
Mercer. They will not be disconnected.

LOUIMA LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARE FAR FROM OVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (with LOUIMA-TRIAL, LOUIMA-ASSESS, LOUIMA-POLICE, LOUIMA-REACT)  
 (bl)  
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The verdicts issued Tuesday involving four police
officers in the Abner Louima brutality case did not end the legal
proceedings against those acquitted in the trial or against the
Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the acquitted officers, Thomas Bruder and Thomas Wiese,
still face a charge that they conspired with Officer Charles
Schwarz to keep investigators from concluding that Schwarz had
participated in the torture of Louima. Schwarz was the only officer
convicted Tuesday, as a U.S. District Court jury in Brooklyn found
that he helped Officer Justin Volpe torture Louima by holding him
down during an attack in a restroom of the 70th Precinct station
house.
</P>
<P>
   After the verdicts were announced, Zachary Carter, the U.S.
attorney in Brooklyn, said his office would now try Schwarz, Bruder
and Wiese on a charge of conspiring to obstruct justice.
</P>
<P>
   Bruder and Wiese were acquitted of charges that they beat Louima
in a police car before he arrived at the station house. The lawyers
for those two officers said they hoped now that Carter would not
pursue the obstruction charge against their clients, but said they
if the prosecutor did, ``We'll fight that one, too,'' in the words
of Joseph Tacopina, Wiese's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Police Department itself is undergoing scrutiny
from prosecutors. Carter's office has been conducting an inquiry
into whether the Police Department's conduct in the Louima case and
in related matters reflects a broader, institutional pattern of
police brutality. If he finds that to be the case, he may seek an
agreement under which the department would make changes, or, if
unable to reach an agreement, he could sue the department.
</P>
<P>
   The department plans administrative trials that could result in
the dismissal of Bruder, Wiese and the third defendant acquitted
Tuesday, Sgt. Michael Bellomo.
</P>
<P>
   The jury's finding that their actions did not violate the
criminal laws does not mean that they did not violate department
policies and regulations in dealing with Louima or Patrick Antoine,
a second man assaulted by Volpe.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe was dismissed from the force when he pleaded guilty, and
Schwarz was dismissed upon conviction Tuesday, said lawyers in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Police Department trials are also to be held for about a
half-dozen more police officers whom police officials have accused
of lying to investigators about what they saw or knew about the
treatment of Louima and Antoine.
</P>
<P>
   They include Officer Michael Schoer, who testified as a key
prosecution witness against Volpe at the trial. He said Volpe had
shown him the stick with which he later admitted attacking Louima,
but Schoer admitted on the stand that at first he had not told
investigators about the stick. The inconsistency has led to the
departmental charges of lying against him.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Louima has filed a civil suit in which all the officers
who had been charged in the criminal case are among the defendants,
along with the city.

 Enterprising Kids Go Beyond Lemonade Stand  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Summer vacation is at hand for the K-12 crowd, or will be soon.
That means more time to snooze, socialize and _ for an increasing
number of kids _ start a business.
<P>
   With more online connections and experience than many of their
parents, students increasingly are doing more than selling
lemonade, washing cars and weeding neighbors' gardens. Some, for
example, are setting up computer training and consulting practices.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Success for these budding entrepreneurs often hinges more on
passion and investment of time than money. Creating a business also
requires a streak of creativity and independence. And age certainly
isn't a consideration since some local preteenagers have created
successful enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   However, kids are not simply born inventors or entrepreneurs. It
helps to get the support, both personal and financial, of parents
or a mentoring organization.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  With increasing publicity about high-tech success stories and
the proliferation of entrepreneurship training programs, (See &LR; 
story page tk),  &LR; more kids are getting bitten by the business bug.
David Schincariol, author of ``Start and Run a Profitable
Student-Run Business'' (Self-Counsel Press, $12.95), estimates that
one in four students becomes an entrepreneur while in school.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In fact, many decide to continue their summer business
endeavors into the school year and after graduation.
</P>
<P>
   For example, take Tom Whitnah, who graduates next week from
Menlo-Atherton High School. He started playing with his dad's Radio
Shack computer when he was 2 years old. In elementary school, he
offered free advice to other kids. Then he graduated to
volunteering his computer-training services at the San Carlos
Senior Center &UR;  &LR; and his high school, where he helped create a
2,000-page Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Through referrals, Tom &UR;  &LR; landed his first paying customers and
set up his own consulting business two years ago. First, he tutored
senior citizens and others on how to use PCs and online services
and charged $15 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Whitnah then reinvested some of the revenues to pick up 3-D
graphic design and other skills as he shifted the focus of his
Vision Net Consulting business ( &LR; www.thevisionnet.com &LR; ) to Web site
and other services for businesses. Whitnah found that shift not
only more interesting but it also allowed him to easily raise his
hourly fee to $20.
</P>
<P>
   His main client is now an Atherton startup called SurfWax, where
Whitnah works about 12 hours a week, helping to create a new type
of Internet search engine.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, when he starts studying computer science at Stanford
University and will be one of about 200 freshman to receive a
$3,000 intellectual exploration grant, Whitnah plans to cut back
his consulting business but raise his hourly rates to $25 or $30.
</P>
<P>
   His advice to would-be entrepreneurs is to ``first get into
something you love, even if you do it for free.'' Next, ``get to
know your market and the type of services they are looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, computer expertise is easier to sell these days than,
say, soccers skills, Whitnah acknowledges. But students who excel
in sports or music can also join programs or camps to help train
younger kids. Whitnah adds that the best marketing is word of
mouth. He has relied entirely on positive client referrals to build
his business and now has more work than he can handle.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it helps to have good connections and positive role
models at home. Whitnah's dad is a computer aficionado and heads
the math department at Menlo-Atherton; his mother is a career
guidance assistant at Redwood High School.
</P>
<P>
   Whitnah also took advantage of training programs. Last summer,
he signed up for a free two-week BizCamp at Stanford University
sponsored by the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship
and this year won a $1,000 entrepreneurship award from the New York
nonprofit organization.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the kids who take NFTE's programs in school or summer
camp are less privileged than Whitnah. One of its graduates and
another award winner this year is Ricardo Garcia, who dropped out
of George Washington High School in San Francisco four years ago
after skipping most of his junior year classes.
</P>
<P>
   But he took NFTE's business lessons to heart and later attended
Heald Business College and Renaissance Entrepreneurship Center and
established a Latino rap and hip-hop magazine. Now 20 and executive
editor of Info-magazine, Garcia echoes Whitnah's advice to pursue
one's interests. Last December, he also became an instructor for
NFTE.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferycq &LR;  Toney, 18, who graduates next Wednesday from
Castlemont High School in Oakland, also is tuning in to a music
career. Last year, he made about $10,000 giving rap concerts and
selling his ``Skyballin''' CD, which he cut with his friend Cameron
Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Toney has plowed much of the money back into music equipment and
in September will study music and the music business at Columbia
College in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can teach you how to be an artist,'' said Toney, who
hopes one day to create his recording label. ``But it's not just
about music. You have to keep your head in the books and know the
business part.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Mehrad Noori, 15, who will be a junior at California High
School in San Ramon next year, stumbled on a business idea while
playing on his computer.
</P>
<P>
   Using Adobe Illustrator software, he designed logos that look
like traffic signs but with different wording. For instance, he has
come up with a stop sign that says ``Think,'' a yield sign that
says ``Chill,'' and a one-way sign that says ``My way.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehrad's older brother showed the designs to a friend who runs a
snowboard and skate shop and who was enthusiastic about potential
consumer response to caps or T-shirts bearing the logos.
</P>
<P>
   Mehrad's father, who is in the construction business and once
taught economics at the University of California at Santa Barbara,
put up about $7,000 to have the first 1,200 caps manufactured at a
San Diego plant.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Mehrad is talking with a lawyer about trademark protection. He
also is registering the name Civilian Ltd. and setting up a Web
site along with the business.
</P>
<P>
   The local kid entrepreneur who has gained perhaps the most fame
and fortune recently is toy designer Rich Stachowski of Contra
Costa County. He came up with an idea for an underwater talking
device when snorkeling with his dad on Maui nearly three years ago
at the age of 11.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, about 200,000 Water Talkies have been sold. Scuba
Scope and Pool Pogo Stick also are on the market and Stachowski,
who will be 14 next month, has several other products under
development.
</P>
<P>
   It helps to have entrepreneurial role models. Stachowski's
mother has 86 inventions to her credit, the latest of which is a
newfangled hair clip that sells on the QVC cable channel.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Stachowski has learned some important lessons about
the business world, like being discriminating about disclosing
information. Asked about reports that he sold his business Short
Stack to San Francisco's Wild Planet in February for $1 million or
more, he said, ``I don't talk about finances.''
</P>
<P>
   To be a successful entrepreneur, he recommends using your
imagination, brainstorming, making lots of prototypes and
surrounding ``yourself with people who can do things you can't and
learn from them.''
</P>
<P>
   Stachowski has won several young entrepreneur and inventor of
the year awards and also serves on the board of directors of
BizWorld in Redwood City. Venture capitalist Tim Draper, of the
firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson, got the inspiration to set up
BizWorld as a nonprofit organization to teach kids about
entrepreneurship when his daughter was in the third grade and asked
him, ``What do you do when you're away?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; For kids who prefer to work for someone else before they start
their own enterprises, there are various programs. For instance,
Enterprise for High School Students places more than 2,000
teenagers in San Francisco jobs each year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; There's also the San Francisco School-to-Career Partnership, a
joint venture of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, the mayor's
office, school district and city college, which hopes to place 500
students in paid internships this summer.

 _ SF CHRON   Post-VCR Companies Get Backing 
 &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Two Silicon Valley startups that have just launched competing VCR
replacements have won votes of confidence from major players in
broadcasting and consumer electronics.
<P>
   Replay Networks of Mountain View announced yesterday that
Matsushita, the Japanese giant behind the Panasonic brand name,
will begin manufacturing digital recording devices based on
Replay's technology later this year, in time for the holiday
shopping season.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, TiVo, Replay's archrival, and NBC are slated to
announce a strategic partnership today. The broadcast giant will
make a ``significant'' investment in the Sunnyvale company, and Tom
Rogers, executive vice president of NBC and president of its cable
subsidiary, will join TiVo's board.
</P>
<P>
   Both TiVo and Replay have developed set-top boxes that convert
TV programming into digital format and record it on computer-style
hard drives. Users who are watching a program and get interrupted
by a phone call can hit the pause button and start recording. When
they come back, they can pick up watching where they left off while
continuing to record the rest of the show.
</P>
<P>
   Both Replay and TiVo launched their products this spring, but so
far, they've been available only from the companies' Web sites, and
only in limited quantity.
</P>
<P>
   Replay currently makes and markets its set-top box under its own
name, but the deal with Panasonic will give it much wider
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; TiVo's are built by Philips Electronics, which is scheduled to
begin offering it in retail stores next month.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for both products start at about $700, including lifetime
access to program listings, which the devices download by modem
every night. As users are surfing through the TV listings and see a
program they like, all they have to do is click on it and it will
be recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Replay said pricing for the Panasonic versions haven't been set.
</P>
<P>
   TiVo and NBC officials refused to disclose details of the
network's investment. DirecTV, the Hughes Electronics subsidiary
that delivers digital TV programming through satellite receivers,
is TiVo's largest corporate investor, after taking a stake of more
than 10 percent in April. Other investors include Philips, Showtime
Networks and several venture capital funds.
</P>
<P>
   For NBC, the TiVo investment is the latest in a flurry of recent
moves to reach beyond traditional broadcasting. In addition to
MSNBC, the TV and Internet news service it co-owns with Microsoft,
the company has invested in Cnet, Talk City, iVillage and several
other Internet properties. Together with Snap.com and Xoom.com,
it's in the process of forming a new company called NBC Internet
(NBCi), which plans to integrate broadcast, Web-portal and
e-commerce services.
</P>
<P>
   Peg Murphy, vice president of business development for NBC
Interactive, called today's deal ``not just a good financial
investment, but an incredible strategic partnership for NBC.''
</P>
<P>
   The partnership, she said, will ``allow us to package and
promote our properties in whole new ways.'' NBC will, for example,
produce special previews and promotional materials about its
miniseries and other programs to supplement the bare-bones listings
that TiVo currently delivers to subscribers' screens.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, Murphy said, ``someone might be watching a `Law
and Order' episode they've recorded on the hard drive, and we'll be
able to pop a promo for `Law and Order _ Special Victims Unit' (a
spin-off series the network will launch next fall) right on their
screen.'' Or fans of ``Saturday Night Live'' could be invited to
tune into an archive of old episodes already waiting on their hard
drives, complete with new ads.
</P>
<P>
   The deal won't prohibit TiVo from making similar arrangements
with other TV networks, nor will it keep NBC from marketing its
programming through Replay's service, according to officials from
the two companies. They also denied that NBC shows would get
favored treatment on the TiVo system, which provides subscribers
extensive materials and suggestions about upcoming programming.
</P>
<P>
   TiVo and NBC also plan to work with advertisers to develop
``targeted advertising'' based on users' viewing habits and
preferences. TiVo devices store such information and currently use
it to come up with entertainment suggestions, but company officials
say the data stays in the user's own machine and is not collected
in a central database, out of respect for customers' privacy.

 S.F. Ad Agencies McCann-Erickson, Anderson &AMP; Lembke to
Join  Forces 
 &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
McCann-Erickson San Francisco, known for the ``It's the Cheese''
commercials, is merging with tech specialist Anderson &AMP; Lembke to
form the city's fifth-largest advertising agency.
<P>
   Both companies, the seventh- and ninth-largest in the city,
respectively, are owned by McCann-Erickson North America, part of
the Interpublic Group of Cos., so no money or stock will change
hands.
</P>
<P>
   The new agency, with combined billings of $333.7 million, will
be called McCann-Erickson/A&AMP;L and headed by Nick Bishop, A&AMP;L's
president. He will become chief executive when the deal closes
August 1.
</P>
<P>
   The merger was precipitated by the companies' joint win last
month of Microsoft's Windows 2000 account, formerly held by Wieden
&AMP; Kennedy of Portland, Ore. Microsoft wanted A&AMP;L for the
business-to-business portion of the account; A&AMP;L's sister agency,
McCann, was brought in to pitch the consumer end.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the combination, we have everything all in one place,''
said Microsoft spokesman Rob Schoeben.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, to be announced today, is the latest example of a
consumer-product agency partnering with a tech specialist. Earlier
this year, the city's largest independent ad shop, Citron Haligman
Bedecarre, which creates ads for companies like Power Bar, was
acquired by New York tech agency Euro RSCG Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Many tech businesses are trying to boost their name recognition
beyond geek audiences, even as consumer-product companies begin to
market themselves online.
</P>
<P>
   By merging, ``we believe we will have the profile to ... move to
the very top of the agency business in San Francisco,'' said Don
Dillon, president of McCann-Erickson North America.
</P>
<P>
   Both McCann and A&AMP;L have experienced bumpy times in recent
years. McCann's billings dropped 25 percent, to $205 million, last
year after losing accounts including AT&AMP;T's wireless business.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;L, whose billings totaled $129 million in 1998, was in danger
of closing five years ago after an unsuccessful attempt to broaden
its tech focus. The company is healthy now but is dominated by a
single client, Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think by combining, they are hoping for the critical mass
they've never been able to achieve separately,'' said one agency
source on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Benza, the outgoing general manager of McCann, opted to quit
the company rather than transfer outside the Bay Area. Benza has
spent his entire 23-year career with McCann.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop, a 14-year McCann veteran who has run A&AMP;L only since
January, said layoffs are not expected and that in fact the agency
is recruiting new employees to staff the Microsoft account and a
new McCann account, Siebel Systems, with billings of $20 million to
$30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, A&AMP;L employs about 200 people and McCann has 140.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and its agencies refuse to disclose account sizes, but
trade magazines estimate Microsoft's total ad spending at $220
million domestically and $180 million internationally.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;L's Amsterdam and Hong Kong offices will not be affected by
the merger with McCann.

USC EYES WOMEN`S NATIONAL COACH HALEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC's search for a women's volleyball coach has
turned to U.S. women's national team coach Mick Haley, after UC
Irvine men's coach Charlie Brande turned down the job.
</P>
<P>
   Brande mulled an offer for several days before deciding over the
weekend that he would remain at Irvine, where he was named Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation Coach of the Year last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tremendous offer, but my family's here in Orange
County and I decided to stay home,'' Brande said. ``It was the
toughest decision I've made in my life. I thought it would be a
tremendous place to coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Brande, 51, received a raise from Irvine to remain as men's
coach. Another factor in his decision is the successful girls' club
program he runs in Newport Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``My love of coaching is for the club,'' Brande said.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Haley as USC's next choice. He has already visited
USC and formally interviewed for the job. Haley previously coached
at Texas, where he won national championships in 1981 and 1988.
Haley compiled a 522-137-1 record in 17 seasons at Texas and won 13
Southwest Conference titles.
</P>
<P>
   He will coach the U.S. women's national team through the 2000
Olympics, meaning USC would have an interim coach, expected to be
current assistant Jerritt Elliott, for the 1999 season if Haley
accepts the job.
</P>
<P>
   Also interviewed for the position were Stanford assistant Denise
Corlett, who played at UCLA, and Florida coach Mary Wise.
</P>
<P>
   USC has been searching for a coach since Lisa Love resigned in
April to concentrate on being an associate athletic director at the
university.

 Alza Gets Strong Backing for New Uses of 2 Drugs  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel said yesterday
that Alza Corp. should be allowed to promote new uses for two of
its existing drugs, one to fight the side effects of radiation
therapy and the other to battle advanced ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Saks, chief medical officer of the Palo Alto firm, said the
strong show of support from the advisory panel makes it ``highly
likely'' the FDA will soon give its final blessing to the new uses
of Ethyol and Doxil.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to create additional revenues, drug companies
routinely try to win FDA approval for secondary uses of drugs that
are already on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Ethyol was first approved for use in 1995 as an intravenous
treatment for patients undergoing chemotherapy. Ethyol enters
healthy kidney cells and protects them from the toxic effects of
cancer-fighting drugs, Saks said.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA advisory panel said in an 11-to-1 vote that Ethyol seems
to offer similar protection for the salivary glands of patients
undergoing radiation therapy for head and neck cancer. Saks said
radiation often destroys these glands, making it tough for patients
to swallow or speak.
</P>
<P>
   If the FDA gives final approval, which could be in a matter of
weeks, Alza could advertise the benefits of the $9,000 Ethyol
treatment, Saks said.
</P>
<P>
   Alza's second drug, Doxil, also won FDA approval in 1995 as a
remedy for Kaposi's sarcoma. In this cancerlike condition,
associated with AIDS, patients develop internal or external
lesions. Doxil is a chemotherapy drug wrapped inside a fatty layer
that helps the drug find and kill cancer cells over time while
minimizing damage to healthy tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since it became available for Kaposi's sarcoma, some
doctors have prescribed it to fight ovarian and breast cancer, Saks
said. Doctors often experiment with prescribed drugs to treat
life-threatening situations before the FDA has officially approved
such procedures. But companies cannot promote these so-called
``off-label'' uses until and unless the FDA approves the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Alza wants to advertise Doxil as a secondary remedy for ovarian
cancer patients who have tried current drugs like Taxol but have
not been cured. Saks said Alza is also studying Doxil's effect on
breast cancer in hopes of winning FDA approval for that use in the
``near future,'' Saks said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Sales of Doxil totaled $48 million last year. Sales of
Ethyol, which was developed by Pennsylvania's U.S. Bioscience and
marketed by Alza, hit $32.6 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Securing FDA approval to advertise new uses for the drugs would
``boost growth,'' said analyst David Maris with Bear Stearns in New
York, who thinks Doxil could be a $77 million product in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Alza, one of the few profitable biotech firms, earned $112
million last year on revenues of $584 million. Its shares, which
hit a 52-week high of $55.75 on February 16, slipped 56 cents
yesterday to close at $38.31

RUSSIA JOINS NATO IN URGING YUGOSLAV FORCES TO LEAVE KOSOVO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Russia joined NATO on Tuesday in demanding
Yugoslav forces leave Kosovo, intensifying pressure on President
Slobodan Milosevic to take his troops out of the war-torn province
and allow an international military force to oversee return of
hundreds of thousands of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless he is totally tone deaf, he should be getting the
message it is time to withdraw,'' Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said in Cologne, Germany, where foreign ministers of eight
major powers hammered out final wording of a U.N. resolution on the
Yugoslav pullout and Kosovo's future.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon later reported ``a number of
indications that the Serbs plan to withdraw,'' including massing of
military transport, but ``we have not yet seen any withdrawal.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic sent his generals back Tuesday night to restart talks
with the local NATO commander on the alliance-dictated plan for
taking Belgrade's 40,000 troops out of Kosovo and back into Serbia,
the Yugoslav heartland. British Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson, who will
command the multinational occupation force, returned with the
Yugoslav delegation to the camouflaged tent at Kumanovo air base in
Macedonia where talks collapsed early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations were high at the camp near the Yugoslav border.
NATO spokesman Trey Cate, said: ``We fully expect them to sign
tonight.'' Failure of the earlier discussions prompted the two-day
diplomatic dance that culminated in the proposed U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
   NATO said it would continue air strikes, at an unspecified
level, until the Yugoslav withdrawal begins. Allied spokesman Jamie
Shea said NATO bombing would stop only ``when we see that dust on
the tracks'' as the tanks of Milosevic's force start to depart from
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said NATO needs to see ``a certain amount of movement''
from ``certain zones,'' but he refused to give the exact
formulation, saying that was for Jackson to explain to the Yugoslav
generals.
</P>
<P>
   As outlined by Albright and her colleagues, the latest plan is
for a tightly choreographed script that opens with the Yugoslav
generals agreeing on the NATO withdrawal plan and actually
beginning the retreat from Kosovo. Then would come a suspension of
the NATO bombing, which is apparently a condition for China, one of
five Security Council members with veto power, acquiescing in the
U.N. resolution. That would be followed by the international force
advancing into Kosovo and the first return of refugees, primarily
ethnic Albanians who fled or were exiled by Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key now, as it has been from the beginning of this
process, is implementation,'' President Clinton said in Washington.
``A verifiable withdrawal of Serb forces will allow us to suspend
the bombing and go forward with the plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Exact timings seemed impossible to lay down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot give a categorical guarantee when the process will
be completed,'' said German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer. But
Shea said in Brussels, ``If Milosevic wants, things can go
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Although British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook contended the
basic tenets of the peace plan had ``not been renegotiated in any
shape or form'' since they were agreed to by Milosevic last week,
there was some diplomatic finessing in drafting the resolution. The
central role that NATO is to play in KFOR (for ``Kosovo force``) is
spelled out only in an appendix, a bow to Russian and Chinese
sensitivities.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said an annex carries the same force as the body of the
resolution and declared: ``We got what we came for.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright said that a few Serb officials will be allowed to
remain at border crossings ``as observers'' while refugees return.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs in no way will be able to control who goes back into
Kosovo,'' Albright said. Serb military and police stripped many
Albanian Kosovars of identity papers as they herded them out of
Kosovo earlier in the conflict, perhaps thinking it would
complicate their return. U.N. refugee workers have been issuing
them new identity papers.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said that the Serbs, as one of their ``last-minute
tricks,'' had forced recent refugees to sign documents renouncing
their Yugoslav citizenship. He said the ploy would not prejudice
the refugees' right to return to the province.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said that Milosevic, by insisting on the U.N. resolution,
had apparently hoped to ``ratchet down the (peace) agreement'' of
last week. ``He didn't get away with it,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is expected to send up to 10,000 troops to Kosovo, but
their role in the force remains to be worked out. Igor Ivanov, the
Kremlin foreign minister, left the issue vague, apparently for
domestic consumption in Russia, where there is strong opposition to
Russian troops being commanded by the old Soviet nemesis NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops, in fact, function under NATO direction in the
multinational force in Bosnia, but little is said about the
arrangement. Clinton said he was certain ``acceptable levels of
coordination'' between NATO and Russia could be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Russia also lost out on bids to water down the resolution's
references that make it clear the international force can take
strong military measures to enforce the peace in Kosovo. A second
disputed reference demands the troops help apprehend Serbs indicted
as war criminals by the international tribunal in The Hague,
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to bring an end to the war,'' Ivanov said. ``If we
can achieve that as quickly as possible, we can be satisfied with
this resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland, who represented the
European Union when the peace plan was taken to Belgrade last week,
flew to Beijing to sell Chinese President Jiang Zemin on the
proposal. Although China has been a vocal critic of the NATO
bombing, it rarely invokes its Security Council veto unless a clear
national interest is involved. China could abstain in a vote on the
Kosovo resolution.
</P>
<P>
   All the other nations with a Security Council veto _ the United
States, Russian, Britain and France _ were party to drafting of the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Various groups of geopolitical players stood by to perform their
roles. The North Atlantic Council, NATO's policy-making arm made up
of ambassadors from each of the allied nations, was to meet Tuesday
night in Brussels. The foreign ministers sent the proposed
resolution to U.N. headquarters in New York, where ambassadors from
nations on the Security Council were on alert.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Kosovo is in ruins, and many paths of return studded
with land mines, so the prospects for the multinational force as
well as the refugees may be harrowing.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer said that in addition to the peace plan, the foreign
ministers discussed getting the World Bank and European Union to
quickly work on economic aid needed to help rebuild Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Many political leaders in the United States and Europe have said
that no international aid should go to Serbia as long as Milosevic
remains in power.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer led the talks because his nation currently chairs the
G-8 _ the United States, Russia, Britain, Canada, France, Germany,
Italy and Japan. The group's annual summit is to be held in Cologne
in 10 days, and financing reconstruction of the Balkans is likely
to emerge as a major topic.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who met with Albanian Kosovar chiefs in Germany, won a
promise from a top ethnic leader, Hasim Thaci, to refrain from
attacking Serb troops as they withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Albright flew to Brussels for dinner Tuesday with NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana, who will move to his new job as
chief defense representative for the European Union as soon as the
Yugoslav air campaign is completed.
</P>
<P>
   As the diplomats huddled in Germany trying to get the peace
process back on track, NATO lived up to its promise to step up the
bombing campaign. Allied sorties were up 36 per cent Monday from
the day before, and actual strikes were up 56 percent, NATO said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday and Monday, U.S. B-52s pounded concentrated Serb
positions near the Albanian border. Bacon said he could not confirm
reports that the bombardment had resulted in heavy Serb casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. High Commission for Refugees estimated Tuesday that
more than 985,000 refugees, almost all of them ethnic Albanians had
left Kosovo in the last 15 month, 782,300 since the U.N. bombing
campaign began March 24, which sparked an intensified wave of Serb
aggression and brutality.

 &HT;    BRAVES NOTEBOOK: Weiss to have test on aching quad
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A repeat of history is the last thing Braves shortstop
Walt Weiss wants, but his sore quadriceps is feeling dangerously
familiar.
</P>
<P>
   After spending almost all of last season warding off quadriceps
and hamstring problems that limited him to 96 games, Weiss is
fighting it again. He missed his second consecutive game Tuesday,
and ninth in the past 12 games, after aggravating his strained
quadriceps running to first on a single to lead off the 10th inning
Sunday in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss is scheduled to have an MRI today to gauge the damage. The
disabled list is an option, though he managed to avoid it all last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll wait a day or two, and if there's not much improvement,
we'll make a decision,'' Weiss said. ``My hope is that it doesn't
last four months like it did last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Guillen struggles
</P>
<P>
   Weiss' replacement at shortstop, Ozzie Guillen, has held his own
in the field but continues to struggle at the plate. He was hitting
.141 entering Tuesday night's game, the lowest among Braves
position players, and .111 (4-for-36) as Weiss' replacement in the
starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two weeks I've had real bad at-bats, and I'm not
happy about it,'' Guillen said. ``I'm trying to get five hits in
one at-bat and that doesn't work. . . . I'm not panicking. I've
been there before in my career. . . . They need me now. I've got to
do good until (Weiss) comes back.
</P>
<P>
   Guillen said he takes comfort from knowing that manager Bobby
Cox is behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in a slump, some managers don't want to talk to
you, they hide from you,'' Guillen said. ``Not Bobby. Hopefully I
won't let him down. With him, you get motivation to do good every
day, go hard and do better.''
</P>
<P>
   A. Jones heats up
</P>
<P>
   It's been an on-and-off season offensively for Andruw Jones, who
improved his April average from .204 last year to .272 this year,
but slumped to .252 in May. Entering Tuesday's game, Jones was 13
for his last 60 (.217).
</P>
<P>
   But in his previous two games, Jones reached base in seven of
his last eight trips to the plate and scored four runs. He homered
Monday for the first time since May 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to keep telling yourself to be patient,'' Jones
said. ``Sometimes you try to do too much and chase bad pitches.
When you're patient, that's when you'll be successful. (Monday)
night and the last game in Boston, I've been really relaxed and
looking for the pitch I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Through May last year, Jones was hitting .264 with eight homers
and 30 RBIs. Through Monday night, he was hitting .268 with nine
homers and 32 RBIs.Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko was unavailable for the second consecutive game
because of flu symptoms. Klesko came by the clubhouse to see a team
doctor but didn't stay for the game. . . . New fashion around the
clubhouse? Some navy-colored T-shirts ordered by Justin Speier in
honor of hard-throwing closer John Rocker that say: ``I know the
guy who throws 100 mph.'' And on the back, in a reference to the
relievers: ``I wanna rock. 1999 Braves Grunts.'' . . . All-Star
ballot update: Chipper Jones has pulled to a close second (108,259
votes) behind Matt Williams (109,216) in the most recent release of
fans' voting.

NEWS OF SHURMUR'S LIVER CANCER STUNS SEAHAWKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Something was definitely missing when the
Seattle Seahawks returned to the practice field Monday to begin
their final minicamp.
</P>
<P>
   You could sense it from the lack of enthusiasm and execution in
most drills. You could see it on the faces of the players and
coaches after the 90-minute practice. You could hear it in their
voices as they tried to explain how the team must forge ahead
without defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur.
</P>
<P>
   Shurmur, 66, has begun receiving treatment in Green Bay for
liver cancer, which he was diagnosed with last month and sources
say has spread to other parts of his body.
</P>
<P>
   When, and whether, he returns will be determined by how he
responds to the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   No one will say Shurmur won't return, and although it really is
too early to say it, the possibility is evident because of the
somber undercurrent surrounding his situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The football side of it, you really realize how unimportant it
is when you're talking about someone's life _ especially a man like
Fritz, who basically gives his heart and soul to everything he
does,'' linebacker Darrin Smith said. ``We miss him tremendously,
and we know he misses us.''
</P>
<P>
   The players gathered as a team Monday for the first time since
Shurmur was diagnosed two weeks ago. Before practice, coach Mike
Holmgren explained the seriousness of Shurmur's condition to most
of them for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I thought today's practice was a little lackluster
for the first time,'' Holmgren said, adding that he felt it was a
reaction to what was discussed before the workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about some serious things in there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren also was forced to make some necessary moves.
Linebackers coach Jim Lind will assume the additional duties of
defensive coordinator. In part, because he has been involved with
both the run and pass defense while working with the linebackers
for the past five seasons under Shurmur in Green Bay. But also
because he received Shurmur's endorsement for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fritz is a good friend, and for me he's been a mentor,'' Lind
said. ``He taught me an awful lot. We fished together. So when
something like this happens, it's a major jolt. You make an
adjustment, and you keep going . . . but I think the players
certainly are disappointed because Fritz brought an excellent
reputation with him.''
</P>
<P>
   The defensive playbook already has been completed, so it is
Shurmur's defense that Lind is coaching and coordinating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found myself thinking, `What would Fritz do?' And that's not
all bad,'' Lind said.
</P>
<P>
   In a related move, former Buffalo Bills secondary coach Dick
Roach will join the staff as a defensive assistant. Roach, 61, was
out of the league last year after stints with the Bills (1987-97),
Tampa Bay Buccaneers (1985-86), New England Patriots (1981) and
Kansas City Chiefs (1978-80).
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren hopes that Roach's experience will ease the loss of
Shurmur's wisdom and also provide Lind with a sounding board. Roach
will begin by helping Ken Flajole coach the defensive backs. But,
Holmgren said, ``The job will kind of develop as our minicamps and
training camps go along.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither move was easy for Holmgren because of what they could
ultimately mean.
</P>
<P>
   ``The harsh reality is, I had to do something as far as the
staff is concerned,'' said Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   As difficult as it will be to replace Shurmur the coach, it will
be even harder to replace the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll miss him as a football coach certainly, but he was really
a good friend,'' Holmgren said. ``He was a little bit of a mentor
to me. He'll be a part of this thing as long as he can and as long
as he wants to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Shurmur followed Holmgren to Seattle after he was hired in
January. The players have not known Shurmur that long, but they
quickly developed a bond with him and were looking forward to
playing for a coach who is considered one of the most innovative
defensive minds in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fritz always started off the meetings with a joke,'' Smith
said. ``It wasn't always funny, but at least he tried. Those are
the little things we have to do as a team to keep it going and keep
the focus on doing well.''

MYRON WEINER, EXPERT ON CHILD LABOR ABROAD, DIES  (jw) 
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN  
1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Myron Weiner, a political scientist whose studies of migration,
ethnic conflicts and child labor in the developing world reflected
moral purposes and influenced practical policy, died Thursday at
his home in Moretown, Vt. He was 68.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was brain cancer, said a spokesman for Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, where Weiner had been a professor of
political science for 38 years, until his retirement in April.
</P>
<P>
   Originally specializing in Indian politics, Weiner wrote 32
books, comparing data on political, social and economic issues in
much of the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   The data he uncovered often ran counter to perceived wisdom on
issues like the practicality of widening education in the poorest
of countries. He applied dry data and scholarly language to
passionate issues without becoming polemical.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the 1950s, he became interested in the
comparisons, then widespread, between the comparative growth rates
of a dictatorial but allegedly disciplined Communist China and a
democratic India, generally regarded as slovenly. Drawn by India's
commitment to democracy, he traveled extensively throughout the
country to observe how political parties were formed and structured
and how they developed deep roots even in the most remote of
villages.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Weiner moved further afield, writing about
ethnic violence, the formation of nativist and religious-based
political movements and the flight of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was not an anthropologist, he went beyond examining
texts as he interviewed thousands of ordinary people, asking basic
questions to establish, for example, what level of violence led
people to leave their ancestral homes.
</P>
<P>
   Using such techniques, Weiner wrote ``The Child and the State in
India,'' a volume published by Princeton University Press in 1991,
which many of his colleagues believe changed the terms of the
debate on child labor in India and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was his crowning achievement,'' said professor Jadish
Bhagwati, a Columbia University economist who had known Weiner
since the mid-1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made all of us think about the question of illiteracy,''
said Bhagwati.
</P>
<P>
   Before Weiner's work, which was subtitled ``Child Labor and
Education Policy in Comparative Perspective,'' the general view of
many politicians was that India was simply too poor to do very much
about either child labor or the lack of universal access to
education. The thinking was that poor parents sent their children
to work to help the family budget and this was not likely to change
until incomes rose.
</P>
<P>
   Weiner countered by presenting historical arguments showing that
in poor 19th century societies like Scotland, reforms expanding
education, which were spurred by religious ideals, preceded rather
than followed higher incomes. Even more convincingly, his charts
showed that countries much poorer than India, including a number in
Africa, had done a better contemporary job than India in reducing
illiteracy and extending education. In the book, China, the country
to which India has so often been compared and to which it often
compares itself, was also shown to have done better than India.
</P>
<P>
   Bhagwati noted that even as Weiner was gathering material, he
was bringing facts to the attention of important officials who had
thought they knew the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me that he had a meeting with the man who was the
chief civil servant in charge of education in New Delhi,'' Bhagwati
recalled. ``The two argued over whether there was compulsory
education or not in India. Myron said there wasn't and the
secretary insisted there was a constitutional provision. Eventually
Myron pointed out to him the language that the secretary had
assumed to be a guarantee merely enabled the various states to pass
their own legislation to provide compulsory education, which most
of them had not done.''
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Cohen, chairman of the department of political science at
MIT, said that the book had a profound impact in India. ``Here was
a work, written by a friend of India, which presented irrefutable
facts. It presented comparative statistics, and while it raised
moral issues, it was not written as a moral diatribe.''
</P>
<P>
   Bhagwati said that the economic implication of the book was that
efforts were needed to make poor people realize that the education
of their children was a useful investment rather than a burden. He
said the book helped to spur economists to recommend policies aimed
at higher national growth rates and more investment in education of
the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Weiner was born in New York City and graduated from City College
in 1951. He earned a master's at Princeton in 1953 and his
doctorate there in 1955. He taught at Princeton and at the
University of Chicago before moving to MIT in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Among Weiner's more recent books were ``The Global Migration
Crisis: Challenge to States and to Human Rights'' (Harper Collins,
1995), ``Threatened People, Threatened Borders: World Migration and
U.S. Policy'' (W. Norton), which he edited in 1995 and ``The State
and Social Transformation in Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan''
(Syracuse University Press) of which he was co-editor, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He served as a consultant to the State Department and the World
Bank and since 1966 had been chairman of an advisory committee to
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Weiner is survived by his wife, Sheila Leiman Weiner; a son,
Saul of Chicago, and a daughter, Beth Datskovsky of Bala Cynwyd,
Pa., and five grandchildren.

N.J. UNIONIZED STATE WORKERS VOTE TO AUTHORIZE STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ New Jersey's 27,000 unionized state employees
have voted to authorize a strike if Gov. Christie Whitman does not
meet their demands to increase wages, freeze workers' health care
costs and preserve the civil service seniority system, union
officials announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With the current four-year contract expiring June 30, the strike
authorization won overwhelming support from state workers, who say
they sacrificed during the state's lean fiscal years and are now
entitled to share in New Jersey's billion-dollar budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The strike threat also underlines the bitter opposition to
Whitman's plan to replace the state's byzantine civil service job
classification system with a merit system that would weaken the
role that seniority plays in promotions and layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   State officials and union leaders declined to reveal the
specifics of the state's contract proposals. But Larry Mancino,
vice president of District One of the Communication Workers of
America, pointed out that the union had accepted two years of wage
freezes during its last negotiation, followed by only small annual
raises, and that workers had been forced to pay for 20 percent of
their health insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Mancino said the governor's plan to alter the seniority system
had complicated the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're going to try to force through some merit system
that we can't live with or force through an increase in employees'
health care costs, we're going to end up with a strike,'' Mancino
said at a news conference in the State House. ``But I think there's
a lot of room to work things out short of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mancino's announcement of the strike authorization, which was
approved by 91 percent of the members, included some conciliatory
notes. For one thing, Mancino's news conference was devoid of the
angry rhetoric that has marked many past negotiations between the
state and its employees.
</P>
<P>
   Mancino also said that the Whitman administration's first
contract proposal, which was offered to the union after the strike
vote was scheduled, was ``a good starting point.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no law that specifically prohibits New Jersey public
employees from striking, but the courts have repeatedly ruled that
such strikes are illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman did not comment on the strike vote, but her press
secretary, Jayne O'Connor, said the state would take action to stop
a walkout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a responsibility to provide services to the people in
this state,'' Ms. O'Connor said, ``and if state workers are going
to disrupt that, we won't hesitate to go to court and stop it.''

DOLE SAYS HUSBAND HAS KEY FUND-RAISING ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Elizabeth Dole, continuing to run a distant second
in the polls to Republican presidential front-runner George W.
Bush, said Tuesday that she has turned the corner in fund-raising
with help from the most reluctant source she knows: her husband,
Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, who Wednesday travels to Boston and New
Hampshire, said in an interview that her husband ``never raised
money for himself. He hates to ask people for money. And he didn't
do it in his own campaign. But you know what he's doing? He's on
the phone raising money for me. He's going to do four fund-raisers
in June.''
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of Bob Dole as a financial focal point in
Elizabeth Dole's campaign, while long anticipated by some,
underscores the urgency felt by many candidates to have strong
financial reports to be filed at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   With a number of campaigns suffering from a monetary drought,
Dole could strengthen her position significantly if she proves she
has the financial muscle to fight Bush through the fall and winter.
She told reporters and editors in the Boston Globe Washington
Bureau that she has raised $500,000 in the past week. Now her
campaign hopes that Bob Dole, who last month said it would be
difficult for her to be a candidate if she couldn't raise enough
money, will help erase any lingering doubt about his wife's staying
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind asking for money,'' she said. But, she added,
``It sure is easier when you can ask someone for $1 million than
$1,000,'' contrasting her experience as president of the American
Red Cross and asking for donations with being a presidential
candidate subject to federal contribution limits.
</P>
<P>
   Dole hired a new chief strategist, Tony Fabrizio, who was the
pollster in her husband's 1996 campaign. Asked Tuesday if she is
positioning herself as the moderate in the GOP field, she
responded, ``I'm not the strategist.'' Instead, she called herself
a ``mainstream conservative'' and a ``change agent'' who prides
herself on taking ``cutting edge'' stances and looks for ``the
tough issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole, who started collecting money later than most candidates,
raised $685,253 in the first quarter of this year. Bush, by
contrast, collected $7.6 million in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm suspending judgment until I see the figures for this
quarter,'' political analyst Stuart Rothenberg said. ``She better
have raised $3 (million) to $4 million.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Bush's fund-raising success is draining much of
the financial oxygen out of the Republican race, making it
difficult for most other GOP candidates to raise money. For
example, Lamar Alexander recently laid off some aides because of
financial problems, and two top fund-raisers for former vice
president Dan Quayle recently left his staff. An exception to the
trend is publisher Steve Forbes, who is using his personal fortune
and already is running television advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Tuesday's interview, Dole stressed that she believes
she is gaining support from people outside the political
establishment, especially from younger people. Enthusiastically
recalling the crowds attending her events in college towns, she
said: ``It's not a strategy. It's what's coming to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, she has been on something of a political
roller-coaster ride, bouncing from 24 percent in the polls in April
to 14 percent in a Gallup survey conducted last weekend, far behind
Bush's 46 percent support in the the same poll.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, known for years as a strong antiabortion advocate,
surprised some of her longtime associates by declaring that
abortion should be a non-issue in the campaign. Then Dole told a
New Hampshire audience she favors some gun-control measures,
including safety locks on handguns, an announcement that garnered
much publicity and seemed prescient in light of the Senate's
subsequent approval of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Dole signaled that one of the next issues she will tackle will
be the environment. She said the most important legacy to be left
to Wednesday's children is clean air and clean water. ``Those who
cause the pollution should pay for the pollution,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dole heads Wednesday to Massachusetts, where she once taught
high school and was a student at Harvard Law School. ``Boston was a
second home to me,'' she said. ``I left part of my heart there.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole recalled that when she was one of about two dozen women at
Harvard in 1962, she encountered a male student who questioned why
she was there. ``What are you doing?'' Dole recalled his saying.
``Don't you realize that there are men who could use a legal
education?'' Dole said this man is now a Washington lawyer who is
petrified she will reveal his name.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the only woman in the presidential race, Dole said she
doesn't feel at any disadvantage. To the contrary, she said, the
country is ready for a woman president. ``We are behind'' other
nations, she said, citing Britain's Margaret Thatcher and Israel's
Golda Meir as women who have led a country's government.
</P>
<P>
   After Dole speaks Wednesday at the Harvard Business School, a
speech that is closed to the press, she plans to go to Portsmouth,
N.H. In an ironic twist, Dole now points to her husband's defeat in
the state's primary in 1996 as evidence that she can beat Bush. At
this time four years ago, the Dole campaign notes, Bob Dole was
beating Buchanan by 51 percent to 10 percent but still lost the
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush really hasn't gotten out of Texas,'' Dole said,
suggesting that the front-runner will lose momentum as he heads to
the campaign trail for the first time this weekend in Iowa and next
week in New Hampshire. Asked when she will start heading up in the
polls, she said: ``Wait until next week!''

HANNAH PAKULA: PROFESSIONAL SUCCESS THAT DIDN'T BEGIN UNTIL
MIDLIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAN HOFFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hannah Pakula set her condition for this interview:
attention must be paid to Human Rights Watch. Its 10th annual film
festival begins Wednesday night with a benefit screening of ``The
Parallax View,'' the 1974 political thriller directed by Alan J.
Pakula, Ms. Pakula's husband, who died in a car crash on the Long
Island Expressway in November.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiation ensued. Ms. Pakula is a journalist and biographer
who understands how these things can play out. She is also known in
New York social circles as a woman of stunning, even formidable
presence, accomplished in the art of the gracious dinner party, one
to whom public face and personal dignity mean much. ``All right,
dear,'' she said, adding firmly, ``but don't make me out to be the
brave widow.''
</P>
<P>
   To many who know Ms. Pakula, 65, her own biography is a story of
how expectations of upper-middle-class women changed from the 1950s
to the 1990s. (It is also a life scored, several times over, by
tragedy and luxury.) Raised to be the perfect wife/hostess/mother,
or, in a friend's words, ``a Jewish geisha,'' she did not fully
realize her intellectual gifts until she was about 50, when she
threw herself into human rights advocacy and published her first
book, about Queen Marie of Romania, which upon its reissue the
novelist Graham Greene called the best biography of 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Her second biography, ``An Uncommon Woman,'' a highly praised
study of Empress Frederick of Germany, appeared in 1995. She is now
researching the life of Madame Chiang Kai-shek. ``Alan said all
three women were smarter than their husbands, but had to work
through them,'' she said slyly, ``and he wondered what that was
about.''
</P>
<P>
   She sat the other morning in the library of her Upper East Side
home, furnished with the elegance of two people who read, traveled
and shopped together with hunger and seriousness. They chose New
York, because of its multitude of professionals, rather than Los
Angeles, where Pakula, who directed ``Klute'' and ``Sophie's
Choice,'' worked extensively. A sought-after couple, they
entertained frequently, drawing marquee names from the Manhattan
and Hamptons worlds of high society, journalism, finance and film.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pakula grew up in Los Angeles, her father a representative
of auto-parts manufacturers, her mother bent on seeing her
beautiful daughter well married. ``I was Miss Perfect,'' she said.
``Quite a burden.'' Although she wanted to attend Radcliffe, her
parents feared she would become a bluestocking, and so sent her to
Wellesley. In her junior year, she married Robert Boorstin, a
financier whose family owned a Texas oil business. For the next 15
years, she lived well, playing tennis, raising a daughter and twin
sons.
</P>
<P>
   Then, while the couple were vacationing in Greece, Boorstin
collapsed and died of a heart attack in front of his wife. She was
35.
</P>
<P>
   Falling apart was not an option. ``I realized I was the only
person in the world who cares more about those children than
anything else,'' she said. ``They're needier than you. So you go
on. I became like a mama lion.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, she married Pakula. Shortly thereafter, he
made ``The Parallax View,'' with Warren Beatty, about political
assassination conspiracies. It includes a montage of religious and
family-values images whose meanings turn distorted and violent.
``That has great resonance today,'' Ms. Pakula said.
</P>
<P>
   Although imbued with social confidence, Ms. Pakula felt shaky as
a writer. Pakula, an actor's director, similarly bolstered his
wife. ``He gave me the space to experiment,'' she said. ``I
couldn't fail. Alan said, `It's OK. Fall flat on your face.' That
was an enormous gift. He gave me his protection. He honored work,
successful or not.''
</P>
<P>
   At Pakula's memorial service in February, Ms. Pakula's son
Robert said: ``He learned from her not to be scared of loving to
the fullest, and in return he taught her not to be scared of living
to the fullest.''
</P>
<P>
   While Pakula was filming ``All the President's Men,'' Ms. Pakula
found her metier: biography. Although she had no research training,
she is disciplined, exacting and curious (she calls her
intellectual ambition ``arrogant'' and ``hubristic''). She spent
seven years immersed in Balkan history to write ``The Last
Romantic'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster), her exploration of the glittering
Queen Marie. She spent six weeks in Romania at the height of the
repressive Ceausescu regime. In those years she joined the PEN
American Center, eventually becoming a co-chairwoman of the Freedom
to Write Committee, writing letters for imprisoned writers.
</P>
<P>
   With an investigator for Human Rights Watch, she traveled to
Indonesia and Turkey. Along with Pakula and others, she helped form
Human Rights Watch/Film Watch, which enlists American filmmakers to
write on behalf of foreign directors under political attack.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, her son, Robert, now an official with the
U.S. Treasury Department, suffered two breakdowns. Manic depression
was diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   How did she manage?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is,'' she said coolly, ``what you do.''
</P>
<P>
   It is now just over six months since Pakula died. For Ms.
Pakula, there is a new dog from a pound (``we were both lonely''),
talk of her late husband that shifts unsteadily between present
tense and past, the next biography.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't write about myself,'' she said. ``That's why I write
about other people.''

DOLE SAYS HUSBAND HAS KEY FUND-RAISING ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Elizabeth Dole, continuing to run a distant second
in the polls to Republican presidential front-runner George W.
Bush, said Tuesday that she has turned the corner in fund-raising
with help from the most reluctant source she knows: her husband,
Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, who Wednesday travels to Boston and New
Hampshire, said in an interview that her husband ``never raised
money for himself. He hates to ask people for money. And he didn't
do it in his own campaign. But you know what he's doing? He's on
the phone raising money for me. He's going to do four fund-raisers
in June.''
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of Bob Dole as a financial focal point in
Elizabeth Dole's campaign, while long anticipated by some,
underscores the urgency felt by many candidates to have strong
financial reports to be filed at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   With a number of campaigns suffering from a monetary drought,
Dole could strengthen her position significantly if she proves she
has the financial muscle to fight Bush through the fall and winter.
She told reporters and editors in the Boston Globe Washington
Bureau that she has raised $500,000 in the past week. Now her
campaign hopes that Bob Dole, who last month said it would be
difficult for her to be a candidate if she couldn't raise enough
money, will help erase any lingering doubt about his wife's staying
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind asking for money,'' she said. But, she added,
``It sure is easier when you can ask someone for $1 million than
$1,000,'' contrasting her experience as president of the American
Red Cross and asking for donations with being a presidential
candidate subject to federal contribution limits.
</P>
<P>
   Dole hired a new chief strategist, Tony Fabrizio, who was the
pollster in her husband's 1996 campaign. Asked Tuesday if she is
positioning herself as the moderate in the GOP field, she
responded, ``I'm not the strategist.'' Instead, she called herself
a ``mainstream conservative'' and a ``change agent'' who prides
herself on taking ``cutting edge'' stances and looks for ``the
tough issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole, who started collecting money later than most candidates,
raised $685,253 in the first quarter of this year. Bush, by
contrast, collected $7.6 million in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm suspending judgment until I see the figures for this
quarter,'' political analyst Stuart Rothenberg said. ``She better
have raised $3 (million) to $4 million.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Bush's fund-raising success is draining much of
the financial oxygen out of the Republican race, making it
difficult for most other GOP candidates to raise money. For
example, Lamar Alexander recently laid off some aides because of
financial problems, and two top fund-raisers for former vice
president Dan Quayle recently left his staff. An exception to the
trend is publisher Steve Forbes, who is using his personal fortune
and already is running television advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Tuesday's interview, Dole stressed that she believes
she is gaining support from people outside the political
establishment, especially from younger people. Enthusiastically
recalling the crowds attending her events in college towns, she
said: ``It's not a strategy. It's what's coming to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, she has been on something of a political
roller-coaster ride, bouncing from 24 percent in the polls in April
to 14 percent in a Gallup survey conducted last weekend, far behind
Bush's 46 percent support in the the same poll.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, known for years as a strong antiabortion advocate,
surprised some of her longtime associates by declaring that
abortion should be a non-issue in the campaign. Then Dole told a
New Hampshire audience she favors some gun-control measures,
including safety locks on handguns, an announcement that garnered
much publicity and seemed prescient in light of the Senate's
subsequent approval of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Dole signaled that one of the next issues she will tackle will
be the environment. She said the most important legacy to be left
to Wednesday's children is clean air and clean water. ``Those who
cause the pollution should pay for the pollution,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dole heads Wednesday to Massachusetts, where she once taught
high school and was a student at Harvard Law School. ``Boston was a
second home to me,'' she said. ``I left part of my heart there.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole recalled that when she was one of about two dozen women at
Harvard in 1962, she encountered a male student who questioned why
she was there. ``What are you doing?'' Dole recalled his saying.
``Don't you realize that there are men who could use a legal
education?'' Dole said this man is now a Washington lawyer who is
petrified she will reveal his name.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the only woman in the presidential race, Dole said she
doesn't feel at any disadvantage. To the contrary, she said, the
country is ready for a woman president. ``We are behind'' other
nations, she said, citing Britain's Margaret Thatcher and Israel's
Golda Meir as women who have led a country's government.
</P>
<P>
   After Dole speaks Wednesday at the Harvard Business School, a
speech that is closed to the press, she plans to go to Portsmouth,
N.H. In an ironic twist, Dole now points to her husband's defeat in
the state's primary in 1996 as evidence that she can beat Bush. At

primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush really hasn't gotten out of Texas,'' Dole said,
suggesting that the front-runner will lose momentum as he heads to
the campaign trail for the first time this weekend in Iowa and next
week in New Hampshire. Asked when she will start heading up in the
polls, she said: ``Wait until next week!''

SPREWELL FITS COMPANY'S IMAGE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Pa., Minn., Calif., Ga., Ill.)  (jw) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSEMONT, Pa. _ Inside the company that markets Latrell Sprewell
as ``The American Dream,'' sneakers are strewn on stained
carpeting, jammed against walls and hung from cork boards. The top
executives wear baggy shorts, T-shirts and sneakers, speak in
street lingo and try to get in a daily run of hoops.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Game and Your Momma ... They're Both Phat'' is among the
raft of trash-talk slogans emblazoned on the company's posters and
billboards. Photographs and newspaper clippings, mostly about
Sprewell, are taped to doors. In this cramped suburban office suite
that is more locker room than workplace, Spree is a deity.
</P>
<P>
   There is attitude aplenty at And 1, where the founders were so
consumed with basketball that they started a company in 1993 that
manufactures only footwear and apparel for hoops-obsessed
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   But if you lack serious game _ if you're unwilling to ``break
ankles and rain jumpers with no conscience,'' as one of the
promotional pieces suggests _ And 1 would prefer that you wear
sneakers by Nike, Adidas or Fila.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their single-mindedness made And 1 what it is,'' said Keith
Daly, a senior vice president of Footaction USA, the retail chain,
which is And 1's top customer. ``They're totally focused on a niche
that they live and breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   It offers no running, tennis, soccer or cross-training sneakers.
It has no yen to expand beyond basketball because that's what the
founders care about and what pushed sales from zero in 1993 to an
estimated $120 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   And 1 has impressed retailers and analysts because it has
quadrupled its share of the basketball shoe market from 1997 to
1998, said the NPD Group, an athletic footwear tracking service.
The market has been hurt because of an oversaturation of expensive
shoes endorsed by athletes, many of whom have been cut from
corporate rosters, and a shift to brown shoes like Doc Martens.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tapped into a vein of kids playing basketball better than
anyone while everyone was marketing athlete athletes,'' said John
Horan, editor of Sporting Goods Intelligence, an industry
newsletter. ``You could argue that they've focused too much on
basketball and that it's a great strategy to go to $100 million,
but not so great to go to $500 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Having bonded with consumers through T-shirts, sneakers and a
Web site, And 1 embraced the talented, erratic and chaotic
Sprewell. His infamy was secured when he was suspended from the
Golden State Warriors for most of the 1997-98 season for choking
Coach P.J. Carlesimo in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel he deserved a second chance,'' Seth Berger, And 1's
president, said Monday in his cluttered office in a Philadelphia
suburb. ``You can't undo what he did. But he apologized. It was
time to move on. But there will always be people who won't forgive
him.''
</P>
<P>
   And 1 adored Sprewell from the day he joined the Warriors in
1992, envied Converse for signing him to endorse its sneakers and
faxed his agent last year when his ties to Converse ended, offering
to pay him even if he did not play this season. And 1 signed him on
April 19, when the Knicks were 21-20 and not yet in the playoffs.
Four days later, it paid his $25,000 fine when his agent criticized
Knicks' management.
</P>
<P>
   The Sprewell commercial broke last month. Until then, And 1 was
known to basketball aficionados and readers of magazines like
``Inside Stuff.'' But as a company in Nike's muscular shadow, And 1
existed on the public periphery.
</P>
<P>
   The spot shows Sprewell having his hair corn-rowed while he
speaks: ``People say I'm what's wrong with sports. I say I'm a
three-time NBA All-Star. People say I'm America's worst nightmare.
I say I'm the American dream.''
</P>
<P>
   In the background, an electric guitar plays ``The Star-Spangled
Banner.''
</P>
<P>
   The spot encapsulates what appears to be a risky strategy. To
the over-30s, Sprewell is easy to reject as a viable commercial
spokesman. But he appeals to the company's 12-to-18-year-old
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our marketing has to make sense to the kids,'' said Jay Coen
Gilbert, vice president and co-founder. ``Every kid with game is
fiercely competitive and talks trash and smack, at least inside his
head.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger added, ``He acknowledged his mistake but also said,
`Don't forget, I'm a three-time NBA All-Star,' which for every
16-year-old is the American Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a week of the spot's first national exposure, the Knicks
had beaten Miami in their first-round playoff series and Sprewell
had scored 31 points in consecutive games in the next series
against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The spot provoked instant debate on talk radio and in other
segments of the news media. Was Sprewell worthy of starring in a
commercial campaign for an estimated $500,000 annually? Should he
be treated differently from other commercialized ``bad boys'' like
Allen Iverson or Dennis Rodman?
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert, Berger and Tommy Austin launched And 1 in 1993 by
selling T-shirts with trash-talk slogans that were devised during
lively in-house meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert and Berger have known each other since seventh grade at
the Horace Mann School in Manhattan. The threesome had scant
knowledge of manufacturing, finance or administration and no
experience whatever in sporting goods other than being frequent
purchasers of sneakers, T-shirts and shorts.
</P>
<P>
   The T-shirts began selling in 1993 and quickly exploded.
Retailers like Footaction and Foot Locker liked the goods and
encouraged And 1 to accelerate its expansion into footwear by three
years. But their first shoe, one endorsed by Stephon Marbury of the
Minnesota Timberwolves, turned into a minidisaster.
</P>
<P>
   First, it was a ``bad-looking shoe with poor value,'' Gilbert
said. Then, Marbury sprained his ankle badly wearing the And 1
sneaker for the first time early in the first game of his 1996
rookie season. Even worse, And 1 introduced the shoe with what it
called the ``Breaking Ankles'' print campaign, which featured an
X-ray of a broken ankle in the advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury left And 1 last year in a contractual dispute. The
company has since added a dozen other endorsers, including
Philadelphia's Larry Hughes, Sacramento's Chris Webber and
Orlando's Darrell Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   And then came Sprewell, whose impact on And 1 sales has not been
felt. ``You could get an immediate impact if you have Michael
Jordan or spend millions of dollars in marketing money,'' Gilbert
said. ``This is a long-term thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger said rapid success would neither nudge the company to
expand beyond basketball nor induce it to sell stock through a
public offering. He said, ``Just think of what a shareholder would
think if we signed Sprewell.'' &QL;

FRESH GROUP OF DRIVERS CLOSING IN ON NASCAR TRUCK STARS SPRAGUE,
HORNADAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jack Sprague is in his accustomed place: atop the NASCAR
Craftsman Truck series standings.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Hornaday isn't too far off his usual pace. He's in third
place, within striking distance.
</P>
<P>
   It looks like the same old, same old as the series comes to town
for the running of the Pronto Auto Parts 400K on Friday night at
Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Sprague and Hornaday. Sprague, who won the points title in 1997.
Hornaday who won last year and in '96, with Sprague finishing
second each year.
</P>
<P>
   Hornaday and Sprague, who have combined to win four _ two each _
of the nine races this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both want to win, and that's all there is to it,'' Sprague
said. ``I think we give the fans what they pay for.''
</P>
<P>
   However, there is more to the series this year than the two
familiar warriors. The top end of the standings is populated by new
faces, relative newcomers to the series who are determined to knock
off the Big Two.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's changing,'' Hornaday said. ``You've got different
drivers winning races, guys in the top five that weren't there
before. The competition level has grown by leaps and bounds. In
this truck series, everybody's trying to make a name for
themselves. These kids want to beat Jack Sprague and Ron Hornaday,
because if they can do that it will put them on the map. So when
that green flag drops, it's tough racing. They come from different
divisions, they're all winners, they've won championships, and when
they strap in there, they want to see the checkered flag, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Compton is one of the guys putting pressure on Sprague and
Hornaday, along with Andy Houston, Dennis Setzer, Kevin Harvick,
Greg Biffle and Kevin Cywinski.
</P>
<P>
   All are in the top 10 in points as the series comes to TMS. Only
Compton and Biffle were there at the end of last season, and none
was in '97.
</P>
<P>
   All are in their second or third full season racing trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys have been doing it from the start of the thing, for
the last five years,'' Compton said of Sprague and Hornaday. ``This
is our third year. Everybody is closer to catching up with those
guys and those teams than we ever have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough series, and it's a competitive series. Each week
we see qualifying getting closer and closer, and more trucks on the
lead laps at the end of races.''
</P>
<P>
   Compton is the most consistent driver, not only among the new
faces but in the entire series. He has finished in the top five
eight times in the nine races and is second in points.
</P>
<P>
   He's doing it even though a switch to Dodge from Ford could have
meant a slow start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like starting over,'' Compton said. ``We had a lot to
learn, and a lot of trucks to build.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the switch to the unfamiliar truck, Compton is
continuing a steady rise to the top. In 1997, he finished 13th in
the points and third in the rookie standings. Last year he improved
to seventh.
</P>
<P>
   It is a pattern seen in the other newcomers to the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   Biffle was eighth as a rookie last year, when he had four poles,
led five of seven races and twice finished second.
</P>
<P>
   He picked up his first career victory this year in the Memphis
200 on May 8 and is seventh in the points.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a few things that are major factors,'' Biffle said.
``One is going back to the racetracks now that I've seen them once,
knowing the racetrack and what it looks like. And eliminating the
rookie mistakes I made.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston could say the same thing. Last year he was second to
Biffle in the rookie standings and 12th overall.
</P>
<P>
   This season the 29-year-old son of former Busch Grand National
standout Tommy Houston is fourth in the points.
</P>
<P>
   Houston is followed by Setzer and Harvick.
</P>
<P>
   Setzer is in his first full-time season in the trucks. He subbed
for an ailing Bob Keselowski last year and finished in the top 10
three times in the final six races, including a victory at the
Dodge California Truck Stop 300 on Oct. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Harvick is the series' ``kid,'' a talented 23-year-old driver.
He had three top-five finishes last year, including a career-best
fourth at the TMS race, and was 17th in the points while also
competing full time in _ and winning _ the Winston West series.
</P>
<P>
   Cywenski, the 1997 American Speed Association champion, was 28th
last year. This year he's up to eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the season is still early. The Pronto Auto Parts 400
is the 10th of 25 races. The challenge for the newcomers is to stay
competitive all season.
</P>
<P>
   But Hornaday, for one, expects the series to remain close.
</P>
<P>
   ``As close as the points are, I think you're going to see five
or six teams coming down to the last couple of races,'' Hornaday
said.
</P>
<P>
   The truck series no longer is just Sprague and Hornaday.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's Sprague, Hornaday and Co. \Ntagtop:Simon Gonzalez,

FRESH GROUP OF DRIVERS CLOSING IN ON NASCAR TRUCK STARS SPRAGUE,
HORNADAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jack Sprague is in his accustomed place: atop the NASCAR
Craftsman Truck series standings.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Hornaday isn't too far off his usual pace. He's in third
place, within striking distance.
</P>
<P>
   It looks like the same old, same old as the series comes to town
for the running of the Pronto Auto Parts 400K on Friday night at
Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Sprague and Hornaday. Sprague, who won the points title in 1997.
Hornaday who won last year and in '96, with Sprague finishing
second each year.
</P>
<P>
   Hornaday and Sprague, who have combined to win four _ two each _
of the nine races this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both want to win, and that's all there is to it,'' Sprague
said. ``I think we give the fans what they pay for.''
</P>
<P>
   However, there is more to the series this year than the two
familiar warriors. The top end of the standings is populated by new
faces, relative newcomers to the series who are determined to knock
off the Big Two.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's changing,'' Hornaday said. ``You've got different
drivers winning races, guys in the top five that weren't there
before. The competition level has grown by leaps and bounds. In
this truck series, everybody's trying to make a name for
themselves. These kids want to beat Jack Sprague and Ron Hornaday,
because if they can do that it will put them on the map. So when
that green flag drops, it's tough racing. They come from different
divisions, they're all winners, they've won championships, and when
they strap in there, they want to see the checkered flag, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Compton is one of the guys putting pressure on Sprague and
Hornaday, along with Andy Houston, Dennis Setzer, Kevin Harvick,
Greg Biffle and Kevin Cywinski.
</P>
<P>
   All are in the top 10 in points as the series comes to TMS. Only
Compton and Biffle were there at the end of last season, and none
was in '97.
</P>
<P>
   All are in their second or third full season racing trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys have been doing it from the start of the thing, for
the last five years,'' Compton said of Sprague and Hornaday. ``This
is our third year. Everybody is closer to catching up with those
guys and those teams than we ever have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough series, and it's a competitive series. Each week
we see qualifying getting closer and closer, and more trucks on the
lead laps at the end of races.''
</P>
<P>
   Compton is the most consistent driver, not only among the new
faces but in the entire series. He has finished in the top five
eight times in the nine races and is second in points.
</P>
<P>
   He's doing it even though a switch to Dodge from Ford could have
meant a slow start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like starting over,'' Compton said. ``We had a lot to
learn, and a lot of trucks to build.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the switch to the unfamiliar truck, Compton is
continuing a steady rise to the top. In 1997, he finished 13th in
the points and third in the rookie standings. Last year he improved
to seventh.
</P>
<P>
   It is a pattern seen in the other newcomers to the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   Biffle was eighth as a rookie last year, when he had four poles,
led five of seven races and twice finished second.
</P>
<P>
   He picked up his first career victory this year in the Memphis
200 on May 8 and is seventh in the points.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a few things that are major factors,'' Biffle said.
``One is going back to the racetracks now that I've seen them once,
knowing the racetrack and what it looks like. And eliminating the
rookie mistakes I made.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston could say the same thing. Last year he was second to
Biffle in the rookie standings and 12th overall.
</P>
<P>
   This season the 29-year-old son of former Busch Grand National
standout Tommy Houston is fourth in the points.
</P>
<P>
   Houston is followed by Setzer and Harvick.
</P>
<P>
   Setzer is in his first full-time season in the trucks. He subbed
for an ailing Bob Keselowski last year and finished in the top 10
three times in the final six races, including a victory at the
Dodge California Truck Stop 300 on Oct. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Harvick is the series' ``kid,'' a talented 23-year-old driver.
He had three top-five finishes last year, including a career-best
fourth at the TMS race, and was 17th in the points while also
competing full time in _ and winning _ the Winston West series.
</P>
<P>
   Cywenski, the 1997 American Speed Association champion, was 28th
last year. This year he's up to eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the season is still early. The Pronto Auto Parts 400

 &HT;    2 sentenced in 'sleeper-hold' killing of Fort Pierce man
 &HT;    By Thomas R. Collins
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT PIERCE, Fla. _ Troy Orr and Patrick Jameson each began
serving two decades of prison time Tuesday for killing 55-year-old
John Coble with a wrestling ``sleeper-hold'' on June 30.
</P>
<P>
   And one of the last things they heard before leaving the
courtroom after sentencing was the agonized voice of Coble's
mother, Dorothy, who stood amid a line of family members a few feet
away from the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``John was very loving, considerate, and a very giving person,''
she said, trying to stifle sobs. ``You took him away from us and
now we have a very large emptiness that cannot be filled. What kind
of people are you? You killed our son.''
</P>
<P>
   Orr, 39, of West Palm Beach, and Jameson, 31, a transient
originally from Michigan, were charged with first-degree murder and
other crimes after confessing in July to killing Coble. The pair
picked Coble up at a truck stop and they went to his home in Fort
Pierce, police said.
</P>
<P>
   After they got there, Jameson put Coble in a ``sleeper-hold'' he
learned in high school and Orr took his money, car and television.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit Judge Marc Cianca sentenced Jameson to 26 years in
prison after Jameson pleaded no contest to second-degree murder and
robbery. Orr, who pleaded no contest to manslaughter and robbery,
got 20 years. Neither is eligible for parole.
</P>
<P>
   Jameson, wearing an orange jail uniform, said he didn't mean to
kill Coble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't an intentional death, your honor,'' he said. ``It
was a wrestling move, a sleeper hold. I did not strangle him. . . .
I just want to apologize to the family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you heard the mother of the victim,'' Cianca told him.
``I suppose that will soak down deep . . . I just want you to do
time, and an abundance of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Coble said she agreed with the judge's sentence, but
told Orr and Jameson that she and her family members ``do not want
either of you back on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Orr, clad in a sea-blue jail suit, simply told the Coble family,
``I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragedy that they faced,'' Cianca told the defendants,
``will hopefully be brought to some kind of closure today.''

 &HT;    Bush's staff questions salary of interim water chief
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The nearly $20,000-a-month salary of
South Florida's top water manager is drawing questions from Gov.
Jeb Bush's staff.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Harvey is drawing $109.92 an hour as interim executive
director of the South Florida Water Management District, which
hired him in March as a temporary consultant.
</P>
<P>
   That's 57 percent more than the $70-an-hour salary of former
Executive Director Sam Poole, who was fired in March by six
Bush-appointed board members.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, district spokesman Bruce Adams said Tuesday,
comes from the dollar value of Poole's other benefits _ including
health insurance, retirement benefits and five hours per week of
accumulated sick and vacation time. As a consultant, Harvey
receives no such benefits, so he's getting them in cash instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is he isn't being paid more than we paid Sam
for the same job,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some board members said this week that they had no idea
they're paying Harvey that much. The board voted March 11 to pay
Harvey ``an amount not to exceed . . . (Poole's) total monthly
compensation'' _ a sum that some interpreted to mean only salary.
</P>
<P>
   The board never voted on the details of the contract. It's being
overseen by Chairman Mike Collins, a friend and business partner of
Harvey's.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers questioned the salary difference last week,
prompting the district to fax a written explanation Friday to
gubernatorial Chief of Staff Sally Bradshaw.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's staff is still studying whether Harvey is getting
a better deal than Poole, Bush spokesman Cory Tilley said Tuesday.
He couldn't explain what drew the staff's attention to Harvey's
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the case is that it's not comparable and Mr. Harvey is
being paid a much larger sum than Mr. Poole was paid, we think the
board should take corrective action and change it,'' Tilley said.
``Obviously it's a little complicated with benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Some board members defended Harvey's contract and said its terms
match what they had approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I understood I was voting for was someone who could keep
the ship on course, and Mr. Harvey has done an extraordinary job of
doing that,'' said Jerry Fernandez, a Miami environmental
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compensation is broader than just salary,'' said Nicolas
Gutierrez, a corporate lawyer in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But two dissenting board members called Harvey's contract a
disturbing surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not what I was asked to vote on,'' said Mitchell
Berger, a Broward County lawyer. ``What we voted on was not a gross
monthly stipend for James Harvey. . . . If that's what their intent
was, it should have been spelled out.''
</P>
<P>
   Vera Carter, a former Orange County commissioner, added: ``I'm
extremely surprised. . . . It never crossed my mind that an interim
director would be entitled to anything but salary.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger, Carter and Michael Minton of Fort Pierce _ all
appointees of former Gov. Lawton Chiles _ voted against firing
Poole and hiring Harvey. The six board members appointed by Bush
supported the actions.
</P>
<P>
   The actions occurred in a single vote March 11, based on wording
that board member Patrick Gleason of Lake Worth has said he
received from Bush Everglades adviser Allison DeFoor.
</P>
<P>
   DeFoor, a former business partner of Harvey and Collins, could
not be reached for comment this week.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey's contract caps his total pay at $89,570 for his tenure,
which is set to end one week after a permanent executive director
begins work. It's unclear when that will happen, although the board
is expected to pick a director Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Poole's salary was $145,600 a year, and he left with a combined
$74,410 in severance pay, unused sick leave and vacation time.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said Harvey made financial sacrifices to take the district
job, including the interruption of his West Palm Beach lobbying
business during its busiest time, the spring legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey also is losing the $966-a-week salary of his wife,
Suzanne, who works in the district's communications office. She is
on unpaid leave but receiving benefits while Harvey serves as
director.
</P>
<P>
   And Adams said other consultants would charge as much as $265 an
hour for work similar to what Harvey is doing.
</P>
<P>
   But Berger said the district didn't have to hire a consultant to
fill in for Poole. He said the agency could have tapped one of its
two deputy executive directors, or accepted Poole's offer to resign
with six months' notice.
</P>
<P>
   Under his original contract, Harvey was supposed to receive
$39,570 for two months, including 45 working days, which was set to
end May 14.
</P>
<P>
   The board voted May 13 to extend the deal for what some board
members thought was a firm period of five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The final paperwork, signed by Harvey and Collins two weeks
later, contains no set deadline, however. It also entitles Harvey
to as much as $50,000 in additional payments, the equivalent of 11
weeks' pay.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said it's unclear when the new director, whoever that is,
will be able to start work. The finalists are three district
employees and two former U.S. Army Corps of Engineers commanders
living in Virginia and Washington state.

OFFICER GUILTY OF HELPING TORTURE IMMIGRANT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to rewrite throughout.)  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED and BLAINE HARDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One police officer was convicted Tuesday of joining
in the torture of Abner Louima in a Brooklyn station house, but
three others were acquitted in the case, which turned the plight of
a Haitian immigrant into a national symbol of police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Charles Schwarz was convicted of holding down Louima
while fellow officer Justin Volpe rammed a stick into his rectum, a
crime that the U.S. attorney, Zachary Carter, Tuesday called ``the
most depraved act that's ever been reported or committed by a
police officer or police officers against another human being.''
</P>
<P>
   The Louima case sullied the crime-busting national reputation of
the New York Police Department, sparked outrage and street protests
among blacks, immigrants and other New Yorkers, and led to a
wide-ranging federal investigation into police brutality in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference with the lawyers representing him in his
civil suit against the city, Louima said he was ``disappointed'' in
the mixed verdict, but remained ``confident that in the end
complete justice will be done in my case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope what comes out of my case is change,'' he added. ``What
happened to me should not happen to any human being, to my children
or anybody else's children.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani Tuesday praised the verdict as a shining
example of police officers who were willing to testify so that
justice could be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I particularly want to congratulate the Police Department,''
the mayor said, ``for breaking down the appearance that there is
some kind of reluctance on the part of police officers to testify
against other police officers when they have knowledge of serious
criminal conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   The three officers acquitted by the jury were Thomas Wiese, 35,
and Thomas Bruder, 33, who had been charged with beating Louima in
a police car before he got to the station house, and Sgt. Michael
Bellomo, 37, who was accused of covering up the beating.
</P>
<P>
   After the verdict Tuesday, Carter gave a sober assessment of
what lessons have been learned from the case. Carter said that that
the court system is making ``some progress toward getting police
officers _ at least in this extreme circumstance _ to testify
against the police officers who were responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, ``We haven't made all the progress we would
like.''
</P>
<P>
   When the verdict against him was announced in a packed federal
courtroom in Brooklyn, Schwarz, 33, initially stared straight ahead
and showed no reaction at all. After 18 hours of deliberation, an
anonymous jury of seven men and five women found him guilty of
violating Louima's civil rights through a sexual assault. He could
be sentenced to as much as life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   As the jury filed in with its verdict, relatives of the officers
dabbed back tears and held hands, and a few jiggled their legs in
nervous anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as the verdicts were read, there were sobs of joy at each
``not guilty,'' followed by cries of anger with each ``guilty.''
Wiese's brother, Louis Wiese, fell to his knees and wrapped his
arms around Wiese's girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the jury wept as they filed from the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Schwarz's family cursed at the prosecutors as they
left. As one of the prosecutors, Alan Vinegrad, was leaving the
courtroom, a woman who appeared to be a relative of Schwarz
screamed ``I hope your family sits shiva for you,'' referring to
the Jewish formal mourning period, observed in the deceased's home.
Vinegrad continued to walk briskly from the court.

JOHN CHEVEDDEN STRIVES TO HAVE SHAREHOLDERS HEARD THROUGH VOTESD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On April 26, shareholders of Airborne Freight Corp. voted that
directors be elected every year instead of every three years. The
board recommended a ``no'' vote, but 66 percent of the shareholders
voting were voted ``yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Airborne hasn't responded, and no board meeting is scheduled
until August. It was not a binding resolution, anyway. But it was a
clear statement by Airborne's owners.
</P>
<P>
   David Anderson, the Seattle company's counsel and secretary,
said those owners are mostly institutions. ``I heard from a few of
them,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a reflection on Airborne or Airborne's management. It
tends to be their overall view: They don't want anything to impede
a potential takeover.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure was the work of John Chevedden, a former production
scheduler for Hughes Aircraft who was laid off in 1992. Since then
Chevedden has become a corporate gadfly in the tradition of John
Gilbert and Evelyn Davis, who have been questioning poison pills,
CEO perks, the independence of directors and other such matters for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Chevedden, 53, of Redondo Beach, Calif., has sponsored votes at
Boeing, Paccar, AlliedSignal, General Motors and others.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his measures come up every year. At Boeing, 48 percent
voted for annual election of directors in 1996, 48 percent in 1997,
42 percent in 1998 and 49.8 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   In Boeing's proxy this year, Chevedden argued that staggered
terms give directors ``three years of isolation from the
consequences of poor decisions.'' Boeing responded that they reduce
``the chance that a third party will effect a sudden, unsolicited
change in the company's direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Chevedden has other resolutions. At General Motors, 16 percent
of shareholders supported his 1996 proposal that the chairman be
from management. At Northrup Grumman, 12 percent supported his 1998
proposal to limit ``golden parachutes'' for management in case the
company were sold.
</P>
<P>
   This year 64 percent at Northrup Grumman voted for his proposal
that shareholders ballot on the adoption by the company of any
poison pill.
</P>
<P>
   The poison pill is a company by-law in which inexpensive shares
are sold to old stockholders to water down the value of the shares
of an unwelcome buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Such resolutions have to follow the rules of the Securities and
Exchange Commission. ``You have to own stock for a year prior to
the day you submit it,'' Chevedden says. ``If you miss it by one
day, they can disqualify you. I missed on Alaska Air.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of these measures don't get on corporate ballots. The
Investor Responsibility Research Center, a group created by
institutional investors, has been tracking 85 measures that would
repeal the staggered board of directors; about half are expected to
come to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   What are the effects of such votes? Jonathan Karpoff, professor
of finance at the University of Washington, says his studies of the
issue have made him skeptical. He says, ``A lot of people, myself
included, went into this research thinking, `This was a good thing.
We're going to find ways to improve company performance.' But the
numbers are different. You find that, on average, shareholder
proposals don't have much impact.'' More important, he says, is
that management not be insulated from a takeover attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Some shareholder votes speak to just that issue. In 1994, 1995
and 1996, Weyerhaeuser shareholders voted on outside proposals to
dismantle the poison pill. In 1996 the resolution passed with 52
percent. That December, the board let the 1980s-vintage poison pill
quietly expire.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Ailman, chief investment officer of the Washington
State Investment Board, says, ``We're not very thrilled with poison
pills or things that may entrench management.''
</P>
<P>
   The board, which manages $52 billion of pension money for public
employees, keeps its stock holdings mostly in index funds. Though
it doesn't vote those shares, it likes the idea of making managers
accountable, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Institutional investors, he says, are more likely to bring up
issues like the poison pill in private meetings with management.
Chevedden's way is not their way. But some managements are
receptive and some are not. There is more than one way to skin a
cat _ or a CEO.
</P>
<P>
   As for the gadflies like John Chevedden, Ailman says, ``We think
they're helpful.''

ARIAS SUPPORTERS WANT REVIEW
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Protesting the choice of Dick Dull as Cal State
Northridge's athletic director, supporters of Robert Arias'
candidacy for the job are seeking a review of the selection
process.
</P>
<P>
   William ``Blinky'' Rodriguez and members of the CSUN Advisory
Board who supported Arias are planning to ask Assembly Speaker
Antonio Villaraigosa, D-Los Angeles, and CSU Chancellor Charles
Reed to look into Dull's hiring on May 26. Dull resigned from his
post as the athletic director at Moravian College, a Division III
school in Bethlehem, Pa., to take the CSUN job.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Dull was the athletic director at Maryland when the
program came under fire after basketball star Len Bias'
cocaine-induced death. Dull resigned five months later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just feel like we can't allow it to be `business as usual,'
'' said Rodriguez, a community leader who was an outspoken advocate
of Arias. ``(Dull) doesn't know the community. He is not making
fund-raising a No. 1 priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Swisher, the media-relations spokesperson for the CSU
office, said Reed is on the East Coast and unavailable for comment.
Swisher said he didn't anticipate Reed taking any action.
</P>
<P>
   ``That search was complete and it was a campus-based decision,''
Swisher said.
</P>
<P>
   John Chandler, who works in CSUN's public-information office,
said the university stands by the choice of Dull, calling him
``eminently qualified.''
</P>
<P>
   Arias, a San Fernando Valley resident, was one of four finalists
for the job that went to Dull, who starts July 1. Rodriguez said
supporters of the inquiry include CSUN Advisory Board members Lee
Alpert, Leroy Chase, Edward Moreno and David Honda.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our understanding, the support (for Arias) was staunch,''
Rodriguez said. ``Many letters were sent to Blenda before she left.
She never answered one of them. We want to know what happened.''

$50,000 REWARD OFFERED FOR SUSPECT LINKED TO DEATHS IN TEXAS,
KENTUCKY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Ky.) 
 
By ERIC HANSON 
and STEPHEN JOHNSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Law officers from Beaumont to San Antonio have formed
a task force to help capture a drifter suspected in six murders in
Texas and Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   And authorities are offering a $50,000 reward for information
leading to the arrest and conviction of Rafael Resendez-Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is brutal,'' said Houston homicide Lt. Ronald Walker, a
task force spokesman. ``In all instances, there are massive head
injuries. It's a blitz-type attack. This is a purely mean man, and
everyone needs to be looking for this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although motor vehicles and other items have been stolen in the
killings, Walker said police do not believe money or property are
motivating the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's more of a power-type play, sexual
gratification,'' he said Tuesday after a meeting here of state,
local and federal officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't get him soon, I'm afraid we are going to find
another innocent victim. He's just not going to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez, 39, is suspected in killings in the Houston
area and in a corridor along the railroad line that runs along
Interstate 10.
</P>
<P>
   He is also a suspect in an Aug. 29, 1997, slaying near a
railroad track in Lexington, Ky., and an investigator said DNA
evidence gathered from the crime scene there is being compared with
that from area homicides. A woman was raped during the Lexington
slaying but survived.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez has also been linked to slayings in Weimar,
Schulenburg and West University Place. All information pertaining
to the case will be channeled through the Houston FBI Command
Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Houston FBI Special Agent in Charge Don K. Clark said that based
on a Harris County burglary indictment of Resendez-Ramirez, the
federal government has charged him with unlawful flight to avoid
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez has a criminal record in California, Florida
and New Mexico on charges ranging from carrying an illegal weapon
to residential burglary.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez is also considered a suspect in a killing in
southwest Houston, where the body of Noemi Dominguez, 26, was found
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   She died from a blow to the head, and her white 1993 Honda Civic
with license number JJH 57N was stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Police have found no concrete evidence linking Resendez-Ramirez
to the killing, but investigators said similarities between it and
the other cases indicate a strong possibility he was involved.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said evidence at Dominguez's house, near a rail line, is
still being processed.
</P>
<P>
   The proximity to rail lines was a key link that investigators
noted when the probe into the multiple area slayings began.
</P>
<P>
   The first case occurred Dec. 17, when the body of Dr. Claudia
Benton, 39, was found in her West University Place home just a few
blocks from railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   She had been beaten and stabbed to death and sexually assaulted.
Her stolen Jeep Cherokee was found abandoned in San Antonio with
Resendez-Ramirez's fingerprint in the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   In March, he was indicted on a charge of burglary in the case.
This charge led to the federal count against Resendez-Ramirez,
allowing the FBI to search for him anywhere in the country, Clark
said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have linked Resendez-Ramirez to the deaths of the
Rev. Norman ``Skip'' Sirnic, 46, and his wife, Karen, 47. They were
found beaten to death with a sledgehammer in the parsonage behind
the Weimar United Church of Christ in Colorado County when they did
not show up for services May 2.
</P>
<P>
   About three weeks later, investigators said evidence found in
the Sirnics' home linked Resendez-Ramirez to the Benton case.
Authorities have declined to release specific details.
</P>
<P>
   The Sirnics' stolen pickup was found May 28 by police in San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   One week later, a relative found the body of Josephine Konvicka,
73, in her house in Fayette County, just 3 1/2 miles from the
Sirnics' home.
</P>
<P>
   Konvicka had been beaten to death and the killer tried to steal
her car but could not locate the keys. Resendez-Ramirez's
fingerprints were found in her home, also near railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The Lexington victim was University of Kentucky student
Christopher Maier, 21. He was beaten to death and his girlfriend
assaulted as they walked along railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said investigators have been flooded with tips and leads.
Those seeking to provide information on Resendez-Ramirez's
whereabouts can call the FBI Command Center at 713-479-6325 or
713-693-5000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are checking any locations where he may be, soup kitchens,
homeless shelters, places where he can get a shower, food,'' Walker
said. ``Wherever these types of individuals congregate, we're
talking to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker said Resendez-Ramirez could be watching his potential
victims or he may simply hop off a train and strike.
</P>
<P>
   He described Resendez-Ramirez as being very elusive, common and
someone who uses anonymity to move about freely.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is how we view the homeless,'' Walker said. ``We walk by
and don't see them. This is the type we are dealing with here, a
transient, the type we have a tendency to overlook.''
</P>
<P>
   Officers from more than 20 police agencies met at DPS
headquarters here to pool their resources and coordinate efforts in
capturing Resendez-Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado County Sheriff R.H. Wied said they hope to find the
suspect by sharing knowledge about the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   An in Hispanic man found dead Friday in Stephen F. Austin State
Park from a head blow was not specifically listed as a suspected
victim of Resendez-Ramirez, and Clark said he did not want to
comment on that case.
</P>
<P>
   The park lies along I-10, which runs through the communities
where the Sirnics and Konvicka were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Wied said officers in his county will be monitoring all freight
trains going through the county and stop them if unauthorized
passengers are spotted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will make sure that this is not the suspect we are looking
for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Weimar Police Chief Bill Livingston said his department has
doubled its patrol activity since the Sirnics' slayings and that
Colorado County officers and DPS troopers are checking the city and
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he is around there, we're going to find him,'' he said.

NEW YORK CITY READING AND MATH SCORES FALL SHARPLY
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew released citywide
reading and math test scores Tuesday that showed a sharp decline
from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   He attributed the plunge to new, more challenging tests and a
higher standard of performance. But he made no effort to play down
the grimness of the new statistics _ the results of citywide
reading and math tests given in third, fifth, sixth and seventh
grades this spring.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was determined ``not to make excuses'' for the
scores, and he pledged to move aggressively in the next weeks to
hold administrators, teachers and students accountable.
</P>
<P>
   Crew said that he would require 70,000 third-, sixth- and
eighth-graders to go to summer school as he phased in tougher
promotional standards that would be expanded to other grades. As a
result of the fourth-grade reading test introduced by the state
this year, which 67 percent of city students failed, 16,000
fourth-graders will be strongly urged to go to summer school, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would set performance targets for next year _
requiring the city's 32 school districts and individual schools to
meet either a test-score target or a target for improvement. Saying
he was distressed by the wide achievement gap between black and
Hispanic children and white and Asian ones, he said he would also
set targets by race, in a program similar to one that has been
adopted in Texas but which generated immediate opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are the targets for blacks and Hispanics going to be higher or
lower than for whites and Asians?'' asked Michael Meyers, executive
director of the New York Civil Rights Coalition, who said he would
watch the policy closely with an eye to a legal challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Crew also promised to use the test scores to sanction and
replace district superintendents, principals and teachers who were
not performing well. ``You are looking at this system going through
a watershed moment in reform,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The city scores have traditionally been among the most closely
watched measures of student performance. Scores have risen steadily
over the last few years, and last year Crew boasted that students
were performing just shy of the national average in reading and
well above it in math, a remarkable achievement given the large
concentration of immigrants and children in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The new scores show students performing significantly below the
national average in reading and about average in math. The scores
of third-graders _ the centerpiece of a focus on literacy by Crew
and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani _ dropped most of all, in both reading
and math.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he was ``very alarmed and concerned,'' Giuliani renewed
his call for radical reform of the system, including abolishing the
semi-independent Board of Education and placing the schools
directly under the mayor's control.
</P>
<P>
   But he stopped short of blaming Crew, saying the chancellor had
``done a very good job within a system that is totally
nonfunctional.''  &QL;

 NEW YORK: the court.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before he was taken into custody, Schwarz appeared to be glaring
at the federal prosecutors in the case and his reaction to the
verdict was one of ``disbelief, shock, rage,'' according to his
lawyer, Stephen Worth, who promised to appeal. Schwarz was taken to
the Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the grounds for the appeal, Worth said, would be that
the case was tainted by the dramatic confession of Volpe. In that
confession, which occurred outside the presence of the jury, Volpe
did not implicate any other officer by name.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe confessed to torturing Louima only after a parade of other
police officers testified that they saw him in the 70th Precinct
station house brandishing a feces-stained stick that he used to
brutalize Louima and bragging about how he had humiliated him.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe's plea on May 25, after three weeks of testimony,
fundamentally changed the landscape of the trial, removing the
principal defendant and changing the focus of a prosecution that
had massed its artillery on him. The case against the four other
defendants was less substantial. It took only two days after
Volpe's plea for the prosecution to conclude its case.
</P>
<P>
   None of the officers testified in his own defense, and neither
the prosecution nor the defense lawyers called Volpe to testify
after his guilty plea, saying his testimony was not believable.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz, along with Bruder and Wiese, was also accused of
beating Louima in a patrol car while transporting him from a street
brawl to Brooklyn's 70th Precinct station house. All three were
acquitted of those charges. Volpe earlier admitted that he
assaulted Louima in the police car.
</P>
<P>
   Wiese, Schwarz and Bruder still face charges of conspiring to
obstruct justice by misleading investigators as to Schwarz's role
in the bathroom torture.
</P>
<P>
   Bellomo was also acquitted of trying to cover up the beating of
Louima in the car and of a separate assault by Volpe on a second
Haitian immigrant, Patrick Antoine, 38.
</P>
<P>
   The cases against Schwarz, Bruder and Wiese, who had been free
on $100,000 bail each since their indictments last year, were
largely circumstantial and less solid than the case against Volpe,
though the evidence against Schwarz appeared stronger than that
against Wiese and Bruder.
</P>
<P>
   Marvyn Kornberg, Volpe's lawyer, said that the jury wrongly
convicted Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really disappointed in the fact that Officer Schwarz
was convicted,'' said Kornberg, adding that, on Volpe's behalf, he
had ``advised the prosecutors that the other officer in the
bathroom was not Officer Schwarz but, in fact, another officer
whose name was given to them at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked by a reporter who that officer was, Kornberg refused to
divulge a name. Federal prosecutors angrily dismissed Kornberg's
credibility.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I dare say that neither Volpe nor his attorney have any
credibility with respect to any factual issue touching on this
case, including the identity of the other officer or officers with
him,'' said Vinegrad, referring to Kornberg's opening argument in
the trial.
</P>
<P>
   In that argument, Kornberg suggested that Louima had suffered
his internal injuries _ a torn rectum and bladder _ in a consensual
sexual encounter with another man. Because of Volpe's guilty plea,
Kornberg did not have the opportunity to present any evidence or
witnesses to bolster such a claim.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe's crime and Kornberg's behavior in the trial also drew
criticism from a lawyer representing Wiese. Joseph Tacopina said
that the ``stench'' of Volpe's crime and the ``outlandish,
outrageous theories'' of Kornberg, damaged all the defendants in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Several days before Volpe pleaded guilty and threw himself on
the mercy of the court, he tried to make a plea deal with the
prosecutors. He reportedly told prosecutors what Kornberg announced
Tuesday _ that Schwarz was not the other officer in the bathroom.
But prosecutors refused to make a plea deal.
</P>
<P>
   When Volpe pleaded guilty, he said ``there was another police
officer in the bathroom with me'' but ``that police officer saw
what was going on did nothing to stop it.'' He did not identify the
officer.
</P>
<P>
   While Volpe and Kornberg have not said publicly who the second
officer was, it appeared from court documents that he was referring
to Wiese, who told investigators that he walked into the bathroom
after the assault.
</P>
<P>
   In the first days after the 1997 attack on Louima, Wiese, in an
unsuccessful effort to make his own deal, said he walked into the
bathroom after Volpe had attacked Louima with the stick, according
to the documents. He said there was no other officer there.
Investigators said he failed a lie detector test, and as a result
no deal was made with him. His lawyer said he passed a later test.
</P>
<P>
   In the case against Schwarz, Louima could not identify the
officer who he said held him down during Volpe's attack in the
bathroom, but he said it was done by the same officer who had
driven him to the station. Police records indicate that Schwarz was
the driver.
</P>
<P>
   Two policemen gave major testimony against Schwarz. Detective
Eric Turetzky and Officer Mark Schofield said they saw him walk
Louima, handcuffed and with his pants down, from station house desk
where he was booked on assault charges _later dropped _ directly to
the bathroom area.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for Schwarz, Worth, who vigorously cross-examined
these witnesses, insisted that his client was never in the bathroom
with Louima and that Louima was mistaken in asserting that it was
the driver of the car who held him down. He emphasized that
Turetzky and Schofield had said they saw Schwarz taking Louima
toward the bathroom, but not into it.

<P>
   Q. How high do the various flying creatures (birds, bats, bugs)
fly?

<P>

(begin ital) The jet above the Ivory Coast
</P>
<P>
   Was seven miles high
</P>
<P>
   As the Rupell's Griffon Vulture rode
</P>
<P>
   the thermals in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The plane collided with the bird
</P>
<P>
   The vulture was no more
</P>
<P>
   But now we know how high they go
</P>
<P>
   The heights to which birds soar. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   A. And then there was mountain climber L.W. Swan, who heard the
barheaded goose at 28,000 feet on the Himalayan peak Mt. Makalu. Or
the alpine chough (as in that was one tough bird) that followed a
1924 Mt. Everest expedition up to 26,000 feet scavenging food from
their camp.
</P>
<P>
   But those are the oddities in the avian record books. Common
birds like warblers, thrushes, and shore birds commonly fly at 10
to 20,000 feet, according to Simon Perkins, field ornithologist for
the Massachusetts Audubon Society. But they're not up there just
for the view. They go to those heights to migrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes too much energy to get up to greater altitudes if
they're only going to come right back down,'' Perkins says. ``At
higher altitudes the air is more stable, which makes for easier
flying. It's worth it for them to do the work to get up into that
stable air for their long migratory flights. It is a trade off
though, because the air is thinner, which requires them to work
harder.''
</P>
<P>
   But birds are such efficient fliers, he says, that they use very
little oxygen, so even the oxygen-poor air at higher altitudes has
enough to keep them going. Many birds migrate at night, Perkins
adds, because night air is more stable than daytime air being
warmed and stirred up by the heat of the sun.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) The free-tailed bat of Mexico
</P>
<P>
   spends summer nights quite high.
</P>
<P>
   In search of buggy dinners

</P>
<P>
   Tom Kunz of Boston University, a Professor of Biology and
world-renowned expert on the 1,000 species of Chiroptera, (bats
make up one quarter of all mammals) is about to head to the 15
caves in southern Texas that each house between seven and 20
million Mexican free-tailed bats. He says radar has seen these
flying mammals at 10,000 feet feeding on insects carried that high
by thermal air currents.
</P>
<P>
   Kunz says stray bats have been at higher altitudes including
some specimens found 16,000 feet up in the Andes mountains.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) Cold-blooded bugs that flap their wings
</P>
<P>
   Need warmish air to fly
</P>
<P>
   Without it they will crash right down
</P>
<P>
   and some will even die.
</P>
<P>
   The chill above 6000 feet
</P>
<P>
   Is just too cold to take
</P>
<P>
   To try and fly much higher
</P>
<P>
   Is a flying bug's mistake. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Elson Shields, Entomologist at Cornell University, uses
radio controlled planes towing nets to collect bugs at various
altitudes. He says they need air that's at least 50 degrees
Fahrenheit to warm them enough so they can use the muscles that
keep their wings extended. Cooler than that and bugs can't even
float along like a glider. The wings retract and down they come.
Shields says 6,000 feet is the highest anyone has ever found bugs
buzzing around.
</P>
<P>
   Of course insects reach much greater heights. Non-flying species
like spiders and caterpillar larvae fly by spinning long silk
strands that are picked up in the wind and carry the little
creatures like parasails. Strong updrafts can carry them miles
high. In some cases, they freeze to death. Sometimes they come back
down and thaw out just in time. Shields says their light weight and
strong exoskeleton that forms the outer shell of their bodies
protect them from death after falling from such altitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Shields says that many winged insects are experts at using the
wind to help them fly. One fascinating example is the potato leaf
hopper, a bug just one sixteenth of an inch long, that migrates
between Georgia and New York. It apparently can sense changes in
barometric pressure that occur at the beginning of stormy weather.
The tiny leaf hoppers launch themselves into the storm front and
can make their thousand-mile journey flapping along with the help
of hundred mile an hour winds in just 36 hours.

ERSTAD TRIES TO GET PAST SLUMP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANFRANCISCO _ Monday night, left fielder Darin Erstad went 0
for 5 and stranded six runners on base, including four in scoring
position.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday afternoon, Erstad found himself on the bench during the
Angels' game against the Giants. Erstad, whose batting average has
fallen to .227, had played in every inning of every game before
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not OK with it,'' Erstad said about sitting the bench.
``But I'm not helping the team. (Manager Terry Collins) has got to
put someone in who can help the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad is known as one of the Angels' most intense players. Last
year at this time he was on his way to being named an American
League All-Star, so struggling as he is now has him beating his
head against the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' he said. ``I pride myself in hitting, I've
been doing it my whole life. To not do it is confusing. I expect
success. I expect to play hard every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say I'm hard on myself, but it drives me to be better.
For whatever reason, it's not working.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said it wasn't an easy decision to sit Erstad down.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got enough guys out of the lineup now, it's hard
to take out one of your key players,'' said Collins, who chatted
privately with Erstad in the Angels' dugout for 10 minutes while
the rest of the team stretched before Tuesday's game. ``But he
needs a break. . . . He needs a day to relax a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad said he's tried everything to break out of his slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to relax, stay more relaxed,'' he said. ``I've tried
to do a lot of different things. I'm just not pressing the right
buttons.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Fastballs and bruises: Randy Velarde had a baseball-sized
bruise on the left side of his rib cage, which makes sense _ he was
hit there by a 95-mph fastball thrown by Jerry Spradlin Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Sandy) Koufax one day put a guy out for a month when he hit
him with a fastball in the ribs,'' Collins said. ``That's the first
thing I thought about last night when Randy got hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury problem stretches beyond the players in the
organization. Strength-and-conditioning coach Brian Grapes sported
a black and blue right eye Tuesday one day after getting hit by a
stray ball during batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Greene, who caught Tuesday despite a sore right hamstring,
sore right ankle and sore right shoulder, pointed to the word
``Angels'' on his uniform and said: ``Freaky things happen to those
who wear that on their chest.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Gary DiSarcina will have his left forearm X-rayed
today and if the bone has healed as expected, he'll begin a rehab
assignment soon. DiSarcina said he'd like to begin a rehab
assignment Thursday if the X-rays are clean. . . . Angels Spanish
broadcaster Jose Tolentino, a left-hander, throws batting practice
on days the Angels face a left-handed pitcher. Including Tuesday's
loss against Giants lefty Shawn Estes, the Angels are 6-3 on days
when Tolentino throws batting practice.

LOSING TOUCH: RELIANCE ON STETHOSCOPE WANES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nothing is more symbolic of the doctor's art than the
stethoscope; one physician-writer even likens it to a therapeutic
``umbilical cord'' that represents the intimate bond between the
doctor and patient.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, nearly 200 years after its invention, the stethoscope is
losing its once preeminent place as a diagnostic tool to more
accurate, though costly, high-tech tests like the echocardiogram
and CT scan.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians still, of course, carry their stethoscopes like a
badge of honor, draped around their necks. But compared to their
elders, today's young doctors have proven less skilled at detecting
and interpreting the faint whooshes and clicks of a sick heart.
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that's just technological evolution: what's the point
of making such an effort to learn the subtleties of ausculation
(listening to heart sounds) when there's an ultrasound test
(echocardiogram) that shows the beating heart and its glitches in a
detailed, computerized image?
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of the stethoscope say this new attitude leads to the
overuse of costly tests. Beyond this, these critics feel that those
who accept the ``death of the stethoscope'' are part of a
disheartening trend in which doctors are becoming remote, less of
the ``hands-on'' healers who listened not only to their patients'
bodies but their thoughts and fears as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that it's an enormous problem and a huge amount is
being lost,'' says Dr. William Silen, a veteran surgeon and
renowned diagnostician who is Dean for Faculty Development and
Diversity at Harvard Medical School. Silen contends that with his
hands and ears he could render just as accurate a diagnosis of
abdominal pain (his specialty) as a CT scan could _ and do it more
cheaply. In fact, it is wrong-headed cost cutting by managed care
companies, says Silen, that's responsible for declining hands-on
competence. ``(Doctors) are not acquiring the skills in history
taking and physical examination because they're not given the time
to do these things,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has prompted a re-examination of the training of new
doctors. Some medical schools, including Harvard's, have expanded
their training in the use of stethoscopes and other hands-on
methods of diagnoses. To help the less aurally gifted, one company
has just introduced an electronic stethoscope that amplifies heart
sounds 14 times and filters out unimportant noise. The
Hewlett-Packard Stethos, ``has lots of advantages'' over the
traditional type, says Dr. Julian Aroesty, a cardiologist at Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center who recently tried it out, ``except
that it's more expensive'' at about $350 vs. $50 to $100 for a
traditional model.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors and medical educators argue that expert abilities
in using the stethoscope and tapping and feeling different parts of
the body may not be quite as crucial  &UR; today &LR;  as in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I trained as an intern in 1963 and 1964, that's what we
spent our time doing with patients _ listening to their story and
listening to their heart,'' says Dr. Marshall Wolf, vice chairman
for medical education at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We listened because we didn't have that much therapy _ we
couldn't fix the blood vessels or operate on the heart'' to the
extent now possible.
</P>
<P>
   While  &UR; today &LR; 's young doctors can't hear all the fine points of
heart sounds, Wolf adds, ``they have a different set of skills:
they know a lot of things that people of my generation never
dreamed of'' and which may be more important to the patient's
outcome _ especially very sick patients in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wolf says, the ability to perform a physical exam and use
a stethoscope are important for doctors who see relatively healthy
patients and need to screen them for hidden health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Aroesty, who calls auscultation with the stethoscope ``a dying
art,'' says it's a skill ``that has been lost in part because it's
not needed as much as it was before _ the same reason kids  &UR; today &LR; 
can't add and subtract because they all have hand calculators.''
The doctors' version of hand calculators include the
echocardiogram, CT, and MRI tests that create computerized pictures
of normal and abnormal structures of the body.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have been bemoaning the erosion of physical exam and
auscultation skills since the 1980s, but the most urgent wakeup
call came in September 1997, when the Journal of the American
Medical Association published the results of a test of stethoscope
skills.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers led by Dr. Salvatore Mangione at the Allegheny
University of the Health Sciences played recordings of heart sounds
representing 12 different abnormalities, and asked 453 resident
physicians and medical students to identify them.
</P>
<P>
   On average, the internal medicine and family practice physicians
correctly identified only 20 percent of the heart problems, which
wasn't significantly better than the medical students. The
researchers called this accuracy rate ``disturbingly low'' and
raised concerns that this was also true of other ``bedside
diagnostic skills.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate has been raging ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Those who deplore the trend argue not so much that patient care
is suffering, but that it's costing the health care system millions
of dollars in needless, expensive echocardiograms and other tests.
Skillful use of the stethoscope ``is the most cost-effective way to
determine what's the next test'' a patient should have, contends
Dr. Robert J. Adolphe, a semi-retired cardiologist at the
University of Cincinnati who wrote an editorial in the journal
Chest last year titled ``In Defense of the Stethoscope.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that those of us who know how to use a
stethoscope are (virtually) gone,'' says Adolph. ``I'm not sure
that there are going to be any teachers around'' to train the next
generation, he adds, ``and I think it's a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Although doctors had for centuries pressed their ears to
patients' bodies as a crude diagnostic method, the first
stethoscope is credited to the French doctor Rene Laennec who, in
1816, rolled paper into a tube that relayed the sound to his ear.
History books say that Laennec's invention stemmed from his
uneasiness about placing his ear directly on a woman patient's
chest.
</P>
<P>
   The familiar stethoscope with its rubber tube, metal listening
part, and earpieces, has changed little in recent decades while
serving as the workhorse of diagnosis _ and not just for the heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use my stethoscope every time I walk in to see a patient,''
says Dr. Ellen Rothman, a resident in pediatrics at Children's
Hospital in Boston. ``I listen to the heart, the lungs, and the
belly _ it's a great screening tool.'' She adds that young children
frequently have respiratory symptoms, and Rothman and other doctors
emphasize that even if the stethoscope became outdated for cardiac
diagnoses, it would have full employment for use in detecting fluid
in the lungs, wheezing, and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1970s, when computerized images using ultrasound
technology became available, listening to the sounds of the heart
was the only noninvasive way to detect and identify different heart
problems. And it took lots of training and experience.
</P>
<P>
   As one author notes, it calls for identifying ``sounds that are
at the threshold of audibility and are packed into a very short
time interval,'' sometimes just fractions of a second. Studies have
shown that doctors who are trained musicians do better at
auscultation.
</P>
<P>
   An expert at the skill can detect quite a list of conditions by
identifying characteristic sounds, known as murmurs, clicks,
rumbles, snaps, gallops, and rubs. The sounds are emitted by blood
flowing over and through deformed or leaky valves, or by extra or
mistimed openings and shuttings of valves.
</P>
<P>
   For some of the critics, the fading of stethoscope skills
sharply reflects the downgrading of hands-on medicine, which may in
itself, in some intangible way, help patients get better. Dr.
Michael Kirsch, a physician in Highland Heights, Ohio, who compares
the stethoscope to an umbilical cord, says that technology is one
of the forces that are driving doctors and patients apart. ``This
is a complaint I hear a lot _ patients say, `All I'm getting are
tests and prescriptions','' says Kirsch.
</P>
<P>
   The concerns are not lost on medical educators. ``There's no
doubt that the average young physician's skills'' in examining
patients ``are not going to be what the best clinicians had several
decades ago,'' says Dr. Paul Wang, an attending cardiologist at New
England Medical Center who teaches at Tufts University School of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   At Tufts, training in physical exam skills is now being started
earlier. And there's a conscious effort to teach doctors how to
build a rapport with patients, Wang says.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Armstrong, director of medical education at Harvard
Medical School, says Harvard has been bolstering the teaching of
basic hands-on skills for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   As early as the first year of medical school, she says, students
are ``learning to speak with patients and capture their story, and
learn many of these qualities you're looking for in your doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   Stethoscope and other physical exam skills are receiving more
attention and time, adds Armstrong. And, she said, students will
have to demonstrate that they are competent in these skills by
taking a new practical exam that's going to launched later this
year.

ANNE SHEAFE MILLER, 90, FIRST PATIENT SAVED BY PENICILLIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)   (bl)  
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anne Sheafe Miller, who made medical history as the first
patient ever saved by penicillin, died May 27 in Salisbury, Conn.
She was 90.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1942, Mrs. Miller was near death at New Haven Hospital
in New Haven, Conn., suffering from a streptococcal infection, a
common cause of death then. She had been hospitalized for a month,
often delirious, with her temperature spiking to nearly 107, while
doctors tried everything available, including sulfa drugs, blood
transfusions and surgery. All failed.
</P>
<P>
   As she slipped in and out of consciousness, her desperate
doctors obtained a tiny amount of what was still an obscure,
experimental drug and injected her with it. Her hospital chart, now
at the Smithsonian Institution, registered a sharp overnight drop
in temperature, and by the next day she was no longer delirious and
soon was eating full meals, one of her doctors reported.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Miller's life was saved, and so eventually were the lives
of all those previously felled by bacteria infections like
streptococci, staphylococci and pneumococci. Penicillin also saved
the lives of an untold number of servicemen and civilians wounded
in World War II; in earlier wars, people died by the thousands from
bacterial infections resulting from their injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sir Alexander Fleming, the Scottish biologist, was the
first to recognize the therapeutic potential of penicillin through
a chance discovery at St. Mary's Hospital in London in 1928, nearly
a dozen years passed before scientists fully appreciated its
significance and were able to produce it for experimental use in
humans.
</P>
<P>
   Largely forgotten, it came to the fore only when researchers
picked up on it again at Oxford University at the outbreak of World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   Before Mrs. Miller's doctors succeeded in saving her life, only
a few experiments had been conducted with penicillin in mice and
people, with results mixed and largely disheartening.
</P>
<P>
   The small quantity of penicillin rushed to New Haven came from a
laboratory in New Jersey, and news of Mrs. Miller's full, seemingly
miraculous recovery helped inspire the American pharmaceutical
industry to begin full production of penicillin.
</P>
<P>
   A native New Yorker, Mrs. Miller graduated in 1931 from Columbia
Presbyterian School of Nursing, now part of Columbia University.
The next year, she married Ogden D. Miller, a Yale University
administrator. The family moved to Washington, Conn., in 1945, when
Miller became headmaster of the Gunnery School, where he served
until he retired in 1969. He died nine years later, and Mrs. Miller
remained in Washington until 1996, when she moved to a retirement
community in Salisbury.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by three sons, Ogden D. Jr., of Vienna, Va.,
David P., of Darlington, Md., and Dwight D., of Watertown, Mass.; a
brother, Theodore H. Sheafe of Tigard, Ore.; a sister, Mary S.
Jewett of Lyme, Conn.; six grandchildren, and seven
great-grandchildren.

   Moreover, Worth pointed out that the first police investigator
who spoke to Louima, at Coney Island Hospital a day and a half
after he was attacked, testified that Louima told him he had been
placed in a cell for 10 minutes between the time he was booked at
the station desk and when he was taken into the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Worth called this a crucial contradiction of Louima's later
accounts, and his trial testimony, that he had been taken directly
from the desk to the bathroom. The lawyer also said it called into
question the testimony of the officers who said Louima was taken
straight to the bathroom area.
</P>
<P>
   He also accused the prosecution of improperly hiding the account
by the investigator, Sgt. William Hargrove, until nearly the end of
the trial. Prosecutors denied this, and dismissed the account of
the 10-minute interval in the cell, saying that Louima had been
``under heavy medication'' during the hospital interview. They
insisted that the rest of his account was consistent.
</P>
<P>
   Asked repeatedly after the verdict if a third officer might have
been in the bathroom with Volpe and Schwarz when Louima was
brutalized, Carter said he would not respond because ``that is
going to be the subject matter of the next trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney said that Schwarz, Bruder and Wiese will be
tried for obstruction of justice in connection with charges that
they invented a phony story about what occurred in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   As for the acquittal of the three officers of beating Louima,
Carter said he was disappointed but not surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has historically been difficult to obtain convictions in
assault cases where there are allegations of assaults by police
officers, where the only witnesses to the assaults are the victims
themselves and the police officers,'' Carter said.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, June 9:
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Zachary Carter said it best Tuesday as he stood
outside the Brooklyn federal courthouse and assessed the latest
verdicts in the Abner Louima case. The most important lesson that
New York City police should learn from the Louima trial, he said,
is that their ``worst betrayal'' is not testifying against a fellow
officer. It is betraying their oath of office out of ``a false
loyalty'' to colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's case was bolstered dramatically in May by a series of
police officers who broke the old code of silence and testified
against officer Justin Volpe. After having protested his innocence
for months, Volpe then confessed to sodomizing Louima with a stick
in a police precinct house bathroom. A federal jury in Brooklyn on
Tuesday convicted Charles Schwarz as the officer who held Louima
down in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   While the same jury acquitted three other officers on charges of
beating Louima in a squad car and lying to the FBI, the verdicts do
not end the court action in the Louima case. Nor should these
acquittals close this matter within the Police Department, where
internal investigators are expected to judge the conduct of these
officers and others as well.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz and two other defendants, Officers Thomas Wiese and
Thomas Bruder, still face court charges of obstructing justice,
allegations that they deny. Carter said the three were accused of
``offering an alternative and false scenario about what went on in
that bathroom.'' Thus this next trial will focus even more clearly
on the issue of whether the officers tried to cover up the Louima
attack during the investigation that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, it could help destroy the code of secrecy
to the benefit not only of the Police Department brass but also of
those honorable officers who have long chafed at the unwritten
rules that require silence. The Louima case brings home the old
warning that silence about a bad police officer can make trouble
for the entire department.

ON BASKETBALL: THE ABSENCE SPEAKS LOUDER THAN LOSING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As strategies go, Jeff Van Gundy has come up with
better ones than starting Latrell Sprewell. The New York Knicks'
coach was predictably weathering the usual criticism and
second-guessing Tuesday for not staying with his bigger lineup in
Game 4, as if a dynasty featuring Kurt Thomas at power forward was
suddenly in danger of crumbling.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell failed to energize the offense and the Knicks gave up
home-court advantage in the Eastern Conference finals Monday night.
But Van Gundy's decision on Sprewell had little do with why the
Indiana Pacers will most likely wake the No. 8-seeded Knicks from
their sweet NBA finals dream.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' problem is not that Sprewell's name was announced
during player introductions Monday night. The problem is that
Patrick Ewing's name was not.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing has been out only two games, and the Knicks already miss
his defensive rebounding and his go-to savvy in the fourth quarter.
Everyone has an occasional rotten night in this league. Yet if you
watched closely enough on Monday, you would swear that Sprewell,
Allan Houston and Larry Johnson took turns not wanting the ball at
the end.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, the National Basketball Association playoffs
are about matchups. Who can guard whom and who cannot. Who is
quicker and who is bigger. By not allowing them to run the break on
offense, the Pacers have neutralized Sprewell and Houston, the two
best offensive weapons the Knicks have now.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Camby's elongated, 7-foot frame aside, the Knicks have
not nullified Indiana's size advantage. The Knicks were
outrebounded, 41-30, in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   There is a reason Dale Davis and Antonio Davis were able to
defend and help out on Johnson on Monday; they don't have to help
double-team a 7-foot scoring threat in the post. There is a reason
Camby's face and corn-silk-thin body contort when he is called for
a questionable foul; as a young, still unproven player, he gets
little respect from the officials.
</P>
<P>
   Cold-but-true NBA playoff fact: if Ewing gets plowed into by
Antonio Davis at the end of Game 2, an offensive foul is probably
called instead of the block on Camby. At any rate, as this
entertaining series heads for perhaps a seventh game in
Indianapolis on Sunday, so, too, does the Patrick Redemption Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ewing, his supporters are stubborn. They sometimes utter
their drivel about why the Knicks can't win without him based only
on their resentment toward the Patrick-Must-Go faction. John
Thompson, a devout member of that fraternity, said last week how
much Ewing will be missed when he is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Bias and all, Thompson was right. There will be something sad
about the Knicks' finally going down and not being able to have a
shot at winning that elusive championship ring for their franchise
center.
</P>
<P>
   It says something about Ewing's career in New York that he may
eventually be accorded more respect with his injured left foot in a
walking boot on the sideline than when he played gallantly on the
floor to help get this team this far.
</P>
<P>
   During the fourth quarter of Game 4, the overhead scoreboard
honed in on a fan holding up a sign that read ``Do It for Ewing.''
There was a smattering of applause, but after the initial rush no
one bothered to put their hands together.
</P>
<P>
   Few times in American sports history has there been a prominent
superstar so disconnected from the people and the city he plays in.
That lack of public affection is mostly Ewing's fault. Private and
reclusive, he rarely avails himself to the people who paid and
clapped 14 seasons for him. Nor did he accommodate in any
substantive way a news media contingent that could have been his
conduit to the public.
</P>
<P>
   There have been numerous appearances in the name of charity and
many genuine moments with sickly, wide-eyed children in the locker
room after games. But there was no real mutual love, the comforting
feeling that he and New York were hitched _ for better or worse
until retirement did them part.
</P>
<P>
   Only now, in repose, do you get snippets of Ewing's personal
feelings on matters of importance. He jokes so often about being
traded in the off season, you almost wonder if he is fed up with
the franchise to a point that he might try to force the Knicks to
explore deals for him.
</P>
<P>
   His figurehead role in the lockout engendered more vitriol
against him than almost any of his last-second missed shots. His
major crime, at age 36, was reporting to training camp too heavy
and out of condition. He can be stubborn, fussy and as selfish as
any career-driven person making a lot of money in this city. Ewing
indeed gives you a litany of reasons it is hard to identify with
him on a regular-guy level.
</P>
<P>
   But not once he takes the court. This season he did that as a
shell of the player who once dominated in the middle. Battered body
and all, you saw the best of Ewing these last two months. Not just
the skill to break down a younger, stronger player inside, but the
grit to keep playing on through the injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were underdogs to begin with, and they don't go on to
lose the series because Sprewell starts or comes off the bench.
They may have lost to the Pacers when the results of that magnetic
resonance imaging test showed a partial tear in the left Achilles'
tendon of Patrick Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   Cold-but-true fact: the Knicks can't win it without him.

MLS IDEA: CAMPOS WITH L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Major League Soccer is not without its gimmicks or quick fixes,
but its latest offer has the Galaxy thinking carefully before
deciding its next move.
</P>
<P>
   It could be just what the Galaxy needs. On the other hand, it
could be just like the disruptive headache of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican scoring champion Carlos Hermosillo arrived Tuesday from
Mexico and should help the Galaxy's scoring and sagging attendance
in time for Saturday's showdown with Chicago at the Rose Bowl. But
how much more exciting would it be if Jorge Campos were here, as
well? Not with Chicago, mind you, but back with the Galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, that's what MLS officials proposed to the
Galaxy this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a situation where, obviously, the league feels Jorge
would make an impact on the attendance in Los Angeles,'' said
Galaxy general manager Sergio Del Prado. ``We believe that to be
true also, but we wouldn't want to give up a foreign slot to get
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Campos hasn't had the best reputation in MLS but always has been
a crowd-pleaser. He was dealt by Los Angeles to Chicago before the
1998 season but left the Fire during the MLS playoffs to join his
Mexican team (Pumas). Because Zach Thornton proved more valuable
than Campos in the nets for the Fire, Campos decided to leave
rather than sit on the bench during the MLS playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   So what would happen if he returned to L.A? Do you start Campos
in goal and tell current keeper Kevin Hartman, who leads the MLS
with six shutouts, to sit on the bench? Do you start Campos on the
front line with Hermosillo? Or, does he simply come off the bench
and please the fans?
</P>
<P>
   ``If it happened, I don't see him replacing Kevin,'' Del Prado
said. ``He (Campos) scored seven goals in his last eight games with
Pumas. I'm sure he would be someone who played up front for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, it's a long shot at this point, but it is certainly
something we need to consider.''
</P>
<P>
   MLS executive vice president Ivan Gazidis said Campos will meet
with MLS officials today in Chicago to discuss his future. Gazidis
said Campos' return to L.A. is certainly possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Galaxy has benefited significantly from Jorge's presence
and personality in the past,'' Gazidis said. ``I think it is an
attractive and interesting place for him to be. But having said
that, no decision has been made on where he will play this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Del Prado doesn't want to give up a foreigner like
Simon Elliott or Roy Myers to obtain Campos, Gazidis is hoping the
Galaxy will explore the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy is averaging only 13,105 fans per game this season, a
big drop from the 23,776 it averaged in its first three seasons
combined.
</P>
<P>
   When Hermosillo arrived last season, 38,383 attended his MLS
debut. So what would a team of Hermosillo and Campos draw together?
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be quite a combination, wouldn't it?'' Gazidis said.
``Imagine scenarios where the two of them are strike partners. It
would be interesting to see and I'm sure people would want to pay
money to see that. But whether L.A.'s interested in that are
questions for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hermosillo, greeted by a few hundred fans and the sounds of
mariachi music at LAX on Tuesday, said Campos would be a welcome
addition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he does come,'' Hermosillo said. ``Those are the types
of players that bring a lot to any team. You're always looking to
improve your product.''
</P>
<P>
   With or without Campos, Hermosillo realizes this season is much
different than the one a year ago. Then, Los Angeles was 11-1 with
44 goals in the bank when he arrived. This season, the Galaxy is
6-6 with only eight goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great challenge, not only for me, but for all of us,''
Hermosillo said when asked if he feels like the savior. ``I'm not
coming here to mess with the chemistry; I'm coming to join my
teammates.''

BROWNBACK, SENATE COLLEAGUES SAY SUDANESE ATROCITIES MUST BE
STOPPED

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just back from a trip to famine-ridden Sudan, Sen.
Sam Brownback of Kansas said Tuesday that the United States needs
to press the Khartoum government to end the genocide and slavery of
its own people.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have arguably the worst human-rights situation in the
world in Sudan: 1.9 million killed over the last 10 years, 4
million internally displaced, with some of the most horrifying
suffering you can imagine,'' Brownback said. ``It needs to be
stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Brownback, a Republican member of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, said that during his brief trip to the east African
nation, he saw bombed-out hospitals and evidence that the
government was contributing to a famine by denying food aid to
needy parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan, which the State Department considers a terrorist nation,
has been embroiled in a civil war for 15 years. Rebels in the
south, who are largely black Christians and members of tribes, are
fighting the primarily Arab Muslim government.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International has branded the government's war on the
south as ``ethnic cleansing.'' The United Nations, relief agencies
and other groups have reported religious persecution, the
government bombing of civilians and an extensive slave trade.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Committee on Refugees reports that 10,000 southern
Sudanese are forced into slavery each month.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Donald Payne, a New Jersey Democrat, and Rep. Thomas
Tancredo, a Colorado Republican, accompanied Brownback to Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Payne called Sudan the ``unknown disaster.'' Trancredo said
Sudan ``makes Kosovo look like a Sunday school picnic.'' He said
U.S. national security is at risk because Sudan exports terrorism
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is considering legislation to formally condemn the
slave trade, impose an arms embargo on the Khartoum government and
increase American support for the relief efforts and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Brownback said members of Congress hope to meet soon with
President Clinton. Standing at the senator's side, exiled Sudanese
Catholic Bishop Macram Gassis said the situation has been allowed
to go on for too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of slavery, the issue of rape, the issue of the
destruction of the traditions and customs of an African ethnic
group is a reality,'' he said. ``Time has gone by while people are
discussing. Committees, subcommittees. Commissions, subcommissions.
And in the meantime, the people are dying.''

EDUCATION DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL HEADS LIST FOR SCHOOL
SUPERINTENDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PHILLIP O'CONNOR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A top-ranking official in the U.S. Department
of Education is a leading candidate to become Kansas City school
superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Pascal D. Forgione Jr., 54, commissioner of education
statistics, will leave the $120,000-a-year federal post this month
because the Clinton administration will not renominate him for a
four-year term. Forgione confirmed his interest in the Kansas City
job this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the community has a lot of reflecting to do on what
they need,'' Forgione said. ``I think there will be a lot of
conversations ahead of us, but I am very interested in looking for
an urban superintendency.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Board of Education has discussed raising the
salary for the next superintendent. The last person to hold the
job, Henry Williams, made about $200,000 a year in pay and
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Desegregation Monitoring Committee, which is
screening candidates, briefly discussed submitting only Forgione's
name to the school board, possibly as early as this week. The
school board will make the selection.
</P>
<P>
   But committee Chairman John Murphy said Tuesday the three-member
panel now hopes to submit at least three names, possibly next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy with the initial selection,'' Murphy said. ``Our
internal struggle now is to find three strongly qualified
candidates. Maybe we're being overly selective in our criteria, but
our desire is to get the very best candidates we can find so they
end up with an outstanding superintendent.''
</P>
<P>
   The monitoring committee says it continues to seek applicants
but has not ruled out reconsidering previously rejected candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is scheduled to meet privately today with the
school board to discuss the search. Some board members are angered
by its involvement and said they have not been kept informed.
</P>
<P>
   Some board members also want to find out why previous
candidates, including Phyllis Chase, interim chief administrator
for curriculum and instruction, were rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just a lot of confusion over this whole process,''
school board President John Rios said. ``We know nothing about the
person the DMC has selected at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Confirmed as an education commissioner in 1996, Forgione
oversees a federal agency with a $68 million budget and 116
employees. The National Center for Education Statistics collects,
analyzes and disseminates education data, including the National
Assessment of Educational Progress. The center also conducts
international comparisons of statistics, such as the Third
International Mathematics and Science Study.
</P>
<P>
   Education Secretary Richard Riley, in a news release, credited
Forgione with making the agency's complex data widely
understandable and more publicly accessible. He also credited
Forgione with making the collected information more relevant and
timely.
</P>
<P>
   Forgione called his work as commissioner a ``terrific journey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been able to communicate a vision and a commitment that
data are a federal role that can be an asset to states and
districts and this nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Forgione last week announced his resignation. Administration
officials told him they feared a confirmation fight because of his
failure to file his income tax returns in a timely way for eight
consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
   Forgione acknowledged he missed the filing deadline but said he
was always due a refund and violated no federal tax laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a technical mistake in not completing and getting my
refund back, but I had no idea that there would be this severe
consequence.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that he twice has passed FBI background checks and that
his tax situation did not arise during his Senate confirmation
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing in my background professionally that would
cause me any difficulty,'' he said. ``This is a private issue and
one I will certainly never let happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Other educators and former department officials contend the
administration is punishing Forgione for criticizing Vice President
Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made a campaign-style appearance at a news conference in
February to announce that national reading scores had improved.
Some House members called the appearance inappropriate and said the
results should have been released independently, and Forgione
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are supposed to be an independent statistical agency, and I
have called things the way I felt they needed to be called,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The advisory board that oversees Forgione's agency panned the
administration's move and called Forgione's departure a
``tremendous loss.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(The board) is deeply grateful for what Pat has accomplished
in his all-too-short tenure,'' Andrew C. Porter, chairman of the
Advisory Council on Education Statistics, said in a letter to
Riley. ``We advised you that he be retained, and we are
disappointed that he has not been.''
</P>
<P>
   Forgione said a move from the federal level to a school district
would take him back to his roots.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut native began his career as a U.S. history
teacher in a 3,000-student high school in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to school, earned two master's degrees and a
doctorate and took a series of jobs before returning home in the
late 1970s to Connecticut. He eventually rose to director of
research, evaluation and assessment for the state Education
Department.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1991, Forgione took over as Delaware's state
superintendent of public instruction, where he was credited with
starting large-scale reform of the state's 19 school districts. He
served until June 1996 when he was nominated for the federal post.
</P>
<P>
   In Delaware, Forgione oversaw an $18 million project to toughen
academic standards in hopes of improving student performance. It
included development of a new curriculum and new instructional
methods.
</P>
<P>
   Forgione has three grown sons and recently remarried.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur A. Benson II, lawyer for the plaintiff children in the
school desegregation case, spent an afternoon last week
interviewing Forgione in Washington and came away impressed. He
called Forgione the most capable superintendent candidate the
district has had in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very articulate, passionate person,'' Benson said.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, Forgione sees a district that is more
financially stable than most urban school systems. He also
considers the district small enough to enact reform that will bring
widespread improvement during his tenure. He considers the public
hungry for reform of its school system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity to give leadership in a caring and committed
community is something I would value,'' Forgione said. ``The key
for me is to find the right community that would have the
opportunities where I could exercise leadership and be a resource
to the board, the community and educators. At this moment I'm very
much open to that.''

FAIR PROMOTES ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Air pollution does a lot of things.
</P>
<P>
   It contributes to asthma. It converts some die-hard drivers into
walkers and carpoolers. And, perhaps strangest of all, it makes
allies out of environmental activists, corn farmers and carmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The varying agendas of those groups converged Tuesday at Way to
Go, an annual fair promoting alternative transportation that would
lower pollution and improve health.
</P>
<P>
   The fair offered employees from nearby corporations a chance to
view transportation options. Displays offered information from
transit agencies, ride-share groups, bicycle and pedestrian
associations, and others.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Bearly, a senior production planner for Hallmark Cards Inc.,
wandered through the fair with some co-workers to inspect the
ethanol-, propane- and electric-powered vehicles on display.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ethanol is definitely a good idea,'' Bearly said. ``I love
the idea, because (American farmers) produce the product. It also
gives the farmers something to do with their crops.''
</P>
<P>
   The alternative fuels benefit the region with an ethanol plant
under construction in St. Joseph, Mo., said Kevin Lickteig,
research and programs assistant for the Kansas Corn Growers
Association. Alternative fuels also reduce American dependence on
foreign oil, Lickteig said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the federal government already had 300
ethanol-powered fleet vehicles on Kansas City roads and that more
private fleets would use alternative fuels to meet federal
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Lickteig's organization showcased vehicles that could run on
either an ethanol fuel or regular gasoline. Dodge, Plymouth and
Chrysler minivans, as well as the Ford Taurus and the Ford Ranger,
can come from the manufacturer with this dual capacity at no extra
cost, Lickteig said. Honda also has a model with the ethanol
option.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two Goodyear representatives were on hand to answer
questions from motorists who wanted to retrofit their vehicles to
run on propane as well as gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Oades, owner of Goodyear service centers in Overland Park
and Kansas City, Kan., said alternative fuels would help improve
air quality and health _ an issue in which Oades has a special
interest. Oades said that two of his children had asthma and that
he believed their breathing ailment came from pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Guebara, who represented the American Lung Association,
said eight persons in the Kansas City region died of asthma in the
last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asthma is on the rise regionally as well as nationally,'' she
said. ``We've got to do something about the quality of air control,
or we're not going to attack the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's fair was coordinated by the Metropolitan Energy
Center, the Clean Cities Coalition, the Mid-America Regional
Council and Bridging the Gap.

 UNDATED: scientists believe.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENGINEERING STUDIES
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists and engineers have argued that fusion energy is
inherently impractical because a fusion reactor costing billions of
dollars would quickly wear out. The flood of very high-energy
neutrons produced by hydrogen fusion penetrates metal and disrupts
its crystalline structure, causing it to expand and become
dangerously brittle. If the neutron bombardment were to reach the
metal wall of a reactor's vacuum chamber, the entire chamber could
eventually collapse, destroying the reactor.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the latest reactor plans call for capturing the neutrons
in a metal ``blanket'' (probably made of lithium) surrounding the
hot plasma fuel. The neutrons would heat the blanket, and this heat
would be transferred to a steam boiler to power a conventional
turbine. The lithium blanket and some other internal components of
the reactor would wear out in a few years, but could be
periodically removed and replaced at relatively modest cost. The
main part of the reactor would be spared. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INERTIAL CONFINEMENT
</P>
<P>
   Besides compressing and igniting fusion fuel magnetically, the
fusion reactions could also be ignited by an implosion as in
hydrogen bombs.
</P>
<P>
   In an inertial confinement reactor, the mixture of deuterium and
tritium fuel is encapsulated as a thin frozen coating on the inside
of tiny plastic hollow spheres. For each shot, a sphere is encased
in a metal ``hohlraum,'' a chamber about the size of a pencil
eraser placed at the focus point of 192 powerful lasers.
</P>
<P>
   When the lasers hit the hohlraum, it emits a blast of X-rays
that vaporize and compress the fuel sphere it encloses, imploding
the sphere and raising the temperature of the fuel inside it to the
ignition point, 100 million degrees Celsius or so. During the brief
fusion reaction that ensues, the immense energy it produces is
absorbed by a surrounding metal ``blanket,'' which transfers heat
to a steam-powered electric generating plant.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the basis of the $1.2 billion National Ignition
Facility under construction at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory in California. Because experiments using the machine
will help to monitor the combat readiness of America's arsenal of
nuclear weapons, part of its financing comes from the Department of
Energy weapons program. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Z PINCH
</P>
<P>
   A variant of inertial confinement fusion called a ``Z pinch'' is
under development at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque,
N.M.
</P>
<P>
   This device would implode little thermonuclear fuel capsules
like those the Livermore laboratory is developing, but without
lasers. Instead, scientists have invented a cylindrical array of
very fine tungsten wires and a gigantic capacitor, a device that
can store and instantaneously discharge huge electric charges.
</P>
<P>
   When the Sandia capacitor is fired, it sends a current of 20
million amperes through the fine wires in the Z pinch, and the
wires are converted into super-hot plasma. The plasma is driven
inward upon itself by the huge magnetic field produced by the
sudden current. The collision of the imploding plasma generates a
gigantic X-ray pulse and this, it is hoped, can implode fuel
capsules to reach ignition.
</P>
<P>
   The Z pinch and a more powerful successor planned by Sandia, the
X-1, will not ignite a sustained reaction but should produce a
pulse of fusion.

<P>
   KEYTESVILLE, Mo. _ The Chariton County Jail staff had been
warned about Donnie Lee Fisher before his escape Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reinforced that he might be a danger,'' Sheriff Chris
Hughes said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher broke out of jail but was captured the next day nearby.
He was being held after escaping from a Georgia jail and getting
into a shootout with police in February in Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   Chariton County's jail in Keytesville is 5 years old and before
Sunday never had an escape. The prison holds 32 inmates and is
nearly full.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said his jail would add guards and install aluminum
safety wires in the exercise yard.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher had been transferred to the jail in a program in which
the county is paid to hold out-of-county inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Many counties take in inmates as a source of revenue. Their
counterparts often need relief because their jails are outdated,
crowded or closed. Chariton County receives $30 per day per inmate.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher was transferred from Randolph County.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, who was transferred Tuesday afternoon to the city jail
in Moberly, had become proficient at prison escapes.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 15 he and two other men hid in the back of a food
service van as it left the Georgia State Prison in Reidsville. They
then attacked the driver after the van was clear of the prison
fences.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher and Roy Kenneth Sanford, 30, fled to central Missouri.
Police tracked them to a trailer in Huntsville, where both were
arrested after the shootout. Five officers were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher was convicted in 1991 of kidnapping and robbery in
Pulaski County, Mo. In 1994, he began serving an eight-year
sentence in Georgia on kidnapping charges there.

STATE BOARD'S OPEN FORUM REFLECTS PASSIONS OVER CREATIONISM,
EVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. _ New science standards were not on the agenda, but
they were in the spotlight at the Kansas Board of Education meeting
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the 18 speakers at the meeting's hourlong forum
addressed the proposed standards, which would guide what Kansas
public school students learned and were tested on.
</P>
<P>
   A set of standards written by a state committee would establish
evolution as a cornerstone of science.
</P>
<P>
   A competing proposal advanced by conservative board member Steve
Abrams of Arkansas City would leave the decision to teach the
scientific theory to local school districts.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four persons who spoke in support of the Abrams proposal,
two were involved in writing it. Half of the 14 other speakers were
University of Kansas researchers and professors who urged the board
to accept the state committee's recommended standards.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Holloway of Shawnee, the 10-member board's chairwoman and
a conservative, has said she favors the Abrams proposal, but she
hopes to find consensus among her fellow board members, who are
split ideologically.
</P>
<P>
   The state board originally was to discuss and possibly vote on
the new standards this month, but the 27-member state committee of
science teachers and professors that wrote the document was told to
revise it.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is meeting today in Salina. Its next draft will be
presented at the board's July meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's standards would declare evolution one of five
concepts that unite all scientific disciplines; the Abrams proposal
would remove the emphasis on evolutionary theory and question its
validity.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's standards say a theory such as evolution paints
a big picture of how the natural world works. The Abrams proposal
casts that theory as conjecture, placing applied science above
theoretical science.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have accused the Abrams proposal of opening the door to
teaching biblical creationism in Kansas science classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Williams of Leon and his wife, Mary, helped write the Abrams
version. He told the board that the differences between the two
came down to a debate about critical thinking and good science.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Williams seconded her husband. She said the proposal she
helped write did not aim to teach creation but aimed to encourage
science students to seek the truth about everything, including
evolution. She said scientists had perpetuated evolutionary theory
by dismissing proof against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please don't allow teaching lies as truth, as the state
document proclaims,'' Mary Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   John Van Keppel, a Leawood resident and proponent of the
evolution-theory proposal, said courts had supported the teaching
of evolution and banned the teaching of creationism in science
classes.
</P>
<P>
   Other speakers focused on the importance of theoretical science.
</P>
<P>
   KU Professor Matthew Buechner told the board he was in the
middle of research seeking a cure for polycystic kidney disease.
His research revolves around roundworms, which do not have kidneys.
But they do have genes, as humans do. Buechner studies what happens
when the genes malfunction because of disease, and he hypothesizes
that the same thing happens in humans.
</P>
<P>
   In his case, Buechner said, that theory could translate into a
cure for an often fatal disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's increasingly important for children to understand we're
related to other species,'' Buechner said.
</P>
<P>
   As the board continued its meeting after the forum, some of the
speakers continued the debate in a hallway near the boardroom.
</P>
<P>
   On the board's agenda today is discussion of new standards for
government, economics, geography and history.

SPREWELL AND HOUSTON: DYSFUNCTION LOVES COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SELENA ROBERTS   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Once their insecurities with one another dissolved
near season's end, Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston of the New
York Knicks formed a happy couple on the court. It did not matter
if they liked the same music or shared the same barber, because
they had success in common.
</P>
<P>
   And that was the thread that tied them together through the
first round of the playoffs, and then the second. They were
communicating on the court, running side by side on the fast break
and finding the other when their own path was cut off.
</P>
<P>
   They made quite a pair until the Indiana Pacers began to come
between them in the Eastern Conference finals. For four games of
this four-of-seven-game series that stands even at two games apiece
heading into Game 5 on Wednesday night in Indiana, the Pacers have
used Reggie Miller like a stick for Houston to chase and have cut
off the lifeline to Sprewell's offense by nearly eliminating
fast-break opportunities. One has been run ragged, the other has
been foiled by Indiana's size in the halfcourt. Houston has been
listless on offense, while Sprewell has been lethargic on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Houston and Sprewell do not look so great together.
Their combined shooting percentage is hovering at a miserable 35.7
percent, their turnovers are up, and Sprewell, for one, has had
only five assists the entire series. He had none during his first
start of the playoffs in Monday's deflating 90-78 loss at Madison
Square Garden. So it seems the lack of cooperation and trust that
nearly caused the collapse of the Knicks at midseason has sprung up
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're used to playing together, using each other, driving and
kicking, but we kind of left each other out to dry,'' Houston said
after the dispiriting Game 4. ``We forced each other to play some
one on one.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, Sprewell lost the battle almost every time he
tried to post-up Chris Mullin or tried to score off the dribble. A
wagon wheel compared to the racing Sprewell, Mullin was thought to
be vulnerable. That was part of the reason coach Jeff Van Gundy
started Sprewell, wanting someone to go at Mullin. The problem was,
Mullin planted his body on Sprewell and shut him down in the
halfcourt.
</P>
<P>
   To make things worse, Sprewell seemed so flustered on offense,
it carried over to his defense. Mullin, who was cutting to the
basket and moving well without the ball, slipped right under
Sprewell's nose for layups. In transition, Sprewell got caught once
allowing Mullin _ a longtime 3-point threat _ to pull up and nail
one while he watched from six feet away. When Mullin was not
reminding Sprewell of the crafty nature he had as his teammate at
Golden State, the gangly Jalen Rose was taking a turn driving on
Sprewell and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get Allan and Latrell going,'' Van Gundy said. ``We
have to get Latrell going defensively as well.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not a one-time lapse for Sprewell. He has struggled
throughout the series at small forward, unable to combat the
Pacers' size. He needs the fast break as a stage for his speed. Of
his 24 field goals in this series, at least 10 of them have been on
the rare occasion that he has been able to run out on the break.
</P>
<P>
   But everything is tied together. If the Knicks cannot rebound
without Patrick Ewing, there is no outlet pass. If the Knicks do
not defend with aggression, they end up taking the ball out of the
basket.
</P>
<P>
   When that happens, Sprewell is left standing still, which is the
best way to dilute his impact. The Pacers saw how Miami and Atlanta
buckled under his speed. And they had a firsthand look in Game 1,
when the Knicks scored 22 points on the break. Since then, the
Pacers have resisted the urge to toss up 3-pointers _ which equal
long rebounds, and instant fast breaks _ and are sprinting back in
transition defense.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Van Gundy indicated that he intended to keep Sprewell in
the starting lineup for Game 5 with the hope that he will awaken
along with his team. ``I know this is the way we have to go to have
a chance to win the series,'' Van Gundy said. ``We're going to
stick with that. No matter who we start, we have to guard and
rebound. We didn't get it done in the staring lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston and Sprewell were the main culprits. In Game 1, it was
Ewing who delivered the game-deciding free throws. In Game 3, it
was a gallant performance by the miracle worker, Larry Johnson, who
delivered a 4-point play to save the Knicks despite the absence of
the injured Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the series tied, who will come through? Houston has
done it before _ it was he who sent up a last-second runner that
licked the rim, kissed the backboard and fell into the net to give
the Knicks their memorable Game 5 victory against Miami. But there
have been too many games in this series when Houston has been a
wallflower on offense.
</P>
<P>
   While he deserves credit for tracing the whip-like moves of
Miller _ with some help from the Knicks' big men stepping out to
greet the Pacers' dangerous star _ Houston has had little left on
offense. His jumpers look as flat as sneaker soles, and his moves
to the basket have been languid at times. Not that he agrees with
this pattern of play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in slumps,'' said Houston, who has shot 20 for
60 in the series. ``I don't ever believe in missing a shot. It's
not frustrating at all. I'm out there having fun. You miss shots,
you miss shots.''
</P>
<P>
   He seems earnest when he says fatigue is not a factor. But it
takes energy to chase Miller, and then more muscle to hold off Rose
when he comes into the game. Houston allowed Rose to put his head
down and go right at him in Game 4. If Rose was not driving on
Houston, he was posting him up or darting outside for open jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   Both Houston and Sprewell realize this is no time to revert back
to the dysfunction of the past. One or the other _ but preferably
both as far as the Knicks are concerned _ needs to rebound when
they can, get the stops that lead to the fast-break style they
thrive in and score in the face of fatigue and frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't win another game if we can't find a way for Latrell
and Allan to be more efficient,'' Van Gundy said. ``That's how it
is.'' &QL;

PACERS OVERCOME THE WORRY HABIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Mark Jackson was perched on the scorer's table,
throwing his head back and laughing. Chris Mullin lounged a few
feet away, his arms draped over the back of a chair.
</P>
<P>
   On the day after their momentum-swinging victory in Game 4
against the New York Knicks, the Indiana Pacers had the body
language of people who had just spent the weekend at a spa: all
loose limbs and inner glow.
</P>
<P>
   Gone were the bleary eyes from the sleepless night that followed
the loss in Game 3. Missing were the incessant questions about when
Reggie Miller might show up.
</P>
<P>
   Miller still hasn't, although Indiana beat New York, 90-78, to
tie the series at 2-2. Miller scored 12 points Monday night _ he
was 0 for 3 and in foul trouble in the first half _ but even that
did not matter Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Any concerns about Miller _ and just about anything else _ were
sloughed off by coach Larry Bird and his players in the wake of
their best performance of the series.
</P>
<P>
   With Game 5 at Market Square Arena on Wednesday night and some
of the magic dust brushed off the Knicks, it is clear the Pacers
think they escaped disaster in the first three games and finally,
by playing the way they are capable of, seized control of this
series again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mood shift is unbelievable,'' Rik Smits said. ``It worries
me. Before Game 4 you saw a lot of concentration. It was almost a
must-win situation. The attitude was different. Now the guys are a
little more relaxed. I think we're feeling confidence. We finally
had a better game than the first three games.''
</P>
<P>
   Smits didn't. He picked up two fouls in the first 30 seconds of
the game and played only 13 minutes. But his high spirits Tuesday
were indicative of the change in tone among the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Where there was dissonance Sunday _ with Bird challenging Miller
to grab the ball and the leadership role and Antonio Davis ruefully
ruminating on his foul that sprang Larry Johnson's 4-point miracle
to win Game 3 _ there was only sweet music Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers could afford to be magnanimous when asked whether
they thought putting Latrell Sprewell in the starting lineup was a
mistake. (If he had done well, Jackson said, Jeff Van Gundy would
have looked like a genius.)
</P>
<P>
   They were gracious when questioned about whether the
ineffectiveness of Sprewell and Allan Houston is because of bad
shooting or good defense. (It depends on whether you think Miller
is shooting poorly and being guarded well.)
</P>
<P>
   So swift was the transformation in the tone of this series that
the Pacers found themselves addressing how they would avoid
overconfidence now that they own the home-court advantage again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't relax at all,'' Miller said. ``If I'm New York, I'm
feeling pretty good about myself. Games 1 and 2, they played
particularly well here in our building and we didn't play too
well.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Bird, not one for mindless cheerleading, had trouble
with anything but plaudits, calling the Game 4 performance ``four
great quarters.'' Still worried about Miller, he was asked? ``He'll
break loose sooner or later,'' Bird said.
</P>
<P>
   With their angst shed, the Pacers were renewed and refreshed.
The stress that preceded Game 4 has been replaced by a sense that
the Pacers' course to the finals has been righted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel danger,'' said Jalen Rose, who had 19 points and
6 rebounds in Game 4. ``I feel we've got control of the series.
It's for us to go out there and take. I want them to be confident,
to understand we've got a chance to play for the world
championship. We're right at the door with the foot there. All
we've got to do is kick it in.''

EDITORIAL: NEW SHOWDOWN ON GUN CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, June 9:
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of reason to be skeptical about House Speaker
Dennis Hastert pledge in May to support ``common-sense'' gun
control legislation in the House. After all, the Republican
leadership has tried every technique to gut or block gun control in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, in a highly unusual parliamentary move, Hastert said he
would bypass the Judiciary Committee, where most Republicans are
hostile to gun control, and bring the legislation directly to the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   If the speaker really means to carry out his pledge, he needs to
allow open debate and constructive amendments from both sides of
the aisle. Given a chance, the House could improve on the Senate
bill approved in May.
</P>
<P>
   To keep his pledge to instill a new bipartisan spirit, however,
Hastert has to break with the radical right, beholden to the
National Rifle Association, and permit moderate Republicans to join
the emerging congressional majority favoring gun control. He should
make each vote a matter of conscience and not have Tom DeLay or
other leadership henchmen threatening lawmakers if they vote
against the wishes of the gun lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also have obligations. Their leader, Richard Gephardt,
has not always been enthusiastic about this issue. He is determined
to win back the House in the next election and fears that passing
stiff gun control laws might make it harder to win seats in the
South or rural areas. But he should realize that the Littleton
school massacre has changed the political climate and that there
are votes to be gained from leadership on gun control. This is no
time for Democrats to slacken their efforts to get the best
possible measure through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The bill approved by the Senate in May was already too modest,
but now the NRA wants to water down several provisions,
particularly the one requiring a three-day background check for
purchasers at gun shows. The bill to be introduced next week in the
House reflects their demand to reduce the check to 24 hours, too
little time to thoroughly peruse criminal records.
</P>
<P>
   The House should support the three-day check period, and reject
other efforts to weaken the bill. Lawmakers should also go beyond
the Senate and subject Internet gun sales to background checks, and
raise the age for the purchase of assault weapons and handguns from
18 to 21 years. The House must also be sure not to load the
legislation down with ``poison pill'' provisions designed to repel
Democratic votes, such as mandatory incarceration with adults for
some juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Hastert has let the right wing of his party call the
shots on campaign finance reform, the budget and Kosovo. But a
``new center'' for gun control has clearly emerged in Congress, and
it should be given a chance to pass legislation favored by the
overwhelming majority of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have a margin of only 11 votes in the House. As many
as 30 Democrats are said to be nervous about being targeted by the
gun lobby and may not vote for tough legislation. But as many as 50
to 60 Republicans are probably ready to vote with the majority of
the Democrats. If Hastert lets this group have its say, the whole
country can benefit.

DAVID SEIDNER, 42, FASHION PHOTOGRAPHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Calif.)   (bl)  
 By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Seidner, a photographer known for his highly stylized
fashion shots inspired by moments in art history, died June 6 at
his home in Miami Beach, Fla. He was 42.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was AIDS, said the lawyer for his estate, Herbert
Nass.
</P>
<P>
   Seidner, born in Los Angeles, was just 19 when his first cover
photograph was published in Paris. Two years later he had a one-man
show at La Remise du Parc in Paris, and the next year a solo show
at the Los Angeles Institute of Contemporary Art.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s he was under a contract with Yves Saint Laurent.
Later his photography was used in advertisements for Bill Blass,
Bergdorf Goodman, Revlon and L'Oreal. He contributed regularly to
the fashion pages of Vanity Fair, The New York Times Magazine,
Italian Vogue, French Vogue and Harper's Bazaar. In 1986 he was
commissioned by the Musee des Arts de la Mode in Paris to
photograph costumes from its collection. His signature imagery from
that period included photographic fragments, paint, shards of glass
and reflections. His influence then was the music of John Cage.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s Seidner, who had studied art history and literature
and liked to bring what he called a ``philosophical perspective''
to his work, came to be known for his photography based on
paintings and sculptures. He also photographed a number of artists.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 he had a show at the Robert Miller Gallery in Manhattan
that featured expressionless black-and-white portraits of artists,
including Louise Bourgeois, Eric Fischl, Jenny Holzer, Ellsworth
Kelly, Jeff Koons and Joan Mitchell, all made to look like Roman
portrait busts. Two years later Robert Miller showed Seidner's
photographs of the fronts and backs of male and female models posed
nude like classical statues.
</P>
<P>
   His fashion spreads often featured riffs on art. His last homage
to painting, for example, was a spread in Vanity Fair last winter:
he coiffed and powdered the models he was photographing until they
all looked as if they had walked right out of a John Singer Sargent
painting.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 20 years Seidner had a dozen solo exhibitions and
participated in group exhibitions at the Whitney Museum and the
Pompidou Center in Paris. Next year La Maison Europeenne de la
Photographie in Paris, which has 150 of Seidner's portraits, nudes
and fashion photographs in its permanent collection, will have a
retrospective of his works.
</P>
<P>
   Seidner, who was a contributing editor to the art magazine Bomb
and wrote for French Vogue, was also the author of a number of
books: ``David Seidner: Photographs,'' ``Le Theatre de la Mode,''
``Eiko and Coppola on Dracula,'' ``David Seidner Nudes'' and ``The
Face of Contemporary Art.''
</P>
<P>
   His most recent book, ``Lisa Fonssagrives: Three Decades of
Classic Fashion Photography'' (Vendome, 1997) was a collection of
100 pictures of Ms. Fonssagrives, the model, taken by 21 different
photographers, from Louise Dahl-Wolfe to Erwin Blumenfeld. His
forthcoming books include a catalog for his Paris retrospective and
a book of his photographs of artists' studios.
</P>
<P>
   Seidner, who had AIDS for 15 years, was a member of the board of
the Community Research Initiative on AIDS in New York. Beginning in
1993 his portraits of famous people living with AIDS were used in
an advertising campaign for AIDS research. But he was outspokenly
critical of certain kinds of AIDS activism.
</P>
<P>
   In The New Yorker in 1993 he wrote an article about the
significance of the red ribbon. Its function, he wrote, ``seems to
be to alleviate guilt through trickle-down awareness, to make
people feel comfortable without having to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Seidner is survived by his companion, Daniel Wenger of Manhattan
and Miami Beach; his mother, Ryna Seidner of Los Angeles; a sister,
Sheri Seidner Superfon of Culver City, Calif., and a brother,
Jaime, of Oakville, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Seidner's last year was a busy one. He was given the Eisenstaedt
Award for Portrait Photography by Life magazine and Columbia
University. And he finished a series of orchid portraits that were
featured in The New York Times Magazine on April 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only natural that after spending years in Paris
photographing dresses, I'd find myself in Florida photographing
orchids,'' he said of his last photographic venture. ``They're
nature's couture.''

 &HT;    Corporate sponsors would fund most of new Falcons facility
 &HT;    By Bill Torpy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Corporate sponsors, with their names prominently
interwoven onto the Atlanta Falcons ``experience'' at Stone
Mountain Park, would build most of the new $10 million-plus
football training facility being proposed there, those involved
with the negotiations said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly the trend to make these training facilities
destination stops,'' said Archie Ellis, vice president of
Knoxville, Tenn.-based Partners and Associates, which two years ago
put together a $13.5 million training facility for the Cincinnati
Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons met Tuesday to iron out details with representatives
from Partners and Silver Dollar City, the Branson, Mo., firm that
manages Stone Mountain Park's attractions.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons, who now train at a 20,000-square-foot facility in
Suwanee, Ga. in Gwinnett County, have signed a non-binding letter
of intent to build a 70,000-square-foot office complex and training
facility on 30 acres of an old airfield east of the mountain. But
team spokesman Aaron Salkin cautioned ``that this doesn't mean
everything is automatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, officials said Stone Mountain, with its 4 million annual
visitors, is heads above the six other sites where the Falcons have
looked. And if everything goes smoothly, park visitors could by
next summer take in Robert E. Lee as well as Falcon linebackers
hitting tackling dummies with the same $6 Stone Mountain parking
fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stone Mountain is Georgia's No. 1 attraction and is always
getting proposals _ golf courses, soccer villages, reproductions of
Stonehenge,'' laughed Curtis Branscome, chief executive of the
Stone Mountain Park Memorial Association, the governor-appointed
authority that oversees the park. ``This is a benefit to the park
because it's something additional for people to do there.''
</P>
<P>
   Branscome said the corporate sponsorships and naming rights
would enable Silver Dollar City to get loans to build the facility.
The Falcons would then lease the facility from the park.
</P>
<P>
   The extra patrons coming to Stone Mountain would increase
revenue for the park association, said Ned Stancliff, senior vice
president for Silver Dollar City. The contract between Silver
Dollar City and the park association specifies that 3 percent of
revenue raised beyond $9.6 million goes back to the park
association. Stancliff said the extra revenue would raise
additional sales tax for DeKalb County and the state.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, football training camps were built on
out-of-the-way pastures where players could shed off-season pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, instead of isolating themselves, you'll see more pro
teams building (facilities) onto other amenities,'' said Stancliff,
who used the terms ``unlimited potential'' and ``natural synergy''
while talking about the potential arrangement. He said the
arrangement would be not unlike the new Atlanta Braves spring
training facility at Disney World near Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Stancliff said the new facility probably would have bleachers
for fans to watch workouts, and he did not foresee ``any extra
charge'' other than the standard parking fee.
</P>
<P>
   There would be three training fields and an indoor training
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Other Falcons attractions, such as a hall of fame and a gift
shop, would be included.

 &HT;    Theaters to card youths
 &HT;    (ATTENTION: OHIO EDITORS)
 &HT;    By Meggen Lindsay
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Theater owners Tuesday agreed to demand
identification from young people entering R-rated movies _ a move
that some Dayton-area teens called silly, while parents said the
action was worth trying.
</P>
<P>
   The move drew the applause of President Clinton, who has been
pressing the theater owners on the issue of violence in movies.
</P>
<P>
   Some local theater owners said they think the burden for keeping
kids out of movies they shouldn't see ought to be up to parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my personal opinion that it is the parents'
responsibility, not my responsibility, as far as what their child
is or is not watching,'' said Phillip Chakeres, owner of Chakeres
Theatres in Kettering and Fairborn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's kind of stupid,'' said Dan Shisler, 18, of Huber
Heights. ``If you want to see a movie, you should be allowed to.
Teen-agers can handle that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton argued that children see too much violence in popular
entertainment, and that the typical American will see 40,000
dramatized murders by the age of 18. ``They're subject to too much
violence through media and cultural contacts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about the multiplex is that there's a movie
for every member of the family,'' Clinton said. ``But not every
movie is for every member of the family. When you drop them off,
you shouldn't have to worry about your G-rated kids getting into
violent or suggestive R-rated movies.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that ``too often children do get past the ticket counter
unescorted and underage.'' He said that with Tuesday's
announcement, ``The theater owners are clearly drawing the line.''
</P>
<P>
   The president launched the plan with the leaders of the National
Association of Theatre Owners, whom he had challenged May 15 to
strengthen its movie-rating enforcement. The association, which
represents about 20,000 screens _ 65 percent of the motion picture
screens in the United States _ said it will begin requiring photo
IDs for teen-agers at R-rated movies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's three-part plan also includes an educator outreach
program for parents about the rating system and support by theater
owners for a national study on the causes of violence.
</P>
<P>
   The president also challenged the movie industry to reevaluate
its PG-13 rating to determine if it allowed too much violence in
movies that young children may see without a parent. The
association also asked theater owners to post notices reflecting
the R-rated admissions policy.
</P>
<P>
   In conjunction with movie enforcement, the president repeated
his call on Congress to pass common-sense gun legislation, and
urged the video-game, recording, and movie industries not to market
violence to children.
</P>
<P>
   However, many Miami Valley teen-agers interviewed at the Dayton
Mall on Tuesday said the new rule is unnecessary, and would do
little to deter violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous that people think violence in movies causes
violence in teen-agers,'' said 17-year-old Susanna Letham of
Centerville. ``Life is not written in script.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dumb,'' said Jeff Nartker, 16, of West Carrollton. He
said teens ``will get in anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Letham said she thinks ratings are almost beside the point,
given the general scope of sex and violence in pop entertainment.
``If they cut it out (movies) would still still have the same
quality, and more people would come to see them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Parents, perhaps not surprisingly, had more mixed views.
</P>
<P>
   While John Stevens of Cincinnati said he believes Clinton has a
good idea, he was not optimistic about it decreasing teen-age
violence. ``I'm not a believer that (the entertainment industry)
causes violence. How parents bring their kids up determines how
they behave,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with this enforcement totally,'' Carlisle resident
Betty Landsaw said. ``If our kids would not see so much stuff, they
wouldn't do so much stuff. It's a little late in the game to be
effective, but it's a start.''
</P>
<P>
   A Dayton mother of two teen-age girls agreed. ``It's worth a
try. Kids see too many things they don't need to see, as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people wondered how effectively theaters would be able to
enforce the new rule. Several teen-agers said they didn't expect to
have much trouble getting in to see movies they want to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't work _ people at the places won't follow the rule
because they don't now,'' said Demetria Chambliss, 15, of Huber
Heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now more fake IDs will get made,'' said Adam Taylor, 25, of
Eaton.
</P>
<P>
   Barb Gells of Englewood was more optimistic. ``It is a good
idea, if the people at the movie theaters enforce it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most local theater managers declined comment. But Bill
Alexander, assistant manager of downtown Dayton's New Neon Movies,
said enforcement may be difficult, and will depend primarily on
who's working the box office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I don't think it will work. It's at the cashier's
discretion. If they look underage, we would card, just like for
alcohol and tobacco,'' he said. ``But there's no real way one could
enforce it unless ushers went through and checked every person.''

HASTERT PEP TALK CAN'T UNITE REPUBLICANS ON SPENDING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to insert Tuesday night's spending bill vote in 4th-from-last
graf. Also adds one extra sentence to that graf.)  (mk) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Speaker Dennis Hastert, pleading for unity, told
fellow Republicans Tuesday that they must stick together and pass
the party's major bills or risk losing their majority in the House.
</P>
<P>
   But despite a public display of mutual respect among the
Republicans after Hastert's pep talk, they are still deeply divided
over how to pass $538 billion in spending bills to finance the
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a long, hot summer,'' said the majority whip,
Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas. ``We all know that. It's going to be very
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 20-minute closed-door speech to the House Republican
conference, Hastert cracked no whips, twisted no arms and laid down
no laws. Paraphrasing Benjamin Franklin, the speaker said the
Republicans had to hang together or they would assuredly hang
separately.
</P>
<P>
   He asked them to ``give your leadership the benefit of the doubt
and just follow,'' according to members who were there. He urged
them to ``search your heart _ search your conscience,'' to put
aside the politics that have torn conservatives and moderates
asunder, ``and then decide to join us.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he warned that the stakes were high. ``Whether you
call it political, whether you call it the fiscal future of this
country or whether you call it the moral future of this country,
we're at the crossroads and that's what we're talking about in this
thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert reminded the Republicans of their precarious 223-211
majority, and warned that they could lose the House next year if
they did not govern the Legislature, govern themselves and pass the
spending bills _ the only thing Congress is legally required to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``This notion that we're a do-nothing Congress sinks in after a
while,'' said Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill. He said Hastert made ``a
compelling argument that if we want to stay the majority, we've got
to act like the governing party.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, all the spending bills have been stalled. The main
stumbling block has been conservative Republicans who want all
domestic spending frozen or cut, and all Social Security surpluses
saved.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert offered no financial details of his plans to win passage
for the year's major spending bills. Republican aides say he will
shift more than $5 billion from bills financing the Defense,
Treasury and Agriculture Departments, Congress and military
construction, and move the money into bills for the Labor,
Education, Health and Human Services Departments and other domestic
programs, which took deep cuts in the Republican budget plan.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to mollify moderate Republicans who say those cuts
are too deep, while assuring conservatives that the strict budget
caps approved by Congress and the White House in 1997 will remain
in place.
</P>
<P>
   But the strategy may be doomed. Many Republicans say there is
simply too little money to pass the bills under the caps. Shuffling
a few billion dollars, says the staff director of the House
Appropriations Committee, James Dyer, is like rearranging the deck
chairs on the Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   So Hastert and DeLay have a fallback plan, key aides said
Tuesday: Let the appropriations process fail.
</P>
<P>
   Then they would try to force Democrats to create a spending plan
that breaks the budget caps, soaks up Social Security surpluses and
gives the Republicans a campaign issue for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans will demagogue on Social Security and we're
prepared to fight that battle,'' a senior Republican aide warned
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Their argument against the Democrats would be: `` `You're the
party of school lunches, we're the party of Social Security,' '' he
said. ``We will tag them as big spenders. We'll be able to define
ourself on two potent political issues: Save Social Security,
balance the budget. If we don't, we'll be the ones who didn't
balance it, and who raided Social Security, in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats may not fall for this strategy. ``It's their budget,''
said the minority leader, Dick Gephardt, D-Mo. ``They're going to
have to pass it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans said they were baffled by the lack of details
in Hastert's new spending plan, which appears to be a work in
progress. The plan was not cleared in advance with Rep. C.W. Bill
Young of Florida, the chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee, which controls the 13 spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't understand how this new strategy works,'' said
Elizabeth Morra, a spokeswoman for the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Edward Porter, R-Ill., chairman of the appropriations
subcommittee for the Labor, Health and Human Services, and
Education departments, said an extra 2 or 3 billion dollars would
not help his bill that much. His appropriation was cut by nearly
$11 billion by House leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan, or its goals, won over a key conservative, Rep.
Tom Coburn, R-Okla. ``The proof,'' he said, ``will be in the
details and how we stay together.''
</P>
<P>
   And by winning over Coburn, Hastert unlocked the first major
spending bill to reach the House floor, a $60.8 billion measure for
agriculture programs. The bill passed Tuesday night on a near
party-line vote of 246-183. The Senate has yet to write its
version.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Coburn, a family physician, singlehandedly
stalled the agriculture bill in the name of the Social Security
surplus. It increased spending for the coming year, and that was
intolerable, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Young cut $102.5 million from the bill on the House
floor, and Coburn withdrew the legislative roadblocks he had
erected.
</P>
<P>
   But then the doctor, showing the power of conservatives to shape
the spending bills, won an amendment barring the Food and Drug
Administration from testing, developing or approving the use of the
abortion drug RU-486. The amendment passed by a 217-214 vote after
three Republicans, at the behest of DeLay, switched their votes
from nay to yea at the last minute.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: US AIR MAKES PASSENGERS BOARD EARLIER 
</HEADLINE>
   (duplication warning: also sent with `t' code)  
 (bl)  
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last-minute passengers on US Airways risk being left at the gate
as the carrier has begun to follow the industry standard of
requiring that they board planes at least 10 minutes before
scheduled departures. The reason, the airline said, is that
customers expect and deserve dependability, and on-time departures
are necessary for achieving that result.
</P>
<P>
   The airline industry's on-time performance, meaning flights that
arrive within 15 minutes of schedule, has dropped from a high of
82.5 percent in 1991 to 77.2 percent last year, a drop that would
probably not surprise many passengers. The major reasons for the
fall, airlines say, are record numbers of passengers in recent
years, fuller planes and time-consuming security procedures at
check-in.
</P>
<P>
   Because delays typically ripple throughout the system, angering
passengers on late-arriving planes as well as passengers waiting to
connect to them, airlines _ which have been profitable the past few
years, after losing billions earlier in the decade _ have not
hesitated to play hardball with laggard passengers. Michael Boyd,
president of the Boyd Group, an aviation consulting company, said
that when he was in Chicago's O'Hare International Airport
recently, a gate agent announced: ``Ladies and gentlemen, we have
four people who have not gotten on the airplane. If you're not on
in one minute, you lose your seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Airline News
</P>
<P>
   Other major airlines followed the lead of United Airlines on
Tuesday after United, the nation's biggest carrier, reduced
off-peak fares as much as 25 percent for travel from June 22
through Sept. 30, and capped advance round-trip fares for peak
travel days at $498. Among the restrictions are that tickets must
be bought no later than June 18. Examples include a New
York-to-Chicago round trip for $238 with up to two companions
traveling for $138 each, and New York to London for $398. The sale
followed United's warning Friday that its second-quarter earnings
would fall short of forecasts because of higher costs and lighter-
than-expected traffic in May.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways is offering $338 round-trip fares bought on the
Internet for travel between Los Angeles and six Eastern cities _
Baltimore, Boston, New York (La Guardia Airport), Newark,
Philadelphia and Washington (Ronald Reagan National Airport and
Dulles International Airport). Tickets must be purchased by June 13
for travel from June 24 through Sept. 30. In both cases,
restrictions apply.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are all United States domestic flights smoke-free, so
are 97 percent of all flights between the United States and foreign
destinations, according to Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater.
Two days ago Slater said that All Nippon Airways, Japan Airlines,
Transero Airlines, Turkish Airlines and Varig Airlines had recently
eliminated smoking on all their flights, while Air India eliminated
smoking on all flights serving the United States and Alitalia
prohibited smoking on 80 percent of its trans-Atlantic flights.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate the first nonstop flights between Miami and
Istanbul, Turkish Airlines is offering round-trip flights between
both cities for $599 through the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel Update
</P>
<P>
   The latest hotel planning to rent all or part of its rooms over
this New Year's Eve is the adobe-style Hotel Loretto in downtown
Santa Fe, N.M. For $49,000, the Loretto is offering its
presidential suite plus four oversize rooms for three nights,
suitable for a party of 10.
</P>
<P>
   Guests can save 15 percent off Howard Johnson's regular rates
this entire year by paying for their stay with an American Express
credit card. The lodging chain is owed by Cendant.
</P>
<P>
   Rooms at all La Quinta Inns are on sale for $49 a night through
Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   After Motel 6's long-running ``We'll leave the light on for
you'' advertising campaign was recently chosen as one of the 100
best ad campaigns of the last century by Advertising Age magazine _
making it the only hotel company to make the list _ the hotel
chain's new television ads are using actors for the first time. Tom
Bodett, who has been the Motel 6 spokesman since 1986, will be
off-camera when he interviews the ``guests'' about when they first
``saw the light'' and began staying at Motel 6, owned by Accor.
</P>
<P>
   A Matter of Duty
</P>
<P>
   After duty-free shopping is abolished by the European Union on
July 1, Amsterdam's Schipol Airport and the shopkeepers of the
airport's duty-free shopping center will pay the value-added tax on
all items except alcohol and tobacco bought by passengers traveling
within the European Union. &QL;

COMMENTARY: PUPPY LOVE POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs penultimate graf for grammatical fixes) (jt)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ I know exactly how the Republicans feel.
</P>
<P>
   They've ensorcelled themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They really, really want this relationship to work out. After
eight lonely years they've eagerly invented the image of their
desires, imbuing him with magical qualities. Their fantasy guy will
sweep in and transform their humdrum little lives. They're
banishing all doubts, ruling out all rivals, ignoring any
disturbing intrusions of reality.
</P>
<P>
   They are counting the moments until the Big Crush replaces the
Big Creep.
</P>
<P>
   You can picture Trent Lott and Dick Armey and Tom DeLay acting
like giggling schoolgirls, drawing hearts in their ``G.W.B.''
scrapbooks while they watch ``Dawson's Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   Yup, the Republicans are bewitched. And that means soon they'll
be bothered. And then bewildered.
</P>
<P>
   Dreamboats always sink.
</P>
<P>
   W. goes on his blind date with history this weekend, chaperoned
by a couple of hundred ravenous reporters, making his maiden
campaign swing to Iowa and New Hampshire. There is a stopover in
Kennebunkport, a town that, like his name, evokes the presidency.
Just in case anyone missed the connection, Junior will be stopping
by to celebrate Poppy's 75th on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans should remain besotted as long as their crush can
pass a few simple tests:
</P>
<P>
   1. He'll be more deft on a rope line than Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   2. He will keep everyone from realizing that ``compassionate
conservatism'' is a fallacy, that you can't be generous and mingy
at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   3. He will be so attractive to women that soccer moms won't even
listen to Al Gore babbling about how he'll fix traffic jams and
suburban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   4. His position on abortion will be so nuanced, so finely tuned,
so beautifully befuddling that the Christian Coalition will think
he's fervently anti-abortion and NOW will understand that he's
secretly pro-choice.
</P>
<P>
   5. When reporters ask why he wasn't in Vietnam, he'll have a
much better excuse than Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   6. The fact that W. has been studying foreign affairs so
diligently, and the fact that he now knows not to call the Kosovars
``Kosovians'' or the Greeks ``Grecians,'' will be seen as signs of
growth and maturity, not as the beginning of some horrible Quayle
gaffe trajectory.
</P>
<P>
   7. If a nude picture of W. dancing on a bar does show up, it
will be flattering and have good lighting.
</P>
<P>
   8. His platform will be so appealing that voters won't notice
that the Republicans can't pass a simple spending bill and don't
even have the pretense of an agenda.
</P>
<P>
   9. His position on gun control will be so nuanced, so finely
tuned, so beautifully befuddling that Rosie O'Donnell and Charlton
Heston will both rush to endorse it.
</P>
<P>
   10. Boomers will find him groovy, even though he once confessed
that in the '60s he did not like the Beatles when they went through
their ``weird psychedelic period.''
</P>
<P>
   11. His vision will be as compelling as Ronald Reagan's and his
manners as elegant as his father's.
</P>
<P>
   12. His position on Social Security will be so nuanced, so
finely tuned, so beautifully befuddling that it will be hailed by
the AARP, Wall Street and MTV.
</P>
<P>
   13. He will never lose that famous temper.
</P>
<P>
   14. Reporters will gush over him more than John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   15. His pledge-torturing, beer-guzzling frat-boy past will seem
endlessly amusing, like the raffish Otter in ``Animal House.''
</P>
<P>
   16. Even if he did do something illegal, his escapades will seem
classier than Bill Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   17. His position on campaign finance reform will be so nuanced,
so finely tuned, so beautifully befuddling that it will get
Republicans off the hook with Common Cause without stopping the
GOP's soft-money pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   18. People will buy that story about his being a self-made
businessman.
</P>
<P>
   19. His part-ownership of the Texas Rangers will make him seem
even more of a jock than Bill Bradley.

ANGELS HAPLESS AT PLATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's time for a change, Mo Vaughn says.
</P>
<P>
   What the Anaheim Angels hitters are doing these days isn't
working, so they need to make adjustments. Which sounds logical,
considering their only runs in a 6-2 loss to the San Francisco
Giants on Tuesday at 3Com Park were driven in by pitcher Steve
Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks' two-out double in the fifth inning was his first
major-league hit.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks also pitched well, giving up three runs and eight hits in
61/3 innings, but the club's lack of offense made his effort almost
meaningless and put the pressure on the defense to be perfect.
</P>
<P>
   With the game tied at 2-2, shortstop Andy Sheets couldn't come
up with a hard grounder by Armando Rios with two out in the seventh
inning. Though it was ruled a single, it was a play Sheets said he
should have made and led to three Giants runs and a 5-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   With the way they're hitting, a three-run deficit late in the
game is curtains for the Angels, who didn't have a hit after Todd
Greene's one-out single in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The last-place Angels are 27-31 despite having the No. 2
pitching staff and No. 1 defense in the American League. The
offense, though, ranks 12th in batting average and runs scored. On
the current road trip (three games in L.A. and two in San
Francisco), the Angels are hitting .235.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like this,'' said Vaughn, who went 2 for 2 with a walk
before leaving the game in the sixth inning when his ankle
stiffened up. ``I'm not used to this. One of the things that this
team needs is it's got to find itself and iron things out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to shake things up with our mental approach in terms
of what we're trying to do, because that's what this game is all
about. It's mental. . . . It's not always about talent. It's how
you are mentally. If I'm making outs, I'm going to do something
different. I'm going to break my bat to stay inside the ball and
hit the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   What made the Angels' performance so bad Tuesday was it made
Giants pitcher Shawn Estes (3-4) look so good. Estes had been in
danger of losing his spot in the starting rotation until facing the
Angels. But he allowed only the two runs and five hits in seven
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Angels right fielder Tim Salmon has four or five weeks of rehab
on his sprained left wrist, but he had as many hits Tuesday as
Angels starters Randy Velarde, Reggie Williams, Garret Anderson,
Troy Glaus and Tim Unroe combined _ zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's having fun,'' Salmon said. ``I can guarantee that.
Everyone's trying hard, maybe too hard to get that hit. And that's
disabling in itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Terry Collins promised more changes in the lineup
for today's game, but unless the club is planning to trade for Ken
Griffey Jr., the lineup figures to have the same punchless players.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to work with what he's got,'' Vaughn said of Collins.
``What are you going to do? There's nothing he can do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the first inning off
Sparks, the inning keyed by Bill Mueller's double and a solo homer
by Jeff Kent.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks tied the game with his two-run double in the fifth, but
the Angels fell behind in the seventh after Sparks was lifted with
one on and one out. Consecutive two-out singles by Rios and Stan
Javier (off Scott Schoeneweis) and Rich Aurilia (off Mark
Petkovsek) turned a 2-2 game into 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, every team I've been on, the offense gets in a
little funk sometimes,'' Sparks said. ``The pitching has the job to
pick up the slack, because there are going to be times later in the
season when they pick us up. As soon as we get on the same page,
we'll get on a roll.''

COLLEGES INCREASING ASIAN-AMERICAN STUDIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The historian Evelyn Hu-DeHart sees a paradox for Asian-American
college students: They are flocking to campuses in greater numbers,
but see little of themselves in the curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're visible and invisible at the same time,'' said Ms.
Hu-DeHart, who heads the ethnic studies department at the
University of Colorado and studies Asians in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But that is beginning to change. Largely in response to
students' demands, colleges are establishing programs in
Asian-American studies and hiring a record number of scholars
specializing in those subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are at least 43 undergraduate programs _ twice as
many as a decade ago _ at campuses from Columbia in New York to the
University of Texas to the University of Pennsylvania, according to
the Association for Asian-American Studies, a national academic
group. Most of the new programs allow undergraduates to earn minors
in the area; a few allow majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never been hotter,'' said John Kuo Wei Tchen, a historian
who studies Chinese-Americans and one who was hired in 1996 to
begin the Asian-Pacific-American Studies program at New York
University. ``On the one hand, it's driven by demographics. On the
other hand, there are intellectual arguments'' for offering these
programs.
</P>
<P>
   And with the increased demand for scholars to teach the new
courses, some institutions are hiring adjunct professors without
advanced degrees, or academics who once specialized in Asian
subjects like post-colonial Indian literature, rather than in
Asian-American studies.
</P>
<P>
   The field itself has undergone rapid changes. Once primarily
focused on the history and literature of Americans of Chinese and
Japanese ancestry on the West Coast, courses are now as likely to
explore the history of Indians in Britain as they are to study the
internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Colorado, where Ms. Hu-DeHart teaches, offers
an undergraduate major in ethnic studies, which includes courses in
Asian-American studies. The University of Texas approved the
creation of an Asian-American studies program several years ago,
but recently became embroiled in a battle with its students, over
whether the students could have a voice in the selection of a
program director; in May, student protests resulted in 10 arrests.
</P>
<P>
   At Columbia University, where Asian-American and Hispanic
students staged protests in 1994, programs in both areas were
established last year in the interdisciplinary Center for the Study
of Ethnicity and Race. An alumni group has raised about $1 million
to support Asian-American studies.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for such courses is hardly surprising. Since the late
1980s, Asian-American students have been arriving on campus in
record numbers. (Many are the children of immigrants who came to
the United States after the passage of the Immigration Act of
1965.)
</P>
<P>
   At New York University, for example, 21 percent of
undergraduates this year identified themselves as Asian-American,
up from 10 percent in 1980. At Columbia, the number is close to 17
percent, and at the University of Pennsylvania, 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The boom in Asian-American studies is relatively recent, but its
origins go back three decades _ to California in the late 1960s,
when Asian-American students, following their black peers,
successfully pressed for classes exploring their own history and
literature.
</P>
<P>
   In the next decades, Asian-American curriculums, like other
ethnic studies programs, have repeatedly come under fire from
conservatives, who say such efforts fragment what should be a
standard curriculum of American history and culture. In recent
years, a handful of colleges, like Princeton, have begun to
incorporate Asian-American studies under the banner of American
studies.
</P>
<P>
   And scholars in the field, like Gary Okihiro, the director of
Columbia's Asian-American studies program, say they must contend
with an intellectual dilemma. As a historian, Okihiro says he
studies Asian-Americans as members of a racial minority because
that is how they are seen by the white majority. But he also
struggles against the notion of studying history only through the
lens of racial categories. ``While they empower,'' he says, ``they
may also disempower by precluding solidarities across those
racialized borders.''
</P>
<P>
   Three decades ago, there was a thick wall between those who
studied Asia and those who studied Asian-Americans. In fact, many
Asian-Americans vigorously resisted merging the two disciplines,
saying it would only reinforce the stereotype of Asian-Americans as
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with technological advances connecting Asian-Americans both
to Asia and the many countries where Asians have settled, its
scholars no longer seem overly concerned with study of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking very seriously at the forces that provoke
immigration, how they work in both directions, how people go back
and forth,'' said David Palumbo-Liu, a professor of comparative
literature at Stanford and the author of a book that explores how
relations with Asia have shaped modern American history.
</P>
<P>
   But the broader focus can also be risky, some scholars say.
Focusing on ``the Chinese diaspora,'' for example, can blur the
distinctions between people of Chinese extraction living in
different countries, contends Arif Dirlik, a historian who studies
China at Duke University. This ``whimpering preoccupation with the
location of home,'' can ultimately create fertile grounds for
racism, Dirlik writes in the forthcoming book, ``Across the
Pacific: Asian-Americans and Globalization'' (Temple University
Press), which was edited by Ms. Hu-DeHart.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he writes, ``what is important is to enable people to
feel at home where they live.''

MAZMANIAN TO RETIRE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM McCONNELL  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALNUT, Calif. __ Art Mazmanian, baseball coach at Mt. San
Antonio College for the past 31 seasons, has announced his
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been fun, but Shirley (Mazmanian's wife) needs me now,''
Mazmanian said in announcing his decision to step down.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Mazmanian had back surgery several years ago, which left
her with limited mobility.
</P>
<P>
   The Mazmanians reside in Walnut. Their daughter, Nancy, is a
public relations director for the California Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've recommended Tom Pokorski to take over the program,''
Mazmanian said. ``He's done a great job as my assistant the past
few seasons and he's certainly deserving. And, if he wants me too,
I'd be glad to help him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazmanian, 72, succeeded Ron Squire as coach of the Mounties in
1969. Prior to that, he had coached baseball and football at Dorsey
High in Los Angeles, the school he graduated from in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   Mazmanian was an All-American second baseball at USC, played on
the Trojans' 1948 national championship squad, graduated from USC
in 1949 and then spent six seasons in the New York Yankees farm
system.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to coaching at Mt. SAC and Dorsey, Mazmanian spent
17 summers managing in the minor leagues. In all, he coached
baseball for 44 years and his teams won 1,500 games.
</P>
<P>
   He served as an assistant coach under Rod Dedeaux for the U.S.
Olympic team in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   At Mt. SAC, Mazmanian's teams won 709 games and suffered through
only two losing seasons in 31 years. More than 120 of his players
went on to play pro ball, including former or current major
leaguers Doug Bird, Mike Potter, Kevin Bell, Ron Roenicke, Bob
Veselic, Rob Nelson, Terry Clark, Keith Lockhart, Brett Tomko and
Chris Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maz was the best manager I played for in baseball,'' said
former major leaguer Jack Clark, who played for Mazmanian at Great
Falls (Montana) in the Pioneer League in 1973. ``In terms of
knowledge of the game and handling players, he was head and
shoulders above most of the guys I played for in the pros, and that
includes some of my major league managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He helped me tremendously, not because it would help him keep
his job but because it would help me become a better player. He's a
very classy, unselfish man, the type of guy you don't find very
often.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mounties went 27-17 in Mazmanian's final season and made the
State Community College playoffs. Midway through the season, the
team was forced to forfeit six games due to use of an ineligible
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all my years here, I never had that happen before,''
Mazmanian said. ``It (the forfeits) was a tough thing to deal with.
It's bad when something the coaching staff and athletic department
does, or in this case, doesn't do has a negative impact on the
kids. The forfeits cost us a shot at a conference title, and my
players knew it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I really admired our guys for battling back and winning a
doubleheader over L.A. Harbor on the last day of the regular season
to get us into the playoffs. That was something to be proud of.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first team at Mt. SAC won a conference title (in 1969), so
it would have been nice to go out with another title. But it just
wasn't to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, the really important thing, beyond the wins and losses,
is that I had the honor and privilege of coaching so many great
kids. You don't become a coach because you want to win, you become
a coach because you want to help kids become better players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a great run at Mt. SAC, and now the time is right to end
it. Family comes first.''

ALBANY BUDGET RIFT WIDENS AS LEGISLATORS TRADE INSULTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ On a day when New York state's budget became the
third latest in history, the Capitol's power players reinforced
Tuesday how far they are from an accord, digging in their
positions, heading off in divergent directions and insulting one
another.
</P>
<P>
   With legislators despairing of a deal any time soon, the
Republican-controlled Senate passed its own, detailed version of
the budget Tuesday, a largely symbolic step usually taken in March,
not June.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat-controlled Assembly has not gone even that far.
Tuesday, the Assembly began passing the pieces of the budget that
are relatively free of controversy, excluding disputed areas like
health care and education that account for more than half the
state's spending.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver reiterated his claim that Senate
Majority Leader Joseph Bruno was trying to lure the Assembly into
passing the Senate's budget, only to have Gov. George Pataki, a
Republican, veto the Democrats' projects. ``All of this is just an
exercise in futility,'' Silver said. ``It's just a sham. It is the
Republican Party putting Senator Bruno and other Republicans in
line in order to stake out a political position.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruno retorted: ``The speaker has a way of sort of getting
exasperated and frustrated and calling names. Shelly's got to go
back to kindergarten.'' As for the Assembly's passage of parts of a
budget, he said, ``He's playing a shell game with the budget, a
Shelly game, where you pass the easy parts and don't deal with the
hard parts.''
</P>
<P>
   The sticking point remains Silver's insistence that the governor
get involved in budget talks and promise not to engage in the kind
of wide-ranging line-item vetoes he made last year, when he
eliminated 1,300 items worth more than $1 billion, mostly inserted
by the Democrats, from the Legislature's budget.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has refused to be drawn into the process, a position
unlike that of previous governors. But Tuesday, he appeared to give
a little. ``I'm willing to talk, and if the speaker needs certain
assurances on certain things, I'm willing to do that,'' he said.
But he refused to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, both houses are set to finish their business for the
year, and it would be all but impossible for them to agree on a
budget by then. It is unclear how they will proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Since the April 1 start of the fiscal year, the state has kept
running with a series of two-week emergency bills. Silver said his
budget, if adopted by the Senate, too, would eliminate the need to
return repeatedly over the summer to pass emergency bills.
Republicans, including the governor, have talked of a longer-term
emergency bill, perhaps of two to three months, an overt admission
that attempts to form a budget have utterly failed.
</P>
<P>
   The latest state budget was in 1997, 126 days overdue, when the
Assembly Democrats refused to negotiate until the state's rent
regulation laws had been renewed. The second tardiest was in 1996,
at 104 days late, when Pataki refused to enact a budget until the
Legislature agreed to changes in the state's workers' compensation
law to save employers money. On Wednesday, this year's budget will
be 70 days overdue, one day past the 1994 mark for futility.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has proposed a $72.7 billion budget. The Senate's plan
adds $1.1 billion in spending, though it says the net increase is
smaller, because the governor overestimated some expenses, and $1.2
billion a year in tax cuts. The Assembly's plan adds an estimated
$2 billion to $4 billion in spending over the governor's.

EDITORIAL: RICHARD SHELBY IS NO ROBIN HOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, June 9:
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the Memorial Day recess, Sen. Richard Shelby
started to pick the pockets of both California and New York state.
The Senate Appropriations Committee voted overwhelmingly to impose
the Alabama Republican senator's 12.5 percent ceiling on what any
one state can receive of the annual total of federal rapid-transit
aid. That would siphon off some $200 million to $300 million that
would ordinarily go to New York or California in fiscal 2000 and
redistribute it in equal shares to the other 48 states for mass
transit.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby seems eager to reopen a fight Congress settled last year.
After considerable haggling among rural states, populous ones and
regional blocs, Congress reached consensus on the formulas for
apportioning more than $200 billion in highway and transit aid over
the next several years. The formula for highway aid, which is where
most of the federal gas tax revenue goes, tilts toward awarding
many states as much in aid as they contribute in gas taxes. That
helps auto-dependent states.
</P>
<P>
   Standard aid formulas for mass transit, by contrast, rely on
ridership, passenger miles and rail service, much of which happens
to be concentrated in New York and California. New York State
carries a third of the nation's rail and bus riders. California
transports nearly 15 percent. Without these subways, commuter rail
lines, light rail systems and buses, major metropolitan areas in
both states would choke on highway congestion.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby's Transit Equity Provision pretends to champion fairness
even as it steals money from overburdened transit systems and
distributes it to states that may not have matching funds or
projects ready to carry out. But ``fairness'' cuts many ways.
</P>
<P>
   In fiscal 1997, by one analysis, New York delivered $14.2
billion more in taxes to Washington than it received in aid, and
California delivered $11.8 billion more. Shelby's Alabama, on the
other hand, was the beneficiary of $6.9 billion more in aid than it
gave Washington in taxes. Is it ``fair'' to make these imbalances
even greater?

 &HT;    Braves outslug Rays 11-2
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Forget about the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and any cliches
that might apply to their five-game losing streak. The Braves are
finding new ways to win.
</P>
<P>
   And new people to do it.
</P>
<P>
   With Ryan Klesko at home with flu symptoms the past two days,
Gerald Williams has used Tampa Bay pitchers for his own personal
rampage. Ozzie Guillen got in on the act Tuesday as well. They had
four hits apiece to fuel Atlanta's offense in an 11-2 win.
</P>
<P>
   In two games, Williams is 6-for-8 with five RBIs and three runs,
Monday in the eighth spot and Tuesday at leadoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a leadoff hitter, what I was trying to do was have patience
and be more relaxed at the plate and it worked for me,'' said
Williams, who was 0-for-23 before Monday's game. ``(Guillen and I)
have been struggling a lot. Tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Guillen was 4 for 4, equalling the number of hits he had in his
first eight games replacing Walt Weiss in the starting lineup. He
raised his average from .141 to .183 in the process and scored
three runs in a game that ended with the announcement that Weiss
had been put on the 15-day disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I got four hits I think I was in Double-A,''
said Guillen, who actually now has 17 four-hit games in his big
league career. ``I got a couple lucky ones and that got me more
comfortable at the plate. I got way better at-bats today and that's
all I wanted today.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Odalis Perez, who won the game to move to 4-2, chipped
in with a sacrifice, scored a run and drove in two runs on a bloop
single to left, his second major league hit and second hit in his
last two starts.
</P>
<P>
   Bret Boone drove in his first run in 14 games to start it all
off in one of the best at-bats of the game, working a 2-2 Wilson
Alvarez pitch into center field for a 1-0 lead in the first inning,
one Atlanta would never lose.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Devil Rays, life is pretty bleak at the moment, no
matter how they slice it:
</P>
<P>
   1) They are now 0-5 in interleague play this season, 0-5 against
Atlanta all-time, and a season-worst 10 games under .500 at 24-34.
</P>
<P>
   2) The team which leads the major leagues with players sent to
the disabled list, added another one on Tuesday with Monday night's
starter Dave Eiland (back soreness). During Tuesday's game reliever
Mike Duvall left with a sore muscle in his side and Jose Canseco
left with stiffness in his back.

   3) They added two more errors - five now for the series - to
their AL worst total of 52 errors. Herbert Perry's throwing error
in the second inning fueled a four-run inning by Atlanta, which set
the tone for the night.

26 ARRESTED IN DRUG SMUGGLING NETWORK USING MOHAWK RESERVATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

   ST. REGIS MOHAWK RESERVATION _ Police managed to cripple but not
quite destroy the largest cocaine smuggling and selling operation
in northern New York state Tuesday in a series of rapid
early-morning raids, state and federal officials said. The raids
netted a few prize suspects, including a 24-year-old Mohawk Indian
man who, the officials said, ran the drug network from his home
here.
</P>
<P>
   By the time they were finished, shortly before 8 a.m., about 180
police officers from 13 state, U.S. Canadian, and local agencies,
including the St. Regis Mohawk Tribal Police Department, had
captured 26 suspects and charged them with possession and
conspiracy to sell cocaine and marijuana, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But officials said 13 additional drug suspects, including a man
in a Massachusetts nursing home, were still at large late Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials described Tuesday's raids as the culmination of
a yearlong investigation into the network that controlled hundreds
of pounds of South American cocaine, worth millions of dollars,
that they said flowed over the border each week in both directions.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the most common route for this and other
contraband, including liquor, cigarettes and approximately 300
illegal immigrants, most of them Chinese, runs through the
14,000-acre St. Regis Mohawk Reservation, which reaches from the
northern edge of New York over the St. Lawrence River and into
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a significant step in dealing with the drug
trafficking problem'' in northern New York, Thomas Maroney, U.S.
attorney for the Northern District of New York, said in a telephone
interview from Albany on Tuesday afternoon. Maj. William Warburton,
commander of a State Police Troop in Ray Brook, 60 miles southeast
of the reservation, called Tuesday's action ``certainly the largest
drug investigation and arrests that we've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   The raids were coordinated by the New York State Police, and
most of them were at the private homes of suspects, many of whom
live on or near the reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials, who gathered in Ray Brook to announce the
arrests, were pleased that the raids were swift and without injury
but they stressed that the roots of the cocaine trade ran deep.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Schrader, the district attorney for Franklin County,
which abuts the reservation, expressed caution. ``I don't pretend
that we've wiped out drug activity in Franklin County,'' he said.
``We've made a major dent'' he said, but ``we definitely did not
get everybody out.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hebert, a special agent with the Albany office of the
federal Drug Enforcement Administration, added, ``It's just a
matter of time before someone else picks up the ball again and runs
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrests started shortly after midnight, when undercover
agents' tried to buy cocaine from Jason Anderson, the man suspected
of running the drug network, State Police Capt. Peter Person said.
When the purchase broke down, Anderson went home in an extremely
agitated state, Person said, arousing fears that he might flee and
causing officers to decide arrest him as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the raids started as planned, at about 5 p.m., with
the arrest of another reservation resident, Peter Clute, 28, who
officials say helped Anderson bring cocaine into the United States,
mostly from South America and through Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the 26 people arrested, the police also confiscated
19 shotguns and handguns, Anderson's 1999 Cadillac and pickup
truck, $862 and a small amount of cocaine and marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Recent raids have seized far more cash and drugs. Canadian
authorities seized nearly 10 pounds of cocaine a month ago, and
last week the United States Border Patrol discovered about $330,000
in suspected drug money in a car driving down from Canada on
Interstate 87. Although the amounts of cash and drugs seized
Tuesday were negligible, the police were clearly happy to have put
Anderson behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   The Mohawk tribe has an agreement with federal and state
officials that prohibits police from patrolling the miles of river
shoreline and dozens of islands and inlets inside Indian territory.
</P>
<P>
   That is the major reason why the reservation ``is one of the
most controversial pieces of real estate'' in northern New York as
U.S. Customs Agent Mike Bridgeman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Maroney noted that the reservation has been under scrutiny for
many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of attention to alcohol and tobacco smuggling
_ literally all the time there are aliens being smuggled through
Akwesasne,'' said Maroney, using the Mohawk name for the souther
half of the reservation, the part in the United States. ``Drug
trafficking is obviously one more of these areas of concern.''
</P>
<P>
   The police lured Anderson and other suspects from Montreal to
the portion of the reservation that is in United States territory.
</P>
<P>
   On the reservation, few people even knew that heavily armed
officers in as many as 40 patrol cars and four-wheel-drive trucks
had even been there, blocking off roads and hauling away suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful, let them do it,'' John Bigtree, whose trailer home
sits on a patch of grass beside St. Regis Road, said shortly after
7 a.m. when he heard about the raids. He said it was clear to him
that the reservation has become increasingly troubled with ``a lot
of marijuana, a lot of cocaine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to clean them out,'' Bigtree said, waving a large,
weathered hand across his chest. ``They're ruining our little
kids.'' Drugs, he added, ``are really dividing this reservation.''

EDITORIAL: HALF-MEASURES FOR POOR NATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, June 9:
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund began
a program that was supposed to help the world's poorest nations
escape their debt traps. Dozens of nations spend up to 60 percent
of their budgets for interest on foreign debt that will never be
retired _ leaving little for the basic health care and education
needed to reduce poverty.
</P>
<P>
   But the debt reduction program has been too stingy. This month
the world's richest countries will decide how much to increase it.
The proposals offered fall far short of real relief.
</P>
<P>
   Debtor countries, mostly African, largely owe money that lenders
pushed on eager governments decades ago, in part to cover
commercial loans. The current relief program has several problems
that the wealthy nations, known as the G-7, say they want to fix at
their summit meeting in Cologne, Germany, on June 18. One is that
the standards for qualifying _ six years of adherence to an IMF
reform and austerity plan _ are so strict that only Uganda and
Bolivia have seen any reduction in their payments, and that has
been negligible. Another is that the IMF's austerity requirements
have forced countries to cut basic social services.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's limited plan, which will probably win support from
the other G-7 countries, would allow countries to qualify for debt
relief more quickly, focus the IMF on the importance of spending on
the poor, and allow several new countries to qualify. The
administration says a wider plan is unlikely to win over Congress
or other nations _ Japan and France are the biggest creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Congress may be more supportive than the administration thinks.
About 50 House members from across the spectrum back a plan
sponsored by Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, to provide deeper relief and
help insure that the money is better used. A Harvard economist,
Jeffrey Sachs, argues that the World Bank and IMF have the reserves
to forgive all they are owed by poor nations.
</P>
<P>
   Debt forgiveness must go to those who earn it through sound
economic policies and well-targeted social programs, but the
administration's proposal would allow only a handful of countries
to spend more on basic health and education needs. It is heartless
to argue that the United States or the IMF cannot afford to lift a
burden now borne by the children of Mali or Zambia.

YANKEES BLOW 5-RUN LEAD, LOSE TO PHILLIES, 11-5 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ If the Yankees had won Tuesday night, they would
have looked at this game as a turning point in their season.
Remember that game when Hideki Irabu outpitched Curt Schilling,
they would say. Remember how we shuffled the lineup and everybody
relaxed and hit better, they would say.
</P>
<P>
   But now they will try to forget Tuesday night's game, in which
the Yankees blew a five-run lead and suffered a horrible, wrenching
defeat, 11-5, their third consecutive loss.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, could be seen muttering in
frustration in the dugout during the disastrous seventh inning,
when the Phillies scored nine runs, and who could blame him. There
was so much to gain on this night: Irabu had pitched well (two runs
in five and one-third innings), the Yankees had beaten on Schilling
for five runs in six innings with their former patient approach,
and for the third straight day, they could have edged past Boston
and into first place in the American League East.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the evening ended with the Yankees' middle relief in
complete shambles and with New York once again on the verge of
being swept at Veterans Stadium. The Phillies took three straight
from the Yankees here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In a lineup that Torre shuffled, Derek Jeter and Tino Martinez
slugged two-run home runs and the Yankees led, 5-0, going into the
bottom of the sixth inning. Irabu typically wilts in the sort of
scorching heat that hovered over this city Tuesday evening, and
when he allowed a pair of doubles in the sixth inning, Torre
relieved him with Ramiro Mendoza, probably figuring that it was
best to remove Irabu with his confidence soaring.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza allowed another hit and a walk in the sixth, but still,
the Yankees held a 5-2 lead going into the seventh, and with the
closer Mariano Rivera ready for the ninth inning, they seemed to
have the game under control.
</P>
<P>
   But they were shattered in the seventh, which began with Jeter
fumbling a ground ball. Mendoza allowed a hit and then walked the
pinch-hitter Rob Ducey, who had been 0 for 12 coming off the bench.
Torre replaced Mendoza with Jason Grimsley, a right-hander coming
off a brutal outing Monday, when he walked five in one and
one-third innings and fired his final pitch to the backstop.
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley walked Doug Glanville to force home a run, and then
Marlon Anderson bounced a two-run single to center field, tying the
game. After Scott Rolen's sacrifice fly allowed Glanville to jog
home with the go-ahead run, Grimsley nearly threw another pitch to
the backstop. Grimsley was out and Dan Naulty was in.
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley's recent disintegration is devastating to the Yankees.
The journeyman pitcher, who has a history of wildness, had been
dominant, and when Jeff Nelson suffered an elbow injury last week,
Torre spoke confidently of moving Grimsley into that role. In the
wake of two horrendous outings, Yankee officials must evaluate
whether Grimsley's failure was an aberration _ or whether his
success was.
</P>
<P>
   Naulty, who had pitched three innings over the previous two
games, allowed two singles, a walk and then hit a batter to force
home another run. The nine runs were the most allowed in an inning
by the Yankees since May 31, 1998, when they surrendered 11 to
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are 32-24. Last year, they did not have their 24th
defeat until July 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just haven't had that extended period of time where we've
played really well,'' Paul O'Neill said before the game. ``Whether
we're flat, or whatever, I think it's official: We're not going to
do what we did last year, so let's get rid of that and go on from
there.
