<HEADLINE> Ancient Disease Presents New Challenge to Human Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- An infectious disease that has
plagued mankind for several millenia is likely to launch a new
global offensive against the human race.
</P>
<P>
An official with the World Health Organization announced here
today that the disease, tuberculosis (TB), which became curable
since effective drugs were developed in the 1940s, again became
the top killer among infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
"Closely linked with the emergence of multi-drug resistant
strains of TB and the HIV/AIDS epidemic, TB has re-emerged as a
major public health problem in both developed and developing
countries," A.H. Schnur, acting representative of WHO's Beijing
Office, said at a seminar marking the 115th anniversary of Dr
Robert Koch's discovery of the bacillus which causes TB.
</P>
<P>
Among 1.7 billion people who have been infected by TB, 20
million have developed into TB patients, and about 3.5 million of
them die every year, according to WHO's statistics.
</P>
<P>
The organization also predicted that in the coming decade
another 90 million people will become TB patients and more than 30
million will die.
</P>
<P>
Dr Koch's discovery may have marked a vital success in humans'
perpetual battle against TB. But now they are being challenged by
a new question -- Will people win another round in this battle?
</P>
<P>
"His (Koch's) discovery opened the way to diagnosing, curing
and possibly even eliminating TB. But progress since 1882 has been
painfully slow," A.H.Schnur said.
</P>
<P>
"While drugs are now available to cure TB, they are not
affordable or not accessible to those most in need," he
explained. "Even when treatment is available, patients often start
treatment and stop ... before the disease is fully cured."
</P>
<P>
Incorrect TB treatment would develop multidrug-resistant TB,
which means even more expensive and difficult treatment, and will
accelerate the speed at which TB infection spreads, said Prof. Tu
Dehua, director of the Beijing Institute for Tuberculosis Control.
</P>
<P>
Many other factors are also causing the global epidemic of TB,
such as dual TB/HIV epidemics, more chances of infection produced
by frequent transnational travelling, and people's ignorance, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Facing the new challenge, the last and the best chance for the
people may be DOTS, or directly observed treatment, short course,
which was introduced by WHO as the only way to reduce the
transmission of TB and lower the number of deaths due to the
disease.
</P>
<P>
"Under the strategy, patients receive their drug dosage daily
under the supervision of health staff to ensure that they take the
medicine for the full six month period usually required to cure
TB," A.H.Schnur said.
</P>
<P>
Cure rates in programs using DOTS have been shown to be much
higher than for programs not using DOTS, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has kicked off the world's biggest DOTS-using TB control
project since 1992, covering a population of 560 million in 12
provinces and autonomous regions, according to China's Ministry of
Health.
</P>
<P>
The project has helped cure 92 percent of pulmonary TB
patients, seven percentage points higher than the year 2000 goal
set by WHO.
</P>
<P>
"China's high cure rates and successful use of the DOTS
strategy has been an example for the rest of the world,"
A.H.Schnur said.

<HEADLINE> Access to Refugees in Zaire a Problem: UNHCR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The biggest problem facing
the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in
the war-torn Zaire is to get access to people displaced by war
there, a senior U.N. official said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Cape Town, UNHCR Chief Sadako Ogato
said: "We are talking to the allies to let us do our work,
especially at the Lubumbo Refugee Camp."
</P>
<P>
Efforts to get access to the people caught up in the war would
be intensified as these people need help immediately, said Ogato.
</P>
<P>
Ogato arrived in South Africa for a four-day visit to update
leaders on the refugee crisis in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after her arrival earlier in the day, Ogato held talks
with President Nelson Mandela at his Cape Town official
residence.

<P>
Ogato is also scheduled to address the parliament on Tuesday
about the refugee crisis and its solutions.

<HEADLINE> British Defense Secretary Meets With Chinese Army Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary Michael
Portillo said today his country is in full readiness to promote
bilateral relations and strengthen cooperation with China,
particularly in the military field.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Fu Quanyou, a member of China's Central
Military Commission and chief of the General Staff of the Chinese
People's Liberation Army, Portillo said that since both Britain
and China are permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and
play an important role in the world, there should be more reason
that the two countries increase contacts and exchanges.
</P>
<P>
"We not only respect China's past, but also have full
confidence on its future and believe that China will play a very
important role in the world arena," the British defense secretary
said.
</P>
<P>
General Fu, who arrived here Saturday on a five-day official
visit, said China is ready to strhe return of Hong Kong to China, a key issue in

the Sino-British relationship and a great event in the world, Fu
said that as there are only 99 days left before the handover on
June 30, both sides should handle the remaining issues properly
with the spirit of friendliness and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"This is also a test to the bilateral relations between China
and Britain," the Chinese general added.
</P>
<P>
He said that after the transfer of government in Hong Kong, the
Chinese government will hold on to the "one country, two systems"
concept laid out by the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, and
will guarantee the prosperity and development of the Hong Kong
society with the policies of "Hong Kong people governing Hong
Kong" and a high degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Fu also believed that after Hong Kong returns to China, both
countries will keep a good and healthy relationship between them.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in London, Fu will also hold talks with British
Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine and Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs Jeremy Hanley and visit British military bases.

<HEADLINE> New Education Curriculum Unveiled in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A new curriculum aimed at
breaking with the past and meeting the challenges of the 21st
century in South Africa was launched by Education Minister
Sibusiso Bengu in Cape Town today.
</P>
<P>
At a launching ceremony in Parliament, Bengu said Curriculum
2005, which has taken two years to develop, would introduce a
life-long people-centered education system for all throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
"The introduction of this new curriculum will play a major
role in helping to transform our country into one in which we all
want to live by producing thinking, caring learners," said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
Bengu said he was confident that the new curriculum would be a
giant step forward in ensuring quality education for all the
people in South Africa, and it would also be embraced by all
those who have a part in the learning process.
</P>
<P>
However, the new curriculum was immediately criticized by the
opposition National Party (NP) who claimed the initiative lacked
transparency and inclusivity.
</P>
<P>
NP education spokesman Renier Schoeman said "It is highly
regrettable that the Department of Education has chosen to deal
with this major step in what appears to be a non-transparent,
non-inclusive way."

<HEADLINE> Violence Continued in West Bank, Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli soldiers opened fire
and wounded a Palestinian today as violent confrontations
continued in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip between Israeli
soldiers and Palestinians protesters.
</P>
<P>
In Gaza Strip today, Israeli soldiers seriously wounded a
Palestinian riding on a donkey in Tel Sultan this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted security sources as saying that the man
did not have any identity papers with him when asked to
present them, and he then ignored orders to stop and kept
riding off when the Israeli soldiers opened fire on him.
</P>
<P>
This afternoon, a large number of Palestinian youths begun
to throw stones at Israeli troops stationed at Rachel's Tomb,
in Palestinian controlled Bethlehem in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The violent confrontations began during the early afternoon
hours, and as the number of Palestinian participants increased,
Israeli army evacuated the Jewish worshipers from Rachel's Tomb.
</P>
<P>
Later, the Israeli army declared the area a closed military
zone, barring Israelis and tourists from entering Bethlehem from
the southern Jerusalem neighborhood of Gilo.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two firebombs and stones were thrown at an
Israeli army patrol in Rafiah in the Gaza Strip early this
afternoon, but no one was injured.
</P>
<P>
Following a weekend of violence, once again a large number
of Palestinian demonstrators confronted with Israeli soldiers in
front of the Bet Hadassah building in the Jewish area of
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
On various occasions, Palestinian police tried to help calm
the angry Palestinian protesters, who have been demonstrating in
the past four days, during which more than 100 people were
injured.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have been increasing between Israel and the
Palestinians, following Friday's suicide bombing attack in Tel
Aviv, and continuous confrontations between Israeli soldiers and
Palestinians protesters.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Moussa Ranimat, 28, of Kafr Tsurif near Hebron,
detonated a three-kilogram TNT bomb packed with nails and
pieces of metal in a coffee shop in the center of Tel
Aviv, killing three women and wounding 48 others.
</P>
<P>
A closure was imposed on the West Bank and Gaza Strip
by the Israeli army immediately following the attack, barring
Palestinians from entering Israel.
</P>
<P>
The latest unrest came after Israeli government decided to
go ahead with the construction of a new Jewish neighborhood
in Jerusalem, despite strong condemnation warnings from the
Palestine National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
Palestinians term the construction, which started Tuesday
afternoon, as another Israeli attempt to Judaize Jerusalem, a city
which the Palestinians see as the capital for their future
independent state.
</P>
<P>
PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat said that Israel's insistence to
build on Jabal Abu Ghneim (Har Homa) "violates the signed
accords, and contradicts the Middle East peace process."
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu rejected
allegations that his government's decision to build Har Homa
created the conditions for the Friday suicide bombing attack.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu fingered the PNA as being responsible for
the attack, and demanded the PNA to rearrest 150 leaders of
Hamas and Islamic Jihad who have recently been released.
</P>
<P>
PNA officials condemned the suicide bombing attack, but
rejected charges that Arafat had given Hamas a "green light,"
by releasing some of the organization's activists. the PNA today
also rejected an Israeli demand to crack down Islamic militants in
the PNA controlled areas.

<HEADLINE> First Gulf War Reparations Already in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Egypt said today the first portion
of 1991 Gulf War reparations, amounting to 58.3 million
U.S. dollars, has already reached the Central Bank of Egypt from
the United Nations Reparations Fund.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Labor and Immigration Ahmed el-Amawi said the
ministry is currently working to write out 23,000 checks for
those who are to take advantage of this first tranche.
</P>
<P>
The total of the reparations which are overdue for Egyptians
is up to 823 million dollars, Amawi said, noting that the
remaining amount is to be transferred later with the continuous
selling of the Iraqi oil.
</P>
<P>
This move came within the context of the oil-for-food deal
concluded by the U.N. and Iraq in December to allow the latter
to sell 2 billion dollars of oil in six months to ease the impact
of trade sanctions imposed on Iraq for its August 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
In line with the deal, 30 percent of the Iraqi oil sales are
to be paid to people who lost their life savings or jobs due to
the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
In the first stage, 32 billion dollars will be paid to those
who were forced to leave Iraq and Kuwait during the war.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 23,300 Egyptians will get 58.3 million dollars
from the delivery.
</P>
<P>
The total of the reparations, estimated at 200 billion
dollars, will be paid out of the returns of Iraq's oil sales over
20 years.
</P>
<P>
Iraq will have access to about 1.3 billion dollars over six
months after funneling 30 percent to the fund for Gulf War
reparations and meeting other U.N. costs.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. fund is expected to take several years in examining
the papers of those who have demanded to be compensated for their
losses in the war.
</P>
<P>
In the 90 days till March 10, Iraq exported 52.3 million
barrels of oil worth an estimated 1.07 billion dollars, including
pipeline fees to Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Equatorial Guinea's Opposition Party to End Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The delegation of the Social
Democratic Coalition of Equatorial Guinea, an opposition party
founded seven years ago, will end its visit to Mozambique next
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, led by the party's chairman Santiago Obama,
arrived at Mozambique Friday at the invitation of Mozambique's
ruling party Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO).
</P>
<P>
Obama was quoted by Mozambican Information Agency as saying
here today that FRELIMO may associate his party's political
activities while his party will try to keep constant contacts
with FRELIMO.
</P>
<P>
Obama himself has held talks with FRELIMO's chief Manuel Tome
over these issues.
</P>
<P>
FRELIMO, set up in 1962, has rich experiences and enjoys a
high international fame. It is believable and can be an example
for many African parties for it has done a lot since the
anti-colonization era, Obama praised.
</P>
<P>
He added there are a lot of things for his party, which
started to develop relations with FRELIMO three years ago, to
learn from FRELIMO as a part of its preparation for joining
Equatorial Guinea's forthcoming elections.

<HEADLINE> Palestine Accuses Israel of Using Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Minister for Higher Education of
the Palestinian National Authority Hanan Ashrawi said here today
that Israel was exploiting the peace process to confiscate more
Palestinian land and to build and expand settlements.
</P>
<P>
"The peace process has become a unilateral process of power
politics which Israel exploits to confiscate more Palestinian
land, to build and expand settlements, to consolidate its illegal
annexation of occupied Jerusalem and to complete the siege and
isolation of the city," Ashrawi said.
</P>
<P>
She was speaking at the 53rd session of the United Nations
Commission on Human Rights. She was at last allowed to speak at
the session as an honored guest after a long discussion on whether
she could speak from the podium in the hall.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian-Israeli peace process is in serious jeopardy,
violence is unleashed on our world claiming the lives of innocents
on both sides, the extremism of the Israeli government is feeding
extremist elements among us, and the peace partnership which we
have so painfully and painstakingly sought to build is now being
dissolved in favor of a relationship of occupier-occupied,"
Ashrawi said.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi said that Israel was unilaterally preempting the
outcome of permanent status issues and flagrantly reneging on the
Interim Phase agreements by continuing to hold hostage more than
3,000 Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the session today, an Israeli representative said
that what was accused by Ashrawi of having been happening "simply
does not exist." "Palestinians have never given up terror," the
representative claimed, adding that peace could only be reached by
talks.

LONDON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) executive
Commission President Jacques Santer today voiced his conviction
that the European Monetary Union (EMU) would be launched as
planned on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC radio interview today, Santer dismissed
suggestions that even Germany, the powerhouse of European
integration, might not be ready in time and the Maastricht
Treaty's criteria for EMU entry would be fudged.
</P>
<P>
"I am quite confident that it will start on time on the basis
of the criteria of Maastricht and with a significant number of
(EU) member states," he said.
</P>
<P>
Santer made it clear that Germany and France would start in the
first wave to join the EMU, but he added there was hard work to be
done in achieving the target.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether there would have to be fudging if some EU
countries such as Spain and Italy were to make it in time, he
said, "No, we are not fudging the criteria. Not at all."

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's national blood stocks
have improved significantly this year with the National Blood
Transfusion Service (NBTS) meeting at least 80 percent of the
national needs as hiv sero-prevalence among regular donors
declines.
</P>
<P>
NBTS medical director Macleod Chitiyo said today the high
prevalence of hiv infection in the community had no impact on
blood donations.
</P>
<P>
"The hiv sero-prevalence in blood donors is actually going
down. The increasing cases of hiv have had no impact on blood
donations as evidenced by the number of blood collections which
have risen from 74,000 in 1994/95 to 77,000 in 1995/96," Chitiyo
said.
</P>
<P>
Chitiyo said hiv sero-positivity among donors had dropped from
2.24 percent in 1995 to 1.54 percent last year while the rate
among regular donors was even lower at about 0.52 percent.
</P>
<P>
Hiv prevalence levels among the 16 to 19 years age group
donors, mostly school children, had also dropped from 0.81
percent in 1995 to 0.68 percent in 1996.

LUSAKA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The number of new cases of

13 percent of adult deaths in Zambia and the spread of the
disease has been on the increase in the country.
</P>
<P>
He called for a dual strategy of tb control and hiv/Aids
prevention since the Aids pandemic and the tb epidemic are locked
in a vicious circle of mutual reinforcement.

He challenged the mass media to sensitise the public on the
need to eradicate tb while publicizing the hiv/Aids pandemic.

<HEADLINE> City Experts Call for Honest Manifestos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The incoming government will be
forced to ration health care and make savage cuts in education and
social security or raise taxes swiftly, a panel of independent
economic experts from the City warned today.
</P>
<P>
They argued that pledges made both by the Conservative and
Labor for tight controls on public spending are unworkable because
of the level of services promised to and expected by the voters.
</P>
<P>
In an open letter to the top civil servant at the Treasury, Sir
Terence Burns, the panel of six leading experts urged a more
"honest" and realistic course than the parties' manifestos will
set out.
</P>
<P>
They warned, "We have reached a point where the `normal
approach' of promising spending cuts without any drop in the
quality of the services and no higher costs for the consumer
cannot be maintained over the next few years."
</P>
<P>
"The only choices are a significant degradation of the current
level of services or sweeping changes to the three biggest and
most politically sensitive areas of public spending -- social
security, health and education," the experts added.
</P>
<P>
If the incoming government ignores the challenge by refusing to
raise taxes, the public will have to pay directly for services
which have been offered free since the founding of the welfare
state 50 years ago, they expected.
</P>
<P>
One of the experts in the panel, Penelope Rowlatt, director of
National Economic Research Associates, said that rationing of
health care would become more stringent, probably at the expense
of the elderly.
</P>
<P>
She suggested, "Anyone approaching their 60th birthday would be
well advised to consider taking out private health insurance while
they are still healthy enough to be accepted."
</P>
<P>
"We should ask ourselves urgently whether the two-tier system
that will result is the system we wish to live with in this
country," she added.

<HEADLINE> Council of Europe to Protect Aid to Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Council of Europe today
welcomed the ongoing efforts of certain European Union member
states to assemble a multinational protection force for Albania to
help create a secure environment for the safe provision of
international assistance.
</P>
<P>
In a series of draft conclusions adopted here today, the
council also considered it important to assist Albania in the
re-establishment of a viable police force and decided that the EU
would support this process through certain appropriate measures
such as training.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of the report of the EU mission that visited
Albania from March 17 to 19, the council agreed that the EU had a
"very substantial" role to play in helping the country to return
to political stability and internal security.
</P>
<P>
The council decided to take the initiative to set up an
advisory mission to Albania to advise on humanitarian, economic,
political and security-related developments.
</P>
<P>
In order to prepare the ground for the advisory mission, the
council said that it would dispatch an advance team without delay.
The advance team, to which representatives of other international
organizations will be invited, would make recommendations on the
composition of the advisory mission and facilitate the arrival of
humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
The council stressed that economic and financial support would
also be subject to the re-establishment of the necessary secure
environment in Albania, an Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) member country.
</P>
<P>
The council also stressed the importance of assisting this
process through appropriate monitoring and considered that the
European Community Monitoring Mission could make a contribution to
this effort.
</P>
<P>
However, up to now, both the scale and the nature of the
multinational force remain to be decided.

<HEADLINE> TB Cases on Increase in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 24 (Xinhua) -- There has been a drastic
increase of Tuberculosis cases from 15,000 to 44,000 victimes for
the past 10 years in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The Minister for Health, A. Chiduo said this at Temeke
Hospital in the city today on an event marking world TB day with
this year's theme "Directly Observed Treatment, Short course"
(DOTS) insisting close supervision on a victim.
</P>
<P>
The minister said TB had reached an alarming rate in the
country because of AIDS which started being widely spread in
1984, thus deteriolating people's immunity "defence" against the
infectious disease.
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania was among the first countries in Africa which
launched a special program to curb TB and leprosy in 1977. He
said the program was a great success with tremendous decrease in
TB cases from 1981 to 1983 but the achievement was interrupted by
AIDS in 1984.
</P>
<P>
The minister said, despite the increased costs in TB
treatment, the government will coninue offering the treatment
services free of charge because of the sensitivity of the disease
to the country and the world.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he urged local and international donors to assist
the government with funds for fighting against the disease.
</P>
<P>
The minister paid tribute to world health organisation (WHO),
other donor countries and international donor agencies for their
supports.
</P>
<P>
The WHO representative to Tanzania, Dirk Warning said the WHO
was concerned about the alarming rate of TB victims in Tanzania
and would do its best by ensuring that TB facilities and
essential drugs were available, reaching the target group in
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
He commended Tanzania for its speical programs against TB and
for putting into profitable use of aid from donors.

<HEADLINE> EU Calls for Final Push on Deregulation in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The European Union is calling on
Japan to further open its market as the Japanese government
prepares a final round of deregulation measures in one week's
time.
</P>
<P>
Horse-racing, car parts, transport services,
telecommunications, fresh fruit and starch are among the issues
where the EU is urging Japan to open its market, said a press
release issued here today.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive body, has engaged
in intensive discussions with Japan in order to encourage Tokyo to
take comprehensive deregulation measures in areas of interest to
European business.
</P>
<P>
"The European Commission attaches particular importance to
efforts by Japan to deregulate its economy and improve the
business environment for all companies," Sir Leon Brittan, EU
commissioner for relations with Japan, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Japanese government to make determined efforts so
that "real and tangible" results will emerge in line with Japan's
own ambitions to create a more open economy.
</P>
<P>
He noted that progress had been made on insurance, electrical
equipment, cosmetics and other areas, but the commission is
calling for one final push to deregulate other markets where
European exports to Japan are hindered.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government is due to publish the final revision of
its current three-year deregulation program at the end of March.
The EU is making a final push in the run-up in order to make the
best of it for its economic interests.
</P>
<P>
One type of market access restriction in Japan that is of
particular concern to the EU is the regulatory system which
governs business. The Japanese economy is characterized by a
complex web of regulations that restrict business opportunities.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Starts to Evacuate Its Citizens in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Belgium today began to evacuate
its citizens from Zaire, its war-torn former colony, by airlifting
paratroopers to the African country.
</P>
<P>
A total of 550 Belgian soldiers will be flown to Brazzaville,
capital of the Congo, which lies just across the Zaire river from
the Zairean capital Kinshasa, in this so-called "Green Stream"
operation.
</P>
<P>
An army spokesman was quoted as saying that the soldiers would
not move into the Zairean capital unless there was a need to do
so. In Brazzaville, the Belgian soldiers will join 650 U.S. and 40
French soldiers who are ready to evacuate their nationals.
</P>
<P>
As rebels led by Laurent Kabila have captured one fifth of the
country, Zaire's 66-year-old president Mobutu Sese Seko, who is
gravely ill with cancer, is standing another fatal risk of being
overthrown.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 7,000 Westerners are waiting to be evacuated in
Zaire, where tension is running high. There are 3,000 Belgians in
the country, including 1,150 in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian news agency Belga quoted Jean-Pol Poncelet, the
Belgian defense minister, as saying that the mission could last
more than a month. But another army official said no deadline had
actually been set.

<HEADLINE> Asia Car Production in Excess of Demand: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Asia's car production capacity is
growing far in excess of forecast demand in the region, creating a
risk of a serious shake-out by the end of the decade, according to
a survey by DRI/McGraw Hill.
</P>
<P>
Capacity in Southeast Asia is expected to rise to over 3
million units by 2000 from 1.6 million units in 1995, thanks in
large measure to substantial investment in Thailand by GM, Ford,
Mazda, Honda, Mitsubishi and Nissan, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
"With all manufacturers having very ambitious plans to increase
capacity and exports, we expect excess capacity to become a major
issue in almost every Asian country by the end of the decade,"
said Ashvin Chotai, author of the survey.
</P>
<P>
Top vehicle manufacturers achieve capacity utilization rates of
more than 85 percent from their plants in developing Asia. By the
year 2000, they will find it hard to achieve rates of 75 percent,
the survey expected.
</P>
<P>
Across the region as a whole, capacity utilization is expected
to drop to 57 percent in 2000 from 67 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
A particularly sharp drop is expected in South Korea where
capacity is likely to grow rapidly as a result of Samsung entering
the industry in 1998 and Sangyong's planned increase in
production. Capacity use may drop to 52 percent by 2001 from 72
percent in 1995, the survey said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish national was charged
here today with espionage and a bomb attack against the premises of
a Kurdish cultural center.
</P>
<P>
According to Cyprus news agency today, the Limassol District
Court ordered Nedjip Srichichekli, 45, arrested two weeks ago,
to remain in police custody until March 31, when he will
appear before the Court for a preliminary hearing.
</P>
<P>
The defendant was refused bail by the Court for fear that
he might escape to the northern Turkish occupied part of the
island.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the Court said Srichichekli was
charged with placing explosives in the Kurdish Association's
premises, in the southern town of Limassol, and with possession
of explosives, a time bomb, plastic explosives and a detonator
on February 10, 1996.
</P>

Konor and Dijan Nejip, a Turkish Cypriot, were arrested and
remanded in custody on March 8, on suspicion of spying on
Cyprus' security and military positions, but Konor and Nejip

landed and seized northern third of the island in the wake
of a short-lived Greek Cypriot coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Urges Expatriate Businessmen to Help Homeland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Egypt kicked off the 5th Conference
for Egyptian Businessmen Abroad here today, calling on the corps
of expatriate investors to make greater contributions to the
country's development.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 Egyptian businessmen based either in Egypt or
abroad, together with seven cabinet ministers and 10 governors,
took part in the two-day annual conference that aims at
encouraging Egyptian businessmen abroad to join the all-embracing
development process in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
In his inaugural speech, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of
Agriculture Yousef Wali shed light on the new investment incentive
packages the government plans to offer to investors.
</P>
<P>
The draft law, to be examined by the People's Assembly in the
ensuing two days, includes an array of incentives, guarantees and
exemptions for investors. Privileges particularly designed for
Egyptian investors abroad will be highlighted.
</P>
<P>
The proposed legislation, according to Wali, guarantees that no
confiscation, sequestration or nationalization of investment
projects or capital will be made to protect the interests of
investors.
</P>
<P>
Wali said a 20-year tax break is offered to investors who set
up projects in the southern Nile Valley or move their existing
ventures to the new communities.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Egypt gives investors full freedom to set up
projects without prior approvals by the General Investment
Authority. Reductions in customs duties will be also offered to
investors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egypt also made an attempt to clear its image
tarnished by terrorist attacks in the country, including a shooting
incident at the Europa Hotel in Cairo that killed 18 Greek
tourists last April and an attack in Qena province, which 14 lives
last week.
</P>
<P>
At the opening, Minister of Interior Hassan al-Alfy assured the
investors that terrorism leaderships have "finally" been uprooted
and stability prevails in the country.
</P>
<P>
Egypt wants the businessmen to take part in the giant
investment ventures launched by the government, such as the New
Valley Project and the Upper Egypt Development Project.
</P>
<P>
It also expect them to introduce new ideas to the country's
economic reform program and give a hand in increasing production,
augmenting exports and creating new jobs.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Calls for US Just Role in Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon called today for a "just
and pushing" role of the United States in the Middle East peace
process, and warned of a "collapse" of the process and
Washington's credibility.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz stressed here this
afternoon that what has been achieved in the peace process
generally and in the Palestinian-Israeli track particularly is
"threatened."
</P>
<P>
"We have reached a stage where even what has been
achieved on the level of the Oslo Accord, and that of the
Hebron Agreement, has become threatened," the Lebanese foreign
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz left here this afternoon for Morocco's capital of
Rabat to attend a conference of the Jerusalem Committee, and
then, on Saturday, for Cairo to participate in the conference
of Arab foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
At the Beirut International Airport, the foreign minister
reiterated a fear over a "collapse of the peace process and the
credibility of the U.S. role, which had been supposed to be one
of a just mediator and a pushing power, with the veto it used in
the Security Council."
</P>
<P>
At the United Nations Friday, the U.S. cast its second veto in
two weeks to kill a security council resolution demanding that
Israel halt work on building 6,500 homes for Jews at Arab East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"A return of the U.S. to the role demanded for it in
the peace process is the guarantee for a return of the peace
process to its natural track after it has actally entered
a big dangerous circle," Boueiz pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that Jerusalem is an integrated part of
Palestine and we consider a control over Jerusalem by Israel
an operation destroying one of the peace process' bases.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz announced that the Jerusalem Committee's conference to
be held in Rabat will focus on this issue and on the ways
to put an end to the Israeli project of building settlements
in Jerusalem and Judaizing this city.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister also called for an Arab
summit "in light of a gravity of the situation and in light
of the significance of what is happening and in light of a
split among the Arab states which has weakened the Arab
position."

<HEADLINE> Decisive Step Taken in Peace Progress in Angola: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
said today "a decisive and concrete step" has been taken in
Angola's peace process as the opposition UNITA promised to send
all its lawmakers and politicians to capital Luanda this week.
</P>
<P>
Annan said at the central city Bailundo he is satisfied with
the commitment by Jonas Savimbi, the leader of the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), saying Savimbi has
made the last and critical step toward peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
This time the southern African country will enjoy a lasting
peace and all parties involved should make necessary efforts to
realize it, Annan said after his 45-minute talks with Savimbi
held earlier today.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Savimbi told Annan the rest of the
parliamental members loyal to UNITA will arrive at Luanda Tuesday
and then take office.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA members who will join the government of national
unity and reconciliation is to arrive here Wednesday, said
Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Since the Angolan government has approved to discuss the new
government's administrative program before its creation,
"obstacles hindering the peace process no longer exist," he
claimed.
</P>
<P>
However, Savimbi ruled out any possibilities for himself to
attend the inauguration ceremony of the new government in Luanda
and gave no reasons.
</P>
<P>
Annan, arriving here Saturday, will end his four-day official
visit to Angola on Wednesday.

<P>
NICOSIA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Britain will give its full
support for the ongoing proximity talks conducted by a U.N.
resident representative in Cyprus with leaders of the Greek and
Turkish Cypriot communities, a British diplomat said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting with Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides,
British High Commissioner to Cyprus, David Madden, said: "we, and
I'm sure, other countries, are very supportive of this process
and we'll do everything we can to ensure the talks produce
results."
</P>
<P>
Madden, however, declined to comment either on the content of,
or progress in, the indirect talks between President Glafcos
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that U.N. representative Gustave Feissel is
looking into presenting a package of confidence-building measures
to both sides to build a measure of trust between the
long-divided communities.
</P>
<P>
The high commissioner also declined to reveal any details on
the package.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored proximity talks began on March 10, aimed at
breaking the current deadlock and paving the way for a
face-to-face meeting between President Clerides and Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a pessimistic assessment of a Cyprus solution
made in public by the Turkish Cypriot side, Madden said that "I
think what the important thing is what is said in private
and confidentially between U.N. representative Feissel and the
leaders of the two communities."
</P>
<P>
The Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides have agreed to limit
their public comments on the ongoing proximity talks.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot south and
the Turkish Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of an
Athens-backed coup.

<HEADLINE> Minister: Cyprus' Economy Shows Favorable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' economic prospects this
year will be much more favorable than those of 1996, based on
encouraging signs from tourism, services and other sectors,
Finance Minister Christodoulos Christodoulou said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Christodoulou said the rate
of growth in 1997 is expected to range between 3 and 3.5 percent
of the gross domestic product (GDP), higher than that of the
European Union, expected to be about 2.5 to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Finance minister noted that his optimism was based on
government measures aimed at improving the island's economy and
on an increasing trend of the general economic indicators.
</P>
<P>
"Prospects for the services sector are much better, while
tourist bookings for this year are expected to be at 1996 levels
with a view for improvement," Christodoulou noted.
</P>
<P>
Commerce, Industry and Tourism Minister Kyriakos Christofi
also said today that despite negative indications at the
beginning of the year, Cyprus's tourism is now experiencing
an upward trend from markets such as Britain, the Scandinavian
countries and Russia.
</P>
<P>
This was the result of an international promotion plan, which
started last year and is still under way, the minister said, but
he did not specify.
</P>
<P>
About two million tourists visit the island every year,
enabling the country to earn around 1.6 billion U.S. dollars. The
tourism sector represents some 21 percent of the gross national
product (GNP).
</P>
<P>
Referring to the manufacturing sector, the Finance minister
said there have been encouraging signs since the incentives and
the financing of export projects started being implemented.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that the agricultural sector has been
affected by bad weather conditions, which led to millions of
Cyprus pounds worth of losses.
</P>
<P>
This Eastern Mediterranean island, which covers its water
needs to a great extent from annual rainfall, has been hit by a
continuing drought as the water supplies in reservoirs are at
their worst record in the past 10 years.

LOME, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials from Togo's
Ministery of Communication revealed here today that their
government has invited both Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko
and rebel leader Laurent Kabila to participate in the Lome OAU
summit to be held on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the host Togo has not received any formal reply
from both the warring sides, the officials added.
</P>
<P>
According to French International Radio monitored here, Kabila
said today that he will send a delegation for the extraordinary
summit of the Organization of African Unity which will focus on
the Zaire crisis.
</P>
<P>
But the officials of Togo said that they could not confirm the
report, because they have not received any reply from the Zairean
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that Kabila himself will absolutely not be
present at the summit.
</P>
<P>
It is not known whether President Mobutu will come or not, but
a delegation of the Zairean government is sure to come, according
to the officials.
</P>

Another report said that the United States has pressed on
Mobutu to talk with Kabila.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Ready to Send Troops to Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Turkey said today that it
was ready to send troops for any kind of international military
operation in turbulent Albania.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry Deputy Spokesman Sermet Atacanli told
a regular press conference that Turkey was deeply concerned
about the grave situation in the Balkan country and would like
to make efforts for the settlement of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We did indicate that Turkey is ready and willing to
participate in any kind of military operation that will be
designed to assist Albania, " Atacanli said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Turkey took such a stand due to its
traditional friendship with the Albanian people, adding Ankara had
started its humanitarian supplies shippings to Albania.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a high-level diplomatic group led by Foreign
Ministry Undersecretary Onur Oymen arrived in Tirana, capital of
Albania, earlier the same day in an effort to show Turkey's
concern for the developments in the region.
</P>
<P>
After his arrival, Oymen said that Turkey believed that
Albania could solve its problems and the current crisis by
itself, but added that Ankara was ready to participate in any
international effort for the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
Oymen carried a letter from Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
to Albania's President Sali Berisha which reportedly called for
calm and reason in the country.
</P>
<P>
A written statement issued by the Foreign Ministry earlier
today said that Turkey had already undertaken diplomatic
initiatives within the framework of international organizations
concerned with the aim of securing peace in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Turkey signed a military cooperation agreement with Albania
in 1995 and has held several joint military exercises with the
Balkan country under NATO'S Partnership for Peace program.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government has reportedly appealed for police
units from abroad to help secure ports, airports, roads and
railways so that international relief supplies can be distributed
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Following several weeks of political turmoil, Albania, the
poorest country in Europe, came to the brink of a civil war
and also caused serious refugee problem, which aroused grave
concern from the international community.

<HEADLINE> German Steelmaker Krupp Gives Up Takeover Attempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Germany's steel concern Krupp-Hoesch
has completely given up its attempt to take over its larger rival
Thyssen, companies announced today.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued in Duesseldorf, both companies said
the talks between Krupp-Hoesch boss Gerhard Cromme and his Thyssen
counterpart Dieter Vogel are making "good progress" in negotiating
a merger of their steel operations.
</P>
<P>
"Participants agreed that such a fusion would improve the
survivability of Germany as a steel production base and would make
a forward-looking strategy possible," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thyssen spokesman Reiner Hochscheid said that the
cooperation between Thyssen and Krupp will lead to much less job
losses as compared to a takeover.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that due to the larger size of its steel
unit, Thyssen will assume the business leadership of the joint
Krupp-Thyssen steel operations.
</P>
<P>
With an annual steel output of 10.4 million tons, Thyssen is
the largest German steelmaker while Krupp-Hoesch ranked second
with an annual output of 7.5 million tons.
</P>
<P>
A merger of the two will create the largest steel group in
Europe and the fifth largest in the world, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
The merger talks between the two companies have been underway
since March 19 after the surprise announcement of Krupp's hostile
takeover bid met strong resistance from Thyssen's management, as
well as mass demonstrations from steelworkers who feared that a
takeover would pose a threat to 10,000 or more jobs.
</P>
<P>
While original protests mainly centered on Krupp, new
development over the weekend saw workers increasingly begin to
pour their anger at the country's two biggest banks, Deutsche Bank
and Dresdner Bank, which have backed the Krupp takeover moves by
piecing together a 15 billion marks (about 13 billion U.S.
dollars) financial package for the bid.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, more than 30,000 steelworkers are expected to hold
a mass rally in the country's banking capital, Frankfurt to
protest at the role played by the two banks. Latest news reports
said that despite Krupp's pullback of the takeover bid, the
protest rally will go as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to Frankfurt because we fear that our future
cannot be helped by the democratically elected government in Bonn
but will instead be decided by the banks," said Georg Bongen,
Thyssen's trade union leader.
</P>
<P>
Despite the failure of the takeover attempt, about 7,000 jobs
are still expected to be lost under the steel merger Krupp and
Thyssen are trying to create this week, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> African Countries Urged to Eradicate Rinderpest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A Kenyan minister today called
for continental cooperation in rinderpest control in order to
increase livestock production, a Kenya News Agency report said
today.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Minister for Agriculture, Livestock Development and
Marketing Darius Mbela was speaking at the opening of Pan African
Rinderpest Campaign meeting held at Machakos, 70 kilometers south
of Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the disease of rinderpest had already
been eradicated in West and Central Africa by 1988 as a result of
the efforts made by the Pan African Rinderpest Campaign.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, the disease is still threatening the
livestock in certain areas in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to a report issued recently by the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO), last October the disease of
rinderpest was detected in the Nairobi National Park.
</P>
<P>
In November last year, the Kenyan government notified FAO of
the outbreak of rinderpest which was later detected in its
neighboring country of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Kenyan government has carried out a
vaccination campaign against the disease from central Kenya to
districts bordering Tanzania with 1.1 million head of cattle
vaccinated.
</P>
<P>
In 1994/95 Kenya experienced an outbreak of rinderpest which
resulted in a loss of about 50 percent of the buffalo and 80
percent of the kudu population in West Tsavo National Park.

<HEADLINE> Annan Recommends Three-Month Extension of UN Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Annan recommended on Monday a three-month extension, until June
30, of the 92-member U.N. Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL),
which he said should now focus on elections set for May 30.
</P>
<P>
"Whereas much remains to be done and it is essential to remain
alert to the dangers that still persist, the prospects for peace
in Liberia now seems to be more promising than at any time since
the start of the civil war," Annan said in a report to the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"The main focus of UNOMIL must now be the forthcoming
elections," he said.
</P>
<P>
The elections are a key element of a peace accord signed at
Abuja, Nigeria, last August after more than a dozen previous
agreements broke down. More than 150,000 people have been killed
in the civil war, which has devastated Liberia's mining and rubber
economy.
</P>
<P>
In the report, Annan also appealed for donor countries to
provide assistance to a 10,000-strong peacekeeping force called
ECOMOG fielded by the Economic Community of West African States.
</P>
<P>
He said that ECOMOG is the key to the provision of adequate
security for the elections.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Denies Iraqi Claim on Information About </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait today denied Iraq's
claims that it had provided information about 300 Kuwaiti
detainees in Iraqi jails to the International Commission in
Charge of the Humanitarian Issue.
</P>
<P>
Acting Chairman of the Kuwaiti National Committee for Missing
and POWs Affairs (NCMPA) Ibrahim Majed Al-Shaheen said in a
statement that "out of over 600 files presented by Kuwait
concerning Kuwaiti and third nationals detained by the Iraqis
since the 1990-91 aggression against Kuwait, the Iraqis gave
incomplete replies about no more than 120 files."
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi daily Jomhoria said today that "Iraq has offered
information about 300 of 600 missing persons claimed by Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait in the Gulf War."
</P>
<P>
The NCMPA statement noted that replies on the 120 files
included Baghdad's acknowledgment of their arrest and transfer
to Iraq without giving additional details concerning their fate.
</P>
<P>
It said "Kuwait asserts that Iraq is required, from both the
legal and the humanitarian aspects, to provide complete
information concerning the fate of all Kuwaiti, Saudi and third
nationals detained and returned them to their homes and
families."
</P>
<P>
There are 604 Kuwaiti and third country prisoners in Iraq,
according to files prepared by Kuwait. But Iraq denied it had
detained such a number of Kuwaiti prisoners in its
jails. Baghdad gave replies concerning files of 128 Kuwaiti
POWs between February 23, 1994 and February 11, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Iraq also returned the remains of one Kuwaiti prisoner last
year.
</P>
<P>
The International Commission formed by representatives from
the United States, Britain, France, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and
Iraq hold meetings on solving the POW problem every other month
interchangeably on each side of the Kuwait-Iraqi border. But so
far no big headway has been made.
</P>
<P>
"As to Iraq's claims of forming an Iraqi National Committee
to search for Kuwaiti and Saudi missing persons, Kuwait would
like to emphasize that it judges results but no claims," the
NCMPA statement said.
</P>
<P>
It added "the only legally and internationally acceptable
result is the release of these prisoners and the end of this
humanitarian problem which is still hanging since the (1990)
Iraqi aggression against Kuwait."
</P>
<P>
The issue of POWs is a one of the key problems blocking the
way to improvement of bilateral relations between the two Arab
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Settlement of the issue is one of the conditions set by
Kuwait and the United States for lifting the U.N. sanctions
imposed on Iraq since its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> TB Cases Increase in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The number of registered new
tuberculosis sufferers reached nearly 20,000 in Mozambique last
year, up 743 from 18,482 in 1995, according to data issued today
by the National Tuberculosis Control Program (PNCT).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the PNCT predicted that the TB cases will continue
to go up this year.
</P>
<P>
The highest 1996 TB-occurrence rate was seen in the northern
Nampula province where 3338 people suffered from the disease.
</P>
<P>
Nampula was followed by the central Sofala province with 3071
TB patients and the southern Maputo province with 2990, according
to the data.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, the south, with 7172 TB victims, was hit most
seriously by the disease. The central region had 7030 TB patients
last year while the north had 5953.
</P>
<P>
The TB cure rate and death rate stood at 69 and 5.4 percent
respectively in 1996 around the southern African country where
16.8 percent of TB patients gave up treatment.
</P>
<P>
The capital city of Maputo enjoyed a 85.4 percent cure rate,
the highest in the country. The TB death rate hit 1.8 percent in
the city.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique has to spend more than one million U.S. Dollars on
fighting the TB disease every year.
</P>
<P>
However, the country's fight against TB is much complicated by
its over-concentrated population, its inadequacy of medicine
facilities and experts and the low educational level of patients,
local reports said.

OTTAWA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Three woman and two men found dead
in a house fire at Saint-Casimir, Quebec, were victims of a
suicide pact linked to the Solar Temple cult, police have
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
The bodies were uncovered by fire-fighters Saturday evening
after neighbors saw flames coming from the farmhouse at
Saint-Casimir, a village about 50 kilometers southwest of Quebec
City, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Three teenagers were found drugged, but unharmed in a work-shed
on the property. Three of the dead were their parents and
grandmother.
</P>
<P>
Police are hoping that interviews with the teens can help shed
some light on the operations of the cult, which has claimed 74
lives in Europe and Quebec since 1994.
</P>
<P>
No marks of violence were found on the five bodies, which were
not burned by the fire. Police say they do not yet know exact
causes of the death.
</P>
<P>
Autopsies will be performed today and tomorrow in Montreal.
"We'll have to conduct autopsies and toxicology tests before we
know exactly how they died," police was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's incident was almost identical to a 1994 fire in
Morin Heights, north of Montreal, in which the bodies of five
members of the Solar Temple sect were found, according to the

<HEADLINE> Camerounians Urged to Curb TB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Minister of Public Health of
Cameroun Titus Edzoa called here today, the World Tuberculosis
(TB) Day, on all Camerounians to fight against the disease, the
number one adult killer in the country.
</P>
<P>
Cameroun observed the day under the theme "the Directly
Observed Treatment Short Course" (DOTS), a strategy developed by
the World Health Organization (WHO) to eradicate the disease.
</P>
<P>
Under the strategy, health workers watch patients swallowing
each dose of the medicine for the first two months of the
treatment and monitoring their progress towards curing.
</P>
<P>
The strategy can reportedly help eliminate all the bacteria at
the source and equally stops the experience of the TB case with
the multi-resistance bacteria.
</P>
<P>
In Cameroun, the number of TB cases increased from about 4,000
in 1987 to 20,000 in 1997, said Edzoa.
</P>
<P>
He said the rise was due to the late detection, especially the
fact that patients do not follow the treatment to the end and are
not well taken care of by the health service.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics from the Ministry of Public Health
showed that only 45 percent of TB patients regularly follow their
treatment until they are cured.
</P>
<P>
Edzoa noted that the ministry has undertaken to intensify the
National TB Control Program.
</P>
<P>
The WHO estimated that TB killed 30 million people this decade
and each year about eight million new TB cases and three million
death caused by TB are recorded worldwide.

CAIRO, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Bosnian Prime Minister
Haris Silajdzic today called for preservation of Jerusalem as the
spiritual capital of world's three major religions.
</P>
<P>
Silajdzic, emerging from his meeting with Egyptian President

Jerusalem.
</P>

well," he said, reiterating the necessity of preserving the
cultural character of Jerusalem as a spiritual capital for all
religions.
</P>
<P>

Croats, during which 250,000 people were killed and 2 million left
homeless.
</P>
<P>
Saying that Bosnia, with the population of Sunni Muslims
accounting for 43,7 percent, is still facing political challenges
from within. He urged the international community and the major
powers to grasp the real crux of the situation in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"It is not a mere local or regional issue but an international
affairs one," he added.
</P>
<P>
The civil war had claimed the lives of 200,000 Bosnians and the
Serbs had destroyed more than 1,000 mosques, according to Silajdzic.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Silajdzic expressed the hope to cement ties with
Egypt in various domains where Egypt has a rich experience.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will sign three agreements on economic,
scientific and technical cooperation, on encouraging trade and
investments protection, added Silajdzic, who arrived here Monday on
a five-day visit leading a big delegation from the Bosnian Chamber
of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmed Goweili, on his
part, said that negotiations are underway between the two sides to
export Egyptian medicine, raw cotton and other goods to Bosnia,
while the Egyptian construction sector is also participating in
the re-construction program of Bosnia, he said.

<HEADLINE> Manila, Communist Party Make Headway in Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and the
Philippine Communist Party have made a breakthrough in their
stalled peace talks held in the Netherlands, the official
Philippine News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough was achieved after Speaker of the Philippine
House of Representatives Jose de Venecia held one-on-one talks
with top communist leader Jose Sison Monday night in Amsterdam,
capital of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, they signed a historic joint statement which
promised to complete negotiations and sign a final peace agreement
on or before June 30 this year, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
This was the first joint statement signed by Sison and a
government mediator in the course of talks aimed at ending the
27-year insurgency by the communist-led National Democratic Front,
according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia, who went to the Netherlands at the invitation of
exiled Philippine Communist leader Sison, reported the
breakthrough in the on-and-off negotiations immediately to
Philippine President Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
The exploratory peace talks between the Philippine Communist
Party and the government, which resumed earlier this month, have
been stalled over some humanitarian and human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Communist Party has been opposed to the
government since its creation in the 1970s. Some of the party's
top leaders fled to the Netherlands after its New People's Army
suffered major military setbacks in the early 1990s.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Agents from the Tokyo prosecutors
office and the Securities Exchange Surveillance Commission (SEC)
raided Nomura Securities Co. and related facilities today in a bid
to find further evidence of shady dealings with corporate
racketeers.
</P>
<P>
About 150 agents from the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors
Office and about 30 SEC agents conducted the multiple search
operation that included the Nomura headquarters, the Tokyo
apartment of former corporate racketeer Ryuichi Koike and the
Yokyoama home of Shinpei Matsuki, one of the two senior Nomura
executives involved in the case, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors office and the SEC launched the search on
suspicion that the leading brokerage house illegally funneld 38
million yen (about 317,000 U.S. dollars) in profits from
discretionary stock deals into the account of a realtor linked to
Koike, the news service said.
</P>
<P>
Nomura Securities announced March 6 that it had found out about
the banned discretionary stock deals sometime in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Two managing directors directly involved in the deals resigned
March 10, while the company's president, Hideo Sakamaki, announced
March 14 that he was stepping down to take the blame.
</P>
<P>
An internal investigation has shown that an account was opened
in the realtor's name in March 1993.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that profits from stock deals made by Nomura
Securities from its own accounts were transfered into the
realtor's account and that documents were falsified to suggest
otherwise.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Speed Former Rebels' Integration Into Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Armed Forces of the
Philippines and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MNLF) will
launch a joint information drive to speed the former rebels'
integration into the army, the Philippine News Agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Yano, deputy chief of state for Operations Office of
the army, today said the information drive aims to educate and
enlighten the army and MNLF forces on the awareness of the
government's peace process.
</P>
<P>
The information campaign has been recommended to Governor Nur
Misuari of the Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao and General
Arnulfo Acedera after the army encountered problems in the
implementation of the MNLF integration.
</P>
<P>
Yano said the inadequate information drive on the MNLF
integration into the army and the difficulty in disseminating the
program to MNLF forces in remote areas caused the delay in the
implementation of the integration.
</P>
<P>
While there may be some delay in the initial implementation of
the MNLF integration into the army, he said, the integration
process will continue.
</P>
<P>
In line with the peace agreement forged by the government and
the MNLF last September, a total of 5,750 MNLF members will join
the army. Of the total number, 250 members will be absorbed into
the auxiliary services.
</P>
<P>
As outlined in the plan, the integration of the 5,500 MNLF
members into the army will be completed within a three-year period
starting November 1, 1996.

<HEADLINE> China Respects and Protects Religious Freedom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- China respects and protects
religious freedom, and this is its fundamental policy in dealing
with religious affairs, the advisor of the Chinese delegation to
the 53rd session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights
said today.
</P>
<P>
Wang said, "Discrimination and exclusion in political,
economic, cultural and social life based on the belief or
non-belief in religion are not permitted (in China)."
</P>
<P>
He said that in China, a multi-religious country, there are
more than 100 million religious followers who believe in either
Buddhism, Taoism, Islamism, Catholicism or Christianity.
</P>
<P>
There are now over 2,000 religious groups, 200,000 teachers of
various religions, 40 religious institutes and schools, and more
than 70,000 sites of religious activity in the country, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that under China's Constitution, religious groups
are free to independently organize their religious activities and
teachings, publish religious periodicals, print and distribute
religious scriptures, and start religious schools to train young
theological professionals.
</P>
<P>
They are also allowed to conduct friendly exchanges with
foreign religious groups and personnel, attend international
religious conferences and seminars, and organize pilgrimages of
the Chinese Muslims to Mecca, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government protects all religious activities
carried out within the scope of the constitution and law," Wang
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
While enjoying their legal rights, citizens should also fulfill
their obligations which are set down in law, he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, "anyone engaging in activities endangering public
security and social order, thus violating others' fundamental
rights, will be punished in accordance with law. This is the
common practice of every modern state with the rule of law and has
nothing to do with whether one holds a religious belief or not,"
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"We all respect human rights, but we should proceed from the
actual conditions of each country to protect human rights,
strengthen exchanges and dialog among various countries and
regions, and avoid arrogance and prejudice," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang added that China is ready to work with the U.N. and other
countries, through efforts to protect religious freedom, to
contribute to world peace, social justice and friendly relations
among peoples of all countries.

death of comrade Deng Xiaoping, and said that they would carry out
Deng's will and stick to the reform and opening-up policies under
the leadship of the CPC central committee with Jiang Zemin at the

letter that on July 1, when Hong Kong will return to the embrace
of the motherland, will be a historical day marking the end of the
100 years of national humiliation.
</P>
<P>
Wei Xinghong from central China's Hubei province in his letter
wished the 15th conference of CPC would keep to the Party's good
traditions and way of doing things, to forge ahead into the future
with one heart and one mind.
</P>
<P>
Still in other letters people gave their comments and advice on
many important issues of common concern. A letter from Deng
Zhibang of south China's Guangdong province, for example, said
that the gap between the rich and the poor in society should be
narrowed as soon as possible, and the anti-corruption drive should
be further enhanced.
</P>
<P>
Many letters were written by farmers. They expressed their wish
for lightening the financial burdens on them and attaching more
importance to the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
According to the Letters and Calls Group of the 5th session of
the 8th NPC, all these letters had been carefully handled, many
had been published on bulletins, and some had been sent to the
related authorities.
</P>

"We will do our best to play the role of bridge and tie between
the people and the state departments," said an member with the

Trees planted in the Longbei Hill can not only maintain a good
ecology, but also purify the water source as well as increase the
quality of the water, he added.

be a benefit for future generations, and it is meaningful that the
PLA officers and men can do such a good deed for the people of
Hong Kong before stationed there.
</P>
<P>
The trees planted by the PLA soldiers today are good-quality
fast-growing trees imported from Australia. A tropical rain forest
is expected to form on Longbei Hill just within a couple of
years.

MACAO, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The increasing number of
automobiles in Macao has caused a wide-spread concern in the
territory.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics from the Macao Municipal
Council, there are 720,000 motor vehicles running in the streets.
That means about one motor vehicle for every six people in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Local residents and municipal officials said that although the
increase of cars symbolizes a social prosperity, it has caused
negative effects on Macao, which cannot be deleted by prosperity
itself.
</P>
<P>
Traffic jams, noises, exhaust emissions, mushrooming garages in
crowded streets and increasing number of deserted cars have been
among the biggest complaints from local residents.
</P>
<P>
Leong Heng Kau, a member of the Macao Municipal Council, told
local newspaper "Va Kio" that comprehensive measures should be
taken to curb the problems caused by the increase of motors.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that experts discuss issues concerning the
restrictions on the number of new cars, management of parking lots
within buildings, designation of areas for deserted cars, building
of more overpasses, setup of special lanes for buses and special
parking area for motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
"Government departments should pay special attention to the
growing problem of the 'blood vessels of the city,'" he said.
"They should make joint efforts to keep that vessel flowing."

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 25 (Xinhua) -- German employers today appealed for
a reduction in their social welfare taxes to cut labor costs and
help boost employment.
</P>
<P>
They are demanding a cut in social welfare payments, which
cover pensions, unemployment benefit, health and nursing care,
from 42 percent of average gross salary to 38 percent by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
Under German law, employers pay half the amount and employees
pay the other half through deductions from their monthly wage. Now
they say these taxes should be reduced to boost employment.
</P>
<P>
"Those who want to put the jobless back to work must see that
labour costs are reduced and that employment becomes more flexible,"
the Federation of German Employers said in a strategy paper presented
in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
The employers warned Chancellor Helmut Kohl that his goal of
cutting German unemployment by half by 2000 was likely to fail.
</P>
<P>
Official data showed that Germany's unemployment rose to a
post-1930s record of 4.67 million people in February, or 12.2
percent of the work force.
</P>
<P>
The employers also called for a reform of the country's system
which requires companies in the same sector to pay the same amount
of social welfare tax regardless of companies' profit records.
</P>
<P>
They also proposed changing the unemployment benefit system to
encourage people to return to work rather than depend on welfare.

</P>
<P>
They also discussed latest international political

</P>
<P>
Observers here noted the contact was made amidst grave
concern from the Arab countries including Kuwait on the Middle
East peace process after Israel, a U.S. key ally in the region,
started the building of a Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem,
which sparked wide and strong opposition from the Arab Islamic
world.
</P>

Albright also reiterated the U.S. firm policy towards Iraq,
reaffirming that Iraq should fully implement all Security
Council resolutions related to its August 1990 aggression of
Kuwait, KUNA said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. led a western allied military operation in the Gulf
War against Iraq in 1991 to drive Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and the U.S. signed a defense cooperation agreement in
1991 under which the latter was committed to the stability and
security of the small Gulf state where the U.S. gets a large part

BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A man convicted of armed robbery
of bank vehicles and two of his weapon suppliers were executed
today in Beijing, the Supreme People's Court announced.

The death sentence on Guo Song and Zhang Jianguo, two jobless
people from Beijing and northeast China's Heilongjiang Province,
and Nong Zhibao, a farm worker from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region in south China, was carried out this morning by the Beijing
No.1 Intermediate People's Court.
</P>
<P>
Between December 1995 and August 1996, Lu Xianzhou, an escaped
prisoner, aged 33, ganged up with Guo and made four armed
robberies of cash-delivering vehicles of several local banks,
seizing more than 1.8 million RMB yuan, 610,000 Japanese yen,

<P>
Lu was arrested by the police last September and fatally
wounded in resistance. He died in a hospital after confessing the
crimes.

<P>
According to his confession and other evidence, the Beijing
No.1 Intermediate People's Court sentenced Guo to death and
deprivation of political rights for robbery and theft, and passed
the same penalty on Zhang and Nong for illegally trading guns and
causing extremely serious consequences.
</P>

The other four men and a woman involved in the case were
convicted of illegal trading of guns, harboring criminals, and
concealing booty. They received punishments ranging from the death
penalty with two-year reprieve and deprivation of political
rights for life to three to seven years in prison.

<HEADLINE> UK World Trade Gap Narrows to 14m Pounds in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Britain achieved its best trading
performance in more than a decade last year, narrowing the trade
deficit on its balance of payments to 14 million pounds (22.5
million US dollars), the Office for National Statistics (ONS)
announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
This compares with a deficit of 3.74 billion pounds (6 billion
dollars) in 1995 and was the best trading position since 1985 when
Britain ran a surplus of 2.25 billion pounds (3.6 billion
dollars), the ONS said.
</P>
<P>
Britain's current account balance for the last three months of
1996 showed a surplus of 873 million pounds (1.4 billion
dollars), compared with a deficit of 293 million pounds (471.7
million dollars) in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
The final quarter figures were much better than the 400
million-pound (644 million dollars) deficit analysts had been
expecting.
</P>
<P>
The final quarter improvement was largely helped by a surplus
on trade in services, which rose to 1.94 billion pounds (3.1
billion US dollars) from 1.70 billion pounds (2.7 billion US
dollars) in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
Britain's deficit in visible goods also improved, dropping to
2.58 billion pounds (4.2 billion US dollars) in the fourth quarter
from 2.91 billion pounds (4.7 billion US dollars) in the third.
</P>
<P>
For 1996 as a whole, Britain ran a record 12.2 billion pounds
(19.6 billion US dollars) surplus on trade in invisibles which
includes trade in services such as finance and insurance, as well
as investment income earned by UK companies abroad.
</P>
<P>
The invisible surplus was eight billion pounds (12.9 billion US
dollars) in 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
Conservative Prime Minister John Major, fighting to win the
general election on May 1, welcomed the figures, saying that
"Britain is booming thanks to people's hard work and Conservative
policies."
</P>
<P>
He said that the world had put its faith in Britain's goods and
services, but added that this success would be put at risk by the
election of a Labor government.
</P>
<P>
The Labor party are well ahead of the Conservatives in the
opinion polls and are favorites to win the election.

<HEADLINE> China to Take Fierce Offensives Against Narcotics Crimes (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- China plans to mobilize the whole
of society to launch a series of swift, fierce offensives against
narcotics crimes in the coming years, a top anti-drug official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Breakthroughs must be made within three years in combating
narcotics-related crimes, and with our increasing efforts later
on, the goal of rooting out the drug problem shall be realized,"
said Tao Siju, head of the national leading group of the
anti-narcotics work.
</P>
<P>
Tao, who is also minister of public security, made the
announcement at a national anti-narcotics conference which began
today.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the country has made "remarkable achievements"
in curbing drug-related crimes, "but we still face a serious
situation."
</P>
<P>
He reviewed in the past six years, China uncovered 233,404
narcotics-related crimes -- with the number climbing by an average
of 52.6 percent annually -- seized 324,944 criminals, captured
21,471 kilograms of heroin, 12,606 kgs of opium, 8,491 kgs of
marijuana and 4,374 kgs of "ice."
</P>
<P>
Some 65,066 criminals were arrested, and 49,481 of them were
sentenced to jail, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Tao said, China set up 628 drug-rehabilitation
centers to offer mandatory treatment to 370,000 drug addicts in
the past six years. Eighty-six rehab camps run by the judicial
administrative bodies reformed over 100,000 drug-addicts through
labor during the same period.
</P>
<P>
The scarce planting of opium in some parts of the country
has been promptly eradicated upon discovery, Tao said.

NEW DELHI, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Indian Election Commissioner
G.V.G. Krishnamurty said today that presidential candidate should
be a towering personality with a sound track record and capable of
taking the nation ahead into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
President and vice-president are above politics and not
supposed to be nominees of any political party, he said while
addressing a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
The terms of the current president and vice-president expire on
July 24 and August 20 this year respectively.
</P>
<P>
The election commissioner sought a national debate on issues
relating to the coming presidential and vice-presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
He said that these issues would have to be considered in-depth
by every section of the society as the persons going to occupy
these two high offices would be symbolizing the trust of the
nation.
</P>
<P>
The tradition of any political party claiming to have its own
president must go, he said.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with India's constitution, president and
vice-president are not elected directly but by members of the
electoral college including all the MPs both in parliament and
state assemblies in the country.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Western Samoan Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng met with
Western Samoan Deputy Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi
here today, saying that China places importance to relations with
South Pacific island nations.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China will join efforts with all South Pacific
island nations including Western Samoa to maintain regional and
world peace and contribute to the prosperity of the Asia-Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
He said that Western Samoa is one of the first countries in
South Pacific that establish diplomatic relations with China.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the past 22 years since the two countries were
linked diplomatically, bilateral friendly and cooperative
relations have achieved sound development. Leaders of the two
countries have had a exchange of visits over the years, and
bilateral exchange and cooperation have been steadily expanded and
fruitful, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the two countries support each other on regional
and international affairs. China appreciates Western Samoa's
consistent adherence to the "One China" policy and its support for
China on the Taiwan issue at the South Pacific Forum, he said.
</P>
<P>
Malielegaoi said that he was deeply impressed with China's
economic development during each of his previous four visits to
China. He said that his visit is a success because it helps to
deepen understanding, expand cooperation, and explore new ways of
promoting bilateral relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Western Samoan government wishes to join efforts with China
to maintain the momentum of the bilateral relations, he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Nevertheless, he noted, China still faces many challenges in
the fight against drug-related offenses. They are:
</P>
<P>
-- the invasion of international drug dealers. Total volume of
the worldwide narcotics trade hits more than 500 billion US
dollars a year, accounting for 13 percent of the total size of the
overall world trade volume.
</P>
<P>
The huge benefits and immense consumption market have
stimulated the growth of drug production and trafficking. This has
had an unavoidable influence on China, as the country borders the
world's biggest drug producer to its southwest -- the "golden
triangle" of Myanmar, Thailand and Laos -- which churns out 2,500 to
3,000 tons of opium a year;
</P>
<P>
-- increasing amounts of drug trafficking. Drug trafficking
along the Sino-Myanmar border was reduced for several years as a
result of continued crackdowns, but drug dealers became more
active last year, according to Tao.
</P>
<P>
-- drug addicts are becoming more prevalent. According to the
official figure of 1995, the number of addicts registered with the
government institutions reached 520,000. And today, around 60 to
70 percent of the 5,157 AIDS population in China were initially
infected as a result of drug use.
</P>
<P>
-- more and more drug dealers from overseas are coming to China
to process the country's abundant natural Chinese ephedra into
methamphetamine, or "ice;" and
</P>
<P>
-- practices of opium planting in some places have not been
totally eliminated.
</P>
<P>
As part of the swift and fierce offensives against drug-related
crimes, Tao said a "targeted fight" has been prepared for later
this year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China will continue to enforce its policy of
forced treatment for drug addicts, strengthen crackdowns upon
drug-related crimes and punishment against criminals, improve its
management mechanism on medicines or other materials that could be
used as or to produce drugs, intensify its drug education
campaigns to increase public awareness against the dangers of
narcotics and arouse the public in the fight against drugs,
according to Tao.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 high-ranking anti-drug officials from ministries
and provinces attended the three-day national conference.

BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Bank of China, one of the
country's largest commercial banks, generated 11.6 billion yuan in

replace the existing navigational aids with future air
navigational systems (FANS) to ensure better air traffic safety,
Press Trust of India (PTI) said here today.
</P>
<P>
The DOS has plans to introduce payloads in Indian and other
satellites exclusively for this purpose, which would uplink with
the 24 navar satellites positioned around the globe for the global
positioning system.
</P>
<P>
The DOS plans to play a vital role in establishing the
satellite navigation infrastructure to meet national needs
dovetailing into global navigational satellite system.
</P>
<P>
Satellite navigation is expected to replace the inertial
navigation systems in aircraft in advanced countries in the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
The areas DOS has identified for undertaking projects include
signal generation and uplink from navigation land earth station in
the country to two geostationary navar satellites.

<P>
ALMA ATA, March 25 (Xinhua) - Kazakhstan's top security
official today urged Russia and NATO to make concessions over the
military alliance's planned eastward expansion to avoid the
emergence of a "new cold war boundary and a new military bloc."
</P>
<P>
The Secretary of the Kazakh Security Council Beksultan Sarsekov
said NATO expansion, which Russia strongly opposes, is
irreversible. But it must take Russian interests into account.
</P>
<P>
Sarsekov also hoped the United States and Russia could reach a
compromise on NATO's eastward expansion before this July.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-Russia Summit in Helsinki last week was positive and
beneficial. It will promote mutual understanding between
Russia and NATO and benefit European peace and security, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Kazakh military reforms, Sarsekov said the
country's armed forces are defensive and the aim of the reforms is
to improve efficiency.

<HEADLINE> HK's ECIC Records 14 Percent Business Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Export Credit
Insurance Corporation (ECIC) announced today a double-digit growth
 in insured business for the financial year ended March 31, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Mr Thomas Yiu, the newly appointed commissioner of ECIC, said
that the growth is likely to reach 14 percent, with total exports
of goods and services insured expected to exceed 20 billion HK
dollars (2.56 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The United States continued to be the largest insured market,
accounting for one-third of the total insured business. The United
 Kingdom and Germany were likely to remain the second and third
largest markets, comprising 17 percent and 11 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
In terms of products insured, textiles and garments formed the
largest group, totaling 5.8 billion HK dollars (747 million US
dollars), or 29 percent, to be followed by toys, and plastic,
metallic and leather goods.
</P>
<P>
However, claims paid out will amount to about 71 million HK
dollars (9.1 million US dollars), rising 57 percent over the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
As to corporate strategy for 1997-1998, ECIC hopes to build on
efforts begun in the past year in such areas as consolidating the
marketing efforts targeted at the various services sectors and
product groups, enhancing the computer system and sustaining the
provision of quality service.
</P>
<P>
Challenges such as developing China's inland areas as a
potential insured market will also be addressed by the corporation
which has 30 years' experience in the export credit field.

<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- China hopes the US will earnestly
abide by and carry out the commitment solemnly made in the three
communiques between China and the US regarding the Taiwan issue, a
spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions on the Sino-US ties at a press
conference, spokesman Cui Tiankai expressed the hope that the
Taiwan issue would not become an obstacle to the improvement and
growth of the Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
With regard to weapons proliferation, what China concerns most
is the large US sales of advanced weapons to Taiwan, the spokesman
said, "and the US side is clear about China's position on this
matter."
</P>
<P>
As for the impact of the human rights issue on the Sino-US
relations, Cui said differences, which include the one on human
rights, result from different situations in the two countries, and
therefore are "natural."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said China believes "it is not hard to solve its
differences with the US through deepening understanding on the
basis of equality and mutual respect."
</P>
<P>
Cui described the US attitude as "positive and constructive,"
which was demonstrated in Vice-President Al Gore's statement when
he arrived here Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
Gore cited an ancient Chinese poem as saying that China and the
US should "scale a greater height" in order to seek more common
interests.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's insurance industry
recorded double digit growth of 12 percent in 1995 although at a
slower pace than the previous year, an official release said
today.
</P>
<P>
The release said total gross premiums in respect of general
business and long term business in 1995 amounted to 43.8 billion
HK dollars (5.62 billion US dollars), representing some four
percent of Hong Kong's gross domestic product for that year.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the industry said the growth was contributed
mainly by the growth in long term business.
</P>
<P>
Property damage business continued to be the largest
contributor to general business gross premiums, accounting for
about 30 percent of the total. This was followed by general
liability business with a market share of 20 percent, and motor
vehicle business with a market share of 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
The relatively substantial growth of long term business was
mainly the result of the continuous expansion in individual life
business.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are 221 authorized insurers operating in Hong
Kong.

<HEADLINE> Several Issues on Existing Laws to Be Adopted as Laws of HKSAR (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- An signed article released by
Xinhua today expounds on several issues concerning the laws
previously in force in Hong Kong which are to be adopted as laws
of the future Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
It first quoted Article 160 of the Basic Law of the HKSAR,
saying: "Upon the establishment of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, the laws previously in force in Hong Kong
shall be adopted as laws of the region, except for those which the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress declares to
be in contravention of this Law. If any laws are later discovered
to be in contravention of this Law, they shall be amended or cease
to have force in accordance with the procedure as prescribed by
this Law."
</P>
<P>
Based on this, the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong SAR
of the NPC examined the existing laws on Hong Kong and put forward
suggestions on how to handle them. On February 23, the 24th
Session of the Standing Committee of the NPC made a decision on
this issue.
</P>
<P>
The article explained the following four aspects of this issue:
</P>
<P>
First, the NPC Standing Committee declared that very few laws
previously in force in Hong Kong go against the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The laws previously in force in Hong Kong include the common
law, rules of equity, ordinances, subordinate legislation and
customary law. The Preparatory Committee has placed emphasis on
examining the ordinances and subordinate legislation.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong now has a total of more than 640 chapters in
ordinances and more than 1,160 items of subordinate legislation.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee has decided not to adopt as laws of
the Hong Kong SAR a total of only 24 items, including 14 entire
ordinances and subordinate legislation and 10 items of partial
articles of ordinances and subordinate legislation. These items
account for 1.3 percent of the total number of the ordinances and
subordinate legislation previously in force in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
This means that most of the existing laws in Hong Kong can be
adopted as laws of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Doing this also demonstrates the principle of basically not
changing the laws previously in force in Hong Kong and reflects
the actual need to make essential changes to the existing laws
after Hong Kong becomes a local administrative region of
China. And it conforms to the stipulations on basically not
changing the existing laws as prescribed in the Sino-British Joint
Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong and the Basic Law.

<HEADLINE> Several Issues on Existing Laws to Be Adopted as Laws of HKSAR (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Second, the aboved-mentioned 24 items of law are in
contravention of the Basic Law, so they cannot be adopted as laws
of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
These laws which are in contravention of the Basic Law can be
divided into four categories:
</P>
<P>
-- A small number of ordinances and subordinate legislation
contravene the Basic Law in their entirety; these mainly include
laws reflecting the British colonial rule over Hong Kong and laws
formulated by the British Hong Kong government according to the
Constitutional Bill, which violates the Sino-British Joint
Declaration, as well as the principles in line with the Basic Law
and the understanding and agreements signed between the Chinese
and British governments;
</P>
<P>
-- Partial clauses and articles of ordinances and subordinate
legislature contravene the Basic Law;
</P>
<P>
-- There are some terms and phrases in almost every ordinance
and subordinate legislation which contravene the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Suggestions have been made that those terms and phrases which
are used not in a proper way, but are correct in content, can be
adopted as laws of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it is imperative to stipulate corresponding
principles to replace these terms and phrases in line with the
Basic Law. For example, any government or semi-official
organizations using the word "Royal" in their name should
eliminate the word "Royal" from the name, and then be described as
corresponding organizations of the government of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
-- The British Hong Kong government unilaterally formulated the
Hong Kong Bill of Rights during the transitional period of Hong
Kong. Some special articles and clauses stipulate that the Hong
Kong Bill of Rights has the power to override other laws in Hong
Kong. As a result, the Basic Law will be built on a weak
foundation.
</P>
<P>
These articles and clauses which include the stipulation on
interpreting and applying this ordinance in Clause 3 of Section 2
of Chapter 383, the stipulation regarding the effect on
pre-existing legislation in Section 3, and the stipulation
concerning interpretation of subsequent legislation in Section 4,
cannot be adopted as laws of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
The article noted that the Hong Kong Bill of Rights will be
adopted as laws of the Hong Kong SAR, with the exception of the
above-mentioned clause and sections.
</P>
<P>
This decision will not affect the Hong Kong residents' rights
and freedoms prescribed by the Hong Kong Bill of Rights.

<HEADLINE> Several Issues on Existing Laws to Be Adopted as Laws of HKSAR(3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thirdly, the British side had explicitly said that the existing
laws in Hong Kong were in complete compliance with the
international covenants on human rights.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the UN Commission on Human Rights in 1978,
Britain said clearly that the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights was of no legal validity in Hong Kong, and the
obligations set out in the covenant were fulfilled through
different sorts of clauses in various legal systems.
</P>
<P>
These clauses were not formulated for the purpose of fulfiling
the covenant, but they are in complete accordance with it, the
report says.
</P>
<P>
During the negotiations on the Hong Kong issue between China
and Britain, the British side said that there was no need to
formulate a special bill of rights, because the two international
covenants on human rights were both fulfilled through the common
law, the existing ordinances and administrative measures, either
in Britain or in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
It also repeatedly claimed that the Hong Kong laws entirely
conform to the covenants.
</P>
<P>
Until 1989, Britain said in a report to the Commission on Human
Rights, that the measures governing procession and assembly in the
Public Order Ordinance and the power of the police in the Police
Force Ordinance were all appropriate.
</P>
<P>
However in 1991, the British side formulated the Hong Kong Bill
of Rights Ordinance, and made a series of significant changes to
the existing laws in Hong Kong according to it, despite opposition
from the Chinese side.
</P>
<P>
None of those laws, revised or abolished by the British Hong
Kong government, contravened the Basic Law, and the British side
in the past claimed that they conformed to the international
covenants on human rights.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-British Joint Declaration has demonstrated in some
provisions that it is the common obligation of both the
governments of China and Britain to retain the existing laws in
Hong Kong basically unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Based on these provisions, the Basic Law prescribed in Article
8 that the existing laws in Hong Kong "shall be maintained, except
for any that contravene this law, and subject to any amendment by
the legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region."
</P>
<P>
The amendments made by the British side go entirely against the
Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. ( More)

<HEADLINE> Hungary Hails Result of Helsinki Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Hungarian Foreign Ministry
said today last week's U.S.-Russian summit in Helsinki gave
grounds for cautious optimism.
</P>
<P>
During the summit between Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris
Yeltsin, Russia accepted NATO's eastward expansion in principle
and the talks helped continue, expand and deepen the dialogue
between NATO and Russia, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Gabor
Szentivanyi told the press.
</P>
<P>
Hungary hopes to be one of the first wave of former Warsaw Pact
countries in eastern Europe to be invited to join the NATO
military alliance.
</P>
<P>
Poland and the Czech Republic are also widely expected to be
offered membership when NATO leaders meet in Madrid in July to
decide which countries to allow to join the bloc.

<TEXT>
<P>
Finally, the amendments of the Society Ordinance and the Public
Order Ordinance made by the British Hong Kong government
unilaterally contravene the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
As the Society Ordinance and the Public Order Ordinance do not
contravene the Basic Law and the international covenants on human
rights, it is unnecessary to make any amendments to them. Even if
necessary, they should be done by the Hong Kong SAR legislature.
</P>
<P>
According to the Bill of Rights Ordinance, the amendments of
the Society Ordinance are mainly: to change the way of registering
a social organization, which will be to inform the relevant
department instead of asking for approval; to abolish restrictions
on the local social organizations to make contacts with overseas
political organizations and also on the establishment of the
political organizations at school; and to abolish much of the
administrative power of the government departments to be in charge
of social organizations.
</P>
<P>
The amendments of the Public Order Ordinance mainly include: to
change the application of assembly, which will be to inform the
relevant departments instead of asking for approval; and to set
restrictions on the power of the police to be in charge of the
procession.
</P>
<P>
It is a misunderstanding that assembly and procession will be
banned if the revised Public Order Ordinance is not adopted,
because the Basic Law grants Hong Kong residents broader and more
concrete rights and freedom than the international covenants on
human rights.
</P>
<P>
As prescribed in Article 27 of the Basic Law, "Hong Kong
residents shall have freedom of speech, of the press and of
publication; freedom of association, of assembly, of procession
and of demonstration; and the right and freedom to form and join
trade unions, and to strike."
</P>
<P>
The original Public Order Ordinance gives the government
departments more power to administer assembly and procession,
which is helpful in maintaining the transportation order and in
guaranteeing the local residents right to live in peace and
contentment.
</P>
<P>
The article points out that there are no absolute rights and
freedoms without limits in the world. The International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights, on one hand, grants the people
equality in the eyes of the law, the freedom of religious belief,
and freedom and right of expression and assembly.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, it sets out some restrictions in some
provisions. For instance, Article 19 stipulates that everyone
enjoys the freedom of expression, but must respect the rights and
reputation of others, and guarantee the state security and public
order.
</P>
<P>
Any country sets rules for procession and assembly and
restricts rights and freedom of the minority of the people, in
order to guarantee more rights and freedom for the majority.
</P>
<P>
To maintain a stable society requires a sort of balance for any
place, it says. How to establish such a balance should be left for
the future Hong Kong SAR government to decide on its own.

to the problem.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin met
with a delegation from the Austrian National Council led by its
president Heinz Fischer here today, saying that China will join
efforts with Austria to develop a long-term, stable bilateral
relationship facing the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China and Austria are two friendly nations
without any direct conflicts of interest but strong economic
complementarity. The two countries have broad prospects of
developing long-term and stable friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the past few years, friendly cooperation
between the two countries has been continuously expanding and that
leaders of the two sides have kept constant contacts with each
other. This has created favorable conditions for the overall
development of bilateral relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that further enhancement of Sino-Austrian cooperation
in all fields will be in the interest of not only the two peoples,
but also peace and stability in the world.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that disputes between countries can be solved and
bilateral relations be improved through friendly negotiation on
the basis of good will and seeking common ground and putting aside
differences. The exchange of visits and friendly dialogues can
deepen understanding, expand common ground and diminish
differences even though some problems cannot be solved overnight,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Calling Fischer "an old friend of the Chinese people," Jiang
said that Fischer's visit will have a positive effect on the
all-round development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said that exchange and cooperation between the two
countries in economic, cultural, and other fields have been
growing smoothly. Austria wishes to continue the exchange and
cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Fischer conveyed Austrian President Thomas
Klestil's good wishes to Jiang. Jiang asked Fischer to convey his
regards to Klestil.

Standing Committee Chen Muhua attended the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Bank of China Backs HK Financial Budget for 1997-98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong-based Bank of
China has expressed its support for the territory's proposed
financial budget for 1997-98, according to an economic journal
issued by the Bank of China Hong Kong Macao Regional Office.
</P>
<P>
An article of the journal said that the budget was
"appropriate" and it praised the budget's cautious spending,
especially in a year with a huge surplus and reserves.
</P>
<P>
It said the budget was set to maintain financial and social
stability before and after Hong Kong's return to the motherland,
while maintaining ample reserves for the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) government.
</P>
<P>
It said that next year's budget could show a 2.56 billion HK
dollars deficit if there was a change in the way revenue from the
sale of government-owned quarters was treated.
</P>
<P>
It welcomed the decision to spend significant amounts in the
budget on education, housing and social welfare.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that having ample reserves would strengthen the
HKSAR's ability to support the Hong Kong dollar and certain
speculation in the event attacks on the currency.
</P>
<P>
It said that the reserves would also make it easier for the
HKSAR government to balance future budgets, while confronting any
financial difficulty that might occur.

<P>
CAIRO, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from middle east countries:
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkish Central Bank Governor Gazi Ercel has said
that Turkey would try to reduce its high inflation in effort to
speed up its integration with Europe, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a Central Bank-sponsored seminar called "Turkey's
Europeanization Problem in the EU Process" here on Monday, Ercel
said that Turkey should be becoming "Western" before fully
involving itself in the EU, adding this approach was in line with
Turkey's national interests.
</P>
<P>
He explained that to achieve and sustain macroeconomic
stability, Turkey had to take concrete and effective measures to
make its inflation go down to a single digit.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank chief called for a political support for a
medium-term economic stability program needed to reshape Turkey's
role in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"We are having currently an exchange of views on this with
concerned departments, and whether this program could be launched
soon entirely depends on whether a political support is available,"
Ercel said.
</P>
<P>
He said the annual inflation rate would be 70 percent by June.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey's large-scale drinking water project bidding
has to be extended until March 31 due to unexpected lack of
interest of the tenderers.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Daily News today reported that the Manavgat
project near the Mediterranean Sea, which is designed to have a
daily capacity of producing 500,000 cubic meters of water, has
drawn little interest from potential companies.
</P>
<P>
The Manavgat project, which is estimated to cost a total
of 100 million U.S. dollars, was opened to bidding in January
with a deadline of February 14.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's State Water Authority was disappointedly surprised at
the fact that few companies showed interest for this project.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that companies which wish to participate in
the bidding must have a branch operating in the international
market with an annual turnover of at least 10 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The project, which aims to provide drinking water to those
water-deficient countries, will produce an annual turnover of
80-100 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Egyptian government has mapped out a strategy on
increasing the economic growth rate to 7.8 percent by 2000 from
the current 4 to 5 percent, said Minister of Economy and
International Cooperation Nawal al-Tatawi.
</P>
<P>
Investment growth rates will also rise by 25 percent instead of
the current 17 percent by the end of the century, Tatawi told the
first session of the fifth conference of Egyptian Expatriate
Businessmen held under the title "Privatization and the Money
Market."
</P>
<P>
Tatawi said the government is keen on encouraging the private
sector to contribute to developing financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the Egyptian capital market has risen to
international levels in 1996, Tatawi said the volume of
circulation has soared to 11 billion Egyptian pounds (3.24 billion
U.S. dollars) from 8 billion pounds (2.35 billion dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egypt's investor-friendly legislations have yielded
the establishment of 2,400 new companies, said the minister.

<HEADLINE> HK To Extend Sex Education to Kindergarten Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Sex education will be extended
to kindergartens and primary schools under proposals in the draft
revised Guidelines on Sex Education in Schools (1997) to be issued
 by the Education Department next month.
</P>
<P>
Julian Leung, assistant director of the Education Department,
said that revisions to the former guidelines are necessary in view
 of the rapid social changes over the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
A working group comprising academics, school heads, teachers
and Education Department officers was formed in early 1996 to
compile the revised guidelines.
</P>
<P>
Leung said that the draft revised guidelines aim at helping
teachers to equip students at all levels, starting from
pre-primary level, with the attitudes, values and knowledge
necessary for resolving sex tensions, communicating, building
relationships, self-esteem and concept, and for making decisions
based on informed choices.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Self-reflection, exploration and clarification of
values are given due weight."
</P>
<P>
The draft revised guidelines also define the roles of
principals, teachers, parents, school social workers, students and
 voluntary agencies in sex education.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is recommended that schools should support a
sex education committee or coordinator to support, promote and
coordinate various activities and make liaison with other
committees such as those on civic education and health education.

<HEADLINE> PNG Parliament Rejects Motion Calling on PM to Step </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Papua New Guinea (PNG)
parliament today voted 58-39 against a motion calling on Prime
Minister Julius Chan to step down for hiring mercenaries.
</P>
<P>
During a four and half hour debate this afternoon, Julius told
parliament that the deal to hire mercenaries was of great benefit
to the country's military, the Australian Associated Press
reported from Port Moresby.
</P>
<P>
He said that for the first time the defense forces would have
had up-to-the-minute equipment and training.
</P>
<P>
He also defended the expenditure, which was reported earlier as
48 million Australian dollars (37.5 million US dollars), saying it
had come from a better than expected budget result in the past
year.
</P>
<P>
While parliament agreed to a commission of inquiry
investigating the government's deal to hire mercenaries, Julius
also said he would appear before the commission.
</P>
<P>
Within minutes of the announcement that MPs had voted to reject
the motion and keep Prime Minister and his deputy Chris Haiveta
and Defense Minister Mathias Ijape in office, violence occurred
outside the parliament house.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that a crowd of more than 1,000 blocked the
gates of the parliament building and others stoned cars at a back
entrance.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, US Vice-Presidents Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Rong Yiren
said here today that the common interests between China and the
United States far exceed their differences and that the two
countries should establish healthy and stable relations with an
eye to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting US Vice-President Al Gore, Rong said
Gore has come "at an important moment of the Sino-US relations."
</P>
<P>
Rong thanked Gore for going to the Chinese embassy in the US to
extend condolences on the death of Deng Xiaoping recently.
</P>
<P>
Rong commented that Deng had made "major, historic"
contributions to the development of Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Chinese side is ready to work with the US
side to further advance bilateral relations in commemorating Deng,
a great figure.
</P>
<P>
Gore told Rong that he had looked forward to a meeting with
Rong, who has played a big role in implementing the opening policy
and bringing foreign investment into China.
</P>
<P>
Gore said the US firmly supports China's entry into the World
Trade Organization, adding that China's joining the WTO is in the
interests of China, the US and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
According to Gore, President Jiang Zemin and President Bill
Clinton expressed hope when they met in Manila last November that
the issue (of China's entering the WTO) will be resolved by the
time they have exchanged visits.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that this goal can be achieved as long
as the two sides can reach an agreement of commercial significance.
</P>
<P>
Gore is currently on an official visit to China as a guest of
Chinese Premier Li Peng.

BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Developing Sino-US relations not
only conforms to the interests of both countries, but is conducive
to world peace and stability, Chi Haotian, vice-chairman of the
Central Military Commission and defense minister, said here today.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with a US scholars delegation led by former US
Assistant Secretary of Defense Joseph S. Nye, he said the further
improvement and advancement of bilateral ties represent a general
trend and there is no reason whatsoever to go in for

</P>
<P>
In developing Sino-US relations, attention should also be paid
to removing interferences, in order to avoid ups and downs, said
Chi, also a state councillor.
</P>
<P>
Nye said he was optimistic about the long-term development of
bilateral relations, because the two countries have many

<HEADLINE> Macao Newspapers Hail 1,000-Day Countdown for Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Leading newspapers in Macao today
hailed the 1,000-day countdown for Macao's return to China, which
is observed today, saying it is a "day filled with exultation."
</P>
<P>
"The return of Hong Kong in less than 100 days and Macao in
1,000 days will be days of glory for the two regions," said a
commentary in today's "Macao Daily News." "They will be the
milestones in the reunification of China, and fruit of Deng
Xiaoping's great concept of 'one country, two systems.'"
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that after China resumes its exercise of
sovereignty over Macao, there will be no land in Asia governed by
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
"The return of Macao has a long-lasting significance, which is
well beyond Macao itself, and beyond the relations between China
and Portugal," it said.
</P>
<P>
China and Portugal signed the "Joint Declaration on the
Question of Macao" on April 13, 1987. The joint declaration
subsequently became a guideline for the transition of Macao before
 December 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
As the time draws near the 10th anniversary of the signing of
the joint declaration, the commentary said, much efforts are yet
to be made on the three leading issues of Macao's transition --
the localization of civil service and law and the implementation
of the use of Chinese as an official language.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the commentary stressed, the promotion of the
basic law of Macao, which will serve as a mini-constitution for
Macao after 1999, should continue so that every residents in Macao
 will be familiar with the law.
</P>
<P>
It urged all residents of Macao to work hard to help expand
Macao's economy, and create a social environment conducive to a
stable transition and a smooth transfer of power in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the "Va Kio" newspaper said in a commentary that
the return of Macao in 1,000 days means a "reunion after
over-400-year separation," an "end of foreigners' ruling," a
"beginning of Macao people governing Macao" and a "resumption of
national dignity."
</P>
<P>
In addition, the 1,000-day countdown means an urgency,
"demanding us to quicken the process of transition and make the
transition a success."
</P>
<P>
"Although the task remains arduous in the coming 1,000 days,
Macao residents should be confident in their future," said the
commentary. "Macao will see a stable transition, and will have a
bright future in 1,000 days."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Defense Minister Confers with Portuguese Counterpart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Chi Haotian, vice-chairman of
China's Central Military Commission and defense minister,
conferred with his Portuguese counterpart Antonio Vitorino here
today.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also a state councillor, exchanged views with Antonio
Vitorino on the growth of bilateral relations and particularly on
the exchanges between the two armed forces as well as on other
issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Chi briefed Vitorino on China's views on the situation in the
Asia-Pacific region and in the world as a whole and the country's
diplomatic and national defence policies.
</P>
<P>
China's defense policy is entirely defensive, he said, adding
that there are a handful of people internationally who have kept
spreading the theory of "China Threat" with an ulterior motive to
drive a wedge between China and its neighboring countries,
undermine China's image and contain the country's development.
</P>
<P>
As is known to all that China has neither invaded any other
countries nor sent a single soldier to station abroad, he noted.
Moreover, he added, China will never take the road of expansion
and aggression in the years ahead and this has already been
written into the Chinese constitution.
</P>
<P>
Chi expressed his satisfaction with the growth of bilateral
relations and the hope that bilateral cooperation, including sound
cooperation on the Macao issue, will continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
Vitorino said the two countries have shared an extensive,
common understanding of maintaining world peace and stability, and
that his country holds that the world has been moving towards
multipolarization after the end of the Cold War, and so peace and
stability worldwide not only require the United Nations to play
its role, but also need cooperation among all governments.
</P>
<P>
Portugal highly appreciates China's major contributions to
safeguarding regional peace and world peace at large and it was
pleased to see Chinese leaders follow the country's reform and
opening-up policy set forth by Deng Xiaoping, Vitorino said.
</P>
<P>
Among those present at the talks were Xiong Guangkai, deputy
chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation
Army, and Portugal's Ambassador Jose Manuel Duarte de Jesus.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the talks, Chi presided over a ceremony in honor of
Vitorino, who arrived here Monday for an official visit to China
as his guest.

<HEADLINE> 10 PKK Rebels Killed in Southeastern Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Ten rebels of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) were killed in operations by the
Turkish security forces in southeastern Turkey, an official
statement said today.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued by the office of the Emergency Regional
Rule said that the government troops launched armed attacks
against a group of PKK militants in the areas of Kilibogan and

<HEADLINE> Sports Feature: Olympians Make Clean Sweep of Top Ten (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- You simply couldn't have
expected bumping into so many sports superstars on one night.
</P>
<P>
Yet sports fans throughout the country somewhat managed to
make it happen, if only in an indirect way, by voting their
version of best athletes in the year of 1996.
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, the Chinese Capital Beijing hosted an annual
sports extravaganza of its own, to pay tribute to last year's
outstanding performances in the sporting fields.
</P>
<P>
A space of seven months didn't seem to water down the magic of
Olympic moments. "The Chinese Top Ten Athletes in 1996" has a
full Olympian presence, with ten out of ten basking in last
summer's Olympic triumph.
</P>
<P>
In what might be called the Olympians' night, diving prodigy
Fu Mingxia stole the show from the table tennis phenomenon Deng
Yaping to top the Chinese "Top 10" voting with a virtually
perfect record.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old national sweetheart pulled off a voting
ballots of 261,242, narrowly beating Deng's 260,306 into the
second. The nationwide voting, the 18th edition of its own, has
been echoed by more than 260,000 sports fans around the country.
</P>
<P>
"It is my first time to be selected into the best ten
athletes, and it absolutely thrilled me," said Fu with a toothy
smile.
</P>
<P>
Fu, once the TIME magazine cover figure in 1992, completed the
Mission Impossible at Atlanta by sweeping all of the two women's
diving golds, the first ever diver to do so in 36 years.
</P>
<P>
But Deng's feat haven't at all been shadowed. Having
successfully defended her singles and doubles titles at Atlanta,
the 24-year-old has qualified herself as one of the all-time
greats in Chinese sports history. The girl from the central
China Henan province has now notched up six "Top Ten" trophies,
an equal record shared only by current Chinese national women's
volleyball coach Lang Ping.
</P>
<P>
Yet the veteran wouldn't take it for granted, "Every time I
came here for the Top Ten trophy," Deng said, "I asked myself if
I could repeat it next year."
</P>
<P>
History could repeat itself one more time, if Deng, still the
one with a mission, could remain her typical tigerish style.
"Surely I'll fight on, in this year's Manchester World
Championships and in the National Games also," she confirmed.
</P>
<P>
The athlete who is trying to beat Deng's Top Ten record is Li
Xiaoshuang, the first Chinese male gymnast to clinch the
gymnastics' ultimate honour -- Olympic all-around title.
</P>
<P>
Confined to the wheelchair due to an injury sustained in the
training last month but still managing to take part in the sports
gala, the five-time Top Ten athlete wouldn't wait any longer to
be back to action.
</P>
<P>
"It's really an ill-time injury," Li complained.

<P>
The long-distance runner Wang Junxia, the fifth-placer in the
votings, is also in the recovery state. The 1993 World Athletic
Championship sensation still feels that her bold move of running
30,000 meters in a short space of eight days at Atlanta was
worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
"No other top runners in the entire world would have risked
it," the 1993 Jessy Owens Award owner said, "The gold for the
5,000 meters was a sure thing, yet the 10,000-meter silver was a
windfall blown onto my way. I had thought I couldn't get into
the last eight."
</P>
<P>
Another Top Ten athlete didn't seem that lucky. Compared to
Wang's triumph at her first Olympic attempt, springboard diver
Xiong Ni needed to wait eight years to be standing at top of the
world.
</P>
<P>
However, the narrow loss to Greg Louganis in 1988 Seoul
Olympics and the consolation bronze medal at Barcelona in 1992
only made him a stronger man, Xiong concluded.
</P>
<P>
"All the things I went through in those eight years just
flashed across my mind," the current senior college student
recalled the glorious moment in his third Olympics, "But I
somehow managed not to cry."
</P>
<P>
The entry of the table tennis Olympic titlist Liu Guoliang,
who obtained the same amount of glory as Deng Yaping, only in
men's category, boosted table tennis, an nearly national
institution, to the most elected sports event through the
voting's history, with 14 paddlers being picked up for 26 times.
</P>
<P>
That certainly doesn't mean the contest give a cold shoulder
to less popular sports. Weightlifting world record holder in
men's 70-kg category Zhan Xugang, Judoka Sun Fuming, who won the
first gold medal for China at Atlanta and woman sharpshooter Li
Duihong, winner of the 25m pistol, all came to the party as the
Top Ten newcomers.
</P>
<P>
But Le Jingyi, Olympic champion of the women's 100m freestyle,
is for sure a household name.
</P>
<P>
"Four years later, in Sydney of 2000, you'll see a bunch of
young swimmers in full blossom," Le told reporters.

<HEADLINE> China, US Sign $1.5 Billion Car Joint Venture Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai Automotive Industry
Corporation (SAIC) and the US-based General Motors Corporation
(GM) today signed a contract here to form the Shanghai GM
Co. (SGM), the largest Sino-US joint venture thus far, estimated
to cost 1.57 billion US dollars, in which each party holds half
the stake.
</P>
<P>
John F. Smith, Chairman, President and CEO of GM told the press
that "the United States and Chinese governments have played an
instrumental role in (the establishment of) the joint venture. And
the venture will support the US jobs (market) by generating almost
1.6 billion US dollars in exports for the United States over the
next five years."
</P>
<P>
Located in the Pudong New Area of Shanghai, SGM is to
manufacture '97 Buick sedans, a mid-luxury model, with an eventual
production capacity of 100,000 units. The initial local content
ratio is to reach 40 percent, and will be gradually increased. The
prime target customers are public and corporate users in China.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xianglin, president of SAIC, predicted that the market
demand of deluxe sedans in the year 2000 could hit 120,000 units,
10 percent of the country's car production at that
time. Capacities of Audi and Little Red Flag models, products of
China First Auto Works Corporation, another key local auto maker,
then will reach 30,000 units each.
</P>
<P>
"We plan to meet the remaining market demand after the
first-phase construction which will enable us to turn out 50,000
units, of which six percent are for export," Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
Also signed today was the contract for the creation of Pan Asia
Technical Automotive Center, the first Sino-foreign joint venture
auto development center. According to agreement, the new model
to be produced in the joint venture will be designed by the center.
</P>
<P>
The project is GM's hard-earned result after three years of
"tough competition," according to Smith. Early in 1995, GM and
SAIC signed a basic agreement in Detroit, Michigan.
</P>
<P>
The two sides registered the project in China on September 23,
1996, and China's State Council, or the cabinet, gave the
greenlight in January of this year.
</P>
<P>
Smith cited figures from overseas analysts that even though
China's annual auto production is currently around only 1.5
million units, the figure may hit 2.2 million in 2000, and 3.2
million in 2005.
</P>
<P>
The venture for GM not only provides access to the Chinese
market, but also constitutes part of GM's global network, Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
SAIC plans to take advantage of the opportunity to reach its
goals set for the year 2000. The target of the corporation then is
to register a revenue of 100 billion yuan with a profit of 50
billion yuan, "thus entering into the world's top 500 industrial
corporations," Chen says.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai-Volkswagen Automobile Co., a joint venture clinched
between SAIC and German Volkswagen AG, is now China's largest
passenger car manufacturer. The venture last year turned out
200,000 cars, or 52 percent of China's total.
</P>
<P>
According to sources, SGM then will have an assembly plant, a
stamping plant, a V6 engine plant, an automatic transmission
plant, and relevant marketing and distribution operations.

<HEADLINE> Agriculture Becomes Top Contributor to Nigerian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Agriculture had a tremedous impact on
Nigeria's gross domestic product (GDP) last year with a share of 35.45
percent, a rise of 3.8 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The sector, comprising agricultural crops, livestock, forestry and
fishing, is followed closely by the petroleum and gas sector which
contributed 34.19 percent, according to the latest data of the Federal
Office of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The share of wholesale and retail trade stood at 15.27 percent
while that of manufacturing and other sectors came to 5.8 and 9.29
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's GDP per capita last year increased to
23,491.91 naira (about 294 U.S. dollars) from 20,166.81 naira (about
252 dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
GDP measures the total final output of a nation's economy, which
represents all goods produced and services rendered within a country
by residents and non residents.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural development has been neglected in Nigeria since its
oil boom in the 1970s, resulting in an over-dependence on oil income.
</P>
<P>
Aware of the danger the over-dependence will bring to the national
economy, the Nigerian government has in recent years adopted policies
to encourage the development of the non-oil sector, including
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
To ensure sustainable economic growth and development, the country
has decided to invest more in agriculture this year to promote food
self-sufficiency and increase the income of farmers.
</P>
<P>
In this 1997 budget speech earlier this year, Head of State General
Sani Abacha promised that the government would work out more effective
and efficient mechanism to develop the rural areas, where 70 percent
of Nigerians live.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng and
visiting US Vice-President Al Gore, who is on his first trip to
China, held talks in the Great Hall of the People here this
morning.
</P>
<P>
Li first welcomed Gore on his first visit to the country.
</P>
<P>
"The Vice-President and I held talks in Copenhagen two years
ago, and I am very happy to meet the Vice-President here today in
Beijing," said the Chinese premier.
</P>
<P>
"Though the Sino-US relationship has witnessed some ups and
downs over the past two years, on the whole, it has been moving
forward," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier went on to say that China values Gore's
visit and hopes to advance improvement and development of the
Sino-US relations through the American Vice-President's trip.
</P>
<P>
Li emphasized that President Jiang Zemin's scheduled state
visit to the United States later this year and President Bill
Clinton's return visit to China next year are important events in
the history of Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier heralded Gore's visit to China as an
important step in preparation for the coming exchange of visits
for heads of state of both countries.
</P>
<P>
As the 21st century draws nearer, more and more people with
insight have come to better understand the significance of Sino-US
relations, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"The Sino-US relationship in the 21st century will have a
profound impact not only on the people of the United States and
China, but also for the world pattern of the next century," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that the two countries maintaining and
developing a healthy, stable relationship is in keeping with the
fundamental good of the two countries and their people, and is
also conducive to the stability and prosperity of the world and
the Asian-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that the importance of the Sino-US
relationship will be fully reflected in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Li told Gore that China is willing to make concerted efforts
together with the United States, seize the current favorable
opportunities, strengthen dialogue, advance cooperation,
appropriately deal with problems and differences existing in the
two countries' relations, and promote the development of these
relations on the basis of the three Sino-US joint communiques.
</P>
<P>
While emphasizing that the issue of Taiwan has always been the
most important and touchiest central problem facing Sino-US
relations, Li said that China is appreciative of US government
leaders' promise to continue to pursue the "one China" policy and
their commitment to abide by the three Sino-US joint communiques,
which he hopes the United States will carry out in earnest.

<TEXT>
<P>
Gore said that he has long been expecting to visit
China. Before this trip, he read a number of books on Chinese
history and culture to improve his understanding of the country.
</P>
<P>
Gore quoted an old Chinese saying to express his willingness to
learn about China's ancient civilization and modernization through
his current visit: "It is better to see once than to hear a
hundred times."
</P>
<P>
Gore said that the US government has always placed great
importance on US-Chinese relations, and the US government wishes
to see China playing an increasingly more important role in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president said the United States believes that whether
or not the two sides can deal with bilateral relations in a
beneficial way, and how the two countries play their roles in the
world will have a tremendous influence over world peace and
prosperity in the 21st century. The United States wishes to
enhance cooperation with China and marches together towards a
peaceful and prosperous 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Gore said that policies mapped out by the US government toward
China were based on this kind of long term-thinking as well as the
strategic interests of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The US government will unswervingly follow these policies and
this will not be interrupted by individual events at any time,
Gore said, adding that his visit to China is the best
demonstration of this pledge.
</P>
<P>
He said that President Clinton is looking forward to Chinese
President Jiang Zemin's visit to the United States and to paying a
return visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Gore paid high tribute to distinct achievements China has made
since it started reform and opening up to the outside world, and
the praiseworthy improvement in people's standard of living.
</P>
<P>
Gore said that the United States supports China's entry into
the World Trade Organization (WTO), as this is in accordance with
the interests of the United States, China and the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
The United States hopes to solve the issue of China's entry
into the WTO through negotiations as soon as possible under
meaningful business conditions -- meaning conditions that are fair
to both sides, Gore said.
</P>
<P>
Li said that as a big developing trade country, China wishes to
join the WTO and has taken great steps to reach the goal,
including making sharp tariff cuts.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to shoulder its responsibilities as well as
enjoy related rights once it enters the WTO, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li said he is confident that China will maintain its rapid and
healthy economic growth no matter when it joins the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier was optimistic about the future of
bilateral economic and trade ties. He said that as China's economy
continues to grow and its door opens wider to the outside world,
the country has provided the US commodities and capital with a
huge market.
</P>
<P>
The recent improvement of Sino-U.S. relations has injected
vitality into economic and trade cooperation between the two
countries, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Hong Kong, Li said that China will resume the
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Long in less than 100 days. The
return of Hong Kong to the motherland symbolizes that China has
taken an essential step toward its reunification. All of the
Chinese people, including the six million Hong Kong compatriots,
are elated by the good tidings, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's smooth return to the motherland has been decided,"
Li said. "We are confident in Hong Kong's smooth transition as
well as its prosperity and stability. The majority of Hong Kong
compatriots are also confident about Hong Kong's future."
</P>
<P>
Li said that the Chinese government's policy toward Hong Kong,
which is "One country, two systems," "Hong Kong people governing
Hong Kong" and a high-degree of autonomy, is consistent and clear.
</P>
<P>
"The policy will not be changed," the premier reaffirmed.

<P>
MAPUTO, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The recent floods in the northern

hectares of land and seven schools, the Noticias paper reported
today.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed here today by Silvano Langa, director of the

Besides, drought hit Mocimboa da Praia district in Nampula
province, and peasants need seeds there to sow their land, Langa
said, adding 230 tons of food relief would be sent to the two

<HEADLINE> Zambia May Sue Investors Unfulfilling Commitments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will take to court those
investors who fail to fulfill their investment commitments
contained in agreements they signed when buying parastatal
companies.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Mail today quoted Valentine Chitalu, the Chief
Executive of the Zambia Privatization Agency (ZPA), as saying
that the investors are liable to court action if they do not
honor such investment pledges.
</P>
<P>
He said the ZPA can ensure a company undertakes its certain
legally-binding pledges.
</P>
<P>
However, Chitalu said most new owners of privatized firms have
been fulfilling their investment pledges.
</P>
<P>
The ZPA can only monitor commitments relating to investments
because they are unable to continue monitoring other commitments
once new owners take over, he added.
</P>
<P>
Last year the ZPA raised more money from the sale of
state-owned enterprises compared to 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1996 economic report of the Ministry of
Finance, 38.7 billion Kwacha (about 30 million U.S. Dollars) was
realized in 1996 compared with 12.5 billion Kwacha in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Oil Workers Held Hostage in Southwestern Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The security situation worsened on
Monday in Warri, a major oil production base in southwestern
Nigeria's Delta state, as protesting IJaw communities rebuffed
efforts to free the 177 oil workers and traders held hostage.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about nine crude oil flow stations belonging to oil
giants Shell and Chevron have been closed down by the Ijaws, who
began last Saturday their protest against the movement of the
headquarters of the newly-created Warri South local government.
</P>
<P>
The production stations of Shell are located in the Western
Division of its operations in the state, where the company
normally turns out about 450,000 barrels of oil a day.
</P>
<P>
Although oil exports have not been disrupted, Shell has to
suffer a loss of some 100,000 barrels a day while Chevron's loss
is reported to reach about 45,000 barrels daily.
</P>
<P>
The hostages, including 127 Shell workers and 50 traders, are
said to run out of food as the Ijaw communities have been sharing
their limited supplies with them.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports, six of the hostages have been
wounded in an abortive escape attempt.
</P>
<P>
Shell's Head of safety (West) Francis Ifedi was quoted as
saying Monday that "Evacuation of our workers (held hostage) have
been difficult as they are confined within the area. Only one of
our supervisors was allowed to reach them."
</P>
<P>
Oil equipment and boats belonging to Chevron and other oil
services companies have been impounded by the protesters.
</P>
<P>
There are reports of shooting in the affected areas by the
protesters using Dane guns to scare off mediators and by the
armed anti-riot policemen. But the news item is yet to be
confirmed.

<HEADLINE> Gore Visits Chinese High School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- US Vice-President Al Gore visited
an experimental high school associated with Beijing Teacher's
University today and learned about the school's program of "Global
Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment"(GLOBE).
</P>
<P>
The Globe program, initiated by Gore on April 22, 1994, or the
World Earth Day, is an international cooperative project on
environmental education.
</P>
<P>
The experimental high school, together with three other Chinese
schools, joined in the program in 1996 after China and the US
signed a cooperative agreement on the project.
</P>
<P>
At an outdoor observation station of the school, Gore and
several senior students gauged the temperature, the rainfall and
other environmental conditions, then stored the data on a
computer. After processing, the computer presented an image that
showed the students the environmental conditions they live in.
</P>
<P>
After learning that all the students of the class have
participated in the Globe program and collect such information
every day, Gore exclaimed, "Very impressive!"
</P>
<P>
The students presented Gore with a plate bearing a Peking Opera
painted face. Gore accepted the gift with pleasure and told the
students he will put the plate in a place of honor at his official
residence.
</P>
<P>
Invited by the students to write in the school's guest-book,
Gore penned, "Congratulations on your success with the Globe
Program."
</P>
<P>
The Vice-President and his party also toured the Palace Museum
this afternoon.

<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard's upcoming visit to China underlines the importance
the Australian government attaches to the development of its
relations with Asia and particularly with China, Australian
Ambassador to China Richard Campbell Smith said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference on Prime Minister Howard's China trip
later this week, Smith said that Australian attaches very great
importance to its relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Howard has been the first Australian Prime Minister
to visit China since former Prime Minister Paul Keating's visit in
1993, he emphasized that Sino-Australian relations are of great
importance for Australia's interests in foreign affairs and
economic relations and trade.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Howard's entourage includes representatives of
18 leading Australian companies, who will explore new avenues to
bilateral economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Prime Minister Howard is expected to meet

<HEADLINE> Annan to Leave Angola After Meeting Angolan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
is to end his four-day visit to Angola today after meeting with
Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos last night on the lastest
development in the country's peace process.
</P>
<P>
Annan told Dos Santos that Jonas Savimbi, the leader of the
opposition National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA), promised in central Bailundo earlier on Monday that all
UNITA lawmakers will arrive in capital Luanda today.
</P>
<P>
With the arrival of UNITA lawmakers and politicians, things
will be ready for consultation between the Angolan government and
UNITA on the date of the inauguration of the government of
national unity and reconciliation, said Santos.
</P>
<P>
Some certain procedures will be carried out so as to ensure
the UNITA parliamentary members to assume office legally, he
added.
</P>
<P>
However, said Santos, it is not suitable at the time for
himself and Savimbi to meet each other although he has repeated
his invitation to Savimbi times again.
</P>
<P>
His invitation to Savimbi for face-to-face talks is still
effective, Santos said.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who arrived on Saturday, will leave here today for
Togo's capital Lome to attend a summit of the Organization of
African Unity on the Zairean crisis.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Continues Declining in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria now has an inflation rate
of 23 percent, down by five percent from December but six percent
higher than the government's 17 percent projection by the end of
1997, said Finance Minister Chief Anthony Ani.
</P>
<P>
However, hopes are still high as the fall will stimulate
economic growth, raise capacity utilization in industries and
boost purchasing power of Naira, the country's currency, he said
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
It contrasts with continued depreciation of the value of Naira
at the Autonomous Foreign Exchange Market (AFEM) and on the black
market where 85 to 87 Naira now equal to one U.S. Dollar.
</P>
<P>
Press reports today quoted Ani as saying that the fall of the
inflation rate was a result of "prudent" economic policies.
</P>
<P>
These policies include tight fiscal measures to curtail
extra-budgetary spending, the promulgation of the Failed Bank
Decree, the sanitization of the customs, sealing of oil leakages
and harnessing of excess proceeds from sale of petroleum goods.

<P>
ANKARA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Azerbaijani President Geidar
Aliyev will pay a three-day official visit to Turkey starting on
April 8 to enhance the cooperation between the two countries,
local newspaper Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Aliyev is to meet with his Turkish
counterpart Suleyman Demirel, Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan as
well as Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted informed sources as saying that one of the
major topics to be discussed will be the Caspian Sea oil issue.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has put forward a proposal of transporting the Caspian
Sea oil along the planned Baku-Ceyhan (southern Turkey) route to
the world markets but this tentative idea has not been approved
by Azerbaijan so far.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said the proposal which will make considerable
profits for Turkey has already been ignored or even turned down by
Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
A senior Turkish Foreign Ministry official, who asked not to
be named, denied such reports, saying the Azerbaijani side has
expressed support for the construction of the route and the route
would be probably marked in the joint declaration to be signed at
the end of Aliyev's visit.

UNDP and the Zambian government have identified agricultural
development and food security, employment and sustainable
livelihood, good governance, environment and natural resource
management as some of the critical areas to benefit from the
program.

<P>
The focus will be directed at assisting grass-root levels of
society, particularly the vulnerable.

on environment and natural resource management globally, hence
the need to channel funds in this sector.

The report also quoted Zambian Minister of Environment and
Natural Resources William Harrington as disclosing that the
United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) has enlisted Zambia as
a beneficiary for the 75 million U.S. Dollars fund to tackle

intensified surveillance on a controversial AIDS drug imported
from Zambia.
</P>
<P>
"The authority has never been contacted nor authorized the

<HEADLINE> Tanzania, Japan Sign Accord On Rice Supplies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania and Japan have
concluded an agreement under which Japan will extend a grant
worth 500 million Japanese Yen (about 4.16 million U.S. Dollars)
for the rice supply to the eastern African country.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed here on Monday by Peter Ngumbullu,
the Principal Secretary to the Treasury on behalf of the
Tanzanian government and Shintaro Sasaki, Japan's Ambassador to
Tanzania on behalf of the government of Japan.
</P>
<P>
Inking the accord, Sasaki said the consignment will consist of
rice from Japan, Australia, the United States and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
He added that the particular food aid grant is extended to
Tanzania at a time when there is a big demand of food caused by
prolonged drought in the country, as well as the recent influx of
refugees from Burundi and Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"My government has decided to make available this food aid
grant to supplement your government's efforts in support of the
people whose food stocks have been reduced due to the failure of
rain and other reasons," Sasaki said.
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania was endowed with abundant natural resources
including rivers and lakes which could be utilized for irrigation
purposes.
</P>
<P>
The use of modern farming techniques, such as fertilizer,
agro-chemicals and agro-machinery, also has to be intensified if
reliable food supply is to be achieved in Tanzania, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government has been a supplier of food aid to
Tanzania since 1977 with a total of some 63.8 million Dollars
having been extended to Tanzania so far.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Urged to Protect Local Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has been
urged to take measures to limit imports of certain products that
have an excessive market share at the expense of local goods.
</P>
<P>
Chairman Mark O'donnel of the Zambia Association of
Manufacturers (ZAM) said that such measures are used by any
government of a developing country if it believes that serious
damage is being done to the economy by unfair competition.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Mail today quoted him as saying that ''this may
involve imposing quotas on offending products causing the damage
or raising duty levels to a point where those products no longer
enjoy the market access they had in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted him as saying that it is important
for the government to act on his subject without asking the World
Trade Organization (WTO) since such action will be in conformity
with WTO laws.
</P>
<P>
''We can help provide the lists of items that are doing harm
and which require the use of safeguard measures to ensure that
our domestic industry survives,'' said O'donnel.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Wants Peace Agreement Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Yasser Arafat, President of the
Palestinian national authority, said today that he was for peace
everywhere in the world and that he was ready to mediate between
the Sri Lankan government and the Tamil rebels who have been
waging a 14-year-old war for a separate state.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who is currently on an official visit here, said at a
press conference held in Colombo today that all he wanted was for
the agreement signed between him and the late Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin at White House, witnessed by America and
Russia, to be honored.
</P>
<P>
If that was done he was certain that peace could be established
in the Middle East as he and Rabin, who later sacrificed his life,
 had believed.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses to that agreement included the European Union,
Norway, Japan, the United Nations, Egypt and Jordan, he said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was followed by resolutions in the United
Nations, and all those who endorsed those resolutions should push
for their implementation, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the present Israeli policies were an obstruction to
peace in the Middle East. He was surprised at the Israeli decision
to isolate Jerusalem and construct new settlements both inside and
outside it.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the United States for vetoing twice a United
nations Security Council Resolution demanding that Israel halt the
East Jerusalem settlements. This only helped encourage Israel to
pursue its aggression and its challenge to international
legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government should realize that there is no
alternative to peace. Peace was for the courageous and the brave.
</P>
<P>
"Peace is the need of the Palestinians. Peace is the need of
Israel. Peace is the need of the Middle East. Peace is the need of
 everywhere in the world", Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians were facing difficulties now due to the
closure declared by Israel including their airport, as a result of
which they were losing about 9 million US dollars a day, he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Still, he was confident that peace will ultimately triumph.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was thankful to Sri Lanka which had throughout extended
its hand of friendship and support to him personally and to the
people of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said that as a person who had seen both war and peace,
he wished the best for the friendly people of Sri Lanka and was
ready to help them achieve it.

<HEADLINE> EU Team To Inspect Fish Fillet Plant in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A team of experts from the
European Union (EU) is expected to arrive in Tanzania this month
to inspect fish fillet plants in the Lake Victoria Zone, the
local paper Sunday Observer reported today.
</P>
<P>
The reports said some EU members recently imposed a partial
ban on exports of fish fillet from Uganda, as the EU mission had
already inspected 21 fish fillet industries in Uganda,
disqualifying 19 of them from the business.
</P>
<P>
The closure of the 19 fish processing industries in Uganda on
grounds that they were producing fish fillets which were
detrimental to human health had created fear in the EU market,
the reports added.
</P>
<P>
The EU mission would undertake the same task in Kagera, Mara
and Mwanza regions in Tanzania and present its findings to the
relevant authorities.
</P>
<P>
Mwanza municipality has eight fish fillet plants so far.
</P>
<P>
The reports said Spain, Greece and Italy had imposed a ban on
imports of fish fillet from Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The reports said Spain had conducted laboratory examinations
and found that fish fillet produced in Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya
were a health hazard.
</P>
<P>
Following the ban, Tanzania is losing 2,000 million Tanzania
Shillings (about 3.33 million U.S. Dollars) a month from exports
of 1,250 tons of fish fillet.

of the outbreak of the foot and mouth disease there.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Primary Production Department (PPD) said that
only a small quantity of pork was imported from Taiwan as
Singapore's main source of pork supply was Malaysia and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
All pork imports from Taiwan are suspended with immediate
effect, the PPD said.
</P>
<P>
Amid growing public fears over a major outbreak of the highly
contagious foot-and-mouth disease among pigs in Taiwan, the
slaughter of more than 100,000 hogs at the infected farms had been
ordered.

<P>
NAIROBI, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Kenya and Eritrea have signed an
agreement abolishing visa requirements for citizens of the two
countries, the Kenya Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
After signing the agreement, Kenyan Foreign Minister Kalonzo
Musyoka said visa abolition would help in boosting bilateral

The Kenyan Minister stated that the agreement was a follow-up
of the visa abolition announcement by Eritrean President Isaias
Afeworki last May.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 25 (Xinhua) -- French "spiderman" Alain
Robert, who was arrested for climbing the world tallest 88-storey
Petronas Twin Towers here without permission last Thursday, has
been given the greenlight to fulfill his wish.
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old Frenchman has been allowed to scale the world's
tallest building on April 5 to raise funds for charity, President
of the 4B Youth Movement Mohd Ali Rustam told reporters here today
after meeting the Frenchman.
</P>
<P>
The 4B Youth Movement will bear Alain Robert's expenses in
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The Frenchman, who was released on bail, has agreed that he
will be responsible for the risk he is taking and will receive 10
percent of the money raised, said Mohd Ali, who is the deputy
transport minister.
</P>
<P>
Mohd Ali said the government decided to allow Robert to scale
the 451.9 meter-high tower in appreciation of his ability and
also in the hope that the event would generate publicity for the
twin towers and the nation.
</P>
<P>
Mohd Ali, who is also the president of the World Assembly of
Youth (WAY), said he had proposed that the money raised by the
event be given to the National Heart Foundation, Malaysian AIDS
Foundation and WAY's Micro-Credit Foundation which will be
launched in June.
</P>
<P>
The Attorney-General's Chambers here Monday decided not to
prosecute Robert for last Thursday's illegal climb of the tower.

<HEADLINE> Heat, Lakers Overcome Adversity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Miami Heat and Los Angles
Lakers were plunged into troubles when their star centers Alonzo
Mourning and Shaquille O'Neal went down with injuries last month.
</P>
<P>
Yet with the return of the centers, the two league powers can
take pride in solid team efforts to vie for their respective
division titles. Currently, Miami, with a slate of 51 wins against
17 losses, leads New York by 2 and a half games in the Atlantic,
while the Lakers, on 45-23, trail Seattle by only three games in
the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Out West, the absence of O'Neal who hyperextended left knee and
Robert Horry who sprained left knee, forced coach Del Harris to
rework his entire starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
Elden Campbell moved to center from power forward, while rookie
Travis Knight, veteran Jerome Kersey and fourth-year forward Corie
Blount have rotated in at Campbell's forward slot.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of O'Neal, Campbell has led the team in scoring
in nine games and Blount also put up big numbers, registering
three double-doubles in a four-game stretch.
</P>
<P>
In Miami, Tim Hardaway increased his heavy workload and
improved in every phase of his game. Hardaway who torched
Washington with a Miami season-high 45 points on March 7, has been
the heart of the Heat.
</P>
<P>
Mourning's absence did not stop Miami from establishing a
franchise record for wins, and continuing its league-best 28-8
road record and fourth best scoring defense.
</P>
<P>
Heat players know only a division title will promise that a
meeting against the favored Chicago Bulls won't come until the
Eastern Conference Finals.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations drug
detection units will soon be introduced in Tanzania to enhance
the fight against drug trafficking, a U.N. statement available
here said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations Information Center's

detection units also include four other east and southern African
countries -- Kenya, Uganda, Zambia and Botswana.
</P>
<P>
The five countries will begin training in a US 250,000 Dollars
regional anti-drug detector dog program funded by the United
Nations International Drug Control Program (UNDCP).
</P>
<P>
It further said the select drug enforcement personnel would be

The selected officers would receive training in dog handling,
unit command and veterinary procedures.
</P>
<P>
The participating police units will be provided with dogs,

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Property Market Consolidates in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian property
market consolidated in 1996 from its robust performance with a
higher value against the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The number of transactions at 270,548 in 1996 showing an
increase of 7.4 percent was higher against 251,546 in 1995 when a
15.8 percent increase was recorded, according to the 1996 Property
Market Report released here today.
</P>
<P>
The value of transactions showed an increase of 22.9 percent in
1996 over a 34.1 percent increase in 1995 but with a higher of
48.99 billion ringgit (about 19.596 billion U.S. dollars) against
39.86 billion ringgit (15.944 billion dollars) in 1995, the
figures in the report showed.
</P>
<P>
Affordably priced houses continued to attract demand throughout
the country in 1996 when houses below 75,000 ringgit (30,000
dollars) formed almost half of the total houses transacted and
those within the price range of 50,000 ringgit (20,000 dollars) to
75,000 ringgit (30,000 dollars) were the most widely transacted in
the country, it said.
</P>
<P>
During the year under review, the residential and agricultural
sectors showed a smaller percentage increase in the total number
of transactions while a drop was seen in the commercial and the
industrial sectors.
</P>
<P>
The construction of several large civil-engineering projects
and the acceleration of low and medium cost development in 1996
are expected to sustain the pace of growth, the report said.
</P>
<P>
There was a conspicuous decline in the number of housing units
being constructed, with approvals for construction by the Ministry
of Housing and Local Government dropping by 17.0 percent in 1996
over 1995, it said.
</P>
<P>
Advertising of new housing projects also dropped by 7.5 percent
in the first eight months of the year, reflecting the expected
decline in demand.
</P>
<P>
The report said however, construction of low and medium-cost
houses is expected to accelerate in the coming year due to,
firstly, the participation of the Employees Provident Fund (EPF)
which is expected to expedite the pace of development of such
houses.
</P>
<P>
The EPF provided withdrawals for non low-cost houses amounting
to estimated 665.72 million ringgit (266.288 million dollars)
between January and October 1996 against 535.26 million ringgit
(214.104 million dollars) during the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the Low Cost Housing Fund received a boost with
another 1 billion ringgit (400 million dollars) added to the 3.4
billion ringgit (1.36 billion dollars) to build affordable housing
 shelters for the low-income group.
</P>
<P>
The report said there were suggestions that prices of most
types of houses have continued to rise against a backdrop of a
consolidating market in terms of the number of transactions.
</P>
<P>
There was also an evidence to suggest that while non-housing
construction activities will continue to increase, housing
construction activities may decrease in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
The amount of loans by commercial banks and financial
institutions for building and construction in 1996 grew by 75
percent over 1995, real property sector was up by 20.6 percent but
that of the housing sector bucked the trend, according to figures
supplied by the National Bank.
</P>
<P>
In the first 10 months of 1996, only 598 million ringgit (239.2
million dollars) were released to the housing sector, a drop of 75
percent compared with 2.46 billion ringgit (984 million dollars)
worth of loans released to the housing sector for the same period
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, figures supplied by the Housing Loans Division of
the Ministry of Finance showed the number of housing loans
decreased to 12,464 from 17,700 with amount dropping to 814.27
million ringgit (325.708 million dollars) from 1.12 billion
ringgit (448 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Despite measures to make it more expensive for foreign
interests to purchase landed property in Malaysia, the total
number of acquisitions of properties by foreign interests
increased slightly to 229 in 1996 from 227 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Foreign interests were keen on investment properties in the
form of commercial, development and industrial properties while
residential units formed less than 10 percent of the total
acquired.

<HEADLINE> Taxi Firms Encouraged to Be Merged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- China's big cities are putting
the squeeze on taxi companies by denying them new licences and
encouraging successful fleets to merger, today's "China Dialy"
reported.
</P>
<P>
It's a part of a nationwide drive to improve service for
customers by phasing out the smaller and less reliable operators.
</P>
<P>
Beijing now leads the country in its more than 1,400 taxi
companies and a fleet of 60,000 cabs.
</P>
<P>
Limited by the weak-load highway network which hardly supported
the surge of taxi supply, Beijing stopped approving new taxi
licensces in 1994. That left the small fish taxi firms to be
hunted by the big fish anxious to expand their fleets.
</P>
<P>
Small-sized companies form the mainstay of the city's taxi
fleets. About 1,300 companies own less than 100 vehicles. Some
operators have no more than 20 cabs.
</P>
<P>
The large number of taxi companies -- with small firms forming
the bulk of operators -- meant unavoidable chaos in terms of
service quality and charges, said an official with the Beijing
Municipal Taxi Administration.
</P>
<P>
The momentum of merger and acquisition is encouraged, which is
expected to make taxi mangament more effective, added the official.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai now ranks second after Beijing to boast 550 taxi firms
and a fleet of 36,000 cabs.
</P>
<P>
Big taxi companies are advocated to merge with small ones in
accordance with the market rule, according to an official with the
 Shanghai Urban Taxi Administration.
</P>
<P>
And large taxi operators play a key role in the improvement of
service quality because small ones must follow suit to survice,
added the Shanghai official.
</P>
<P>
The northeast coastal city of Dalian tried an alternative
measure in 1992, regulating the minimum fleet of vehicles at 20
cabs then. Dalian's 100 taxi companies are now led by the Blue
Light Taxi Co.

<HEADLINE> China Sells 31.15 Billion Yuan in Certificate Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Certificate bonds this year were
met with great enthusiasm from buyers, with almost 31.15 billion
yuan-worth already sold by March 20 -- 25.32 percent of the

</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Finance show that the

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 10.56 billion yuan-worth of two-year bonds
were sold from March 1 through 20, almost 42.3 percent of the
projected issue. Sales of five-year bond have reached 4.657
billion yuan, accounting for 18.63 percent of their scheduled
quota.
</P>
<P>
The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China led all the five
designated selling banks with a sales amount of 15.213 billion
yuan. The China Construction Bank came next, with a volume of
6.233 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
China has voiced its plan to issue 123 billion yuan in
certificate bonds this year, between March 1 and October 20.
</P>
<P>
China's treasury bonds issue has been growing rapidly in recent
years, to 195 billion yuan-worth last year, and the total amount
is expected to reach more than 250 billion yuan for 1997.

<HEADLINE> Hebei Optimizes Export Commodity Structure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, March 25 (Xinhua) -- To optimize its export
commodity structure, north China's Hebei Province has improved its
commodity quality, and diversified its markets and foreign trade
strategy.
</P>
<P>
An official with the provincial government has said that Hebei
will increase the export quota of mechanical and electrical
equipment in 1997, making it account for 15 percent of the
province's total exports.
</P>
<P>
A major force in foreign trade, the export quota of
overseas-backed enterprises covered 20 percent of the total export
in 1996. This year, Hebei will combine its practice of attracting
overseas investment with expanding export.
</P>
<P>
Customs statistics show that Hebei imported two billion US
dollars-worth of commodities in 1996. The province has carried out
a foreign trade strategy of using imports to strengthen
exports. Centering on import, economic development and export, the
province has increased export scale and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Hebei will reorganize its structure of export-oriented
enterprises and carry out import and export agent systems in
1997.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Resumption of Bilateral Talks Widely Welcomed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Both India and Pakistan have
agreed to resume their foreign secretary-level talks, stalled
since January 1994, on March 28-31 for improving their bilateral
ties and this move has been widely welcomed by both countries.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers and prime ministers of the two countries are
also expected to meet for the same purpose in early April and May.
The public opinion of the two countries maintains that the
resumption of Indo-Pakistan bilateral talks is not only in the
interest of the two countries and two peoples, but also conducive
to regional cooperation and development.
</P>
<P>
Since last year, prime ministers of the two countries in their
exchange of letters have expressed their willingness to resume the
talks for improvement of the bilateral relations and this year
their desire has become stronger.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan newly elected Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has said
time and again that he wanted to revive peace talks with India as
"it would be in the interest of both countries." "Through
dialogue, we should resolve our problems and then move towards
prosperity," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his greeting message on February 17 to Nawaz on his
assumption of office as Pakistan's new prime minister, Indian
Prime Minister Deve Gowda said that India was "ready and willing
to have wide ranging comprehensive talks on all issues of mutual
concern."
</P>
<P>
"To commemorate 50 years of the end of colonial rule, the two
great nations and their political leadership should dedicate
themselves to the historic task of correcting the aberrations of
the past and seek to reshape history and press forward in
friendship and cooperation to create a better life for the people
of the neighboring countries," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Since their division in 1947, India and Pakistan have gone to
war three times over the disputes of religion and Kashmir, etc.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the relations between the two countries have
turned sour and tense seriously, hampering economic development of
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the two countries have tried to solve their
problems through dialogue at the foreign secretary level, but
failed in January 1994 due to differences over the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
Recently with the new global situation emerging and
strengthening of regional economic cooperation, the two countries
have started pursuing economic reforms and opening-up to the
outside world. They have come to realize day by day that economic
cooperation rather than confrontation will not only benefit their
two countries, but also benefit the south Asian region.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the platinum jubilee celebrations of the Rashtriya
Indian Military College here on March 13, Indian President S.D.
Sharma urged India and Pakistan to join hands in a spirit of
mutual trust and understanding and work together to fight against
poverty and disease in the subcontinent and for the welfare of the
two peoples.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the Institute of Strategic Studies in
Islamabad on March 16, Pakistan Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan
said that India and Pakistan had "both realized the importance of
bilateral discussions if they are to witness a stable future."
</P>
<P>
"Has anybody sat down in India or Pakistan to calculate how
much they have spent on defense from 1948 and how long we continue
doing this?" He asked. "We can compete, India and Pakistan, on an
economic front," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Public opinion is building up in both countries for
normalization of relations. Holding its third session recently in
India's Calcutta since 1994, the Pakistan-India People's Forum for
Peace and Democracy called upon the two governments to sign a
comprehensive treaty by August 15 this year for lasting peace in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The declaration of the meeting participated by leading citizens
of the two countries urged the two governments to begin working to
realize the aspirations of the peoples.
</P>
<P>
Renunciation of force and cessation of all forms of proxy wars
had been unequivocally demanded. Free trade and travel across
borders, unhindered flow of information and publications, lowering
of the cost of communication and mutual "Favored Nation" treatment
had been suggested.
</P>
<P>
While cultural personalities, political leaders and social
activists have raised their voice; Businessmen, industrialists and
traders have also called for regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
That a new wind is blowing across the border is an evident in
the exchange of letters between school children of Mumbai (Bombay)
and Karachi, two biggest port cities of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
A school boy from Karachi recently wrote to his pen-friend in
Mumbai: "I am writing this letter to establish good and cordial
relations between us. In this way most of our fights and disputes
will be over." In response, his Indian friend shared his views.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan will introduce radical
changes in its tariff and taxation systems this week by lowering
down import tariff to 45 percent and levying agricultural tax,
local newspapers reported today.
</P>

General sales tax will be reduced to 15 percent and income tax
will also be cut down.
</P>
<P>
All non-essential public services, most of which are provided
by the public sector corporations, will be zero-budgeted. This
means that the government will not provide any budget to these
corporations to make up deficit.
</P>
<P>
An ordinance of agricultural income tax, promulgated by the
caretaker government, is also being converted into an act.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Export Growth Target Endorsed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Economic Affairs
Screening Committee Monday endorsed an official export target of
1,550 billion baht (62 billion U.S. dollars) for 1997,
representing a growth of 10 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
The committee rejected as unrealistic a Commerce Ministry
target of 1,620 billion baht (64.8 billion dollars), or 15 percent
growth, according to Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Virawan.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the country's export was only 0.4 percent higher
than the year before.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's export is expected to improve this year as a result
of expected higher world economic growth and higher world trade.
</P>
<P>
Improved export prospects are seen in important markets
including ASEAN, the United States, Japan and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
To remove export obstacles to exporters, the Thai government
has promised to help boost export by speeding up value-added tax
refunds.
</P>
<P>
Among the more promising sectors are electrical appliances,
electronic goods, jewelry, automobiles and parts, canned seafood,
canned fruit and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN will remain the top export market, with a forecast of
an 11.7 percent increase. Exports to the EU are forecast to grow
by 10.6 percent, to Japan up 10 percent and the U.S. up 9.8
percent.

<HEADLINE> Sino-French Economic Cooperation on Steady Rise (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Since the governments of China and
France in a joint communique in January 1994 declared the full
normalization of bilateral ties, a new page has been turned in the
development of relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the active support of the leaders and the joint
efforts of the economic and entrepreneurial circles of China and
France, the economic and trade relations between the two countries
have entered a period of steady rise and vigorous development.
</P>
<P>
The political relationship between China and France is the
driving force behind their economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
The visit paid to France by Chinese President Jiang Zemin in
September 1994 and that to China by former French Prime Minister
Edouard Balladur in April 1994 signaled the return of Sino-French
relations to the track of normal development.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations were further developed by the successful
visit to France by Chinese Premier Li Peng in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the foreign ministers of the two countries have made
a number of visits to each other's country and held talks on
several occasions to exchange views on issues of common interest
and to coordinate their respective positions.
</P>
<P>
They reached identical or similar views on many important
international issues in those talks.
</P>
<P>
All these high-level visits and political consultations have
strongly pushed forward the development of lasting, steady and
friendly relations between China and France, and have laid a firm
basis for economic cooperation of equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Both China and France are nations of strong influence in the
world, and cooperation between the two in economic fields have a
wide-range basis.
</P>
<P>
France is the world's fourth biggest exporting nation and the
third largest nation of investments.
</P>
<P>
China's economy is experiencing a speedy, lasting and sound
development and the country represents a huge potential market.
So, China and France have a wide perspective for carrying out
cooperation in economic and trade fields.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics provided by the Customs of
China, the trade between the two countries has been keeping a
momentum of growth over the past two years, with bilateral trade
attaining 4.49 billion U.S. dollars in 1995 -- which was 33.5
percent more than 1994 -- and 4.15 billion U.S. dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, France has been active in making investments in
China. In the first nine months of 1996, French businesses signed
a total of 146 contracts with their Chinese counterparts, which
were estimated at 244 million dollars and represented a 79-percent
increase over the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
French funded projects in China now amount to about 1,103 with
an estimated value of 1.3 billion dollars. The fields these
projects cover include automobiles, electronics, brewery, and
plastic materials.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng's official visit to France last year further
promote the economic and trade cooperation between the two
countries.

During Premier Li's visit, China and France signed a number of
economic and trade cooperation agreements which amounted up to 2.4
billion dollars, including the purchase by China of 33 Airbus
passenger aircraft.
</P>
<P>
France owns and produces the world's most advanced technologies
and products in the fields of agriculture, energy, aeronautics,
airspace industry, transportation, telecommunications and
chemistry. All these are among the fields for priority
development in China.
</P>
<P>
China and France are now beginning to realize a joint project
of developing 100-seat passenger aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, France's small and medium-sized enterprises are also
tapping the Chinese market for cooperation in food processing and
garment production.
</P>
<P>
Although Sino-French economic and trade cooperation have
greatly developed, such cooperation still have great potentials
because of the economic power of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to French official statistics, bilateral trade volume
between China and France only accounts for 1.7 percent of China's
overall overseas trade volume.
</P>
<P>
France is ranked China's 11th trade partner, behind Germany and
Italy, while its investment in China is also smaller than those of
Germany and Britain.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day France-China economic seminar held in
Beijing last week, French business and trade representatives led
by former Prime Minister Raymond Barre discussed with their
Chinese counterparts ways to strengthen and further economic and
trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The President of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress of China, Qiao Shi, will begin a visit in France
on Tuesday. And French President Jacques Chirac will pay a state
visit to China in May.
</P>
<P>
The two visits are expected to strongly push forward the
relations of comprehensive cooperation between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Dini of Italy Calls for Furthering European Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The journey toward European
integration must not stop now, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini said on the eve of the 40th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome.
</P>
<P>
The treaty of Italy, France, West Germany, the Netherlands,
Belgium and Luxembourg created the European Economic Community
that later was turned into the 12-member European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Through the years after the signing of the document on March
25, 1957, by the six countries, "history has taught us that the
journey toward European integration must not stop," Dini said.
</P>
<P>
"There is a need for a permanent renewal...if we want to be up
to the task of meeting new challenges," Dini wrote in the preface
to a dossier titled "40 Years of Europe: An Agenda for the Union".
</P>
<P>
He discussed, in the booklet prepared by the official ANSA news
agency, about what the ongoing EU integration could bring along --
a single market and currency, institutional reform, and others.
</P>
<P>
EU foreign ministers will meet here on Tuesday to mark the
treaty's anniversary and attend a session of the intergovernmental
conference to revise the Maastricht Treaty on European Union.
</P>
<P>
The session is key to a "common European security and foreign
policy to restore the EU's legitimacy and to dispel skepticism,"
Dini and his French counterpart Herve de Charette said in a joint
article in today's French newspaper Le Monde.
</P>
<P>
"The Albanian crisis has shown how much of our journey toward
European integration still remains if the EU wants to impose
itself with authority on the international scene and to achieve a
truly united security and foreign policy," the two ministers said.
</P>
<P>
They also called for finding an "authoritative person" to
handle the EU's foreign policy, introducing majority voting in the
decision-making process of the EU Council of Ministers, and fully
integrating the Western European Union, the European military
alliance, into the EU.

<HEADLINE> Klestil: EU Develops Into Real Important Community </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Austrian President Thomas Klestil
said today that the European Union (EU) had developed into a
really important community, and the core guarantor of security and
stability in Europe.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in a news release on the eve of the 40th
anniversary of the Treaty of Rome. This historic pact was signed
in Rome, Italy on March 25, 1957 between West Germany, France,
Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg to forge peace and
create a common market in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The result of the treaty was the establishment of the European
Economic Community which is now the EU, which ranges from Ireland
to Greece and Finland to Spain.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian president said Europe's unification had not been
geographically or "substantially achieved yet".
</P>
<P>
"The common worry that Europeans now have about employment,
social and environmental problems as well as internal and external
security becomes quite urgent," Klestil said.
</P>
<P>
The European continent is much larger than the 15-nation bloc,
Klestil said, urging that more efforts must be made not only for
European residents, but also with them to jointly build Europe.
</P>
<P>
Klestil stressed that "the longest peaceful period in the
European history" resulted from unification above all. For every
European, to do a bit more now for the unification would mean a
step forward toward more peace, security and prosperity in the
future.
</P>
<P>
He said Austrians, who once suffered with other Europeans from
decades of divisions in Europe, were especially concerned about
unification in the entire continent.

<HEADLINE> Romania to Stabilize Exchange Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Romania will stabilize the
exchange rate between the Romanian currency, the leu and the
U.S. dollar, at the rate of one dollar to 7,000-7,500 lei.
</P>
<P>
The director of the Romanian National Central Bank, Mugur
Isarescu, said on Sunday that the revaluation of the leu was not
conducive to the country's exports.
</P>
<P>
The market quotation of foreign exchange in Romanian state
banks was one dollar to 7,011 lei today, but it was one dollar to
6,900 lei in exchange markets, the director said.
</P>
<P>
In the first two months of this year, the exchange rate between
the leu and U.S. dollar slumped from one dollar to 4,100 lei at
the beginning of 1997, to one dollar to 9,000 lei in February,
causing price hikes.
</P>
<P>
In early March, banks in Romania raised the interest rate of
the leu and the rate of exchange in cash between the leu and
dollar, attracting a large amount of leu deposits.
</P>
<P>
This month, Romanian national banks purchased near 100 million
dollars from foreign exchange markets, stopping the further leu
devaluation.
</P>
<P>
Isarescu said foreign currency trade was not allowed in
Romania.

<HEADLINE> Italy, Albania Agree on Naval Patrols in Adriatic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Italy and Albania agreed today on
arrangements for naval patrols in the Adriatic Sea to stop the
flow of refugees and illegal immigrants to southern Italy.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came during a meeting between Italian Prime
Minister Romano Prodi and his visiting Albanian counterpart
Bakshim Fino.
</P>
<P>
Since the breakdown in law and order in Albania precipitated
the crisis there earlier this month, around 12,000 Albanians have
taken refuge in Italy.
</P>
<P>
Initially, the Albanians coming to Italy were considered
genuine refugees. But the authorities in Italian port city of
Brindisi said today the Albanians now arriving were illegal
immigrants who came from areas without disturbances.
</P>
<P>
Their transport, often on rusty and leaking crafts, was
arranged by criminal gangs who were making money from the crisis,
Italian officials said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that about 570 Albanians arrived in Brindisi
today, but the local Prefect ordered the arrest of all the crews
and the seizure of all boats bringing people across the sea.
</P>
<P>
"Controlling the Adriatic will mean stemming the flow of the
illegal immigrants," Prodi told reporters after meeting with Fino.
</P>
<P>
Fino said, "The two governments will collaborate on the problem
of emigration. The time has come for this problem to be tackled
in a more decisive manner."
</P>
<P>
The agreement on naval patrols came after the European Union
(EU) foreign ministers in Brussels agreed on sending humanitarian
aid to Albania with escort.
</P>
<P>
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said Italy had been
asked to lead the escort force, which would also include French,
Spanish and Portuguese units.
</P>
<P>
Hans van Mierlo, the deputy Dutch president of the Council of
Ministers, said the humanitarian aid valued at 2 million ECU
(about 2.3 million U.S. dollars) would be sent to Albania in the
first instance.
</P>
<P>
It could be followed by further shipments after a consultative
mission to Albania submitted a report, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he noted the mandate of the protection force would
be a limited mission, defined by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
Italy has been assembling troops and equipment in Brindisi in
anticipation of an EU decision to send a force to protect food-aid
shipments to Albania.
</P>
<P>
The EU ministers will meet again in Rome on Tuesday, and Fino
will also attend the meeting to discuss Albania's problems.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: EU Reaches Turning Point After 40 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- After 40 years, the European
Union (EU) is finding itself confronted with the most difficult
choice it has ever been compelled to make: to run the risk of
moving forward with its integration plan or to stay calm and think
about it for a while.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of EU's 15 member countries were scheduled to
meet Tuesday in Rome to mark the signing on March 25, 1957, of the
Treaty of Rome. The pact created a common market among West
Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
The European Economic Community (EEC) was established by the
pact. Once comprising what the European Union is now, it has been
enlarged to 15 member states -- and a dozen countries are waiting
at its doorstep.
</P>
<P>
Even Russia, which is firmly opposed to NATO expansion toward
its borders, has expressed interest in joining in.
</P>
<P>
The idealistic experiment in cooperation among governments,
which was conducted by the founding fathers of European
integration, has so far achieved its original goal of binding the
continent's economies closely together and making war unthinkable
among countries of western Europe.
</P>
<P>
The EU is making every effort to realize its most ambitious
dream: Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) by January 1, 1999. But
it is far from being satisfied with the present extension of
integration, insisting on the Treaty of Rome's fundamental goal of
an "ever closer union".
</P>
<P>
Some skeptics say this would be too good to be true.
</P>
<P>
Integration in sensitive areas, such as a common currency and
border controls, has prompted a nationalist backlash while
expansion from the six original members to the current 15 -- and
even to a dozen more -- has frayed consensus over policy
objectives.
</P>
<P>
Faced with the issue of mass unemployment, people across the
continent -- including Britons who have long been at odds with
the EU over its integration plan -- are beginning to cast doubts
over the efficiency of a common market in providing solutions.
</P>
<P>
The EU seemed to be paralyzed when Renault workers took to the
streets to protest the abrupt closure of an auto plant in Belgium,
an incident that has posed a big challenge to the EU's dream of
economic integration.
</P>
<P>
Few politicians on the continent would question the rationale
of integration at a time when economic globalization prevails in
the world. But welfare systems and labor rules remain in the
hands of national governments of EU member states.
</P>
<P>
Wim Kok, Dutch prime minister and EU president who is leading
talks on EU reform, said: "In my view, there is no alternative to
the further development of integration."
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, confronted with
the thorny issue of a record jobless rate at home and the
possibility of seeing a weaker Euro after the inclusion of the
Italian lira and the Spanish peseta, argued that European
integration was a question of peace or war.
</P>
<P>
Under a common market, some richer countries must sacrifice
themselves somewhat in order to be fair to other nations -- not to
mention other problems integration could cause.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, financial markets in Europe -- though admitting
there is political will behind the EMU -- have come to see the
necessity of a delay in launching the single currency until more
countries are ready.
</P>
<P>
Equally fortunate, Europeans have realized there are problems
with the integration plan and they are beginning to do something
about these problems. The budget-cutting reforms being undertaken
on behalf of monetary union will strengthen Europe's capacity to
grow and create jobs, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
The choice remains a difficult one. Meanwhile, as Wim Kok
said, tensions and doubts reflect the far-reaching nature of
imminent decisions on a single currency and constitutional reforms
which will shape Europe into the 21st century.

desired limit and provide medical subsidies only to personalities
of national importance, it added.

Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand pledged to reduce
administrative expenditure and facilities for ministers under the
principle of austerity.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Receive Food, Medicine Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Iraq is soon to receive
its much needed food and medicine in exchange for the oil it has
pumped out since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
So far 57 related contracts have been approved and more
applications have been submitted, according to Portugal's Antonio
Monteiro, who is chairing the United Nations Security Council
committee concerning the situation between Iraq and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese ambassador to the United Nations told a press
briefing today after a closed-door meeting on the issue: "We have
the agreement on priorities."
</P>
<P>
He said: "We have to go further to look at some specific
issues."
</P>
<P>
An official from the Iraqi mission to the U.N. told the press
that about 1 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil has been exported
by different Iraqi companies since January. He expected food and
medicine start arriving in Iraq early next month.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate transportation, Jordan had applied to fly regular
flights into Iraq, hopefully once a week.
</P>
<P>
Monteiro said Turkish companies were trying to supply some
equipment and pipe lines to speed the transportation of oil.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iraqi official, Iraq was going to complete the
export of another 1 billion dollars worth of oil during the next
three months.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. resolution 986, Iraq is allowed to sell oil
worth 2 billion dollars in exchange for food and medicine over a
period of six months. And 30 percent of the income should be used
to compensate victims of the Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> Pudong Pooling Funds for Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Pudong New Area in Shanghai,
China's largest financial and economic center, has become a
reservoir of cash flow from home and abroad, where Chinese
government could only afford a minor part of the total investment
for its development.
</P>
<P>
Official sources say that a total of 200 billion yuan has been
pumped into Pudong New Area during the Eighth Five-Year Plan
period (1991-1995), of which government investment accounted for
less than 44 percent, peaking at 87.5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Investors from home and abroad have provided most of the cash
needed for fixed assets investment in Pudong New Area over the
past few years, the sources said, adding that a total of 12
billion US dollars of overseas investment in contractual value
has been lured.
</P>
<P>
Pudong New Area has always continued to promote to overseas
investors its rare business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The same attention has also been given by Pudong New Area to
upgrade its investment environment, and to increase the return
rate of investment.
</P>
<P>
So far, these efforts have started to pay back in Pudong, which
has seen a quick growth of overseas investment in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Pudong has built two giant bridges over, and a tunnel under the
Huangpu River, and an efficient road network, over the past years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 100 office buildings have been built in
Pudong, and 8,000 foreign-funded and Chinese enterprises, put into
production.
</P>
<P>
Some well-known overseas multinationals and banks have moved
their headquarters or headquarters in China to Pudong in recent
years, which also brought in a large amount of investment.
</P>
<P>
It is said that Pudong will need a total of 330 billion yuan in
investment in fixed assets during the 1996-2000 period, most of
which will also be funded by home and overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
About one third of the investment needed will be injected in
the massive construction of infrastructure projects, the sources
point out.
</P>
<P>
Construction of an international airport in Pudong, a subway
under the Huangpu River, and other major infrastructure projects
now is well underway.

MONTEVIDEO, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A coalition of leftist parties
in Uruguay announced today a series of measures against the
Senate's six-month suspension of Deputy Leonardo Cinolini.
</P>
<P>
The coalition, known as Frente Amplio (FA), said the sanction

Since last June, Cinolini has been denouncing the alleged
irregularities in contracts signed between the Uruguayan
government and Spanish company Focoes.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, senators of the ruling party of Partido Blanco

of slandering and initiated his suspension.
</P>
<P>
In response, the FA today introduced measures, including
round-table meetings nationwide and the preparation of documents,
to publicize the "unconstitutionality" of the Senate decision.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Waits for Congress' Decision on Marcos Burial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
has said it should be Congress who decides whether or not to bury
the remains of former president Ferdinand Marcos at a heroes'
cemetery in the country, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
"This resolution will have to go through both houses (of
Congress) if it is to be acted upon by the president. Let us await
the action of the entire Congress," Ramos was quoted as saying
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the House of Representatives approved a resolution
urging Ramos to allow the burial of the late strongman at the
Libingan Ng Maga Bayani, a cemetery reserved for government
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Marcos' body remains refrigerated in a crypt at the family
mansion in Batac city in northern Luzon.
</P>
<P>
Press Undersecretary Marcelo Lagmay said Ramos may form a
cabinet cluster on the issue of Marcos burial after a joint
House-Senate resolution is passed.
</P>
<P>
Marcos had ruled the Philippines with an iron hand from 1972 to
1986 before he was finally ousted in a popular rebellion led by
his police chief and defense minister. He fled to the United
States after the rebellion and died there in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, a local power company cut off power supply
to Marcos' crypt after Marcos' widow Emelda failed to pay millions
of pesos of overdue power rates.
</P>
<P>
Emelda then asked Ramos to let Marcos be buried in the heroes'
cemetery as the late president wished in his will.
</P>
<P>
According to Emelda, Ramos had promised to let Marcos rest in
the heroes' cemetery in 1992 in exchange for Emelda's support for
his bid to run for president. But Ramos denied making such a
promise.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- China International Trust and
Investment Corp. (Citic), a major investment arm of the State
Council, is seeking to become a global giant by the year 2000,
today's "China Daily" quoted a Citic official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Set up in 1979 by Rong Yiren, who is now China's
Vice-president, Citic earned 2.47 billion yuan in profits last
year, a 21 percent rise from the previous year. Its assets value
exceeded 191 billion yuan by the end of last year, a nearly 15
percent rise over 1995.
</P>
<P>
Citic made a breakthrough last year by launching a securities
company in January, doing businesses in the fields of securities
trading brokerage, underwriting stock issues, fund management and
financial consulting.
</P>
<P>
Headquartered in Beijing, Citic today is one of the country's
largest investment companies, with its investment involved in
banking, nonferrous metals, machinery, automobiles, real estate
and service industries.

<HEADLINE> Air Assistance Reaches Albania as Life Returns to Normal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- An assistance plane and a
commercial flight landed in this capital city of Albania on Monday
as the country began to return to normal after weeks of anarchy.
</P>
<P>
An Italian Hercules air-force transport plane landed at Rinas
International Airport in Tirana with six tonnes of emergency
medical aid requested by Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim Fino for
the northern part of the country, which is under government
control.
</P>
<P>
Italy has already sent two tonnes of medical aid for the south.
</P>
<P>
The cargo arrived at the airport shortly before an Austrian
Airlines jet landed -- the first Western commercial flight to
arrive there since the airport was closed 11 days ago.
</P>
<P>
Scheduled flights from Switzerland and Germany are expected on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, Albania's largest port of Durres in the north,
some 40 kilometers west of Tirana, reopened as shipping cargo of
thousands of tonnes of wheat flour arrived.
</P>
<P>
Albania's key roads running from Tirana to other countries were
to reopen this week.
</P>
<P>
Passenger traffic between Tirana and Macedonia's capital of
Skopje, as well as Turkey's largest city of Istanbul, were also
scheduled to resume this week, government sources said.
</P>
<P>
The reopen of airport, ports and roads are visible signs that
life is returning to normal in Albania, where order has broken
down in wide areas in the south after an armed revolt erupted this
month.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Fino flew to Rome for talks on how Europe can bring
aid to Albania and help it restore order.

international police force organized by European organizations to
safeguard the security of Albania, where more than 100 people have
been killed in armed unrest throughout the country over the past
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Oymen is the first high-ranking Turkish official to visit
Albania since violence erupted in this Balkan country over the
collapse of investment schemes that had bankrupted thousands of
families.

<HEADLINE> Albania Calls on Soldiers to Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Albania's Defense Ministry today
appealed to the servicemen to return to their barracks as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
The ministry called on all soldiers who were serving in the
army, and who had left temporarily, to return to their barracks to
protect Albania's freedom, independence and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
"Albania is in an unusual situation and your motherland is
waiting for you," the Defense Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that most compulsory servicemen among Albania's
45,000-strong troops deserted their posts when anti-government
protesters began raiding armories and barracks for weapons earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
Violence erupted in southern Albania in January over the
collapse of high-risk government investment schemes, in which
thousands of Albanian families lost money.
</P>
<P>
The situation worsened earlier this month after violence
escalated into armed conflicts and spread to most parts of the
Balkan country. More than 100 people were killed and 12,000
Albanians fled Italy.
</P>
<P>
The European Union, which turned down an Albanian request for
large-scale military intervention to help restore order, has
decided to send a team of two dozen civilian and military experts
there to give advice on rebuilding the country's disintegrating
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The union also agreed to provide the nation with immediate food
and medical aid worth two million ecus (about 2.3 million
U.S. dollars), most of which is earmarked for orphanages, old-age
homes and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Restoring order is seen as the top priority for the newly
established Albanian government for national reconciliation. But
armed protesters in the south have refused to surrender their
weapons unless President Sali Berisha, who is blamed for the
failed investment schemes, resigns.
</P>
<P>
However, Berisha refused to resign and said he would step down
only if his Democratic Party lost the forthcoming general
elections in June.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Consumes Less Gasoline in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Gasoline consumption in
Venezuela's automobile sector decreased by 7 percent, or 14,000
barrels per day, to an average of 183,000 barrels per day in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The lower gasoline consumption, relative to 1995, was in line
with a 6-percent drop in the sales of liquid fuels in the country,
the state-owned petroleum company PDVSA said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
While the year saw the sales of liquid fuels decreasing to
354,000 barrels per day, the daily sales of natural gas increased
by 6 percent to an equivalent of 296,000 barrels of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
The automobile sector's gasoline consumption accounted for 51.8
percent of Venezuela's use of all liquid fuels last year.
</P>
<P>
Total supplies of hydrocarbons, including liquid fuels and
natural gas, showed a decrease of 1 percent last year compared
with 650,000 barrels per day in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Besides the shift of consumption from gasoline to natural gas,
higher fuel prices was another factor in the drop of gasoline use
in 1996, said the PDVSA statement available here today.

BUENOS AIRES, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Argentina's public debt
increased by 10 percent to a record high of 97.105 billion
U.S. dollars in 1996, a fiscal bulletin said today.
</P>
<P>
The bulletin, released by the economy ministry, reported that
68.841 billion dollars of the debt was related to public bonds and
securities in local and foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
Multilateral institutions such as the Inter-American
Development Bank, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund
and Fonpolata were in second place with 16.367 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The country also owed 10.162 billion dollars to the Paris Club,
1.452 billion dollars to private banks and 283 million dollars to
other interests.
</P>
<P>
The bulletin reported that the country's public debt per capita
was 2,942 dollars by the end of 1996.

<P>
Argentina's foreign debt increased sharply during the 1980s and
rose to 65 billion dollars in 1991, making it the third largest
debtor in the region.
</P>
<P>
During the early 1990s, the country was seriously in arrears to
its creditors. Agreements negotiated with banks reportedly had

policy commitments.

In 1995, Argentina's foreign debt soared to 87 billion

MANILA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A home-made bomb exploded in a
voters' registration center in Metro Manila Monday, sending into
panic registrants for the May 12 Philippine community elections,
the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Police said the bomb exploded at 11:45 a.m. at a high school

began to swell, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
But fortunately, no one was reported killed or injured by the

<P>
Police said the bomb was hurled into the school by an

<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Colombia spent about
260,000 U.S. dollars during the first two months of this year on a
campaign to prevent dengue disease in the country.
</P>
<P>
The campaign consists of speeding up fumigation and
biological control through a bacteria that destroys mosquito
larvae.
</P>
<P>
Health Ministry figures show 588 cases of hemorrhagic dengue
and 1,134 cases of classical dengue were reported in Colombia
between January and February.
</P>
<P>
Dengue is transmitted by the aedes aegypti mosquitos which
breed in warm climates.
</P>
<P>
Classical dengue has symptoms similar to bad flu accompanied by
fever, pain in the joints, vomiting and a lack of appetite. The
hemorrhagic variety causes bleeding in the gums and nose apart
from the symptoms of classical dengue.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The chairman of Spanish club
Deportivo de La Coruna lost his appeal Monday against an 18-month
ban slapped on him after he sought to overturn a Spanish
federation sanction in local courts.
</P>
<P>
FIFA upheld the February 10 decision of its disciplinary
committee, which suspended Augusto Cesar Lendoiro "from all
football activities" until August 1 1998.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the club was found "jointly liable" and ordered to
pay a fine of 100,000 Swiss Francs (71,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Lendoiro was suspended after he went against FIFA norms when he
appealed to an ordinary Spanish court to overturn a Spanish
federation order to close his club's stadium for one game, a
sanction imposed after a referee was hit by a coin during a match
last October.

WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Jim Courier, showing glimpses
of the fire that made him number one in the world five years ago,
won a tough third-round match at the 4.45 million US dollars
Lipton Championships on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Courier, ranked 26th and still struggling to regain the form
that won him two Australian and two French Open titles, fought
hard from 4-1 down in the third set to defeat talented Australian
lefthander Scott Draper 4-6, 6-1, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Draper, 22, won the first set 6-4 before going off the boil in
the second to drop it 6-1. But in the third set the Australian led
4-1 before Courier fought back and served out the match 6-4 as
Draper netted a backhand return.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Muster of Austria, the second seed, handed 166th-ranked
Tommy Haas a lesson on stadium court, defeating the 19-year old
German prospect 6-1, 6-2 in 52 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The women's second seed was upset when Arantxa Sanchez Vicario
of Spain played a lacklustre match with little-known Sandrine
Testud of France, going out 6-0, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
Testud, ranked 29th, missed a match point at 5-4 but the
usually tigerish Spaniard could not force a comeback, going out on
the second match point with a netted forehand.
</P>

Top seed Martina Hingis of Switzerland was tested in her
fourth-round match before beating Russia's Elena Likhovtseva 6-3,
2-6, 6-3.

<P>
MADRID, March 24 (Xinhua) -- World player of the year Ronaldo
said on Monday the "door is open" for him to leave Barcelona at
the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian striker said he felt he had a right to negotiate
with other clubs because club president Jose Luis Nunez had not
kept an agreement to improve his contract.
</P>
<P>
Barcelona, inspired by his breath-taking displays, had
indicated to open negotiations over a new contract, which would in
theory have raised Ronaldo's price to at least four billion
pesetas (27.8 million US dollars) and his annual pay cheque from
an estimated 200 million pesetas (1.39 million US dollars) to 500
million (3.47 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, Barcelona now say no new deal will be reached before
the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
The young Brazilian was signed from Dutch side PSV Eindhoven in
the close season for a then world-record fee of 2.5 billion
pesetas (17.4 million US dollars).

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan will
meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington on April 1 for
talks on the Middle East peace process and bilateral issues, the
White House said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The King's trip was to have taken place two weeks ago, but was
postponed partly because Clinton had to undergo surgery for a knee
injury and partly because of regional developments, after a
Jordanian soldier opened fire on a group of Israeli schoolgirls,
killing seven of them and injuring six more.
</P>
<P>
The king's trip to Washington is the last in a series of
scheduled meetings in Washington between U.S. administration
officials and leaders of the core Middle East peace process
states.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was the first to come
to Washington at the end of February, and his visit was followed
by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak in March.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the trip comes at a time when Palestinians
in the West Bank clashed with Israeli soldiers for a fifth
consecutive day.
</P>
<P>
The clashes broke out last after Israeli began construction of
6,500 new housing units for Jews on the Jerusalem hilltop called
Abu Ghnaim.
</P>
<P>
The move outraged Palestinians, who want east Jerusalem as
the capital of a future state and resent Israeli attempts to
assert sovereignty over the entire city.

The two rebel delegates are Bizima Kahaha and Gaetan Kakudji,
both responsible for foreign affairs in the rebel camp led by
Laurent Kabila.
</P>

"This is a very important development for creating an
environment for a negotiated settlement, negotiations and
cessation of hostilities," Mohamed Sahnoun, the joint special
envoy of the U.N. and OAU, told Xinhua today.
</P>

He said the Zairean governmental delegates will also attend

<HEADLINE> Britain Attaches Importance to Relations with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- British Deputy Prime Minister
Michael Heseltine said here today Britain attaches importance to
developing good relations with China.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with General Fu Quanyou, member of China's Central
Military Commission and Chief of General Staff of the Chinese
People's Liberation Army, Heseltine said a smooth hand-over of Hong
Kong to China was a great event and the task of transfer seems
much easier to accomplish now than before as a result of strenuous
efforts jointly made by Britain and China.
</P>
<P>
Britain had good relations with China, he said, adding his
country was the largest European investor in China with improved
bilateral cooperation in the economic field.
</P>
<P>
General Fu, who arrived here Saturday on a five-day official
visit, said it is a world event that China resumes its excercise
of sovereignty over Hong Kong and China hopes the remaining issues
concerning the smooth transfer of power can be resolved properly
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He also said his current visit to Britain was aimed at
enhancing understanding, developing friendship and promoting
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Britain is the last leg of General Fu's current four-nation
European visit which has already taken him to Belgium, France and
Italy.

<HEADLINE> Central African Capital Returns to Calm as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The capital of the Central African
Republic Bangui remained calm today, while representatives of the
African peace-keeping force of MISAB and the mutinous soldiers
held a meeting under the mediation of Malian general Amadou
Toumani Toure.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which were aimed at ending the clashes between
MISAB's Chadian soldiers and the mutinous soldiers in which 11
people were killed and 30 wounded last weekend, went on until the
evening in a neutral field -- the residence of the archbishop of
Bangui, reported the Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
Apart from General Toure, the MISAB military operation chief,
Colonel Talla Niang of Senegal, Captain Anicet Saule of the rebel
side and two other rebel officers took part in today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
The AFP quoted General Toure as saying that the meeting had
"allowed one to go ahead a little" and that it was decided that
"security measures would be reinforced in the field to avoid any
incident."
</P>
<P>
He said that the MISAB and the rebels will meet again on
Tuesday to continue their talks.
</P>
<P>
A rebel officer identified as Lieutenant Mbaye said that the
rebels wanted the immediate withdrawal of the Chadian contingent
from the MISAB, and the guarantee that they would enter the new
government of large openness as has been promised by President
Ange-Felix Patasse.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government of Chad today condemned what it
called "the repeated and unceasing attacks from the mutinous
soldiers, without pretext," against the Chadian soldiers in the
MISAB "who came to contribute to the maintenance of peace while
observing a strict neutrality."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on several kidnappings of Chadian merchants which
took place in Bangui over the past two days, the Chadian
government "warns the Central African government and mutinous
soldiers once more that it would not tolerate any more that the
Chadian citizens be the innocent victims of an internal conflict
in the Central African Republic."
</P>
<P>
The Chadian government said that it would send troop
reinforcement to Bangui to back up the Chadian soldiers already
stationed there.

<HEADLINE> Report: Narcotics-Related Corruption Serious in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Narcotics-related corruption
in the United States is serious and growing at a time when the
latter accusing some other countries of not making enough efforts
to stop drug-trafficking, the New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
At least 46 Federal, state, and local law-enforcement officials
have been indicted on or convicted of drug-related corruption
charges in the last three years in the border states of
California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The cases were only those that related to drugs transported
across the border by land and they represent only a small part of
the problem, Federal law-enforcement officials were quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Many federal officials fear that the problem will grow worse as
drug dealers have become more brazen and the volume and value of
drugs moving across the U.S.-Mexico border have skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
The Customs Service reported that at five border crossings on
the California-Mexico border, marijuana seizures increased to
3,518 in 1996 from 2,490 in 1995. A total of 272,000 pounds of
marijuana were seized last year at the section of border.
</P>
<P>
The Customs Service report indicates that in 1996, around
550,000 pounds of marijuana, 45,000 pounds of cocaine and 500
pounds of heroin were seized at border crossings between Mexico
and the United States. Among the seized drugs, marijuana
increased by more than 25 percent and heroin rose by more than
150 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The report said that serious corruption encouraged drug
traffickers to get drugs into the United States through legal
ports of entry instead of trying to bring them across at remote
border areas.
</P>
<P>
In Zapata County, Texas, most of the courty's leaders,
including the county judge, the sheriff and the clerk, were
convicted of or pleaded guilty in Federal court to charges of
aiding the international drug trafficking, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
Corruption of law-enforcement officials has become a corrosive
by product of the vast river of drugs that pours into the United
States, the report said.
