<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Calls for Peaceful Solution to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
Sunday called for Arab and Muslim countries to solve disputes by
peaceful means in order to pave the way for economic development
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah made the appeal during his meeting with visiting
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, who arrived in Amman
Saturday on a three-day fence mending visit.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Abdullah said Jordan exerted efforts to
remove the causes of tension and to enable people in the region to
pay closer attention to economic growth and development.
</P>
<P>
He said that conflicts in the region should be settled by
peaceful means and reconciliation, and Jordan fully supports
conflict-preventive diplomacy in the Arab and Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah did not refer directly to the disputes between Iran
and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) over three Gulf islands, Abu
Musa, the Greater and Lesser Tunbs.
</P>
<P>
Press reports here said the UAE has asked Jordan to mediate
over the disputes during Kharrazi's visit.
</P>
<P>
However, after talks with his Jordanian counterpart Abdel-Ilah
al-Khatib on Saturday, Kharrazi said Iran rejected any outside
mediation over the dispute with the UAE over the islands.
</P>
<P>
He termed the dispute as a "bilateral issue" which Iran
preferred to solve directly with the UAE, and said he did not
raise the issue during his talks with al-Khatib.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's ties with Iran remained sour since the 1980s as
Amman sided with Baghdad during the eight-year war between Iran
and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries have been drastically
improved since last month when Abdullah invited Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami to visit Amman.
</P>
<P>
Khatami has accepted the invitation, but has not set a
date to visit the desert kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Marks Africa Refugee Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Civil conflicts in Africa which
have forced people to flee for their lives are the result of
intolerance, poor governance, clamor for power and greed, a senior
official of the U.N. High Commissioner

for Refugees (UNHCR) has said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a gathering here Sunday to commemorate the 30th
anniversary of the Africa Refugee Day, Yvette Stevens, the UNHCR
representative to Kenya, said civil conflicts have expanded the
population of refugees in Africa from one million in 1969 to some
seven million at present.
</P>
<P>
"Civil strife still plague the continent with some 14 countries
at war, which still continue to produce large numbers of refugees
and displaced persons," she noted.
</P>
<P>
While the rest of the world moved ahead, Africa would
retrogress, she said, adding African leaders should preach
tolerance not division; the interest of countries rather than
individuals should take precedence. Only then would one ensure a
safe and happy environment for all.
</P>
<P>
Stevens said most of the arms used in Africa were imported
outside the continent, and appealed to the international
community to declare embargoes on arms import in some African
countries.
</P>
<P>
On the refugee problems in Africa, she said, the UNHCR would
have a role to play in making the lives of refugees more tolerable
and even in resolving the root causes of conflicts.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Shariff Nassir, Kenyan Minister for Home
Affairs, National Heritage, Culture and Social Services, said the
global refugee population had passed the 21 million mark, one
third of which had been produced by Africa.
</P>
<P>
There were some 200,000 refugees in Kenya, he said, adding: "we
have seen the interference to all aspects of life by the refugees
and have seen the over-stretching of our resources and also the
security risks posed by our "guests", especially in the areas
bordering the refugee producing countries.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that the refugees in Kenya are mainly from Sudan,
Somalia, Eritrea and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The Convention on Refugees was signed in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,
by 34 African countries in 1969 and so far 46 nations have signed
the convention.
</P>
<P>
According to UNHCR statistics, Guinea is the largest host of
refugees, taking in more than 413,000, Sudan 319,500, Tanzania
343,900 and Ethiopia 262,000.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sierra Leone is the biggest source of refugees with
409,900, to be followed by Somalia with 401,300, Sudan 372,900,
Eritrea 342,300 and Burundi 299,400.

<HEADLINE> UAE President Receives Phone Call From Saudi Crown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- President of the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan Sunday received
a phone call from the crown prince of Saudi Arabia following the
defusing of a row between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In the phone call, Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz,
who is also deputy prime minister, reviewed with Zayed the results
of the meeting held Saturday between Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-
Aziz and Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa al-Thani, the
official WAM news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was aimed at clearing the atmosphere between the
UAE and Saudi Arabia on a unified stand on issues related to the
general interest of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
UAE newspapers said Sunday that the relations between the UAE
and Saudi Arabia had returned to normalcy following the Qatari
emir's mediation efforts to defuse their quarrel over improving
ties with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia's recent rapprochement with Iran irritated the
UAE, who has always required GCC members, including Saudi Arabia,
the UAE, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain, to help solve its
dispute with Iran first before improving ties with the country.
</P>
<P>
The UAE and Iran both claim the three islands of Abu Musa and
Greater and Lesser Tunbs, which are located near strategic
shipping lanes in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The islands have been occupied by Iran since 1971 when Britain
retreated from the region.
</P>
<P>
In the phone call, Crown Prince Abdullah expressed King Fahd's
great respect for the UAE president who reiterated his
appreciation for Saudi Arabia's support for the UAE, WAM said.
</P>
<P>
The UAE president also expressed his commitment to the "warm
and cordial relations" between the two countries and to uphold
the cooperation to achieve the joint objectives of both peoples.

<P>
CAIRO, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) on Sunday praised
Qatar's efforts to help clear up a misunderstanding between Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
AL Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid said in a statement
that the efforts exerted by Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa
al-Thani underline the keenness of the Arab Gulf states to
maintain strong ties.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid said the efforts "were crowned with success,"
commending the endeavors of Sheikh Hamad to remove inter-Arab
misunderstandings and clear up Arab atmospheres.
</P>
<P>
The warming-up of relations between Gulf countries, including
Saudi Arabia and Qatar, and Iran has aroused dissatisfaction and
suspicion of the UAE, which has disputes with Iran over three Gulf
islands - the Greater Tunb, the Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa.
</P>
<P>
Following a visit to Saudi Arabia and Qatar by Iranian
President Mohammad Khatami early this month, the UAE said the
rapprochement between the two Arab countries and Iran would
jeopardize its interests.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamad paid a short visit to the UAE on Saturday, after
which he, accompanied by UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs
Sheikh Hamdan Bin Zayed al-Nahyan, traveled to Saudi Arabia and
held talks with Saudi King Fahd and Crown Prince Abdullah in a bid
to dispel UAE's suspicion.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Hopes to Improve ties with Iran: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Raouf Rawabdeh said Sunday his country hoped to build up
brotherly ties with Iran on the basis of mutual respect and
non-interference in internal affairs of each country.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks during his meeting with Iranian Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi, the highest-ranking Iranian official to
visit Jordan in more than a decade on a ground-breaking mission.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh said Iran enjoyed a special position among Jordan`s
Islamic brothers, and Amman looked forward to brotherly, friendly
and cooperative ties with Tehran on basis of mutual interests
and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the Jordanian prime minister also encouraged
Iranian investors and entrepreneurs to launch joint ventures in
the kingdom as part of the efforts to strengthen bilateral
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said Iran was willing to deepen its ties with Jordan
and overcome obstacles impeding their progress and development.
</P>
<P>
Tehran was ready to provide expertise for Amman to help
develop the infrastructure and service projects in the kingdom,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi arrived in Amman Saturday on a three-day fence
mending visit which was expected to end the strains of bilateral
relations.

Jordan`s ties with Iran remained sour since the 1980s as Amman
sided with Baghdad during the eight-year war between Iran and

<HEADLINE> Former Egyptian Veteran Dies at 78 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Former vice president of Egypt Kamal
El-din Hussein, one of the army officers who helped Gamal Abdel
Nasser topple Egypt's monarchy in 1952, has died at the age of 78.
</P>
<P>
Egypt on Sunday held a state funeral for Hussein, who died on
Saturday after a long illness and complications from liver cancer,
the country's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Hussein joined Nasser in the "free officers" group during the
1948 war with Israel. When the officers overthrew the monarchy
four years later, he became a member of the ruling Revolutionary
Command Council and minister of social affairs.
</P>
<P>
He later was named one of Nasser's many deputies and headed the
National Guard during the 1956 war against Britain and France
following Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal.
</P>
<P>
Hussein fell out with Nasser when he opposed many of the late
president's policies, especially his heavy-handed style of
governing and favoritism.
</P>
<P>
Hussein went to the United States three times for treatment
after he was diagnosed with liver cancer several years ago.
</P>
<P>
Hussein, who is survived by his wife, three sons and several
grandchildren, was buried in Benha, his hometown in the Nile
Delta.

Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Slovenian Prime
Minister Janez Drnovsek before he ended a three-day visit to
Egypt, Abdel-Meguid said the league is holding contacts with Arab

KUALA LUMPUR, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said here Sunday that the Barisan Nasional (BN)
is now more than ready to face the general election even if the
14-party coalition has to face opposition candidates on a
one-to-one basis.
</P>
<P>
"One-to-two or one-to-three doesn't matter to us. We will take
on everybody," the prime minister said when asked if the BN was
prepared to take on the opposition on a one-to-one basis in the
coming general election.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference at the end of the four-day 53rd
general assembly of the United Malays National Organization (UMNO)
 here, Mahathir who is also UMNO president, said the party would
now move forward and prepare for the general election.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether UMNO was stronger and united in facing the
general election, Mahathir said that based on the party's just
concluded general assembly, the members were now more spirited and
determined to defend and champion the party.
</P>
<P>
"They appeared very solid in responding to my opening speech
and at the closing of the assembly," he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 UMNO delegates attended the assembly, the last
for this century and also before the general election.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the general election would be postponed until a
sodomy case against former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim is
over, the prime minister said the government could not do this.
</P>
<P>
This is because a general election would have to be called once
every five years, he said.

NICOSIA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Sunday expressed grave concern about the situation in Cyprus, the
Cyprus News Agency (CNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the close of a three-day G-8
summit in Cologne, Germany, Chirac said that not much progress has
been made towards the resolution of the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The Group of Eight (G-8) compromises the United States, Canada,
Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Italy and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that "the situation in Cyprus is of great concern,
especially in view of Cyprus' candidacy for EU accession."
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation European Union (EU) "does not wish to import any
important conflicts, it wants them resolved beforehand," said
Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the
island through a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation formula, but so
far no tangible results have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Congo (K) Conflict, Priority for S. Africa's New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Newly appointed South African
Foreign Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said Sunday that she saw
the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) one of her
top priorities.
</P>
<P>
Dlamini-Zuma, who was health minister in former president
Nelson Mandela' s cabinet, was speaking on the SABC television's
News maker program.
</P>
<P>
She said unless the conflict in Africa was resolved there was
no possibility of a renaissance on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Although the latest initiative to bring about peace in the DRC
was being led by Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, South Africa
was giving the process its full support, said the foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
"We would like a cease-fire in the DRC and a standstill of
foreign troops, and (to see) the Congolese beginning a meaningful
dialog to resolve the problems there," she said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa was involved in talks with all the countries
involved in the Great Lakes conflict including the warring parties
in the DRC, Dlamini- Zuma said.
</P>
<P>
An interview with new Deputy President Jacob Zuma last week was
also broadcast during the News maker program. Jacob Zuma is
Nkosazana Dlamini- Zuma's ex-husband.
</P>
<P>
When asked about reports that the deputy presidency was offered
to Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Zuma
said he knew nothing about the issue except what he had read in
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Many people seemed to have mistaken the African National
Congress's (ANC' s) willingness to cooperate with the IFP as a
planned merger between the two parties. However, he said, this had
never been the intention, and the two parties were continuing to
cooperate without considering a merger.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the situation in KwaZulu-Natal, he said he was
optimistic that the conflict between the ANC and the IFP had been
resolved. He said this was shown by the ease with which the
coalition was formed in the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
"I think we could confidently say that we are past the stage
where the problems of KwaZulu-Natal could slip into a state of
chaos," Zuma said.
</P>
<P>
He said he was convinced that the commitment by the parties to
peace in the province was such that development could not take
place without.

KUWAIT CITY, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait Sunday called on India
and Pakistan to exercise self-restraint and solve their disputes
through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made at a weekly cabinet session chaired by
Crown Prince and Prime Minister Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah, the
Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait "followed up with concern the military escalation
between India and Pakistan and the serious threat that such
escalation could pose to the safety and security of both
countries," said Information Minister Yusef Mohammad Al-Sumait
after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait appealed to both sides to exercise self-restraint and to

peaceful means, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
On May 26, India began to pound with heavy artillery and air
strikes "infiltrators" it said backed by Pakistan's armed forces

<P>
Heavy casualties and damages have been reported on both sides
following artillery shelling and fierce fightings.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic efforts, both bilateral and international, have so

<HEADLINE> 3 Civilians Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Three Lebanese civilians were
injured on Sunday in an Israeli bombardment on villages in south
Lebanon, the Voice of the People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The three Lebanese, including a five-year-old girl, were
wounded when an Israeli rocket hit a Lebanese civilian's house at
Gaobrih in the central sector of the Israeli occupied border zone
in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli attack came apparently as a response to previous
military operations launched by guerrillas of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, on its positions inside the zone.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted security sources as saying that the Israeli
authorities have called on its residents in the northern area to
go into underground shelters as a precautionary measures against
possible retaliation by Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah usually fires Katyusha rockets into northern Israel
as a retaliation for the Israeli attacks which have killed
or wounded Lebanese civilians.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to dislodge Israeli occupation forces
and its ally South Lebanon Army out of the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- President Frederick Chiluba Sunday
stressed the need to sign a cease-fire soon to end the 11-month
conflict in Congo (K), describing the conflict as "useless".
</P>
<P>
Speaking here at the inter-denominational prayer service for
the forthcoming peace summit on Congo (K), the Zambian president
attacked the United States and Europe for turning their backs on
the crisis in Congo and putting all their resources in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) with a
population of 50 million should not be treated as less important
just because it is in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The lack of help from Europe and the United States should also
be a lesson to African leaders who should be able to see that
there is no need to start conflicts when they have no resources of
their own, Chiluba noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president said the officials meeting in
preparation for the summit will open in Lusaka Monday.
</P>
<P>
This would be followed by the ministerial meeting before the
heads of state can finally come Saturday or on June 26.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba expressed his hope that both the officials and the
ministerial meetings can pave the way for the summit.

COLOGNE, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Japan and Russia will conclude a
peace treaty before the year 2000, Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi announced here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi made the remark after meeting with Russian President

</P>
<P>
During the bilateral talks, Yeltsin said that he would fulfill
the historical tasks of solving the territorial dispute and
signing the peace treaty with Japan as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo and Moscow issued a joint declaration in 1956, ending the
state of war between them. However, Russia's occupation of the
southern Kuril islands, known to Japanese as their "northern
territories" has prevented the two countries from signing a formal
peace treaty and embarking on full economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi said that Japan will continue its support to Russia for
disposing nuclear weapons and provide funds in this regard.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOGNE, June 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton and
his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin agreed here Sunday to start
bilateral talks on the START III treaty on reducing nuclear
arsenals this autumn.
</P>
<P>
The two also vowed to negotiate further changes in the Anti-
Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty and held consultations on the

Security Adviser Sandy Berger.
</P>
<P>
Berger also said the the Russian government had promised to "
try the best to secure the Duma approval to the START II treaty on
reducing nuclear arsenals".
</P>
<P>
Berger portrayed the two's bilateral talks as a "innovatory
meeting" after the Kosovo war, which had led the U.S.- Russian
ties to the lowest ebb till the ending of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
According to Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, the U.S. and
Russian Presidents signed a document on resuming talks on nuclear
disarmament during their Sunday talks, which served as "a start"
for the bilateral relations to "enter a new and important stage".
</P>
<P>
Before his meeting with Clinton, Yeltsin stressed here in the
last day of the G8 summit the international cooperation on
strengthening global security in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin proposed to formulate a relevant act on international
relations before the next G8 summit, said Ivanov, adding that the
president meanwhile called for a law document governing the use of
military forces in the third country before this year's U.N.
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also expressed his support for a global surveillance
system to limit the ballistic missiles.

<HEADLINE> WB to Further Help Tanzania Solve Debt Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank will continue
to assist Tanzania in solving the debt problem so that the
country's economy could develop at a faster pace, a senior bank
official said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Although Tanzania did not get debt relief at a G-8 summit in
Germany earlier this week, the country does have a debt problem,
World Bank Managing Director and Corporate Secretary Shengman
Zhang told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the World Bank will take measures to alleviate
external debt for Tanzania and that a plan on reducing the
country's commercial debts is being studied. However, he declined
to give details.
</P>
<P>
Burdened with an external debt of around eight billion U.S.
dollars, Tanzania has seen education and health services
deteriorating in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Despite these problems, Tanzania's macro-economic situation has
become stable after years of reform, the bank official said before
leaving for Uganda to continue his African tour.
</P>
<P>
"Tanzania has basically discovered a good reform path," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang praised the rapid development of tourism and mining
during the course of reform, but said the industry sector still
needs to increase its shares in the national economy.
</P>
<P>
"Tanzania's industry is still not fully developed as the sector
 contributes only 15 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP),
a rate which is too low," he said.
</P>
<P>
To accelerate economic development, Tanzania needs to adhere to
 reforms, improve management, expand the private sector, as well
as improve infrastructure, education and health services, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the past four days, the World Bank managing director has
met top leaders of Tanzania, financial figures and private
businessmen. He also toured World Bank-funded projects in various
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The visit, he said, is to learn the situation of Tanzania and
enhance understanding with the government on what to do next.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has actively supported Tanzania's economic
development efforts through more than 130 bank-financed projects
since the 1960s.

<HEADLINE> D'Alema Says Italian Deficit to Come Down by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema said Sunday that Italy's deficit would be lowered to 1.5
percent of GDP by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to Italian news agency ANSA, D'Alema, who is being
present at the Group of Eight economic summit in Cologne of
Germany, said that the deficit target would be reached through a
combination of spending cuts and the easing of Italy's high level
of fiscal pressure, adding that the government was committed to
lowering the amount of taxes paid by low-income families.
</P>
<P>
At the end of May, Italy won permission from other euro-zone
nations to let its 1999 deficit rise to 2.4 percent of GDP from
the agreed 2 percent because of slack economic growth.
</P>
<P>
This decision unleashed a wave of criticism, with some
commentators claiming it represented the first crack in the
monetary union's Stability Pact, and that it was responsible for
the recent weakness of euro.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema went on to say that "no serious analyst would link the
easing of Italy's deficit-GDP ratio to the presumed difficulties
of the euro."
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to appeal to national pride on the issue, because
that's a rare phenomenon in Italy," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that other euro-zone countries might have to follow the
same course as Italy and "some were pleased that Italy clarified
things. It could pave the way for others to do the same."
</P>
<P>
"We asked for our targets to be re-set on the basis of economic
realities," the premier concluded.

<HEADLINE> Demand for Natural Gas to Grow in UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The demand for natural gas in
the United Arab Emirates (UAE) will grow substantially and far
outstrip supply in years to come, according to a recent study.
</P>
<P>
The study, published in the latest issue of Nicosia-based
Middle East Economic Survey, indicated that daily demand for
natural gas in the UAE was projected to grow from 2.6 billion
cubic feet (about 80 million cubic meters) in 1998 to 5.1 billion
cubic feet (about 150 million cubic meters) in 2005 and 6.1
billion cubic feet (about 180 million cubic meters) in 2010.
</P>
<P>
Although natural gas supply in the UAE will also increase, the
study said demand will far outstrip supply, opening the door for
over 2.1 billion cubic feet (60 million cubic meters) of daily
imports by 2005, growing to 3 billion cubic feet (90 million cubic
meters) by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The figures for estimated natural gas demand excluded a plant
at Das Island, which utilizes some 1.2 billion cubic feet (40
million cubic meters) of natural gas daily to produce liquefied
natural gas for export.
</P>
<P>
The figures also excluded a gas condensate recycling project,
due on stream in 2000, which involves recycling some 825 million
cubic feet (24.8 million cubic meters) of wet gas daily to
produce condensate, the study said.
</P>
<P>
The study showed that daily supply of natural gas in the UAE
in 1998 was 2.27 billion cubic feet (about 68.1 million cubic
meters). The figure is expected to go up to 2.99 billion cubic
feet (89.7 million cubic meters) in 2005 and 3.07 billion cubic
feet (92.1 million cubic meters) in the year 2010.

<HEADLINE> Irish Police Make Further Arrest in Omagh Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Police in the Irish Republic said
on Monday they had arrested another man in connection with last
year's bombing at Omagh, bringing to 11 the number being
questioned on both sides of the Irish border since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The arrest was made in the border town of Dundalk, County Louth
late Monday morning, a BBC report said.
</P>
<P>
The latest suspect was in his mid-20s, and was taken for
questioning, the report quoted a police source as saying.
</P>
<P>
Six men were detained following raids on Sunday morning, while
in Northern Ireland four men were arrested in the border area of
South Armagh.
</P>
<P>
Local Irish media reports said all those men were linked to the
Real IRA, the dissident republican faction responsible for the
bomb attack on August 15 last year in the market town of Omagh,
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The bomb killed 29 people outright and injured more than 200,
making it the single worst atrocity in Northern Ireland's
sectarian conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Real IRA, which aimed to derail the British-ruled
province's fragile peace process with the attack, was faced with
security crackdown and public outrage after the attack. The group
called off hostilities soon after the bombing.
</P>
<P>
The main republican guerrilla group, the Irish Republican Army,
declared a ceasefire in its war against British rule in July 1997,
paving the way for last year's Good Friday peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Police on both sides of the border have arrested and released
several suspects in connection with the Omagh bombing over the
last few months. Only one man has been charged.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Declares December 31 Bank Holiday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Monetary Authority of
Singapore (MAS) has decided that December 31 of this year will be
bank holiday, MAS Managing Director Koh Yong Guan said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Koh told those attending the 26th Annual Dinner of the
Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) that the MAS has accepted
the ABS' proposal to declare December 31 a bank holiday.
</P>
<P>
Billing the announcement as part of the MAS' year 2000 efforts,
Koh said this will enable banks to begin their year-end processing
and back-ups early so that these activities are completed in time
for the new year.
</P>
<P>
According to the MAS, a bank holiday is not a public holiday
and it entails:
</P>
<P>
-- Closure of bank branches on December 31, 1999. Bank
customers, however, can still use existing 24-hour banking
services such as ATMs, phone banking and Internet banking.
</P>
<P>
-- A non-settlement day on December 31, 1999. This means that
financial transactions scheduled for settlement on December 31,
1999, will either be brought forward to December 30, 1999, or
postponed to January 3, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Koh announced that Singapore International Monetary
Exchange has recently decided to launch a Singapore dollar
interest rate future contact.
</P>
<P>
This will give investors and financial intermediaries another
instrument to manage their interest rate risks and help promote
greater liquidity in the Singapore dollar bond and derivatives
markets.
</P>
<P>
Koh also urged local banks to seize the opportunities presented
by the Internet and expand their Internet banking capability and
learn from the experience of leading international banks in
managing the disintermediation process and meeting the challenges
posed by the emergence of the capital market.

<HEADLINE> Vancouver Warns of Child Prostitution Boom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Canada's western province of
British Columbia is seeing a boom in child prostitution as a
result of lax enforcement of federal laws, said a Vancouver
social agency Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of children are being used as prostitutes in British
Columbia, largely because the province has failed to do an
effective job in enforcing the federal child prostitution law, the
agency said in its report carried by the newspaper here.
</P>
<P>
Vancouver's Downtown Eastside Youth Activities Society called
child prostitution "an organized growth industry" in the province,
where Vancouver, a major city, is seeing its third generation of
sex trade workers in the same family.
</P>
<P>
The province lags far behind several other provinces such as
Quebec in law enforcement, the report said.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 transactions occur each day in Vancouver
involving the purchase of a child and "there are no barriers to it,
" the report added.
</P>
<P>
The country's federal law forbids buying or attempting to buy
sex from a person under 18. From April 1, 1997, to March 31, 1998,
20 charges were brought under the federal child prostitution law
in British Columbia, compared with 41 charges in Ontario and 67 in
Quebec in the same period.
</P>
<P>
Strict law enforcement has helped Quebec keep child
prostitution under control, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Requests UN to Stop U.S. Spy Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Monday requested
that the United Nations intervene in U.S. spying activities in the
country so as to bring a halt to this practice in the interests of
safeguarding the reputation of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Iraq's
Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz said the United states was
persisting in its unlawful and immoral interference in Iraq's
international affairs by sending agents of its intelligence
services who used the U.N. agencies working in Iraq as a cover
for their activities as spies.
</P>
<P>
"At other times, it sends agents through northern Iraq to
infiltrate the country in order to carry out acts of espionage
and sabotage," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
"The persistence of the United States Administration in
blatantly interfering in Iraq internal affairs and its use of
the United Nations agencies as a cover for its interference is
a flagrant violation of the spirit and letter of the Charter of
the United Nations and of the norms and percepts of
international law," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It constitutes an attempt to destroy the reputation of the
United Nations as an international organization together with
the good name of its personnel, Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
The Deputy Prime Minister requested the U.N. chief that he
intervene to ensure the representatives and personnel of the
United Nations agencies and bodies do not cooperate with these
spies and informers.

<HEADLINE> EU, U.S. to Set up "Early Warning System" for Internal Quarrels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 21 Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) and the United
States will set up an "early warning system" to prevent internal
disputes from escalating into conflicts and ruining their overall
ties, their joint statement issued here Monday said.
</P>
<P>
The statement was signed by US President Bill Clinton, German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and acting European Commission
President Jacques Santer, following the EU-US summit on Monday.
</P>
<P>
During their three-hour meeting, the three leaders agreed to
set up two working groups responsible for political and trade
issues, and to coordinate the so-called "trans-Atlantic
relationship."
</P>
<P>
Under the "early warning system," the interests of the EU and
the US will be taken into account by drawing up political
principles and legal and administrative regulations, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also demanded better communication and more
transparency in the system.
</P>
<P>
The Bonn summit, following the three-day Group of Eight (G-8)
summit in Cologne, focused primarily on two topics, funding Balkan
reconstruction and diffusing EU-US disputes, especially in the
area of trade.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the United States and the 15-member EU have
been quarreling bitterly over a series of trade problems,
including the banana dispute and the hormone-treated U.S. beef.
</P>
<P>
"Too often in the past President Clinton and I have had to
spend time on damaging disputes, even if 98 percent of our trade
is trouble free," Santer said at a press conference after the
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Telecom Sector Sees Appreciable Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's telecom sector has seen
appreciable development in the past two decades and its service
quality is among the best in the South Asian region, a telecom
official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Bala Ram Pradhananga, deputy general manager of the
government-owned Nepal Telecommunications Corporation (NTC), told
Xinhua in an interview that when the NTC was established in 1975,
telecom development in Nepal was only in its infancy.
</P>
<P>
"However, accelerated development in this sector has taken
place since then," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pradhananga said the number of telephone subscribers has
increased from 7,000 in 1975 to more than 210,000 at present and
the installed capacity from 10,000 lines to 250,000.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the average telephone density has increased from a
meager 0.08 per 100 people to one, he said.
</P>
<P>
Now all the 75 district headquarters are linked through
reliable telecom services and about 1,700 of the 3,912
village-level administrative units or village development
committees have access to modern telephone facilities, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that for rural areas there are systems like
point-to-point system VHF and UHF and digital multiple radio
access systems (MARTS) and satellite-based systems (VSAT) have
been deployed.
</P>
<P>
"The NTC's switching and transmission networks were fully
digitized in 1998," he said. "Now 131 countries can be reached
through IDD (international direct dialing) facilities provided by
the NTC."
</P>
<P>
Recently, the NTC launched the GSM (global system for mobile
communications) cellular mobile telephone system in Kathmandu and
is now extending it to three other major cities in the country,
the deputy general manager said.
</P>
<P>
On the NTC's future plans, he disclosed that the NTC has
completed the internal process to install pay phone service in a
few major cities in the kingdom in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The NTC also plans to introduce Internet gateway access in the
near future to help Internet service providers provide better
Internet services and set up a satellite-based trunk network
linking Kathmandu and other major cities to increase the
reliability of the telecom services, Pradhananga said.
</P>
<P>
"The NTC has deployed optical fiber cables in the trunk network
of the Kathmandu Valley and is planning for an east-west optical
network to link the eastern and western parts of Nepal," he added.
</P>
<P>
The telecommunication services available now in Nepal include
local telephone service, national trunk telephone service,
international trunk telephone service, bureau fax service, telex
service, national and international leased service, mobile service
and telegraph service.
</P>
<P>
Private operators are providing other value-added services like
Internet service, E-mail service, voice-mail service and
fax-to-fax service, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pradhananga said his country was the first in the South Asian
region to introduce digital switching technology in the early
1980s and the quality of service is among the best in the region.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the telecom sector accounts for an estimated
1.28 percent of the country's gross domestic product in the
current 1998/99 fiscal year as against 1.21 percent in 1997/98.
</P>
<P>
New targets have been set under the country's sixth telecom
development project (1997-2002), which includes the provision of
telephone services in all major cities, the increase of telephone
density to at least 2.5 percent and the provision of at least one
public-call office in 1,800 more village development committees,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, telephone exchanges will be installed in all
district headquarters and major commercial centers, he said.
</P>
<P>
The NTC has experienced some constraints in the development of
the telecom sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
He cited the lack of financial resources, trained and skilled
manpower and infrastructure like roads and power, brain drain of
experienced employees, high cost of deployment and maintenance of
telephone services in mountainous rural areas, inadequacy of
coordination among government agencies and inflexible rules,
regulations and procedures.
</P>
<P>
He believes that the private sector's involvement will help
boost the development process. With the enactment of the New
Telecommunication Act 1997, the government has given its
commitment to liberalizing the telecom sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Although lately only some value-added services have been open
to private operators, it can be expected that basic services may
be open for competition in the future," Pradhananga said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Gets New Official SEA Games Accreditation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- New Philippine Olympic Committee (
POC) president Celso Dayrit has secured an official accreditation
for the Philippine team to participate in the forthcoming Brunei
Southeast Asian Games (SEA Games).
</P>
<P>
The accreditation and invitation from the Brunei Committee and
SEA Games Federation president Prince Haji Sufri Bulkiah is now
taken as a seal of legitimacy for Dayrit's new POC administration.
</P>
<P>
Philippine chief de mission to the SEA Games Sultan Jamalul
Kiram went to Brunei last weekend to secure the official
invitation, the same document which the SEA Games Federation
issued to ousted POC president Cristy Ramos last March 8.
</P>
<P>
"We have to provide our own accreditation because it seems
Cristy won't give to us the first official invitation issued by
the SEA Games Federation. At least we are now officially
accredited," Dayrit said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Dayrit assumed as POC president early this month using a
temporary office after the International Olympic Committee
recognized the extraordinary general assembly meeting last May 10
where Ramos was ousted through a majority vote of no confidence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kiram said that host Brunei is doing well in its
preparation for the regional biennial event which will be held in
this tiny but oil-rich country for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to reports that participating athletes and officials
from 12 countries will find difficulty in booking hotel
accommodations, Kiram said Brunei has constructed 7-story and 350-
room building for each country not to mention the 3,000-seater
dining hall for the delegates.
</P>
<P>
Some 250 Filipino athletes will be competing in 19 of the 22
sports calendared in this year biennial event on August 7-15.

<HEADLINE> UK, Russia to Strengthen Ties After Kosovo: Cook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 21 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said Monday that his Russian counterpart Igor Ivanov would
visit Britain next month to help strengthen ties between the two
nations.
</P>
<P>
"I can confirm that (Ivanov) has agreed to my invitation to
visit Britain next month as my personal guest, and we will explore
how to strengthen Britain and Russian relations," Cook told a
London news conference via a live video-link from Luxembourg,
where he was attending a General Affairs Council held by foreign
ministers of the European Union nations.
</P>
<P>
"The (peacekeeping agreement) reached with Russia gives us a
sound basis on which to provide the peacekeeping of Kosovo," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Russia and the NATO Western allies were badly
strained during the conflict in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Russia opposed NATO's airstrike campaign and later sent troops
into the provincial capital of Pristina ahead of NATO, a move that
surprised and exasperated the alliance.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 21 (Xinhua) -- This east China metropolis has
announced several measures to build itself into an economic center
for both the country and the Asian-Pacific area within a decade.
</P>
<P>
It will continue its endeavors to upgrade its industrial
development through fostering the information technology,
biopharmaceuticals, new materials and service industry sectors,
including financial and insurance services, said Mayor Xu Kuangdi.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at an investment forum here today, which
was sponsored by the British magazine ``The Economist."
</P>
<P>
"In order to play a greater role in the overall development of
China in the future, Shanghai should lay firm foundation for
building itself into a regional economic center," he said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of technological innovation, Xu said
that universities and research institutes will be closely
amalgamated with enterprises, so that new research findings can be
applied to industry more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, Shanghai is carrying out a new round of
infrastructure construction, which includes a new international
airport in the Pudong New Area, a deep-water container port and a
project aimed at improving the local information network.
</P>
<P>
Xu also announced that transnational corporations will be
encouraged to open their regional headquarters in Shanghai,
promising that the procedures for approving foreign investment
projects will be further simplified.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) and the
United States are going to assume "world-wide responsibility" and
form a "Partnership for a new century," said their joint statement
issued here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The EU-US summit in Bonn, attended by U.S. President Bill
Clinton, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, and acting European
Commission President Jacques Santer, was focused on funding the
Balkan reconstruction, and defusing the US-EU trade conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The EU and the United States will follow the Kosovo model of co-
operation, while coping with challenges such as cross-border
threats and regional instability, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The two also agreed on the principle and mechanism of an "early
warning system" to prevent possible regional arguments and
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The statement acknowledged the role of the United Nations in
preventing and managing the international crises. "We fully
recognize the uppermost responsibility of the U.N. Security
Council in maintaining international peace and security," it read.
</P>
<P>
The US and EU said that NATO remained the central element of
the so-called "trans-Atlantic security". They agreed to improve
Europe's capability of crisis management and to strengthen the "
European pillar of the NATO," namely the West European Union (WEU).
</P>
<P>
The WEU, a bloc including 10 European NATO members, is due to
merge with the EU in the year 2002 to make up the military section
of the EU.
</P>
<P>
On global trade issues, the statement said the World Trade
Organization (WTO) should become more open, more transparent, and
more accessible. It will be the theme for the new world trade
round scheduled for the year 2000, it said.

<HEADLINE> Filipino Driver Eyes Honors at Asian Formula 2000 in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Champion driver Richard Joson hopes
to achieve no other Filipino has done before when he represents
the country in the third and fourth rounds of the Asian Formula
2000 to be held on June 27 at the Zhuhai Circuit in China.
</P>
<P>
Joson is the lone Filipino among the 17 top world-caliber
drivers competing in the event.
</P>
<P>
Barring all mechanical problems, Joson is quite optimistic of
his chances, the Philippines News Agency (PNA) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"My only problem is to get familiar with this challenging
Chinese racetrack. With the team behind me 100 percent and the
Formula 2000 experience in the last race, I believe it would be
much easier this time," Joson was quoted by PNA as saying.
</P>
<P>
Joson showed class in the first race on May 23 at the Subic
International Raceway where he was running third during the first
few laps until gearbox problems blew up chances of bagging the leg
crown.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Beats Draper to Advance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Top men's seed Pete Sampras of the
United States opened his Wimbledon defence on Monday by breezing
past Australian Scott Draper 6-3, 6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, bidding for a sixth title here which would see him
overtake Swedish legend Bjorn Borg's Open era tally of five and
match the all-time men's Grand Slam haul of 12 by Australian Roy
Emerson, looked in superb form at home on the lush turf of the
Center Court.
</P>
<P>
Draper, the 1998 winner at Queen's Club where Sampras triumphed
10 days ago, could never find his rhythm and Sampras gained the
all-important break in the seventh game of the third set with a
stunning backhand service return winner.
</P>
<P>
The American then served out for the most routine of victories,
securing his win in a little under one and a half hours on his
first match point with a volley.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Supports G-8 Statement on Cyprus Issue: Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus Kenneth
Brill Monday expressed the U.S. support for the statement on
Cyprus adopted by the G-8 summit in Cologne, Germany.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting with Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides, Brill said the statement underscores the interest of
the leading countries of the world to resume a comprehensive
negotiating process on the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Brill said the U.S. endorses this, adding that "we look
forward to moving forward."
</P>
<P>
At the Cologne summit which ended Sunday, the G-8 urged
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to invite both sides in Cyprus
for talks this autumn, noting that such negotiations should take
full consideration of relevant U.N. resolutions and treaties on
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
They also called on leaders of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
sides to commit themselves to negotiating without preconditions on
all issues and to commit themselves to negotiations until a
settlement is reached.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation, but so far no
tangible results have been achieved.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Since it started operation a
year ago, the Hong Kong international airport has settled into a
routine of efficiency and is playing an important role in Hong
Kong's economic development and its continued prosperity.
</P>
<P>
In his first meeting with the media here Monday, Airport
Authority Chairman Victor Fung said that at the airport alone,
businesses are employing some 45,000 people and thousands more are
employed in downstream services such as hospitality, retailing and
other businesses.
</P>
<P>
Tourism income in 1998 amounted to 55.2 billion HK dollars, he
said, adding that total visitors for 1999 will reach 10 million
and total income will rise by 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Between its opening last July and the end of May this year, the
airport handled a total of 26.7 million arrivals and departures, 4.
8 percent more than the same period of the previous year, said
Fung, who took up his post earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
With the best facilities in the world, the airport now has an
average of 450 flights, 90,000 arrivals and departures and more
than 4,500 tons of cargo every day.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 60 airlines operating some 3,000 flights
between Hong Kong and 110 cities around the world. There are
direct flights from Hong Kong to nearly 40 inland cities and
demand for aviation services is growing, he said.
</P>
<P>
The latest surveys conducted by the airport show that more than
90 percent of the passengers are satisfied with the airport
services.
</P>
<P>
However, there's still room for improvement, he said, pledging
that the airport will do its best to enhance the overall services
to meet the increasing demand.

National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, met here
today with Cambodian National Assembly President Norodom Ranarith.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that, under the leadership of King Norodom Sihanouk,
Cambodia has smoothly realized ethnic reconciliation. China is

Assembly and government, the two major parties, out of concern for
the overall interests of the country and the nation, have engaged
in cooperation, and made new progress in both domestic and foreign
affairs, he added.
</P>
<P>
China highly appreciates King Sihanouk's unique and important
role in safeguarding national stability, realizing ethnic
reconciliation and speeding up economic growth, Li said.

He said that the new Cambodian government mapped out its
political guiding principles based on the consensus between the
two parties, and this accords with the practical situation of the
country and the basic interests of its people.
</P>
<P>
China, as a close neighbor of Cambodia, sincerely hopes that
the Cambodian people, under the leadership of King Sihanouk, will
take an ethnically harmonious, politically stable and economically
developing Cambodia into the next century, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the NPC, Chinese government and people all harbor

<HEADLINE> India Suffers "Diplomatic Setback" on Kashmir: Pak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has been seeing a "most
serious diplomatic setback" for its arch-rival India as a G-8
statement urged India to resume dialogue with Pakistan on the
Kashmir crisis.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news briefing here Monday, spokesman for the
Pakistani Foreign Office Rafiq Altaf said India has suffered its
most serious diplomatic setback as its efforts for endorsement of
its stand by the Group of Eight countries (G-8) have been
rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, India has also explained the G-8 statement as
favorable to itself as the statement called for an end to
"infiltration" in the disputed area of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
India blamed Pakistan for the so-called "infiltrators" in the
Kargil sector near the Line of Control (LoC), which was denied by
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
According to Altaf, India was "begging" the international
community, particularly the G-8, to endorse India's continued
military action against the Mujahideen and reject recourse to
dialogue and peaceful negotiations as suggested by Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"The international community has seen through India's antics,"
said the spokesman, adding, "The G-8, instead, categorically
upheld Pakistan's position that the hostilities in Kashmir should
be halted, the Line of Control (LoC) mutually respected and the
dialogue resumed for a peaceful solution."
</P>
<P>
The G-8 said, "Any military action to change the status quo is
irresponsible," Altaf noted, stressing that Pakistan is not trying
to change the LoC.
</P>
<P>
He went on to blame India for its violations of the LoC in
Chorbat La in 1972, Siachen in 1984 and Qamar in 1988 and its
current artillery ground attacks against Pakistan posts along the
LoC and its "aerial incursions."

Ranarith said China has always offered great help to Cambodia,
and China's assistance has been very useful to his country,
directly helping the people in its poverty-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
He said that his delegation includes members of three major
political parties, this shows not only the spirit of ethnic
reconciliation and unity, but also the unanimity on developing
relations with China among all parties.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Overseas investment has kept a
steady momentum in this east China metropolis, and is showing
signs of increasing. This is the result of special efforts made by
the Shanghai municipal government, said Zhu Xiaoming, head of the
Shanghai Municipal Foreign Trade and Economic Commission, here
today.
</P>
<P>
In the January-May period, Shanghai approved 585 overseas-
invested projects, up 28.3 percent compared with the same period
of last year. Overseas-invested enterprises exported 3.85 billion
U.S. dollars-worth of goods, up 34.96 percent, and the service
industry attracted 1.06 billion U.S. dollars in foreign investment,
accounting for 60.5 percent of the total foreign investment the
city attracted, up 35 percent compared to the same period of the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Investment from the United States and Hong Kong was up; about
95 U.S.-invested projects were set up in Shanghai in the first
five months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-invested enterprises tended to re-invest, Zhu noted,
and more overseas investors want to run their enterprises in
Shanghai themselves.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that Shanghai aims to attract four billion U.S.
dollars in overseas investment this year, channel overseas
investment to high-tech industry, and encourage overseas investors
to cooperate with private and non-state enterprises.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Eight experts from Latin America
said here today that trade between that continent and China should
go beyond mere exchanges of raw materials and primary products.
</P>
<P>
They made the remark here today at an economic and trade
seminar between China and Latin America, including the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that a delegation of officials from
several Latin American countries had explained to the Chinese
people the overall economic situation in Latin America and the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
Juan Carlos Moneta, permanent secretary of the Latin American
Economic System (also known as SELA), said Latin America had
experienced economic recovery before being deeply influenced by
the global financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
SELA, which co-hosted the seminar together with the China
Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), is a
consultation and coordination group made up of 28 Latin American
and Caribbean countries.
</P>
<P>
Now the economies of the continent are opening to the rest of
the world, he said. Therefore, China and Latin America should
grasp the opportunity to further develop bilateral trade, he added.

Eugenio Anguiano, a former Mexican ambassador to China, said
agricultural production is very efficient in Latin America, and
thus the two sides can cooperate in this field as well as in the
textile industry.
</P>
<P>
Chinese enterprises have started making household electronic
appliances in Latin-America. They are engaged in forestry in
Brazil and build motor vehicles in Argentina, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides can cooperate in more fields with the increasing
of mutual understanding, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Compared with their respective strengths in the world economy,
China and Latin America do very little trade with each other, said
Jose Bekinschein, who is a special advisor to the Argentinian
government on the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
China's trade with Latin America was a mere 8.3 billion U.S.
dollars-worth in 1998, he said, as Latin America does most of its
business with Europe and North America. Trade with China is only
in the embryo stage, he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, there are frequent visits of commercial delegations
between the two sides, a lot of economic agreements have been
signed, and bilateral investments had been increased. He said he
was confident about trade between China and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
The seminar will continue tomorrow, when the Latin American
region's trade laws will be introduced.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Greece and Cyprus welcomed a G-8
decision made in Cologne on Monday that may -- based on U.N.
Security Council resolutions and international laws -- help solve
the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after their talks in Athens, Greek Defense Minister
Akis Tsohatzopoulos and his visiting Cypriot counterpart Yannakis
Chryssostomis described the G-8 decision on Cyprus as "positive."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. decision will invite both sides in Cyprus to hold
talks this autumn. It will also encourage the two sides to
continue their negotiations without preconditions until a
settlement is reached.
</P>
<P>
While complaining that two sets of standards have been applied
in Cyprus for the past 25 years, Tsohatzopoulos said that any
agreement signed by Greece and Cyprus would require a balanced
joint defense doctrine between the two countries.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) and the
United States are going to assume "world-wide responsibility" and
form a "Partnership for a new century," said their joint statement
issued here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The EU-US summit in Bonn, attended by U.S. President Bill
Clinton, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, and acting European
Commission President Jacques Santer, was focused on funding the
Balkan reconstruction, and defusing the US-EU trade conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The EU and the United States will follow the Kosovo model of co-
operation, while coping with challenges such as cross-border
threats and regional instability, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The two also agreed on the principle and mechanism of an "early
warning system" to prevent possible regional arguments and
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The statement acknowledged the role of the United Nations in
preventing and managing the international crises. "We fully
recognize the uppermost responsibility of the U.N. Security
Council in maintaining international peace and security," it read.
</P>
<P>
The US and EU, said NATO, remain the central element of the so-
called "trans-Atlantic security." They agreed to improve Europe's
capability of crisis management and to strengthen the "European
pillar of the NATO," namely the West European Union (WEU).
</P>
<P>
The WEU, a bloc including 10 European NATO members, is due to
merge with the EU in the year 2002 to make up the military section
of the EU.
</P>
<P>
On global trade issues, the statement said the World Trade
Organization (WTO) should become more open, more transparent, and
more accessible. It will be the theme for the new world trade
round scheduled for the year 2000, it said.

<HEADLINE> Poll Voices Concerns for Canada's "Internet Kids" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- With a booming generation of "
Internet kids" emerging in Canada, voices are being raised
challenging the validity of the educational system to provide "
reading and writing fundamentals."
</P>
<P>
A majority of Canadians say that too much emphasis is being
placed on computers in the classroom, a report by the "Globe and
Mail" newspaper said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Citing a national education poll conducted in May, the report
said that 56 percent of 1,115 Canadians in the survey felt
students were spending too much class time on computers.
</P>
<P>
The poll uncovered serious reservations about the reading and
writing abilities of today's high-school graduates, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Only 34 percent of those surveyed held the view that "today's
high school graduates have solid reading and writing skills,"
while 65 percent disagreed.
</P>
<P>
"Computers are not going to go away. However, I think the data
tells us that finding the right balance, making sure students are
well-grounded in the fundamentals, is important," said John Write,
Vice-president of the Angus Reid Group which launched the poll.
</P>
<P>
One-third of Canadian households have been hooked up with the
Internet since it entered the life of Canadians 10 years ago,
according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Somali Faction Men Flee for Fear of Ethiopian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 21 (Xinhua)-- The pressure and the foreign
involvement in Somalia's internal affairs are increasing by the
day as the Ethiopian- Eritrean war continues along their borders.
</P>
<P>
Threats of more Ethiopian advances towards the regional capital
of Lower Shabelle, the port town of Merca, 100 kilometers south
of Mogadishu and the town of Qoryoley, are being envisaged as mass
exodus of refugees had already begun in several towns in the
region.
</P>
<P>
According to some of the refugees reaching here in Mogadishu,
the fear has especially increased after the Ethiopia-backed
Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA) fighters have captured Baidoa
town, an important point in southern Somalia, early in the month
and enlarged their sphere of control to Bur Hakaba Town
afterwards.
</P>
<P>
The fleeing people reaching here in Mogadishu who are mainly
the supporters of faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid, said they
have arrived from Qoryoleh, about 65 kms Southwest of the
capital, where the Oromo ethnic Ethiopians were allegedly given
the military base after they descended from a mysterious ship
that docked in the port town of Merca on May 4 this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the district commissioner of Qoryoley Town, Ali
Hussein Aliyow Ibrow, has denied that the people of the town are
fleeing their houses in fear of a possible Ethiopian incursion.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Ibrow said there are some individuals who left the
town on what he called their own wills.
</P>
<P>
In another development, 21 local organizations called The
peace &AMP; Human Rights Network, issued a communique Monday after
holding an unusual emergency session in south Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
In their communique, the peace network has expressed concern
over the mass infusion of weapons and illegal bank notes into
Somalia which they said are further aggravating the already
volatile situation of the horn of African country.
</P>
<P>
The communique has condemned both Ethiopia and Eritrea for
their direct involvement into Somalia's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The peace Network has also asked the Somali faction leaders not
to assist those countries in their endeavor of making Somalia a
battlefield for their differences.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian and Canadian companies that assisted some Somalis in
printing the illegal bank notes are also condemned for causing a
horrible inflation devastating the poor economy of Somalia.

<HEADLINE> HK Government to Finance 64 Industrial Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government will
use its Industrial Support Fund to finance 64 projects approved by
the Industry and Technology Development Council (ITDC) this
financial year, according to ITDC Secretary Annie Choi.
</P>
<P>
The fund, established in 1994 and provided on a yearly basis,
aims to support projects that can contribute to Hong Kong's
industrial or technology development. A total of 374 projects have
been supported in the last five financial years.
</P>
<P>
The objectives of the successful projects this year could be
broadly categorized as infrastructure support, development of new
technologies or products, personnel training and promotional
activities such as industry or technology conferences.
</P>
<P>
Of the 64 approved applications, 50 have already secured
industrial sponsorship either in cash or in kind, Choi said.
</P>
<P>
The total project costs amount to some 282.3 million HK dollars
(about 36.19 million U.S. dollars), to be used over five years, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Of these successful applications, 33 are from higher education
institutions, 14 from industrial support bodies, 16 from trade and
industrial organizations and one from a research institute, Choi
said.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Urges West to Correct Stances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei Monday reiterated Iran's adherence to Islamic
principles and urged the western countries to correct their
stance toward Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran will never try to justify its Islamic stands and
principles in dealing with the west, it is the westerners that
must correct their wrong stances, he said.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Speaker of Sudanese National
Assembly Hassan al Turabi, Khamenei said that in its relations
with other countries, Iran will consider mutual interests and
counter all arrogant tendencies.
</P>
<P>
He cited materialization of the Islamic rule and opposition to
arrogance as two features of Islamic sovereignty, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The reason for all the hostilities of the global arrogance
toward Iran and Sudan is because the two states practice Islam, he
said, stressing that showing leniency and trying to draw the
temporary consent of the arrogant powers will not remove these
hostilities.
</P>
<P>
The arrogant powers will not be happy with anything less
than full dominance and this is something that the Islamic
Republic of Iran will never accept, he said.
</P>
<P>
Turabi is currently in Iran for a two-day founding conference
of the Parliamentary Union of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference, which ended on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Chairman Meets Norodom Ranarith </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua)-- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), met with Norodom Ranarith, president of the
National Assembly of Cambodia, here today.
</P>
<P>
Li said China and Cambodia are close neighbors, and enjoy a
tradition of friendly relations. Since the establishment of the
People's Republic of China in 1949, friendship between the two
countries has progressed on a sustainable basis, withstanding the
test of time, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people will never forget the strong support
extended to China by King Norodom Sihanouk and the Cambodian
government on many important issues, he added.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that the third generation of the Chinese leadership,
with President Jiang Zemin at the core, will continue to promote
the friendly cooperation between the two countries, proceeding
from the existing solid basis.
</P>
<P>
He said Cambodia boasts rich natural resources and a fine
climate, and the Cambodian people, after years of war, cherish
peace and stability all the more, and are especially longing for
development and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that, under the leadership of King
Sihanouk, Cambodia will successfully achieve its goals, including
reconstruction, developing its economy and improving its living
standards.
</P>
<P>
Ranarith said that the friendship between Cambodia and China
was established by the leaders of the older generation, and so, as
their successors, the present leadership generation is responsible
for continuing such friendship.
</P>
<P>
On his current trip, Ranarith said, he aims to reinforce
cooperation between the two countries as well as the two
parliaments; at the same time, he intends to examine the
tremendous achievements made by the Chinese people in reform and
opening up.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Cambodian government, Ranarith thanked the
Chinese government for its consistent assistance, both political
and economic. He said that the domestic situation of Cambodia is
now turning toward stability, and the economic reconstruction work
has also returned to the normal track. He expressed the hope that
the two countries would further expand mutually-beneficial
cooperation in the economic and trade sector.
</P>
<P>
Ranarith is on a official goodwill visit at the invitation of
Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of China's National
People's Congress.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong EFIL to Launch Unit Trust Product </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Exchange Fund
Investment Limited (EFIL) announced here Monday to launch a unit
trust product tracking the Hang Seng Index as a means of its
shares disposal program.
</P>
<P>
However, the EFIL declined to give the details and timing of
the launch, since more preparatory work is needed before the
details are finalized, said Ti-liang Yang, chairman of the EFIL,
in a press briefing after an EFIL Board meeting Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Yang said the primary objective of the EFIL remains the
disposal of the shares in Hong Kong equity portfolio in an orderly
manner without disrupting the market.
</P>
<P>
"Having considered various methods of disposal, the Board has
concluded that it would be appropriate to launch the disposal
program in the form of a unit trust product tracking the Hang Seng
Index," he noted.
</P>
<P>
At this stage, the EFIL would recommend for an application to
be made for this unit trust product to be listed on the Stock
Exchange of Hong Kong, Yang said, adding that the minimum
denomination of the units would be of a size that would facilitate
participation by the retail public in the region.
</P>
<P>
Yang also outlined a number of advantages of the unit trust
approach in comparison to other disposal methods.
</P>
<P>
"It can cater for the needs of both retail and institutional
investors, but does not involve the selection of individual stocks
and is therefore 'market neutral,' while it offers the prospect of
the least disruption to the market," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yang revealed that at least four to five months is needed to
complete the preparatory work such as market research, government
approval and market promotion.
</P>
<P>
"Quite apart from getting ready in terms of documentation and
procedures, the decision to launch this unit product and the
timing of the launch will depend on the prevailing market
conditions," he added.

of 1998.

<P>
Government consumption expenditure in national account terms
grew by 4.4 percent in real terms in the first quarter of 1999,
compared with a 2.5 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
On visible trade, total exports of goods fell by 4.8 percent in
real terms in the first quarter of 1999, considerably smaller than
the 9.6 percent decrease in the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Imports of goods fell by 10.3 percent in real terms in the
first quarter of 1999, also smaller than the 13.5 percent decline
in the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
On invisible trade, exports of services resumed a positive
growth of 1.4 percent in real terms in the first quarter of 1999,
compared with a 0.2 percent decline in the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports of services recorded a marginal decrease of
0.2 percent in real terms in the first quarter of 1999, having
fallen by 2.0 percent in the preceding quarter.
</P>
<P>
A Government Secretariat spokesman noted that the rate of
decline in GDP, in terms of both the year-on-year and seasonally
adjusted quarter to quarter comparisons, had moderated
considerably in the first quarter of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Senate to Resume Debate on Nominees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's senate has received the
curricula vitaes of some minister nominees and is expected to
resume its debate on the cabinet nominees Tuesday, said This Day,
a major Nigerian daily Monday.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of the vitaes and other relevant information as
are required by the senate will enable the committee of the whole
house to raise questions on the antecedents, experience and
characters of the nominees.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted sources close to the Senate as saying that
 President Olusegun Obasanjo was "determined to ensure that none
of the nominees is rejected at the end of the Senate screening."
</P>
<P>
The 109-member senate asked the president to provide them with
more information barely hours after it kicking off the screening
process on June 16.
</P>
<P>
Only five candidates so far on the nomination list have been
accepted by the senate while others are pending on further
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
But the delayed screening process is already under severe
criticism, as some senators have been accused of accepting bribe
offers, said This Day.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, Senator Gbenga Aluko described lately
in Abuja that the situation necessitate his pushing for a motion
Tuesday asking the senate to disqualify any nominee found to have
offered monetary or material inducements to senators.
</P>
<P>
"It will be easy to point out ulterior reasons when a nominee
offers money to be cleared. The implications of such an act could
be that such a nominee does not really want to serve, but has the
intention of using his position to line his pocket." said Senator
Aluko.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Malaysian Navy
(RMN) and the Republic of Singapore Navy are expected to resume
their joint exercise code-named Malapura, RMN Chief Vice Admiral
Abu Bakar Abdul Jamal said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Abu Bakar said the exercise, supposed to be held annually, has
not been held since 1997 due to the regional economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
Malapura, first held in 1984, was aimed at developing better
understanding and working relationship between the two navies
through the practice of common procedures and naval techniques.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully we can continue with the exercise now that we have
come out of the economic downturn," Abu Bakar told reporters after
receiving his Singapore counterpart, Rear Admiral Richard Lim
Cherng Yih at the Ministry of Defense here.
</P>
<P>
Lim, who is due to retire at the end of this month, arrived
here Monday for a two-day visit. He also called on Armed Forces
Chief General Tan Sri Mohd Zahidi Zainuddin and Defense Minister
Abang Abu Bakar Mustapha.
</P>
<P>
Abu Bakar said the two navies have enjoyed good relations.
</P>
<P>
On multilateral cooperation, Abu Bakar said both countries
would take part in the Stardex exercise to be held in September
under the auspices of the Five-Power Defense Arrangement which
also involves Australia, Britain and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Abu Bakar also said he expects the RMN to receive its two
frigates currently undergoing trials in Britain before the
Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace Exhibition to be
held from November 30 to December 5.

<HEADLINE> Journalist Arrested for Genocide in Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 21(Xinhua) -- Rwandan government claimed to have
arrested a woman journalist with the infamous Radio Television
Libre des Milles Collines (RTLM) which played a prominent role in
inciting Hutus to exterminate Tutsis during the 1994 genocide.
</P>
<P>
''Valerie Bemeriki was arrested in northwestern Rwanda late
last week and will be prosecuted for genocide and crimes against
humanity,'' Rwandan judicial officials announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Bemeriki is most sadly recalled for her incitation to the
mass-killings of Tutsis and opposition Hutus in April - July 1994
on the infamous RTLM, the Rwandan News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Bemeriki is on the list of the more than 1,000 most-wanted
genocide criminals, made by the Rwandan government in 1996, who
are said to be planners, executioners, and ring-leaders of the
mass-killings.
</P>
<P>
The RTLM was created in mid-1993 as a private radio, but its
main share- holders were members of the family of President
Juvenal Habyarimana who wanted an instrument that could help
destroy the Arusha Peace Accord signed by the government and the
armed opposition of the Rwandan Patriotic Front.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong police are
investigating a pitch invasion incident between Nepalese fans and
Malaysian players on Sunday, according to a government press
release here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The match was one of the Asian Group Six matches for the 2000
Olympic Qualification tournament.
</P>
<P>
One coach and three players of the Malaysian team were injured
in the incident and were treated and discharged from hospital.
</P>
<P>
The match, which was stopped two minutes before the final
whistle, was at one-all before the brawl happened.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said police began reinforcing at the stadium
when the excitable mood of some of the Nepalese football fans was
first spotted by the police commander around eight minutes before
the pitch invasion.
</P>
<P>
"This did not succeed in preventing the pitch invasion when the
Nepal team scored due to the size of the invaders, around 200, and
the design of the stadium which allows easy access to the pitch
from the stand as a safety feature," said district commander Tsang
Wai-hung.
</P>
<P>
The assault incident lasted for around three minutes before
order was restored by police deployed at the stadium.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the case has been classified as assault
occasioning actual bodily harm. No arrest has been made so far and
investigations are continuing.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton on Sunday accused Republican
presidential front-runner George W. Bush of having little to say
on major issues such as gun control, and he predicted that Vice
President Al Gore will rise in the polls when voters start
demanding more details from candidates.
</P>
<P>
-- The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) formally
declared an end to its air offensive against Yugoslavia following
the departure of the last Yugoslav troops from Kosovo on Sunday,
as leaders of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations and
Russia announced a major effort to rebuild the war-battered
Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Republican Party has undergone a fundamental
repositioning and softening of its abortion stance in order to
boost its chances of reclaiming the White House. The move has
alarmed some conservatives and split the Republican Presidential
field, but most party leaders seem to view that as a more
palatable alternative than giving a Democrat the Presidency.
</P>
<P>
-- The last of some 40,000 Serbian forces left Kosovo a few
hours ahead of NATO's deadline for withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The Group of Seven nations proposed to reduce by up to 70
percent the 127 billion U.S. dollars in debt owed by 33 poor
countries, mostly in Africa, and endorsed ways of heading off
financial crises.
</P>
<P>
-- India's army is on a state of alert, with an estimated 30,
000 soldiers taking up positions along the Indian-Pakistani border.

<HEADLINE> Tai'an to Restore Historical Sites to Original Appearance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- In order to recapture the original
beauty of the centuries-old Dai Temple, the Tai'an municipal
government will remove several of its departments which at present
occupy a quarter of the temple site, located in the old city area
of Tai'an, one of the country's leading tourism destinations in
east China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
The Dai Temple, which was initially built in the Qin Dynasty (B.
C. 221-207) and then expanded in the Song Dynasty (960-1279), now
covers 96,500 sq m and is regarded as the largest ancient-
architecture garden preserved in Tai'an.
</P>
<P>
The temple, which is located at the foot of Mount Taishan, will
be one of a number of historical sites and scenic spots in the
city protected from the pollution and encroachment of modern urban
life.
</P>
<P>
This is because the local government is stepping up a sweeping
program to move all local government departments, administrative
organizations and part of the enterprises, as well as nearly one-
third of its citizens out of the old city area into newly-built
areas, to the west of the old quarter.
</P>
<P>
The new city areas will cover nearly 40 sq km, about two-thirds
of the old city areas. Construction work in the new areas is going
on smoothly, and the first new residential quarter has already
taken shape and is ready for use.
</P>
<P>
At a cost of 1.5 billion yuan, the local relocation program
began in February this year and is scheduled to last 3 to 5 years.
</P>
<P>
Tai'an, which is 67 km from this capital of Shandong Province,
has been boosting its local economy by making full use of its rich
tourism resources. It earned 2 billion yuan-worth of income from
tourism in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Mount Taishan alone attracts an average of 30,000 domestic and
overseas visitors every day. They come to view more than 20
ancient examples of architecture and hundreds of ancient stone
inscriptions located on the mountain, which was added to the World
Heritage list of culture and nature sites by UNESCO in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Close to the mountain are scattered a number of relic sites,
including the spot where the first human fossilized teeth were
found dating back 50,000 years. All these add to the attractions
of Tai'an, which generated 34.4 billion yuan in GDP in 1998.
</P>
<P>
A booming economy, together with the fast-growing number of
citizens in local urban areas have gradually cast shadows over the
old scenic city, as a result of skyscraper buildings, exhaust
emissions from automobiles, pollution, noise and dust.
</P>
<P>
However, with the growing of more greenery, the transformed old
city will become the cultural and tourism center of Tai'an, and is
expected to increase its income from tourism by 30 percent
annually during the first few years after the completion of the
relocation projects.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Denies Fighting over Weekend With Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROIBI, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Eritrea Monday denied any
fighting occurred on its border with Ethiopia over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean Foreign Ministry released the news following the
reports from Addis Ababa that Ethiopia had repelled new Eritrean
offensive over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The release reaching here Monday said that "there had been no
fighting since early last week when the Ethiopia ceased its
offensives after successive defeats."
</P>
<P>
"The accounts coming from Addis Ababa are, in keeping with
pattern, completely without basis and designed to mislead the
Ethiopian people," said Tesfamariam Tekeste, head of Asia and
Australia Desk at the foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea also denied Sunday a report from the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) that it had occupied territory of neighboring
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
In recent heavy border fighting, Ethiopia claimed that its army
had put 24,450 Eritrean troops out of action.
</P>
<P>
While Eritrea said its forces had downed four Mig-23 fighter
planes and one helicopter gun ship in the Ethiopian fleet, and
killed and wounded 18, 000 Ethiopian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The two Horn of African neighbors began their border conflicts
in May 1998. Although both sides agreed to the OAU peace
framework, there is still no sight for immediate resolution to the
one-year-long conflict.

ISLAMABAD, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE)
index closed higher Monday amid thin volume due to the uncertain
situation in Kashmir, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The KSE-100 index rose 13.96 points, or 1.32 percent, to
1,066.15 against 1,052.19 last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The total volume of trade on Monday stood at 64.387 million
shares against last Friday's 143.381 million shares.
</P>
<P>
"The market lacked direction and the uncertain political
situation in Kashmir is shying away the genuine investors who are
preferring to stay at sidelines," said Shakeel Anwar Kamal, a
dealer with Prudential Securities Pvt. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
He said the Group of Eight countries have also stressed the
need for holding talks on the Kashmir dispute as unless the
fundamentals are cleared, the genuine investors are not keen on
entering the market.
</P>
<P>
"There was little buying in blue chip stocks as the market
players found the present rates to be at attractive levels which
could help in booking profits if the situation (in Kashmir)
improves," said Imran Afzal, a dealer with Yusuf Ibrahim Brokerage
house.
</P>
<P>
The market is expected to dip in the coming session as long as
the situation in Kashmir remains tense and there is a war-like
situation, Afzal said.

<HEADLINE> Renovation of Tian'anmen Square Near Completion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The eight month long renovation of
the Tian'anmen Square in downtown Beijing is nearing completion
and on Sunday gardeners, aided by People's Liberation Army
soldiers, began to lay turf on two newly constructed lawns.
</P>
<P>
"They each cover an area of 4,800 square meters and will bring
the total green space in the square area up to nearly 14,000
square meters," said an official in charge of the renovation
project.
</P>
<P>
The renovation of Tian'anmen Square, which is reputed to be the
world's largest city square, started at the end of last October as
part of the preparations for the celebration of the 50th founding
anniversary of the People's Republic of China on October 1 this
year.
</P>
<P>
Employees of the Beijing City Gardening Administration and more
than 400 soldiers and officers from the PLA Beijing Garrison
started laying turf at around 7 a.m. Sunday, and the work is
expected to be completed before June 25.
</P>
<P>
"After that, the renovation project will soon be concluded and
the square will reopen to domestic and foreign visitors," said the
official.
</P>
<P>
According to Hou Yinglun, an official with the engineering
department of the Beijing City Gardening Administration, the grass
planted on the square grows very fast and can withstand cold
weather. It can thus coat the square in a green sward for some 300
days a year.

<HEADLINE> Panchen Lama Makes Pilgrimage to Resting Place of Predecessors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIGAZE, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The 11th Panchen Lama this morning
paid a pilgrimage to the soul towers of most of the late Panchen
lamas at the Zhaxi Lhumbo Lamasery, in Shigaze, the second largest
city in the Tibet Autonomous Region, southwest China.
</P>
<P>
During his pilgrimage, the 11th Panchen Lama, who is nine years
of age in earthly terms, swore to inherit and practice the will of
his predecessors and be a good living Buddha.
</P>
<P>
He started his pilgrimage in the Qamba Hall by making kowtows
and donating a hada (a white silk ribbon) to the statue of the
Qamba Buddha, the god of the future.
</P>
<P>
He then went to the hall housing the soul tower of the late
10th Panchen Lama, again practicing kowtows and making hada
donations while also reading sutras.
</P>
<P>
The 11th Panchen Lama also attended the hall accommodating the
soul tower of the 4th Panchen Lama and the hall that keeps the
soul towers of the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th Panchen lamas.
</P>
<P>
According to Tibetan Buddhist theory, the Panchen lamas are a
reincarnation of their previous souls and, therefore, the 11th
Panchen Lama is the reincarnation of the 10th.
</P>
<P>
The 11th Panchen Lama made the pilgrimages to the soul towers
of former Panchen lamas in order to inherit their will and to
display the power of the Buddha.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion of the pilgrimage, he said, "All the former
Panchen lamas were patriotic and loved the religion."
</P>
<P>
The 11th Panchen Lama pledged that he must inherit the will of
the late Panchen lamas, follow the instructions by President Jiang
Zemin, whose inscription for the Zhaxi Lhumbo Lamasery reads, "
Safeguard the nation and benefit the people."
</P>
<P>
He will work hard to educate himself in the Buddhist doctrine,
be widely engaged in charitable activities and become a good
living Buddha who is patriotic and also loves the religion, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Book on Japan's Invasion Tactics Found in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- A book in the original Japanese
outlining the preparations for Japan's invasion of China in the
1930s has recently been discovered in Harbin, northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
It has been preserved by a Chinese folk collector and was
written by a Japanese military officer named Heijio Uchida at the
Harbin garrison. Printed in April 1934, the yellow-stained book,
which is 19 cm by 13 cm, includes 23 military photographs and
maps in its 317 pages.
</P>
<P>
Da Zhigang, Assistant Professor in the Research Center of
Japanese Affairs of the Heilongjiang Social Sciences Academy, said
that the discovery is of great importance in the study of Japanese
intentions before its invasion of China in 1936, the Second World
War, and the modern military history.
</P>
<P>
The book also contains a Japanese analysis of the international
situation in 1936, the Far East Area in particular; comparing
military forces, strategic deployment, and the military
relationship between the previous Soviet Union, the United States
and Japan.
</P>
<P>
A detailed document of Japan's military and political policies
at that time, and the invasion of China and the Pacific War
thereafter, it confirmed that the book was obviously a reference
for Japan's military leaders.
</P>
<P>
Da said that there is considerable and specific data,
especially pictures which show explicitly that the Japanese had
made much preparation before taking action. This strongly refutes
the explanations and claims by a small group of Japanese right
wing people that " Japan was forced to declare war at that time."

<HEADLINE> Papua New Guinea to Buy Thai Rice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Thai rice may find its way to
Papua New Guinea (PNG), as the Pacific island state has expressed
interest in buying Thai rice, a senior official from the Thai
Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives Ministry said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Director-General of the Department of Agriculture Anant Dalodom
said negotiations in this regard between the two governments have
been progressed.
</P>
<P>
Ministers in charge of agricultural products in Papua New
Guinea had visited Thailand three times to discuss with their Thai
counterparts the possibility of purchasing Thai rice, Anant said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Papua New Guinea agreed to buy Thai rice provided
that the Thai Agriculture Ministry issues a certificate verifying
that the purchased rice is of high quality and disease and
insect-free.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 90 percent of the rice imported into Papua New
Guinea are from Australia, which convinced its neighbor that its
rice is of higher quality than that of others.
</P>
<P>
"Authorities from Papua New Guinea have learned by themselves
that Thai rice is of the highest quality, and has been very
popular in the international market," Anant said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the ministry is willing to issue the
certificate as required.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is the world's largest rice exporter, sharing 30
percent of the world market. The country exported 6.5 million tons
of rice in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Stresses Importance of Monitoring the Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Yellow River has been the
scene of frequent disasters over the past 2,500 years and dykes on
the lower reaches have been breached more than 1,500 times.
</P>
<P>
Now China's President Jiang Zemin has called for unremitting
efforts to control the floods of this mighty river, better use its
water resources and create a good ecological environment along its
length.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin made his remarks today in the capital of
central Henan Province and explained, "This has always been a
major task for the Chinese nation and is of great strategic
significance to the sustained socio-economic development along the
river and nationwide."
</P>
<P>
Jiang was addressing a forum on the topic attended by Vice-
Premier Wen Jiabao, leading officials from Henan and Shandong
provinces and high-ranking military officers.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the river has withstood floods since 1949,
when the People's Republic of China was founded, attributing that
success to the consistent efforts of the Chinese people in water
control under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of
China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang urged that further efforts be taken in exploring new ways
to control and develop the river from a long-term perspective.
</P>
<P>
"The general principle in this regard is to combine water
control, rational uses of water resources and the improvement of
the ecological environment together to seek a coordinated
development of the economy, population, resources and environment,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
He called for the strengthening of river dykes, the dredging
of the river course and prevention of soil from erosion by
applying modern technology to ensure the long-term safety of the
river.
</P>
<P>
Jiang asked local governments to be fully prepared for possible
flooding this year, stressing that one of the important
experiences learned in successfully combating last summer's
flooding of the Yangtze and Nenjiang rivers is the importance of
taking preventative measures.
</P>
<P>
He said that emergency personnel should be well-organized,
flood-fighting equipment stocked in advance and the army and local
people ready to increase their cooperation.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Trade Minister Shi
Guangsheng and visiting Minister for the Primary Industries of
Malaysia Lim Keng Yaik stressed here today that the two should
enhance bilateral trade through various means.
</P>
<P>
Shi told Lim that China is pleased to see the economic recovery
in Malaysia and is ready to make joint efforts with the Malaysian
side to step up bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
Lim said that Malaysia hopes to increase palm oil exports to
China since palm oil is the most important national product of his
country.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's exports of palm oil account for 24 percent at the
world market, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Lim also stressed Malaysia unconditionally supports China's
accession to the World Trade Organization at an early date.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese minister said that China hopes that while stressing
exports to China, the Malaysia side should also pay attention to
China's exports to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Shi said that China and Malaysia can conduct various forms of
cooperation, such as corn for palm oil or rice for palm oil barter
trade.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian minister arrived here on Sunday at the invitation
of Shi for a five-day official visit. He is expected to meet the
heads of several of China's ministerial departments.

<HEADLINE> Historical Sites To Recapture Original Appearance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- In order to recapture the original
beauty of a centuries-old Dai Temple, the Tai'an municipal
government departments, which occupy a quarter of its surrounding
area will be relocated from within the temple site, in the old
city areas of Tai'an, one of the country's leading tourist
destinations in east Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
The Dai Temple, which was initially built in the Qin Dynasty (B.
C. 221-207) and then expanded in the Song Dynasty (960-1279), now
covers 96,500 sq m and is regarded as the largest ancient-
architecture garden preserved in Tai'an.
</P>
<P>
The temple will be one of the historical sites and scenic spots
in the city, which is at the southern foot of the Taishan Mountain,
enabling it to recapture its original appearance.
</P>
<P>
This is because the local government is stepping up a sweeping
program to move all local government departments, administrative
organizations and enterprises, as well as nearly one-third of its
citizens out of the old city area into newly-built areas, to the
west of the old region.
</P>
<P>
The new city areas will cover nearly 40 sq km, about two-thirds
of the old city areas. Construction work in the new areas is going
on smoothly and the first new residential quarter has already
taken shape and is ready for use.
</P>
<P>
At a cost of 1.5 billion yuan, the local relocation program
began in February this year and is scheduled to last 3 to 5 years
and as many as 200,000 residents will be rehoused.
</P>
<P>
Tai'an, which is 67 km away from the capital of Jinan in
Shandong Province, has been boosting its local economy by making
full use of its rich tourism resources. It earned 2 billion yuan
worth of income from tourism in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the Taishan mountain alone, every day there are an
average of 30,000 domestic and overseas people who visit more than
20 ancient architectures and hundreds of ancient stone
inscriptions in the mountain, which was added to the World
Heritage list of culture and nature sites by UNESCO in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Close to the Taishan mountain are scattered a number of relic
sites, including the spot where the first human fossilized teeth
were found dating back 50,000 years. All these add to the
attractions of Tai'an, which generated 34.4 billion yuan in GDP in
1998.
</P>
<P>
A booming economic development together with the fast-growing
number of citizens in local urban areas have gradually cast
shadows over the old scenic city, as a result of skyscraper
buildings, exhaust emissions from automobiles, pollution, noise
and dust.
</P>
<P>
However, with the growing of more greenery, the transformed old
city will become the cultural and tourism center in Tai'an and is
expected to increase its income from tourism by 30 percent
annually during the first few years after the completion of the
relocation projects.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects West's Concern over Jews' Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran Monday rejected the concerns
expressed by western countries on the arrest of 13 Iranian Jews on
espionage charges.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Jews were nabbed on espionage charges and the
arrest had "nothing to do with their religion and beliefs,"
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in response to concerns expressed recently
by French and Canadian foreign ministers over the arrest of
Iranian Jews. The ministers also called for their release.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said that there was no ground whatsoever for the concern
voiced by certain countries, which "are being emboldened by
certain international circles."
</P>
<P>
"All those arrested are Iranian citizens and their trial on
charges of espionage with an aim to targeting Iran's national
security is an internal issue and the indisputable right of any
country," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the arrested people were charged with
operation against Iran's national security with the aid of foreign
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Any attempt to influence the trend of their fair trial will be
tantamount to interference in the internal affairs of the Islamic
Republic of Iran and rejected by all the legal decision-making
centers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Iran confirmed the arrest of 13 Iranian
Jews on charges of spying for Israel and the United States.
</P>
<P>
However, both Washington and Tel Aviv denied any links between
the Iranian Jews and the Israeli and U.S. intelligence services,
urging Tehran to release the Jews.
</P>
<P>
Some Iranian judicial officials have warned that the Iranian
Jews might face death sentences according to the Iranian law.

<HEADLINE> Obasanjo's Nomination Criticized for Biased to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some 42 members of the House of Representatives, mainly from
the northern part of the west African country, alleged on Thursday
that Obasanjo's actions since assuming his office on May 29
suggest plans to marginalize the north.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper The Punch Monday quoted presidency sources as
saying Sunday that Obasanjo and his team are unhappy and
uncomfortable with the criticisms and allegations.
</P>
<P>
Doyin Okupe, presidential adviser on media and publicity,
Friday expressed concern over the allegation of bias, describing
it as unfair and unfounded.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "just like the vice-president said, the
appointments were based on professional competence, rather than
ethnic or religious considerations."
</P>
<P>
Looking at the list of ministerial nominees, the adviser added,
"each state has at least a representative, there are 25 from the
North and 24 from the South."
</P>
<P>
Chief Maurice Ibekwe, member of the House of Representative,
described the current developments as "sad and worrisome."
</P>
<P>
He noted that "time has come when where you come from should
not be the basis for appointment, but competence, and Mr.
President is doing just that. "
</P>
<P>
National Vice-Chairman of the Alliance for Democracy (AD) in
the southwest Chief Ayo Fasanmi told the newspaper that there was
no basis for the antagonism of the president over his actions so
far.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo's anti-corruption crusade and other actions which are
geared towards ensuring equity deserved a commendation by all
Nigerians, Fasanmi stressed.

55 billion U.S. dollars), 3.691 billion HK dollars (473 million U.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Report Over Talks with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran Monday denied a report by an
Israeli newspaper that Iranian President Mohammad Khatami has
proposed secret dialogs with Israel on disarmament in order to
build confidence between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi strongly
dismissed the report as "baseless," the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli daily Haaretz reported Sunday that President
Khatami has proposed dialogs with Israel on signing of arms
control treaties as a first step toward confidence-building.
</P>
<P>
The daily said that Khatami asked British officials to convey
his message to Israel to remove distrust and suspicion between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian spokesman said that the propaganda ploys of the
Israeli mass media have proven "ineffective and worthless."
</P>
<P>
Misinformation campaign by the Israeli propaganda machine is
a futile attempt to mar the image of Iran, especially with
respect to recent achievements of President Khatami's
administration in the region and at international forums, he said.
</P>
<P>
Before the Islamic revolution in 1979, Israel enjoyed good
relations with the former Iranian shah regime.
</P>
<P>
But the two countries became arch foes after the Islamic
Republic of Iran rejected recognization of Israel and accused it of
usurping of the Arab land.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades, Iran deemed Israel as a major
threat to the regional security and stability while Israel
expressed concern over Iran's military development.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have run into new tensions over the recent
arrest of 13 Iranian Jews whom the Iranian authorities charged
with spying for Israel and the United States.
</P>
<P>
However, both Tel Aviv and Washington denied any link between
the Iranians and their intelligence services, urging Iran to
release the Iranian Jews.
</P>
<P>
Iranian authorities have rejected the concerns expressed by
western countries over the arrest, and claimed that the Iranian
Jews might be sentenced to death for spying.

<P>
BELGRADE, June 21 (Xinhua) -- NATO and the Kosovo Liberation
Army (KLA) signed an agreement early Monday on the
demilitarization of the guerrilla group in a bid to prevent
possible ethnic clashes.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached between Mike Jackson, commander of
the peacekeeping force in Kosovo, and the KLA leader, Hashim Thaci,
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The alliance peacekeepers would begin taking over the KLA's
arms from early Monday as both sides agreed that the agreement
took effect as of signing.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the KLA must stop all military activities,
including laying mines, putting up roadblocks as well as attacking
and abducting civilians.
</P>
<P>
The KLA is asked to close all its positions, remove the
sentries set up along the roads and mark the location of mines
laid by itself within four days of the signing of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Within seven days from now on, the KLA must place all its
weapons under the supervision of the peacekeeping force, clear all
mines and withdraw all its troops from the positions.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the KLA is also ordered to turn over all its weapons
to the place designated by the peacekeeping force within 30 days
and the KLA members will be banned from wearing its uniforms or
any signs belonging to the guerrilla group in three months.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Little Possibility of Full-Scale War Between India, Pakistan: Advani </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Caretaker Home Minister L. K.
Advani said Monday that he saw little possibility of a full-scale
war between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the chances of escalation into a full-fledged
war between India and Pakistan, Advani in an exclusive interview
with Press Trust of India (PTI) here said that "because of
multiplicity of authorities in Pakistan, we cannot say there will
be no war."
</P>
<P>
Advani evaded a question whether India would go beyond the Line
of Control (LOC) in Kashmir between India and Pakistan in the
ongoing fighting to stop logistical support to the intruders in
Kargil sector of Kashmir. The earlier local media reports said
that India had heavily shelled the Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (POK)
areas to cut off the supply lines of the intruders.
</P>
<P>
Indian former army chief general (RETD) Shankar Roychowdhury
has said that it is an impractical proposition for the army to
flush out the intruders without crossing the LOC.
</P>
<P>
India launched a big military operation from early May to
"flush out Pakistan-backed infiltrators" from the Kargil sector
and India refused to hold talks with Pakistan before it completes
its military operation in that area.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has warned India that many
more Kargil-like situations might crop up if the overall Kashmir
issue is not settled once and for all.
</P>
<P>
Advani said that it would be a limited war as invasion had been
contained and it was a matter of time before it would be foiled.

<HEADLINE> Announcement of Indonesia's Election Vote Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's General Election
Commission (KPU) on Monday requested that the announcement of the
final vote count be postponed, pending the settlement of all
election violations.
</P>
<P>
"The KPU had asked for the postponement so all (election)
violations could be settled first," Chairman of the Indonesian
Election Committee (PPI) Jakob Tobing said following a meeting
among members of the PPI and election monitoring committees and
leaders of political parties.
</P>
<P>
According to schedule, the PPI would announce the final vote
count at national level on Monday (June 21).
</P>
<P>
Tobing said the KPU will meet on Tuesday to decide when the
final vote count will begin.
</P>
<P>
Besides the election violations conducted by some parties in
several areas, the vote count in some provinces, such as Aceh has
not completed, Tobing said.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, the PPI has been ready to begin the final vote count
gradually because not all provincial election committees have
completed their tallies," he added.
</P>
<P>
KPU Chairman Rudini meanwhile said the final vote count could
only begin after all tabulations and other substantial data
reprocessed.
</P>
<P>
KPU is estimated to conclude its final vote count before July
8.
</P>
<P>
According to official Antara News Agency, about 78.29 percent
out of the 117,815,053 registered voters have been counted as of
01:00 p.m. local time on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The provisional results reported by Antara showed the
Indonesian Democratic party of Struggle (PDI-P) was still
front-runner, accounting for 34.13 percent of the total votes
counted, followed by ruling Golkar with 22.12 percent), the
National Awakening Party (PKB) 13.47 percent), the United
Development Party (PPP) 10.31 percent) and the National Mandate
Party (PAN) 6.97 percent.

<P>
Forty-eight political parties took part in the June 7 election

China's fiscal authorities announced on May 29 they would
reduce the stamp tax rate from 0.4 percent to 0.3 percent. On June
2, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) announced it
released control over the type of companies issuing B shares and
lifted restrictions on the number of companies issuing B shares
every year.
</P>
<P>
B shares are denominated in Renminbi and are traded on domestic
stock exchanges exclusively by foreign investors. A shares are
designed for Chinese nationals. Since 1991, 105 companies have
issued B shares on the Shenzhen and Shanghai stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
On June 9, the central bank announced further interest rate
cuts, which sent the market indexes on an upward spiral.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Mingli, a researcher from the Citic Securities Company,
said that the government's latest moves will increase the size of
the B-share market, by allowing private companies and foreign-
invested companies to issue B shares.
</P>
<P>
She added that the meager size of the market has failed to
attract enough foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
An official from the CSRC said that the commission is preparing
new measures to activate the B-share market, which will include
setting up of Sino-foreign investment funds, broadening the scope
of investors and improving the ways of issuing B shares.

<HEADLINE> Defending Champions Norway Defeat Russia 2-1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions Norway
started their World Cup road with a 2-1 victory over Russia in a
group c match at Boston.
</P>
<P>
The defending champions, hoping to win their second World Cup
title, were held by new-comers Russia for much of the match.
</P>
<P>
Yet Marianne Pettersen and Brit Sandaune were still too much for
the Russian defense line. They each had a goal and an assist to
give Norway the victory.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegians dominated the match from the very beginning. They
nearly opened the scoring at the first minute, but their first goal
didn't come until the 28th minute as Sandaune sent home a cross from
Pettersen.
</P>
<P>
Norway had lots of scoring chances after that but their second
goal came as late as at the 68th minute. Pettersen collected a
rebound and just shot past the Russian goal-keeper.
</P>
<P>
After the two goals, the Russian team tried to push forward and
their efforts were rewarded as Galina Komarova blasted home at the
78th minute.
</P>
<P>
The Russian coach Yurii Bystritzkii was quite satisfied with the
match:"We're already relatively happy since we can take part in the
World Cup. Now we're looking at our next two games and hope to get
into the second round."
</P>
<P>
The win put Norway on top of group c with three points. Japan
and Canada played to a 1-1 tie at San Jose on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Police Introduces Code of Conduct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean National Police
Agency on Monday announced a 12-point code of conduct for police
staff in a bid to eradicate corruption and establish discipline.
</P>
<P>
Under the new code of ethics, policemen are banned from
operating or taking part in management of bars, pubs, adult game
rooms, and other entertainment businesses.
</P>
<P>
The code also does not allow police to gamble, to drink alcohol
while on duty, and to drive under the influence of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
South Korean police officers have often been criticized for
receiving bribes from bars, night clubs, and other entertainment
businesses in red-light zones by abusing their power and peddling
their influence.
</P>
<P>
The police agency said that it will sternly punish those who
are found in violation of the code regardless of their rank and
record.
</P>
<P>
The new code of ethics came one week after the government
introduced a 10-point code of ethics for civil servants, which
banned them from receiving presents valued at or above 50,000 won
(some 40 dollars).

<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Group B seeded team Germany played
unconvincingly in their first match at the third women's World Cup and
had to settle for a 1-1 draw with Italy here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Germany dominated the match, especially in thye first half as
they out-shot their Italian opponents 9-3.
</P>
<P>
Italy had just one shot on goal in the first half and that was
enough for them to take a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
Assisted by Antonella Carta, Patrizia Panico beat the German
goal-keeper at the 36th minute to give Italy a surprising lead.
</P>
<P>
The German team played hard but their equalizer didn't come
until the 61st minute when they were awarded a penalty. Betina
Wegmann made no mistake from the spot.
</P>
<P>
Italian coach Carlo Facchin was happy with the result:"We are
satisfied with the one point. When we have more conviction of being
a team, that's when we will be a team."
</P>
<P>
Facchin's German counterpart Tina Theune-Meyer said:"We gave the
Italians too much space. Of course one point is not satisfying but
we were not putting it away."
</P>
<P>
Group B also includes Brazil and Mexico. Brazil now top the
group after trouncing Mexico 7-1 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Produces Cloned Embryo of Giant Panda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists announced today
that they have successfully developed an embryo of a giant panda
using clone technology, which could be a critical and exciting
breakthrough for saving an endangered species.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences explained that
they had introduced the cells of a dead female panda into the egg
cells of a Japanese white rabbit. They then spent 10 months
carefully nurturing the embryo, which was a year ahead of
expectations.
</P>
<P>
Chen Dayuan, a scientist from the academy's Animal Research
Institute, said that they are now trying to place the embryo in
the womb of a selected host animal which hopefully won't reject it.
If it works, they will possibly have created the world's first
cloned panda.
</P>
<P>
China recently announced plans to try and clone the giant panda
within three to five years, but Chen said that the scientists now
believe they can reach the goal in a shorter time.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda is unique to China and only around 1,000 now
live in the wild and 100 in zoos. Experts have warned that
extinction of the animal is imminent in a couple of dozen of years.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda has lived on the planet for eight million years
but it is the low reproduction rate that has led to drastic
reduction in the species. Artificial reproduction methods have
been tried in recent years but are not very effective.
</P>
<P>
The body cells the Chinese scientists used were from the bone
muscle, womb epidermis and mammary gland. Experiments showed that
the mammary cells achieved the best anastomosis with the egg cells
of the rabbit.
</P>
<P>
DNA analysis showed that the genetic characteristics of the
embryo are the same as that of the panda's somatic cell,
indicating that the cloned animal is without doubt a panda rather
than a rabbit.
</P>
<P>
American scientists have recently used the same method, known
as inter-species clone technology, to produce an embryo of the
rare argali. But an unfortunate abortion resulted in an unpleasant
ending of the experiment.
</P>
<P>
However, both the American and Chinese examples demonstrate
that the cloning of animals that are at the edge of extinction is
feasible, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, a British scientist successfully bred the world's
first cloned animal Dolly the sheep. The technique he used is
called intra-species cloning, with which the body cells and egg
cells are taken from the same animal species.
</P>
<P>
However, cells used in inter-species cloning are taken out from
different sorts of animals, and tend to be more difficult to
handle.
</P>
<P>
Biologists believe that intra-species cloning is not practical
in reproducing rare animals because their number is too small to
obtain eggs. Therefore, the research into inter-species cloning
should be stepped up.
</P>
<P>
The cloning of the giant panda was first proposed by Chen in
March 1997, and was then set as a leading program by the Chinese
Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Science and Technology.

Peng said that the magazine has opened discussions on the
philosophy of life for women and played an important role in
promoting their awakening and progress.
</P>
<P>
She said that the magazine also played an important role in
spreading knowledge on laws and regulations which can help women
protect their legal rights and get them out of difficulty.
</P>
<P>
"Women of China" was established in Yan'an in northwest China's
Shaanxi Province on June 1, 1939 to encourage women to participate
in the War of Resistance Against Japan (1937-1945).
</P>
<P>
"Thus, 'Women of China' has become an important part of the

rights of women and children in China and combat the gender
discrimination and other social misconceptions and misdeeds

in leading British newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Rejecting a French demand for an international food safety
agency, G8 set up instead two committees to collect the best
scientific evidence on whether genetically modified foods are safe.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- British Prime Minister Tony Blair Sunday used his most
lukewarm language yet on the prospects for Britain's entry into
the single currency. He indicated he would not join the pro-euro
campaign until the government decided to call a referendum.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Serb forces completed their withdrawal from Kosovo Sunday
allowing NATO formally to end air operations against Yugoslavia
and for the United Nations to launch the biggest peace-keeping
mission in its history.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- The major western powers and Russia struggled Sunday to
maintain a united front on ambitious and expensive postwar plans
for aid and reconstruction in the Balkans, with Britain sharply at
odds with its European partners over helping Yugoslavia while it
remains under the rule of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- NATO killed far more Serb civilians than soldiers during its

<HEADLINE> Silkworm Breeding Promotes Growth in North China's Ningxia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The silkworm-breeding business is
playing a more important role in the economic growth of North
China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The region has 20,000 mu (1,300 hectares) planted in mulberry
trees, 7,000 mu (470 hectares) of which was just added this year.
Seven years ago, only a few farmers in Ningxia raised silkworms, a
local source says.
</P>
<P>
Last year's silkworm cocoon output reached 230 tons, bringing 4.
6 million yuan to local farmers. The Ningxia silk has a better
quality than that of other parts of the country and costs 10 to 20
percent more on market, officials say.
</P>
<P>
The region has set up a large distribution center and a dozen
technological service centers for silkworm raisers. The Ministry
of Science and Technology and the China Silk Import and Export
Corporation have showed interest in turning the region into a
state-level high-quality silk center.

<HEADLINE> China Moves to Fight Locust Plague </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- China is intensifying its
fight against a looming severe plague of locusts this summer, with
23 million yuan already raised for the insect-killing drive.
</P>
<P>
The insects have been discovered in great density in nine
Chinese provinces and municipalities so far including Hebei,
Shandong, Henan, Tianjin and Shaanxi, affecting one and a half
times the area in previous normal years, according to the Ministry
of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged drought and high temperature since last winter
have resulted in the great numbers of locusts and increased swarm
densities.
</P>
<P>
"The locust density has reached as high as more than 3,000
insects per square meter, if the insects grow big enough ten-plus
days later, they could do great harm to crops, and wipe out crops
wherever they pass," said Zhang Shumin, a provincial agriculture
official in northern Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
He added the insect-killing program should be carried out right
now since most of the locusts are discovered in uncultivated land
and beaches and are not blighting crops for the present.
</P>
<P>
With the 23 million yuan of special funds for the insect-
killing program, China has purchased more than 1,200 tons of
pesticides, 100 tons of gasoline and 10,000 pesticide sprayers.
Provinces of Shandong and Hebei even rented seven airplanes for
the program.
</P>
<P>
Those infested areas also stepped up efforts to develop new
biological technologies to eradicate the insect.
</P>
<P>
China's earliest locust disasters date back more than 2,700
years. China has managed to reduce the locust-growing areas to
nearly 20 million mu (about 1.33 million hectares) from 60 million
mu (4 million hectares) in the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
According to the pledge of the Ministry of Agriculture, China
plans to take ten to 20 years to take the locust plague under
complete control by eradicating the insects in areas between 500,
000 and one million mu annually.

<HEADLINE> Manila Asks U.S. Bank to Give PAl More Time to Recover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has asked
the United States Export-Import Bank (Eximbank) to give Philippine
Airlines (PAL) more time to carry out its rehabilitation program
before taking the legal route against the debt-ridden company.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora issued this response Monday
to reports that the U.S. Eximbank has asked the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court to allow it to repossess PAL's loan-tied aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said in a news release that the Philippine government
have already written to the U.S. Eximbank, asking them to give a
little more consideration to the rehabilitation efforts of PAl.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is now up to PAl to oppose the reported move by
the U.S. Eximbank before the courts because the Philippine
government is no longer the proper party to act on this.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, the U.S. Eximbank asked the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court of Northern California on June 17 to lift a
restraining order barring legal action against PAl.
</P>
<P>
The reports also said this order covers the seizure of PAL
planes or property "anywhere in the U.S.".
</P>
<P>
Zamora said that if the U.S. court allows U.S. Eximbank to
repossess the planes, it would put a "very large crimp" on PAl's
rehabilitation process.
</P>
<P>
As prescribed by U.S. bankruptcy rules, a hearing on the
Eximbank motion is expected to be called at least 28 days after
PAL has been notified.
</P>
<P>
However, PAl officials said the flag carrier management has not
been formally notified of the new case.
</P>
<P>
PAL is now undergoing a rehabilitation program after its
chairman Lucio Tan infused 200 million U.S. dollars in fresh
capital into the airline on the June 4 deadline set by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, which is supervising PAL's
rehabilitation process.

<HEADLINE> Ho Chi Minh City's Export Value Up More than 10 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Ho Chi Minh City's total export
earnings in the first six months of this year are expected to
reach 2.05 billion u.s. dollars, an increase of 10.2 percent
compared to the same period of the last year, Vietnam's English
business newspaper The Saigon Times Daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the Ho Chi Minh City Statistics
Bureau, Local companies will account for 1.63 billion U.S.
dollars, a 5.8 percent increase, and the foreign-invested sector
413 million U.S. dollars, up 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
Industrial goods will remain the largest export income earner,
79.7 percent of the total, and up to 16.9 percent year-on-year.
Respective figures for seafood should be 5.9 percent and 2.9
percent, and for forestry products, 1.4 percent and 24 percent.
Agrofood, with a minus growth of 33.3 percent, will account for 13
percent of the total export value.
</P>
<P>
The City's import spending is expected to reach 1.73 billion
U.S. dollars, similar to that of the first half last year. The
domestic sector is projected to spend 1.24 billion U.S. dollars, a
drop of 7.7 percent, while the foreign-invested sector should
spend 494.7 million U.S. dollars, up 25.9 percent.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: China Shrinking Steel Output to Boost Development (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- China's bulk steel industry is
planning an unprecedented reduction in output this year to offset
mounting financial pressure from a stagnant domestic market and
stumbling exports.
</P>
<P>
The State Economic and Trade Commission ordered the industry to
curb this year's production to 104 million tons earlier this month,
which will be 10 percent down from last year's amount.
</P>
<P>
China is now, nominally and physically, the world's largest
steel producer, since the output touched 101 million tons in 1996.
The annual production capacity has now reached 190 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Boasting a strong steel industry has been the country's long
cherished goal, since it is highlighted as a measure of national
industrial competitiveness. The industry was on a fast-track of
development as it entered 1990s.
</P>
<P>
However, an inflated production capacity, although propping up
the development of many other industries, has not brought with it
profits equal to its strength. The industry's compound profit
plunged to two billion yuan (240 million U.S. dollars) last year,
compared to its best record of 29 billion yuan (3.5 billion U.S.
dollars) in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The profit dropped at an alarming rate of 66 percent in the
first quarter of this year from the corresponding period of last
year though the output retained an upward trend of seven percent.
</P>
<P>
Some steel works have scrambled to squeeze production costs and
reduce payrolls in efforts to boost revenues. This has generated a
little benefit, although not that obvious. The industry as a whole,
however, is still suffocated by heavy debt due to redundant
production, which has led to sagging prices.
</P>
<P>
"This has resulted in a big waste of resources. The macro-
control of production has been aimed at saving the heavy losses of
the state-owned assets," said Wang Wanbin, director of the State
Administration of Metallurgical Industry (SAMI).
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the reduction could affect company
revenues for this year, it could be the only way out for the
industry in the long run, suggested Yang Xiaoning, head of China
Metallurgical Industry Development Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
He explained that state interference would propel steel
producers to wipe out outdated production lines and restructure
their product mix according to market signals.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, it is expected to drive up the market price of steel
products," Yang said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: China Shrinking Steel Output to Boost Development (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A number of steel producers have made moves to brace themselves
for this reduction strategy. The Wuhan Iron and Steel (Group)
Company (WISC), one of the country's top five steel enterprises,
reported a striking 192 percent year-on-year surge in profits
under a 10-percent drop in output in the January-April period. It
earned 13.75 million U.S. dollars from steel exports in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
The company has pooled more than 20 billion yuan of renovation
spending over the past few years, a considerable amount for steel
producers in China.
</P>
<P>
"Large state-owned enterprises should learn to pinch pennies.
As for now, our competitiveness is measured by technological
ability and renovations," said Liu Benren, WISC's general manager.
</P>
<P>
The company is investing heavily in a silicon-steel production
expansion project, which would increase the capacity from 70,000
tons to 400,000 tons. The high value-added product is badly needed
in the domestic market and as a result involves large amounts of
imports every year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the company's production reduction has been done by
eliminating outdated production capacity, said officials from the
company's special steel works in Huangshi City in central China's
Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
According to SAMI's forecast, this year's steel demand will be
around 100 million tons and imports will be controlled to under
seven million tons.
</P>
<P>
China has removed 30 million tons of outdated steel production
capacity over the past two years and will continue its efforts
this year. SAMI will soon send inspectors to 46 big steel
enterprises to oversee the reduction work. The production of these
companies accounts for about half of the nation's total.

<TEXT>
<P>
Ghana's Barikisu Tettey-Quao was sent off at the 26th minute, but
their goal-keeper Memunatu Sulemana put up a heroic performance,
allowing Ghana to come away with a point.
</P>
<P>
The match was plagued by rough tackles and at the 26th minute,
Tettey-Quao made a dangerous tackle and was sent off. The Ghana
team had to play the rest of the game with one player less.
</P>
<P>
But it was Ghana which played more aggressively after the sending
off while the Australian team appeared a little bit too relaxed.
</P>
<P>
For most time of the match, the Australian team put heavy
pressure on the Ghana defense. But their efforts were all turned
down by brilliant saves by the 21-year-old Sulemana.
</P>
<P>
Both teams failed to score in the first 70 minutes and the game
seemed to be headed for a goalless draw.
</P>
<P>
But at the 74th minute, Australia broke the deadlock through
captain Julie Murray. Ghana's defense was got caught off position
and Murray collected a loose ball and unleashed a poised shot past
Sulemana from about eight meters out.
</P>
<P>
Only one minute later, Ghana got the equalizer as Vivian
Mensah's shot was blocked by Australian goal-keeper Wheeler and
the rebound was slotted home by Nana Gyumfua at the right post.
</P>
<P>
The draw put Ghana and Australia on the second place of group d.
China is now at the top of the group with a 2-1 victory over Sweden
on Saturday.

<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's export volumes for last
month have shown signs of a revival with increases to the United
States, Russia and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Beijing Customs office show that the city's
total exports and imports in May were 623 million U.S. dollars, 21.
7 percent up, among which 273 were exports, 15.2 percent more, or
11.5 percent more than that of March. And the growth rate for
imports was 27.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The exports to Russia increased by 76.7 percent, and clothing
exports saw a continuous increase.
</P>
<P>
The local government's reforms in the exports market and
product structure have contributed to the growth. And it is very
likely that the city will realize its aim of 2.87 billion U.S.
dollars of exports for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
However, economists warn that in general exports in the first
five months were on the decrease, being 6.4 percent less than that
of the corresponding period last year.

<HEADLINE> Three People Arrested for Faulty Highway Culverts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Police in central China's Henan
Province recently arrested three people who are suspected of being
responsible for two improperly-built culverts on a superhighway in
the province.
</P>
<P>
Local police said that Sun Jishun and Lu Chuanlin, who were
acting as the manager and deputy-manager of a real estate company
in neighboring Shaanxi Province, sold the two culverts to an
individual contractor Li Rui for 160,000 yuan (about 19,000 U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Li used stone instead of concrete to build the two culverts,
which were found to have serious flaws that caused 336,000 yuan
worth of damage on the superhighway, a key state project linking
the popular tourist attraction of Luoyang with the city of
Sanmenxia.
</P>
<P>
China has increased quality inspections at engineering projects
since an improperly-built bridge collapsed in the southwestern
city of Chongqing earlier this year, killing 40.
</P>
<P>
The importance of quality on engineering projects has been
emphasized since then to help get more investment in
infrastructure to promote economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Insects Plague Forest In Northeastern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- An infestation of insects in
northeast China's Liaoning Province has affected more than 200,000
hectares of forests.
</P>
<P>
A local official says that the problem is still growing and
more than 20 species of insects have been found to be involved. A
lack of diversity in tree species and the large number of small
trees have lowered the resistance to natural disasters,
specialists say.
</P>
<P>
The situation then got worse with last year's drought and the
abnormally high temperatures that helped insects survive the
winter and also caused illness in trees, according to Sun Yongping,
director of the province's forest insect disease prevention,
recently..
</P>
<P>
Liaoning has a forest coverage rate of only about 30 percent,
with 4.45 million hectares of forests.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has called for urgent help from
forestry people in felling seriously-affected trees, replacing
them with new ones, and using airplanes to spray pesticide. But
officials say that they are still uncertain whether these measures
will have much effect because such a wide area has been affected.
</P>
<P>
The insect infestation could mean a deteriorating situation and
forestry departments are keeping a close eye on the plague, Sun
says.

<HEADLINE> Angola on Brink of Humanitarian Disaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- In Ukama, in central Angola's
Huambo Province, some 18,000 hungry refugees are forced to turn to
rats and wild fruits for a living, as they have run out of food
supply after the rebel National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola (UNITA) cut off roads to the town.
</P>
<P>
Situation with the 150,000 refugees in the neighboring Kuito
City of Bie Province are not any better, with hardly enough food
for one meal a day for most of them, as the cold winter coming
nearer.
</P>
<P>
About four or five dead bodies are carried out of the refugee
camps in the city ever day.
</P>
<P>
In the comparatively calm capital city of Luanda, many have to
sleep on the streets as more and more displaced people are pouring
into the city from northern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Governmental statistics show that there are about 1.6 million
refugees out of the 11 million population in the southern African
country , and almost 3.5 million to four million are directly
affected by the civil war after military conflicts between the
government and UNITA re-started by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is greatly concerned with the situation of
the refugees, which is said to be "on the brink of a humanitarian
disaster."
</P>
<P>
The UN World Food Program and other non-governmental
organizations are speeding up their aid work, with the European
Union declaring to offer 11 million Euro as emergent aid to
Angola.
</P>
<P>
But the relief work was slowed down as the UNITA military men,
who have laid land mines on major roads, are ambushing relief
workers, and the cost for the relief work is turning higher as
relief food has to be transported by air.
</P>
<P>
The Nato's bombing of Kosovo has shifted the attention of the
western world to war refugees from Yugoslavia, thus reduced the
relief donation to the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
The UN World Food Program has only materialize half of their
promised aid to the refugees in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has said it is very hard for itself to
handle the deteriorating refugee situation in the country which
has been plagued by civil war for almost 28 years.

<HEADLINE> Daya Bay Nuke Plant to Increase Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Authorities at the Daya Bay
Nuclear Power Plant in the city of Shenzhen in Guangdong Province,
south China, have been trying hard to counter the adverse effects
of the Asian financial crisis and to increase both power output
and hard currency earnings.
</P>
<P>
They say that they will employ more Chinese technicians to do
maintenance work and supervise equipment purchases to avoid
stockpiling of raw materials and wasting capital.
</P>
<P>
More Chinese equipment will be used to replace imports and to
lower power generating costs.
</P>
<P>
The plant has provided 6.22 billion kwh of electricity for the
Guangdong and Hong Kong grid so far this year, and from January to
May, it provided 3.1 billion kwh of electricity for Hong Kong,
which was a major increase from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Plant authorities say that they plan to provide 13.3 billion
kwh of electricity this year, with 9.31 billion kwh for Hong Kong
and hard currency earnings set at 550 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the plant generated 12.31 billion kwh of electricity,
provided 7.58 billion kwh to Hong Kong and earned 450 million U.S.
dollars in hard currency.
</P>
<P>
The Daya Bay plant was China's first large commercial nuclear
power plant built with foreign capital, equipment, and technology.
It is operated by the Guangdong Nuclear Investment Co. Ltd. and
Hong Kong Nuclear Investment Co. Ltd. and can generate 13.5
billion kwh of electricity annually. It began operation in 1994
with an agreement that 30 percent of the electricity would go to
Guangdong and the remainder to Hong Kong.

had 1,600 private housing deals covering 110,000 square meters of
living space in the first five months of this year, up 20 percent
from last year's corresponding period.
</P>
<P>
Officials say that the increase comes from reforms in the
housing distribution system that are causing local people to buy
their own houses, and some who bought houses several years ago are
moving to larger space.
</P>
<P>
The streamlined procedures and reduced fees and taxes have also
contributed to the increase.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The official opening of a Tanker
Transport Committee means that Chinese shipowners will get better
protection from a disorderly market for shipping crude oil and
petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
The committee is under the direct control of the China
Shipowners' Association (CSA) and consists of CSA members, Chen
Zhongbiao, CSA's director, explained at a recent meeting in
Beijing, where he said that the new committee will have a
principle of mutual benefit and cooperation and will set up
reasonable standards for the shipping of crude oil and petroleum
products by water and protect the interests of shipowners.
</P>
<P>
He says that the committee's main task is to carry out state
policies and regulations, to let government departments know about
the needs and desires of members, and to cooperate with
departments in improving relations among ports, cargo owners, and
members.
</P>
<P>
The committee helps meet the market development needs,
according to Yan Mingyi, the general manager of Shanghai's China
Shipping Tanker Co. Ltd. He says that the world's ships carry 1.8
billion tons of crude oil and petroleum products a year, or about
40 percent of the world's total shipping, and that China imports
more than 30 million tons of crude oil each year. Total Chinese
demand for crude oil is expected to reach 190 million tons this
year.
</P>
<P>
Yan emphasizes that the committee is considered to be an
effective way to set more unified transport prices for crude oil
and petroleum products.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Hosts 200,000 African Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has hosted about 200,000
refugees from various war-ravaged African countries, Zambian
Deputy Minister of Home Affairs Edwin Hatembo said.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia newspaper Monday quoted Hatembo as saying that
Zambia, being a signatory to the 1951 United Nations Convention,
had assumed the obligation to look after displaced persons and
asylum seekers.
</P>
<P>
Officiated at the 30th anniversary of "Africa Refugee Day" here
 Sunday, Hatembo urged the refugees, most of whom lived in
villages without proper documentation, to settle in better areas
to access social services such as education and health.
</P>
<P>
"The policy of the government is not to encourage the
spontaneous settlement of refugees. Those who have settled in
villages are urged to move to settlements where material
assistance and social services are available," said the deputy
minister.
</P>
<P>
Hatembo said Zambia was currently host to 197,000 refugees from
Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Somalia, Rwanda and
Burundi. Among them, 15,000 were urban refugees while 47,000 had
been settled in refugee centers dotted across the country.
</P>
<P>
A further 120,000 had settled in undesignated areas, he said,
adding the government asked them to move to settlement areas.
</P>
<P>
At the same function, Oluseyi Bajulaiye, country representative
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugee (UNHCR),
called for an end to conflicts in the southern African region
which had left thousands of people displaced.
</P>
<P>
Bajulaiye said the UNHCR was saddened by the renewed tension in
the region and commended Zambian President Frederick Chiluba for
his mediatory role to end the conflict in DRC.
</P>
<P>
The only solution to the refugee crisis was for peace and
stability to prevail in the refugees' countries of origin that
would pave way for their repatriation and re-integration, he said.

<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Procuratorates across China
launched a nationwide week long publicity campaign today in a bid
to encourage the reporting of offenses and crimes.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of procurators from the country's 3,600
procuratorial organs went out on the streets to answer people's
questions related to reporting offenses and other legal issues.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP) and Beijing's Xicheng
District Procuratorate jointly set up an information center on the
busy commercial street of Xidan. Many passers-by stopped to look
and ask for information.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Qiong, deputy procurator-general of the SPP, said that
from this year China will hold a similar publicity week in the
last week of every June.
</P>
<P>
The move is designed to improve the ties between the
procuratorial organs and the people, and boost the people's
enthusiasm for reporting crimes to help in the fight against the
underworld, according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Procuratorial organs across China will also hold press
conferences, competitions and information forums to help spread
knowledge about legal matters.
</P>
<P>
"In the first four months of the year, procuratorates
countrywide received 128,000 reports of offenses, up 4.94 percent
over the same period of last year," Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's External Trade Gyrates from Negative to Positive Territory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's total external
trade gyrated from negative to positive territory in May 1999 with
exports growing by 2.6 percent and imports increasing by 5.9
percent, turning around from a year-long unabated declines.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Trade Development Board (TDB) said in a press release
Monday that the country's total trade expanded by 4.2 percent
year-on-year in May 1999 after 12 consecutive months of
contractions.
</P>
<P>
In May, non-oil domestic exports (NODX) grew by a hefty 7.3
percent after a marginal increase of 0.3 percent in April 1999,
non-oil re-exports (NORX) moderated its decline to 3.3 percent
from the double-digit declines in the preceding two months,
non-oil imports picked up by 4.6 percent registering the first
increase since April 1998 and oil domestic exports expanded by 5.1
percent after 20 months of continuous declines, TDB spelt out.
</P>
<P>
This is a reflection of generally improved global electronics
demand and the bottoming out of the crisis-ridden economies
including Malaysia, Thailand, South Korea and Japan, as well as
the rebounding of oil prices on global markets, TDB added.
</P>
<P>
According to TDB, domestic exports of electronic products were
up by 2.6 percent in May 1999 after eight months of consecutive
declines and domestic exports of non-electronic products expanded
strongly by 17.9 percent, reflecting the turnaround in electronic
exports and the strong expansion of non-electronic exports.
</P>
<P>
Of the top five markets, only NODX to Hong Kong continued to
shrink in May this year and NODX to the remaining top markets
recorded positive growth in the month with the U.S market growing
by 0.1 percent, the EU running up by a hefty 10.5 percent,
Malaysia increasing by 6.2 percent, Japan soaring by 24.4 percent
and Hong Kong falling by 12.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
NODX to Thailand, Taiwan, Australia and South Korea also grew
markedly with growth rates ranging from 8.9 percent to 64.0
percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, NODX to emerging markets registered a slight
increase with positive growth seen in China and India markets and
negative growth in most of the other emerging markets.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province in south
China has increased its forest coverage in recent years as a
result of extensive afforestation work.
</P>
<P>
It started a forestry policy in 1991 that was centered on "
protecting, reforesting, and developing" and helped afforestation
by stopping illegal logging of forests. The efforts have increased
forest coverage from 4.6 million hectares in 1985 to 9.19 million.

BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- A special telephone hot-line for
reporting crimes has been set up in procuratorial organs across
the country, officials said today.
</P>
<P>
 The line has the digits "2000" as the last four which will
help people remember it. It is also being fondly tagged as the "
fighter against the corrupt". Anywhere in China, people can dial
the number and be connected to a reporting center in a
procuratorate.
</P>
<P>
 The line has boosted the people's enthusiasm for reporting
offenses and plays a big role in the discovery of graft, bribery
and misconduct in office.
</P>
<P>
 Zhang Qiong, deputy procurator-general of the Supreme People'
s Procuratorate (SPP), said that since it was first introduced
into the SPP last year, the special line has now spread into all
corners of China.
</P>
<P>
 "It is becoming a more and more important tool in fighting
crime for procuratorial organs countrywide," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
 "At present, cases where the clues have been provided by
ordinary Chinese have accounted for about 80 percent of all those
filed and investigated by procuratorates in China," Zhang added.
</P>
<P>
 In the first four months of this year, procuratorates across

<HEADLINE> Residents In Northern Israel Remain in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Residents in northern Israel are
remaining in bomb shelters Monday morning after Hezbollah's
rocket attacks Sunday night in retaliation for the wounding of
three Lebanese civilians by Israeli rockets in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Israeli military officials will re-assess
the situation in the area later Monday to decide whether the
residents can leave the shelters after nervously spending a night
in underground refuges.
</P>
<P>
The residents were instructed to stay in the shelters since
Sunday afternoon after Lebanese reports said two Lebanese women
and a young girl at a village outside the Israeli-occupied
security zone were wounded by a missile fired by the Israeli army.
</P>
<P>
In the night, the Hezbollah, or Party of God, fired two
Katyusha rockets Sunday night at northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Lebanese guerrilla group often fire Katyusha
rockets or mortar fire on Israel's border areas to retaliate the
killing or wounding of Lebanese civilians by Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
After the Hezbollah attack, Israeli fighter planes launched two
raids on suspected Hezbollah bases in the so-called security zone
in south Lebanon, which Israel set up in 1985 allegedly to protect
its northern area from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
This was the fourth time in the past six weeks that residents
in northern Israel had to take cover in bomb shelters.
</P>
<P>
The last time was at the beginning of the month when the
pro-Israeli militia South Lebanon Army withdrew from the Jezzine
enclave in south Lebanon, just outside the security zone.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak has pledged to withdraw
the Israeli army from southern Lebanon within a year. He has until
early next month to form a governing coalition.

<HEADLINE> World Bank-Financed Poverty-Relief Project In Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guizhou Province
is using 19 million U.S. dollars in World Bank loans and 130
million yuan in other funds to plant 65,000 hectares of trees in a
bid to get rid of poverty there.
</P>
<P>
The endeavor is intended to benefit rural people living in
poverty and to promote economic development by improving the
environment. It is part of the World Bank's effort to help 12
underdeveloped provinces and autonomous regions in Central and
southwest China, based on an agreement signed by China and the
World Bank. The 12 areas will plant 545,000 hectares of trees and
establish 5 forest products processing enterprises within the next
4 years, using a total of 200 million U.S. dollars in World Bank
loans, in addition to local government funds.
</P>
<P>
When the Guizhou project is completed, its environment will be
improved and good economic results are expected, with 280,000
people removed from poverty, according to Ying Jianqiang, a senior
engineer in charge of the World Bank project there. He says that
the province will produce 6.4 million cubic meters more of timber
and 72,000 tons of dried and fresh fruits, worth 5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
China has already planted 2.1 million hectares of trees with
World Bank's previous loans.

<HEADLINE> Animal Wastes Generate Energy for Families in Rural South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region has 440,000 rural households using gas generated by animal
waste as fuel for cooking and lighting.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, this is six percent of the total
number of rural homes in this major agricultural area, which is
deficient in more conventional forms of energy like coal and oil.
</P>
<P>
Most of the region's inhabitants -- the Zhuang ethnic minority -
- used to have to scour the mountainsides in search of firewood
for cooking, but the wider use of new forms of energy like gas
generated from pig, sheep, and cow dung has brought the
destruction rate of forest resources down and has in effect
protected the environment of the region.
</P>
<P>
The regional government decided to build another 200,000 of
these gas ponds this year as a major public interest project.
</P>
<P>
China has 55 ethnic groups. The Zhuang have both the longest
history and largest population. Guangxi's more than 16 million
Zhuang live mostly in southern and central parts of the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, the capital of south
China's Guangdong Province, is leading the country in test-tube
baby technology.
</P>
<P>
Zhuang Guanglun, the head of the Reproductive Medical Science

each month.
</P>
<P>
Zhongshan Medical University, Beijing Medical University's
Hospital No.3, and the Shanghai Ji'ai Genetics and IVF Institute --
China USA Center are China's three best-known test-tube baby
centers. Zhuang's center has produced more than 500 test-tube
babies since 1988, when China's first test-tube baby was born in
Beijing. The center has had a success rate of 30 percent. It has
also helped to make clinically healthy babies by selecting genes
without any hereditary diseases from an embryo to implant into a
woman's womb.
</P>
<P>
China's first test-tube baby, Zheng Mengzhu, is now 11 years
old. On March 10, 1998, she was invited to return from Gansu
Province to Beijing to celebrate her 10th birthday by Hospital No.
3, where she was born. The hospital has produced more than 200
test tube babies, with a success rate of 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
A dozen hospitals in China have the service and have produced
about 1,000 test tube babies. The world's first test tube baby was
born in Britain in 1978.

<HEADLINE> Township Enterprises in Northeast China Achieve Better Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Township enterprises in China's
Liaoning Province generated 112 billion yuan (13.6 billion U.S.
dollars) in output value at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Management and property rights restructuring have helped revive
a large number of enterprises, whose exports last year exceeded 28
billion yuan, up seven percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Gao Maoxin, the vice-head of township enterprise administration,
says that these enterprises have developed rapidly since the mid-
1980s because of their flexibility in decision making and
management, and greater competitiveness than large and medium-
sized state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
A series of new provincial government policies over the last
two years have further helped development. Statistics show that 30,
000 companies have been involved in the property rights
restructuring and that 2,800 have become share-holding companies.
</P>
<P>
Gao says that the reforms have also helped enterprises make
better use of tens of billions of yuan in idle assets and to get
nearly 4 billion yuan in funds and remove 5.8 billion yuan in
debts.

HANGZHOU, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The rapidly increasing number of
Internet users in China has paved the way for the introduction of
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
There were two million registered Internet users in China at
the end of 1998, and the number is estimated to rise to 20 million
by the year 2000, laying a good foundation for the development of
e-commerce in the country.

<P>
Electronic business activities, such as on-line ticketing,
shopping, banking and securities trading, as well as declaration
of dutiable goods, are gaining popularity among Chinese commercial
circles and ordinary residents.
</P>
<P>
A growing number of government departments have launched
websites on the Internet, in answer to the "Government-Online"
plans, which call for 60 percent of related departments to be
available on-line by the end of 1999, with the figure rising to 80
percent by 2000.
</P>
<P>
E-commerce is drawing increasing attention from the Chinese
government and the country's electronic-commerce framework is to
be publicized soon by an office under the Ministry of the
Information Industry.
</P>
<P>
East China's Zhejiang Province, one of the country's economic
giants, had 50,000 registered Internet users by the end of April,
with the figure growing by 20 percent annually. Some 80 percent of

bilateral relationships, because this year marks the 50th
anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that Russia-China cooperation in the 21st
century will be featured by political stability, high economic
efficiency, mutual respect and equality between the people of the

<HEADLINE> China Slashes Coal Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- China produced 406.8 million tons
of coal in the first five months of the year, a fall of 6.52
percent from the same period last year, according to a report by
the State Administration of Coal Industry.
</P>
<P>
The reduced coal output, which accounts for 39.4 percent of
this year's 1.03-billion-ton target, is to respond to less demand
in the market. China's coal market is still overly saturated. By
the end of May, China had a stockpile of nearly 70 million tons of
coal.
</P>
<P>
Also by the end of last month, China closed down 23,168 coal
mines, which account for 89.8 percent of the total number of coal
mines to be shut down this year.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the country will continue to eliminate
small coal mines, which are wasteful and pollutants.

<P>
HARBIN, June 21 (Xinhua)-- China is launching its first
wholesales commodity center in new Siberia according to a trade
official of the city of Jiamusi in Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The center now under construction in the city of Novosibirsk
will be the largest wholesales network exclusively for Chinese
goods in Siberia, the official says. Work on the 2,200-sq.m.
center is in its initial stage and is to be completed by the end
of August.
</P>
<P>
Over 30 Chinese enterprises, including some well-known big
firms across the country, have agreed to put their products there
and the Russian government has supported the project because many
Chinese goods are very popular within the Russians for their high
quality and relatively low price. Currently, the Siberian market
is flooded with goods from the United States, Britain, France,
Germany, Italy, and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The 34 million people in Novosibirsk and a large area around it
are potential buyers of Chinese products, the official says.

<HEADLINE> Air China Shows Gains in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Air China, the biggest airlines in
the country, reported gains in April and May this year after
recording serious losses in 1998, according to a responsible
official from the company.
</P>
<P>
 It is the first time this year that the company has said that
it made a profit, following reduction of losses in the first
quarter. The company did not disclose how much profit it had made
in the two months, but provide statistics that show the airlines'
passenger and freight turnover in April and May increasing 23.7
percent and 26.5 percent over the same period in 1998 and income
rising by 22.6 percent and 9.3 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The freight turnover reached 534 million tons during January-
May, up 38.45 percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
 China's civil aviation sector suffered from serious losses in
1998, due to the Asian financial crisis and its low efficiency. As
a result, the General Administration of Civil Aviation of China (
CAAC) vowed to turn those losses into a profit across the whole
sector this year.
</P>
<P>
 Ma Xulun, vice president of Air China, attributed the
positive result to the company's market-oriented efforts which
included strict control over costs.

<HEADLINE> Freed Italians to Continue Work in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The three Italians recently freed
by Iranian abductors will continue their work in Iran, a
representative from their company Danieli said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The representative told reporters at Tehran airport that after
meeting their families, the Italians will return to their work in
the Alloy Steel Plant in Iran's central province of Yazd.
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo Termite, Giuseppe Zisa and Riccardo Pasinato arrived
in Tehran early Monday morning from Zahedan, capital of the
southeastern Sistan-Baluchestan province, which borders
Afghanistan and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the airport, Termite said
that he and his colleagues were freed around 13:00 local times
(0830 GMT) on Sunday after Iranian security forces reached an
agreement with the abductors.
</P>
<P>
The three Italians were taken captive on June 13 when they were
on a trip to see historical sites in Bam in the central province
of Kerman.
</P>
<P>
Termite believed that the abduction was pre-planned, saying
one of the six abductors called Reza said two of their men had
been jailed by Iranian authorities in Shiraz in southern Iran.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Italian engineer said the abductors first
introduced themselves as members of Taliban (the Afghan ruling
group), but later claimed they are Baluchis, the ethnic people
living in Sistan-Baluchestan province.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the press conference, Italian ambassador to
Iran Ludovico Ortona thanked Iranian authorities for taking
effective measures to set free the three Italian nationals.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman of Iranian Interior Ministry Bahaoddin
Sheikholeslami announced Sunday that the Italians were freed
after a group of Iranian information and security personnel
entered into negotiation with the kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
But he gave no details about the negotiation and any possible
deal with the abductors.
</P>
<P>
He did not reveal the identities of the abductors and whether
they were arrested following the release of the Italians.
</P>
<P>
However, Governor General of the Sistan-Baluchestan province
Mahmoud Husseini told the Islamic Republic News Agency on Monday
that the abductors are bandits and drug smugglers.
</P>
<P>
He said that the abduction had no political motive, but "they
wanted to draw the attention of the government."

LHASA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- A seven-year-old outdoor market in
the town of Zhangmu on the Sino-Nepalese border begins filling up
with Chinese and Nepalese business people haggling over prices
with the help of their electronic calculators even in the early
morning.
</P>
<P>
Because of geography and communications problems, the market
does not straddle the borderline but was located 8.7 kilometers
inside Chinese territory in Tibet, which Nepalese traders have to
cross the Friendship Bridge to reach.
</P>
<P>
According to an a Chinese and Nepalese government agreement,
people living within a 30-km. strip of the border are free to come
and go as they please. At the very beginning, the market only
operated on Saturdays, but it got so busy it had to open every day.
</P>
<P>
Chinese business people have over 50 shops dealing mainly in
electric goods, soaps, and shirts and the tax-free trade attracts
a lot of merchants from both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
Doing business here is worthwhile, Yin Yan, a Sichuan woman
said. The businesswomen sometimes can sell nearly 800 yuan worth
of goods a day.
</P>
<P>
There are on average 500 to 600 Nepalese business people coming
to the market each day and some Chinese have begun learning
Nepalese in their spare time because the language problem makes it
difficult to do business.

<HEADLINE> Norway Beats Russia 2-1 in Women's World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Brit Sandaune and Marianne
Pettersen scored as Norway opened its defense of the Women's World
Cup title with a 2-1 win over Russia in a Group C match at Foxboro
Stadium, Massachusetts of the United States on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Norway improved to 11-2-0 all-time in the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Norway held a big offensive advantage against Russia, which was
making its World Cup debut. With the win, the Norwegians moved to
the top of the group, two points ahead of Japan and Canada that
tied 1-1 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I'm satisfied. I was pleased we created 19 good chances,"
Norway coach Per-Mathias Hogmo said. "It was a good win and we
will get better each day."
</P>
<P>
Norway opened the game with constant offensive pressure and
broke through in the 17th minute. Silke Jorgensen floated a cross
from the left side that was headed on by forward Pettersen.
Sanduane lifted a shot over the onrushing goalkeper Svetlana Petko
and into the net despite the best effort of defender Marina
Bourakova.
</P>
<P>
Norway held a clear advantage in the first half, outshooting
Russia 14-1 holding a 10-1 edge in corner kicks.
</P>
<P>
Pettersen was a danger all day in the offensive end and cashed
in one of her six shots in the 68th minute. A cross by Sandaune
was headed off Pettersen by Natalia Karesseva, but Pettersen
settled the ball and slipped it inside the left post.
</P>
<P>
"I thought we played OK," said Pettersen. "I hope we score more.
I'm happy I scored at least one goal."
</P>
<P>
Norway kept attacking, but the tactic backfired and allowed
Russia back in the game in the 77th minute. Irina Grigorieva ran
down a loose ball at the Norway touch line. Natalia Barbachina
settled the cross with her back to the goal and pushed a pass to
the edge of the penalty area, where Galina Komarova rocketed a
shot past goal keeper Bente Nordby into the top of the net.
</P>
<P>
"I'm satisfied with the match," Russia coach Yurii Bystrizkii
said. "I'm happy with the result. This was our first World Cup. We
are now focused on our next few games and our goal is to reach the
second round and finish second in our group."
</P>
<P>
The Russians were not able to come close to tying the game
after their goal.
</P>
<P>
Irina Gringorieva had three of the five second-half shots for
the Russians as they started to solve the Norweigan defense. She
forced Nordby to make her only save on a 35-yard shot.
</P>
<P>
"We were shaky in the back four," Hogmo added. "Russia was not
as close to us as the score would show. They were lucky to be in
it with us as long as they were."
</P>
<P>
Norway outhshot Russia 28-6 and forced Petko to make nine saves.
</P>
<P>
In another match played at Forxboro Stadium, Australia tied
Ghana 1-1 in Group D.
</P>
<P>
Australia opened the scoring in the 74th minute through Murray
Julie, but Ghana's Nana Gyamua tied the score two minutes later.
</P>
<P>
In their first appearance at an important international
tournament, Ghana's Black Queens impressed with a great fighting
spirit. Australia dominated the game from the start but failed to
capitalise when the African team was reduced to 10 after 26
minutes, needing 74 minutes to open the score.
</P>
<P>
Barikisu Tettey-Quao was sent out the field and four yellow
cards were flashed by American referee Kari Seitz in the game.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Defeats Peru in Soccer Friendly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Playing on home turf, Venezuela
scored three goals against nil in a soccer friendly against Peru
on Sunday, boosting its morale for the American Cup soccer
tournament next month.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time for Venezuela to beat Peru in the past
10 years as it only recorded two wins, two draws and 10 losses in
their previous 14 encounters.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Venezuela had its last victory of 3-1 against Peru.
</P>
<P>
The first leg of the two-game friendly series was played in
Valencia, 150 kilometers away from Caracas, wherein the hosts
found the nets three times through Edson Tortolero, Jose Manuel
Rey and Fernando Orne Las in the 28th, 41st and 62nd minutes
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Coached by Argentine Jose Omar Pastoriza, Venezuela has
recently achieved promising progresses, including draws against
both Denmark and Colombia, double victories over Ecuador and a
tight loss against Argentina.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the match, the hosts resorted to active offenses
with speed through the midfield, but faced little pressure from
their counterparts who lacked cooperation in attacks and back-up
penetration.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the friendly was full of firepowers with rude actions from
both sides and furious protests against Venezuelan referee Paolo
Borbosano who fished out two red cards and six yellow cards.
</P>
<P>
The second friendly is slated on June 23rd in Lima, Peru,
before both sides will set off for Paraguay for the uncoming
American Cup soccer tournament from June 29 to July 18.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Chinese Put Environmental Responsibility on Government's Shoulders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- A large number of Chinese people
regard environmental protection as the government's business, a
recent survey shows.
</P>
<P>
Conducted by the State Environmental Protection Administration
and the Ministry of Education, the survey lasted from July to
October 1998, investigating 9,202 samples from 31 provinces,
municipalities and regions nationwide, and covering the widest
range and largest number of samples of any survey of its kind.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that the general public recognizes that China
has a serious environmental pollution problem -- water and air
pollution being the people's major concerns. The survey also shows
that educational level is the dominant factor deciding the public'
s environmental awareness.
</P>
<P>
The survey concluded that it is due to the government-dominated
pattern of China's environmental protection that the public's
environmental awareness tends to be government-oriented.
</P>
<P>
The general public has no clear idea of what it should and can
do for environmental protection, according to the survey. People
are more concerned about environmental problems closely related to
their own daily lives and what the government is doing to solve
their problems than about the environment far away from them,
according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
As for the relationship between economic development and
environmental protection, the survey found that public opinion
tends to prioritize the former.

<HEADLINE> German Investment in Thailand to Grow 30 Percent in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 21 (Xinhua) -- German investment in Thailand is
expected to increase by 30 percent this year to 5.7 billion baht
(154 million U.S. dollars), the German-Thai Chamber of Commerce
said in a report, which is available Monday.
</P>
<P>
Direct investment from Germany in Thailand totaled 4.3 billion
baht (116 million dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
To promote further investments in Thailand, the chamber is
organizing a technology symposium in Bangkok in November, which is
expected to attract over 100 companies and will give Thai
manufacturers an opportunity to meet potential partners, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
German companies in pharmaceuticals, metal and auto parts were
showing great interest in Thailand. Some German companies were
shifting their regional offices to Thailand, the report said.
</P>
<P>
German auto parts makers have taken a keen interest in
developing Thailand as a regional hub for manufacturing. BMW is
setting up a plant in Thailand for domestic and international
exports.
</P>
<P>
German direct investment accounted for about one percent of
total foreign investment in 1998. However, it has increased to
about 3 percent and is still rising in 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government will ban
import of dairy and poultry products from Belgium following
reports of contamination of those items by cancer-causing dioxin,
The Daily Star newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Only a mere formality remains. If the minister signs (the
papers) today, the ban will take effect immediately," Fazlur
Rahman, deputy secretary in the ministry, was quoted as saying on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said the government had decided to ban only those items from
Belgium because "we have specific information about dioxin
contamination. If needed ban will be imposed on import of such
items from France and the Netherlands also," he said.
</P>
<P>
High-level dioxin was recently detected in Belgian poultry and
eggs, and the contamination also spread to France and the

<HEADLINE> Agricultural Minister Urges Better Crop Mix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- China is set to optimize its crop
mix to upgrade grain quality in the face of mounting grain
reserves and an expected bumper summer harvest, according to the
Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Agriculture Chen Yaobang was quoted by Monday's
China Daily as saying that cutting down the acreage growing
inferior strains and expanding production of high-grade grain and
cotton have been listed as the ministry's top priorities.
</P>
<P>
Years of bumper harvests and a continuous emphasis on quantity
by the government have created large stockpiles of grain and
cotton, which are believed to have outstripped market demand, said
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Growing areas for grain strains of low quality, including
Spring wheat crops in northeast China and indica rice in south
China, will be cut substantially, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"The agricultural departments nationwide should work out a crop-
growing mix readjustment program compatible with local natural,
economic and technological conditions," the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed promotion of high-quality crops and marketable
cash crops through supply of fine seed strains and introduction of
modern technology.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Public Condemns Doctors' Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 21 (Xinhua) -- A week long strike since last
Monday by Sri Lanka's government doctors has been severely
condemned by the public who have been greatly inconvenienced.
</P>
<P>
The public wants the government to take stern action against
the doctors who were educated with public funds and whose salaries
are being paid for by the public, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of patients have been turned away from state
hospitals since June 14 as about 4,500 doctors of the Government
Medical Officers Association (GMOA) began an indefinite strike.
</P>
<P>
A retired government doctor condemned the strike as being
totally unethical and a disgrace to the profession.
</P>
<P>
The GMOA leadership were accused of trying to boost their ego
through strike action at the expense of hundreds of thousands of
the poor, most of them villagers who could ill-afford to pay
private medical bills.
</P>
<P>
Hospital authorities said only emergency services were
functioning at hundreds of state-run hospitals across Sri Lanka
while other routine operations and services had been rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
The GMOA called the strike in protest against a court petition
filed by the chief minister of the North Western Provincial
Council, who wants provincial control over health services.
</P>
<P>
All appointments, transfers and other official matters are
currently decided by the central government's Public Service
Commission.
</P>
<P>
A GMOA spokesman said Sunday that they will continue their
strike defying a Presidential Essential Service Order, until the
government gives a firm assurance that the problem that initiated
their action will be solved.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka provides free health services to its citizens, but
state hospitals are overcrowded and those who can afford it seek
treatment at private hospitals.

separatist military group in a mud-floored tent outside Pristina
early Monday, reports reaching here said.
</P>

BRUSSELS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Patrick Rafter waited five hours
and came from a first-set deficit to win the Heineken Trophy grass
court title in Den Bosch, the Netherlands on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian world No. 2 retained his ATP Heineken title with
a hard win of 3-6, 7-6 (9-7) and 6-4 over unseeded Romanian Andrei
Pavel after the rain delayed the competition for five hours.
</P>
<P>
Despite the miserable conditions, both players performed a
competitive but good-natured duel to entertain the patient crowd.
</P>
<P>
Pavel, who ranked 66th in the world, took the first set by
breaking Rafter's serve in the eighth game.
</P>
<P>
Rafter had to save a match point at 6-5 down in the second-set
tiebreaker, but after that never looked back.
</P>
<P>
Stepping up a gear and playing almost faultless tennis, Rafter
broke twice in the final set to take a 5-1 lead. Pavel came back
to 5-4 but the end was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
The play had begun almost at the last possible moment as both
players were waiting to be whisked away by helicopter to London,
where Rafter is seeded No.2 and Pavel is scheduled to play a first-
round match against Andre Agassi on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Satisfied With G-8 Statement on Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan expressed its
satisfaction at the G-8 statement on the situation in Kashmir in a
press release issued by the Foreign Office late Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
According to the press release, the G-8 has expressed its deep
concern on the continuing military confrontation in Kashmir and
has called for an end to military action as well as respect for
the Line of Control (LoC) by both India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The G-8 has also called for the resumption of the dialogue
between the two South Asian countries in the spirit of the Lahore
Declaration.
</P>
<P>
This amounts to "virtual endorsement of Pakistan's stand" which
it had taken at the foreign minister meeting in New Delhi on June
12, 1999, said the press release.
</P>
<P>
"India's rejection of the dialogue process has been clearly not
acceptable," observed the release. "Pakistan's stand that the
hostilities in Kashmir should be halted, the LoC mutually
respected and the dialogue resumed for a peaceful solution has
been upheld by the G-8 Summit leaders."
</P>
<P>
The press release also urged the international community to
"engage itself in facilitating the resumption of the dialogue
between India and Pakistan for a final settlement of the Kashmir
dispute."
</P>
<P>
Since early May, Pakistan and India have been engaged in an
intensifying artillery dual across the LoC in the disputed
Himalayan region of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz paid a visit to New
Delhi on June 12, in a bid to defuse the tension between the two
countries, but his talks with his Indian counterpart Jaswant Singh
ended fruitlessly, after which India declared to continue its
military strikes against Muslim fighters in India-held Kashmir who
were claimed to have infiltrated from the Pakistani side.
</P>
<P>
In order to seek international sympathy, Pakistan has sent its
ambassador to the United Nations, Munir Akram, as the special
envoy to the G-8 Summit in Cologne, Germany, to brief the G-8
leaders on the latest developments in Kashmir.

NEW YORK, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft chief Bill Gates
continued to be listed by Forbes magazine as the world's richest
with net worth of 90 billion U.S. dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
For three years running Gates has topped the list of
billionaires, with net up from 36.4 billion dollars in 1996, 51
billion dollars in 1997. His wealth is to surpass 100 billion
dollars coming April, said Forbes which tracks billionaires.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> N.Ireland Peace Faces 10-Day Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Sunday that last
year's landmark peace deal for Northern Ireland could unravel over
the summer if parties fail to bury the hatchet this month.
</P>
<P>
Pro-British Protestant and Irish nationalist Roman Catholic
political leaders face a June 30 deadline to seal the peace as
negotiating deadlock and a rise in street violence threaten a
return of the "Troubles" that reigned for three decades.
</P>
<P>
UK's Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam warned both sides
they must resolve their differences in 10 days -- or else.
</P>
<P>
"They've both got to take their blinkers off, take risks and go
forward. Now it isn't going to be easy but unless we get something
in place, it (peace) will slowly unravel I believe over the
summer," Mowlam told BBC television.
</P>
<P>
"We have 10 days...We can do it if we try," she said.
</P>
<P>
The impasse centres on the surrender of guerrilla weapons and
has stalled the creation of a new all-party executive, elected
last year.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who helped broker the
so-called Good Friday accord, has cleared his diary for the final
days of June, aiming to harry the British-ruled province into a
long-awaited peace, according to a Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, who has intervened directly in
previous phases of negotiation, has told Blair that he too is
ready to do anything he can to help.
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't ask for a better situation and the 30th deadline,
I think, is a clear focus," Mowlam was quoted saying.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed by Blair, his Irish counterpart Bertie
Ahern and a range of Protestant and Catholic parties in April
1998, has stalled over demands for Irish Republican Army (IRA)
guerrillas to disarm.
</P>
<P>
A series of talks led by Blair and Ahern have so far failed to
bridge the gulf between David Trimble, the province's "unionist"
first minister, and Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, the IRA's
political arm.
</P>
<P>
Trimble refuses to form a coalition cabinet that would include
Sinn Fein until the IRA hands in weapons that fuelled a 30-year
onslaught against British rule.
</P>
<P>
Blair visited Belfast last week and is expecting to go again
and take part personally in talks as the deadline approaches.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Britain's Sky News television, Blair
admitted it would be "very difficult indeed" to meet the deadline,
but said the alternative was too grim to contemplate.
</P>
<P>
"There's a whole generation of young people in Northern Ireland
for whom this is the last chance," Blair said. "I don't believe we
will be forgiven if we can't do it."
