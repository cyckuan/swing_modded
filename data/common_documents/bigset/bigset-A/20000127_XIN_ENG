<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese star center Ba Te'er
had 58 points and 16 rebounds to inspire Beijing Ducks to a 99-81
victory over Nanjing Army in the 20th round of China's
professional basketball league in Changzhou, Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter, both teams appeared slow to start and
shot a low percentage from the field. Ba Te'er showed his strength
near the hoop in the second quarter and helped the Ducks to lead
at half-time 59-40.
</P>
<P>
The Army threw their best to smother Ba Te'er in the second
half but the efforts turned out to be futile.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing was still one of the two teams which collected just one
victory against 19 defeats so far. The other team was Hubei Mei'
erya, which also lost at home to Zhejiang Cyclone 82-107 Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yudong had 39 points, 9 rebounds, 4 assists and Fan Bin

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Urges UN Involvement in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni urged the United Nations to support the faltering Lusaka
agreement on the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions on the DRC issue and Uganda's future role
in the region in CNN's Talk Show program in New York on Wednesday,
Museveni defended Uganda's military involvement in the DRC by
saying that it is to guarantee its border safety, to stop
recurrence of genocide in Rwanda and eastern DRC and thus achieve
national as well as regional stability.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Untied Nations should support the Lusaka
agreement logistically. He blamed the world body for being
insensitive to African problems previously. However, he noted,
the U.N. Security Council's special session on the DRC issue
shows that the U.N. is paying more attention to Africa.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the impact on economy of his country's
involvement in the DRC , Museveni said the economy has been
growing at a rate of over 6 percent per annum since 1986 and that
Uganda's military presence in the DRC did not affect the national
economy adversely.
</P>
<P>
The 55-year-old president also addressed issues of AIDS
orphans and the country's current priorities. He said Uganda
would try to contribute as much as possible to regional peace and
stability and create favorable environment for economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Museveni is currently attending a week-long U.N. meeting on
the DRC issue. Leaders of countries involved in the DRC conflict
were also invited to the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Hostages in Sudan to Be Repatriated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese government will
repatriate on Friday morning 21 Ugandans, including 18 children,
abducted by a Sudan-based Ugandan rebel group.
</P>
<P>
A total of 75 Ugandans who were held hostage in Sudan by
Uganda's Lord Resistance Army (LRA) will be released in batches in
the near future, the Sudanese News Agency quoted unnamed officials
as saying on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation comes in line with the normalization process
between the two countries envisaged in an accord signed by Sudanese
President Omar al-Bashir and his Ugandan counterpart Yoweri
Museveni in Kenyan capital city Nairobi last December.
</P>
<P>
Sudan is committed to the implementation of the accord, the
Sudanese officials said, noting that the United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) and the United States' Carter Center were cooperating
with Sudan in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Up to Tuesday, Sudan repatriated 57 Ugandans from the capital
city, Khartoum, and another eight from Goba, provincial capital of
Bahr El-Gazzal in southern Sudan, according to a UNCEF liaison
officer.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan government said that about 2,000 Ugandans are still held
captives in the hand of LRA rebels.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Sudan severed diplomatic relations in April 1995,
accusing each other of backing rebels operating on their respective
lands.

<HEADLINE> Annan Hails Successful Completion of Elections in Guinea-Bissau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Thursday welcomed the successful completion of
elections in Guinea-Bissau and commended its people for
demonstrating a firm commitment to democracy and peace and for
working together to overcome recent difficulties.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here by his spokesman, Annan, who is
in Moscow on a three-day visit to Russia, extended his warm
congratulations to president-elect, Kumba Yala, and to the interim
President, Malam Bacai Sanha, for the "positive and statesmanlike
manner in which they conducted their electoral campaign."
</P>
<P>
Noting that Guinea-Bissau would need international cooperation
to consolidate its newly restored democracy and enhance prospects
for sustainable development, Annan reaffirmed continued U.N.
support and appealed to the international community to provide
urgently needed assistance to the new government.
</P>
<P>
The results of the January 16 presidential elections were
officially announced by Guinea-Bissau's National Electoral
Commission on January 21.
</P>
<P>
The elections were seen as a key step toward restoring
normalcy to the former Portuguese colony of 1.1 million people
after a devastating 11-month conflict. The civil war culminated in
President Joao Bernardo Vieira's ouster in May last year.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges Russia to Protect Chechen Civilians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 27 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Thursday urged Russia to pay more attention to protecting
the rights and freedom of civilians in Chechnya while fighting
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who was here on a three-day official visit, met Thursday
with Yegor Stroyev, speaker of Russia's upper house, the
Federation Council, and Gennady Seleznyov, speaker of the State
Duma lower house of parliament, Russian media reported.
</P>
<P>
Stroyev, for his part, said the struggle against terrorism in
Chechnya must not be stopped halfway
</P>
<P>
He told reporters following the meeting with Annan that "if the
conflict in Chechnya is not carried through to the end a second
time, there will be further bloodshed."
</P>
<P>
"The conflict in the North Caucasus must not be escalated, but
the struggle against terrorism must not be halted," the Interfax
news agency quoted Stroyev as saying.
</P>
<P>
Besides Chechnya, Annan and Stroyev also discussed Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. secretary general agreed that it is impossible to
solve all problems in Chechnya at one go. He said, however, that
the conflict should be settled as soon as possible on the basis of
the U.N resolution concerning the struggle against terrorism,"
Stroyev said.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov, during this meeting with Annan, stressed that
Russian federal forces do not want to hurt civilians trapped in
Chechnya, but the militants blocked their flight and tried to use
them as human shields.
</P>
<P>
Annan is expected to meet Russian Acting President Vladimir
Putin and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He will also see Vyacheslav Trubnikov, director of the Russian
Foreign Intelligence Service, in a "strictly confidential" meeting
proposed by Annan, Interfax said, citing sources.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his Moscow talks, Annan will leave for Geneva to
chair talks on a settlement in Cyprus, Interfax reported.

<HEADLINE> WEF President Calls for More Attention to Deal With Long-Term Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, SWITZERLAND, January 27 (Xinhua) -- President of the
World Economic Forum (WEF) Professor Kalus Schwab has warned the
world not to be complacent although the overall economic situation
this year is better than those in the previous years.
</P>
<P>
"There is one striking feature that differentiates this year's
Annual Meeting from the last ones: at this particular moment, we
are not confronted with any overwhelming crisis," Schwab said.
</P>
<P>
"You will recall that in 1999 we were deeply worried about the
global economic outlook; and two years ago, it was the Asian
crisis which was at the center of our attention. This year,
without such a crisis preoccupying our minds, we have even more
reasons to look at the truly important fundamental, long-term
challenges of our world at the beginning of the new millennium,"
he went on.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, we are celebrating this month the longest lasting
expansion of the US economy since at least the mid-19th century.
Yes, the Asian crisis seems to be overcome. Yes, Europe is on the
verge of an economic boost, and even the Y2K bug turned out to be
just a small creeping creature," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the WEF founder stressed that, with all this good news,
the moment is appropriate to remember how vulnerable everything is,
humankind, ecology, economy, politics and so on. "Therefore, the
motto for this gathering should be let's fight complacency," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the problems of poverty, national,
religious and ideological conflicts, terrorism, nuclear
proliferation,pollution, corruption, and many others are items
left over business of the last century that must still figure on
the agenda of the international community.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the most important challenge for the 21st century
is to bridge the paradox between the harsh business reality and
human and social values," he said. "This is not done by
superficially favouring either side or by simple cliches, but by
the daily practice of truly value based."
</P>
<P>
"The motto is fighting complacency, the focus is the new world
of the 21st century, but the criterion for success is our
capability to make a difference and live up to our mission of
being committed to improving the state of the world," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Swiss President Calls for Responsible Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, SWITZERLAND, January 27 (Xinhua) -- President of the
Swiss confederation Adlof Ogi called on world leaders in politics
and business to proceed with globalization in a responsible manner.
</P>
<P>
Speaking here Thursday at the opening of the annual meeting of
the World Economic Forum (WEF), Ogi told the participants that "it
is up to you to ensure free-trade is compatible with the good of
the global community.".
</P>
<P>
He said that while capital movements could generate progress,
productivity and prosperity, they could also force whole economies
and nations into depression.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss president said that this power meant that industry
and commerce had growing social responsibilities, and that the
evolution of the world economy should therefore be determined by
society as a whole.
</P>
<P>
He reminded his audience of the protests at last year's trade
summit in Seattle and said these was "a clear sign of the mistrust
felt by many regarding globalization".
</P>
<P>
Ogi said the chief aim of the economy was not to generate
maximum profits for shareholders, but rather to help achieve
liberty and justice. He said politicians should therefore seek a
more global role, by fixing global rules for economic development.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Displaced People Living in Desperate Condition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LUANDA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Displaced Angolans in the north
region are living a desperate life without food, water, houses and
medicaments, while the officers of the government troops qualified
the military operation in the north front as "positive", official
news department said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The population living in the city of Maquela Do Zombo recently
liberated by the government troops from the rebels led by Jonas
Savimbi, which is located 254 kilometers north to the provincial
capital of Uige, are also racked by the rampant epidemic diseases,
including acute diarrhoea, malaria, tuberculosis, pneumonia,
anaemia and malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
According to the municipal administrator Afonso Cuca, the
deteriorating humanitarian crisis is the unavoidable consequence
of the month-long destructive combat around and in the city.
</P>
<P>
Cuca said that the immediate task for his local government is
to improve the living conditions of the population, especially in
the field of health and education. Near the city close to the
Angolan-Democratic Republic of the Congolese border, six bridges
have been destroyed by the rebels, leaving the city isolated from
the outside world and standing without support.
</P>
<P>
But the Commander of the North Front Lieutenant-General Marcos
Correia Banza said on Thursday that the sweeping operation in the
north region have produced "positive" results, putting 14 of the
16 cities in the north Uige Province under the control of the
government troops. Before it was recaptured by the Armed Forces of
Angola (FAA), the city had been under the control of the Angolan
rebels for more than 16 months, said the source.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Shilling Drops After Speculative Wave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan shilling Thursday
dropped to 69.88 against the U.S. dollar from last Friday's
nine-month high of 67.30.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Kenya posted the shilling at an opening
commercial mean rate of 69.88 to the dollar from 69.43 on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has played a pivotal role in stemming a
speculative wave of short covering that pushed the shilling off a
nine-month high of 67. 30 last Friday, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said 70.00 would provide strong support for the
shilling over the next few weeks unless there was a dramatic
announcement from an International Monetary Fund team, which is
in Kenya to discuss the possible resumption of a
205-million-dollar loan suspended in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Before the team arrived in the country the shilling moved up by
about eight percent over a week in anticipation of a favorable
announcement from the fund.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Defense Counsels Seek Dismissal of Treason Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 DAR ES SALAAM, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Defense counsels in
Zanzibar treason case involving 18 opposition Civic United Front
(CUF) activists Thursday asked the High Court to dismiss the
charge because the Isles does not stand as a sovereign state and
therefore cannot be overthrown.
</P>
<P>
"The treason cannot be committed as Zanzibar is not a
sovereign state," the advocate Hamid Bwezeleni told the court
which was also attended by CUF Secretary General Seif Sharriff
Hamad and the party's Vice Chairman Shaaban Mloo.
</P>
<P>
 Zanzibar had seized to exist as an independent state since
April 1964, after it surrendered its sovereignty as a result of a
merger with the then Tanganyika, explained him.
</P>
<P>
Bwezeleni, the former Attorney General in Zanzibar, was
supported by another defense counsel Ussi Khamis, who said the
case is time barred due to the prosecution's delay to start
hearing of the trial for over two years.
</P>
<P>
Under the Zanzibar laws of criminal procedures, a person
suspected for the treason must be tried by the prosecution within
two years since the offence is committed, he said.
</P>
<P>
The defense counsels objected to an application raised by a
senior state attorney Othman Makungu who seeks for adjournment to
enable the new Attorney General Saleh Dahoma to study the case
file and get prepared for the trial.
</P>
<P>
Makungu said the case file had been handed over to the new
Attorney General on Wednesday following the removal of his
predecessor Ali Mohammed Omar.
</P>
<P>
In their submission, the counsels said it was not fair to
grant the adjournment on grounds that the case file was in the AG
chamber for a long time and the change of prosecutors is not an
excuse at all.
</P>
<P>
However, the Nigerian Judge chairing the court Garba Tumaka
adjourned the session until February 28 this year.
</P>
<P>
He said he expects the prosecution will at that time be in a
position to respond to the arguments raised by the defense
counsels and to begin hearing of the trial.
</P>
<P>
The 18 defendants were arrested on charges they conspired to
overthrow President Salmin Amour of the semi-autonomous Zanzibar
region in the Indian Ocean off mainland Tanzania. Four of the
suspects are members of Zanzibar's 50-seat Parliament.

<HEADLINE> UN Official Says Tanzanian Poverty Population Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The people living in
absolute poverty in Tanzania during the past 38 years has declined
from 63 percent to 42 percent, a UN official said this week.
</P>
<P>
Findings indicate there has been a steady decline in the
number of the poor since the country's independence, said the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) Resident Representative
Sally Fegan Wyles.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the achievement to good and relevant
social programs launched by the Tanzanian government, adding that
universal primary education, adult education, road construction,
health, water schemes had all been geared towards poverty
alleviation.
</P>
<P>
However, Sally warned that more efforts are needed to
economically empower the Tanzanian people because the country is
facing problems brought by the fast increasing populations.
</P>
<P>
Official figures say in Tanzania, out of 700,000 school
leavers and drop-outs entering the labor market each year, only
40,000 of them get jobs in the formal sector.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Parliament Passes New Family Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's People's Assembly (lower
house) endorsed on Wednesday night an amendment introduced by the
government to a new family draft bill, making divorce easier for
women.
</P>
<P>
The personal status draft law allows the wife to get divorced in
return for waiving all her financial entitlements from the
marriage, including dowry and other gifts from the husband, as well
as alimony.
</P>
<P>
Under the previous law, an Egyptian man can end his marriage
simply by filing a paper with the marriage registrar, while a woman
seeking divorce faced years of legal procedures.
</P>
<P>
The parliament rejected an article that would allow the wife to
travel without the consent of her husband, saying that Islamic
religious junctures give the husband the right to decide whether
his wife will travel or not.
</P>
<P>
The new law allows the couples involved in orfi (unofficial)
marriages to go to court for divorce.

in Cyprus and the possibility of giving some kind of recognition to
the breakaway regime in the northern area of the island.
</P>
<P>
Arriving at Larnaca airport, Tsohatzopoulos said "the
possibility of setting up a confederation in Cyprus cannot even be
up for discussion."
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos arrived here on a private visit to address a two-
day conference.
</P>
<P>
He said if Turkey wishes to be part of the world security
system, to accept United Nations decisions and walk down the path
towards Europe, it cannot insist on a confederation in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkey invaded and occupied the northern third of the island after
an abortive coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the U.N. has been trying to bring the two
communities together in a bizonal bicommuunal federation, but all
efforts have so far failed.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side, backed by Turkey, insists the
recognition of their breakaway regime in northern Cyprus, which was
recognized only by Ankara, and the establishment of a confederation
of two states on the island.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Greek-Turkish ties, Tsohatzopoulos said "
improvement of these relations will go hand in hand with Turkey's
adjustment to EU (European Union) norms."
</P>
<P>
He said Greece continues to guarantee Cyprus' security to allow
efforts for its EU accession and a political settlement proceed in
a peaceful climate.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Cyprus, Tsohatzopoulos will have separate
meetings with local political party leaders and will meet with
President Glafcos Clerides.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Woo Foreign Investment at Davos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit will make efforts to encourage foreign investment in Turkey
during his presence at the upcoming annual World Economic Forum
(WEF) at Davos, Switzerland, the Anatolia News Agency reported on
Thursday.

full load of project proposals. He will display 58 public sector
projects to potential foreign investors.

<P>
He is due to deliver to international business circles a 22-page
report which will provide an overview of the Turkish economy and

positive environment for foreign investment," said the report,
which was made available for the press in advance.
</P>
<P>
The report declared that Turkey plans to invest 30 billion U.S.
dollars over the next decade in the energy sector. "This will
provide an excellent opportunity for foreign investors who seek
economically sound projects in a stable environment," the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The report highlighted Turkey's massive privatization programs
and infrastructure projects of the private sector. The so-called
Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) model will be promoted in transport
and urban infrastructure investments, it noted.

diary during his three-day stay in Davos.
</P>

meeting with the Business Interaction Group, comprising investors
interested in Turkey. He is also expected to meet British Prime
Minister Tony Blair and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak among
others.
</P>
<P>

political and business leaders to discuss economic, financial and
technological trends and other issues of global importance.

<HEADLINE> Belgium's Regularization Period Not to be Extended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Belgian Home Affairs Minister
Tony Duquesne has decided that the regularization period in this
country will not be extended, local media reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The senate home affairs committee had asked the minister to
allow illegal immigrants to file an application for regularization
until midnight Sunday, but Mr. Duquesne said this would require a
change in Belgian law.
</P>
<P>
For nearly three weeks now, Belgium has been accepting requests
for regularization from illegal aliens who can show that they have
been staying in this country for some time.
</P>
<P>
The minister points to the extra staff that the municipalities
are receiving in order to process the requests. The senate
committee is worried about discrimination, because in some parts
of the country municipal services will be open all weekend.
Elsewhere offices close at noon Saturday.
</P>
<P>
So far, the number of illegal immigrants requesting
regularization has been far under expectations. In recent days
though municipalities across Belgium have been swamped by late
applications, the local reports said.
</P>
<P>
Belgium's anti-racism center suggests that in the big cities
municipal services will not be able to deal with the numbers.

BRUSSELS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Belgium and the human rights
groups still want to prevent Pinochet's release, local media said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Hith Court in London Wednesday examined a request from
Belgium and six human rights groups to force Britain to allow
further medical checks on Chile's former leader, General Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Belgium and the human rights groups are protesting against
secrecy surrounding the medical report from British doctors.
British Home Secretary Jack Straw is basing his possible decision
to release Pinochet on this report, which claims that Pinochet is
not fit to stand trial. The High Court ruling is still awaited.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian government has decided, however, not to take a case
to the court of human rights in The Hague if this procedure fails.
Belgian Foreign Minister Louis Michel has said he does not want a

<HEADLINE> World's Technology Pioneers to Meet in Davos for First Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, SWITZERLAND, January 27 (Xinhua) -- During this year's
annual meeting in Davos, the World Economic Forum (WEF) and
Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (DTT) will unveil a new program developed
especially for the world's fastest growing, most technologically
innovative companies, the WEF said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On January 31 and February 1, over 50 CEOs from the world's
leading pioneering technology companies, including Wipro Infotech
(India), Red Hat Software (USA), Africa Online (Kenya), TrustWorks
Systems (the Netherlands), DeCODE Genetics (Iceland), Autonomy (UK)
and Lernout &AMP;Hauspie (Belgium), will come together to discuss the
life lessons of managing rapid growth globally.
</P>
<P>
In a series of collaborative, informal meetings, they will
determine what key success factors are required to become a
technology pioneer, discuss common challenges and how to overcome
them, and share predictions of where technology is moving and how
it will impact the global economy. They will also meet such
veterans of the technological revolution as Yahoo!, Sun
Microsystems, Dell Computer Corporation, Novell and Vivendi.
</P>
<P>
"At a time of enormous technological change, it is important to
bring together companies that are shaping our future. It is key
for us to work together in engaging business in the global public
interest," commented WEF President and Founder Professor Klaus
Schwab, who is to host the awards dinner on January 31. "These
companies exemplify a new breed of corporate actors and we want to
help strengthen this community and incorporate it into our work."
</P>
<P>
The "Technology Pioneers" were selected according to two main
criteria: rate of growth and innovative power. Rate of growth is
based on three-year percentage revenue growth. The term "
innovative power" is based on in-house research and analysis from
the World Economic Forum, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and industry
experts.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Thomas Doorley, III, Senior Partner at Deloitte Touche
Tohmatsu, will lead the discussion on the key success factors as
well as summarize the findings of the two-day event. "These
companies really will be the leaders of the future, and
understanding their success is crucial. All present have some
interesting stories to tell and valuable insights to share, and it
is essential that the WEF is behind this important initiative,"
Doorley said.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu developed its annual "
Technology Fast 50 program"- a proprietary system for benchmarking
the fastest-growing technology companies using a common global
standard. The initial "Fast 50" ranking was developed for the US
market and grew into the "Technology Fast 500". More recently
Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu adapted this systematic method for other
countries around the world.

<HEADLINE> Greek Parliamentarians Call for Elian's Return to Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- About 40 Greek parliamentarians
Thursday called on the U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to help
end the ongoing tug of war between the United State and Cuba over
the six-year-old Elian Gonzalez to ensure that the child is
returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Annan, the Greek parliamentarians said that the
issue should be tackled within the context of humanitarian laws,
adding that their decision was reached on the basis of the
consideration of the child's "obvious need to return to his
natural family environment which, in the wake of the death of his
mother, will ensure the requisite emotional support."
</P>
<P>
The parliamentarians are members of the Greek Parliament's
Standing Committee on Defense and Foreign Affairs, and
representing the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK),
the main opposition New Democracy (ND), the Communist Party of
Greece (KKE), the Left Coalition and the Democratic Social
Movement.
</P>
<P>
Elian was picked up at sea off Florida last November, but his
mother drowned when a boat full of illegal Cuban immigrants
capsized.

<HEADLINE> Africa Regarded as Most Promising Market: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Sixty-two percent of
respondents have regarded African countries as the most promising
destination for new markets, a survey released on Thursday shows.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by the Johannesburg Chamber of
Commerce &AMP; Industry (JCCI). All the respondents are engaged in
export business in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Spokesperson for the chamber Dorothy Lotter said East Africa
appeared to hold great promise with Tanzania featured as the
favorite new market in this region, followed by Mozambique, Kenya
and Uganda. Mauritius, Madagascar and Ethiopia were the other
promising countries named in the survey.
</P>
<P>
West Africa was indicated as the area with the second most
potential, with both Ghana and Nigeria getting the thumbs up from
exporters.
</P>
<P>
Southern African Development Community (SADC) members such as
Zambia, Botswana and Namibia were also featured as new
destinations for export markets.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 57 percent of respondents said that
their exports last year increased by an average of 28 percent
compared with 1998.
</P>
<P>
JCCI said the increase in exports was attributed mainly to
expanding market share and finding new markets.

<HEADLINE> Globalization Should Benefit Developing Countries: Mbeki </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 27 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will stress
at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that
economic globalization should benefit the developing world,
President Thabo Mbeki said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters in Pretoria that the South African delegation
would highlight the impact of globalization on developing
countries, including those in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki and a number of Cabinet ministers were to leave for Davos
on Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that direct foreign investment tended to
go to countries which were already developed, adding that ways had
to be found to address the issue of international capital flows.
</P>
<P>
"A critical matter is to find ways and means by which this
globalizing economy impacts positively on the challenge of
development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Situations where rich countries were getting richer while the
poor ones got poorer should be avoided, he said.
</P>
<P>
"A process of globalization of that kind can only produce
disaster," Mbeki added.
</P>
<P>
South Africa will also convey a message of hope and confidence
to the forum so as to attract more investment, according to the
president.
</P>
<P>
"We will say that we are making good progress ... (and that)
the mood among our people in the country -- both black and white
-- is very good," Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa had been asked to address matters such as
 development in Africa, and why people should invest in the
continent. Mbeki said: "We have to try and communicate the
views, concerns, hopes and aspirations of the peoples of our
continent."
</P>
<P>
"We will want to encourage a vote of confidence by the
international business community in South Africa," he said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Diesel Shortage to Affect Crops Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The diesel crisis lasting about
two weeks in Zimbabwe is expected to cut the production of some
crops by about 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Soya beans have been heavily affected as we normally put the
crop in late January. We are now expecting a 50 percent or more
loss in production, " Director of the Indigenous Commercial
Farmers Union Nokwazi Moyo told the Zimbabwe News Agency on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said expected tobacco losses from fields to barns at present
stood at 20 percent but could be more if there were delays in
procuring fuel supplies.
</P>
<P>
"The transportation from fields to barns is extremely critical.
 If a farmer is down by one day, there is a big loss and the barns
won't be able to catch up," he said.
</P>
<P>
Diesel is used as a substitute for coal during the drying of
the crop in the barn, and a prolonged shortage during a time when
harvesting has begun can result in decreased production and
reduced foreign currency earnings.
</P>
<P>
Moyo said if electricity was rationed as threatened by the
Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority, farmers who depended on
irrigation would be further affected.
</P>
<P>
He said for those crops which were still being planted,
ploughing and seedbed preparation had been delayed or written off
in some places.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of diesel has also affected the horticultural
sector, preventing farmers from delivering their fresh produce to
the country's airports on time.
</P>
<P>
Director of Commercial Farmers Union David Hasluck said unless
the crisis was resolved by the end of this week, he foresees
substantial losses in foreign currency and in farmers' earnings.
</P>
<P>
In the 1999 marketing year, the sector earned about 100 million
U.S. dollars through the export of cut flowers.

LUANDA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- At least 14 passengers were

careened off a bridge and plunged into a river in central Angola,
local government officials said on Thursday.

Most Angolan hospitals have been suffering a chronic shortage
of medicines, as a result of the long-term civil war in the the
country.

Mechanical failures, bad state of the road and the excessive

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Revamp Diamond Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government is planning to scrap the Diamond Act and replace it
with new legislation governing the local diamond industry
incorporated into a new Minerals Development Bill.
</P>
<P>
The South African Press Association on Thursday quoted an
official from the Department of Minerals and Energy Affairs as
saying that one of the Department's priorities for 2000 would be
to revamp the structure of the South African diamond industry.
</P>
<P>
Briefing a gathering of Parliament's Committee on Mineral and
Energy Affairs, Ayanda Nkuhlu, secretary to the Minister of
Mineral and Energy Affairs, said : "In general the Department
will emerge with a more coherent strategy on diamonds, including
the future roles of the South African Diamond Board and the
Government Diamond Valuator."
</P>
<P>
Nkuhlu said the Department was currently overhauling both the
Minerals Act and the Diamond Act, to be replaced by a new Bill
that would be in line with the White Paper on Minerals.
</P>
<P>
Included in the new Bill, called the Minerals Development
Bill, would be the new provisions of the Diamond Act, legislation
on the transfer of mineral rights to the state, a new regulatory
regime for mining, and tax issues for the diamond and mining
industries.
</P>
<P>
The government also planned to lead a campaign to protect the
South African diamond industry from the growing threat of
international boycotts of diamonds as a result of diamonds linked
to support for rebels in areas of conflict.
</P>
<P>
"We will lead a campaign to protect the industry from
potential disruption and destruction," he revealed.
</P>
<P>
Nkuhlu also said Diamond giant De Beers would also have to
improve its "corporate citizenship" in order to retain its
privileges.
</P>
<P>
 De Beers would have to "exhibit greater corporate citizenship
in South Africa, as well as greater initiative in developing the
manufacturing industry in Southern Africa, and in black economic
empowerment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since last year De Beers has been challenged by the newly
appointed government diamond valuator, DVIC, on a range of issues
including export pricing, its exemption from export duty, and its
decision to move a stock of diamonds to London in 1993, ahead of
the first democratic elections.
</P>
<P>
A commission of inquiry into the diamond industry late last
year urged a widespread revamp of the system, including the
Diamond Act, which allows De Beers and Trans Hex, South Africa's
second largest diamond producer, to export rough diamonds free of
export duty on the condition that clients in South Africa are
supplied with sufficient diamonds.
</P>
<P>
The commission was appointed by the government as the result
of a long series of disputes between De Beers and DVIC over the
export prices of diamonds to the Central Selling Organization
(CSO) in London. This resulted in delays in diamond exports of
more than 6 months.

GAZA -- A senior Palestinian official denied an Israeli
newspaper report that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had
presented a proposal on the final peace with Israel during his

A report by the Israeli daily Ha'aretz claimed that PNA had

the West Bank and Gaza Strip in exchange for areas located within
the Green Line.
</P>

Arafat had asserted to Clinton on several occasions that the
building of settlements is illegitimate and poses a major obstacle
to peace-making, said the PNA official during an exclusive
interview with the Palestinian daily Alqods printed on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He also affirmed that the PNA is determined to establish an
independent Palestinian state on all territories occupied by
Israel during the two Middle East wars, including East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> British Judge to Rule on Pinochet Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- A British judge will rule on
next Monday whether the Belgian government and six human rights
groups can go to court to seek access to medical tests on former
Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
The judge told Belgian government and the human rights groups,
who are trying to seek a judicial review of the British government
's decision to keep secret a medical report on Pinochet, that he
would made the decision next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary Jack Straw has repeatedly said he will not
release the independent doctors' report on the grounds of normal
patient-doctor confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
Staw said the report shows Pinochet, 84, is not fit to be
extradited to Spain to face charges of torture.
</P>
<P>
A Home Office lawyer told the court that Straw had released
sufficient information to enable interested parties to make their
submissions.
</P>
<P>
He said Straw had assured Pinochet that the results of the
medical tests would be given only to the Home Secretary and the
Crown Prosecution Service.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was arrested in a London hospital in October 1998 at
the request of a Spanish judge who wanted to try him on torture
charges. Belgium and France followed up with extradition requests
of their own.

<HEADLINE> Vancouver Grizzlies Beat Utah Jazz 116-99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- For one night, the Vancouver
Grizzlies looked like they had been beating the Utah Jazz for
years.
</P>
<P>
Shareef Abdur-Rahim scored 30 points and Mike Bibby had 28 and
11 assists as Vancouver posted its first win against Utah,
cruising to a 116-99 rout in what easily was the most surprising
result of the NBA season.
</P>
<P>
The Grizzlies had lost all 17 previous meetings with Utah by an
average of 13.9 points since entering the league in 1995 and were
winless in nine visits to the Delta Center. But they ran roughshod
over the Jazz last night.
</P>
<P>
Vancouver held a 55-43 lead at half-time but rather than
pulling their usual second-half collapse, the Grizzlies extended
the advantage to 88-71 entering the final period. Utah never made
a serious run and pulled its starters midway through the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Karl Malone managed a season-low 13 points on 5-of-12 shooting
for Utah, which suffered an embarrassing letdown after a thrilling
double-overtime win over the league-leading Los Angeles Lakers on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Bryon Russell scored 16 points, Howard Eisley had 12 and rookie
Quincy Lewis added 11 for Utah, which shot 49 percent (38-of-77)
and lost the battle on the boards, 39-31.

<HEADLINE> One Company Per 13 People in HKSAR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) has one of the highest ratios of
companies to the population in the world with one company for
every 13 people, Gordon Jones, HKSAR's Registrar of Companies,
said today.
</P>
<P>
As at 1 January, 2000, there were 490,888 registered companies
in the HKSAR, of which 6,058 were public and 484,830 were private.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the annual dinner of the Hong Kong Institute of
Company Secretaries, Jones said the Companies Registry at present
takes only six working days on average to incorporate a company
and the time is expected to be further shortened.
</P>
<P>
"We envisage drastic streamlining of the incorporation process.
A specified form for application for incorporation will be
introduced and it will be possible to incorporate companies
electronically," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jones said there will be many momentous developments and
changes which would have a profound impact on the way the
Companies Registry operates.
</P>
<P>
"The Registry's expanded database will be made available on-
line early this year through the Companies Registry On-line Public
Search System," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Strategic Change Plan of the Companies Registry
envisages a fully electronic registry by 2005 with electronic
filing, processing and dissemination of information.
</P>
<P>
The Companies (Amendment) Bill 2000, which received its first
and adjourned second readings in the Legislative Council on
January 19, contains a number of reform measures, which, if
enacted, will "significantly help to simplify and streamline the
regulatory regime without lowering corporate governance standards,
" Jones said.
</P>
<P>
There would be a number of significant developments regarding
company law reform and corporate governance this year, said Jones.
</P>
<P>
These include the publication of the report by the Standing
Committee on Company Law Reform on the overall review of the
Companies Ordinance and a study by the Standing Committee of
corporate governance.

<HEADLINE> Dardanelles Bridge Project Off the Shelf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- A plan to construct a bridge over
the Dardanelles, long shelved due to lack of funds, has come under
reconsideration, reported the Anatolia News Agency on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The General Directorate of Roads has prepared for negotiations
with local and international construction companies to revitalize
the construction process of the 400 million U.S. dollar project.
</P>
<P>
The Bosporus and Dardanelles Straits are the strategic passage
between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. Two bridges linking
the City of Istanbul's two parts of Europe and Asia were built in
1973 and 1998 respectively.
</P>
<P>
A third bridge was needed to alleviate the heavy traffic across
the straits. The projected Dardanelles bridge will be the first
overpass above the sea lane.
</P>
<P>
The directorate announced that it favors the so-called build-
operate-transfer (BOT) system for the project.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the Ministry of Housing and Public Works
have disclosed that a number of foreign construction firms, mainly
from Spain, Britain and Japan, have shown interest in the huge
project.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that they are currently concentrating on the
feasibility studies of two methods of raising the required funds
for the bridge, but they prefer the BOT model for, as they see it,
the system is more appropriate than foreign credit.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary negotiations with both local and foreign
contractors, who are included on the prospective bidders list, will
soon begin and a decision will be made subsequently on the choice
of the funding methods.

<HEADLINE> Barak's Party Faces Criminal Probe over Fund- raising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Attorney General
Eliyakim Rubinstein ordered Thursday to open criminal investigation
against Prime Minister Ehud Barak's One Israel coalition over
alleged fund-raising violations in last year's elections.
</P>
<P>
Rubinstein took this action immediately after the State
Comptroller Eliezer Goldberg said that he believed Barak and his
One Israel ruling coalition are major violators of campaign
financing law in the 1999 elections, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Goldberg submitted his widely expected report on party
funding to Deputy Knesset (Parliament) Speaker Naomi Chazan, since
Speaker Avraham Burg is in Sweden to attend the international
conference on the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Barak and his close associates,
including his brother-in-law Doron Cohen and cabinet secretary
Yitzhak Herzog, used a variety of so-called non-profit
organizations (NPOs) to channel large sums of money from foreign
donors to fund Barak's election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Goldberg asserted in his report that such campaign contributions
are illegal under the campaign financing law. Thus, he imposed One
Israel coalition a heavy fine of 13.7 million shekels (about 3.5
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
But some officials of the Labor Party, the backbone of the
coalition, argued that Barak only took advantage of a loophole in
the law at most and there is nothing wrong in that.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1973 Party Financing Law, money to fund election
campaigns must come from coffers. No foreign donations are
permitted, and Israeli individuals may only contribute no more than
1,700 shekels (about 430 dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel's electoral system changed in 1996, when a new
system of direct elections for the premiership was introduced. But
the wording of the campaign financing law was not changed to
address personal campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Thus both candidates for prime minister in 1996, Shimon Peres
and Benjamin Netanyahu, established NPOs to fund their campaigns.
In the 1999 elections, Barak and Netanyahu also use the same
tactics.
</P>
<P>
Labor party officials also pointed out that Rubinstein wrote in
a judicial review letter in 1996 that there was "a problem in the
interpretation of the (Party Financing) Law as to whether (it)
applied to the candidate for prime minister."
</P>
<P>
Although Rubinstein had changed his viewpoints on the subject
last August, some Labor officials said his judgement should not be
applied retroactively to the elections held in the spring last
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some political analysts worried that at a critical
point of Middle East peace process, any embarrassment in the fund-
raising saga will do damage to Barak's peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
Analysts also pointed out that President Ezer Weizman, who was
committed to supporting peace talks with Arab countries, also faces
already-launched criminal investigation over his alleged finance
improprieties with French millionaire Edouard Saroussi.
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sarah are
also being investigated over suspicions that they illegally kept
gifts belonging to the state.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, for the first time in Israel's history, a president,
a prime minister and a former prime minister are facing criminal
investigations at the same time.

<P>
COLOMBO, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Eight people were killed and 73
others wounded on Thursday when a powerful bomb ripped through the
main post office in the northern Sri Lankan town of Vavuniya, the
Defense Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
"A claymore mine type bomb placed underneath the outgoing
foreign letter box had exploded around 11:20 a.m. (0520 GMT) today
" in Vavuniya, about 260 kilometers north the capital of Colombo,
said the ministry in a detailed statement on the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Of the eight dead persons, there are three civilians and three
soldiers while the other two have not been identified yet, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said the wounded included 57 civilians, eight soldiers and
eight policemen.
</P>
<P>
Of the 73 wounded persons, except for 15, all others have been
evacuated to Anuradhapura Hospital for treatment, the statement
added.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry said earlier in a statement that the bomb
explosion had killed 10 persons and wounded 12 soldiers, 7 police
personnel and 20 civilians.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the soldiers were at the post office to send
money to their families in the south of Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The bombing came despite tight security throughout the country
amid fears of more bomb attacks by the separatist Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels who are fighting for an
independent homeland for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and
east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The bomb attacks have been the trademark of the LTTE rebels who
are blamed a series of suicide bomb attacks in recent weeks
against President Chandrika Kumaratunga and other senior officials.

<HEADLINE> Appellate Court's Decision Not Yet Final: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Thursday that he will consult with government lawyers
on how to respond to a court decision prohibiting the spray-
painting of drug dealers' houses, Philippine News Agency (PNA)
said.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Estrada, who is in ILOILO city, Visayas, for
an inspection, as saying that the matter is not yet final, and
that the Presidential Palace still has the option to file a motion
for reconsideration.
</P>
<P>
"We will consult first with our presidential legal counsel,
Magdangal Elma. That's not final anyway. We can still file a
motion for reconsideration," he said.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the country's Court of Appeals branded as
unconstitutional the spray painting campaign against drug dealers
in the city of Manila.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Alfredo Lim of the Department of Interior and Local
Government is heading the drive aimed at saving the youth from
falling prey to drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
Estrada has declared an all-out war against the prohibited drug
trade which, he said, destroys the future of the country's young
people.
</P>
<P>
The president said his administration will undertake all
measures within the bounds of the law to stamp out the drug
scourge.
</P>
<P>
However, the court said the "scarlet letter" drive is violative
of one of the fundamental guarantees established in the
Constitution that all accused shall be presumed innocent until the
contrary is proved.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the appellate court said the appropriate and legal
course of action is to charge, arrest and prosecute suspected drug
traffickers.

<P>
BANGKOK, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Tense situation persisted
Thursday in the western Thai province of Ratchaburi as a result of
the hostage drama earlier this week, the official Thai News Agency
(TNA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a group of 10 armed Myanmar ethnic rebels seized a
hospital in Ratchaburi town and took more than 500 medical staff,
patients and visitors hostage for 22 hours before Thai commandos
stormed the hospital, killing all the 10 rebels and rescuing all
the hostages on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Police in the provincial town, some 120 kilometers west of
Bangkok, said anonymous callers had made bomb threats against a
different hospital, a kindergarten and a department store on
Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, explosive experts searched these places found no bombs.
</P>
<P>
Parents rushed to take their children from schools which were
just opened Thursday after being closed for three days since the
hostage crisis began.
</P>
<P>
Authorities had ordered schools in Ratchaburi province to be
closed again until next Monday, according to TNA.
</P>
<P>
Thai officials and civilians have feared revenge attacks after
the Thai commandos killed the 10 rebels, some from the ethnic
Karen rebel group God's Army and the others from the so-called
Vigorous Burmese Student Warriors.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports that a God's Army base in the Myanmar
side of the border has been overrun by the Myanmar government

<HEADLINE> U.S. Durable-Goods Orders Rise Sharply in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported Thursday that orders for
durable goods rose 4.1 percent last month, the biggest increase
since July, to a seasonally adjusted 212.9 billion dollars. That
followed a one percent gain in November.
</P>
<P>
For 1999, orders for durable goods, including items from air
conditioners to airplanes, jumped 7.1 percent, matching the
increase posted in 1997 and far surpassing 3.6 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In December, orders for transportation equipment rose a huge 16.
2 percent, led by strong demand for airplanes and aircraft parts,
although gains were reported across the board. The surge was the
largest increase since August 1998.
</P>
<P>
Transportation often is volatile from month to month because it
includes such big-ticket purchases as airplanes. Excluding
transportation, overall orders grew by 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Also, a 4.6 percent jump in orders for electronic and other
electrical equipment including semiconductors, circuit boards,
telecommunications equipment and home appliances also contributed
to the big gain in overall durable-goods orders in December.
</P>
<P>
However, orders for industrial machinery, including computers
and machine tools dropped 4.2 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that orders for primary metals, the category
including steel, fell 1.5 percent in December. This category has
been down four of the last five months.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of big-ticket durable goods, a good signal of current
demand, also rose 0.7 percent in December, the seventh increase in
the last eight months.

<P>
NAIROBI, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi received the credentials from the incoming Nigerian High
Commissioner to Kenya Fidelis Naanmiap Tapgu at the State House
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Moi said that Kenya and Nigeria have had close relations and
shared identical views on various continental and international
issues.
</P>
<P>
He noted that what is worrying most are the conflicts that have
 bedeviled the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Moi said that leaders in Africa should pose and reflect whether
the struggle for independence was to be used by Africans to fight
among themselves, according to a release from the Presidential
Press Services.
</P>
<P>
A way should be found to change the current influx of arms into
the continent, adding that the proliferation of arms in the
continent has created insecurity in parts of the continent, he
said.

<HEADLINE> EU Must Promote Economic Reforms: EC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) must
speed up its economic reforms in order to develop a dynamic,
integrated and efficient market and fully respect member states'
social goals, the European Commission (EC) said in a report
released here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The EC, the executive body of the 15-member EU, said today's
broadly favorable global economic climate offers Europe a golden
opportunity to enhance durable economic growth and employment by
raising its overall competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The report uses quantitative assessments of the performance of
Europe's product and capital markets to identify where regulatory
and structural reforms are most urgent. It also outlines some
measures to reduce market fragmentation.
</P>
<P>
"Economic reform requires reinforcement of the internal market
as the cornerstone for the EU's micro-economic policies," said
Frederik Bolkestein, European Commissioner for the Internal Market.
</P>
<P>
"Despite significant improvements in the past few years, the
European market remains too fragmented, especially in the service
sector. We must build a dynamic business environment where
entreprenurship can turn technological and investment
opportunities into new jobs," he said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Defense Minister Predicts Breakthrough in Grozny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev said Thursday that federal troops will soon achieve a
breakthrough in their attempt to capture the Chechen capital
Grozny.
</P>
<P>
"A breakthrough is looming in the Grozny operation," the
Interfax news agency quoted Sergeyev as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Despite losses among attack groups in Grozny, the rebel
losses very much exceed ours. We are taking measures to minimize
our losses," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian military said earlier this week that more than 1,
100 federal servicemen have died in fighting against rebels in
Chechnya and neighboring Daghestan, which came under rebel
incursions last August.
</P>
<P>
Moscow put the number of rebel deaths at around 10,000.
</P>
<P>
Besides the campaign to capture Grozny, federal troops are
also moving to root out rebels in the southern regions of the
breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
"The speedy action of the army's movement in a southeastern
direction is bringing about the conditions for a successful end to
the operation in Grozny," Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters of the federal forces in the North Caucasus
said Thursday that fighting is especially relentless in the area
of the strategic Minutka square of Grozny. Artillery and tanks
are shelling the upper floors and roofs of tall buildings in the
neighboring streets where rebel snipers are positioned.
</P>
<P>
Rebels continue holding positions near Yuzhnaya bus station,
500 meters to the east of Minutka, Interfax said, noting continued
fighting in Leninsky and Oktyabrky districts of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
Rebels are maintaining dogged resistance and skillfully using
underground passages and pipelines for raids into the rear of
advance federal formations, the headquarters said.
</P>
<P>
Despite poor weather, federal aircraft continued their bombing
raids on rebel positions in Grozny and the southern mountains.
</P>
<P>
Sukhoi-24 front-line bombers, Sukhoi-25 attack aircraft, and
Mi-24 helicopter gunships made over 100 combat missions Thursday,
Interfax said, citing federal headquarters.

<HEADLINE> World Economic Forum to Open 30th Annual Meeting in Davos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, Switzerland, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Some 3,000 global
leaders in the fields of politics, business, civil society,
academics and media will meet Thursday in the eastern Swiss town
of Davos to discuss world economic development in the new century.
</P>
<P>
With "New Beginnings: Making a Difference" as this year's theme,
the 30th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) will
mark the first international gathering of the 21st century, said
the Geneva-based non-profit organization.
</P>
<P>
"New realities are radically changing almost every domain of
human activity. The compounding forces of globalization,
technological and biological revolution, and the emerging e-
commerce confront us with a challenge of unprecedented magnitude
in modern history," WEF's Managing Director Claude Smadja said at
the eve of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting will be "a unique opportunity" to "set the
tone" in addressing the new economic, technological, social and
geopolitical realities of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will focus on the following topics: environment,
education; social values; the Internet economy, new technologies
and inclusiveness; new business models and new economic rules;
asserting peace imperatives for the 21st century and civil
conflicts; the role of business, government and civil society;
constructing a healthy policy in a unipolar world; maintaining
personal balance in an ever more complicated world; and the
challenge of managing diversity in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Klaus Schwab, WEF president and also founder of the
organization, called for the establishment of flexible networks,
which can put together governments, international organizations
and business to review new issues on the global agenda.
</P>
<P>
The WEF, founded in 1971, aims to serve its members and society
by creating the foremost global partnership of business, political,
intellectual and other leaders of society to define and discuss
key issues on the global agenda.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Increase Defense Spending by 50 Percent in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian Acting President
Vladimir Putin announced Thursday that government defense
contracts will be raised by 50 percent this year as compared with
1999.
</P>
<P>
Putin told a cabinet meeting that the developments in the
North Caucasus were not the only reason for the spending increase.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is much deeper," he said, "The army has been
underpaid for several years which has had a certain impact on
defense capability and in the socioeconomic sphere."
</P>
<P>
The chances of Russia having an effective modern army armed
with the latest weaponry have become questionable, Putin said.
</P>
<P>
He said the potential of the military-industrial complex has
remained and that the personnel in the defense industry have been
preserved, although the belief that the defense industry will
become the locomotive of the economy did not materialize.
</P>
<P>
Putin called for a program of action to advance the military-
industrial complex, noting the 30 percent increase in the output
of high-tech civilian goods by the sector, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, who is in charge of the
defense industry, said 80 percent more capital will go to arms
research and development in 2000.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that in 1999 defense contracts were paid for only
50-60 percent.
</P>
<P>
"But for the developments in Chechnya, we would have been able
to pay for the contracts 100 percent," Klebanov said.
</P>
<P>
He said all arrears for the 1999 defense contracts would be
paid in the first quarter of this year and the arrears for the
1997-1998 contracts by the end of April. All debts that
accumulated in the 1990's would be paid in the next two-three
years.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Ruling Parties Approve Seat-Reduction Bill in Lower House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Japan's House of Representatives
Thursday approved a bill to reduce the number of proportional
representation seats in the lower house in a vote at a plenary
session that was boycotted by the opposition camp.
</P>
<P>
The lower house passed the bill which was backed by the ruling
coalition formed by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the
Liberal Party LP), and the New Komeito.
</P>
<P>
Legislators from Japan's main opposition parties, the
Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), the Japanese Communist Party (SDP)
, and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) stayed away from the Diet
(parliament) proceedings to protest what they called the
coalition's bulldozing of the bill.
</P>
<P>
After the approval of the bill, the opposition parties vowed to
continue to boycott all Diet sessions, including Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi's policy speech at Friday's plenary sessions in both
Diet chambers, and deliberations on the fiscal 2000 budget.
</P>
<P>
The opposition bloc has been boycotting Diet sessions since
Wednesday morning, when the ruling parties held a debate on the
bill at a lower house committee, which passed the bill Wednesday
afternoon in the absence of opposition legislators.
</P>
<P>
If the all-out confrontation continues, Obuchi may opt to
dissolve the lower house for a general election, especially after
the enactment of the budget, political analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The controversial bill, which will cut 20 of the 200
proportional representation seats from the 500-seat lower chamber,
has been submitted to the House of Councilors (upper house).
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Party, which sees the reduction as part of its
political reform plan, has threatened to quit the ruling camp
unless the bill is enacted at the onset of the current Diet
session, which began on January 21.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Durable-Goods Orders Rise Sharply in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. orders for durable
goods soared in December, pushed by the biggest demand for
airplanes and other transportation equipment in more than a year.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported Thursday that orders for
durable goods rose 4.1 percent last month, the biggest increase
since July, to a seasonally adjusted 212.9 billion dollars. That
followed a 1 percent gain in November.
</P>
<P>
For 1999, orders for durable goods, including items from air
conditioners to airplanes, jumped 7.1 percent, matching the
increase posted in 1997 and far surpassing 3.6 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In December, orders for transportation equipment rose a huge 16.
2 percent, led by strong demand for airplanes and aircraft parts,
although gains were reported across the board. The surge was the
largest increase since August 1998.
</P>
<P>
Transportation often is volatile from month to month because it
includes such big-ticket purchases as airplanes. Excluding
transportation, overall orders grew by 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Also, a 4.6 percent jump in orders for electronic and other
electrical equipment including semiconductors, circuit boards,
telecommunications equipment and home appliances also contributed
to the big gain in overall durable-goods orders in December.
</P>
<P>
However, orders for industrial machinery, including computers
and machine tools dropped 4.2 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that orders for primary metals, the category
including steel, fell 1.5 percent in December. This category has
been down four of the last five months.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of big-ticket durable goods, a good signal of current
demand, also rose 0.7 percent in December, the seventh increase in
the last eight months.

<HEADLINE> Bangkok Ready for Bidding 2008 Olympics: Deputy Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Bangkok is ready in terms of
finance and infrastructure to made a bid for the 29th Olympic
Games in 2008, Deputy Governor Theerachai Wuthitham was quoted by
local TV stations Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Theerachai said the city had already prepared financial and
infrastructure plans to make the city a potential candidate to
compete with Beijing, Osaka, Paris, Toronto, Istanbul, Seville,
and Havana for the staging of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The Thai cabinet Tuesday approved the Olympic Committee of
Thailand (OCT)'s proposal of bidding for the 2008 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The government made a deal with Bangkok that both would pay the
82 million baht (2.19 million U.S. dollar) expenses required for
the advertising campaign before the five final candidate cities
are announced in September.
</P>
<P>
If selected as one of the finalists, the country would have to
spend another 441 million baht (11.8 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Both the government and the city would have to shoulder the
responsibility of raising the money, which would be spent on the
second promotion campaign until the winner is announced in July
2001.
</P>
<P>
Theerachai also said that the city is expected to spend five
billion baht (133.8 million dollars) a year to prepare for the
Olympics should it be granted the right to host the Games.
</P>
<P>
He added that Bangkok is developing its infrastructure and
transportation system, including the construction of elevated
roads and subway trains.
</P>
<P>
Theerachai emphasized that the large amount spent on the
bidding for the Games would not be wasted even if the country did
not win the right because Thailand will benefit from a recovered
foreign investor confidence as a result of the bidding and a
boosted local tourism industry thanks to the first-stage
advertising campaign.

<HEADLINE> Macao Seminar Urges Taiwan's Reunification with Motherland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Participants in a seminar held
here this afternoon said that the Taiwan question cannot drag on
with indefinite duration and the tide of Taiwan's reunification
with the motherland is irresistible.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was held to mark the fifth anniversary of an eight-
point proposal made by Chinese President Jiang Zemin on the
resolution of the Taiwan question. More than 80 people from
various social sectors in Macao took part in the seminar.
</P>
<P>
About a dozen participants delivered speeches. They noted that
Jiang's eight-point proposal is the actual practice and
development of Deng Xiaoping's "peaceful reunification, one
country, two systems" concept, and is the guiding principle for
reasonably resolving the Taiwan question at the current situation.
</P>
<P>
The successful resolution of the Hong Kong and Macao issues
makes the Taiwan question more outstanding, the speakers said,
adding that the principles of "one country, two systems" and a
high degree of autonomy in Hong Kong and Macao will surely play an
exemplary role for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Following its return to the motherland, Macao will maintain its
unique role as a bridge between the two sides of the Taiwan
Straits, and will contribute more to promoting the development of
cross-Straits relations and the resolution of the Taiwan question,
the participants said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Wednesday that he
expects "a marathon round of brainstorming talks" with the
Palestinians to begin next week, and the resumption of the talks
with Syria in "the coming weeks".
</P>
<P>
Barak, in Stockholm for a conference on Holocaust education,
also said that, in principle, Israel cannot accept "moral, legal,
or other responsibility" for Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The political establishment was gearing up for battle
Wednesday night, on the eve of the release of the state
comptroller's report on the non-profit organizations that assisted
the parties and the candidates for prime minister in the 1999
election by allegedly tunneling illegal fund.
</P>
<P>
Copies of the report circulated freely Wednesday among
parliamentarians from the coalition and the opposition as well as
in government ministries, but its content is barred to be published
by media until 1 P.M. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Both the ruling One Israel coalition and the opposition Likud
Party professed to be satisfied with the document's contents.
However, the Likud contends there will be no choice but to launch a
criminal investigation against those involved, perhaps even against
Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Local authorities across the country Wednesday night
continued preparing for the expected stormy weather forecast for
Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
Snow is expected at elevations higher than 400 meters, including
Jerusalem and the Negev. No snow is expected along the coastal
plain, and earlier predictions of the snow hitting Tel Aviv have
been dropped.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel will recall its ambassador to Vienna for consultations
and reconsider its relations with Austria, if extreme right-wing
leader Joerg Heider joins Austria's government, Foreign Minister
David Levy said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Austria's Chancellor Viktor Klima pledged that he would
not form a coalition with Haider's Freedom Party. Thus, political
analysts say that Klima's chances of forming a majority coalition
are slim.

<HEADLINE> Dardanelles Overpass Project in Turkey Under Reconsideration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The government of Turkey is
reconsidering a plan to build the first overpass over the
Dardanelles Strait, which was put on the shelf due to a lack of
funds, the Anatolia News Agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The General Directorate of Roads has been preparing for
negotiations with local and international construction companies to
revitalize the construction process of the 400-million-U.S.-dollar
project.
</P>
<P>
The directorate announced that it favors the build-operate-
transfer (BOT) system for the project, which is seen as more
appropriate than foreign credit.
</P>
<P>
A number of foreign construction firms, mainly from Spain,
Britain and Japan, have shown interest in the mega project, said
officials with the Ministry of Public Works and Housing.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is currently working on the feasibility studies of
the two methods of raising the required funds for the bridge.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary negotiations with local and foreign contractors,
which are listed as prospective bidders, will soon begin and a
decision will be made concerning the fund-raising methods.
</P>
<P>
The Bosporus and Dardanelles Straits are two strategic passages
between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. Two bridges linking
Istanbul's European and Asian parts were built in 1973 and 1998
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The projected Dardanelles bridge will be the first overpass
above the sea lane, said the report.

<HEADLINE> UAE Launches Clean-Up Following Oil Spill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
has mobilized a 100-strong team of municipality workers to clean up
coastal areas of Abu Dhabi polluted by the oil slick from the ship
Al Jazya 1 which sank on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Oil which had leaked from the Honduran-flagged ship was found to
have come ashore on the beaches of some small islands in the
emirate, local media reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The situation on the beaches will be assessed before a decision
can be made as to whether a specialist private company should be
brought in to help the clean-up efforts, Hamad Abdul Rahman Al-
Madfa, chairman of the United Arab Emirates Federal Environmental
Agency(FEA), told the Gulf News daily.
</P>
<P>
There are reports that oiled waders have been discovered on the
affected islands, and officials have also expressed fears that the
clean-up operation can have a damaging effect on historic and
archaeological sites in the oil-affected area, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The ship, run by an Abu Dhabi-based company, sank about 11.3
kilometers off east of Abu Dhabi coast while sailing from Abu Dhabi
to Somalia laden with 980 tons of heavy fuel.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed specialist company has begun to pump out the
remaining oil on the vessel, refloat the ship and tow it to port
under official authorization, the FEA chairman said.
</P>
<P>
At least 200-300 tons of oil had spilled from the ship before
the leaks were fully closed.
</P>
<P>
Coast guard officials suggested that overload and bad weather
might be the cause of the capsize of the ship.
</P>
<P>
Other officials suggest that the ill-fated tanker was operating
illegally in UAE waters when it sank.
</P>
<P>
The eight crew members and the captain of the vessel have been
safely rescued and are currently in police custody, Gulf News said.
The crew are a mixture of Iraqis, Indians, Bangladeshis and
Tanzanians, it added.

<P>
NICOSIA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Parties of Greek and Turkish
Cypriots will meet on each other's home ground for the first time
next month, the Cyrus Mail newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
One meeting will be held on the Greek Cypriot side on February
16 and the other on the Turkish Cypriot side on February 17.
</P>
<P>
Deputies to take part in the meeting from the Greek Cypriot side
include leader of the governing Democratic Rally party Nicos
Anastassiades, Andreas Phillipou from the communist AKEL party,
Stathis Kittis from Democratic Party, Doros Theodorou from the
socialist EDEK party and Androulla Vassiliou from the United
Democrats party.
</P>
<P>
The party leaders of the two sides held meetings on and off at
the U.N.-controlled Ledra Palace, at buffer zone in central
Nicosia, in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Previous meetings between the parties were held at the Ledra
Palace under the auspices of the Czech and Slovak embassies, but
ground to a halt after 1997, when the Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash cut off bicommunal contact in retaliation for the European
Union's rejection of Turkey's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.

which have been closed since January 16 as a result of the strike,
are set to open Friday, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Some 85,000 teachers have taken part in the strike, which has
affected about one million students.
</P>
<P>
The teachers had demanded a 15 percent compensation for erosion
of their salaries since 1994, or a total package of 1.8 billion
shekels(about 450 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Treasury, however, had stuck to its plan for a 1.2 percent
increase plus a one-time payment of 900 shekels (about 225 U.S.
dollars).

<HEADLINE> PNA Denies Israeli Report on Peace Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
denied an Israeli newspaper report that Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat had presented a proposal on the final peace with Israel
during his meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton last week.
</P>
<P>
A report by the Israeli daily Ha'aretz claimed that PNA had
proposed to accept the Israeli annexation of Jewish settlements in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip in exchange for areas located within
the Green Line.
</P>
<P>
Arafat had asserted to Clinton on several occasions that the
building of settlements is illegitimate and poses a major obstacle
to peace-making, said the PNA official during an exclusive
interview with the Palestinian daily Alqods printed on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He also affirmed that the PNA is determined to establish an
independent Palestinian state on all territories occupied by Israel
during the two Middle East wars, including East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian chief negotiator in the final-status
talks Yasser Abed Rabbo dismissed the report as "Israeli test
balloons."
</P>
<P>
"I have never offered such proposals" and what was published in
Ha'aretz "is fully untrue and entirely fabricated," said the
negotiating chief.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Abed Rabbo agreed on Wednesday evening
with his Israeli counterpart Oded Eran in west Jerusalem that
marathon negotiations should start next Sunday and last until
February 13 to reach a framework agreement on the final-status
issues.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed that such negotiations should be
conducted extensively and profoundly in order to meet the February
13 deadline under the Sharm el Sheikh memorandum signed last
September.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side wanted the negotiations to be held in
Washington in early February, an idea rejected by the Israeli side
for fear of any American intervention in the talks.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia for More Stable Global Financial System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said Thursday
Asian countries should continue to pursue their call for an
improved and more stable global financial system that would ensure
a safer world for cross-border flows.
</P>
<P>
"We urge Southeast Asian Central Bank Governors Conference
economies to persist in efforts to ensure reforms to the
international financial architecture," Malaysian Finance Minister
Daim Zainuddin said while officiating the 25th Southeast Asian
Central Bank Governors Conference (SEACEN) here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said that these reforms are necessary given the fundamental
weaknesses of the free market system, the inherent instability of
the international financial system and the need to ensure that all
economies are protected from the manipulative activities of
currency traders and highly leveraged hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
The minister regretted that not much progress has been made in
implementing the reforms because much of the debate on these
issues continue to be dominated by a small and closed group of
countries, namely, the group of seven industrialized (G-7)
countries.
</P>
<P>
"There is a need to ensure that the views and concerns of small
economies are given due consideration as these economies are more
vulnerable to the destabilizing effects of massive and volatile
short term capital flows," Daim said.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, I believe that SEACEN as a group can play an
important role in mobilizing the support of developing countries,
as a common stance will strengthen our influence on decisions on
international financial architecture issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said crisis-hit Asian countries cannot be overly dependent
on the developed nations as a source of recovery and growth given
the prevailing uncertainty in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
"To ensure uninterrupted and steady growth, we need to prepare
to be economically more resilient to better manage the vagaries of
external developments," the Malaysian minister said.
</P>
<P>
The countries could begin by building regional economic
resilience to enhance their efforts to effectively manage economic
uncertainty by expanding the scope and pace of regional
cooperation, he said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Krung Bank to Bring NPLs Down to 40 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Krung Thai Bank, Thailand's
state-owned commercial bank, expects to restructure 170 billion
baht(4.55 billion U.S. dollars) in loan this year, bring the non-
performing loans (NPLs) down to 40 percent of total loans, the
Bangkok Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the bank, the second largest commercial bank in
Thailand,resolved problems for borrowings totaling 127 billion
baht (3.39 billion dollars), exceeding its target by 20 percent,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok Post quoted Dusit Tengniyom, the bank's senior
executive vice-president, as saying that the bank restructured
loans for more than 21,000 customers in 1999, adding that the
greatest progress was made in the fourth quarter when 71.6 billion
baht (1.91 billion dollars) in loans were restructured and the
bank's NPLs were at 57 percent of total loans, or 590 billion baht
(15.7 billion dollars) at the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Another 780 customers with loans of 13.65 billion baht (365.2
million dollars) are ready to sign restructuring contracts,
according to the bank official.
</P>
<P>
If restructuring goes according to plan, the bank's NPLs could
fall to 40 percent of total outstanding loans by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Plans to set up an asset management company are likely to
further bring down the NPL level.

<HEADLINE> Pensions in New Zealand Raised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Superannuitants are to
receive a big pay rise after the New Zealand government made a
formal announcement of increasing pensions here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the new policy, a married couple will receive another 21.
42 NZ dollars (about 11 U.S. dollars) a week and single people
approximately 12.5 NZ dollars (about 6.4 U.S. dollars) from April
1.
</P>
<P>
While making the announcement, New Zealand Finance Minister
Michael Cullen said the increase fulfills election pledges from
the Labor Party and its coalition partner the Alliance.
</P>
<P>
As of April 1, the married rate for New Zealand Superannuation
and for the Veterans' Pension will increase from 325.58 NZ dollars
(166 U.S. dollars) to 347 NZ dollars (177 U.S. dollars) a week.
The single living alone rate and the single sharing rate are
calculated at 65 percent and 60 percent of the married rate.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the new government will spend an extra 700
million NZ dollars (357 million U.S. dollars) on state pensions
over the next four years. Extra government spending will be funded
by higher taxes for people earning more than 60,000 NZ dollars (30,
600 U.S. dollars) a year and an expected economic recovery
boosting tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
The increase will please superannuitants angry about the former
government last year lowering the "floor" for calculating the
married, or base rate. Under that policy, the base rate was
gradually dropping from 65 percent of the average wage for a
normal working week to 60 percent. Pensions would be adjusted only
for inflation until the floor was reached.
</P>
<P>
The base rate is currently 62.6 percent of the average wage and
would have fallen further on April 1. However, after the new
government's policy, that percentage will rise to about 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
"For as long as it is over 65 percent, it will be adjusted for
inflation only. But it will never be allowed to sink below 65
percent again under this government. That is our undertaking to
the New Zealand public," the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Foreign Policy to Face Challenge in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's foreign policy in
the year 2000 will still face challenges, but enjoy full support
from the international community in dealing with domestic problems,
Indonesian Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the Indonesian government had also taken
steps in a bid to strengthen its bilateral ties with countries of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nation (ASEAN) and some other
Asian countries such as China, India and Japan.
</P>
<P>
These countries will play a significant role, besides Western
countries, in creating a fair world economic order, the minister
said in an annual press gathering to review Indonesia's foreign
policy in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The minister predicted that the development of the world
politics in 2000 would feature democratization, good governance
and environment issues.
</P>
<P>
"And the relationship among countries (in the 21st century)
would show more interdependence," Shihab said, adding that
Indonesia's ties with Middle East countries would be better and
better particularly in economic and trade sectors in the new
century.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to See GDP Growth in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Financial services firm
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter said Thursday that Malaysia's gross
domestic product (GDP) is forecast to grow between 5.5 percent and
6.5 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's economy is also forecast to perform well with its
trade accounts of more than one-and-a half times its entire
economy,Faisal Mian, its London-based vice-president for fixed
income sovereign research, said at a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
The forecast is in line with the rosy outlook of the global
economy which Morgan Stanley anticipated would grow by 4 percent
this year while the World Trade Organization (WTO) procedure to
promote trade is expected to go well, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said emerging market investors are now looking again at Asia
in allocating their capital portfolio and Malaysia seems to be one
of their favorite stories.
</P>
<P>
He said the most important point for fixed income investors is
stability and all doubts have now been answered with the election
already out of the way in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Morgan Stanley anticipated two rating agencies, Moody's and
Standard &AMP; Poor's, to upgrade Malaysia's sovereign debt rating
within this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mian, together with Oliver Jory, executive director for debt
capital markets of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Asia, is here on a
fact-finding mission, leading a delegation of 15-fixed income
investors from the United States, Britain and the Asia Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
Mian said both rating agencies would take time to make their
decision but an upgrade on Malaysia's debt ceiling following its
better liquidity and solvency ratio is pretty certain.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's debt currently stands at 43 billion U.S. dollars,
its reserves in excess of 31 billion dollars and its exports in
the range of 87 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Jory meanwhile said at the press conference that there is
tremendous demand for Malaysia's fixed assets as Malaysian
sovereign and corporate bonds performed well in the international
market last year.
</P>
<P>
He said that therefore there are lots of opportunities for
Malaysia and the corporate sector to tap the international bond
market this year, especially euro bonds.
</P>
<P>
The need for Malaysia to tap the international capital market
is not driven by requirement but opportunities to allow
international investors to focus on the development in Malaysia
and put the nation under the spotlight, Jory said.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Explosion Kills 10 in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 27 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 people were killed
and 39 others wounded on Thursday when a powerful bomb exploded in
a letter box in the northern Sri Lankan town of Vavuniya, the
Defense Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
"A bomb which had been inside the outgoing foreign letter box
exploded at the Vavuniya post office today around 11:20 a.m. (0520
GMT)," said a ministry statement.
</P>
<P>
The explosion killed 10 persons and wounded 12 soldiers, seven
police personnel and 20 civilians, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the soldiers were at the post office to send
money to their families in the south of Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Rescue operations have been conducted to rush the wounded to
the nearby hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The bombing came despite tight security throughout the country
amid fears of more bomb attacks by the separatist Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels who are fighting for an
independent homeland for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and
east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The bomb attacks have been the trademark of the LTTE rebels who
are blamed for a series of suicide bomb attacks in recent weeks
against President Chandrika Kumaratunga and other senior officials.
</P>
<P>
The ministry statement said government troops killed nine LTTE
rebels in four separate clashes in the northernmost Jaffna
peninsula, the stronghold of the rebels until 1996.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Leader Urges to Improve School Teachers' Welfare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Thursday issued a series of directives aimed at improving
the plight of the country's public school teachers, the
presidential palace said.
</P>
<P>
A presidential statement said Estrada also lauded a senate
initiative to undertake a comprehensive research project aimed at
promoting the public school teachers' welfare.
</P>
<P>
"The senate project, a first attempt at learning from teachers
themselves about the circumstances behind their employment,
benefits and working conditions, will greatly aid the government
in adequately funding its education programs and addressing the
concerns and problems of the country's public school tutors,"
Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
The project, which is called the Teacher Assistance for Optimum
Well-Being, is spearheaded by the Senate Committee on Education,
Arts and Culture chaired by Senator Tessie Oreta.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the findings of the project, Estrada immediately
ordered the Presidential Management Staff and the Housing and
Urban Development Coordinating Council to prepare a proposal for a
teachers' housing program.
</P>
<P>
The president also directed the Technical Education and Skills
Development Authority to provide non-formal training programs for
the unemployed spouses of school teachers "so that we can harness
them for productive purposes."
</P>
<P>
A government report said that about 26 percent of the total
number of teacher-respondents in the research have unemployed
spouses. The report also showed that female teachers with
unemployed husbands outnumber male teachers with unemployed wives.
</P>
<P>
The president also directed Education Department to come up
with a clear proposal on how to compensate teachers assigned to
difficult posts in remote areas.

MANILA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Some 160 hectares of ricelands
in central part of the Philippines have been infested by rat,
Philippine News Agency said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Abednego Gerona, a local agriculture official,

nine villages in Siaton of Negros Oriental province in Visayas.
</P>
<P>
Gerona said the rat infestation has affected some 663 farmers

</P>
<P>
He said the situation is not so "larming" considering that only
35-36 percent has been reportedly affected of the total rice
farmlands of Siaton.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, farmers of these villages, in which farming
is the only means of livelihood, have greatly affected their rice
production.
</P>
<P>
Gerona hopes the financial counterpart from local government
will help assist the farmers in their purchase of "rodenticides",
a product which poisons rat.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government's Shame Campaign Declared  Unconstitutional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Court of Appeals
Thursday declared unconstitutional the "Spray-Paint Shame Campaign
" initiated by the Department of Interior and Local Governments,
Philippine News Agency (PNA) said.
</P>
<P>
The appellate court also issued a writ of prohibition to
further prevent implementation of the said campaign, which the
Secretary Alfredo Lim has undertaken as part of the government's
intensified drive against illegal drugs, the PNA said.
</P>
<P>
Lim, appointed to be the secretary of the department by
President Joseph Estrada early January, began the shame campaign
last week in Manila by spray painting signs on two houses, an
effort said to kick off the anti-drug drive nationwide.
</P>
<P>
In a 25 page decision, the court said "scarlet letter' drive is
violative of one of the fundamental guarantees established in the
Constitution that all accused shall be presumed innocent until the
contrary is proved.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the appellate court said the appropriate and legal
course of action is to charge, arrest and prosecute suspected drug
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
The Manila ordinance allowing the spray painting drive "
violates the constitutional guarantee of due process that hears
before it condemns and renders judgment only after trial," the
court decision said.
</P>
<P>
The appellate tribunal further stressed that the constitutional
guarantee of equal protection of the laws is evidently abridged
under the Manila ordinance.

expected to reach, the minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The dispute, which first flared up last November but appeared
to have been resolved last month, was triggered off by Kenya's
unwillingness to reduce tariffs on certain Egyptian exports as
required by the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA) pact.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, Egypt impounded more than 20 million U.S.
dollars of Kenyan tea at an Egyptian port.
</P>
<P>
Buying over 150 million dollars of Kenyan tea in 1999, Egypt is
the third biggest Kenyan tea buyer only after Britain and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Early this week, Egyptian tea buyers boycotted Kenya's weekly
tea auction in Kenya's Indian Ocean port city of Mombasa and sent
the tea prices in the market plunging.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Hopeful of IMF Aid Resumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Kenya does not anticipate more
conditionalities by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the
World Bank in the newly designed poverty reduction and growth
facility, Kenyan Finance Minister Chris Okemo has said.
</P>
<P>
Okemo made the remarks Wednesday during the signing of exchange
notes with Japanese ambassador to Kenya for the
802-million-shilling (around 11 million U.S. dollars) grant to the
country for immunization programs and the purchase of farm inputs.
</P>
<P>
The minister said most of the conditions set by the IMF after
it suspended the 205-million-dollar loan in 1997 had been met,
with some still being worked on.
</P>
<P>
Okemo noted that these conditionalities should not be seen as
some form of punishment coming from the donor community, but
should be viewed as conditions good for the development of the
country.
</P>
<P>
A visiting IMF team, which arrived here Monday, is now holding
discussions with the government officials, stakeholders and
relevant sectors on the possibilities of the resumption of aid to
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The minister said discussions with the IMF team were very
cordial, but it was not easy to fully comment on what has
transpired.
</P>
<P>
The IMF suspended the loan to Kenya three years ago for the
alleged poor governance and corruption among other issues in the
east African country. The suspension has brought Kenya's economy
into serious drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
But earlier this month when media reports said that the IMF and
the Kenyan government would resume aid talks soon, the local
currency appreciated quite a lot, from some 74 shillings to one
U.S. dollar late last year to 67 shillings to one dollar.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Copper Mine Deal Stalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Anglo American Corporation has
deferred scheduled signing of the final take-over agreement of
Zambia's copper mines, citing administrative and legal hitches as
the reason, a Zambian newspaper said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Anglo American acting managing director for central Africa,
Ronnie Peiris, confirmed this Wednesday. But he declined to
disclose the details, saying that the deal will be sealed at a
later date to be announced.
</P>
<P>
It is likely that the closing of the deal will not be achieved
by January 31 this year because of the complex nature of some
legal binding documents, Peiris was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"There are large volumes of the administrative and legal issues
that need to be worked through," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Zambian Mines Minister Syamukayumbu Syamujaye said the
deadline could be rescheduled to a later date as it is a mere
guideline. But that does not mean the transaction has failed, the
minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed last month, the assets of three mines
of the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines -- Nchanga Division,
Konkola Division and Nampundwe Mine -- will be sold to Anglo
American.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government has been making efforts in recent years
to privatize the southern African country's copper mines in order
to attract foreign investment and advanced technology and
management as soon as possible to revive the ailing mining
industry.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Require Political Parties to Hold Elections Regularly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government will
introduce a new law requiring political parties to hold elections
regularly to inculcate the culture of democracy in the country,
the Zambia Daily Mail newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Home Affairs Minister Peter Machungwa told parliament
Wednesday that his ministry will ensure that political parties
regularize elections and live by their constitutional provisions.
</P>
<P>
There are currently about forty political parties in the
southern African country, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Most political parties still have interim committees from the
time they were registered and are unwilling to undergo elections,
the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
The new law will compel these political parties to specify
within their provisional requirements to elect, he added.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Kills 4,300 Kenyan Women Per Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Some 4,300 Kenyan women of
reproductive age die of pregnancy-related complications every
year, the Nurses Association of Kenya has said.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey in six districts of the east African country
showed that 35 percent of the gynecological ward admissions were
due to incomplete abortions, said Heme Ndung'u, secretary of the
nurses association.
</P>
<P>
However, the data underestimated the extent of the problem
since they presented only those women admitted to hospitals for
treatment, the Kenya Times newspaper Thursday quoted the nurse
boss as saying.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Kenya's senior health officials proposed to legalize
abortion but met with stiff resistance from religious community
and some conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Due to the illegal status of abortion, many Kenyan women turn
to quacks or witch doctors, which have caused many unnecessary
tragedies.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, Ghana to Launch Free Trade Area by April 30 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and Ghana have fixed
April 30 this year as the date for the establishment of a free
trade area between them and several neighbors under the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
A Ghana-Nigeria strategic cooperation meeting has agreed to
implement concrete physical infrastructural projects and programs
to further enhance the integration process, the Guardian newspaper
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The customs, national standards organizations and food and
drugs agencies were also urged to work out appropriate modalities
to facilitate the establishment of a free trade area by April 30
this year.
</P>

borderless zone.
</P>
<P>
The final communique of the Ghana-Nigeria strategic cooperation
meeting said that the four neighboring countries are to embark on
complete eradication of rigid border formalities, the application
of prescribed ECOWAS customs and immigration procedures as well as
the implementation of joint border patrols.

<HEADLINE> Southern African Economic Performance to Improve: ECA Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The economic performance in
southern Africa is expected to improve this year, a senior
official of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa
(ECA) has predicted.
</P>
<P>
The turn-around in the prices of minerals, particularly copper,
gold and diamonds, is expected to sustain the economies of
southern African countries in the high gear and ensure greater
vibrancy during the year 2000, said Robert Okello, Director of the
ECA Sub-Regional Development Center for Southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Given the improved weather conditions registered late 1999, the
outlook of agricultural production in most countries of the
sub-region is bright, the Zambia Daily Mail newspaper reported
Thursday quoted Okello as saying.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, all member countries of the sub-region are targeting
sound macro-economic environment as a fundamental requirement that
would underpin future investment and growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, most southern African countries are committed to
continuing the implementation of economic reform programs and
deepening market-based policies in the year 2000, the ECA official
noted.
</P>
<P>
According to Okello, regional cooperation and economic
integration will continue to be consolidated in the sub-region,
which will create a large, economically viable and unified market.

KAMPALA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese government has
handed over to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) 54
Ugandan children abducted by rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army
(LRA) fighting Kampala authorities.
</P>
<P>
These children are aged between six and 18 years, a UNICEF
official was quoted as saying by Thursday's New Vision newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The abducted children were released under a peace accord signed

last year.
</P>
<P>
Uganda released the last batch of Sudanese prisoners of war
earlier this month.
</P>

The LRA rebels have been fighting against the Ugandan
government since 1986 and the UNICEF estimates that more than
10,000 Ugandans have been kidnapped in the past five years.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's House of
Representatives Committee on the Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC)
violence has begun a fact- finding mission in Lagos, the Guardian
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The OPC is a radical ethnic group of the Yorubas, one of the
Nigeria's three largest nationalities.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the 14-member House committee, Malam Zailaini, said
here Wednesday that his team would contact people with diverse
opinions on the OPC issue.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Governor Bola Tinubu, the committee described
the activities of various militant groups in the most populous
African country as capable of tearing the nation apart.
</P>
<P>
Tinubu said that no governor would fold his arms and allow his
state to be taken over by hoodlums.
</P>
<P>
The committee should get to the root of the crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, some House representatives asked the federal
government to ban the radical ethnic groups including the OPC and
Arewa Peoples Congress (APC), which were believed to be behind the
recent ethinic conflicts in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
The conflicts between Yorubas, Hausas and Ijaws, other two
major ethnic groups in the west African country, had killed
hundreds of people in recent months.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Angolan refugees at Mayukwayukwa
camp in Zambia's Western Province are selling guns to earn a
living, a Zambia daily Mail newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Villagers in the area buying the guns from the refugees and
reselling them to people who are traveling there, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Some refugees revealed that they hide arsenal on their way to
the camps in Zambia and retrieve the arms later after settling
down in camps.
</P>
<P>
The villagers around the refugee settlement alleged that some
refugees were crossing into the country with guns which they were
later selling to them for killing people.
</P>
<P>
They appealed to the Zambian government to help in tracking
down the criminals in the refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Home Affairs Peter Machungwa said refugees breaking
the law would be treated like any other offender.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees
(UNHCR) said that it would strive to ease and improve the
deplorable conditions refugees were living in.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Grandmothers Meet Grandson in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The six-year-old Cuban boy,
Elian Gonzalez, was reunited with his grandmothers at Miami Beach
on Wednesday, the United States, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The reunion lasted about two hours at the home of Sister Jeanne
O'Laughlin, president of Barry University, who has a long history
of helping immigrants, according to the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Mariela Quintana and Raquel Rodriguez, who flew from Cuba last
week with a hope to take Elian back, finally met their grandson,
who was rescued from a shipwreck after his mother and stepfather
drowned when their boat capsized in an effort to come to the
United States illegally.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that the grandmothers were received with
tossing flowers when the car came to the nun's house and about 200
demonstrators were waiting outside the house. Some cheered and
others booed as the grandmothers passed.
</P>
<P>
After failing to meet the boy when they flew to Miami on Monday,
the grandmothers asked to meet the boy in a neutral site where
there are no anti-Cuba protesters who demand the boy stay in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Relatives of Elian in Florida insist that the boy should stay
with them while the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (
INS) ruled early this month that the boy belongs to his father in
Cuba and should be returned.
</P>
<P>
Several congressmen and anti-Cuban organizations in the U.S.,
trying to use the boy to attack the Cuban government, appealed for
a citizenship for the boy although it was rejected by his father.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said on Wednesday that
he has no solid plans for handling legislation next week to give
Elian U.S. citizenship.
</P>
<P>
"Legislation was introduced with regard to the Elian Gonzalez
matter. It is not going to be acted on this week, obviously. It
could come up next week. But there are a lot of people looking at
this issue, and there may be developments between now and then,"
Lott said.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton had appealed that politics should be
avoided in handling the Elian case and expressed his support for
the INS decision to return the boy to Cuba.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Presidential Contenders Hold Debates Before Primary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Republican and Democratic
presidential contenders held their last campaign debates
respectively in New Hampshire Wednesday before the first primary
in the state.
</P>
<P>
In the 90-minute debate, the five Republican contenders covered
topics from education, the price of home heating oil, to campaign
finance.
</P>
<P>
Both Texas Governor George W. Bush and Senator John McCain were
very careful on the issue of abortion, a sensitive topic for the
conservative party.
</P>
<P>
Bush said the Republican Party "must be big enough to welcome"
dissenting views, and the Arizona senator declined to repeat
earlier comments suggesting he might permit his own child to end a
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
Bush, whose campaign is based on a theme of "compassionate
conservatism," is hoping to avoid offending moderate voters who do
not agree with the Republican's strong anti-abortion platform.
</P>
<P>
The Texas governor is the national front-runner in the
presidential campaign, but McCain leads in most of the pre-primary
polls in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
The Republican field became smaller after Senator Orrin Hatch
from Utah dropped out of the race earlier Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Millionaire publisher Steve Forbes, former ambassador to the U.
N. Alan Keyes and former Reagan aide Gary Bauer also attended the
debate.
</P>
<P>
Later in the evening, Democrats Al Gore and Bill Bradley took
their turn for the debate at the same location -- a television
studio in New Hampshire's largest city with no live audience.
</P>
<P>
Former New Jersey Senator Bradley attacked Vice President Gore
in unusually personal terms in the debate.
</P>
<P>
"When Al accuses me of negative campaigning, that reminds me of
the story about Richard Nixon, the kind of politician who would
chop down a tree, then stand on the stump and give a speech about
conservation," said Bradley, Gore's only contender for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to talk about a higher standard you're going
to need to live by them," Gore rebutted.
</P>
<P>
The two men also clashed sharply about negative campaign
advertising.
</P>
<P>
The 60-minute debate marked an abrupt change in campaign
tactics by Bradley, observers said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first debate since Gore's runaway victory in Iowa
caucuses and also the final time before New Hampshire holds the
first primary next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Recent polls show that support rates are almost the same for
the two rivals, but victory is more important politically for
Bradley, given his poor showing in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
Both Gore and Bradley are battling for independents who could
prove decisive in the primary.

<HEADLINE> Japan Disagrees With Rightist's Denial of Nanjing Massacre: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government disagrees
with views expressed at a gathering held last Sunday by a Japanese
group denying the 1937 Nanjing Massacre, Chief Cabinet Secretary
Mikio Aoki said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"There is no denying that there were killings of civilians and
looting after the fall of Nanjing in 1937," the top Japanese
government spokesman told a press conference, adding, "The
government's position on this matter has not changed at all."
</P>
<P>
Aoki's remarks came one day after Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan summoned Japanese Ambassador to China Sakutaro Tanino to
the Chinese Foreign Ministry and lodged a strong protest against
the recent anti-China moves by Japan's right-wing forces.
</P>
<P>
Tang told the Japanese ambassador that the Chinese government
and all the Chinese people are indignant over the anti-China
actions taken by the Japanese rightist force to distort history by
denying the 1937 Nanjing Massacre and an unjust verdict by the
Japanese Supreme Court against an ex-Japanese soldier.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese right-wing group on January 23 held a gathering in
Osaka, western Japan, to openly deny the 1937 Nanjing Massacre, in
which more than 300,000 Chinese civilians and unarmed service men
were killed.
</P>
<P>
Before the anti-China rally, the Japanese Supreme Court again
rejected the case of Azuma Shiro, an ex-soldier of the Japanese
army, who witnessed the massacre and published his diary to expose
the truth of the atrocities.

TOKYO, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed higher in

PARIS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel

CANBERRA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Lindsay Davenport outpowered
Jennifer Capriati in straight sets to reach the final of the
Australian Open in Melbourne on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Despite her strained left thigh, Davenport breezed across
Capriati 6-2, 7-6 (7-4) in the one-hour-22-minute competition, a
conflict of baseline attacks.
</P>
<P>
Taking the first set in 22 minutes, Davenport, the second seed
in the tournament, dropped only five points on serve and twice
breaking Capriati's service.
</P>

However, Capriati showed her old competitiveness when she
fought back from 2-4 in the second set, winning eight straight
points to tie the set at 4-4 and broke for the third time in the
set to force the tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
At 4-4 in the tiebreaker, Capriati yielded with a backhand into
the net, then barely missed a return wide to fall behind 6-4.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian to Initiate Gradual Training Method  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Soccer Association of
Indonesia (PSSI) will introduce a gradual training method to
ensure sustainability in grooming young players for the national
soccer team.
</P>
<P>
PSSI's official in charge of athletes' development Nurdin Halid
said that the new method allowed the national team coach to
cooperate with coaches from local clubs to select young players to
join the seniors on the national team.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, Nurdin said, PSSI had appointed Nandar
Iskandar as head coach for the national team.
</P>
<P>
"We will introduce the gradual training method and one of the
assistant coaches will train the junior team. It will maintain
sustainability of players. This is important because in the near
future, we will be looking for under 23-year-old players for the
Southeast Asian (SEA) Games team next year," Nurdin said.
</P>
<P>
Nurdin said Nandar would decide the national team's playing
formation, recruitment criteria and talent-scouting method.
</P>
<P>
"These factors will be discussed by Nandar and other soccer
coaches across the nation," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post
Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The talent-scouting procedure will be conducted by the newly
appointed manager Danurwindo.
</P>
<P>
Nurdin said he would apply strict measures in the talent-
scouting.
</P>
<P>
"We have asked PSSI chairman to stage under 16-year-old (U-16)
and U-19 tournaments. We will not tolerate any age deception," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Nurdin said he had proposed PSSI Chairman Agum Gumelar to
modify the salary system for national team coach and its players.
</P>
<P>
"I suggest that PSSI hires Nandar for one year terms. We want
the coach to improve his preparation. We hope his future tenure is
governed by this new system. He will receive contract fees and
monthly salary. As for the national players, they will be paid
according to their seniority, their dedication to the national
team and their performance," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nurdin said there would be a selection process to choose
members of the national team for competition in the Asian Cup in
Lebanon From October 12 to 29 and the Tiger Cup in Thailand from
November 5 to 18.
</P>
<P>
"I have set a goal for our team to reach the second round of
the Asian Cup and to be the champion in the Tiger Cup," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- World No.1 Andre Agassi
weathered a Pete Sampras storm to force his way into the
Australian Open men's singles final at the Melbourne Park in
Melbourne Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Agassi came back from two sets to one down to win 6-4, 3-6, 6-7
(0-7), 7-6 (7-5), 6-1 in a match that lived up to almost every
expectation.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 Australian champion and the championships' top seed
appeared destined for an early departure as the ice-cold Sampras
repeatedly blasted his way out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
But with victory within his grasp, Sampras faltered, losing the
fourth set tiebreak and offering unusually weak resistance in the
fifth.
</P>
<P>
In a match which started tentatively, Sampras' play failed to
reach its highest level.
</P>
<P>
For most of the match he was held in check by Agassi, the
difference being his ability to produce a booming serve when it
was needed most.
</P>
<P>
Agassi drew first blood, breaking serve in the fifth game of
the first set and never allowing his opponent a chance to do the
same.
</P>
<P>
For Sampras, the defeat destroyed his 8-0 record in five-
setters at the Australian Open, while for Agassi it narrowed the
gap between the two, their record now standing at 17-12 in favor
of Sampras.

<HEADLINE> Northwest China Province Closes 648 Small Coal Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Gansu Province, a major coal-
consumer in northwest China, closed down 648 small coal mines and
cut coal production by about 4.63 million tons last year.
</P>
<P>
The closings were a part of China's efforts to curb the random
development of small coal mines and save resources, reduce coal
mine accidents, and improve the environment.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to this streamlining, the province's coal production is
now in good order, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
Gansu had 1,300 small coal mines run by township enterprises or
state firms at the beginning of 1999, and blind production by
these mines had led to an oversupply of coal and a price war on
the local market, posing a serious threat to the normal operations
of state-run coal mines.
</P>
<P>
In addition, these mines caused heavy pollution and were the
site of frequent accidents, mainly due to poor equipment.
</P>
<P>
To reduce huge coal stockpiles, the provincial government sent
more than 1,200 inspectors to the small mines to supervise their
reduction and closing.
</P>
<P>
These efforts have paid off, as pollution has been reduced and
productivity improved.

<HEADLINE> New Yuanmou Fossil Evidence Promotes Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, January 27 (Xinhua)-- The fossilized lower-jaw of a
Yuanmou Man, believed to be the origin of man in China, has been
discovered in Yunnan Province in southwest China, and is
considered a breakthrough for China's palaeoanthropological
research.
</P>
<P>
From study of the camber of the intact lower jaw much can be
learned about the evolution process of the ape-man genus,
according to Qi Guoqin, a specialist in the study of ancient
vertebrates and palaeoanthropology at the Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
The first Yuanmou Man, which dates back to around 1.7 million
years ago, was discovered in 1965 at Shangnabang Village in
Yuanmou County, Yunnan Province. The first finds were two fossil
teeth, which were identified as human central upper incisors
belonging to one adult. After that, a lower jaw fossil was
discovered in 1984, regarded as a key piece of evidence on the
evolution of China's pithecanthropus.
</P>
<P>
China set up a national research program including a probe into
whether or not China is the origin of human beings. In addition to
the discovery of the lower jaw of Yuanmou Man, more than 80 ape-
men teeth, and over one thousand fossils of various species of
ancient animals were also unearthed by experts involved in the
program.
</P>
<P>
All these fossils make up an ecological group that, to some
extent, show the ancient climate, ecology, geography and even
relationships between ape-men and animals, said Qi.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan is abundant in various pithecanthropus fossils, and one
Australian paleoanthropologist said he believes many more finds
could be made there if the same amount of manpower and materials
were used as that employed at some sites in Africa.
</P>
<P>
A further excavation project is currently underway.

NANNING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region will make greater efforts to build more high-
tech development zones in the future.
</P>
<P>
In the years to come, high and new technologies, as well as the
industries based on them should play a more important role in
advancing Guangxi's regional economic development, said Li

attract more high-tech businesses by introducing more foreign
investment, and cultivate a good environment to attract qualified
professionals.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi has created three high-tech such zones in Nanning,

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- More than 20 railway
transportation lines totaling some 2,000 kilometers are planned
for a dozen Chinese cities, said officials with the Ministry of
Construction.
</P>
<P>
Railway transportation includes urban express railways, subways,
light rails, and trolley cars.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Wuhan, and Changchun are all
planning to build such a network to conquer the traffic jams and
serious pollution caused by the rapid increase of the urban
population and the number of automobiles in China.
</P>
<P>
The network will have the advantages of cleanliness, security,
punctuality, high speed, and large transport capacity, said the
officials.
</P>
<P>
Financial and technological factors have hampered the
development of such a system over the past three decades, and
there are now only about 90 km of underground lines in the country
with some 600 subway trains in use.
</P>
<P>
Now, however, Beijing alone is planning to build a railway
system composed of 13 main routes and two extensions lines
totaling 408 km, and increase the railway transport proportion to
50 percent from the present 15 percent, according to local
officials.
</P>
<P>
China's first urban railway line was in Beijing and began test
operations in October 1969, and the second, in Tianjin, was open
to traffic in December 1984.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Baogang Group
Company, China's most modern steel producer, netted profits of 1.5
billion yuan (180 million US dollars) in 1999, up some 50 percent
from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show the sales volume of the company rose by
1.9 percent to reach 25.24 billion yuan (3.04 billion US dollars)
last year.
</P>
<P>
Company Chairman Xu Daquan attributed the growth to the
economic recovery in Asia and technological upgrading of the
company.
</P>
<P>
The company group exported 1.56 million tons of iron and steel
last year, the bulk of which were sold to neighboring Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
About 24 percent of its products are now technology-intensive
and are widely used for the manufacture of motor vehicles,
household appliances, containers, and various other industrial
products.
</P>
<P>
Formerly called the Baoshan Iron and Steel Complex, the Baogang
Group adopted its present name after merging with the Shanghai
Metallurgical Company and the Meishan Steel Company.
</P>
<P>
The merger was aimed at helping China, one of the largest iron
and steel producers in the world, become a more powerful
manufacturer.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
JI'NAN, January 27 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province,
which ranks third in the country in gross domestic product, has
made remarkable progress in controlling pollution as part of a
national effort.
</P>
<P>
According to figures from the Shandong Provincial Environmental
Protection Bureau, the emission of sulfur dioxide in the province
was reduced by 22 percent last year and that of suspended
particles cut by five percent.
</P>
<P>
While improving pollution-control facilities in about 1,000
major enterprises last year, the province closed more than 3,000
small plants and mines that were causing serious pollution and
consuming an excessive amount of fuel.
</P>
<P>
Some 88 percent of the urban garbage in the province is now
treated before being discharged.
</P>
<P>
Tough measures have been taken in China's major polluted
regions during the past three years, including the closing of tens
of thousands of small polluting factories and mines across the
country that failed to meet state pollutant-discharge requirements.
</P>
<P>
The country as a whole has closed 6,400 mines which produced 26
million tons of coal with high sulfur content each year, in its
campaign to control sulfur dioxide and acid rain in 175
prefectures and cities.
</P>
<P>
By the end of November 1999, the total volume of 12 pollutants
discharged into the air, water, and land across China, with the
exception of solid industrial wastes, was well below the ceiling
levels for 1999 set by the central government.

<HEADLINE> Earthquake Hits Yunnan, But No Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake with a 5.5
magnitude struck south China's Yunnan province early this morning
in the border area of Mile and Qiubei counties, resulting in no
deaths and only two injuries.
</P>
<P>
The local seismological bureau reported that some houses and
roads in the remote area had sustained damage, but no further
details were available because communication access to the region
is limited.
</P>
<P>
The 4.55 a.m. (2055 GMT Wednesday) tremor is unlikely to result
in large economic losses as few people live in the area, said Que
Yunchang, a spokesman with the bureau.
</P>
<P>
The China Seismological Bureau said that the epicenter of the
quake was located at 24.2 degrees north latitude and 103.6 degrees
east longitude. The quake caused losses to 2,060 households there.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the local electricity bureau said that there
have been no signs of power outages.
</P>
<P>
Six rescue groups have been sent to the quake-hit area, headed
by Chen Xunru, deputy provincial governor.
</P>
<P>
The lowest temperature in the area today is predicted to be 1
to 2 degrees Celsius, and the meteorological station forecasts a
possible moderate to heavy snowfall in the next two days, when
temperatures are to drop to minus-2 degrees Celsius.
</P>
<P>
The two counties, located in southwest part of the province,
are situated in a mountainous area mostly inhabited by Miao,
Zhuang, Hani and Yi ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Two quakes with magnitudes of 5.9 and 6.5 struck Yao'an County
in the province's Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture on Jan. 15,
killing five, injuring 1,544, and leaving more than 90,000
homeless.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing municipal
government will make more efforts to attract foreign investment
for economic development in the Chinese capital this year, with
focus placed on funds from multinational corporations.
</P>
<P>
New measures, including opening Internet web site and inviting
overseas intermediary institutions for business promotion, will be
adopted to lure foreign investors, said Vice-Mayor Zhang Mao at a
work conference on foreign trade and economic cooperation today.
</P>
<P>
While continuing to attract funds from Asian countries and
regions, the city will pay special attention to encouraging
investors from the European Union and North America, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the city will encourage multinational corporations
to set up their regional headquarters in Beijing, open its market
wider to the outside world, and give strong support for
cooperation between local state-owned enterprises and
multinationals.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Rat Poison Kills Birds in Ancient Temple </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The staff at the Temple of
Confucius in Beijing are astonished that the poison they prepared
for rats and pests has killed birds inhabiting the temple.
</P>
<P>
Li Chaoying, chief of the protection administration of the
temple, said, "In the past three years, there have been three or
four dead owls and magpies around here each year, and tests show
they had eaten poisoned dead rats or poison bait."
</P>
<P>
The staff at the temple, where stand more than 100 cypress
trees and ancient architecture, had used pesticide and rat poison
to kill spider mites and rats in the temple in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Located in eastern Beijing, the Temple of Confucius used to be
where emperors in feudal dynasties did obeisance to Confucius (
551 B.C. - 479 B.C.), China's great philosopher and educator. Now
the temple accommodates tens of thousands of visitors from China
and abroad, as well as hundreds of owls, cuckoos and magpies which
build nests on the trees and sometimes stay around all year.
</P>
<P>
Although Beijing is now in winter, with daytime temperature
about three Centigrade below zero, dozens of owls can still be
seen flying about and into the old cypress trees at the temple.
</P>
<P>
Li said that when the staff used poison to kill rats, they have
never thought this would be fatal to the birds, adding that this
lesson will make him reconsider ways to protect the temple.
</P>
<P>
Gao Wu, an ornithologist at Capital Normal University, said
after examining the dead birds that it is not a good idea to kill
rats with chemicals which are also harmful to other creatures
living at the temple.
</P>
<P>
Sun Xin of the Beijing Forestry Bureau suggests that old-
fashioned mechanical traps could be used to catch the rats, and
this would be better for the environment.
</P>
<P>
Li said he will submit a report to the authorities and pledged
to solve the problem as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> China's Stock Market Expands Further in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- China's stock market has
expanded further in 1999, with the turnover on the Shanghai and
Shenzhen bourses hitting 3.13 trillion yuan, up 33 percent from
1998, said Zhou Zhengqing, chairman of the China Securities
Regulatory Commission (CSRC).
</P>
<P>
Zhou said at an ongoing conference here that the number of
China's publicly-listed firms rose to 949 by the end of 1999, and
the market value of their stocks was worth of 2.65 trillion yuan,
up 36 percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
Newly-listed firms raised a total of 124.3 billion yuan from
both home and overseas markets in 1999, which is 30 percent higher
than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, investors opened 44.71 million accounts on
the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The year 1999 saw the most intensive and extensive reforms in
history, resulting in an improved regulatory system, a market-
oriented appraisal system for initial public offering and expanded
capital supply to the market, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
Preferential policies were granted to high-tech enterprises in
1999. Such enterprises now account for 17 percent of the listed
firms in China.
</P>
<P>
Efforts by the watchdog to rectify the market order also paid
off, Zhou said. Illegal trading floors were closed down, and a
number of old investment funds have been restructured.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- China will set up markets for
high-tech securities on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges
this year in support of the development of high-tech enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Zhengqing, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory
Commission (CSRC) made this remark at an ongoing conference in the
Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhou, these high-tech markets will have their own
stock indices.
</P>
<P>
The quota system for initial public offerings (IPO) will be
abandoned and replaced by a system under which the chief
underwriters will take more responsibility, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it remains the government's policy to encourage
enterprises going public to raise funds in order to promote state-
owned enterprise (SOEs) reform and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, although all kinds of enterprises will be
allowed to issue stock as long as they meet the required
conditions, yet, priority will be given to SOEs.
</P>
<P>
This year, the government intends to encourage mergers and
takeovers among listed firms as a way to improve their performance.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he acknowledged that the government is considering
exit mechanisms for listed firms that have been losing money for
three consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
The unsatisfactory performance of some listed firms has become
a major topic of concern among both economists and investors in
China.

<HEADLINE> China's Reinsurance Market Faces Imminent Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- China's reinsurance market is
gearing up for competition as the government moves to approve new
reinsurance firms this year in preparation for its expected entry
into the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Currently, the reinsurance market is monopolized by the China
Reinsurance Company (China Re), which was formed four years ago
and split from the former People's Insurance Company of China (
group) in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
Dai Fengju, China Re's general manager, said his company is not
afraid of competition from either at home or abroad.
</P>
<P>
China Re, as the first-comer, has many advantages, he said,
noting that in its fours years of operation, the company has
accumulated experience, fostered a batch of top-level managers and
technicians, and gathered influence that could be daunting to
potential competitors.
</P>
<P>
The company reported a premium income of 11.8 billion yuan (1.4
billion US dollars) in 1998 and nine billion yuan (10.8 billion US
dollars) in the first nine months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Its assets have increased from the initial three billion yuan (
361 million US dollars) to the present 11.5 billion yuan (1.4
billion US dollars), and its liability reserve from 4.8 billion
yuan (578 million US dollars) to eight billion yuan (964 million
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The entrance of foreign business rivals would bring competition
as well as advanced management and technology, which would compel
China Re to further improve its management and service, Dai added.
</P>
<P>
Not only will competitors from home and abroad seek their share
of the market, Dai said, but all firms will be working hard to
find qualified reinsurance professionals, and China already has an
acute shortage of those.
</P>
<P>
As a state-owned enterprise (SOE), China Re faces the same
problems in corporate governance and management as other SOEs, Dai
said. So the company would strive to transform itself into a
modern enterprise and internationally-competitive reinsurer in
three years.
</P>
<P>
This year, the company will reform its major departments so as
to clarify the rights and responsibilities of each position and
pay each employee according to performance.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Dai said, an experimental reform has taken place in
its Property Insurance Department in 1999, producing a 60 percent
rise in its domestic commercial reinsurance business volume.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after it became an independent operator last year, the
company set its goal of becoming one of the top 10 reinsurers in
the world both in premium income and management in 10 years. Dai
said the goal remains unchanged.

<HEADLINE> China Giving Financial Support to Housing Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- China is trying to
commercialize the housing sector and boost housing sales by
setting up housing-related banks, funds, loans and mortgages.
</P>
<P>
To stimulate home-buying and develop the housing market, it is
essential to set up related banks on a trial basis which are
authorized to provide financial guarantees, loans and mortgages
for home-buyers, said Vice-Minister of Construction Liu Zhifeng.
</P>
<P>
China is in the midst of transforming its subsidized housing
system into a commercial housing market, where people buy their
own homes.
</P>
<P>
At present, China is still suffering from slack housing sales,
with more than 60 million sq.m. of housing standing idle, said Liu,
who attributed the lackluster market to a shortage of funds to
purchase houses and high purchase prices.
</P>
<P>
China's financial departments have cut numerous taxes on real
estate transactions, in an attempt to lower the current prices to
a rational level, he added.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister underlined the importance of strengthening
the public housing fund system to boost consumer purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
China has formed a nationwide public housing fund system, which
covers 225 cities at and above the prefecture level and over 500
cities at county level.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank will
heighten supervision of the banking sector this year to improve
its management and overall quality, said a senior official of the
central bank.
</P>
<P>
Dai Xianglong, Governor of the People's Bank of China (PBOC),
said at the PBOC's annual working meeting, which closed today,
that the safety, efficiency and stability of the banking sector is
critical for the smooth operation of the national economy and for
hitting the targets of national economic development.
</P>
<P>
He said that in recent years China's financial reform has
achieved great results. The central bank's supervisory power has
been reinforced and commercial banks' management level largely
improved.
</P>
<P>
While successfully warding off the adverse effects of the Asian
financial crisis, China has solved some financial problems and
promoted economic development and social stability.
</P>
<P>
He demanded that the banking sector increase its sense of
urgency and sense of responsibility, and earnestly implement all
the financial reforms.
</P>
<P>
He said the central bank should step up self-discipline and
constantly improve its level of financial supervision. The central
bank should reinforce financial supervision according to law, and
promote the internal control of commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
The central bank will also fully use its lever to reinforce its
supervision of corporate production and management activities, so
as to raise the efficiency of credit capital and push forward
economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
More will be done to rectify social credit and financial order,
and strictly enforce settlements. Illegal financial activities
will be dealt with severely.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that to meet the challenges of China's accession into
the World Trade Organization and improve banking management
efficiency and international competitiveness, China will continue
to deepen its financial reforms and speed up the establishment of
a modern banking system.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China-EU Trade Sees Stable Growth (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Bilateral trade between China
and the European Union grew 14 percent in 1999 as the two sides
maintained a smooth relationship in trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures released by the General Administration of
Customs show that the two-way trade volume reached 55.7 billion US
dollars last year. China's exports to the EU hit 30.2 billion US
dollars, up 7.3 percent from a year ago, while the country's
imports from the EU topped 25.5 billion US dollars, an increase of
23.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the EU continues to be China's third-largest
trading partner after Japan and the United States. China is the
fourth-largest trading partner of the EU after the U.S.,
Switzerland, and Japan.
</P>
<P>
China's main exports to the EU are garments, spun yarn and
knitwear, footwear, suitcases, toys, radios and acoustic equipment,
pharmaceuticals, plastics, coke, and hand and machine tools.
</P>
<P>
China's leading imports from the EU are machinery and electric
products, wheat, primary plastics, cooking oil, paper and paper
board, pharmaceuticals, chemical fertilizer, and copper alloy and
rolled steel.
</P>
<P>
The stable growth of bilateral trade was made possible by the
joint aspirations and efforts of both sides. Chinese President
Jiang Zemin and Li Peng, top Chinese legislator or chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, visited some
EU member-states last year, whereas the queen of the Netherlands,
the German chancellor, and the prime minister of Greece all came
to visit China.
</P>
<P>
"This high-level exchange helped increase the understanding of
the two sides, and led to still better cooperation in trade and
other economic sectors," said an official with the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), who preferred to
remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also attended the second Asia-Europe conference
and conducted dialogues on a number of trade-related issues last
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
European Union investment in China has grown steadily since the
early 1990s. By October 1999, the number of EU-invested projects
reached 10,025, involving a total contractual investment of 39.61
billion US dollars, and materialized investment was 20.74 billion
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Between January and October last year, the EU invested in 695
projects in China, but the contractual investment dropped 35.2
percent to 3.256 billion US dollars, and the arrived investment
slipped 4.4 percent to 3.33 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
But experts noted that most of the EU-invested projects involve
huge investments and are of high technical standards, which is
just what China has desired.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the EU is a major source of China's technology
imports. In the first nine months of 1999, the country imported a
total of 280 items of technology from EU member-states, with a
contractual volume of 2.457 billion US dollars and accounting for
65.8 percent of all technology imports in the period.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, there are still certain disputes in China-EU
trade and economic cooperation, according to some experts. The EU'
s frequent launching of anti-dumping investigations against China,
its restriction on imports of some Chinese products, and its
banning of some Chinese agricultural produce, have been negative
factors in bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
"China and the EU have highly complementary economies, and
there is great potential for further growth in economic
cooperation and trade," said the MOFTEC official. "Two-way trade
and economic cooperation will continue to grow as long as two
sides make a serious effort to settle their disputes," he added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice President Meets Ghanaian FM (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- A proposed China-Africa
ministerial-level conference to be held in Beijing this fall has
received warm response from African friends, Chinese Vice
President Hu Jintao told visiting Ghanaian Foreign Minister James
Victor Gbeho here today.
</P>
<P>
Gbeho had high praise for China's offer to host the "China-
Africa Cooperation Forum -- Ministerial-Level Conference in
Beijing 2000" in October, describing it as "an important measure
taken by China to strengthen its partnership with African
countries under the new circumstances."
</P>
<P>
Gbeho told Hu that Ghana and other African countries will
actively participate in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Hu said the consolidation and development of ties with all
developing countries, including those in Africa, constituted one
of the key footholds of China's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 when Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited Africa, he
proposed that a long-term relationship of all-round friendly
cooperation between China and African countries be built, thus
defining the direction of the future development of China-Africa
ties in the long run, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
"With the concerted efforts, we believe Sino-African relations
of friendly cooperation will definitely see new and greater
development in the new century," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
The vice president recalled his Africa tour last year and his
meetings with Ghanaian leaders. He lauded China's ties with Ghana,
one of the first African countries to forge diplomatic relations
with China.
</P>
<P>
During the past decades, Hu said, the two countries supported
each other in safeguarding state sovereignty and building their
own country. Also, the two countries carried out fruitful
cooperation in political, economic, cultural, educational and
other fields.

Bilateral ties saw further growth in recent years with frequent
high-level visits, expanding economic cooperation and diversified
cooperative ways and means, he noted.
</P>
<P>
With this 40-year history of diplomatic ties, China is willing
to work with Ghana to bring bilateral ties to a new level in the
21st century, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Gbeho spoke highly of China's achievements in all fields during
the past 20-odd years. With similar historical experience and
common missions to develop national economy and improve people's
life, Gbeho said that his country could draw on China's
development experience.
</P>
<P>
Regarding bilateral ties, he said that the Ghana-China
friendship has stood the test of time and their relationship has
been strengthened.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his gratitude for the support of the Chinese
government and people during the past years, and hoped both sides
could further the unity and cooperation as they face the common
challenges in the new century.
</P>

and Macao. He reiterated that Ghana will adhere to its "one China"
position and supported China's reunification efforts.

East Timor, a Portuguese colony until 1975, was occupied by
Indonesia in 1976 after Portugal's withdrawal. According to an
East Timor direct ballot announced by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan last September, 78 percent of the East Timorese people are
in favor of independence from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"First of all, we express our gratitude for the help and
support that we have received from a number of Asian countries,"
he said, adding he will also tell the hosts that the East Timorese
people are facing "a very difficult situation."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council authorized the establishment of a
United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor last
October. The transitional period will last two or three years.
</P>

Underlining the importance of his Asian tour, he said that if
East Timor is going to be independent, " I will make everybody
believe that the East Timorese people love peace; we want to
contribute to the stability of the region."
</P>
<P>
"We will be a member of the region, we know our obligations,"

pledge to meet international obligations in ozone layer protection.
</P>
<P>
The list, included in a circular jointly signed by China's top
environmental protection, foreign trade and customs departments
earlier last week, specifies that imports of carbon tetrachlorine,
an ozone depleting substance, will be banned while unlicensed
exports and imports of seven other ODS will be illegal as of April
1.
</P>
<P>
The seven ODS are CFC (chlorofluorocarbon)-11, CFC-12, CFC-113,
CFC-114, CFC-13, Halon-1211, and Halon-1301.
</P>
<P>
All ODS traders are required to report to the National ODS
Export and Import Administration Office by January 31 regarding
their contracts involving ODS trade, and must implement these
contracts by March 31.
</P>
<P>
A licensing system to regulate the ODS trade has been set up
by China's State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA),
the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC)
and the General Administration of Customs (GAC).
</P>
<P>
SEPA and MOFTEC are held responsible for registering companies
engaging in ODS trade, and for annual export and import quotas for
all of China as well as individual companies. The MOFTEC is in
charge of issuing ODS trade licenses, while GAC gives clearance to
ODS with licenses issued by METEC.
</P>
<P>
The international community decided in the Montreal Protocol in
1987 to eliminate most harmful ozone-depleting materials by 2010
in a bid to protect the ozone layer, which shields the earth from
the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays.

<HEADLINE> China to Implement Distance-Learning Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Education (MOE)
has pledged in its work agenda for 2000 to start a distance-
learning project and form an open education network.
</P>
<P>
Vice-minister of Education Wei Yu said that China will form a
multifunctional distance-learning network by the year 2010, in a
move to establish a educational system in the country that serves
people of all ages.
</P>
<P>
Distance learning -- taking college courses via the computer --
is a strategic choice to improve China's overall education level,
Wei said.
</P>
<P>
The working outline said that the MOE will cooperate with
educational television departments to establish a distance-
learning program, and to help cultivate China's education software
industry.
</P>
<P>
Wei said that the MOE plans to increase the speed of the
Chinese Education and Research Network (CERNET) this year to 155
megabytes per-second.
</P>
<P>
CERNET, based at Qinghua University, has set branches at
universities in eight cities including Beijing, Shanghai, and
Nanjing. Qinghua University launched a distance-education program
in November, 1994, the first of the kind in China.
</P>
<P>
The multi-media education college of Hunan University in China'
s central Hunan Province began on-line enrollment in March 1998,
becoming China's first on-line school to offer a college degree.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Education (MOE)
will continue to accelerate China's higher education system reform
and push for changes in the college entrance examination system
this year, a ministry official said today.
</P>
<P>
In its working outline for 2000, the MOE said that it will
increase the college enrollment quota to three million this year,
a rise of 300,000 over last year.
</P>
<P>
The MOE will also spur the overhaul of the college enrollment
method, hoping to raise the number of provinces, colleges, and
examinees opting for on-line enrollment to more than half of the
country's total.
</P>
<P>
The MOE will help more universities to open their service
departments to the market and become independent units.
</P>
<P>
China will also spend more on its elite universities, in a bid
to make them bases for cultivating talent. Basic research and high-
tech industrialization are still the emphasis of MOE, which plans
to start 15 university-based scientific technology parks in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The outline points out that China's higher education management
reform will enter a crucial phase in 2000. According to the State
Council, MOE will complete the reform of 200 universities
operating under China's ministries.

<HEADLINE> India not to Put Nepal Under Security Umbrella: Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Indian Ambassador K.V. Rajan
said India will not interfere with Nepal's security arrangements
or deploy any security forces in Nepal's international airport,
the Rising Nepal reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At a reception to mark the 50th anniversary of India's Republic
Day on Wednesday, K.V. Rajan dismissed speculations that there was
some kind of interest on India's part to involve itself in Nepal's
security arrangements in the aftermath of hijacking.
</P>
<P>
"It is nonsense to suggest that India wants to bring Nepal
under its security umbrella or to take over the security at the
Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA)," Rajan said.
</P>
<P>
"India is confident that Nepal would take such steps as are
necessary to ensure that the hospitality of its soil is not abused
by forces which are hostile to India-Nepal relations and indeed to
Nepal itself," he said.
</P>
<P>
After the Indian Airlines passenger jet was hijacked on
December 24, 1999 on route from Kathmandu to New Delhi, there were
reports that India was considering to send security forces to TIA
to help with security checks.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai attended the reception
hosted by the Indian ambassador.

<HEADLINE> World's First Salt Well Still Working </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, January 27 (Xinhua) -- A 160-year-old salt well with a
depth of more than 1,000 meters, believed to be the oldest of its
kind in the world, is still turning out edible salt every day.
</P>
<P>
At present, local workers continue to produce salt with methods
passed down for generations, but production has been only on a
small scale as a demonstration for visitors since the well was
listed as a cultural-relic site.
</P>
<P>
The salt well, called Shenhai, was dug in 1835 in the city of
Zigong in southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
"Salt production here involves several processes, which
incorporate the wisdom of salt workers of the past," said one
worker.
</P>
<P>
"For instance, we add some soybean to skim off impurities so
the salt won't be gritty," he added.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that although the salt from the Shenhai well has a
low iodine content, it does contain rich trace elements, and
pickled vegetable made with this salt has a distinctive flavor.
</P>
<P>
The city of Zigong has been turning out salt for 1,900 years,
and it led the world in salt-well mining and salt production for
more than a century, until the end of the Qing Dynasty in 1911.

<HEADLINE> China Reduces Winter Crops Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- China reduced the planting area
of winter grain crops by 1.65 million ha last year, according to
official figures.
</P>
<P>
The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released a report here
today saying that the planting area of winter grain crops totaled
27.77 million ha in 1999, a decrease of 5.6 percent from the same
period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Winter wheat saw the largest decrease of planting area over the
past two years, dropping 1.7 million ha, or 6.7 percent over the
previous year, to 23.87 million ha.
</P>
<P>
This decrease was partly due to the continuous drop of grain
prices, as the government stopped paying protective prices for low-
quality crops such as winter wheat.
</P>
<P>
According to the NBS report, grain growers in all 26 wheat-
growing provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions have
reduced the planting area of winter wheat.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the planting area of oil seeds surged by 8.7
percent due to rising market prices, and the total planting area
last winter reached 6.89 million ha, increasing 549,000 ha over
the previous winter season.
</P>
<P>
The planting area of vegetables also grew by 594,000 ha, or 11
percent, to 5.98 million ha last winter, while the planting areas
of other grain crops increased from 0.7 percent to 4.03 million ha.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Vice President Gloria
Macapagal-Arroyo urged the people to respect the mandate of
President Joseph Estrada to lead the country until the year 2004,
the national leading newspaper Manila Bulletin said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that the vice president rejected calls for snap
election made by some sectors.
</P>
<P>
"We should all respect that mandate," she was quoted as saying
at her weekly press conference at the Philippine International
Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
Macapagal-Arroyo joined President Estrada Wednesday morning in
the 20th National Prayer Breakfast at the Manila Hotel in praying
for national unity.
</P>
<P>
She expressed confidence that Estrada, whose popularity rating
has plunged to alarming levels, will regain his popularity through
his various initiatives aimed at alleviating the plight of the
Filipino masses.
</P>
<P>
In the latest Pulse Asia survey, Macapagal-Arroyo garnered a
net approval rating of 78 percent with the Luzon region giving her
an 80 percent rating, Visayas -- 70 percent and Mindanao -- 86
percent.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent survey conducted by the Social Weather
Station, however, Estrada's net approval rating declined
drastically from 28 percent in October 1999 to the all-time low
record of positive five percent in December of the same year.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Mission controllers at a
NASA lab started a new attempt on Wednesday to contact the Mars
Polar Lander after they distinguished a weak radio signal which
might have been sent by the spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
After a review of data collected by a radio antenna at Stanford
University, mission controllers at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena said the antenna had possibly heard
something from the Lander during the tests on December 18 or
January 4.
</P>
<P>
The new attempt to contact the Mars Lander was announced by
NASA on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, mission controllers were not optimistic about the new
effort. "This week's test is a real long-shot," said Richard Cook,
the spacecraft's project manager.
</P>
<P>
The Lander was last heard from on December 3 when it was
entering the Martian atmosphere for a 90-day mission to study the
planet's climate and search for frozen water reserve.
</P>
<P>
NASA officially abandoned its efforts to locate the craft on
January 17.

WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The women's World Cup speed
races scheduled for next month were canceled Wednesday for lack of
snow at Snowbasin, the Olympics are to be held in 2002.
</P>
<P>
"All the way over the first half of the course, things were
looking quite good," said Alan Ashley, the U.S. Ski and Snowboard
Team's vice president for athletics. "Then there were places we
found it was thin and not really adequate for downhill racing."
</P>
<P>
Also canceled was an Alpine combined World Cup event that
included races at Snowbasin and at Deer Valley resort near Park
City. The latter resort reported sufficient snow for its race,
which had been scheduled February 6, but International Skiing
Federation's rules require that both events of a combined be
canceled if one cannot be held.
</P>
<P>
It's the second time this World Cup season that Utah races were
canceled. Men's and women's slalom and giant slalom races in Park
City went to Colorado in November because of a lack of snow.
</P>
<P>
Snowbasin is the site for men's and women's downhill and super-

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Already out for the season,
Cleveland Cavaliers center Zydrunas Ilgauskas underwent surgery on
his broken left foot today, beginning the long road back to
possibly playing next season.
</P>
<P>
Ilgauskas, 24, has not played since being diagnosed with the
break on February 17, 1999. The injury forced him to miss the
final 45 game of last season and had not fully healed despite
extended rest and rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
Ilgauskas participated in training camp in October but had
recurring pain and was placed on the injured list. Following eight
weeks of rest, he returned to limited practice on January 1.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time in his career he has been lost for the
season. A 1996 first-round pick of the Cabaliers, he missed the
1996-97 campaign due to a similar injury in his right foot.
</P>
<P>
The loss of Ilgauskas is a severe blow to the Cavaliers, who
are on the outside looking in at the playoff race with a 17-25
mark.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chongqing to Build War Memorial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Chongqing municipal
government has approved the creation of a memorial to commemorate
the bombing of the city by Japanese invaders during the War of
Resistance Against Japan (1937-1945).
</P>
<P>
The project is intended to remind people of the atrocities
committed by the Japanese aggressors, console the souls of Chinese
warriors who died during the war, and educate younger generations,
according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
The project was initiated by the Chongqing Municipal Committee
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
and later won support from the municipal government.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the city established a research center on the
bombing of Chongqing and collected more than 500 relics and
documents related to the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Between January 1938 and August 1943, Japan made 6,800 air-
strikes against this southwestern city, killing or injuring more
than 20,000 people and leaving over 60,000 buildings in ruins.
</P>
<P>
With preliminary construction plans adopted and the fund in
place, selection of the memorial site is now underway.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing is one of China's exceptionally large cities with a
history of more than 3,000 years. It is the largest economic
center and an important transportation hub in southwestern China
and on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
In 1940, Chongqing was made a "wartime capital" by the
Kuomintang government and was the political, economic, commercial,
financial, transportation, cultural, and diplomatic center of the
country at that time.

BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Municipal People's
Government will cut back its staff by 50 percent in order to
increase efficiency, and the 67 offices under the municipal
government will be reduced to 45.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) will cut down its working departments to 12 from 17, and the
number of employees at the Beijing Municipal Party Committee will

</P>
<P>
This organizational restructuring reform plan, mapped out in
accordance with the request of the CPC Central Committee and the
State Council, was just approved by the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the current organizational structure of the
Beijing municipal Party committee and the municipal government are
inefficient and have overlapping functions.
</P>
<P>
The reform is aimed at building a cooperative, simple, and
scientific and efficient operational system. To meet the demands
of developing Beijing's economy and building the city into an
international metropolis, the Beijing municipal government will
establish an administrative management system that accords with
the socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
The city will carry out this reform plan in the first quarter
this year, and laid-off employees will be reassigned within three
years.

<HEADLINE> SW China Invites Overseas High-Tech Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, January 27 (Xinhua)-- The Chongqing Economic and
Technological Development Zone (CETDZ) in southwest China is
inviting more high-tech projects to accelerate industrial growth
and promote the export of high-value-added products.
</P>
<P>
Machinery processing has been the only pillar industry here
during the initial stage since the founding of the development
zone in 1990. In recent years, high-tech sectors including
information and electronics, bio-engineering, pharmaceuticals,
environmental protection, and new materials research have
witnessed rapid growth with large amounts of overseas investment,
according to Wang Mingying, director general of the CETDZ Trade
Development Office.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the development zone introduced more than
64 million U.S. dollars last year, 62 percent of which was
invested in high-tech projects. Among 13 overseas enterprises
established in the zone in 1999, seven were engaged in advanced
technological research and exploitation ventures.
</P>
<P>
The gross industrial output value of the development zone
reached nearly six billion yuan (about 723 million U.S. dollars)
last year, with high-tech industries accounting for nearly one-
quarter, up five percent over 1998.
</P>
<P>
At present, telecommunications, automobiles and motorcycles,
food processing, and pharmaceuticals and bio-engineering are the
four pillar industries of the development zone, which aims to
achieve ten billion yuan in gross domestic product (GDP) by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The CETDZ initiated this campaign of developing advanced
technological sectors and foreign trade exchange in order to adapt
to the challenges in the new century, said Wang.

MANILA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada and former president Fidel Ramos joined religious leaders
Wednesday in calling for "national unity" and putting an end to
political differences, the nation's leading newspaper Business
World said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In his speech during the National Prayer Breakfast at the

YANGON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Myanmar military
official Wednesday stressed the need to have a modern, strong and
qualified army to safeguard a peaceful, stable, modern and
developed nation.
</P>
<P>
At a prize presentation ceremony here honoring winners of
military band competitions, Lieutenant-General Tin Oo, Chief of
Bureau of Special Operations and Chief of Staff of the Myanmar
Army, said the nation is modernizing the army and uplifting its
qualification for the nation to be free from aggressions and to
win esteem of the neighbors and to defend itself.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that Myanmar fell under subjugation as the country
had no permanent army in the past, emphasizing the importance of
building up military might by developing countries for regional
security as big countries are applying domination practices.
</P>
<P>
The general urged the armymen even better to respect and
observe the union spirit, warning that the national solidarity
will break up in the absence of union spirit and the nation will
lose independence and sovereignty again, making it impossible to
build a modern and developed nation.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's second
largest guerrilla group, the National Liberation Army (ELN), has
demanded that the government establish a demilitarized zone in the
north of the country to facilitate the relaunch of a balked peace
process, a parliamentary source said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Member of the ELN's central commando, Pablo Beltran, made the
demand at a meeting Tuesday with a Colombian parliamentary
delegation, which acts as mediator to save a preliminary peace
accord signed by the rebel group and Colombia's civil associations
in July 1998.

<P>
During the meeting, which took place in Caracas, capital city
of neighboring Venezuela, Beltran reiterated the need for a
demilitarized zone in a jungle area of Bolivar department, said
senator Carlos Espinosa Faciolince, one of the parliamentary
delegates.
</P>
<P>
The ELN asked for the withdrawal of the military and police
from four townships, among those San Pablo with an area of close
to 6,000 square kilometers.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese White Dolphin Fighting Solitude for 20 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Qiqi jumped out of water, his
silver body making a beautiful arc in the air before diving into
the water to splash sprays as a welcome to the visitors who have
come to see him at his home in a pool by Donghu Lake In Wuhan in
central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
Qiqi is a white-finned dolphin, a species unique to China, and
the most endangered dolphin species in the world. Qiqi is the only
one living in captive.
</P>
<P>
Hosting visitors from time to time excites Qiqi. The lonely
male dolphin has survived alone in the 300 sq.m. pool for 20 years,
since he was rescued in 1980 in Dongting Lake near China's longest
river, the Yangtze, which is the species' main habitat.
</P>
<P>
When he was found, Qiqi was a badly bruised two-year-old.
Experts examining him suspected the injuries were caused by
illegal fishing, which has been condemned as one of the main
contributors to the diminishing number of white dolphins in the
wild, from some 400 in the early 1980s to far less than 100 now.
</P>
<P>
The Fishery Bureau of the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture has
warned that the ancient mammal species which has survived 20 to 30
million years of evolution may face extinction within another 25
years unless effective measures are immediately enforced.
</P>
<P>
Qiqi is old now, considering the average life-span of 30 years
for white dolphins. Springtime is still hard for him, as he longs
for a mate. His caretakers worry that disorders resulting from
solitude may be dangerous and cause serious complications.
</P>
<P>
China has tried every means to save the white dolphins. The
Fishery Bureau has carried out a program monitoring Yangtze white-
fin dolphins every November since 1997, the largest such
monitoring program of rare animals in China, with the search
conducted over a 1,900-km-long stretch of the middle and lower
reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
However, only five to seven dolphins have been sighted each
season, even with the use of advanced devices.
</P>
<P>
The white dolphins are still struggling in a deteriorating
environment, in addition to constant life-threatening escapes from
illegal fishermen and the disturbance of the busy waterways of the
Yangtze. Because of these conditions, several of Qiqi's
prospective mates died before ever meeting him.
</P>
<P>
Qiqi might not have survived in his natural habitat. His
present good health is due in part to routine monthly physical
check-ups, and the meticulous care he receives in his artificial
environment, which has cost over 10 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
To sustain the species' longevity, scientists from the Chinese
Academy of Sciences is experimenting cloning a white dolphin.
Zhang Xianfeng, an academician in charge of the project, said
this is theoretically feasible, and his team is creating up a data
bank of white-dolphin cell information in preparations for the
final test.
</P>
<P>
He said that experts from the United States, Germany, and
Switzerland have been ardent in providing their expertise in
support of projects designed to save this severely endangered
species.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientists Create RNA Computer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- A computer using the
biological molecule RNA to solve complex problems was developed by
a U.S. research team, marking a significant advance in molecular
computing, the Science Daily reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The computer, developed by Princeton University researchers,
was a test tube containing 1,024 different strands of RNA, a
genetic material.
</P>
<P>
In work to be published in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, the scientists used the test-tube computer to
solve a simple version of the "Knight problem," a chess puzzle
that asks how many and where one can place knights on a chessboard
so they cannot attack each other.
</P>
<P>
For their experiment, the researchers restricted the board to
nine squares, leaving 512 possible combinations.
</P>
<P>
Of these, the RNA computer correctly found 43 solutions.
</P>
<P>
The test-tube computer does not have any immediate applications,
and it will probably never completely replace silicon-based
computers, said assistant professor Laura Landweber who led the
research team.
</P>
<P>
However, it does have attractive aspects. One advantage, said
Landweber, is that RNA and another genetic molecule DNA, which
encode all the instructions for creating and running life, can
store much more data in a given space than conventional memory
chips.
</P>
<P>
With vast numbers of genetic fragments of DNA and RNA floating
in a test tube, a biomolecular computer could perform thousands or
millions of calculations at the same time.
</P>
<P>
DNA computing has attracted considerable attention from
researchers since 1994 when Leonard Adleman of the University of
Southern California used DNA to solve a traveling salesman problem.
Some 10 research teams are now engaged in the development of
molecular computing in America.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Trade between Mexico and
Singapore reached an unprecedented volume of 1.28 billion U.S.
dollars last year, Singapore's Trade Development Board (TDB) said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries showed an upturn trend, even
though Mexico closed the year with a deficit of 102.3 million
dollars, according to a TDB report available here.
</P>
<P>
The unfavorable balance resulted from Mexico's imports from
Singapore, worth 692 million dollars, surpassing its exports to
that country, worth 589.7 million dollars, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's imports from Singapore rose 37 percent while exports
grew only 10.33 percent in the said year.
</P>
<P>
Mexico became Singapore's largest Latin American trade partner
in the year, as trade between the two countries surpassed the
combined total of Singapore's trade with Brazil, Argentina and
Chile.
</P>
<P>
Last September, during a bilateral meeting within the APEC (
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) forum in New Zealand,
Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong proposed to Mexican
President Ernesto Zedillo the establishment of a free trade
agreement (FTA) between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two governments are scheduled to hold negotiations in March
or April in a bid to reach an accord of investment promotion and
protection, which will lay the basis for an FTA.

<HEADLINE> Montenegro's Parallel Currency Policy Unconstitutional: Yugoslav Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Constitutional
Court of Yugoslavia ruled on Wednesday that Montenegro violated
the Constitution when it decided last November to use German mark
as a parallel currency with Yugoslav dinar.
</P>
<P>
That decision violates the federal Bank Law and regulations on
foreign currency circulation, the court said.
</P>
<P>
Another decision made by Montenegro, one of the republics of
the Yugoslav Federation, was to let its own people's bank to take
over all local functions of the Yugoslav People's Bank. This was
also unconstitutional, the court said.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Montenegro made the decision on November 2 ,1999,
the Yugoslav People's Bank, the country's central bank, requested
the federal constitutional court to render an adjudication on the
issue, saying that Montenegro's decision violated the Constitution
and could create serious problems for the federal monetary and
foreign currency systems.
</P>
<P>
The federal Bank Law prohibits companies operating within
Yugoslavia from doing foreign currency transactions. But
Montenegrin officials said that the parallel currency policy was
designed to protect the economy and the interests of the people
and to avoid hyperinflation.

<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen member states of the
Inter-American Tropical Tuna Convention (CIAT) began a meeting
here Wednesday to revise tuna fishing quotas and explore ways to
limit tuna capture in face of the growing capacity of fishing
fleets.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day work meeting, the participants are
expected to propose alternatives on tuna capture limitation and
give advice to next June's CIAT assembly on regulating fishing
operations.
</P>
<P>
CIAT imposed a restriction on the capture of yellow-fin tuna in
1998 and renewed the measure last year, said CIAT director Robin
Allen.
</P>
<P>
Yellow-fin tuna accounts for nearly 60 percent of all tuna
catch every year in the Tropical Eastern Pacific, which extends

<HEADLINE> China to Establish AIDS, Venereal Disease Prevention System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, January 27 (Xinhua) -- China plans to establish an
AIDS and venereal disease (VD) prevention and control system in an
effort to curb the spread of the HIV virus via blood-supply
channels, and keep the annual VD growth rate under 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Liu Kangmai, assistant to the director of the AIDS Prevention
and Control Center of the Ministry of Health, revealed the plan,
which was adopted at a national conference on AIDS and venereal
disease education held recently in Guiyang, capital of southwest
China's Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that under the plan, China expects to curb the spread
of HIV virus among drug-addicts by the year 2002 and lower the
annual incidence of venereal disease over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The AIDS prevention system will consist of an AIDS monitoring
network, a blood examination system, and a training center for
medical personnel.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, all hospitals in major cities and AIDS-
plagued areas are called on to improve their AIDS treatment and
consultations, and their professional training.
</P>
<P>
The plan also calls for extensive education on the prevention
of AIDS and venereal disease in high schools and secondary
vocational schools throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
China had 15,088 reported HIV cases by the end of September
last year, with 477 full-blown AIDS patients, 240 of whom died.
</P>
<P>
However, experts estimate that there are more than 400,000 HIV
carriers in China.
</P>
<P>
Compared to the global figure of 50 million total AIDS patients
and HIV carriers, China is still regarded as a low-infection area.
Nevertheless, experts warn that if effective measures are not
taken, China may be devastated by the disease in the new century,
with the number of HIV carriers skyrocketing to 10 million in
China.

<HEADLINE> Artificial Seawater for Prawn Breeding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JI'NAN, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Large tracts of saline-alkali
land in China's Yellow River Delta were left barren for ages with
no economic value, until recently.
</P>
<P>
 Scientists are now combining salt water with fresh water to
create an artificial seawater suitable for breeding aquatic
products.
</P>
<P>
 In Kenli County of Shandong Province in east China, farmers,
with the help of scientists, have made use of 21 hectares of
barren land to breed prawns. As a result, each hectare has turned
out 116,500 yuan (about 13,915 U.S. dollars) worth of prawns, 12
times the average level of areas along the coast.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Fazhen, a scientist at the Chinese Academy of Engineering,
said that breeding of prawns in ponds in interior areas can be
made immune to certain infections if they are raised in seawater,
and this will also prevent sea pollution and greatly raise the
unit yield.
</P>
<P>
The county plans to reclaim another 45 hectares of barren land
for prawn breeding to promote local economic development this year.

YINCHUAN, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The cultural relics department
has called for efforts to protect the Xumishan grotto, one of
China's ten largest grottos, in Guyuan County in northwest China's
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The grotto, built between the Northern Wei Dynasty (386-534)
and the Tang Dynasty (618-907), has been deteriorating due to both
natural and human factors over the past years.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the lack of fund and appropriate protective measures
has exacerbated the problem.
</P>
<P>
The 150 caves scatted over eight mountain peaks have more than
350 Buddhist statues and were listed as a key state-level cultural
site in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in 1984, relevant departments have allocated over 5
million yuan to preserve the caves, but Guyuan County, a poor area,
has not invested in the work for financial reasons, and the 100,
000 yuan revenue from ticket sales every year is not enough to
cover the cost of maintenance of the historic site.

LANZHOU, January 27 (Xinhua) -- An underground museum
displaying frescos, funerary objects and sculptures unearthed from
tombs of different feudal dynasties is being built at Jiuquan
Prefecture in northwest China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
Covering an area of 6.4 square kilometers, the museum is
comprised of 27 tombs filled with both imitated and valuable real
burial objects excavated from tombs between the Han and Jin
dynasties (206 B.C.- 420).
</P>
<P>
"We want the museum to reflect the prosperity of these two
historical periods and highest level of grave building in ancient
China," said an official in charge of the project.
</P>
<P>
The project will cost 10 million yuan (some 1.2 million US
dollars). When the project is completed in 2001, Jiuquan is
expected to attract more visitors with the underground gallery.
</P>
<P>
The area is also famed for the Mogao Grottoes at Dunhuang,
popularly known as the Thousand Buddha Caves, carved out of the
rocks stretching for about 1,600 metres along the eastern side of
Mingsha Hill.
</P>
<P>
Jiuquan Prefecture on the ancient Silk Road has 252 well-
preserved ancient tombs dating as far back as the Neolithic Age.
Their architecture, shape, interior paintings and folk customs are
unique compared with tombs in other parts of China.

slalom finals respectively on Wednesday in a FIS World Cup
snowboard competition in Tandadalen, Sweden.

<P>
Under sunny skies, Bozzetto beat Felix Stadler of Austria for
his season-high third win. Bozzetto, last year's overall champion,
leads compatriot Nicolas Huet 3,940 points to 3,160 in the cup

Defending world champion Richard Richardsson lost to Huet by
four-hundredths of a second in the 16th round and eventually round
up 11th. Huet finished third.

Fingerlos beat Isabelle Blanc in the women's giant slalom final.
However, Blanc has a commanding overall lead, 4,600 points to 3,

<HEADLINE> Azerbaijan Might Be Suspended, Blatter Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 26 (Xinhua) -- FIFA president Sepp Blatter
threatened to suspend Azerbaijan's soccer federation (ASF) on
Wednesday if they could not resolve the internal problems.
</P>
<P>
"I have no choice but to call on our emergency committee and I'
m sure that tomorrow it will follow the proposal by the FIFA
president and the ASF will be suspended," Blatter said in a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
Azeri soccer was split into two rival groups. The rebels, led
by the powerful presidents of champions Kepez Ganja and Turan
Tavuz, ignored FIFA's plea for a peaceful solution and went on a
collision course with the ASF.
</P>
<P>
"We must make the governmental authorities listen to the
national associations if they want to remain part of international
football," the FIFA chief said.

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu Combats Pollution by Acid Rain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Provincial
government are taking measures to put the pollution by acid rain
under control in the province.
</P>
<P>
The measures include intense supervision over the operation of
48 major coal-consuming power plants and other key industrial
enterprises that release an excess of sulphur dioxide, a leading
cause of air pollution.
</P>
<P>
These enterprises must meet the limits for sulphur dioxide
emission by the end of June, a local official said.
</P>
<P>
Acid rain, which is blamed for the release of the industrial
pollutants and sulphur dioxide from industrial enterprises, has
been a threat to health in many cities and counties in the
province. So far, 17 cities in Jiangsu have been included on the
State acid rain control plan.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that about 20 percent of the cities and
counties in Jiangsu are affected by acid rain each year.
</P>
<P>
Rainfall with a pH (a measure of acidity and alkalinity) lower
than 5.6 is regarded as acid rain in China.

for harmful waste.
</P>
<P>
According to agreements between the Chinese and Swiss

Each of the treatment plants involves a total of 50 million
yuan (6 million US dollars) in total investment, with incinerators
that can handle 40 tons of waste a day, using Swiss technology and
equipment.
</P>
<P>
Harmful waste has posed a serious threat to the environment in
the three cities in recent years.

LONDON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- American boxer Mike Tyson and
his entourage arrived in Manchester on Wednesday night to a loud
welcome from some 700 fans.
</P>
<P>
The crowd had waited for up to three hours outside the Midland
Hotel in Manchester to get a glimpse of Tyson, who is due to fight
British champion Julius Francis in the city's MEN Arena on

But Tyson's fans were left disappointed as his handlers bundled
him in through a back door.

Tyson, who was convicted of rape in the United States in 1992,
has grabbed the headlines almost every day since flying in to
scenes of hysteria at London's Heathrow Airport on 16 January.
</P>

He was allowed into Britain after Home Secretary Jack Straw
personally intervened.

<HEADLINE> Baggio Sees Future at Inter Milan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Roberto Baggio has vowed to
fight for his Inter Milan future on the day he has been linked
with a loan move to Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
The Italian ace has been out of favour this season with Inter
boss Marcello Lippi but came off the bench on Sunday to score his
first goal of the campaign and Inter's winner in a crucial 2-1
victory at Verona. Now Baggio believes he could be back in Lippi's
plans, following claims he had fallen out with the manager and was
a disruptive influence in the dressing room.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old former World Cup star said: "I have never
raised the white flag with Lippi, I'm ready to fight for my place.
If in life you don't fight for things, then there is no chance of
you winning and being able to build something."
</P>
<P>
Baggio rubbished claims of a fall out with his boss and that he
's a troublemaker in the squad, saying: "You saw the way my team-
mates jumped all over me after I scored, and Lippi shook my hand
afterwards. I believe that everything I experienced after that
goal was sincere.
</P>
<P>
"It has been said that I cause trouble in the dressing room,
but now people will have to invent something else. In 18 years in
football I have heard many stupid things, but people should know
the truth.
</P>
<P>
"I accept Lippi's choices, as long as they are honest choices.
It is his job to make decisions."
</P>
<P>
While Baggio is talking about the rebirth of his career at
Inter, there are claims that Liverpool are interested in taking
him on loan as a stop-gap measure to cope with the injuries to
both Michael Owen and Robbie Fowler.
</P>
<P>
Anfield boss Gerard Houllier is known to be scouring Europe in
search of a loan deal, not surprisingly because it is his only
source of top-quality help for his injury-hit squad as under FA
rules Premiership clubs can't sign loan players, except
goalkeepers, from their own league.
</P>
<P>
But with the Champions League and UEFA Cup competitions due to
start again shortly, and work permits required for any player
outside the EU with the transfer deadline only eight weeks away,
Houllier's choices are severely limited.
</P>
<P>
Now it seems that Baggio has eyes for an Inter revival. He
added: "It is not a question of a resurrection in my career, I
never died in the first place."

<HEADLINE> Participation in Multilateral Talks Useless: Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim
Hoss said his country saw no use in participating the multilateral
talks, which are scheduled to resume in Moscow early February.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the multilateral talks committee on refugee
affairs focus only on the refugee humanitarian issues rather than
their return to their homes, Hoss told reporters here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon seeks a final solution to the problem of the Palestinian
refugees under the international laws that provide for their
return, he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Lebanon briefed all parties concerned, especially
the U.S., on this position. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Thomas
Pickering assured Lebanon in a message that peace would not be at
its expense, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli daily Ha'artz said Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat offered the U.S. a plan on the final status talks, in which
he agreed to a settlement with Israel recognizing the
Palestinians' "right to return" with a suspended enforcement. The
settlement means that the refugees would remain where they are.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon, which hosts at present a total of 400,000 Palestinian
refugees at 12 camps nationwide, has demanded that Israel agree to
the return of the refugees to their homeland. Israel has repeatedly
rejected the return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
The multilateral Middle East talks will discuss issues of common
interests including demilitarization, water resources, refugees and
environment protection. 
</P>
<P>
The first multilateral negotiations were convened in Moscow in
January 1992 within the framework of Madrid conference. But the
talks were frozen, together with bilateral negotiations, in early
1996 as the whole peace process came to a halt following a series
of terrorist attacks in Israel carried out by Islamic militants. 
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, which boycotted the multilateral talks from
the outset, refused to attend the Moscow talks, saying such
meetings were meaningless if they have not made peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Syrian-Israeli peace talks that resumed last December have hit a
snag, with the third round of negotiations postponed indefinitely.
On the Palestinian track, the talks on a final peace deal were
sluggish though the February 13 deadline for a framework agreement
on the permanent peace deal is at hand.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Acknowledges Globalization Negative Aspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations acknowledged
that the costs of globalization are bigger than its benefits, said
Oscar de Rojas, general supervisor of the international
organization's Economic and Social Affairs Department, Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The globalization increased the marginalization of countries
and persons, the asymetries between the industrialized economies
and those in development, as well as the injustices produced by
this model, said De Rojas before the International Encounter of
Economists in Havana.
</P>
<P>
Rojas said that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan shares the
concerns for the economic development problems within the
globalization.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief told those attending the forum the negotiations
in progress to improve the living standards in the developing
countries and in those less advanced.
</P>
<P>
De Rojas said that the discussion in the U.N. General Assembly
about the feasibility of development in the context of the
globalization started two years ago, while the most developed
countries have been urged to engage in a more effective
international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Globalization by itself does not guarantee equality and social
justice, although on the opinion of the U.N. secretary-general it
opens possibilities to promote development in many fields of human
activity, especially for the advance of technology of information
and communications.
</P>
<P>
Some 400 specialists from more than 50 countries and 200 Cuban
delegates and foreign guests take part in the Second International
Encounter of Economists that will end Friday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Meet Arafat at Davos Economic Forum  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said that Clinton will
meet with Arafat at the World Economic Forum, an annual gathering
for world leaders in Davos, Switzerland, but as Barak will not
attend the forum, chances for Clinton's meeting with him is out of
the question.
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe that Prime Minister Barak will be in Davos.
Chairman Arafat will be in Davos and I think he'll meet with
Chairman Arafat," Berger said at a White House special briefing.
</P>
<P>
He said as Clinton will be at the forum for only a few hours on
Saturday, there would probably be "some sort of larger reception
in which the president has the opportunity to talk to a number of
people including, certainly, (Jordan's) King Abdullah."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Clinton would raise specific proposals for the
Middle East peace process in his State of the Union address later
on Thursday, Berger said: "He will keep very much within the
spirit of his admonition, 'Less said, more done.'"

<HEADLINE> UN Court Gives Life-Term to Rwanda Genocide Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The International
Criminal Tribunal on Rwanda (ICTR) sentenced Thursday the former
director of the Rwandan state-owned tea factory to life
imprisonment for his role in the 1994 Rwanda Genocide.
</P>
<P>
Alfred Musema, 51, was found guilty of three counts, genocide,
 extermination and rape, out of nine charges, said sources from
Arusha, in northern Tanzania where the ICTR located.
</P>
<P>
Musema participated and encouraged his employees in attacks
against the ethnic Tutsis, said the court presided by Jude Yakov
Ostrosky, adding that he also incurred individual crimes including
rape.
</P>
<P>
However, Musema pleaded not guilty to all the charges and his
lawyer, Steven Kay, said he will lodge an appeal against the
verdict.
</P>
<P>
The judgement on Musema is the ICTR's seventh since its
creation on November 8, 1994 by the United Nations Security
Council resolution 955 and the first of this new year.
</P>
<P>
Arrested in Switzerland on February 11, 1995, Musema was first
handled by the Judicial authorities of the Swiss military until
the ICTR requested his transfer to the UN detention facilities in
Arusha.
</P>
<P>
Verdicts have already been handed down to six other Rwandan
genocide suspects, including the former Prime minister Jean
Kambanda, who was given a life imprisonment after pleading guilty
to charges of genocide.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR has the mandate to try persons suspected to be
responsible for genocide and other serious violations of the
international humanitarian law committed in the territory of
Rwanda between January 1 and December 31, 1994.
</P>
<P>
It also has the mandate to try Rwandan citizens responsible
for such violations committed in the territory of neighboring
states during the 100- day massacre which claimed more than
800,000 civilians mostly the ethnic Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR has so far issued 28 indictments against 45
individuals and a total of 38 indicted individuals are in custody.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Police Seize Large Drug Haul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Kenya police has seized an
estimated 4. 8 tons of hashish with a street value of more than
13.6 million U.S. dollars in the country's southeastern coast
city of Mombasa, media here reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The seizure was the largest drug bust in Mombasa since 20 tons
of hashish was found at the South Coast hamlet of Bodo in 1996,
the police said.
</P>
<P>
The drug was seized at an upmarket four-bedroom house in Nyali
Estate in the north Coast Wednesday, police said, adding that it
is believed that the drug is on its way to Europe, where it sells
at an even higher price.
</P>
<P>
District Commissioner Ole Legei described the seizure as a
break-through in the fight against drug abuse and trafficking in
the country..
</P>
<P>
Mombasa has become one of the most notorious conduits for
illegal drugs from the Middle and Far East due to Kenya's
relatively unguarded borders and the lack of a Coast guard to
monitor the long shoreline.
</P>
<P>
Legei noted the house where the haul was found had been broken
into and it was likely some of the drugs had already found their
way onto the local market.
</P>
<P>
The drug, which looks like chocolate, was packed in 4,800
sachets each of one kilogramme, ready for sale. It had been
packed in cartons with labels stating it was tomato sauce and
other foreign brand food bearing German and United States trade
marks.
</P>
<P>
Legei said no arrests had been made but police had launched a
major investigation to determine the origin and destination of
the drug haul, and appealed to the public, especially people
operating along the shore, to report any suspicious cargo to the
police.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's House of
Representatives Committee on the Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC)
violence has begun a fact- finding mission in Lagos, the Guardian
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The OPC is a radical ethnic group of the Yorubas, one of the
Nigeria's three largest nationalities.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the 14-member House committee, Malam Zailaini, said
here Wednesday that his team would contact people with diverse
opinions on the OPC issue.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Governor Bola Tinubu, the committee described
the activities of various militant groups in the most populous
African country as capable of tearing the nation apart.
</P>
<P>
Tinubu said that no governor would fold his arms and allow his
state to be taken over by hoodlums.
</P>
<P>
The committee should get to the root of the crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, some House representatives asked the federal
government to ban the radical ethnic groups including the OPC and
Arewa Peoples Congress (APC), which were believed to be behind the
recent ethinic conflicts in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
The conflicts between Yorubas, Hausas and Ijaws, other two
major ethnic groups in the west African country, had killed
hundreds of people in recent months.

<P>
LUSAKA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Angolan refugees at Mayukwayukwa
camp in Zambia's Western Province are selling guns to earn a
living, a Zambia daily Mail newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Villagers in the area buying the guns from the refugees and
reselling them to people who are traveling there, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Some refugees revealed that they hide arsenal on their way to
the camps in Zambia and retrieve the arms later after settling
down in camps.
</P>
<P>
The villagers around the refugee settlement alleged that some
refugees were crossing into the country with guns which they were
later selling to them for killing people.
</P>
<P>
They appealed to the Zambian government to help in tracking
down the criminals in the refugee camps.

BERLIN, January 27 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder met chairman of Germany's Central Council of Jews Paul
Spiegel on Thursday in Berlin. It is the first time that Spiegel
was received by the German chancellor after he was elected
chairman of Germany's Central Council of Jews on January 9.
</P>
<P>
 During the meeting, two vice-chairmen of the organization,
Mrs.Charlotte Knoblauch and Dr.Michel Friedman were also received
by Chancellor Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder and Spiegel discussed the financial aid for Germany'

difficult for the Federal Government to provide sufficient
financial supports for the organization of Jews in Germany under
the present situation.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Central Council of Jews, founded in 1950, is an
organization for safeguarding the interests of Jews in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Now there are 80,000 Jews living in Germany, but the relation
between the Jews and Non-Jews is not so good. There are 15 percent
of Germans who take an attitude of antisemitism.

<HEADLINE> Blix Formally Appointed to Lead Iraq Monitoring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Thursday afternoon formally appointed Hans Blix, a
former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, as the
chief inspector of a new disarmament commission for Iraq, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan announced.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, Annan, who is in Moscow on a three-
day visit to Russia, said that the president of the Security
Council for the month of January, Richard Holbrooke, told him in a
letter that Annan's selection of Blix was formally approved  by
the 15-nation body.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased to announce that Dr. Blix is appointed as
Executive Chairman of UNMOVIC (the United Nations Monitoring,
Verification and Inspection Commission)," Annan said, "I expect Dr.
Blix to take up his mandated tasks as soon as possible. Dr. Blix's
appointment will formally take effect upon his assumption of
duties."
</P>
<P>
Blix, 71, was travelling in Antarctica Wednesday. He told U.N.
officials that he would hold a news conference in Sweden early
next month when he returns.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Annan nominated Rolf Ekeus, another Sweden
disarmament expert supported by the United States, to the chief
inspector's job. But his nomination was blocked in the Security
Council by Russia and France.
</P>
<P>
Under the cease-fire resolution that ended the Gulf war in
1991, Iraq has to be certified free of all prohibited weapons
systems and the means to reconstruct them before sanctions imposed
in August 1990, after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, can be lifted.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Fall In Worries About Higher Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks finished
lower Thursday as investors expected that an increase in interest
rates by the Federal Reserve next week will be the first of
several this year.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average gave up early gains to close
down 4.97 at 11,028.02. The blue chip index rose as much as 130
points in the session.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index fell 5.53 at 1,398.56 and the technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index fell 30.35 at 4,039.56.
</P>
<P>
After a strong rally in the morning session, the market began
to fall as a government report on strong demands for durable goods
in December suggests that the expected rate hike will be the
first of several this year. The Commerce department reported that
orders to U.S. factories for big-ticket manufactured goods rose in
December, last year.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve Board raised rates three times in last year
to ward off inflation. Investors expected the board to raise
rates again at the next meeting on February 1-2 due to the hot
economy.
</P>
<P>
Disappointing earnings reports from some big-name tech
companies also helped the Nasdaq index lower. Dell Computer
reported late Wednesday that it will miss profit expectations this
quarter partly because of slower demands.
</P>
<P>
Qualcomm continued to fall today. The cellular phone chipmaker
said Wednesday its sales will be low this quarter, dragging its
stock prices lower.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 1.67 at 628.76 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 29.41 at 882.80. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 4.02 at 517.02.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,592 down, 1,465 up and 479

NYSE volume increased to 1.114 billion shares from 1.110

<HEADLINE> Cuba Denounces "Inhuman" Treatment to Grandmothers in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- "Granma," the Cuban Communist
Party daily, Thursday denounced as an "unjust and inhuman
treatment" the meeting held Wednesday by the Cuban boy Elian
Gonzalez and his two grandmothers in Florida.
</P>
<P>
Grandmothers Mariela Quintana and Raquel Rodrguez traveled
Wednesday from Washington to Miami for the meeting with their six-
year-old grandson, who had been retained in Miami for more than
two months.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was scheduled, as agreed upon by the grandmothers
and the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), to be
held at the residence of Sister Jeane O'Laughlin, rector of Barry
University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
As reported by "Granma," Elian Gonzalez entered a site designed
for the meeting accompanied by a nun and a blonde woman, "
something unexpected," because as agreed upon, two nuns should
have taken him to the site of the encounter.
</P>
<P>
The blonde woman is the daughter of Lazaro Gonzalez, a grand-
uncle of the boy,  said "Granma."
</P>
<P>
"Granma" described the woman as "hysterical and very well known
for her diatribes and insults against the true family of Elian,
which reclaims the boy."
</P>
<P>
Mariela ordered then the blonde woman to leave the room.
</P>
<P>
Elian's relatives, including his father, his grandfathers and
great-grandmother, reiterated in a message sent Wednesday to the
grandmothers before their travel to Miami that "under no
circumstances they must agree to meet or have any contact with
Lazaro, his daughter, or any other relative who supported the
child kidnapping."
</P>
<P>
"Granma" said that the grandmothers received "an inhuman
treatment" when security personnel of the residence took a cell
telephone from them through which the grandmothers and the boy had
talked with the relatives in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The grandmothers said that Elian left them a gratifying and
affectionate impression, although "the famous residence was for
them a prison and an isolation."
</P>
<P>
Elian was found clinging to an inner tube off the Florida
coast on Nov. 25. He had left Cuba with his mother, who died along
with her boyfriend and nine others when their boat capsized.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Leader Calls for Being Patient on Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams
warned on Thursday that the Northern Ireland peace process will be
put in jeopardy if devolution collapses.
</P>
<P>
Adams delivered the hard-hitting statement at the opening of
new Sinn Fein offices in Newry, County Down.
</P>
<P>
He urged the unionists to "be patient and have faith" over the
issue of the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons, which is
threatening to derail the newly formed coalition government.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that any move to collapse the new political
institutions, over lack of decommissioning, would be a big mistake.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no default on decommissioning," he said. "There
is no reason for the executive to collapse or for any minister to
resign."
</P>
<P>
He said a collapse of the executive or a "soft landing or
another review phase" would "create a political vacuum, reinforce
and encourage negative unionism, put the entire process into
jeopardy and make decommissioning even more difficult than it has
been so far".
</P>
<P>
Adams criticized unionists for using the arms issue as a "
political football" and claimed this had "set back" the goal of a
weapons handover.
</P>
<P>
The Sinn Fein leader also said that his party was "genuinely
committed" to resolving the arms issue but added: "It is a
fundamental mistake to try and force decommissioning by seeking to
marginalise a political party and its electorate."
</P>
<P>
Adams' comments came in the wake of speculation that the
government is drawing up plans to rush emergency legislation
through parliament to reimpose direct rule, the BBC reported.
</P>
<P>
This could take place if a report next Monday by General John
de Chastelain, head of the international decommissioning body
which is overseeing the process of disarmament, says there is no
advance on IRA disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The International Commission on Decommissioning has been
meeting representatives of republican and loyalist paramilitary
organizations to discuss the handover of terrorist weapons.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair has refused to speculate in public
about what could happen and urged everyone to wait for the report.
</P>
<P>
Decommissioning is the final piece of the jigsaw of
institutions to be put in the place under the terms of the
agreement.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Mixed Difficulties Stall Peace Process in DRC  (by Gu Zhenqiu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council's special meeting on the peace prospects in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) is drawing to an end Thursday without any
concrete new measures to bolster the frayed cease-fire agreement,
long sought by African leaders to stop the many-sided conflict in
the central African country.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited U.N. peace-keeping operation in DRC is still
yet to be put in place, even though the issue has been under
discussion in the Security Council so many times.
</P>
<P>
However, the 15-nation Security Council said in a presidential
statement adopted Wednesday that it would move quickly to approve
a resolution authoring the deployment of a U.N. military observer
mission in DRC.
</P>
<P>
In an unusual Security Council meeting, which kicked off
Monday, seven African heads of state and foreign ministers from
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) renewed their
commitment to a collapsing Lusaka Cease-fire Agreement that they
signed in July last year. The presidents were from Angola, Namibia,
Zimbabwe, DRC, Rwanda and Uganda, all involved in the conflict,
which broke out in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
The current conflict in DRC, which shares international
borders with nine other countries, is so large and intractable
that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright compared it to "
Africa's first world war."
</P>
<P>
Despite calls by African regional leaders for a quick
deployment of U.N. peace-keepers, and the Security Council's
promise to "act promptly," diplomats here said that the United
States, who holds the Council presidency for the month of January,
was far from approving the deployment pact and even the promised
resolution on the observer force would have to wait about two
weeks until the White House was given a green light by a reluctant
Congress.
</P>
<P>
The African presidents were invited to the U.N. Headquarters in
New York by Richard Holbrooke, but he told the press here that he
did not expect immediate results.
</P>
<P>
In fact, while the Security Council has been blaming
belligerents in DRC for its inability to authorize the deployment
of U.N. peace-keepers, the participating African leaders
criticized the U.N. body for not showing adequate support for the
peace process in the largest central African country, formerly
known as Zaire.
</P>
<P>
International assistance, including prompt and necessary U.N.
action, is badly needed to put an end to the DRC conflict, which
has largely affected the stability in the Great Lake region and
even Africa as a whole, but warring parties themselves bear
primary responsibility for adhering to commitments and creating
conditions conducive to progress in the much-stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
The DRC war is complicated, so are the difficulties in
bringing peace to the African country.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the lack of necessary resources on the ground,
there is distrust among warring parties. Rwanda, together with
Uganda, supported rebels in fighting against DRC President Laurent
Kabila, backed by Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the painstaking mediation efforts by African
countries and the international community, warring parties signed
the Lusaka Cease-fire Agreement. Since then, however, there have
been many cease-fire violations.
</P>
<P>
According to the Calendar for the implementation of the peace
accord, which the warring parties all had agreed upon, most of the
activities should have been completed by this time, including the
inter-Congolese national dialogue, the establishment of new
institutions, exchange of prisoners and disarmament of armed
groups.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the deployment of the U.N. peace-keepers
would long have begun and the orderly withdrawal of foreign troops
from DRC would be in the final stages of completion.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which would pay one-third the cost of a new
mission, insists that the budget be clear and the soldiers'
mandate well defined. Washington is hesitating on the deployment
decision as long as the conflict persists in DRC.
</P>
<P>
But several African presidents said that there can't be peace
without more U.N. help.
</P>
<P>
Time is of an essence at this stage as far as the DRC conflict
is concerned. It is largely accepted that any delay in U.N. action
would further worsen the situation, which has already been a grave
concern for the international community, in the war-torn African
nation.

<P>
Indeed, to free the DRC people from the war sufferings and
bring peace to the country remains a serious challenge confronting
the international community, especially the Security Council,
which, under the U.N. Charter, has the primary responsibility for
the maintenance of peace and security in the world at large.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations should throw in the necessary financial and
human resources as soon as possible to resolve the DRC conflict,
so as to avoid paying even higher price in the future. This is
crucial under the current circumstances and will be a critical
test of the Security Council's political will and determination in
this regard.
