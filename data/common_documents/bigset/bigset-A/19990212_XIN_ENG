<HEADLINE> U.S. Retail Sales Rise Modestly in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The January's retail sales
in U.S. rose a modest 0.2 percent to seasonally adjusted 232
billion U.S. dollars, the Commerce Department said on Thursday,
</P>
<P>
The increase, driven by the post-holiday discounts and clothing
shops, was in line with economists' expectations. It followed a
large 1 percent gain in December and dovetailed with their belief
that healthy economic growth at the end of 1998 is carrying over
into early 1999.
</P>
<P>
Conditions remain bright for continued robust sales.
Unemployment held at a 29-year low of 4.3 percent in January.
Interest rates remain low, stock prices high and inflation
contained.
</P>
<P>
While the overall increase in sales was relatively muted, sales
at department stores and other general merchandisers soared 1.5
percent, the biggest increase in 11 months.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report earlier this month, big discount chains
such as Wal-Mart, Target and Kmart recorded the strongest gains.
</P>
<P>
Clothing, shoe and accessory shops reported a 1 percent
increase in January, and drug stores, an 0.8 percent advance.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, auto sales rose 0.2 percent on top of a big
2.2 percent jump in January. Receipts at building-supply and
garden centers were unchanged after a healthy 1.9 percent gain in
December.
</P>
<P>
Furniture sales fell 0.4 percent, the worst performance in nine
months. They were strong through much of 1998, helped by spillover
from record home sales.
</P>
<P>
Also, sales fell 0.5 percent at food stores and 0.5 percent at
gas stations, reflecting the lowest gasoline prices in more than a
decade.

<P>
GENEVA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Participants to a World Trade
Organization (WTO) pact to liberalize the financial services
sector have put off their decision on the implementation date till
next Monday.
</P>
<P>
A meeting had been set for February 11 but missions of some of
the 54 participants who have ratified the pact indicated they
might not have received final instructions in time from their
capitals, said trade officials here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 54 are expected to agree to implement the deal, which
covers banking, insurance and related sectors, from March 1 as
originally planned.
</P>
<P>
Another 17 participants, including major players like Australia,
Brazil and Luxembourg, who signed the deal in December 1997 have
not yet completed ratification procedures, which were due to have
been over by the end of January. They are expected to be given an
extension.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Jets Attack Iraqi Targets in Northern No-Fly Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Following Wednesday's
bombing at Iraqi air defense site, U.S. fighter jets launched new
attacks on Thursday against at least five Iraqi targets in the
northern no-fly zone, including two communications sites and a
surface-to-air missile system.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Steve Campbell said there was no
damage to U.S. aircraft and no injuries to U.S. pilots. Damage
to Iraqi forces was currently being assessed.
</P>
<P>
In the first incident, between about 12:15 p.m. and 12:30
p.m. (0915 and 0930 GMT), a U.S. Air force F-15E strike Eagle
observed Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery fire and was
"illuminated" by an Iraqi radar system near the northern city of
Mosul.
</P>
<P>
"Acting in self-defense, one F-15E dropped four GBU12
precision-guided bombs on a surface-to-air missile
communications site," a Defense Department statement said. Two
other F-15Es launched a missile and dropped four bombs on an
Iraqi surface-to-air missile system.
</P>
<P>
An hour later, U.S. pilots retaliated in three separate
incidents, with F-15Es bombing a SAM site and a communications
site, and an Air force F-16CJ launching a high-speed
anti-radiation missile at an Iraqi radar site.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Starts Last Day Debate on Clinton's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Poised to acquit U.S.
President Bill Clinton, senators returned Thursday to their secret
deliberations on the impeachment trial with the lone remaining
drama centering on whether even a simple majority will vote for
his conviction and removal from office.
</P>
<P>
Majority Leader Trent Lott said 37 senators had yet to speak
and that his hopes for a vote on Thursday had dimmed. "I don't
think that is going to be possible at this time," he told senators
before the sergeant-at-arms closed the chamber doors for the
debate.
</P>
<P>
That would leave the vote on whether to convict and oust
Clinton for Friday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in the two
articles of impeachment in connection with his relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The two articles were
approved by the House along partisan lines on December 19 last
year.
</P>
<P>
With Republican hopes for a 67-vote conviction margin now just
a distant memory, attention turned to the struggle for a mere
majority -- a legally empty result that nevertheless would offer
rebuffed House prosecutors a symbolic achievement for their uphill
work.
</P>
<P>
Three Republicans said Wednesday they will not vote to convict
Clinton. If three more do so and all 45 Democrats vote to acquit,
the articles would fall short of a majority. Opinion polls have
shown consistently that about two-thirds of the public think
Clinton shouldn't be convicted and removed.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half the 100 senators had not addressed their colleagues
after the second day of closed-door deliberations ended Wednesday.
Votes on the articles were possible late Thursday, but senators
were prepared to delay the verdict until Friday. The votes would
be in open session.
</P>
<P>
If acquitted, there is a chance that Clinton would face no
formal rebuke by the Senate. A Democratic initiative to censure
Clinton struggled for survival under Republican resistance.
</P>
<P>
Senator Joseph Lieberman, a Democrat, said that if Republican
leaders prevent a censure vote, supporters might simply draft a
declaration condemning the president's behavior and circulate it
for senators to sign.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's session spanned eight hours with several breaks
along the way. More than 30 senators spoke, with most taking the
maximum 15 minutes allotted and some reminded by Chief Justice
William Rehnquist's gavel that time had expired. The first day of
deliberations on Tuesday covered a period of slightly more than
four hours.

<HEADLINE> Civilians Killed in U.S.-British Missile Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Two Iraqi civilians were
killed and several others injured on Thursday when U.S.-British
warplanes attacked civilian targets in northern Iraq, an Iraqi
military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was quoted by the Iraqi News Agency as saying
that at 11:35 a.m. local time (0835 GMT), 11 formations of
U.S.-British warplanes from a Turkish military base violated
Iraq's northern airspace and fired 16 missiles at the Iraqi air
defense sites in Dohuk and Neineva provinces.
</P>
<P>
U.S.-British warplanes, supported by early warning planes, also
launched missiles at civilian targets in Neineva province, said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iraqi anti-aircraft units and warplanes
counter-attacked U.S.-British warplanes and hit one of them,
forcing the rest to flee.
</P>
<P>
Around noon, nine formations of U.S.-British warplanes from
Saudi and Kuwaiti bases violated Iraq's southern airspace, said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, one Iraqi civilian was killed and several others
injured when U.S. warplanes attacked the southern Iraqi city of
Najaf.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its allies imposed no-fly zones in Iraq in the
wake of the 1991 Gulf War, with a claimed aim to protect the Kurds
in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from "Baghdad's
suppression."
</P>
<P>
In mid-December the U.S. and Britain air-raided Iraq to
retaliate what they claimed Iraq's non-cooperation with U.N. arms
inspectors in charge of eliminating prohibited weapons.
</P>
<P>
After the air attacks, Iraq announced that it does not
recognize the no-fly zones and would fire at patrolling U.S. and
British jets. Clashes between Iraqi air defense units and
U.S.-British warplanes have almost become daily occurrences.
</P>
<P>
Last month, U.S. and British warplanes bombed three
residential quarters in southern Iraq, killing dozens of civilians
and injuring nearly 100 others.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said earlier Thursday
that Iraq would go on confronting U.S.-British warplanes violating
Iraqi airspace regardless of the sacrifices.

<P>
DHAKA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- One person was killed and over
100 people were injured on Thursday in the last day of the
opposition-sponsored 60-hour hartal (general strike) across
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The person was killed in northwest Chittagong district in
clashes between pro- and anti-hartal activists, and a policeman,
who received bomb injuries during hartal hours on Tuesday, died in
a hospital here on Thursday, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
In the capital city, five to 10 people were injured during a
clash between activists of the Jamaat-e-Islami and the ruling
Bangladesh Awami League, and about 90 people were arrested across
the country during the shutdown.
</P>
<P>
Despite sporadic clashes, life was fairly normal in Dhaka, with
large numbers of rickshaws and some buses plying on the streets.
Banks, financial institutions and most private offices operated
normally, but educational institutions still remained closed.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance, comprising the major opposition
--Bangladesh Nationalist Party, the Jatiya Party, the
Jamaat-e-Islami and others, called the countrywide hartal to press
home their four-point demand, including replacement of the chief
election commissioner, for joining the country's municipal
elections scheduled to be held later this month.

<TEXT>
<P>
Referring to the recommendations by a government-invited
international advisory panel to slash the original time-frame for
opening up the banking sector from five years to three years, Lee
said MAS will be sticking to the original time-frame but making
bold moves in the earliest years.
</P>
<P>
He also said MAS is reviewing all restrictions in domestic
banking including limits on opening additional branches, setting
up off-premises ATMs and participating in shared ATM network.
</P>
<P>
MAS will review the rules governing foreign banks granted
offshore licenses to see how reputable bank can have greater
access to the domestic market, Lee added.
</P>
<P>
Lee conceded present regulations for local banks are more
generous in certain instances than for foreign banks
</P>
<P>
But Lee argued that foreign banks already have wide access to
his country's banking sector, saying they enjoy more than a third
of total resident deposits, 45 percent of loans to resident
borrowers and the bulk of the business with non-residents.
</P>
<P>
Lee expressed the hopes that more than one local bank will
develop a significant presence in Asian and international markets
and strengthen their capabilities in corporate banking and
non-traditional, free-based business.
</P>
<P>
He said MAS will give a push to developing fund management. He
said the Government Investment Corporation (GIC) has placed out a
total of 16.9 billion Singapore dollars (about 10 billion U.S.
dollars) to fund management companies with offices in Singapore as
at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The GIC had placed out 6.8 billion Singapore dollars (about 4
billion U.S. dollars) last year after it had announced last
February that it would place out 25 billion Singapore dollars
(about 15 billion U.S. dollars) over the next three years, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Europe's Largest Steelmaker to Come in to Being </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Lower Saxony state
Economics Minister Peter Fischer confirmed Thursday that talks
were underway on a possible merger of the Salzgitter AG steel
company with the Arbed group of Luxembourg, which led to create a
Europe's largest steelmaker.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Salzgitter's two chief shareholders, Lower
Saxony and the North German State Bank (Nord/LB), and Arbed have
been underway since December 23, according to a report of the
German Press Agency.
</P>
<P>
In a merger, Arbed would gain a clear majority of Salzgitter,
the company which was separated from the Preussag concern last
year in a transaction in which Lower Saxony and Nord/LB acquired
controlling interest to avoid a takeover by the Austrian company
Voest.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, of the state's ruling Social Democrats (SPD), drew a
contrast between the two transactions.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the effort to ward off Voest which would have
meant the "selloff" of Salzgitter, the talks with Arbed were aimed
at achieving a partnership, he said.
</P>
<P>
A stock swap would give Lower Saxony and Nord/LB the second
biggest stake in Arbed after the 30 percent share owned by
Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
Under the Arbed umbrella, a steel holding to be led by
Salzgitter would be established, to include Arbed's two steel
holdings in Germany, one in Bremen the other in the state of
Thueringen.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Arbed was Europe's second largest steel producer at 19
million tons. Adding Salzgitter's 4.9 million tons capacity would
create Europe's largest steel concern, surpassing
Usinor-Cockerill, at 22.9 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Lower Saxony and Nord/LB between them own a 67 percent stake in
Salzgitter.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Christian Democratic Union and Greens politicians
demanded an immediate public explanation by Lower Saxony Premier
Gerhard Glogowski about the Arbed talks.
</P>
<P>
Union officials were also alarmed, warning they would try to
block any merger which did not assure the workers' side of
influence in management decisions under current German steel
industry rules.

<HEADLINE> European Parliament Member Visits Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 11 (Xinhua) -- European Parliament member
Glenys Kinnoick has started her three-day working visit in
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Kinnoick, who is also vice chairman of the joint assembly of
the European Union - African, Caribbean and Pacific countries
(EU-ACP), arrived here Wednesday from Frankfurt, Germany, local
Noticias newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After her meeting with Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano
Wednesday, Kinnoick said she is collecting data for a report which
will later be the framework for cooperations between European
Union (EU) countries and southern African countries, especially
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The EU is willing to promote its cooperative relations with
southern Africa, said Kinnoick, adding that Mozambique should take
advantage of this willingness to expand cooperation with the EU.
</P>
<P>
Kinnoick mentioned that most of southern Africa used to be the
colonies of European countries, therefore, Europe, as the
so-called "old continent", has the obligation to provide basis for
the security and political, social and economic stability for the
region so that countries in the region could implement their
development programs in a peaceful and harmonious atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
She also pledged that the EU will continue to support the

<HEADLINE> Back Pain May Be Genetic, Study Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Up to 60 percent of back pain
could be caused by faulty genes, a new British study suggests.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at St Thomas' Hospital in London studied 400 set of
twins, and found that identical twins with back problems often
have similar symptoms and worn-out discs in exactly the same
position of the spine.
</P>
<P>
The study, published in the Arthritis and Rheumatism journal,
measured disc degeneration in the neck and lower back with
magnetic resonance imaging scans.
</P>
<P>
The analysis showed genes accounted for about 60 percent of the
risk of developing arthritic discs in the spine.
</P>
<P>
Dr Tim Spector, director of the hospital's Twin Research Unit,
said although occupation, posture and injuries obviously played a
role in some people, the study showed a worn out disc was largely
inherited.
</P>
<P>
More than half the population in Britain are affected by back
and neck pain, which is the commonest cause of time off work.

<HEADLINE> UK Companies Unveil Smart Refrigerator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Two British companies have
produced a smart refrigerator that writes shopping lists and even
tells when you are out of milk, The Daily Telegraph newspaper said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The freezer, developed by the computer company ICL and the
electronics manufacturer Electrolux, can remember what food is
inside to advise people when stores are running low.
</P>
<P>
It uses a barcode scanner to register food going in and out,
and can also be connected to the Internet to order and pay for
food.
</P>
<P>
David Cox, of ICL, predicted that in the future the
supermarkets may lease the smart refrigerators to their customers
so that they know their customers' eating habits.
</P>
<P>
Three prototypes have been built by the two companies, and the
next stage is to add voice recognition function to the smart
refrigerator, The Daily Telegraph said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Vaughan Pratt, Stanford
professor of computer science, has developed the world's
smallest web server which could be put into pocket and brought
to any where.
</P>
<P>
The matchbox-sized device contains all the hardware and
software needed to operate a web site. It is less than 1 3/4
inches high, 2 3/4 inches wide and 1/4 inch thick. It can
perform all the basic functions of a typical desktop computer
that occupies 3000 times the space.
</P>
<P>
"It is basically a powerful little computer," Pratt says. It
consists of an AMD 486-SX computer with a 66 megahertz central
processing unit, 16 megabytes of random access memory(RAM), and
16 megabytes of flash read-only memory(ROM). It is connected to
the Internet through a parallel port and runs a cut-down version
of linux. Because the machine is a web server, it does not need
a keyboard or a display. It can be operated from another
computer over the web connection.
</P>
<P>
"Put this computer into your shirt pocket, hook it to a
wireless modem, and you could carry it around with you," Pratt says.

<HEADLINE> Annan Asks for Attention to Older Persons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Thursday called on the world community to act to
meet the long-term needs of older persons, especially older
women and older persons in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Annan, in a speech at the opening of a video conference for the
International Year of Older Persons, said that "while this
International year can do a great deal in terms of raising
awareness, building coalition and mobilization both resources and
political will, we must also recognize the need to plan for the
long-term."
</P>
<P>
On the situation of older woman, the U.N. chief said, "Women
comprise the majority of older persons in all but a few countries.
They are more likely than men to be poorer in old ages, and more
likely to face discrimination."
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, their contributions as care-givers -- for example,
to grandchildren orphaned by AIDS -- are often overlooked and
unpaid, if paid at all," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
On the situation of developing countries, he said, "All
societies coping with the graying of their societies will have to
set aside substantial resources, and ensure that public health
and social services are up to the task."
</P>
<P>
He said that "developing nations, where the majority of older
persons live, will continue to need international help and
solidarity."
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said, "in something of a paradox, the new longevity
requires wiser investments in their earlier phases of life in
childhood, youth and mid-life. This will contribute to healthy
life-styles and life-long learning and all the other pillars of an
active old age."
</P>
<P>
The year 1999 was designated by the General Assembly as the
International Year of Older Persons in a bid to bring
international and national attention to the needs of older persons
in all societies.

<HEADLINE> Spain Promises to Deter Kurdish Activities: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit said Thursday that his Spanish counterpart Jose Maria Aznar
had assured him of deterring a meeting of the so-called "Kurdish
parliament in exile" in Spain.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said that he had a telephone conversations with Aznar
Wednesday night, in which the Spanish prime minister promised to
make efforts and continue to do so in the future to deter the
decision of the Basque parliament to allow the Kurdish body to
hold a meeting in the region.
</P>
<P>
However, Ecevit noted that "Aznar said that they can not
intervene with the internal affairs of the Basque region as it is
one of the autonomous regions in Spain."
</P>
<P>
The "Kurdish parliament in exile" is regarded by Ankara as a
wing of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), which has been
fighting since 1984 a guerrilla war for an independent Kurdish
state in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The conflicts between the PKK and the Turkish security forces
have claimed at least 37,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
Aznar stressed that they will make great efforts to prevent the
deterioration of the ties between Turkey and Spain, said Ecevit.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit pointed out that if the Basque parliament opens its
doors to the so-called "Kurdish parliament in exile," this will
be a "very dangerous behavior."
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the Spanish government will not give
opportunity to the deterioration of the Turkish-Spanish ties due
to the "Kurdish parliament in exile."

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Tourism Booming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Tourism in South Africa
has experienced a quantum leap in growth in the recent five years,
and the country has topped Africa's tourist destinations, South
African Tourism Minister Pallo Jordan said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
South Africa ranks 25th in the World Tourism Organization's
(WTO) listing of the world's 40 top holiday destinations, Jordan
said at a media briefing in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
WTO figures show that South Africa is currently among the seven
 countries in the world which has seen its tourism industry
growing at a rate of over 10 percent in the past three years,
Jordan was quoted by South African Press Association as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, crimes against tourists remain a big threat to tourism
and has the potential to cripple opportunities in the industry, he
said.
</P>
<P>
More than 5.9 million tourists visited South Africa last year,
an increase of 10 percent on the 1997 figure, Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
The industry contributed 53.2 billion Rand (8.9 billion U.S.
Dollars) toward total gross domestic product (GDP) in 1998, which
is 8.2 percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
Tourism has created 187,000 new jobs in the country in the past
three years, bringing the total of jobs in the industry to 7.4
million, which represents seven percent of the country's total
employment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan expressed concern for the high level of crime in South
Africa, saying the recent spate of bombings in Cape Town, one of
the favorite destinations for foreign visitors, had a very
negative effect on the country's image abroad.
</P>
<P>
To counter the problem, the Tourism Department has established
a tourism safety task group, which involves the police, to ensure
that tourists are safe in the country, Jordan said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The London International
Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) announced Thursday
it will launch its international bond futures contracts onto its
new electronic trading platform, LIFFE ConnectTM, on 10 May 1999.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Exchange announced that its UK stock index

</P>
<P>
LIFFE ConnetTM is a new generation electronic trading platform
which has been designed and developed in-house by the LIFFE at a
cost of 10.5 million pounds for equities and 25 million pounds for
futures.
</P>
<P>

ConnectTM, has increased by 37 percent since the transfer.
</P>
<P>
Since the move to ConnectTM on 30 November they have traded an
average daily volume of 18,361 contracts compared to an average
daily volume of 13,419 contracts, over the same time period in

<HEADLINE> Support in UK To Join Euro Soars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Support in Britain to join the
euro has surged to its highest-ever level, according to a new poll
by the Guardian newspaper and market researchers ICM.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that the number of those who say they would
vote "yes" to the euro in a referendum has jumped by seven points
in the last month to 36 percent of voters.
</P>
<P>
It is believed here that the poll result will fuel hopes from
euro supporters that the UK Government will seek to adopt the new
currency sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
However, a majority of UK voters remain euro-sceptic, with 52
percent still willing to vote against its adoption despite the
euphoria which has surrounded its introduction.
</P>
<P>
The UK's labor government is thought to be in favor of adopting
the currency, but has been forced to tread carefully amidst a
barrage of criticism from the UK media.

<HEADLINE> Impact of Euro on Africa Unlikely to Be Huge: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean business people were
told Thursday the newly introduced Euro currency is unlikely to
have a huge impact on Africa as the level of trade with the
European Monetary Union (EMU) is still low.
</P>
<P>
Economic adviser of the European Commission Jose Leandro told a
high level luncheon of Zimbabwe business people that the effect
would depend on the extend to which the Euro will increase or
reduce exchange rate volatility between the main international
currencies, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"This means that the effect on Africa will be small and will
take time to filter through," Leandro said.
</P>
<P>
The international impact of the Euro would be primarily felt in
 countries with close trading and economic links like the three
sub-groups of the French Franc area in Africa, countries of the
Mediterranean as well as those of central and eastern Europe,
Leandro said.
</P>
<P>
The rest of Africa was likely to see the effect of trade
creation in Europe resulting from positive macro- and
micro-economic factors of reduced interest rates and the
efficiency gains of using one monetary system.
</P>
<P>
"Our studies have shown that the trade creation factor is
higher than the trade diversion factor, so there is anticipated
rise in import demand," Leandro said.

<HEADLINE> WWF Warns of Continued Threats to Tiger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Marking the end of the Chinese
Year of the Tiger, the conservation organization WWF warned on
Thursday that despite sustained efforts over the past year, much
remains to be done to prevent the tiger from becoming extinct
early next century.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot let up for one moment if we are to ensure that
tigers will still exist in the wild by the next Chinese Year of
the Tiger in 2010," said Elizabeth Kemf, Species Conservation
Information Manager at the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).
</P>
<P>
In its latest study Wanted Alive: Tigers in the Wild published
here Thursday, the WWF said that while significant legislative
progress has been made over the past year, unless efforts continue
to eliminate the demand for tiger products, and to reinforce
anti-poaching measures, this magnificent feline will be stalked
into extinction.
</P>
<P>
"The tiger is threatened almost exclusively by human action,
and unless governments and other decision makers take the
necessary steps, the efforts of the conservation community can
only have a delaying effect on the decline of the tiger," said
Kemf, one of the authors of the WWF report.
</P>
<P>
Tiger numbers have declined by a dramatic 95 percent over the
past 100 years. Three of the eight subspecies of tiger, the bali,
Caspian and Javan tigers have become extinct. The South China
tiger risks the same fate as only 20 or 30 are known to remain in
the wild, down from an estimated 4,000 in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
The world tiger population is estimated to be between 5,000 and
7,200 now. Major threats to the tiger include illegal hunting for
the medicinal trade, loss of prey species, weak law enforcement,
poaching, habitat loss as well as a shrinking gene pool.
</P>
<P>
The WWF has called 1998 the Year for the Tiger. The
above-mentioned threats were addressed through a range of
different activities. These included establishing a Tiger
Emergency Fund, supporting the tiger Conservation Program in
India, and work in the Russian Far East.

ADDIS ABABA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Disaster Prevention
and Preparedness Commission (DPPC) of Ethiopia announced on
Thursday that it has come to an understanding with the European
Union (EU) to make a prompt local purchase of 94,000 tons of
cereals.
</P>
<P>
The DPPC said the purchase of cereals is part of the EU food
aid grants to the Emergency Food Security Reserve and for
repayment of loans issued to non-governmental organizations for
development and relief activities in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
It said predominant maize and sorghum with a small amount of
wheat are the types of cereals to be purchased with lot sizes
varying from 1,000 to 3, 000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The DPPC said the tender will officially be launched on March
5, 1999 by the Local Food Security Unity of the European
Commission.

ANKARA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit said here Thursday that he will raise several proposals
regarding the problems Iraq is facing.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit is expected to raise the proposals during the visit by
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz to Turkey on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said that he has some "constructive" proposals for the
latest developments in Iraq, but he did not give details of the
proposals.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Aziz said in Baghdad that he and Turkish
high-ranking officials will discuss the Incirlik Air Base in
Adana, southern Turkey, during his visit to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. use of the Incirlik Air Base in patrolling the no-fly
zone in northern Iraq has been a major dispute between Turkey and
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its allies set up no-fly zones in southern and
northern Iraq after the Gulf War in 1991 with a claimed aim to
protect the Kurds in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south
from alleged Baghdad's suppression.
</P>
<P>
After the four-day U.S.-British air strikes on Iraq last
December, the U.S. and Britain have launched waves of bombings
and air strikes on Iraqi targets. Many of the warplanes involved
took off from the Incirlik base.

<P>
LONDON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Punctuality on British trains
is getting even worse with most private trains often late, the
Rail Franchising Director John O'Brien said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to figures of the Central Rail Users' Consultative
Committee released by O'Brien, just one of the 25 private train
companies - the Isle of Wight Island Line - achieved top marks for
both punctuality and reliability in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Punctuality remains poor and these results are not good
enough," he said.
</P>
<P>
The committee added that despite continued deterioration in
performance, the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising (Opraf)
still made bonus payments of 14 million pounds (23 million U.S.
dollars) to train companies while penalties totalled only 8.3
million pounds (13.7 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Sir Alan Greengross, chairman of the London Regional
Passengers' Committee, said that Britain's experiment in
privatization of its train network had a long way to go before it
could be called a success.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Transport John Reid admitted that overall
performance figures were disappointing.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Visits Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Deputy Secretary of State
for African affairs Witney Schneidman arrived here Thursday to
start his two- day official visit in Angola.
</P>
<P>
A source from U.S. embassy in Luanda said Schneidman had come
with a letter from President Bill Clinton to his Angolan
counterpart Eduardo dos Santos, but the source did not reveal the
details of the letter.
</P>
<P>
Schneidman told the press at the airport that his visit is
aimed at strengthening bilateral relations with Angola. But
according to a press communique issued earlier by the U.S.
embassy, the visit by Schneidman, an economic expert, is to help
Angola develop its economy and promote trade relations between the
U.S. and Angola.
</P>
<P>
Angola is the second largest trade partner of the U.S. in the
sub- Saharan Africa. The two countries have had long-term
cooperative relations, particularly in oil tapping. The U.S.
companies have controled over 60 percent of oil exploration in
Angola.
</P>
<P>
However, local observers believe the deteriorating conflict
between the Angolan government and the opposition National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) will surely be one of
the major topics at Schneidman's meetings with local authorities.
</P>
<P>
Antonio dos Santos Franca, Angola's ambassador to the U.S.,
said earlier in Washington that his government is perturber and
worried about U.S. policy on Angola. He said U.S. has treated
UNITA Chairman Jonas Savimbi, a criminal of Angola's civil war, on
the equal footing with the legitimate government, which is
unacceptable to the Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
Under Schneidman's itinerary in Angola, he will held talks with
Defense Minister Kundi Paihama and leader of the breakaway group,
UNITA Renovation Committee, Eugenio Manuvakula, in addition to
ministers of petroleum, planning and foreign affairs.

petition in which they asked him to reaffirm the government still
recognize the rule of law in the country following the arrest of
two journalists by the military police and their subsequent
alleged torture.
</P>
<P>
The two journalists were arrested over a story of a failed coup
attempt and the government ignored three court orders to release
the reporters resulting in the petition.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting was cordial, fruitful and constructive and at this
historic meeting, it was considered to be common cause that the
executive arm of government upholds, protects and respects, as
before and always, the rule of law, court orders and the
independence of the judiciary," Dube said.
</P>
<P>
"The Law Society of Zimbabwe is, therefore, confident that the
apparent differences of opinion between the executive and the
judiciary, albeit on procedural issues, can and will be resolved
without delay," Dube said.

<HEADLINE> PNA Considering Put-off of Statehood Declaration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat said Thursday that the
Palestinians are considering put-off of statehood declaration.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came amid wide speculation that Arafat is likely to
put off statehood declaration in order not to be made a issue by
hard-line Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the May
elections, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has repeatedly said that he will declare an independent
state on May 4, the deadline by which Israel and the Palestinians
are supposed to have reached a permanent agreement according to
the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
But he has been under mounting pressure to postpone such a
declaration since Israel's parliament decided last month to hold
elections two weeks after the Oslo deadline.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the U.S. and the European Union have tried to convince
the Palestinian leader that a unilateral declaration on May 4 will
drive jittering Israeli voters to elect a hard-line party to power.
</P>
<P>
Reports have emerged recently that Arafat is considering to
delay the statehood announcement until December 31 if Washington
backs the new date.
</P>
<P>
A famous strategic think tank in Israel, the Tel Aviv
University's Jaffee Center for Strategic Study, submitted a report
to Netanyahu earlier this week, saying that Arafat might postpone
his statehood plan if Washington agrees to pressure Israel to move
forward the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu still used his opportunity of meeting with visiting
Belgian Deputy Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo Thursday to renew his
warning that a unilateral declaration will be total violations of
signed agreements between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
His government has threatened to annex parts of the West Bank
still under its control if the Palestinians unilaterally declare
the statehood on May 4.

<HEADLINE> EU Trade Growth Continues to Slow in 1998: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)'s
trade growth in 1998 saw a gradual slowdown despite a total
surplus of 88 billion U.S. dollars for January-October period,
EU's official statistical report published on Thursday shows.
</P>
<P>
The 11-nation euro zone had a trade surplus with the rest of
the world of 8.2 billion U.S. dollars in October. This gave euro
zone a total surplus of 88 billion U.S. dollars for
January-October, down 0.68 billion U.S. dollars compared with the
same period in 1997, said the Eurostat, the EU statistical office.
</P>
<P>
The euro-zone's extra-trade with the outside world includes
trade with four member states not adopting the euro, namely the
Britain, Sweden, Denmark and Greece. Currently, EU's intra-trade
accounts for about 75 percent of its total trade volume.
</P>
<P>
In October 1998, 15 EU member countries had a trade surplus of
1.82 billion U.S. dollars with the rest of the world. However,
there was a trade surplus of only 18.4 billion U.S. dollars in the
first 10 months compared to 44 billion U.S. dollars in
January-October of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Though extra- and intra-trade growth last October showed weak
or falling in both the 11-country euro zone and all the 15-member
EU region, EU as a whole had strong trade growth with the United
States and China in the first 10 months last year.
</P>
<P>
EU trade with the United States was well up in the first 10
months with 14 percent increase for exports and 11 percent gain
for imports over the same period a year earlier, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Eurostat also pointed out that effects of the situation in
Asian financial markets can be seen in a fall in exports to Japan
with 14 percent decrease, but trade growth with China remains
strong with 10 percent increase for exports and 13 percent
increase for imports. At the same time, trade with the main
Eastern European partners, namely Poland, Czech Republic and
Hungary, is also growing strongly.
</P>
<P>
In the period of January-October 1998, Germany still enjoyed
the largest surplus with 66.3 billion U.S. dollars, while
Britain's deficit rose strongly to -39.3 billion U.S. dollars. And
Ireland continued to show the strongest growth, and now has the
third highest surplus of 19.2 billion U.S. dollars in
January-October period last year, the Eurostat said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese President to Visit Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile
Lahoud is to pay a two-day official visit to Syria starting
Friday, his first tour abroad since assuming power last November.
</P>
<P>
The Voice of People radio quoted Presidential Palace sources
as saying the president will hold talks with his Syrian
counterpart Hafez Assad and other senior officials on bilateral
ties and the peace process in the region.
</P>
<P>
Their talks will also focus on the situation in south Lebanon
where Israeli occupation forces and Lebanese guerrillas are locked
in a war of attrition on daily basis.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's resistance movement, spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to
oust Israelis and its allied South Lebanon Army out of the region.
</P>
<P>
The two president are expected to reaffirm the "entwinement of
Lebanese and Syrian tracks" in the peace talks with Israel, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupies Syria's Golan Heights it captured in the 1967
Middle East War. Peace negotiations between the two sides was
stalled in 1996 when Israel's general elections brought the
right-wing Likud party to power.
</P>
<P>
Syria wants the return of the strategic plateau, as promised in
a tacit agreement with Israel's previous Labor government. The new
Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, however, refused to be
tied to the Labor stance and cede an inch of the land.
</P>
<P>
On the south Lebanon issue, the Jewish state offered last April
to withdraw from the occupied border strip "provided security
arrangements can be reached" with the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
The offer was rejected by Lebanon and its ally Syria, which
asked Israel to exit without any preconditions as demanded by
U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Israel accused Syria of holding south Lebanon as a bargaining
chip to seek a full Israeli withdrawal which will also include
the Golan. Syria has 35,000 troops stationed in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud, a former army commander, was elected Lebanon's 11th
president apparently enjoying both the approval of Assad and
popular support of the Lebanese people.

<HEADLINE> 9 Killed, 26 Injured in Accidents in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Nine people were killed and 26
others injured on Thursday in two separate traffic accidents in
southern Egypt, the Middle East News Agency here reported.
</P>
<P>
In the west area of Asyut Governorate, about 300 kilometers
south of Cairo, five vehicles ran into each other due to a dense
fog, killing eight people and wounding 12, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
In another accident, two tourist buses collided on the Red Sea
coastal road, killing a German tourist and injuring 14 others, a
statement issued by the Egyptian Interior Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The accident took place when one tourist bus driving from Qena,
450 kilometers south of the capital, to Hurghada, 400 southeast of
Cairo, overtook another car but suddenly swerved to the opposite
lane and collided with the other tourist bus.
</P>
<P>
The injured, six of them in serious condition, have been taken
to hospitals for treatment, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Traffic accidents are common in Egypt as vehicles are often
driven at high speed and drivers impatient. In the past three
weeks, 42 people were killed and 61 others wounded in road
accidents.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Passes New Land Acts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's National
Assembly Thursday endorsed the much-awaited Land Bill and the
Village Land Bill, 1999 with the Minister for Lands and Human
Settlement Development Gideon Cheyo calling for an end to land
disputes.
</P>
<P>
Cheyo challenged villages embroiled in the disputes to sit down
and resolve their conflicts before land officers are notified to
mark land borders.
</P>
<P>
He told parliament in the central city of Dodoma that pamphlets
and periodicals will be prepared and distributed in villages to
enlighten people on land ownership rights, reports reaching here
said.
</P>
<P>
Cheyo said it is untrue that the government has been pressured
by foreign forces to table the bills, insisting that it was
locally conceived.
</P>
<P>
Tabling the bills last Thursday, the minister said his ministry
has made sure that all sections of the act which discriminates
women from men in land acquisition were scrapped.
</P>
<P>
"The rights of women in acquiring, owning and selling land have
been harmonized to equal those of their male counterparts," he
said, adding that the emphasis is to do away with gender
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
Under the bills, investors will have no right on land
ownership, instead they will get land as tenants under special
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
Investors will be given land for specific periods depending on
the nature of business they undertake, Cheyo said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said land disputes should be dealt with promptly
before they cause social disharmonization in the society.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Deputy Minister Mudhihiri Mohamed Mudhihiri promised
that land offices in the regions will be provided with essential
equipment and facilities to improve working efficiency.
</P>
<P>
He said functionaries will also attend various courses intended
to sharpen their skills on handling land issues more
intelligently.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the bills were passed, a group of women
members of parliament chanted inside and outside the house chamber
to welcome the act for giving women equal land ownership rights.

<HEADLINE> Skirmishes Occurs on Ethio-Eritrean Fronts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia said Thursday
evening that "there are currently only limited skirmishes
occurring" on both Badme- Sheraro and Tsorona fronts when the
renewed fighting entered the sixth day.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, the Office of Ethiopian Government
Spokesperson Selome Taddesse said the Ethiopian forces "have not
only successfully defended their sovereign territory through their
counter- offensive engagements, but they have caused the Eritrean
forces significant military losses".
</P>
<P>
"The Ethiopian army has captured key military positions that
will be crucial in the next stage of regaining Ethiopia's occupied
territory," the office said.
</P>
<P>
It said that "although the Eritrean forces tried repeatedly to
recapture these positions, the Ethiopian defense forces
successfully repelled them until they were forced to admit their
defeat."
</P>
<P>
"The determination of the Ethiopia defense Forces has ensured
that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ethiopia is
being restored," the Office said, adding that "Ethiopia does not
want anything more beyond reclaiming its invaded land and it will
not accept anything less."
</P>
<P>
The nine-month border conflict erupted into heavy fighting on
February 6 after an eight-month lull. The renewed fighting firstly
started on Badme- Sheraro front, later spreading to the Tsorona
front.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations
Security Council this week called on both Ethiopia and Eritrea to
immediately stop their renewed border fighting.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Bank Executive Sees Asia Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Southeast Asian economies are
likely to be the first to show signs of recovery, said a Dutch
bank executive said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Presenting his investment outlook to reporters in Geneva, Jacob
van Duijn, head of investment operations for Dutch bank Robeco,
said that the Asian economies would be first out of difficulties
as they were first to run into trouble.
</P>
<P>
Van Duijn said Robeco, which puts the value of assets under its
management at 80 billion euros was now putting more money into
equity markets such as Hong Kong and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Van Duijn predicted that the global economy
would slow down and would not bottom out until the second half of
the next year.
</P>
<P>
He said his views were based on a cyclical outlook. "Every
seven to 11 years there is a recession," he said, noting the last
world recession was in 1991-92.
</P>
<P>
"We're really headed for a global economic slowdown," he said.
"If everything stays normal, then a cyclical low could be reached
in the second half of the year 2000."
</P>
<P>
Last year's economic turmoil in southeast Asia had prompted
companies there to restructure and many had also gained a
competitive advantage for export through the currency devaluations
which were part of the upheaval, Van Duijn said.
</P>
<P>
Looking further ahead, Van Duijn said a combination of
demographic factors and economic cycles meant the West was likely
to reach full employment around 2005.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Launches Project for Int'l Elders Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- the United Nations Center for
Human Settlements (UNCHS) Thursday launched a project "Living
conditions of older persons in urban communities" here as a
contribution to the International Year of Older Person 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Nairobi-based UNCHS, also known as Habitat, said in a press
release that the project aims at facilitating field research in a
number of cities in both developed and developing countries and
attaching importance to the urban and housing needs of older
persons.
</P>
<P>
Klaus Toepfer, Acting Executive Director of Habitat, said that
older persons could contribute greatly to the development of
cultural, economic and social activities. Local governments and
municipal authorities should have the greatest responsibility to
develop such innovative mechanisms and opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The release noted that every month, the world's elderly
population increases by 1.2 million. By 2020, 1.4 billion persons
will be over 60 years, an increase of 240 percent since 1980, with
the fastest growth in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
By 2025, worldwide average life expectancy will reach 73 years,
a 50 percent improvement on the 1955 average of only 48 years. One
in five person will be 60 years or above by 2050, the release
added.
</P>
<P>
Longevity is an indicator of a nation's progress and
development, the release said, adding that ageing population has
posed particular demands on public services, such as housing,
transportation and health facilities.
</P>
<P>
It urged urban planners, housing units, public and private
sectors to suit the needs of the elderly and pay close attention
to the valuable contributions of older persons in the social and
economic development of their communities.

<HEADLINE> Annan Favors Peaceful Settlement to African, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said on Thursday that he favors a diplomatic and
political solution to conflicts in Africa and the Serbian province
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the remarks to reporters shortly after he briefed
the Security Council on the latest development in Sierra Leone,
Congo(K), Congo, the Central African Republic, Angola and the
Yugoslav province of Kosovo, where conflicts are raging on.
</P>
<P>
"We did go into the status of these crisis, and we also
discussed the tendencies today in Africa by governments tending
to be relying on military means to solve problems, rather than
political means," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are also concerned about the military adventurism by
governments to cross borders to send troops to fight in one
conflict and the other," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Council is worried about the implications of this
development for the concept of a nation-station the African
continent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said that the United Nations can play a major
role in the maintenance of peace and security only "when the
parties involved want to make peace, want to settle their
differences."
</P>
<P>
"The inspiration for long-term and viable peace has to spring
from the leader and the people," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the conflict in Congo (K), he said that it is possible that
the United Nations will consider sending peacekeepers into the
African country to "monitor and help the implementation of the
peace agreements."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is supporting regional initiatives to
restore peace in these areas, particularly the efforts by West
African countries to bring peace to Sierra Leone, where
democratically-elected government, headed by President Ahmed
Kabah, is fighting with rebels after they were flushed out of the
capital Freetown by West African peacekeepers, known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
On the conflicts in Kosovo, Annan said that he is "cautiously
optimistic" about the on-going peace talks in France, sponsored
by the six-nation Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
"As long as they are talking, I think we are making progress,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Romanians to Be Better Shielded Against Deceitful </HEADLINE>

BUCHAREST, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian government
adopted Thursday a bill of advertising aiming at a better
protection of consumers, producers, traders and services operators
against deceitful advertising and its negative impact.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, advertising should be decent and correct. The
bill bans cheating or subliminal advertising, that prejudices
respect for human dignity and public moral, takes advantage of
human superstitions, credulity or fear, and encourages the sale of
goods and services infringing the existing legislation.
</P>
<P>
It also forbids tobacco publicity within TV or radio broadcast,
or in the written press, on the first and last cover of the
papers. Tobacco and alcohol advertising is also banned if
addressing minors or present minors consuming them.
</P>
<P>
Alcoholic drinks and tobacco presented as having therapeutic,
stimulating or sedative effects, and cigarettes lacking a
Romanian-language warning on their harmful consequences, are also
forbidden under the bill.
</P>
<P>
Law infringement attracts material and civil penalty.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Increase Strategic Petroleum Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government
announced on Thursday a plan to add 28 million barrels of oil to
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve the nation would tap in times of
oil crisis.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the government will add up to 100,000 barrels
daily to the emergency petroleum reserve by accepting oil instead
of cash from companies paying royalties for drilling on public
lands in the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said the
move has a dual purpose: to improve the nation's energy security
and refill the reserve with oil now selling at historic lows.
</P>
<P>
"We are making this step for energy security, for good energy
policy," he said. "The American taxpayer wins because oil prices
are low and we store for a rainy day."
</P>
<P>
U.S. oil producers who have been battered by depressed oil
prices have been clamoring for help from the government, with
reserve replenishment one of the items on their agenda.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, the government has sold 28 million barrels from the
reserve as a revenue-producing measure to offset other federal
spending. That oil was sold for an average 19.50 U.S. dollars a
barrel and can be replenished now at a cost of less than 12
dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
The reserve now holds 563 million barrels of oil, more than 119
million barrels below capacity.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Preparing for Water Management Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands is preparing
for good water management to protect the country against the
danger of flooding due to the combined hazard of rising sea levels
and falling land levels, Dutch Government Information Council said
in the Hague Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Dutch State Secretary for Transport, Public Works and Water
Management Monique de Vries presented Wednesday a policy document
on urban water systems, rivers, coastal waters and the sea. The
state secretary also announced an action program in which
priorities are set for Dutch assistance in water management
projects in other countries.
</P>
<P>
A study is to be carried out into the water management
structure needed in the Netherlands for the 21st century.
According to the study findings, an independent committee will
advise the government on what improvements need to be made, 115
million guilders (59.3 million U.S. dollars) have already been set
aside for cleaning up the beds of water systems, and a further 700
million guilders (360 million dollars) have been reserved for
large-scale wetland projects, including the Rhine-Maas delta and
the Ijsselmeer lake.
</P>
<P>
The council also said the Netherlands is to make extra efforts
to limit flooding and the ensuing damage in the future. Pumping
stations at four strategically important points in the country's
hydromechanical system are to be upgraded.

<HEADLINE> European Major Stock Markets Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON February 11 (Xinhua) - A Strong performance on Wall
Street helped boost shares in European markets Thursday. However,
concerns about the outlook for the euro capped gains.
</P>
<P>
In London, the FTSE 100 closed 118.3 points ahead at 5888.5,
with some 34.5 points accounted for by British Telecom (BT) alone.
</P>
<P>
The telecoms giant added 101p or 11 percent to close at 1009p
as investors were cheered by robust revenue growth, the result of
big turnover gains in mobile, Internet and overseas startup
operations.
</P>
<P>
BT said pre-tax profits in the three months to December 31,
1998, fell to 858 million pounds from 1.019 billion in the same
period last year, but they easily topped forecasts of 698 to 792
million pounds.
</P>
<P>
However, shares are still well short of levels held last week
before succumbing to a string of six consecutive losses. The FTSE
100 finished at 6013 on 2 February.
</P>
<P>
German shares moved further ahead as Wall Street traded in
positive territory, although investors remained wary following
recent volatility.
</P>
<P>
The Xetra Dax closed 55.25 points higher at 4869.29. Dealers
said there was a notable departure of foreign investors in recent
sessions as they grew cautious about the euro's performance on
foreign exchange markets.
</P>
<P>
Paris shares moved ahead, also boosted by positive signals from
New York and a raft of positive earnings news. The Cac 40 finished
70.41 points higher at 4,072.34.

<HEADLINE> Swine Fever Not Found in Ghana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Ghana has not yet recorded any
case of the African swine fever which is sweeping across the
continent, Samuel Achaw Ofosu, deputy director of Veterinary
Services, said in Accra Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Samples taken from about 20 percent of the animals reared
along our borders for laboratory analysis show that our animals
have not had the deadly disease," he was quoted by Ghana News
Agency as saying, adding, "We still bleed some animals every now
and then for analysis."
</P>
<P>
Ofosu, however, warned that "since the disease is still in our
neighboring countries, the situation is grave and the whole
sub-region is not free."
</P>
<P>
He advised farmers to look out for symptoms such as red patches
on the skin, high temperature, dragging and paralysis of hind legs
and loss of appetite and report immediately to the nearest
veterinary station or offices of the Ministry of Food and
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The viral disease, which affects only pigs, and has no known
treatment nor vaccine, has reportedly killed about 80 percent of
pigs reared in Lagos, Nigeria, in the past six months. A
committee estimated the financial loss to the farmers at more than
723 million Naira (about 8.4 million Dollars). Similar losses
have been reported across the country, resulting in acute shortage
of pork.
</P>
<P>
Pig farmers in Lagos, Nigeria's economic hub, are threatening
undisclosed action unless government came to their rescue.
</P>
<P>
Ofosu warned that even though the disease cannot be passed on
to human beings, the carcass of an infected animal is unwholesome
and can cause other conditions like food poisoning, and therefore,
it must not be eaten.
</P>
<P>
He said Ghana has placed a ban on the importation of pigs, pork
and pig products from Cote d' Ivoire and Togo, where the disease
has been reported. Such products are, however, not imported from
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The ban is still in force, he said, adding that anybody who
wants to import pigs and pig products must acquire a permit from
the Service.
</P>
<P>
According to Ofosu, Ghana took immediate steps to prevent the
disease from entering its borders when an outbreak was reported in
Cote d' Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
The disease was first reported in Cameroun in 1997 where it
became endemic. It later got to Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
Later Benin recorded an outbreak which spread to Togo and
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Following this precarious situation, the Food and Agriculture
Organization sent a consultant from Rome in late 1997 to
investigate the situation and then set up an emergency Technical
Cooperation Program involving 386,000 Dollars for nine countries
in west Africa, including Ghana.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, a two-day workshop was organized last
November for veterinary personnel from all over the country on how
to diagnose the disease and how to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
Pork provides a substantial amount of Ghana's animal protein
requirement.

<HEADLINE> Private Kindergartens, Schools Expand in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Private kindergarten and
schools are rapidly expanding in Romania, with 72 private
kindergartens and 113 private schools opened so far, the Rompres
news agency Thursday quoted sources from the Ministry of National
Education as saying.
</P>
<P>
Under estimates, their number will grow in the coming period,
as they are in high demand by firms and individuals. The
Evaluation Commission for pre-academic education established
conditions and set taxes for each educational unit.
</P>
<P>
It is worthy of note that special methods for teaching foreign
languages were introduced in private schools. These units take
into account the children's options for certain disciplines as
well as their gifts. Syllabuses are elaborated which pay attention
to these elements. Teachers are chosen on the basis of tests.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the Ministry of National Education,
notable results have been scored so far in private schools.

<P>
NAIROBI, February 11 (XInhua) -- A 27-year-old Ghanaian,
Osumanu Dawuda, who stowed away in Nigeria on board M/V RORO Delma
to France was convicted Thursday and fined by a circuit tribunal
in Accra, the Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
He will go to jail for one month if he fails to pay the fine of
100,000 Cedis (about 43 U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Dawuda was convicted on his own plea of guilty.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor, Inspector Alice Takyiwaa said Dawuda,
unemployed, went to Nigeria in 1998 in search of a job in the
capital Lagos.
</P>
<P>
In November 1998 the accused sneaked into the ship and hid
himself. On the high sea, he ran out of food and water and
therefore went to the kitchen to help himself.
</P>
<P>
Dawuda was arrested by the captain of the vessel and handed
over to the immigration authorities when the ship docked in
Ghana.

<HEADLINE> Women Body in Ghana Raps Violence Against Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 11 (XInhua) -- The National Council on Women
and Development (NCWD) has condemned the increasing spate of
violence against women in northern Ghana.
</P>
<P>
The council has, therefore, called on the government to revoke
customs, traditions and religious practices which help perpetuate
violence in line with the International Declaration on the
Elimination of Violence Against Women, the Ghana News Agency (GNA)
 reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in Tamale, northern Ghana,
Wednesday, Fati Paul, regional coordinator of the NCWD, asked the
law enforcement agencies to conduct thorough investigations into
such incidents.
</P>
<P>
The conference was in reaction to the latest incident involving
the alleged beating to death of a 28-year-old pregnant woman, Fati
Abdallah, by her husband, Abdul Rahman Ziblim, 41, in Tamale.
</P>
<P>
Mariama Sumani, chairperson of the regional planning committee
of the NCWD, said a number of long-term strategies had been
adopted to eliminate violence against women.
</P>
<P>
These include public education to raise the status of women to
gain recognition of their full human rights and lobbying of
parliament to reform laws that allow such violence.
</P>
<P>
Hajia Alima Mahama, a member of the committee, expressed
concern about the growing incidence of lynching of old women on
suspicion that they are witches, rape, child defilement, assault
and female genital mutilation in the region.

<HEADLINE> Israel Raps EU for Opposing Jewish Settlements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior Israeli official
on Thursday criticized European Union (EU) for backing a U.N.
resolution calling Jewish settlement activities in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip a violation of the Geneva Convention.
</P>
<P>
David Bar-Illan, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
communication adviser, said that Israel was very upset with the
EU member states' vote for the resolution.
</P>
<P>
He said that the EU members should think about the adverse
effect of the resolution on the peace process before they voted.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution 115-2 Tuesday
night, calling for a meeting of the signatories to the 1949 Fourth
Geneva Convention to be held this summer to consider measures to
enforce the convention "in the occupied Palestinian territory,
including Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, who arrived in Israel
Wednesday on his first official visit, bore the brunt of Israel's
displeasure.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Netanyahu moved his mid-morning meeting with
Fischer to the evening, citing that he had to cope with a brewing
domestic crisis with the country's powerful ultra-Orthodox
minority.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon canceled his talks
with Fischer, saying doctors ordered him to rest at home because
of knee injury he sustained in a car accident early this week.
</P>
<P>
But Bar-Illan insisted that there was no link between Israel's
displeasure with the EU and the sudden schedule changes.
</P>
<P>
"Fischer's visit is very welcome. Fischer has made some
statements favorable (to Israel)," Bar-Illan said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Jerusalem Post reported Thursday that Israeli
Foreign Ministry was in private blaming Germany, which is holding
the rotating six-month EU presidency, for not doing more to thwart
the U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
Fischer will go on to Gaza for talks with Palestinian National
Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat after visit to Israel.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Iraq Sign Trade Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Iraq have signed an
agreement to export 86 million U.S. dollars worth of food to Iraq,
Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammad Mahdi Saleh said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Saleh made the remarks during his visit to the Egyptian
Governorate of Daqahliya in the Nile Delta, 90 kilometers north of
Cairo. But he did not say when the agreement was signed.
</P>
<P>
The volume of trade exchange between the two countries climbed
to 300 million dollars in 1997 from 20 millions dollars in earlier
years, the Iraqi official was quoted by Egypt's Middle East News
Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is under economic sanctions, barring it from trading with
other countries, which were imposed in 1990 by the United Nations
Security Council after its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
But the 1996 oil-for-food agreement reached between the U.N.
and Iraq allows it to sell a limited amount of oil to buy food and
medicine for its people.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is one of the major exporters to Iraq. Its exports of
food to the country are secured under the oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister underlined that the high mortality rate of
the Iraqi children and elderly each month is part of the
repercussions of the U.N. economic embargo.
</P>
<P>
Official figures of Iraq have showed that hundreds of children
and elderly in the country die every month due to shortage of food
and medicine.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi official said that exports of Arab countries to Iraq
have accounted for 50 percent of his country's imports.
</P>
<P>
Inter-arab trade exchange stands at a mere 10 percent of the
total volume of Arab foreign trade, Saleh stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister, accompanied by Daqahliya Governor Fakhr
al-Din Khaled, paid a visit to a number of production and
industrial facilities in the governorate.

BUCHAREST, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The number of VISA card

the number in circulation exceeding 92,000 at the end of January

The bank with the best results in using the new payment system
in Romania is Bank Post which has issued about 65,000 VISA cards so
far. The new payment system in Romania depends for extension on
the number of automatic machines for cash and there were about
25,000 of them at the end of January 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on
Thursday hosted an "informal visit" with German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
"This is an informal visit," he told reporters, explaining that
in the diplomatic language of Washington it fell below the
no-frills "working visit" stature -- which avoids any hint of
pomp.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said that during the two-hour get-together, which
included lunch, Clinton and his guest were "to spend some time on
the upcoming NATO summit which we will host in April and the G-8
meeting which the Germans will host in June."
</P>
<P>
Washington will be the site of a 50th anniversary celebration
of the NATO alliance, while Cologne will host the annual meeting
of the seven major industrial nations and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder has said he want the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization to reconsider its long-standing "first strike"
doctrine on nuclear weapons, which he views as an unnecessary
relic of the Cold War, but his position was greeted with rejection
from Washington.
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said the meeting between Clinton and
Schroeder was designed in part oto develop a working relationship
between them.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl once developed
a relationship by going out to restaurants together and feasting,
and the president "wants a relationship with Schroeder as well,"
said one of the administration officials in describing the purpose
of the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Economy to Perform Well in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- This year will be the turning
point for Zambia's economy because basic indicators have suggested
that the economy will perform well, Jacob Mwanza, governor of the
country's central bank, said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He made the prediction at a luncheon held for media heads and
senior management of the central bank.
</P>
<P>
He said last year's economic decline will be reversed this year
because more investment and more donor support is coming to the
country.
</P>
<P>
Last year the economy did not do well due to various factors
like the poor performance of the mines, poor price of copper and
poor performance of the agricultural sector, said the governor.
</P>
<P>
He also blamed the lack of balance of payment support and
business confidence as well as the delayed sale of copper mines of
the Zambia Consolidate Copper Mines (ZCCM), for the poor economic
performance in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"We have this year set ourselves goals like bringing inflation
to 15 percent which we hope we will accomplish because the basic
indicators have suggested that the economy will perform well," he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the governor, Zambia has reached an agreement in
the balance of payment support which has started to flow while the
 privatization of ZCCM has reached an irreversible stage.
</P>
<P>
"The rains this season have been good and favorable because it
is our wish not to import more grain to feed the population," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The fact that this year's budget report allocates 37 percent of
the government spending to capital expenditure is a good sign for
growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
Most important areas like infrastructure construction will be
tackled which will see roads rehabilitated, education and energy
receiving priority, he said.
</P>
<P>
"All these plus other investment opportunities which stalled
over a period of the time due to slow race in the privatization of
the mines make us feel that our targets are achievable," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have in the past two weeks infused in the economy 18.8
million U.S. Dollars to stabilize the economy. Last Tuesday we
put in 9.3 million Dollars and this week we put in 9.5 million
Dollars," Mwanza said.

who was charged with misuse of public property was declared

1987 in the city of Dalian at a time when there were no
regulations on registering private businesses in China and he had
to register the plant in the name of a collectively owned factory.
</P>
<P>
But, in 1995, when he established a privately owned company and
transferred the old factory's property and debts to the new one,
the local procurators decided to prosecute him.
</P>
<P>
According to their accusation, Zhang was guilty of embezzlement
of public property and, in 1998, he was sentenced to 3 year in
prison, with a 5-year reprieve and he appealed the sentence at the
Dalian Intermediate People's Court.
</P>
<P>
That lead to a year-long debate, with some people saying that
Zhang had eaten up public property because his old plant was
registered under a collectively-owned factory, while others said
that Zhang was innocent because he built the plant with his own
investment and paid all his own debts.
</P>
<P>
After a lengthy investigation, the court decided that Zhang's
company was a privately owned one in every sense and that the
first verdict against Zhang needed to be recalled.
</P>
<P>
This mistake arose out of a lack of laws and regulations
protecting private entrepreneurs' rights in 1995, Zhang's counsel
said, explaining that, before 1988, when China passed its
Provisional Regulation on Private Enterprises, the growing number
of private companies and factories had to put themselves under
government departments or state-owned enterprises to receive legal
protection.
</P>
<P>
But, as more and more bosses realized in the 1990s that they
actually own the companies and factories, they began to ask for
change of ownership.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the Chinese government decided to re-define ownership
of thousands of factories, opening a new chapter in the history of
private enterprises. But this proved to be not such an easy job,
as Wang Shuxiang, the chief justice who handled Zhang's case
explains, because the line between state enterprise and private
company was often blurred due to a lack of evidence and the
ambiguity of the regulations.
</P>
<P>
In northern China, where Dalian is located and where state
enterprises are plentiful, a private businessperson could find it
really hard to win a lawsuit, when compared to southern coastal
provinces, where private industry is commonplace, said Liu
Zhongquan, a professor at Dalian Science and Engineering
University.
</P>
<P>
"Zhang's victory is the victory of the socialist market, which
is gradually maturing, and it indicates a more important role of
private entrepreneurs in rejuvenating the nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Chinese Communist Party has proposed Constitutional
amendments that could place the private sector in a much higher
position, but, as for now, Zhang said, "I believe the law is just.
Private enterprises will get a more fair development environment
as the legal system is improved."

<HEADLINE> Cholera Breaks out in Northern Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 12 (Xinhua) -- There are reports of serious
cholera breaking out in the famine-stricken border region of Gedo,
northern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest reports from the town of Bardera in
Gedo region, 14 people, mainly women and children, died of cholera
on Thursday alone, while 82 others were also hospitalized after
falling for the disease.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Jama Ber, the governor of the region, said through the
VHF radio in the regional capital, Garbahaffey Town, that the
cholera disease is spreading in the community very fast, affecting
over 100 people per day. He characterized the situation as
desperate and alarming.
</P>
<P>
Local health authorities said severe diarrhea and dysentery are
also accompanying the cholera.  Ber said there's no single aid
agency fighting against the spread of the disease in the region
following what is called the temporary evacuation of the
international staff from the area in protest against the killing
of a Kenyan aid worker serving the Italian aid agency, Terra
Nuoya, in the region two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The local authorities also attributed the fast spread of the
disease to the water scarcity in the area especially in the remote
villages and the countryside. Reports said the situation has been
aggravated by the local movement of large number of families
displaced by famine and water shortage.
</P>
<P>
Ber said the current drought is the worst since 1974 when main
devastating Dabadher drought claimed the lives of thousands of
people
</P>
<P>
The authorities are complaining about the arrival of large
number of people coming from the regions of Bay, Bakol, Middle
Jubba and northeastern Kenya.  In Bulo Hawo Town of Gedo region
alone, over 500 refugees have crossed from the Kenyan border in
the past five days, said the district commissioner Haji Yussuf
Musa Abdi.
</P>
<P>
More than 8,000 families are now believed to be on the move in
search of food and water in Gedo region alone, while more than
4,000 other families are moving around in Bay region following the
prolonged drought and civil war that ravaged those regions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, over 700,000 people are believed to be suffering
from serious food shortage in southern Somalia following
insufficient rainfalls in the region in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The nomadic societies are equally suffering from the drought
after ban was imposed on Somalia's livestock exports to the Gulf
countries last year.
</P>
<P>
Over 80 percent of Somalia's population depend on the
livestock, especially the camels and goats, as the country's
largest exported item to the Arab countries.

northern zone.
</P>
<P>
He said there was no damage to U.S. aircraft and damage to the
Iraqi site was being assessed.
</P>
<P>
It was the third consecutive day that U.S. warplanes bombed
Iraqi air defense sites.

<HEADLINE> ICRC Continues Humanitarian Operations in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of
the Red Cross (ICRC) has recently carried out a seeds program in
Somalia aiming at assisting 15,000 families of small-scale
farmers affected by flooding, Michel Dufour, head of Somalia
delegation in Nairobi, said in a release available here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Dufour said the seeds had already been handed out to farmers in
Marere, Jilib, Jamame, Buale, Lower and Middle Shabelle regions in
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Concerned by reports that the humanitarian situation for the
most vulnerable Somalia has deteriorated, Dufour stressed that
the ICRC is constantly monitoring the humanitarian situation
there.
</P>
<P>
According to the release, the ICRC has also sent non-food items
such as tarpaulins, blankets and kangas to 1,450 families in
Jilib, Lower and Middle Shabelle regions in southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC is now distributing shelter materials, kangas and
cloths to 500 displaced families in South Mogadishu whose huts
were destroyed in fire.
</P>
<P>
Having reduced its activities last April following a security
incident, the ICRC resumed its field activities last December,
and provided medicines and surgical kits for the war-wounded who
were transferred to the Somalia Red Crescent health centers in
Jamame, Buale, Mugambo,Jilib or to other private hospitals in the
capital Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Dufour said security is an essential aspect of any ICRC action
and the ICRC did not believe that the general security situation
in Somalia improved during 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, the ICRC head noted that in 1999 the ICRC would
continue to operate in Somalia as it does in other context, but
with a constant and close attention to the security situation.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Senate's secret deliberations in President Bill
Clinton's impeachment trial wound toward a finish on Thursday, as
a fourth Republican announced plans to reject both articles,
pushing conviction supporters within a single vote of failing to
win even a simple majority against the president when the Senate
casts its votes on Friday.
</P>
<P>
-- First Lady Hillary Clinton has been the object of
speculation regarding a bid for the U.S. Senate, and some
Democrats say she will "seriously consider" running for a seat in
New York once President Clinton's impeachment trial ends.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Defying a Federal judge's order to end their protest and
return to work, more pilots called in sick at American Airlines on
Thursday, forcing the carrier to cancel more than half of its
flights and insuring that its operations would be crippled during
the Presidents' Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
-- The Clinton Administration is being pressed by NATO allies
to decide by the middle of next week whether American troops will
be sent to Kosovo as part of a peacekeeping force. NATO's
operational plan for Kosovo is expected to be approved by midweek,
and the precise composition of the force would be determined soon
after that.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- The NASDAK composite index soared 96.06 points, or 4.16
percent to 2405.55, its biggest point move ever and its ninth best
in percentage terms. Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan helped
spark the rally with positive comments on banking reform and
praise for the economy's strength.
</P>
<P>
-- Major U.S. steelmakers are in the final stages of preparing
a second round of unfair trade complaints against several
countries and could file them as early as next week, according to
people familiar with the plans.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Inventories Hold Steady in December as Sales Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. inventories at
businesses have remained unchanged in December while sales
increase, the Commerce Department said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
That means backlogs of unsold goods were relatively lean
heading into 1999. Too big a buildup can cause production cutbacks
as businesses work to sell surplus goods.
</P>
<P>
Inventories held at a seasonally adjusted 1.09 trillion U.S.
dollars in December, the first month with no increase since last
July.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, sales rose 1 percent, the biggest jump since
September 1997.
</P>
<P>
As a result, there were enough goods on shelves and backlots in
December to meet demand for just 1.37 months at the current sales
pace -- a low hit only twice before since 1980.
</P>
<P>
At retailers, inventories rose 0.7 percent and sales rose 1
percent, and at wholesalers, inventories rose 0.5 percent and
sales rose 1.2 percent. Manufacturers' inventories dropped 0.9
percent, in line with an identical 0.9 percent rise in sales.

<P>
GENEVA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The International Football
Association Board (IFAB) Annual General Meeting will try to find
ways to expose attempts to deceive the referee when it meets near
Cardiff of the United Kingdom on February 20.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the IFAB, composed of the Federation
Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) and the four British
national associations, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland, will focus on a number of proposed amendments and
additions to the Laws of the Game.
</P>
<P>
These initiatives reflect FIFA's resolve to keep the field of
play free of advertising and to crack down on cheating, FIFA said
in a press release on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed modifications, any simulating action
anywhere on the field would be deemed unsporting behavior and
would be punished by a yellow card.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the participants will also discuss a possible
experiment with two referees and the feasibility of introducing
goal-line technology.
</P>
<P>
Other items for discussion include the possibility of extending
the responsibilities of the fourth official and an evaluation of
experiments currently being conducted on the Laws of the Game.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Deny ceasefire Agreement with Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 12 (Xinhua) - The Afghan Taliban militia
Friday denied reports that they have struck a ceasefire accord
with their rivals.
</P>
<P>
There was no ceasefire agreement in the Ashgabad talks.
However, the two sides agreed on the exchange of prisoners,
Taliban sources here said.
</P>
<P>
Senior Taliban officials and representatives of the opposition
commander, Ahmed Shah Masood, held talks in Turkmenistan on
Wednesday under the aegis of the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Maulvi Abdur Rahman Zahid, a senior Taliban official for
foreign affairs, led the Taliban team in the talks while Abdul
Karim Hashmi and Amrullah Saleh represented opposition commander
Masood.
</P>
<P>
It was the first high-level face-to-face meeting between the
two warring Afghan factions after the collapse of their talks in
Islamabad in May last year. The five-day talks in Islamabad had
failed to produce any result.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, controlling 90 percent of the Afghan territory,
have been under tremendous pressure to begin talks with the
opposition and find out a negotiated settlement of the
long-standing crisis in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban had been declining dialogue with their
foes.
</P>
<P>
The two warring Afghan factions discussed procedure for the
exchange of the prisoners and agreed to hand over lists of their
prisoners to each other.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here believe that isolation of the Taliban in the
world community and continued pressure forced the hard-line
Islamic militia to enter into dialogue with their rivals.
</P>
<P>
They said that the latest meeting between the Taliban and the
opposition was aimed at creating understanding on various issues
before the forthcoming meeting of the Six Plus Two (Afghanistan's
six immediate neighbors plus the U.S. and Russia) in Tashkent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Taliban delegation met with Turkmenistan's
Foreign Minister Sheikh Boris Muradov and discussed bilateral
issues, focusing on promotion of trade ties between the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> EDS-repeats with correction of figures in Para 4 World Patent Registration Sets New Record in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The World Intellectual Property
Organization (WIPO) received 67,007 international patent
applications from all over the world in 1998, representing a 23.1
percent increase over 1997, WIPO head said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The rate of growth in the use of the PCT (Patent Cooperation
Treaty) system in 1998 is very promising," said WIPO Director
General Kamil Idris. "This positive trend suggests that users are
increasingly recognizing the advantages the PCT system offers to
them in seeking patent protection in a large number of countries."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Idris called on all PCT members, in
particular developing countries, to take advantage of this unique
system that allows an applicant to seek patent protection in any
of the 98 member countries of the PCT through the filing of a
single "international" application.
</P>
<P>
According to WTPO's revised statistics released on Friday
afternoon, inventors in the United States continued to be the
biggest user of the PCT in 1998, with 42.3 percent of all
applications, followed by their counterparts in Germany (13.6
percent, Japan (9.1 percent), United Kingdom (6.5 percent) and
France (5.0 percent).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, WIPO statistics demonstrate growing use of the PCT
by several developing countries. In 1998, Azerbaijan, Vietnam, and
Zimbabwe began to use the system for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, Cuba, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Indonesia, Mexico,
Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Turkey, Ukraine and Uzbekistan made
greater use of the PCT, according to the statistics.

<HEADLINE> EU Approves Opening Banking Joint Venture in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
here on Friday that it had approved the establishment of a joint
venture in the Greek banking sector after a month-long
investigation.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU)'s executive body concluded that the
operation between Inchcape Holdings Hellas and EFG Eurobank does
not raise any competition concerns in the Greek market for
consumer financing services.
</P>
<P>
Although under a legal obligation to provide the full spectrum
of banking services, the joint venture, to be called Autofin S.A.,
is intended to be active mainly in the provision of consumer
financing for the purchase of new and used cars, motorcycles and
leisure boats, the commission noted.
</P>
<P>
The operation is not likely to raise serious doubts about its
compatibility with the common market, mainly due to the low
combined market shares in the Greek market for consumer finance
and the presence of a range of competitors, said the European
Commission.

<HEADLINE> Action Against Alleged Bribery Officials Needs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Friday it is premature to take action against
officials who have been linked to a reported 75,000-U.S.-dollar
bribery attempt without solid evidence.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that he has full trust and confidence in
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora and Budget and Management
Secretary Benjamin Diokno.
</P>
<P>
"I have not accepted any resignation letter ... I believe we
have to go deeper and find out who is the real culprit," Estrada
said.
</P>
<P>
An earlier report quoted Santiago Toledo, director of the
National Bureau of Investigation, as saying that a businesswoman
last month delivered a package containing 3 million pesos (75,000
U.S. dollars) to the office of Benjamin Diokno.
</P>
<P>
The woman later claimed in her sworn affidavit that the money
was intended to the government's Deputy Executive Secretary
Vicente de la Serna and his executive assistant Ricardo Fulgencio,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The bribery attempt was linked to a deal of 200 million pesos
(5 million U.S. dollars) with the Department of Education, Culture
and Sports, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Build Imitation of Old Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's leading
industrial and commercial city, plans to build in May an imitation
of an old street this year to highlight its 700 year old history
and culture.
</P>
<P>
The 825 meter-long street, to be located in the famous Yuyuan
Commercial and Tourist Zone in downtown Shanghai, will be lined
with more than 100 specialty stores, workshops and cultural and
recreational facilities modeled on the style of the Ming (1368-
1644) and Qing (1633-1911) dynasties.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is one of the country's oldest commercial cities,
boasting many well-known businesses and buildings with unique
characteristics of their own. Yet there has been a tendency in
recent years for them to be replaced by modern shopping centers
and new high-rise buildings.
</P>
<P>
According to a local government official, such businesses as
pottery workshops, teahouses and bean curd workshops are to be set
up along the western section of the street, aiming to make a
showcase of various past local trades.
</P>
<P>
The eastern section will mainly be reserved for famous shops
from other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
A theater and an outdoor stage for presenting local opera
performances will also be constructed.

<HEADLINE> EU Outlines Measures on Patent Protection Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
here on Friday that it has outlined a series of concrete measures
to improve the framework for obtaining patent protection in the
European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The EU executive body said these measures will include a
proposal for establishing a unitary EU protection of inventions
related to computer programs, an policy document on freedom of
establishment and freedom to provide services for patent agents
and a pilot project to support efforts by national patent offices
to promote innovation.
</P>
<P>
Commissioner for the single market Mario Monti said that this
coherent policy framework lays the foundations for ensuring that
pan-EU patent protection can be obtained more easily than at
present.
</P>
<P>
"This will serve to promote investment in innovation, which is
so crucial to employment, growth and competitiveness in the EU,"
Monti said.
</P>
<P>
"We have made the introduction of a unitary patent valid
throughout the single market a political priority in accordance
with the clearly expressed demands of users and of the European
Parliament for adequate protection at a reasonable cost and with
optimum legal certainty."
</P>
<P>
Other additional measures will result in a substantial
improvement in the EU's patent system to the benefit of innovative
European businesses, said the commissioner.

<HEADLINE> Dasa, Lockheed Form Rocket Joint Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Daimler Chrysler Aerospace (Dasa)
has formed a rocket joint venture with US company Lockheed Martin
in the latest shifting of the international aerospace industry
landscape, a Dasa spokesman said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"This is a sign that we also have very good connections with US
partners and are increasing such cooperation," the spokesman said,
noting the stronger German-American corporate rapport since the
merger which created the parent DaimlerChrysler company.
</P>
<P>
The new company, to be based in the town of Unterschleissheim,
near the south German city Munich, will be in charge of producing
specialized components, testing and logistics for the "Patriot"
PAC-3 anti-missile missile.
</P>
<P>
Dasa was rebuffed late last year in its efforts to merge with
British Aerospace, which instead chose to merge with GEC Marconi
to create Europe's largest defense weaponry corporation.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Dasa was continuing to keep its
European options open and that talks with potential partners were
continuing. On Thursday, Dasa chairman Manfred Bischoff met with
French government officials to discuss related business.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Senate's secret deliberations in President Bill Clinton'
s impeachment trial wound toward a finish on Thursday, as a fourth
Republican announced plans to reject both articles, pushing
conviction supporters within a single vote of failing to win even
a simple majority against the president when the Senate casts its
votes on Friday.
</P>
<P>
-- First Lady Hillary Clinton has been the object of
speculation regarding a bid for the U.S. Senate, and some
Democrats say she will "seriously consider" running for a seat in
New York once President Clinton's impeachment trial ends.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Defying a Federal judge's order to end their protest and
return to work, more pilots called in sick at American Airlines on
Thursday, forcing the carrier to cancel more than half of its
flights and insuring that its operations would be crippled during
the Presidents' Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
-- The Clinton Administration is being pressed by NATO allies
to decide by the middle of next week whether American troops will
be sent to Kosovo as part of a peacekeeping force. NATO's
operational plan for Kosovo is expected to be approved by midweek,
and the precise composition of the force would be determined soon
after that.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- The NASDAK composite index soared 96.06 points, or 4.16
percent to 2405.55, its biggest point move ever and its ninth best
in percentage terms. Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan helped
spark the rally with positive comments on banking reform and
praise for the economy's strength.
</P>
<P>
-- Major U.S. steelmakers are in the final stages of preparing
a second round of unfair trade complaints against several
countries and could file them as early as next week, according to
people familiar with the plans.

<HEADLINE> Aziz Calls for Resolving "Fundamental Differences" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Pak-Indian relations
will remain stunted unless India demonstrates its willingness to
work for the resolution of "fundamental differences" between the
two countries, Pakistan Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz Friday.
</P>
<P>
India must go beyond its present emphasis on the peripheral
areas of bilateral relations. "The confidence building measures
are not an end in itself," Aziz said at a luncheon he hosted in
honor of the participants at the first ever Indo-Pak Parliamentary
Conference.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 members of parliament from India and Pakistan are
here to participate in the two-day event, an unofficial Indo-Pak
parliamentary conference which began Friday.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said, sans progress on the core issue of Kashmir, the
Indo-Pak relations will continue to be plagued by mutual mistrust
and suspicion. This will inhibit normalization and growth in their
bilateral relations, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Unless, we can move towards a settlement of the Kashmir
dispute on the basis of respect for the inherent right of
self-determination of the Kashmiri people, peace will continue to
elude South Asia. This is the obvious lesson of the last 50 years.
There is no escape from this fact," said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that the Kashmir dispute was a nuclear flashpoint and
it must be settled in accordance with the wishes of Kashmiris.
</P>
<P>
He said that for too long India and Pakistan have been engaged
in an unproductive arms race at the cost of the economic
prosperity and development of the common men in both countries.
"This cycle needs to be broken," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said, Pakistan, was committed to continuing dialogue with
India in its desire to find just solutions to all outstanding
issues between the two countries, including Jammu and Kashmir and
the issues related to regional peace and security.
</P>
<P>
In the present nuclearized environment, tensions and
hostilities carry even greater risks both for Pakistan and India
as well as the region and beyond, said Aziz, adding that "the
current situation, if allowed to drift, is fraught with many
dangers."
</P>
<P>
He also said that Pakistan would like to see a vibrant India
engaged in mutually beneficial cooperation with all its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to see a south Asia that is free of poverty and
economic deprivation," Aziz said. "South Asia can become a major
new destination for foreign investment in what observers called
the `Fourth Wave' of the Asian miracle."
</P>
<P>
"But to take full advantage of these opportunities, we have to
improve the security environment of the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister urged Indian members of parliament to make
important contributions to ensure that the present Pak-India
bilateral process does not relapse into a dialogue for the sake of
dialogue.

<HEADLINE> Cholera Breaks out in Northern Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 12 (Xinhua) -- There are reports of serious
cholera breaking out in the famine-stricken border region of Gedo,
northern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest reports from the town of Bardera in
Gedo region, 14 people, mainly women and children, died of cholera
on Thursday alone, while 82 others were also hospitalized after
falling for the disease.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Jama Ber, the governor of the region, said through the
VHF radio in the regional capital, Garbahaffey Town, that the
cholera disease is spreading in the community very fast, affecting
over 100 people per day. He characterized the situation as
desperate and alarming.
</P>
<P>
Local health authorities said severe diarrhea and dysentery are
also accompanying the cholera.  Ber said there's no single aid
agency fighting against the spread of the disease in the region
following what is called the temporary evacuation of the
international staff from the area in protest against the killing
of a Kenyan aid worker serving the Italian aid agency, Terra
Nuoya, in the region two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The local authorities also attributed the fast spread of the
disease to the water scarcity in the area especially in the remote
villages and the countryside. Reports said the situation has been
aggravated by the local movement of large number of families
displaced by famine and water shortage.
</P>
<P>
Ber said the current drought is the worst since 1974 when main
devastating Dabadher drought claimed the lives of thousands of
people
</P>
<P>
The authorities are complaining about the arrival of large
number of people coming from the regions of Bay, Bakol, Middle
Jubba and northeastern Kenya.  In Bulo Hawo Town of Gedo region
alone, over 500 refugees have crossed from the Kenyan border in
the past five days, said the district commissioner Haji Yussuf
Musa Abdi.
</P>
<P>
More than 8,000 families are now believed to be on the move in
search of food and water in Gedo region alone, while more than
4,000 other families are moving around in Bay region following the
prolonged drought and civil war that ravaged those regions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, over 700,000 people are believed to be suffering
from serious food shortage in southern Somalia following
insufficient rainfalls in the region in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The nomadic societies are equally suffering from the drought
after ban was imposed on Somalia's livestock exports to the Gulf
countries last year.
</P>
<P>
Over 80 percent of Somalia's population depend on the
livestock, especially the camels and goats, as the country's
largest exported item to the Arab countries.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Emphasizes Adherence To Multi-party Cooperation System (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin said
today that China must adhere to the system of multi-party
cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the
Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
There can be no ambiguity in this political principle and it
complies with China's actual conditions, Jiang told a forum for
non-Party personnel for the Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
He extended new year's greetings to China's 8 non-Communist
parties, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and
people without party affiliation on behalf of the CPC Central
Committee and the State Council and praised their efforts in
political consultation, democratic supervision and participation
in political and government affairs over the past year.
</P>
<P>
He said that 1999 has special significance in China's
development because the country will celebrate its 50th birth
anniversary and resume exercise of sovereignty over Macao this
year.
</P>
<P>
The reforms are now at a critical period and people need to
work hard to settle problems in the economic and social life, he
said, reminding the audience that the effects of the Asian
financial crisis are still being felt in China, and economic
globalization is bringing both opportunities and challenges to
development.
</P>
<P>
"To realize the objectives of the reforms and construction, and
to maintain a stable society and sustainable economic growth, we
must continue to promote the political advantage of the patriotic
united front," he said.

<P>
He said that China needs scientific analysis and to identify
risks and difficulties and its own advantages and strength and
asked non-Communist parties, the All-China Federation of Industry
and Commerce, and people everywhere to make a joint effort in the
socialist modernization cause.
</P>
<P>
Practice has shown that China's multi-party co-operation and
political consultation system under the leadership of the
Communist Party has its own advantages and vitality and provides
powerful political backing for reforms, development and stability,
he said.
</P>
<P>
This year will be the 50th anniversary of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference and the domestic and global
situation puts new demand on China's multi-party co-operation and
political consultation system, he said, and with the guidance of
Deng Xiaoping's concept of multi-party cooperation, China needs to
work hard to improve this system and to make full use of it in the
new circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the forum were Li Ruihuan and Hu Jintao and
leaders of the central committees of China's 8 non-Communist
parties, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and
some people without party affiliations.

<HEADLINE> Pak, Indian Lawmakers Call for Negotiated Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Lawmakers of Pakistan and
India Friday called for a negotiated settlement of bilateral
disputes between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
They made the call at the first Indo-Pak Parliamentary
Conference which started here Friday and was attended by about 100
delegates from the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Problems could not be solved through use of force," said Ehali
Bakhsh Soomro, Speaker of Pakistan's National Assembly, stressing
the need for the settlement of disputes through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Indian delegation Balram Jakbar said that the two
countries should avoid bloodshed and settle differences through
talks, saying "we should talk against war and for the promotion of
peace."
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Yasin Khan Watto
reiterated Pakistan's call for the peaceful solution to the
Kashmir issue, saying that without the settlement of the core
issue, the goal of progress in other fields could not be achieved.
</P>
<P>
However, the Indian members of parliament called for settlement
of minor issues first to create better environment for
negotiations on key disputes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the lawmakers from both countries lauded what they
called genuine efforts by the two governments to improve relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
They welcomed the Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee's
forthcoming visit to Pakistan on February 20 and the proposed bus
service from New Delhi to Pakistan's second biggest city of
Lahore.
</P>
<P>
They hoped that these measures will reduce tension between the
two countries and result in better mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
Some 35 lawmakers members from the two houses of the Indian
parliament, including those from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party
and the main opposition Congress Party, and more than 60 members
from all the parties in the Pakistani parliament are participating
the two-day conference aiming at giving impetus "towards detente
in the sub-continent."

<HEADLINE> HK to Resume Land Sales in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will resume its
land sales beginning April this year after suspending them for 10
months, a government official announced here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government will implement a one-year Land Sales Program
from April 1999 to March 2000 and a four-year Land Development
Program from April 2000 to March 2004.
</P>
<P>
Gordon Siu Kwing-chue, secretary for Planning, Environment and
Land, said: "Our policy objective is to ensure stability in the
property market and to provide sufficient land to meet our long
term needs."
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that this will be achieved by
introducing a modest Land Sale Program for 1999-2000, coupled with
a new "Application System" whereby developers may apply for sale
of sites from a "reserve list."
</P>
<P>
"The flexibility offered by this new mechanism will enable us
to respond to market demand while maintaining overall stability,"
Siu said.
</P>
<P>
"The combination of sites in the reserve list with a regular
land auction and tender program enables the market to decide the
optimum amount of land to be made available for disposal and the
timing for releasing additional land," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
From April 1, 1999 to March 31, 2000, auctions and tenders will
be conducted in accordance with a sale timetable for individual
sites occupying a total of 14 hectares of land for private housing,
15 hectares for the Private Sector Participation scheme and two
hectares for non-housing uses.
</P>
<P>
Under the application system, a developer who is interested in
any site on the reserve list may apply to the government and offer
a minimum price.
</P>
<P>
If the government considers the price reasonable, it will put
up the site for sale by public auction or tender as appropriate.
</P>
<P>
The amount of land available for sale under the Application
System includes 22 hectares for private housing and 11 hectares
for non-housing uses.
</P>
<P>
"The government remains committed to its public housing program
of an average of 50,000 units per year and will continue to
develop land for this purpose," Siu said.

<P>
CHONGQING, China, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Star striker Hao
Haidong found the net twice to help four-time Chinese league
champion Dalian Wanda beat Jubilo Iwata of Japan 2-0 in a quarter-
final group match of the Asian club championship on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Dalian, defending runner-up for the tournament, went two points
clear in the east Asian quarter-final group.
</P>
<P>
Reigning champion Pohang Steelers fought to a 1-1 draw with
fellow South Korean Pusan Daewoo in the other match.
</P>
<P>
The top two from the four-team section qualify for the
semifinals at the end of April.
</P>
<P>
Hao, arguably the best striker of China, put the host team to a
flying start as he headed home a pass from Wang Tao just 30
minutes into action.
</P>
<P>
At the 28th minute of the second half, Hao connected Vaclav
Nemecek's pass with the right foot and blasted with the left the
ball into the net from 20 meters.
</P>
<P>
In the all South Korean match, Pohang striker Park Sang-in
tapped in from close range in the 15th minute from a perfect pass
by captain Park Tae-ha.
</P>
<P>
Two minutes later Pusan made it even as Croatian defender
Jasenko Sabitovic slid on to Jung Jae-kwon's cross from the right
as goalkeeper Kim Lee-sup hesitated.

<HEADLINE> Getting To Know A New Madam Curie On Chinese Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Marie Curie, the Polish Nobel
Prize winner, will appear on the Chinese stage this April, but
with a new image in a French comedy.
</P>
<P>
The comedy, "The Palm of Mr.Schutz", written by Jean Noel
Fenwick in 1989, which won 4 Moliere Awards the following year and
has been performed more than 2,000 times in 17 countries, will be
performed by a cast from the Chinese Youth Art Theater.
</P>
<P>
The play's Chinese director, Wei Xiaoping, a graduate of China'
s Central Drama Institute who studied in France, was impressed by
the new image the play gave of Marie Curie who has been
stereotyped in textbooks as a woman who cared for nothing but
science and he decided to translate the play, along with his
French wife Pascale Wei.
</P>
<P>
The comedy is based on some Pierre and Marie Curie anecdotes,
with artistic touches added. Marie Curie totally removes her mask
of seriousness and steps off the pedestal down into the mundane
world, according to Wei.
</P>
<P>
This Mme. Curie often jests with her future husband, Pierre,
who initially avoided women in his life but was overcome by this
playful, intelligent, and persevering girl student. They go to the
theater, concerts, and the countryside where they can enjoy
culture and nature in the little time they have and they deal with
obstacles in the path to their discovery of radium.
</P>
<P>
Wei once talked with the French playwright about Marie Curie's
image, a woman who could have been more vivid portrayed. Devoting
one's life to science doesn't mean denying joy in life and, in
fact, a great scientist could possibly cherish life more than
anyone else precisely because the free time is so precious,
something that is conveyed by the play.
</P>
<P>
The cast includes some of the most brilliant names in Chinese
theater. The play will start at Beijing's Chang'an Theater on
April 9.
</P>
<P>
France's Curie and Joliot-Curie Association has offered more
than 50 photos from the family album to be used in the theater.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Urges U.S. Businessmen to Invest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I appeal to the U.S. businessmen to think afresh not only for
trade but also for joint-venture projects in Bangladesh," Kibria
said while inaugurating a three-day U.S. trade show here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is a capital-short country and is seeking foreign
investment with its very liberal policy, he stated.
</P>
<P>
Terming the U.S. as one of the principal sources of investment,
he urged the U.S. businessmen participating in the trade show to
discuss joint-venture investment with Bangladeshi businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The trade show will provide an opportunity for introducing U.S.
products in Bangladesh and facilitate interactions between
businessmen of the two countries, he noted, adding that this will
enhance bilateral cooperation in the areas of trade and
investment.
</P>
<P>
In the 1997-98 fiscal year, there was a trade balance of 1.6
billion U.S. dollars in favor of Bangladesh, and U.S. exports to
Bangladesh remained at 250-300 million dollars while Bangladesh's
apparel exports in 1997-98 were worth 1.9 billion dollars and it
is expected to increase to about 2 billion dollars this year.

<HEADLINE> Ruling Party Seeks Revision of National Security Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 12 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's ruling National
Congress for New Politics (NCNP) Friday said it plans to consult
with the government about the National Security Law, which
concerns South Koreans' contact with Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
"We are planning to hold a consultative meeting with the
government in March or April to revise the law by June," said a
senior NCNP official Friday.
</P>
<P>
NCNP Acting President Cho Se-hyung reported the plan to
President Kim Dae-jung when he met Kim for weekly party affairs
Thursday, said the official.
</P>
<P>
However, the NCNP will make a final decision on whether or not
to revise the law after consulting with its coalition partner, the
United Liberal Democrats (ULD), the official said.
</P>
<P>
The security law, which was passed in 1948 and revised several
times thereafter, bans South Koreans from making unauthorized
contact with Koreans in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party is expected to seek revision of, among other
things, article seven, under which a person could be sentenced to
up to seven years in prison when convicted of praising an anti-
state organization.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the article has often been abused by law-
enforcement authorities to suppress dissidents or political
activities.
</P>
<P>
President Kim has in the past vowed to replace the security law
with a new act on the "defense of the democratic order".
</P>
<P>
The revision plan is expected to meet strong objection not only
from the opposition Grand National Party, but also from the
coalition partner, ULD, said analysts.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Civilian Killed in U.S. Missile Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 12 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi civilian was killed
and tens of others injured on Friday during U.S. missile attacks
on civilian targets in northern Iraq, an Iraqi military
spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was quoted by the Iraqi News Agency INA as saying
that nine formations of U.S. warplanes from a Turkish military
base violated Iraq's northern airspace Friday morning and launched
missiles at the Iraqi air defense sites in Dohuk province and
north Mosul.
</P>
<P>
Since late last month when U.S.-British warplanes bombarded
residential quarters in southern Iraq's Basra province till now,
28 civilians have been killed and over 100 others injured during
U.S.-British missile and bomb attacks in several incidents.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, two Iraqi civilians were killed and several
others were injured when U.S. warplanes attacked civilian targets
in northern Iraq's Neineva province, INA reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in
Iraq in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim
of protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims
in the south from "Baghdad's suppression."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain air-raided Iraq in mid-December to
retaliate what they claimed Iraq's non-cooperation with U.N. arms
inspectors in charge of eliminating Iraq's banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
After that attacks, Iraq announced that it does not not
recognize the no-fly zones and would fire at U.S. and British
jets patrolling the zones. Clashes between Iraqi air defense
units and U.S.-British warplanes have almost become daily
occurrence.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz has said that Iraq would
go on confronting U.S.-British warplanes violating Iraqi airspace
regardless of the sacrifices and consequences.

<HEADLINE> EU Foreign Ministers to be Briefed on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 12 (Xinhua) - European Union foreign ministers
are to meet on Sunday for a briefing on the Kosovo peace talks
being held at Rambouillet outside Paris, Bonn Foreign Office
spokesman Martin Erdmann said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting would take place in Paris after a meeting of the
international Contact Group made up of the United States, Britain,
France, Germany, Italy and Russia on the same day.
</P>
<P>
The contact group is planning to take stock of the peace talks
and decide whether to extend them for another week or declare them
a failure.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said the
peace conference would be extended by another week.
</P>
<P>
After the Contact Group meeting, German Foreign Joschka Fischer,
who is also EU president, will brief those of his EU counterparts
whose countries are not members of the contact group.
</P>
<P>
Erdmann stressed that this EU meeting was not being called to
put pressure on the Serbs and Kosovo Albanians. Instead, it will
take stock and discuss a possible strategy for a final week of
talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile NATO ambassadors met in Brussels Friday morning to
discuss strengthening NATO forces in Macedonia in preparation for
a mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The current force of 2,300 troops could be boosted to about 10,
000 to enable it to enforce an interim peace agreement. If the
Rambouillet talks were to fail, however, such a force would not be
needed, as NATO in that case is threatening to use air strikes
only.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea Unveils Defense Programs for Next Five Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 12 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will invest some 26.
7 trillion won (21.36 billion U.S. dollars) over the next five
years in an ambitious weapons buying program, the Defense Ministry
announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
The programs are composed of the destroyer-building project
code-named KDX-III, the next-generation fighter program, purchases
of attack helicopters, surface-to-air missiles and unmanned aerial
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The weapons procurement program is part of the 81.5 trillion
won (67.15 billion dollars) defense expenditure plan to be
implemented over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The defense budget for the year 2000 will be 14.5 trillion won
(11.95 billion dollars), up from this year's 13.7 trillion won (11.
3 billion dollars), a spokesman for the Defense Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said it will cost more than 2.1 trillion won (1.
73 billion dollars) to acquire anti-tank attack helicopters such
as Apache or Tiger.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean army now has less advanced Cobra attack
helicopters, and the new program will upgrade the Army's anti-tank
attack capability.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean Navy will have three Aegis-class destroyers
within 10 years under a medium-term defense procurement project.
</P>
<P>
As for the next-generation fighter program, the ministry said
it was planning to buy some 60 new fighters.
</P>
<P>
Among its choices are Rafale of France, Eurofighter produced by
a European consortium, F-15 of the United States and Russia's
Sukhoi-35.
</P>
<P>
By early next year when the South Korea Fighter Program
finishes, the air force will acquire 120 F-16 Fighting Falcon jet
fighters. Twelve of the F-16s were manufactured by U.S. Lockheed
Martin, and the rest were assembled or produced by Samsung.
</P>
<P>
A program code-named SAM-X is related to the purchase either of
U.S.-made Patriot missiles or Russia's S-300 air defense system.
Under another program, an undisclosed number of unmanned
surveillance aircraft worth 100 billion won (82.4 million dollars)
will be bought in 2001 to 2002. The South Korean army already has
Israeli-made unmanned surveillance vehicles.
</P>
<P>
A program to build new submarines, code-named SSU, will start
in October this year, said the ministry spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Iran Warns Azerbaijan not to Invite U.S. to Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Former Iranian President
Hashemi Rafsanjani here on Friday warned the Republic of
Azerbaijan not allow the U.S. and NATO to set up military bases on
its soil.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Friday prayers congregation on the campus of
Tehran University, Rafsanjani criticized the recent proposal of
some Azeri officials for presence of U.S. and NATO forces in
Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
The move is a "tremendous portend danger" against the region,
he said, stressing that "the Caspian Sea is a peaceful region and
one of our biggest economic centers," the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"It is very strange to observe why Azerbaijan wants to commit
such an ugly act of paving the way for the presence of the U.S and
NATO in the Caspian and Caucasian region, which will ultimately
cost not only Azerbaijan but whole of the region to pay a high
price for such an adventure," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, current chairman of the powerful advisory State
Expediency Council, warned Azerbaijan to think of "the deleterious
effects in the future and its remorse" for paving the way for the
presence of the U.S. and NATO in the region.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the Azeri officials would take heed of
the crucial issue and not permit the region to be contaminated
and be embroiled in unpredictable events.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, several Azeri officials stated that Azerbaijan
should allow the U.S. or NATO to set up military bases in their
country in order to challenge the threat from Russia and other
regional countries.
</P>
<P>
Senior Iranian officials have stated that Iran would not remain
indifferent if Azerbaijan allows the presence of U.S. and NATO
forces in the former Soviet Republic.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Smashes Israeli Spy Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese army intelligence has
smashed a spy ring working for Israel in Lebanon, the National
Broadcasting Network radio reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 alleged members of the ring, who are suspected of
providing information about activities of the Lebanese army and
anti-Israeli guerrillas to Israeli secret service, have been
arrested and are under interrogation.
</P>
<P>
The intelligence is searching across the country for other
members at large.
</P>
<P>
The ring was cracked down shortly after a senior intelligence
officer of the Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army (SLA) defected to
the Lebanese army.
</P>
<P>
He fled Friday with his wife and three-year-old son the village
of Shebaa in the eastern sector of the Israeli occupied border
zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops and the SLA have since been laying siege to
Shabaa, imposing a curfew and conducting daily house raids to find
out how the SLA officer escaped.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Tibet
Autonomous Region had trained 51,000 ethnic officials by the end
of 1998, accounting for 75 percent of the total officials in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
To date, the amount of ethnic officials makes up 78 percent of
the total officials in the regional government, 67 percent in
prefectural government and 62 percent at magisterial level.
</P>
<P>
Since he became secretary of the magisterial committee of the
Communist Party of China, Puncog, an official who was born and
brought up in Tibet, has succeeded in transforming the formerly
poor Gyangze County and pushed forward its comprehensive
development.
</P>
<P>
There are now numerous ethnic officials like Puncog in Tibet
all playing important roles in regional economic development, said
a local government official.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic officials were trained either in Tibet or other
parts of China. The region has built 10 institutes of higher
learning, eight schools for administration and management skills
and 10 party schools, which train 10,000 ethnic cadres annually.
Meanwhile, some 1,000 Tibetans are sent to provincial universities
each year.

<HEADLINE> Indo, Pak MPs Deliberate on Treaties to Reduce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The parliamentarians from
Pakistan and India Friday started deliberations on three draft
treaties to reduce the risk of nuclear war nine months after their
governments conducted nuclear tests in May last year.
</P>
<P>
About 100 elected representatives from the two neighbors
attended the first ever Indo-Pak parliamentary conference here
which was titled "Towards Detente in the subcontinent".
</P>
<P>
The three draft treaties taken up by the conference included
agreements on risk-reducing measures of outbreak of a nuclear war,
advanced warnings on ballistic missile tests and prevention of a
nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
The conference will consider the draft treaties which if they
agreed to, the parliamentarians will call upon the respective
governments to sign.
</P>
<P>
The first draft treaty requires both parties "to maintain and
to improve their existing organizational and technical
arrangements to guard against the accidental or unauthorized use
of nuclear weapons."
</P>
<P>
It also calls on the two sides to instantly exchange
information about any accidental test.
</P>
<P>
The second draft treaty binds both countries to "act in such a
manner as to prevent the development of situations capable of
causing a dangerous exacerbation of their relations, as to avoid a
military confrontation, and as to exclude the outbreak of a
nuclear war between them."
</P>
<P>
The third draft treaty calls for instant negotiations in case
of an imminent threat of nuclear war between the two.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-five parliamentary members from India's major parties
including the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the main
opposition Congress Party Friday sat face to face with their
Pakistani counterparts in the first ever non-official dialogue
among them on major issues that confront the two south Asian
nations.
</P>
<P>
Twenty members from the ruling Pakistan Muslim League (PML)
attended the meeting, while the main opposition Pakistan People's
Party (PPP) led by former prime minister Benazir Mhutto also took
part in the event.

<HEADLINE> China's Smaller Firms Expected to Boost Economic Growth (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, February 12 (Xinhua) -- As China's market-economy reform
moves deeper, small and medium-sized enterprises are becoming a
major growth factor amid an overall tight economic environment at
home and abroad, according to some observers.
</P>
<P>
The development of the Chinese economy, of course, needs the
participation of large enterprises. But the small and medium
firms, with their relatively flexible operations, are an important
force for boosting supply and demand, and thereby stimulating
economic growth. This is needed at a time of worldwide economic
uncertainty, said Wu Jinglian, a noted economist with the
Development and Research Center of the State Council, China's
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
After decades of a planned economy, the majority of China's
large state-owned enterprises have been plagued by overstaffing,
poor management, and low efficiency. In the economic
transformation that began in the late 1970s, the small and medium
firms have generally performed better than the larger ones in
becoming more market-driven and efficiency-oriented.
</P>
<P>
The Zhonglian Environmental Protection Equipment Co. Ltd. in
east China's Anhui Province was formed on the basis of Anhui No. 1
Textile Machinery, which went bankrupt in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to its flexible operations in developing the most
advanced type of sewage treatment systems in China, this company
was able to turn in 1.62 million yuan in taxes last year, more
than triple the amount for 1997.
</P>
<P>
"As a small business, we don't have any capital advantage, and
have had to play entirely by market principles," said company
chairman Hu Ziwei.
</P>
<P>
In Anhui, the cradle of China's rural reforms, there are an
increasing number of small and medium-sized firms which have
succeeded on the basis of flexible operations and improved
management.

<HEADLINE> Food Surveillance Improved in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 12 (Xinhua) -- More food samples were taken
for microbiological and chemical testings in Hong Kong in the
first 11 months of 1998, the Department of Health announced here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Director of Health Dr. Gloria Tam pointed out that
some 50,000 samples were taken for microbiological testings during
the period as compared with 48,000 food samples taken for testing
for the corresponding period in 1997 and 43,000 samples in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The increase was due to more testings done for poultry and
shellfish in 1998.
</P>
<P>
This was in response to outbreaks of avian flu and cholera
respectively.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the number of samples taken for testing is
equivalent to a sampling ratio of eight per 1,000 people annually
and compares favorably with the internationally accepted standard
of three per 1,000 people every year.
</P>
<P>
The microbiological testings results indicated that there were
significant improvements in two categories of foods, namely fish
and shellfish, she said.
</P>
<P>
As for chemical testings, 32,000 food samples had been taken
for chemical testings in 1998. This was a substantial increase
over the 31,000 samples tested in 1997 and 27,000 samples tested
in 1996. The increase was mainly due to more testings done for
pesticides and beta-agonists in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of unsatisfactory samples tested for chemicals
were 1.56 in 1998, 1.38 in 1997 and 1.7 in 1996. The 1998's figure
would have shown more improvements had it not been for the finding
of ciguatera in coral reef fish and beta-agonists in pork and pig'
s internal organs.
</P>
<P>
Together, the two sets of microbiological and chemical testing
figures indicated that the overall food hygiene standard in Hong
Kong was improving, Tam said.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Inject Public Funds Into 15 Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Financial Reconstruction
Commission (FRC) decided Friday to inject 7.45 trillion yen (64.8
billion U.S. dollars) in public funds into 15 major banks in a bid
to relieve the banking crisis that is hampering the country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
The commission, a government body charged with reviving the
banking sector, has been negotiating with the banks over the
disposal of their bad debts and replenishment of their capital
bases, to restore confidence in the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
The commission made the decision and relayed it to each of the
banks after a preliminary screening of the banks' plans to write
off bad loans and restructure their operations.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the commission show that Japan's
financial institutions had more than 73 trillion yen (634.8
billion dollars) in bad loans as of September 1998, accounting for
12.2 percent to the total credit volume.
</P>
<P>
According to the commission, individual banks will receive
varying sums depending on their financial situation.
</P>
<P>
The government will pay the funds by purchasing preferred
stocks in the banks.
</P>
<P>
The banks include Sumitomo Bank, Sanwa Bank, Dai-Ichi Kangyo
Bank, Fuji Bank and Sakura Bank.
</P>
<P>
Japan's largest commercial bank, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi,
declined to accept the government offer of financial aid, saying
it can raise funds from private companies.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's PDP Party to Pick Presidential Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former head of state Olusegun Obasanjo and former
vice-president Alex Ekwueme are among the seven presidential
aspirants of the party, PDP's National Publicity Secretary,
Senator Anietie Okon said Thursday in capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
The seven aspirants will contest the presidential ticket of the
party at the PDP special national convention scheduled to be held
on Saturday and Sunday in Jos, Plateau State, local media Friday
quoted Okon as saying.
</P>
<P>
Okon said that 2,500 delegates will participate in the
convention for nominating the presidential flagbearer of the party
for the February 27 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
General Obasanjo enunciated a six-point agenda for national
reconstruction when he addressed Zamfara State delegates to the
national convention on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agenda, Obasanjo will give priority to food and
agriculture, education, investment and employment in his national
reconstruction agenda
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo said that one of the motivating factors for his quest
for political leadership is the challenge to facilitate the
reunification of Nigeria and the reconstruction of decadent
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
If elected, he said, he will facilitate the urgent return of
the country to the league of progressive nations in the world.
</P>
<P>
He regretted that Nigeria who was in 1979 during his tenure as
head of state in the league of the first 50 most prosperous
nations in terms of economic stability, has now plummeted to
become one of the 20 poorest nations in the world.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo said that there was a lot of reformation and
reconstruction to do in the country, maintaining that he is "the
bridge between the North and South of Nigeria, the East and North,
Christians and Muslims, military and civilians and between the
international community and Nigeria."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another PDP presidential aspirant Ekwueme told a
press conference Thursday in Abuja that he believed in the unity
of Nigeria as an indivisible entity, stressing the entire
Federation of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He denied ever advocating confederation or regional army,
saying "There is absolutely no record of where I have ever
advocated confederation for this country; nor that each zone must
have its own separate army."
</P>
<P>
Ekwueme said that in keeping with the vision of the founding
fathers of Nigeria who adopted the federal system in order to
preserve the unity in diversity, he has always been an apostle of
federalism.

<HEADLINE> China's Smaller Firms Expected to Boost Economic Growth (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ninety-nine percent of the officially registered industrial
enterprises in Anhui are small and medium-sized ones, and they
provide 77.3 percent of all jobs in the province, accounting for
60.2 percent of total salaries there, according to Wang Jinyuan,
deputy chief of the Enterprise Section of the Anhui Provincial
Commission for Economic Restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, there are more than 10 million small and medium-
sized businesses in China, about 98.5 percent of all the nation's
enterprises. These enterprises account for 60 percent of the
national industrial output value, and 50 percent of all taxes and
profits. They also provide 70 percent of all jobs in the urban
areas.
</P>
<P>
Mao Yushi, director of the Unirule Institute of Economics in
Beijing, said that small and medium-sized businesses are in a
better position to take advantage of China's low labor costs than
large enterprises, which are often capital intensive.
</P>
<P>
"The small and medium-sized firms are the main locomotive to
activate economic growth at present, as well as a major source of
employment," Mao told Xinhua recently.
</P>
<P>
In recognition of the role played by small and medium-sized
firms in the national economy, Chinese authorities have unveiled a
series of supportive measures in recent years. The State Economic
and Trade Commission last year set up a new department responsible
for drafting policies to aid and steer the growth of these
businesses. And earlier this month, the government announced that
China is establishing a credit guarantee system to help them solve
financing difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that small and medium-sized businesses will play
an important role in ensuring the sustainable, rapid and healthy
growth of the Chinese economy when the overall performance of
large state-owned firms now has proved to be far from satisfactory,
and the economic environment remains uncertain both at home and
abroad.

NAIROBI, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
begun the rehabilitation of the airports and the replacement of
aging air traffic control equipment to ensure air safety and
security in the country.
</P>
<P>
Transport and Communications Minister William Ole Ntimama said
Thursday that the government will improve air navigation
infrastructure in a bid to make the country's airports compliant
with standards of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
In pursuit of aviation safety and low cost of flight operation,
the government will exploit computer-based technology and space
satellites which allow flexible air route structures, the Kenya
Times newspaper Friday quoted Ntimama as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that to guarantee speedy and efficient replacement of
obsolete air control facilities, the government has established an
air traffic management system coordination committee to supervise
the entire airport rehabilitation exercise across the country.
</P>
<P>
Another move will be taken in June to de-link the Directorate
of Civil Aviation (DCA), a regulating body, from the mainstream
civil service.
</P>
<P>
The de-linking will lead to the separation of policy regulators
and formulators from air service providers, such as airliners and
airports, therefore making the DCA more efficient.

<P>
Estrada reiterated that he will exert all efforts to bring
about lasting peace in Mindanao so that its residents can finally
have the fruits of the progress.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The World Intellectual Property
Organization (WIPO) received 67,007 international patent
applications from all over the world in 1998, representing a 23.1
percent increase over 1997, WIPO head said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The rate of growth in the use of the PCT (Patent Cooperation
Treaty) system in 1998 is very promising," said WIPO Director
General Kamil Idris. "This positive trend suggests that users are
increasingly recognizing the advantages the PCT system offers to
them in seeking patent protection in a large number of countries."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Idris called on all PCT members, in
particular developing countries, to take advantage of this unique
system that allows an applicant to seek patent protection in any
of the 98 member countries of the PCT through the filing of a
single "international" application.
</P>
<P>
Inventors in the United States continued to be the biggest user
of the PCT in 1998, with 42.3 percent of all applications,
followed by their counterparts in Germany (13.7 percent, Japan (8.
9 percent), United Kingdom (7.2 percent) and France (4.6 percent).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, WIPO statistics demonstrate growing use of the PCT
by several developing countries. In 1998, Azerbaijan, Vietnam, and
Zimbabwe began to use the system for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, Cuba, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Indonesia, Mexico,
Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Turkey, Ukraine and Uzbekistan made
greater use of the PCT, according to the statistics.

<HEADLINE> Study: Gene May Help Some People Avoid Heart Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists said
Thursday they had found more evidence that a gene that helps
control blood fat levels may let some people escape heart disease
even if they are overweight or have high cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
Kardia and colleagues at the University of Michigan said they
examined 329 men and women, who were under the age of 60 had no
sign of heart disease or stroke.
</P>
<P>
CT scans were used to see how clogged their arteries were, and
then the volunteers's genes were examined, said the scientists who
found a gene called ApoE affects blood cholesterol levels.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said there are three different known versions of
ApoE --ApoE-2, ApoE-3, and ApoE-4 -- and everyone gets two copies
of each gene, so 6 different combinations are possible. Most
people have two ApoE-3 genes, they added.
</P>
<P>
Kardia's team found women who had one ApoE-3 and one ApoE-4
gene had plaque in their arteries if they tended to be overweight
and also had high levels of triglycerides, which are one type of
cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
In men who had one ApoE-3 and one ApoE-4 gene, the risk rose if
they were overweight, but if they just had high cholesterol they
did not have a higher risk, the scientists reported.
</P>
<P>
"These kinds of studies might help explain some of the
variation and have implications for treatment," said Kardia in the
statement issued by the American Heart Association.

<HEADLINE> UK, US Propose UN to Monitor Libyans in Jail for Lockerbie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the latest effort made by Britain and U.S. to break the
stalemate over the Lockerbie airliner bombing and to persuade
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to hand over the suspects for trial
in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
In December,1988, a Pan Am flight was bombed over the Scotland
town of Lockerbie, killing all 270 people on board.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British investigators accused two Libyan agents of
planting the bomb and have been trying to bring the suspects to
face trial in the Netherlands. They also insisted that the two
should serve their sentences in Scotland if convicted their crimes.
</P>
<P>
Libya has declined to let the two suspects face trial, saying
it does not want them to serve their prison sentence in Scotland
if convicted.
</P>
<P>
"In order to counter Libyan claims that these people would be
denied their human rights, we've said we would be happy for U.N.
monitors to attend the jail and ensure they weren't maltreated in
any way," a British Foreign Office spokesman said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan had approved the
proposal and passed it on to Libya in the last two weeks, and was
waiting for a reply.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. monitors would make sure the suspects would not be
interrogated by British or American police or security services as
Libya is concerned, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners' dietary, religious and cultural needs would also
be respected, he said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Britain had proposed that Libya could open a special
consulate in Scotland to have an official presence nearby to
monitor the conditions of the jailed Libyans if they would serve
their sentences there.
</P>
<P>
South African envoy Jakes Gerwel visited Gaddafi this week in a
fresh bid to end the Lockerbie impasse. Britain welcomed in last
week the visit but insisted at the same time that Gerwel would not
negotiate with Libya on behalf of Britain.

<HEADLINE> Phnom Penh's Gun-control Campaign Successful: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The campaign to crack down
on illegal weapons in Phnom Penh, capital of Cambodia, was
successful, according to Phnom Penh's first deputy governor Chea
Sophara.
</P>
<P>
Beginning November 1, 1998, local officials and police went
door to door to ask residents if they had any illegal weapons and
explosives. Except those who have gun licenses, all illegal
weapons must be confiscated or handed over to the municipality
through its "buy-back" scheme.
</P>
<P>
The municipality has been paying 40,000 riel (about 10 U.S.
dollars) for AK-47s, 50,000 riel (about 13 dollars) for shotguns
and 5,000 riel (just over one dollar) for grenades.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures show that of the more than 15,000 households
inspected as of February 2, 9,922 had guns. But only 12 percent of
them were illegal.
</P>
<P>
According to a city official, the municipality so far has
collected 665 guns and at least 70 grenades.
</P>
<P>
Chea Sophara was quoted Friday by the Cambodian Daily as saying
that "We've been receiving illegal weapons every week. I think our
gun-control campaign is successful."
</P>
<P>
The campaign is aimed at reducing the number of illegal weapons
and explosives and ultimately helping to reduce armed crimes in
the capital, Chea Sophara said.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Remains Biggest Refugee Group 10 Years After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 12 (Xinhua) -- With more than 2.6 million
Afghans in exile, Afghanistan remains the single largest refugee
country in the world a decade after the last Soviet soldier left
the Afghan soil, the U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR, said Friday in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement marked the 10th anniversary of the Soviet
withdrawal from Afghanistan falling on February 15, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Since the first batch of Afghans fled the Soviet invasion 20
years ago, Afghanistan has owned the biggest group of refugees in
the world for the consecutive 19 years, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1979 there were already 400,000 Afghan refugees
in Pakistan and other 200,000 in Iran. By February 15, 1989, the
date when the last Soviet soldier stepped out of Afghanistan, the
refugee number had risen to a staggering 6.2 million.
</P>
<P>
Since the Soviet withdrawal, more than 4 million refugees,
almost two thirds of the total, have returned to their country,
according to the statement.

NEW DELHI, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Indian President K. R.
Narayanan Friday called upon the whole country to make all efforts
to put an end to indifference towards the disabled.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating a new training center for the mentally handicapped
in Calcutta, 1,461 km southeast of New Delhi, Narayanan said that
it was the moral obligation of society to pay more attention to
the handicapped people in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Traditionally our society is not oozing with sympathy for the
mentally and physically handicapped. We have to overcome this
attitude," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
India has about 90 million disabled and 24 million of them are
mentally handicapped.
</P>
<P>
The Union government had enacted a law in 1995 ensuring equal
opportunity for the disabled and their participation in the
national life.
</P>
<P>
This law must make a fact of life, the president said, adding
that it was necessary to mobilize the resources of the society and
develop scientific programs to help them conquer their
disabilities and become full participants in the life of the
nation.

</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton is expected to be acquitted on
Friday in a Senate voting which will put an end to his impeachment
process. But the affair could leave the American society the
impact as lasting as the Watergate.
</P>
<P>
-- the Kosovo Talks in Rambouillet should show signs of
progress before Saturday to justify a prolonging of the conference
for another week. The two co-chairmen of the conference, French

Thursday to exert pressure on the Serb and Albanian negotiators.
</P>
<P>
Le Monde:

<P>
-- The American Senate should vote Friday against the

obtained.
</P>
<P>
International Herald Tribune:
</P>
<P>
-- With the Senate in the final hours of deliberation over the
impeachment of President Bill Clinton, a House prosecutor harshly
criticized Mr. Clinton on Thursday over a report that the
president, angered by the impeachment trial, planned to focus on
his Republican foes for defeat in 2000 congressional elections.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Economic Growth Up in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot economic growth rate
in 1998 rose by 5 percent, compare with 2.5 percent in 1997, the
Cyprus Weekly reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The latest report issued by Cyprus' Statistics Department said
that the Cyprus economy continued its revival in 1998, fostered
mainly by the boom of tourism.
</P>
<P>
Tourist arrivals in Cyprus reached 2.1 million in 1998, an
increase of 6.8 percent from 1997, which earned the country 843
million Cyprus pounds (1,686 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
As a result of the pickup of economic activity, demand for
labor showed a recovery. At the end of October 1998, the
unemployment rate dropped to 3.2 percent of the economically
active population.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate, as measured by the consumer price index,
also fell to 2.2 percent in 1998, compared to 3.6 percent in 1997,
thanks to a much lower growth in the prices of local products and
electricity, and a minor increase in rents.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Doctors Discover New Hereditary Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus Institute of
Neurology and Genetics (CING) has discovered a new hereditary
neurological disorder in Jordan, which can cause paralysis of
legs, the Cyprus Weekly reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The new disease was named "Jerash Hereditary Motor Neuropathy"
after the mountainous region in Jordan, where it is prevalent in a
number of isolated villages, Lefcos Middleton, director of the
CING said Thursday at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Middleton said the research, carried out in collaboration with
the University Hospital and the King Hussein Hospital in Amman,
found 40 percent of the screened 120 people last year in three
Jerash villages suffering the disease.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the disorder causes lower limb paralysis to
children of 3-5 years old and the paralysis spreads upwards as
they grow older.
</P>
<P>
The disorder is prevalent in small mid-eastern communities in
Jordan, where close relatives, including first cousins, tend to
marry, he said.
</P>
<P>
CING geneticist Roulla Christodoulou confirmed the gene for
this disease was mapped on chromosome 9.
</P>
<P>
He said when both parents are carriers of the gene, there is a
25 percent chance for their offspring to develop the disease, a 25
percent chance of normality and a 50 percent chance become a
carrier.

</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):

</P>
<P>
Ecevit is expected to raise the proposals during the visit of

did not give further details about the proposals.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>

had assured him of deterring a meeting of the so-called "Kurdish
parliament in exile" in Spain.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Croatia Willing to Boost Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Croatia have
expressed that there are a large number of opportunities for
boosting bilateral cooperation, particularly in economy, defense
industry and investment.
</P>
<P>
Five agreements in cooperation in justice, science, technology,
customs services, agriculture and veterinary services have been
signed during the visit here by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman,
who left Turkey Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day visit, Tudjman and his Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel also exchanged views on a number of regional and
international issues, voicing concerns over the turbulent
situation in Kosovo and hoping the 1995 Dayton Peace Accord, which
ended the war in Bosnia, will be fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
Tensions in Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia, have heightened
since last February when bloody clashes erupted between Serbian
police and ethnic Albanians, who, comprising 90 percent of the
Kosovo population, demand independence from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
At a gathering of the Turkish - Croatian Business Council in
Ankara, Demirel has stressed that the present bilateral trade did
not reflect the genuine potential of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, trade volume between the two countries reached about
35 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Demirel pointed out that "our target in bilateral trade is 100
million dollars in the short term and 500 million dollars in the
long term."
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Turkey wishes to take an active part in
infrastructure projects in Croatia and Turkish contractors are
particularly interested in the construction of highways in
Croatia.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Marginally Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar
finished marginally up Friday, after failing to sustain an
overnight rally above the 65 U.S. cent mark as commodity prices
sank to historic lows.
</P>
<P>
European buying Thursday night propelled the Australian unit to
65.08 U.S. cents but a 21-year low in a leading commodities index
saw the domestic currency sold off gradually throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
At the close of trading the domestic unit was at 64.63 U.S.
cents from 64.53 Thursday, after spending the day between 64.52
and 64.78.
</P>
<P>
MMS Standard &AMP; Poor's said the Commodity Research Bureau Index
fell to a new 21-year low Thursday night, closing down 1.21 at
187.16 after hitting a low of 186.99.
</P>
<P>
"That probably hasn't helped the Aussie's prospects," Colonial
State Bank treasury manager Nick Volanakis said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Japanese currency also weakened briefly during the
day before recovering the ground, which could have impacted
negatively on the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
Japanese interest was focused on a meeting of the Bank of Japan
and speculation of an easing in monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
At the trading close, the local currency was buying 0.5753 euro
from 0.5700 and it was trading at 73.74 from 73.65 against
Japanese yen.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Minister Calls for Fight Against Graft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIR0BI, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Finance Minister Simon
Nyachae has asked all Kenyans to join in the fight against
corruption so as to improve governance and hasten economic growth
of the country.
</P>
<P>
"The government alone cannot eradicate corrupting, not even the
recently strengthened Anti-Corruption Authority can do it unless
the whole society participates," Nyachae said here Thursday at the
opening of the 7th annual economic symposium of the Institute of
Certified Public Accountants.
</P>
<P>
The campaign to eradicate corruption must be carried out at all
levels, the East African Standard newspaper Friday quoted Nyachae
as reporting.
</P>
<P>
The minister cautioned the country's accountants and auditors
against colluding with some road contractors to fleece the
government of millions of Shillings.
</P>
<P>
The minister decried the poor state of the country's roads,
telecommunications, water and port facilities.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government was spending heavily on road
repairs yet contractors only did shoddy jobs while accountants and
auditors were failing Kenyans by not telling how their hard earned
money was being spent.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government is taking measures to improve
efficiency in utilization of the funds allocated to
infrastructures. The general public must assume the role of
watchdog and insist on quality, he added.

</P>
<P>
Speaking during an exclusive Friday interview with Xinhua News
Agency, MOFTEC officials said China will introduce special
policies to encourage companies in the machinery and electronics,

Such companies will be encouraged to establish overseas
ventures to assemble and manufacture products such as automobiles,
motorcycles, small farm machinery and equipment, television sets,
refrigerators, washing machines and electric fans.
</P>
<P>
The policies will be in line with MOFTEC's export targets
announced earlier this month by Minister Shi Guangsheng. Shi said
MOFTEC will strengthen efforts to promote overseas processing with
domestically manufactured materials in order increase exports of
Chinese products, equipment, raw materials, parts and labor
services.
</P>
<P>
The minister described the policies as a major step of
restructuring the national economy and boosting China's exports in
1999. He added that the policies will be carried out on the basis

advanced operating mechanisms, experience with overseas businesses
and exports, as well as high creditability.
</P>
<P>
China will select 120 large enterprises and 1,000 key
enterprises to undertake pilot investments abroad in the form of

</P>
<P>
Chinese companies had established over 5,600 projects in more

America, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, by the end of 1998.
Related projects involved total investments of over nine billion
US dollars, with contracted investments from Chinese partners
amounting to 6.33 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The wide-ranging projects cover resources development,
processing and assembly, transportation, engineering construction,
pharmaceuticals, tourism and consulting services, in addition to
other areas common to the trade sector.
</P>
<P>
Sun Weiyan, president of the University of the International
Business and Economics, said overseas investments will benefit
both China and recipient areas.
</P>
<P>
"Investments will help increase exports of Chinese equipment,
technology, raw materials, semi-finished products and parts, in
addition to raising employment rates in areas attracting
investment, helping to restructure local economies, upgrading
technological levels and multiplying market supply," said Sun.

<HEADLINE> China Reports Rising Tax Revenues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- China's January tax revenues
reached 81.84 billion yuan, up 26.6 percent from the same month n
1998.
</P>
<P>
The figure accounted for 8.7 percent of the projected 1999 tax
revenues, according to a report released today by the State
Administration of Taxation.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the upward momentum to the stable
domestic economic performance and expanded revenue sources, as
well as the consistent efforts of taxation departments nationwide
to tighten controls over tax collection.
</P>
<P>
Most tax items, including value-added, consumption, enterprise
and personal income taxes, grew by an average 30 percent, with
various items approaching 100 percent growth, according to the
report. It also pointed out that tax revenues for major industries,
including tobacco petroleum, liquor, textile and coal sectors,
grew by over 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
China collected industrial and commercial tax revenues totaling
855.2 billion yuan in 1998, with this year's target set at 946
billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan MPs Reject Probe Into Military Purchase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan Parliament has
rejected a motion seeking to set up a select committee to probe
abuse of power and corruption in military procurement.
</P>
<P>
The motion, tabled by Aggrey Awori who is known for sounding a
different note in the legislature, attracted enormous opposition
Thursday, the New Vision daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
A number of MPs said that the suggested probe will expose the
country's military might or weakness.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan State Minister of Defense, Steven Kavuma said Thursday
that the select committee is not necessary because the
parliamentary committee handling defense affairs intends to
investigate this matter.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the motion, which seeks a thorough probe into
the purchase of helicopter,gun ships, tanks, radar and missiles,
could throw the country into a catastrophe if not stopped.
</P>
<P>
However, Awori said a report shows that some officers received
a commission on the purchase of the helicopters and the
parliament, as a watchdog of the government, should not be tired
of setting up another select committee.
</P>
<P>
It is entitled to know how public funds have been spent and
national security maintained, he added.
</P>
<P>
Some MPs have accused the army of paying inflated prices for
defective helicopters and tanks, saying that the officers
responsible for that purchase got huge sums of commission in the
process.

<HEADLINE> World Champion Xiong Ni To Stage Comeback at World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Olympic champion Xiong Ni will
come out of his retirement since 1997, choosing three World Cup
diving grand prixs in May to test his strength before the 2000
Sydney Olympics, an official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Jihong, chief of the national diving team, said that the
three-time Olympian has resumed his training in February and will
attend the three FINA-sponsored events held in Canada, the United
States and Mexico which traditionally featured a strong field.
</P>
<P>
Xiong Ni, 25, had put his retirment on his agenda after his
dream of Olympic champion finally came true in the 1996 Games,
becoming the first Chinese to win a men's springboard gold medal
at the Games.
</P>
<P>
The official announcement came when he collected the title of
three-meter springboard in the Eighth National Games in October
1997.
</P>
<P>
Since his departure, the traditional diving powerhouse has been
hit by a series of setbacks on international arena, chiefly
bowing to the challenge from the arch-rival Dimitry Sautin of
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the slump of international performance
partly to the premature retirement of some well-known athletes
like Xiong Ni.
</P>
<P>
Amid the calling for his comeback, the world champion resumed
training in May, 1998, vowing to produce impressive performance in
the Sydney Games if he gets selected.
</P>
<P>
But his aspiration was dumped by the failure to represent China
in the New Zealand World Cup Grand Prix in January, which cast
shadow over his possibility of presence in the turn-of-the-century
Games.
</P>
<P>
As concern arised that he might say goodbye to diving forever,
the world champion returned to the diving pool again after he had
been persuaded by the Chinese Swimming Sports Association (CSSA).
</P>
<P>
CSSA has hoped to beef up its strength in next year's Sydney
Olympics against a Russian line-up spearheaded by the seemingly
invincible great Dimitry Sautin, double titlist at the world
championships last year.

</P>
<P>
More than 160 people have been admitted with cholera to the

three mobile clinics have been set up to help fight the epidemic.
A huge consignment of antibiotics and intravenous fluids has been
sent to the area.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Israel Working to Link Arrow 2 to U.S. Radars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Israel
are seeking ways to share real-time information on missile defense
and to link the Arrow 2 anti-ballistic missile to U.S. radar
systems, a local daily said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are working to ensure that they can exchange
missile command and control information, a U.S. general, who was
here on a routine inspection of the Arrow 2 project, told the
Jerusalem Post Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Brig. General Daniel L. Montgomery, the program executive
officer for the U.S. Missile Defense Systems, said Israel and
the U.S. envision cooperation between Israel's Arrow 2 defense
systems and U.S. units in the region, which makes the exchange
of information very important.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries are also working closely to link
Arrow 2 with Patriot anti-ballistic missile systems, so that any
batteries deployed in the region would be able to share data.
</P>
<P>
Israel last year successfully conducted the first comprehensive
test launch of the Arrow 2 system, which is designed to shoot down
incoming missiles at speeds up to two miles per second traveling
10 or 25 miles above the earth's surface.
</P>
<P>
The Arrow, which costs 1.6 billion U.S. dollars and mostly
funded by the U.S., is expected to be fully operational in less
than a year after undergoing further testing.

<HEADLINE> Netherlands to Grant Angola $7M in Humanitarian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands has decided to
donate seven million U.S. Dollars in humanitarian aid to help the
Angolan people affected by escalating conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Dutch ambassador to Luanda, Jan Heric Berg said in Kuito,
capital of Bie Province, Thursday that the funds will be used in
humanitarian programs implemented by the United Nations
institutions, charity groups and non- governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
The Journal de Angola newspaper Friday quoted the ambassador
as saying that the Dutch government will give priority to the
programs of the International Committee of the Red Cross,
including rescuing the civilians wounded in the conflicts between
the Angolan government troops and the rebel UNITA forces.
</P>
<P>
Emergency aid for the war-created refugees is also among the
priorities of the humanitarian programs.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch ambassador said that in order to relieve the
suffering of the Angolan people, the Netherlands has offered
humanitarian assistance worth five million Dollars in the past
three years.
</P>
<P>
There are some 40,000 refugees in central Kuito city where Berg
was paying a visit. The battles between the government troops and
the forces of Jonas Savimbi's National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) around the city had been the most
fiercing ones since civil war broke out once again in the southern
African country last December.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Police Arrest Ex-Rwandan Minister in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan police have arrested a
former Rwandan minister indicted by a United Nations tribunal for
his alleged role in the 1994 genocide of an estimated 500,000
people, a tribunal spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard newspaper Friday quoted the
spokesman, Kingsley Moghalu, as saying that former Rwandan
information minister Eliezer Niyitegeka was arrested at his home
in suburban Nairobi on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
He was tracked down by prosecutors of the U.N. International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) based in the northern
Tanzanian town of Arusha, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors accuse Niyitegeka of leading massacres against
ethnic Tutsi hiding in the hills of western Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR spokesman said that "the Kenyan police at our request
arrested Niyitegeka. We are in the process of transferring him to
Arusha."
</P>
<P>
The ICTR was set up to bring the genocide's main architects to
justice. So far, its court has convicted three men, sentencing
two to its maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a third to 15
years in jail.
</P>
<P>
Niyitegeka was the 11th genocide suspect to have been arrested
in Kenya, where many prominent Hutus fled after the massacres.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Fireworks Ban Lifted Northern Chinese City Lifts Ban on Fireworks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Shijiazhuang, capital of north
China's Hebei Province, will lift the five-year ban on fireworks
during the Spring Festival, the Chinese Lunar New Year, which
falls on February 16 this year, the "China Youth News" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
However, the time and places for the fireworks displays will be
limited. People will not be allowed to set off firecrackers at
hospitals, train and bus stations, museums, libraries, markets,
busy shopping streets, government institutions, gas stations, and
warehouses.
</P>
<P>
Only small and low-altitude fireworks are allowed to be sold,
and the municipal supply and marketing cooperatives have been
designated as the sole sellers. Individuals and privately owned
shops, which used to produce low-quality firecrackers, are
prohibited from selling these products.
</P>
<P>
Fireworks were banned in Shijiazhuang on December 1, 1994 after
the city's People's Congress approved a regulation prohibiting
fireworks in urban districts. The ban was lifted after a survey
among the local people.
</P>
<P>
Ten other cities in Hebei are divided on whether or not to lift
the ban. Those favoring the ban say it will help keep the
environment clean, reduce noise, and prevent fires and injuries.
Those against the ban say fireworks displays help create a festive
atmosphere.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese President Visits Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile
Lahoud left here on Friday for Damascus on a one-day
official visit to Syria, his first tour abroad since he took
office last November.
</P>
<P>
The Voice of People radio quoted presidential palace sources
as saying the president will hold talks with his Syrian
counterpart Hafez Assad and other senior officials on bilateral
ties and peace process in the region.
</P>
<P>
Their talks will also focus on the situation in south
Lebanon where Israeli occupation forces and Lebanese guerrillas
exchange fire almost everyday.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north
from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting
to oust Israelis and its allies the South Lebanon Army out of
the country.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two countries' leaders will reaffirm
the entwinement of Lebanese and Syrian tracks in the peace
talks with Israel, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Israel is occupying Syrian Golan Heights it captured in the
1967 Middle East War. Its negotiations to return the strategic
plateau with Syria was suspended in 1996 when Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to power.
</P>
<P>
In April last year, the Jewish state offered to withdraw
from south Lebanon provided security arrangements are reached
with the Beirut government beforehand.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its ally Syria, which has 35,000 troops in
Lebanon, rejected the offer, asking Israel to leave the
country without any conditions.
</P>
<P>
Israel accused Syria of holding south Lebanon as a
bargaining chip to seek a full Israeli withdrawal which will
also include Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud, former army commander, was elected as Lebanon's 11th
president after allegedly enjoying both the approval of Assad
and Lebanese popular support.

WELLINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The resident population of

of
22,600 or 0.6 percent over the 1997 figure, Statistics New Zealand

The 0.6 growth rate is less than half the 1.4 percent average

Permanent and long-term departures exceeded arrivals by 6,300
last
year, compared with a net migration gain of 7,600 in 1997. The

<HEADLINE> Chinese Academy of Sciences "Reinvents" Institutes as Part of Well-Funded Reform (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide project aimed at
restructuring research institutes, universities and enterprises
has been launched with the approval of a Ministry of Finance grant
of 5.4 billion yuan over the next three years to the Chinese
Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The reorganization of the academy by the State Council, known
as the CAS Knowledge Innovation Program, will act as a pilot which,
if successful, will later be extended across the country.
</P>
<P>
The large amount of money is unprecedented and is on top of
annual administrative fees, or head count fees, that the CAS will
continue to receive, and will be distributed over a three year
period.
</P>
<P>
"On the one hand, we need the money badly to carry out in-depth
structural reform; on the other hand, there is also a great amount
of pressure on us because we cannot use a lack of money as an
excuse if we fail to come up with tangible results," says CAS vice
president Yan Yixun, who describes the CAS innovation program as "
an unprecedented opportunity as well as a great challenge" for the
academy.
</P>
<P>
While 600 million of the 5.4 billion is being earmarked for
supporting those coming to work at CAS from abroad, most will be
used to cover the costs of the more radical reform measures needed
within CAS. It plans to reduce its research institutes by one
third in number and retain only 30,000 fixed positions out of the
current 68,000 by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Those given fixed-contracts, which involves better working
conditions, will enjoy more research funds, but some 30,000 of the
current army of CAS employees will lose their once-permanent
positions and will have to look for temporary appointments either
inside or outside CAS, or re-train.
</P>
<P>
Making arrangements for those laid-off will take up part of the
funding, according to CAS spokesman Li Yunling.
</P>
<P>
She says the aim of the CAS Knowledge Innovation Program is to
establish a modern scientific research system within the academy
that is in accordance with international practice.

JERUSALEM, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States and Israel are working out ways to share
real-time information on missile defense and link the Arrow 2
anti-ballistic missile to U.S. radar systems, a U.S. general said
Thursday. He said the two countries are also working closely to
link Arrow 2 with Patriot anti-ballistic missile systems, so that
any batteries deployed in the region would be able to share data.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The security establishment has received very serious
warnings about the intention of terrorist organizations, especially
Hamas, to kidnap Israeli soldiers to use as bargaining chips.
Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz disclosed Thursday that in the past
month two attempts to kidnap soldiers were foiled.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Efforts are under way to prevent ultra-Orthodox from
staging a planned mass demonstration Sunday against the judicial
system. Dozens of non-Orthodox organizations are also planning
counter-demonstrations.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Academy of Sciences "Reinvents" Institutes as Part of Well-Funded Reform (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the sole exception of the Dalian Chemical Physics
Institute, most projects are in the initial stage of discussing
details for restructuring plans, or are awaiting the green light
from the CAS to proceed with detailed plan. Despite lingering
difficulties concerning the division of practical reorganization,
many believe that measures will be carried out to alleviate the
welfare burden on the academy's institutes.
</P>
<P>
Companies, totally separate from the institutes, will be set up
to provide services such as transportation, while an office will
be set up to handle Communist Party affairs, issues involving
trade union membership, family planning work, and daily business
other than research.
</P>
<P>
Institutes will proceed in line with national housing and
medical reforms, and will no longer provide apartments or medical
care for employees. However, a measure of assistance will still be
provided in the form of housing subsidies and medical insurance
partially funded with employee contributions.
</P>
<P>
Deng Maicun, the 39-year-old director of the Dalian Chemical
Physics Institute, expressed hope that a decision will be reached
sooner rather than later. He said that permitting the
establishment of a true board will enable the institute to attract
outside investment and build true partnerships with investors.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that the CAS is currently the sole investor
in the institute and thus the establishment of a board is out of
the question.
</P>
<P>
Laboratory heads, including the institute director, will be
reelected every four years, and individuals holding fixed
positions will be awarded two-year contracts. Laboratory heads
holding a position for two successive terms will become permanent
CAS researchers.
</P>
<P>
Various application restrictions, including age, are currently
in force. Yi Baolian, a researcher at the institute and member of
the selection committee, said individuals over 56 years of age
will be ineligible for positions as laboratory heads. He noted
that youth prevails, and pointed out that eight of the 10 new
laboratory heads are under 40.
</P>
<P>
The eventual success of the CAS Knowledge Innovation Program,
or lack thereof, will determine if related experiences are
extended to research sections in universities and enterprises.
However, Yi pointed out that it is "still much too early " to tell
whether or not this task can be mastered.

<P>
JERUSALEM, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Shaul Mofaz, Chief of
General Staff of Israeli military, has warned that the Islamic
militant group Hamas is stepping up its attempts to kidnap
Israeli soldiers, local daily The Jerusalem Post reported on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Mofaz as saying that Hamas wanted to use
kidnaped Israeli soldiers as a bargaining chip in the
negotiations for the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli
jails.
</P>
<P>
Mofaz noted that Hamas activists have tried to kidnap Israeli
soldiers at least twice in the past month and in one case, the
army "paid a price" to foil the attempt.
</P>
<P>
It is assumed that Mofaz was referring to the killing of an
Israeli soldier near the West Bank city of Hebron last month
during a clash with Hamas members.
</P>
<P>
"I want to tell you that to the best of my understanding these
attempts will continue," Mofaz said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "this war against terror and violence has a
price, and sometimes we pay for it."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli army has issued strict warnings to soldiers
that Hamas members are actively trying kidnap them.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers also have been told to abide strictly by regulations
on hitchhiking. Officers have been instructed to review the
regulations with their troops, and military policemen are out in
force to make sure soldiers are obeying them.

his hope that Poland would support his country's efforts to join
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Polish news
agency reported. He said it was necessary for the two countries to
strengthen cooperation to ensure a speedy integration with the EU
since the two were among the first group of countries permitted to
enter. (Poland-Slovenia)

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide project aimed at
restructuring research institutes, universities and enterprises
has been launched with the approval of a Ministry of Finance grant
of 5.4 billion yuan over the next three years to the Chinese
Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The reorganization of the academy by the State Council, known
as the CAS Knowledge Innovation Program, will act as a pilot which,
if successful, will later be extended across the country.
</P>
<P>
The large amount of money is unprecedented and is on top of
annual administrative fees, or head count fees, that the CAS will
continue to receive, and will be distributed over a three year
period.
</P>
<P>
"On the one hand, we need the money badly to carry out in-depth
structural reform; on the other hand, there is also a great amount
of pressure on us because we cannot use a lack of money as an
excuse if we fail to come up with tangible results," says CAS vice
president Yan Yixun, who describes the CAS innovation program as "
an unprecedented opportunity as well as a great challenge" for the
academy.
</P>
<P>
While 600 million of the 5.4 billion is being earmarked for
supporting those coming to work at CAS from abroad, most will be
used to cover the costs of the more radical reform measures needed
within CAS. It plans to reduce its research institutes by one
third in number and retain only 30,000 fixed positions out of the
current 68,000 by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Those given fixed-contracts, which involves better working
conditions, will enjoy more research funds, but some 30,000 of the
current army of CAS employees will lose their once-permanent
positions and will have to look for temporary appointments either
inside or outside CAS, or re-train.
</P>
<P>
Making arrangements for those laid-off will take up part of the
funding, according to CAS spokesman Li Yunling.
</P>
<P>
She says the aim of the CAS Knowledge Innovation Program is to
establish a modern scientific research system within the academy
that is in accordance with international practice.

<TEXT>
<P>
With the sole exception of the Dalian Chemical Physics
Institute, most projects are in the initial stage of discussing
details for restructuring plans, or are awaiting the green light
from the CAS to proceed with detailed plan. Despite lingering
difficulties concerning the division of practical reorganization,
many believe that measures will be carried out to alleviate the
welfare burden on the academy's institutes.
</P>
<P>
Companies, totally separate from the institutes, will be set up
to provide services such as transportation, while an office will
be set up to handle Communist Party affairs, issues involving
trade union membership, family planning work, and daily business
other than research.
</P>
<P>
Institutes will proceed in line with national housing and
medical reforms, and will no longer provide apartments or medical
care for employees. However, a measure of assistance will still be
provided in the form of housing subsidies and medical insurance
partially funded with employee contributions.
</P>
<P>
Deng Maicun, the 39-year-old director of the Dalian Chemical
Physics Institute, expressed hope that a decision will be reached
sooner rather than later. He said that permitting the
establishment of a true board will enable the institute to attract
outside investment and build true partnerships with investors.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that the CAS is currently the sole investor
in the institute and thus the establishment of a board is out of
the question.
</P>
<P>
Laboratory heads, including the institute director, will be
reelected every four years, and individuals holding fixed
positions will be awarded two-year contracts. Laboratory heads
holding a position for two successive terms will become permanent
CAS researchers.
</P>
<P>
Various application restrictions, including age, are currently
in force. Yi Baolian, a researcher at the institute and member of
the selection committee, said individuals over 56 years of age
will be ineligible for positions as laboratory heads. He noted
that youth prevails, and pointed out that eight of the 10 new
laboratory heads are under 40.
</P>
<P>
The eventual success of the CAS Knowledge Innovation Program,
or lack thereof, will determine if related experiences are
extended to research sections in universities and enterprises.
However, Yi pointed out that it is "still much too early " to tell
whether or not this task can be mastered.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Ivory Trade Helpful for Elephant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 12 (Xinhua) -- British Environment Minister
Michael Meacher has said that the move to permit Zimbabwe and
Namibia to trade ivory with Japan on an experimental basis will
help the two countries generate revenue for elephant conservation.
</P>
<P>
"The funds raised from these ivory sales will be directed back
into elephant conservation where populations are flourishing, as
well as helping local communities living alongside the elephants,"
Meacher said in a statement released by the British High
Commission in Harare Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Elephant conservation and anti-poaching measures are expensive,
Meacher added.
</P>
<P>
The decision to allow the two African countries to engage in
experimental ivory trade was reached at a meeting of the Standing
Committee of the Convention on the International Trade in
Endangered Species (CITES) in Geneva Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A one-off experimental shipment of stock-piled ivory to Japan
from Namibia and Zimbabwe was permitted after United Nations
Environment Program (UNEP) identified that strict conservation
measures in both countries had been met.
</P>
<P>
The ivory contained in this shipment cannot be re-exported
outside Japan.
</P>
<P>
The standing committee also endorsed new measures which will
provide a comprehensive elephant monitoring system covering all of
Africa and southern Asia, Zimbabwe's Herald newspaper Friday
quoted Meacher as reporting.
</P>
<P>
The measures will include ETIS (Elephant Trade Information
System) to be funded by the United Kingdom for a year to monitor
both legal and illegal trading in ivory, and MIKE, a new elephant
population monitoring system which will involve the tracking of
elephant populations in range states across Africa and South Asia.
</P>
<P>
The European Union, United States and Japan pledged substantial
funding to get the system up and running.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Trade Unions to Pressure Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Unions (ZCTU) has resolved to put consumer boycotts on its agenda,
in attempts to resist relentless price increases, the Herald daily
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The boycotts are among the three resolutions adopted by the
national labor organization's general council at an extraordinary
meeting held here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It seems that the resolution by the organization's highest
decision-making body is part of its latest weapon to pressure the
government and industrialists into reversing the price increases,
following a ban on job mass stayaways by the government last year.
</P>
<P>
The stayaways were threatening to cripple the economy.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at the end of the extraordinary meeting,
ZCTU Secretary-General Morgan Tsvangirai said the organization
will be going back to its structures to update workers on the
on-going tripartite meetings, and ponder the next move.
</P>
<P>
"The general council concluded that the government's sincerity
to take specific measures to arrest the current economic crisis is
questionable," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The government continues to dither on crucial matters to
address the escalating rate of inflation, the severe national
debt, the day-to-day increases in the prices of basic commodities,
devaluation of the local currency, etc., whereby the talks have
become inconclusive," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Declares 18-Month Ban on New Roads in Forests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. authorities on
Thursday declared an 18-month ban on building roads in national
forests, mainly in the west coast states.
</P>
<P>
"This interim policy will allow us to protect socially
important and ecologically valuable roadless areas while we
develop a protective and responsible long-term road policy," said
Mike Dombeck, chief of Forest Service at the U.S. Agriculture
Department.
</P>
<P>
The new rule puts a temporary end to a year-long debate over
the forests. U.S. President Bill Clinton said in late 1997 that a
more environmentally-friendly approach would be taken toward road-
building in the 191 million-acre public forest system in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Environmental groups said the moratorium still left some 15
million acres of roadless national forest land unprotected from
building due to exemptions, including wholesale exclusions for
forests in Alaska, California and the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
"I assume he (Dombeck) knows we need to go farther than just a
new road policy to protect these last remaining roadless acres,"
said William Meadows, president of the Wilderness Society.

<HEADLINE> Private Car Owners on Rise in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Over 45 percent of the motor
vehicles sold in 1998 in China went to private buyers and farmers
accounted for the largest proportion.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China turned out 1.62 million motor vehicles,
including over 500,000 cars, putting the number of private vehicle
owners at 12 million.
</P>
<P>
The private car market is demonstrating huge potential, as the
bank savings in the country hit 5.34 trillion yuan (643.37 billion
U.S. dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey shows that 70 percent of the families in
Guangzhou, Beijing, and Shanghai intent to buy cars within the
next five to ten years. In 1998, individual buyers accounted for
89 percent of the cars sold by two major car dealers in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The rapid construction of expressways has also enlarged the
passenger transportation market, along with advances in vehicle-
production technology. At the same time, increasing rural demand
has promoted the upgrading of light-duty and mini vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The automobile industry as a whole is becoming stronger by
constantly expanding production scale. During the Ninth Five-Year-
Plan period (1996-2000), state investment in the country's large
auto-manufacturing groups is expected to reach as high as 91
percent of all investment in this sector.
</P>
<P>
At present, the nation's 13 leading car manufacturers account
for 92 percent of China's total motor-vehicle output.

<HEADLINE> Australia Committed to Skilled Migration Intake: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Australian federal
government Friday said it was committed to promoting the intake of
skilled migrants to Australia and boosting their English language
skills.
</P>
<P>
Australian Federal Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock said
Australia had a larger skilled migration program in a smaller
migration program overall last financial year than for the
previous financial year.
</P>
<P>
The total number of migrants entering Australia in the
financial year of 1997-1998, which ended on June 30, 1998, was
77,327, a fall of nearly 10 percent on the previous year,
according to Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Department
figures.
</P>
<P>
But the number of skilled migrants to Australia hit 25,985 in
1997-1998, an increase of just over 30 percent from 19,697 the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who was attending an Adult Migrant English
Program (AMEP) conference in Melbourne, said that since the launch
of AMEP in 1948, teaching English to migrants had become a
government priority to bind the nation together.
</P>
<P>
"In a country like Australia, which conducts an immigration
program which is so culturally diverse and people come from almost
170 different countries, if you didn't have English how would you
communicate?" he told the Australian Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
"If people are going to be able to have an opportunity to
participate fully, to use the skills that they've got, if they're
going to be able to use them beneficially, for themselves as well
as the nation, they need to be able to communicate effectively,"
he said.

YANGON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar Foreign Minister U Win
Aung will pay official visits to Brunei, Indonesia, Singapore and
Thailand, member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN), in the near future, according to an official
announcement here Friday.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of his counterparts of the four countries, U
Win Aung is to pay the visit, the announcement said without
disclosing the date.
</P>
<P>
It will be U Win Aung's first official visits to other ASEAN
member countries since he became foreign minister in a latest
reshuffle of the cabinet in November last year replacing U Ohn
Gyaw.
</P>
<P>
He said in a recent meeting with the diplomatic corps in
Myanmar that the country will continue to pursue an independent
and active foreign policy, maintaining friendly and cordial
relations with all countries particularly with its neighbors as
well as countries in the region through frequent exchange of
visits.
</P>
<P>
The relation between Myanmar and the ASEAN have been developing
after the country's integration into the grouping in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
Exchange of visits by state leaders of Myanmar and other ASEAN
member nations since then has promoted the development of their
bilateral ties.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 12 (Xinhua) -- 47 Indian industries had
registered lower growth rate in the first nine months of the
current fiscal year 1998-99 (April 1, 1998-March 31, 1999),
official sources said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, the figures-calculated on the basis of
information provided by Associations Council of the Confederation
of Indian Industry (CII) members and 77 affiliated bodies, which
account for over 65 percent of the total output in most cases, do
not support the official stance: an industrial revival is in the
offing.
</P>
<P>
The trend worsened gradually during the period under review.
The April-September figures showed 39 sectors in the positive,
while the number came down to 37 in April-October. In
April-December, 47 sectors posted lower growth rate against the
corresponding period of 1997 and only 29 showed improvement and
four remained stagnant, CII sources said.
</P>
<P>
Among consumer durables, refrigerators registered a decline of
11-15 percent, air-conditioners 13-20 percent and washing machines
10-20 percent. Color television, which had been one of the star
performers in recent times, registered a decline of 20-22 percent.
</P>
<P>
Among other crucial sectors, there was continued decline in
cement (4.5-9.5 percent), steel (-0.6- -2.2 percent), machine
tools (-8.9- -27 percent) polyester filament yarn (17-26 percent),
etc.

And more than 300,000 Chinese people have traveled overseas for
further studies and work exchanges in the same period, 80,000 in
the last two years, according to the State Administration of
Foreign Experts Affairs (SAFEA).
</P>
<P>
Wan Xueyuan, director of SAFEA, revealed that increasing
numbers of foreign professionals are working in a wide range of
disciplines including, academia, science, construction, energy and
even in archeological fields.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese local governments at all levels have been benefited
from the introduction of overseas talent and they are getting more
enthusiastic about it," Wan said.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, there have been over 120 major
technical and industrial projects completed with the help of
foreign experts. Within the agricultural sector more than 270
breeding programs and seed planting projects have been realized
and foreign experts have been working in such diverse areas as
general agriculture, forestry, livestock breeding, fish farming
and on more than 30 advanced techniques for cultivation, soil
improvement and irrigation.

<TEXT>
<P>
Wan gave two examples of the successful importation of foreign
talent:
</P>
<P>
A nonferrous metal refinery plant in northwest China's Ningxia
Hui Autonomous Region invited more than 30 relevant experts from
the United States, Russia, Japan and Germany to work alongside its
own professionals and as a result has completed 15 important
research projects. Now the plant's products have a ready market in
more than 10 countries and regions, making an annual profit of 28
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
 The SAFEA and the Chinese Ministry of Water Conservancy last
year invited six U.S. experts to investigate China's flood-hit
areas and later sent a 26-member delegation to the U.S. for a
month-long exchanges and training in flood control. The delegation
put forward "valuable suggestions" for China's future flood
control, which was appreciated by top Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
And a number of livestock breeds and seed plantings from Canada,
the U.S., Russia, Japan and other countries are becoming popular
in various areas of China, with noticeable results, Wan said.
</P>
<P>
Yet Wan is not satisfied with certain problems in the use of
foreign skills and techniques. He points out that there has been
slow progress in boosting and improving China's service and
information sectors and expressed concern about the repeated and
continual introduction in some areas of out-moded foreign
expertise and technical skills.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the SAFEA will focus its attentions on
planting, water conservancy and irrigation projects, the
restructuring and modern management of state-owned enterprises,
the building of new and hi-tech areas, and obviously the country's
key development and infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
Wan said that he believes that there is much potential in the
use of overseas skills which can be tapped in the years to come.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Set Up National Railway Museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka is soon to establish
a national railway museum to exhibit monuments of the Railway
Department during its 135-year history, the official Daily News
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The museum is to be set up at a 75-year-old building complex at
Ratmalana, southern suburb of the capital Colombo, which formerly
served as the Railway Officers Welfare Club, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The National Railway Museum Steering Committee (NRMSC) expects
to complete the museum stage by stage and to open it for the
public within this year.
</P>
<P>
The exhibits will include steam locomotives, diesel engines,
old coaches and an assortment of railway articles such as
whistles, uniforms and lanterns, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The NRMSC hopes to start joint programs with the Department of
Education and the Ministry of Tourism to attract school children,
students and tourists as the museum will be an effective medium of
education and interactive entertainment.
</P>
<P>
Funds needed to restore the museum exhibits will be raised from
the private sector while some items have already been restored by
apprentices of the German Technical Training Institute at
Ratmalana.
</P>
<P>
The museum will also have an auditorium and audio visual aides,
a library, a landscaped garden and working scale models in a
scenic setting.
</P>
<P>
Simulations on computer screens of signals and railways
enabling a hand-on demonstration of the railway system will also
be part of the museum, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Scientists: Geothermal Effects May Result in Ozone Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists believed
that the destruction of ozone layers in the Antarctic and other
regions may have resulted partly from a geothermal effect produced
by large mountain ranges.
</P>
<P>
Recent studies indicated that the ozone-depletion phenomenon
has been detected over the 4,000-meter-high Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
It has also been observed over the Rocky Mountain in South
American.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily reported that ozone depletion has aroused
public concern as the ozone layer is essential for protecting the
earth from solar ultra-violet radiation and because it is closely
related to climate and ecosystem changes.
</P>
<P>
Zou Han, a researcher from the Institute of Atmospheric Physics
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences said, studies showed that the
chemical pollution is a major factor causing the destruction of
ozone layers. However, those studies have not elaborated the
specific processes that causes destruction of ozone layers.
</P>
<P>
He said Chinese scientists recently found that the global
distribution and zonal deviation of total ozone show apparent low
ozone distributions overt the three major mountainous regions with
the strongest one over Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Zou said, a seasonal variation in the regional distribution of
ozone layers indicates there is a spring maximum and autumn
minimum of ozone over the three regions.
</P>
<P>
The regionwide measurement of zonal distribution indicated that
maximum local ozone deficits occur during the spring and early
summer over the mountainous regions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ozone is regarded as one of the green houses that scientists
believe modifies the strength of ultraviolet radiation reaching
the earth.
</P>
<P>
Zou and his colleagues believed that there is a region of low
ozone distribution over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau during the
summer.
</P>
<P>
The height of the plateau ranges from 3,000 to 5,000 meters
above sea level.
</P>
<P>
The relatively strong solar radiation and nature of the ground
surface makes the plateau a strong geothermal source for the
atmosphere.

<HEADLINE> Hungary to Issue 500 Million Euros Worth of Bonds Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Hungary will launch a sale of
bonds abroad this year in the amount of 500 million euros (590
million U.S. dollars) to reduce the increasingly adverse balance
of international payments.
</P>
<P>
The issue, signed by the Ministry of finance and the relevant
banks Thursday, will have a maturity of ten years and will carry
an interest rate of 4.375 percent a year, said the Hungarian news
agency MTI.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Hungary's international payments rapidly worsened with
its unfavorable balance of nearly 2.264 billion dollars or 1.3
times more than in 1997, while foreign investments introduced into
the country in the year could only make up for two-thirds of the
unfavorable balance.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the total amount of this imbalance will likely
continue to rise to 2.5-2.7 billion dollars, said the Hungarian
government, which has to repay a total of 1.9 billion dollars of
foreign debts within this year.
</P>
<P>
It will have been the first time for Hungary to issue euro
bonds. Hungarian Deputy Minister of Finance Thuma Jozhef did not
rule out the possibility that his country could issue more bonds
abroad in the years to come.

<HEADLINE> Mia Audina's Marriage Plan Sparks Family Feud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian female badminton
player Mia Audina's passage to the altar faces an early test from
her own father Rivan Tjiptawan, who worries that her beleaguered
career will instead hit a new low.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Mia will perform better after her marriage",
Rivan was quoted by the Jakarta Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"She's too young to marry. She should have focused her
attention more on the sport she has chosen as her way of life," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Mia, who will turn 20 in August, confirmed her plan to marry
her boyfriend Tylio Lobman later this year in a Netherlands church
at an unspecified date. She has insisted marriage would make her
life steady and help her improve her battered form.
</P>
<P>
She is completing her studies at the special athletes junior
high school in Ragunan, South Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Rivan said Mia should learn from Susi Susanti, who decided to
marry only after she collected major laurels, including an Olympic
gold medal.
</P>
<P>
"I wish Mia would rethink her plan. She still has a bright
future and talent to exploit," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mia has said her plan had received approval from the Badminton
Association of Indonesia chairman Subagyo Hadisiswoyo, but Rivan
said he knew nothing about Mia's would-be groom.
</P>
<P>
"I'm in the dark about his background," Rivan said of Lobman.
Rivan coached little Mia and served as her mentor off the court
for a number of years.
</P>
<P>
Mia said she had been in love with the Suriname-born singer
Lobman for one and a half years. Lobman has frequently been seen
accompanying Mia on her outings since they first met.
</P>
<P>
"I feel she has left me since she met her boyfriend," Rivan
complained.
</P>
<P>
When contacted by reporters, Susi said marriage would disrupt
an athlete's concentration. "That's why I decided to marry only
after I capped my badminton career," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Marriage gives an athlete additional responsibilities apart
from his or her daily workouts. The athlete will face double
pressures," said Susi, who is expecting a baby in two months.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Leader Calls for National Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader Senior General
Than Shwe Friday called for national unity to strive for
attainment of the union's goal for emergence of a peaceful, modern
and developed nation.
</P>
<P>
Than Shwe, chairman of the Myanmar State Peace and Development
Council, made the call in his message on the occasion of the
country's Union Day which falls on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Only when all the national people have firm national
convictions and concepts and practically implement them as
national policies, will all the nationals of the union smoothly
and straightly reach the aspired goal of the union," he said.
</P>
<P>
The national convictions and concepts are: non-disintegration
of the union, non-disintegration of national solidarity and
perpetuation of sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
He called for safeguarding the national policies of these
convictions and concepts.
</P>
<P>
He said that despite its rich natural resources, Myanmar has
lagged behind in development in the absence of stability and peace
in the country due to the armed insurrections which had broken out
since the regaining of independence because of the machinations
by the colonialists.
</P>
<P>
He urged all the national people to strive in unison and
cooperation to firmly build the new peaceful, modern and developed
nation to be able to pay the historical debt of such lagging in
development.
</P>
<P>
He added that the strength of the union was great and solid and
its prestige was high in the times when national unity was
dynamic, and the nation's political, economic and social
conditions declined in the periods when national unity was weak.
</P>
<P>
He further called for combination of the three strengths of the
union -- the national people, the government and the Tatmadaw
(armed forces) -- as the consolidated force of the union.
</P>
<P>
On February 12, 1947, Myanmar ethnic leaders met at the Panlong
Conference in Shan state, sponsored under the leadership of the
late Myanmar independence hero General Aung San, and signed the
Panlong Agreement to strive in unity for the country's
independence from the British colonial rule. Myanmar won
independence on January 4, 1948.

<HEADLINE> Bank of Thailand Revises Export Growth target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The central bank's Assistant Governor Kiettisak Meecharoen was
quoted Friday by The Nation as saying that the downward revision
of exports is due mainly to the slowdown in global economic
growth, primarily slower demand in the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Export prospects in the Asian markets have improved because
their economies have stabilized and shown signs of recovery. The
Chinese market, in particularly, remains strong and expanding at
an annual rate of 5 to 6 percent, Kiettisak said.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the Thai economy, Kiettisak said there are signs of
improvements in some key indicators. Sale of vehicles have climbed
since October last year while department stores and industrial
output also posted increases.
</P>
<P>
"Growth in the domestic economy should help offset a slowdown
in exports but the economy is still mired in uncertainty. The risk
factors are still out there. We believe that the economy should
expand after a contraction of 8.5 percent last year," Kiettisak
said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, Malaysia to Handle Forest Fires Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to prevent
devastating forest fires from breaking out in Indonesia this year,
Malaysia may provide assistance in the form of manpower, equipment
and technology.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Coordinating Minister of People's Welfare and
Poverty Eradication Haryono Suyono and visiting Malaysian
Information Minister Datuk Mohamad Rahmat Thursday reached a
"shoulder to shoulder" agreement on dealing with fires near the
two nations' border areas.
</P>
<P>
Forest fires in Indonesia caused a toxic smoke haze over much
of Southeast Asia in late 1997 and early 1998, and renewed fires
could sour relations between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with Suyono, the Malaysian minister said the
discussion was "very productive" and both nations now share a good
vision for the future.
</P>
<P>
Datuk said that to prevent fires, both nations should examine
their combined assets, including manpower and equipment.
</P>
<P>
"We want to help Indonesia. We are committed to making the
forests more safe. And we hope the forest fire calamities won't
happen again", Datuk was quoted by the Indonesian Observer Friday
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who coordinates efforts to overcome natural
disasters in Malaysia, said the fire issue will be seriously
addressed at a joint ministerial meeting in Kuala Lumpur in March.
</P>
<P>
Suyono expressed the hope that Indonesia would be able to
overcome any fires by using Malaysia's "early approach" system of
dealing with looming disasters.

<HEADLINE> 2 Senior Philippine Officials Probed on Bribery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Thursday that he will dismiss officials found to be
involved in a reported 75,000-U.S. dollar bribery attempt in
exchange for a deal with the government, the Journal newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada was quoted as saying that he is still waiting for the
result of an inquiry by the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI)
into the supposed "misdelivery" of a package containing 3 million
pesos (75,000 U.S. dollars) to a senior government official.
</P>
<P>
In a preliminary report to Estrada, NBI Director Santiago
Toledo said that a businesswoman handed a package to an official
of the Department of Budget and Management.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted the report as saying that the official was
asked to deliver the package to Budget and Management Secretary
Benjamin Diokno who found 3 million pesos inside the package.
</P>
<P>
The woman later returned to the office of the department and
demanded the return of the money which she said was "mistakenly
given," the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
According to the NBI report, the woman claimed in her sworn
affidavit that the money was intended to the government's Deputy
Executive Secretary Vicente de la Serna and his executive
assistant Ricardo Fulgencio.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the woman, Mary Ann Maslog, and a publishing
firm have a deal of 200 million pesos (5 million U.S. dollars)
with the Department of Education, Culture and Sports.
</P>
<P>
The woman said in her affidavit that de la Serna and Fulgencio
"manifested their intention to participate in the deal but the
latter gave way in favor of Maslog in exchange for the 3 million
pesos," the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
In his Memorandum to Estrada, de la Serna denied the
accusation, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The NBI is digging deeper into the actual participation of the
two officials and the alleged 200-million-peso deal, the newspaper
said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Rice Output Will Fall Short of Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian State Minister of
Food and Horticulture A.M. Saefuddin said that he feared the
country's unhusked rice production would not meet the set target
of 52 million tons this year because of a longer than expected
rainy season.
</P>
<P>
"The initial target was 52 million tons of unhusked rice or 31
million tons of milled rice. But heavy rains caused by the La Nina
weather phenomenon and the scarcity of fertilizers could cut the
output of unhusked rice to only 48 million tons or 29 million tons
of milled rice," he said.
</P>
<P>
With a production level of 48 million tons of unhusked rice,
Indonesia would need to import about 2.5 million tons of rice
during the next fiscal year, which will begin in April, he was
quoted by the Jakarta Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Rice consumption for the country's population of more than 200
million is expected to reach 33 million tons next year.
</P>
<P>
The drop in the domestic production of rice last year forced
the State Logistics Agency to import 4.6 million tons of rice
during the 1998/1999 fiscal year, a 780 percent increase over the
523,776 tons it imported during the 1997/1998 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Saefuddin also said that heavy rain and a lack of fertilizers
during the planting season resulted in low-quality rice.

<HEADLINE> Relocation Well Under Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- A massive relocation drive
involving more than 1 million residents at the Three Gorges
Reservoir Area is progressing smoothly, according to Guo Shuyan,
deputy director of the Three Gorges Project Construction
Commission under the State Council.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, 160,000 locals, about 19 percent of the 840,
000 residents to be resettled, had been moved to new areas, Today'
s China Daily quoted a report from the Three Gorges commission's
Resettlement Bureau as saying.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion of the gigantic program in 2009, over 1.3
million residents are to have been resettled, including residents
from the lake area, Hubei Province and Chongqing Municipality.
</P>
<P>
As part of the program, some 103,400 people were moved during
1993-97, at a cost of 8.575 billion yuan (1.04 billion U.S.
dollars), according to the resettlement bureau.
</P>
<P>
Houses and apartments, with a combined floor space of more than
4.14 million sq.m including urban and rural residents' workshops
have been rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
Damming the main course of the Yangtze in 1997 symbolized the
end of the first-phase of the relocation, a bureau official said,
noting that the second phase (1998-2003) will be more difficult
than the project's first phase.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a critical period in the program as it will decide
whether the Three Gorges project can start storing water and begin
generating electricity as scheduled," the official said.
</P>
<P>
As many as 550,000 people are to be relocated during the second
phase, with 110,000 residents resettled annually.
</P>
<P>
To help ensure the relocated people's means of living and
production, more than 15 million sq.m of housing floor space is
planned, along with the construction of 684 km of roads, about 2,
260 km of power transmission lines and 3,312 km of
telecommunications lines.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Favors Fast Solution on E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie Thursday said he wanted the issue of East Timor to be
resolved by the start of next year.
</P>
<P>
"From January 1, 2000, the East Timor question should be
resolved. We don't want to be burdened with the East Timor
problem. We will concentrate on other 26 provinces," Habibie told
the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry executives at the
Merdeka Palace here.
</P>
<P>
East Timor was a Portuguese colony before 1975. Indonesia
announced the integration of East Timor into the country in 1976
and declared it as the 27th province, but the United Nations never
recognized the move.
</P>
<P>
"The East Timorese should choose. And as a friend, we will let
them decide by themselves and we will say good bye if they decide
on separation from Indonesia," the president was quoted by
national newspapers Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
In a surprise announcement last month, Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas reversed Indonesia's long-held stand on East Timor, saying
if the wide-ranging autonomy for the region is rejected, Indonesia
would offer independence to East Timor's 800,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Habibie's comments came one day after he allowed jailed East
Timorese rebel leader Xanana Gusmao to move from prison to house
arrest.
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Habibie reiterated to the National Commission
on Human Rights his determination to pursue this course of action.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the government would submit a proposal for
independence for East Timor to the People's Consultative Assembly
which is scheduled to convene its general session at the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
His advisor Dewi Fortuna Anwar said the process of separation
would likely begin in July next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
The growth rate for rural income was 11.8 percent greater than
the level for urban residents.
</P>
<P>
A provincial agricultural official attributed the rise in rural
incomes to increased inputs to agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the local government allocated 1.5 billion
yuan to the agricultural sector during 1998, with government loans
to the sector surpassing the 1997 figure by some two billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Other factors contributing to rising rural income levels
included favorable weather conditions, structural readjustments
and the development of processing industries, according to the
official.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning's grain output for the year hit a record 18 billion kg,
with considerable increases in output also recorded for meat,

<P>
ALMA-ATA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh Prime Minister Nurlan
Utebovich Balgimgaev announced Thursday that Kazakhstan will
impose heavy tariffs of up to 200 percent on some imports from
Kirghizstan and Uzbekistan in March in face of massive influx of
foreign goods into the country.
</P>
<P>
The currencies of Kirghizstan and Uzbekistan have greatly
depreciated due to the Russian financial turmoil, but the Kazakh
Tenge has remained steady. As a result, large quantities of
commodities from Kirghizstan and Uzbekistan, especially food and
tobaccos, have poured into Kazakhstan, setting Kazakh businesses
into a difficult situation.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan had to raise its tariff rate on some Russian goods
in January.
</P>
<P>
A Kazakh official said the decision to increase the tax rate is
temporary and aims to protect Kazakhstan's economic stability.
</P>
<P>
The decision did not violate the taxation union of the
Commonwealth of Independent States and the free trade agreement
signed with Uzbekistan, he added.

BRASILIA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso and his Paraguayan counterpart Raul Cubas
Thursday discussed the effects of the devaluation on Brazil's
currency, the real, and the strengthening of the South American
Common Market (Mercosur).
</P>
<P>
The two also confirmed that Mercosur's next summit would be
held on February 21 in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro.
Participants in the Rio summit will study measures to counter the
adverse effects of the real's depreciation on trade within the
bloc.
</P>
<P>
Cubas, who arrived here Thursday morning for a one-day visit,
said the four presidents of Mercosur -- made up of Argentina,
Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay -- would also discuss the same issues
during a European Union-Mercosur forum in Rio on the same day.
</P>
<P>
Uruguayan President Julio Maria Sanguinetti met with Cardoso on
February 3 to prepare the summit. Argentinian President Carlos
Menem will also meet with Cardoso on Friday in the Brazilian city
of Campos do Jordao.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian business representatives said the real's devaluation
could boost Brazilian exports to other Mercosur countries by 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
They said that due to the weak real, Brazil's 1998 trade
deficit of 410 million U.S. dollars with its Mercosur partners
could turn into a 710-million-dollar surplus.
</P>
<P>
They said Brazil's total trade surplus could soar to 1.1
billion dollars this year compared to one billion in 1998.

one-year sentence made by a Maryland's judge Friday for assaulting
two motorists in a minor accident in August.
</P>
<P>
Tyson pleaded no contest to the charges. "We have not received
any paperwork (from Maryland)," said George Walker, Tyson's
probation officer in Indiana, where he was convicted of rape in
1992. "We had a case conference a couple days ago where we took
into consideration the fact Tyson could appeal the sentencing in
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
"So given that situation, we once again have taken a wait-and-
see posture for the next couple weeks to see if in fact he does
appeal."
</P>
<P>
An appeal could lead to jury trial and an even longer jail term
in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
"If he does not appeal, then we'll set a hearing locally and
move forward on that," Walker said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Maryland sentence, Tyson would be eligible in 60 days
to be moved to a pre-release center, which he could leave during
the day in order to train and return at night.
</P>
<P>
With Johnson's permission, Tyson could travel out of state to
fight, and with good behavior, he could be released from custody
in seven months.
</P>
<P>
Walker said he has not indicated to judge Patricia Gifford in
Indiana whether he thinks Tyson should serve more time.
</P>
<P>
"That's not my decision. I wouldn't even say it's my
recommendation. In fact, I don't know particularly right now what
my recommendation would be. It would be unfair to say that,"
Walker said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Can New Zealand Government Survive Confidence Vote? (1)  By Zhou Cipu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Members of the New Zealand
Parliament are coming to Wellington these days to resume the
session on February 16 after a two-month adjournment.
</P>
<P>
When the new round of session starts, the first and immediate
challenge Prime Minister Jenny Shipley and her National-led
minority government will face is whether they can survive a
confidence vote and prevent an early election.
</P>
<P>
The ruling National Party only has 44 seats in the 120-strong
Parliament. The National Party and the NZ First formed a coalition
government after the previous general election in 1996. The
coalition fell apart last August because of severe differences
between the two parties on a number of issues, especially on the
sales of the government-owned shares in the Wellington
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The collapse of the coalition government reduced the votes the
National Party could count on in the Parliament to 62 from the
previous 70. Although the foundation of the National-led minority
government, which Prime Minister Shipley set up after the
coalition government, was unstable, it eventually weathered the
test of a confidence vote last September.
</P>
<P>
Before the recess of the Parliament last year, independent MP
Deborah Morris quit the Parliament, cutting the National-led
minority government's support on confidence issues to just 61
votes in the 120-seat Parliament. The 61 votes come from
National-own 44, ACT's eight, Mauri Pacific's five, United MP
Peter Dunne and three independent MPs.
</P>
<P>
It seems the current government is hanging on by a thin thread,
and can be deprived of its majority support status in the
Parliament and brought down with just one MP switching sides.
</P>
<P>
In the second half of last year, especially around the breakup
of the coalition government, the Labor Party and other opposition
parties cried out for an early election. Although the National-led
minority government tided over the confidence-vote crisis last
September, their demand for an early election was not weakened. In
view of the poor performance of the New Zealand economy and low
support rate for the National Party in polls at that time, they
pinned their hopes for bringing down the government on the
February round of the Parliament's session. The Labor Party, which
enjoyed around 48 support rate in polls at that time, was poised
to lead the government after the next election.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that even the government organs responsible for
election affairs had doubts at that time about Shipley's ability
to keep her government in power until the end of its full term in
November, and they began preparations for election in April.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Can New Zealand Government Survive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The dissolution of the coalition government might be a good
tiding for the National Party. It has enabled Shipley to hold a
stable government and implement the National's economic policies,
such as privatization of state-owned companies, encouragement of
business competition, and advocation of free trade.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand is a trading country. Of every 10 dollars of New
Zealand's national income or GDP, around three dollars comes from
exports.
</P>
<P>
In order to reduce the losses caused by the Asian financial
crisis, the government has been active in expanding New Zealand's
traditional markets in West Europe, the United States and
Australia and opening up new ones in South Asia and Latin
America, while maintaining its close economic links with East
Asia. It also announced a series of "Policies for Progress" to
stimulate the economic activity, expand exports, promote tourism
industry and increase migrants.
</P>
<P>
Through the adjustment in the value of the New Zealand dollar,
a flexible labor market and reduction of input prices such as
electricity, motor vehicles, petrol and diesel and personal
income tax, the government provided an economic environment that
allowed New Zealand exporters to move quickly in response to
global challenges.
</P>
<P>
In the second half of 1998, New Zealand's economic situation
took a favorable turn, thanks to the government efforts. The
country has also benefited from the steady economic growth in
West Europe and the United States and from improved economic
situations in Asian countries. It is fortunate that the recent
financial turmoil in Brazil has had little effects on the New
Zealand economy.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures released by Statistics New Zealand showed
that expanded New Zealand exports in the second half of 1998
enabled the country to increase the value of its exports by five
percent to 12.4 billion U.S. dollars in 1998 compared with the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
while New Zealand shares rising by an average 30 percent in
less than five months, business confidence in the country has
returned to pre-1998 levels. Its GDP ended six-month shrink and
registered a 0.7 percent increase in the third quarter of 1998 and
is expected to keep growing in the fourth quarter. The New
Zealand dollar has regained some of its shine, interest rates
remain at 30-year lows, and prices grew only by 0.4 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
According to New Zealand Treasurer Bill Birch, the country's
economic growth would reach three percent in the year to March
next year, nearly double the 1.6 percent rise in GDP forecast by
the Treasury last December and the New Zealand government would
run a budget surplus again this year, rather than dipping 52
million NZ dollars (28 million U.S. dollars) into the red as
predicted in December.
</P>
<P>
The country is really emerging from economic recession or even
has shrugged off the recessionary blues. Its economy is now on
the track of growth.
</P>
<P>
In such an economic situation, a growing number of New Zealand
people favor political stability in the country. The latest poll
showed that the support rate for the National Party improved and
the support rate for the Labor Party dropped.
</P>
<P>
Lately, the Labor Party and other opposition parties have all
kept silent on the issue of an early election. Up to now, no one
among the 17 non-National MPs has come out, willing to bring a
pre-mature end to the government. It is almost certain that Prime
Minister Shipley and her government will serve their full term to
November unless some unexpected things arise all of a sudden.

<HEADLINE> Four Arrested in Charlton FC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Four men have been arrested as
part of an investigation into a possible betting scam at top
football grounds.
</P>
<P>
The men, only one of whom is a Briton, were arrested on
suspicion of burglary at Charlton Athletic's ground, The Valley,
in south-east London.
</P>
<P>
Their arrest followed alleged damage to electrical equipment
connected to the ground's floodlights.
</P>
<P>
The British man arrested was employed by a security firm at The
Valley.
</P>
<P>
English Football Association (FA) acting chief executive David
Davies said: "Football may have been the intended victim of an
outside attack. That attack has been thwarted for which we are all
grateful."
</P>
<P>
The FA will be contacting all Premier League and Football
League clubs.
</P>
<P>
"The integrity of the game is crucial to us all," he said.
</P>
<P>
The men are in custody where they are being interviewed by the
Metropolitan Police Organised Crime Group.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman said the force was liaising closely with the
Football Association, Premier League and Football League.
</P>
<P>
"We have been given by the FA a list of previous games where
the power supply has failed," she added.
</P>
<P>
There has been conjecture since late 1997 linking floodlight
failures to a Far East betting ring.
</P>
<P>
A single Premiership match is worth millions of pounds to a
betting syndicate.
</P>
<P>
So far as some bets are concerned in parts of Asia, as soon as
the game has passed the halfway mark the result stands even if it
then ends prematurely.
</P>
<P>
Asian syndicates could cash in if a game were to end when the
result was favourable.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Graham Sharpe, of bookmaker William Hill, said the
same rules do not apply in Britain.
</P>
<P>
"Domestically, all bets are void if a match is abandoned, you
keep your stake money but it's impossible to make any money," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the rules were designed to guard against any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
A little over a year ago, Asian gambling syndicates were
accused of arranging a floodlight failure at a Premier League
match.
</P>
<P>
And in the same season, Scotland Yard were investigating a
power failure at the Wimbledon-Arsenal game at Selhurst Park in
south London. There were problems also at Derby and West Ham.

<HEADLINE> FA Draws up England Manager Short List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Football Association is "
very close" to appointing a successor to the sacked England coach
Glenn Hoddle, according to local reports here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Acting chairman Geoff Thompson has revealed they have a "
reasonably short list" of potential candidates
</P>
<P>
A final decision will be taken after caretaker boss Howard
Wilkinson meets Noel White, the head of the FA International
Committee, to inform him whether or not he wishes to be considered.
</P>
<P>
Fulham manager Kevin Keegan has insisted he will not be taking
over despite being many people's choice for the job.
</P>
<P>
Wilkinson was put in charge for Wednesday's friendly against
France following Hoddle's departure last week.
</P>
<P>
The FA now faces a race against time to put someone in place
for the vital European Championship qualifier against Poland at
Wembley on March 27.
</P>
<P>
Thompson said: "I think we are very close to filling the
position."
</P>
<P>
He gave no indication as to who is on the short-list but the
situation should become clearer following Wilkinson's meeting with
White on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to have someone as quickly as possible but you can't
appoint people overnight. Some are not available and other people
may already be in positions.
</P>
<P>
"We want the best man for the job, but how long it takes is a
bit like a piece of string," Thompson added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
consumers will benefit liberalization of markets such as
telecommunications, a European commissioner told a new local
magazine in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Karel Van Miert, EU commissioner for competition, said in the
first issue of Trends International published here Thursday that
the consumers have already started to see the benefits. "They will
be seeing more in the near future, no doubt," he said.
</P>
<P>
In 10 out of 15 EU member states, full liberalization of all
telecommunications markets was achieved as of January 1, 1998, the
commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
"That is a pretty record given the complexity of the problem.
Even in the first year of liberalization, there were numerous new
operators. They entered the market and are now challenging the
former monopoly operators," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Take a look at the price cuts. International calls, for
example, have gone down by 3 to 27 percent in the different member
states," Van Miert said.

The European Commission is planning a series of reforms
measures, both as regards anti-trust legislation and state aid,
in a bid to ensure that the EU policy framework can continue to
face the challenges of future enlargement, newly liberalized
markets, increased globalization and the changed situation with
the euro, Van Miert said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the February 11 issue of Trends
International, Van Miert said that adapting the policy framework
effectively means building on past experience as well, and this is
why control of mergers will continue to be a major priority.
</P>
<P>
"The last few years have seen a new wave, mainly due to
globalization and technological change. Now the euro is here we
have to be even more vigilance," he said.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner said the euro will clearly lead to national
markets opening up and becoming more European and will push many
firms towards joint ventures and mergers. There has already been a
significant increase in the number of complaints submitted to the
commission, the EU's executive branch mainly responsible for
proposing and enforcing legislation.
</P>
<P>
Another priority for the commission is reducing state aid in
the 15-country EU, Van Miert said. This is all the more necessary
given Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) and the commitment to
enlargement. As far as classic anti-trust action is concerned, the
top priority will be identifying, prohibiting and, where
appropriate, fining cartels, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We will also continue to pursue cases where the free market is
being hindered by restrictions on parallel trade between member
states. Sectors currently being liberalized will also come in for
close scrutiny. Fair competition has to be enforced in those
sectors," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Finally, my staff and I will continue with the push for
liberalization in the field of air transport by insisting on the
application of competition directives," the commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here in the Trends International magazine predict
that tougher competition such as new merger wave and an
ever-growing awareness of unfair trade practices in Europe are
putting great pressure on the European Commission. Therefore 1999
will also be a tougher year for the EU executive.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Launches Attacks in Both No-Fly Zones in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- In addition to attacks
Thursday in the northern no-fly zone, U.S. warplanes launched new
attacks against Iraqi air defense targets in the southern no-fly
zone in Iraq, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Capt. Mike Doubleday said the attacks in the
southern no-fly zone occurred at about 10:45 a.m. EST (1545 GMT).
</P>
<P>
He said U.S. Air Force and Navy fighter jets struck two
anti-aircraft missile sites and associated facilities like radar
and equipment after a pair of Iraqi MiG-23s flew into the no-fly
zone.
</P>
<P>
The incidents took place near Al Habbriyah, about 135 miles
(217 km) southwest of Baghdad, and near Al Amarah, about 170 miles
(273 km) southeast of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
"All aircraft have returned to their bases safely and battle
damage assessment is ongoing," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, U.S. fighter jets launched attacks against at
least five Iraqi targets in the northern no-fly zone with no
damage to U.S. aircraft and no injuries to U.S. pilots, another
Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Col. Steve Campbell, said.
</P>
<P>
In the first incident, between about 12:15 p.m. and 12:30 p.m.
local time (0915 and 0930 GMT), a U.S. Air force F-15E strike
Eagle observed Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery fire and was
"illuminated" by an Iraqi radar system near the northern city of
Mosul.
</P>
<P>
"Acting in self-defense, one F-15E dropped four GBU12
precision-guided bombs on a surface-to-air missile communications
site," a Defense Department statement said. Two other F-15Es
launched a missile and dropped four bombs on an Iraqi
surface-to-air missile system.
</P>
<P>
An hour later, U.S. pilots retaliated in three separate
incidents, with F-15Es bombing a SAM site and a communications
site, and an Air Force F-16CJ launching a high-speed
anti-radiation missile at an Iraqi radar site.
</P>
<P>
Doubleday said that in total, U.S. warplanes operating from
land and sea bases attacked at least seven targets in both the
northern and southern no-fly zones Thursday, targets ranging from
Iraqi missile communication sites to radar sites.
</P>
<P>
The latest attacks are in line with the Pentagon's more
aggressive policy in retaliation against Iraq's defiance in the
no-fly zones, which Baghdad declared violation by U.S. and British
aircraft of its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Doubleday said U.S. and British attacks since December had had
a "grave impact" on Iraq's air defense system and weakened them
considerably.
</P>
<P>
"We believe we have been effective in hitting the targets
threatening coalition forces and our intention is that as long as
they continue these provocative actions we will continue to
respond," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Annoyed by Aziz Visit to Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States Thursday
was irritated by Turkey's Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit's
invitation of Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz to pay a
visit next week.
</P>
<P>
"We don't understand Prime Minister Ecevit's decision to host
Tariq Aziz at this time. Obviously we'll be in diplomatic contact
with the Turkish government on this matter," State Department
spokesman James Rubin said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
He expects Turkey, a NATO ally of the United States, would
blame the Iraqi government for the regional troubles.
</P>
<P>
"We expect that the Turkish government will make it clear to
Tariq Aziz that the roots of the current confrontation with Iraq
are Baghdad's eight-year-long refusal to meet its U.N. obligations
and more recently its challenges to the no-fly zones," he said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said Thursday that he will ask Turkey to terminate the
U.S.-British mandate to use Incirlik and halt their attacks on
Iraqi anti-aircraft batteries in the north.
</P>
<P>
But regional analysts said Turkey is unlikely to seriously
cross its main diplomatic backers in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit has criticized U.S. aims in Iraq. His defense minister
called last week for a review of the rules of engagement for the
U.S. and British air patrol in the no-fly zones in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Sets for Climactic Friday Impeachment Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- With acquittal assured, the
Senate talked its way through a third and final day of closed-door
deliberations Thursday at President Bill Clinton's impeachment
trial, set for climactic noontime votes Friday in the case.
</P>
<P>
A steady stream of lawmakers came forward to announce their
intentions for the roll calls on perjury and obstruction of
justice, dividing largely along party lines on presidential guilt
or innocence but offering nonpartisan condemnations of Clinton's
behavior with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in the two
articles of impeachment in connection with his relationship with
Lewinsky. The two articles were approved by the House along
partisan lines on December 19 last year.
</P>
<P>
For all the expressions of disgust, a formal effort to censure
the president appeared all but dead, a victim of Republican
opposition. Democrats said they would make an effort to force a
post-trial vote on the Senate floor, and failing passage, would
draft a statement of condemnation.
</P>
<P>
A two-thirds vote is required to convict the president and
remove him from office, and there was no chance of that happening.
Instead, whatever suspense lingered at the end of the five-week
trial was whether either article of impeachment would attain a
bare majority -- a psychological threshold that had no bearing on
Clinton's fate.
</P>
<P>
Three Republicans, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, John Chafee
of Rhode Island and James Jeffords of Vermont, announced Wednesday
they would not vote for conviction on either article.
</P>
<P>
Among Democrats, Senate aides said the only question was
whether Robert Byrd of West Virginia, a longtime party leader,
would break ranks and join Republicans in voting to convict.
</P>
<P>
Controversy broke out over a report that Clinton had vowed
revenge on House Republicans at the polls in 2000.
</P>
<P>
"It is deeply troubling that the president views closure of
this constitutional process as an opportunity for revenge," said
Majority Leader Trent Lott, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart didn't deny presidential
anger, but said, "I can't think of a worse, more dumb strategy
than going after people based on whether they were a House manager
or not."
</P>
<P>
"You look at the House managers and the vast majority are in
safe seats or unopposed seats," he said. The 2000 election is 21
months distant, and Clinton has promised a strenuous effort to
help Democrats regain control of Congress.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Unveil Three Panels on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The composition of
three panels to review key aspects of U.N. relations with Iraq may
be announced late Friday and they could begin to work a week or so
later, their Chairman Celso Amorim said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Celso Amorim, Brazil's ambassador to the
United Nations, said, "I hope I will be able to finalize the
panels today or tomorrow, to make an announcement by tomorrow
evening probably."
</P>
<P>
"I would hope that the panels could start to meet at the end of
next week or the beginning of the following week," Amorim said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council reached an agreement on
January 30 to establish the three panels to help with its
discussion of "options which would lead to the full implementation
of all relevant Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Amorim gave no indication of the membership of the panels.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Schroeder Renew Air Strike Threat on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton and
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder Thursday renewed threats of
NATO air strikes should Kosovo peace talks at Rambouillet, near
Paris, fail.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder told reporters after his meeting with Clinton at the
White House they agreed that "the international community cannot
and will not accept either delay or failure and thus made clear a
willingness, as before and without hesitation, to undertake a NATO
strike."
</P>
<P>
He said he and Clinton also agreed that the talks, which began
last Saturday, must produce a result "in the time that has been
set aside." He stressed that time limits imposed on the Serbian
and Kosovo Albanian sides would not be extended.
</P>
<P>
The six-nation Contact Group has given the warring sides two
weeks to reach a deal to end the 11-month Kosovo conflict, but
diplomatic sources say the talks have not moved much beyond
opening draft proposals on political aspects of an accord.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder was in Washington for a one-day visit for what was
described as an informal meeting with Clinton, at which they
discussed Kosovo, the April NATO summit in Washington, the world
economic situation and Russia.

<HEADLINE> NOAA Sets Up Web Site on Global Warming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration announced here recently that it has
set up a global warming web site named "A Paleo Perspective On
Global Warming," to help general public and journalists understand
global warming.
</P>
<P>
The web site, also called "handbook" on global warming,
explains global warming and the greenhouse effect, and describes
how they relate to the issues of atmospheric ozone change. Out
from other global warming web sites, it places current warming in
the context of past temperature variations through the use of
paleoclimatic data.
</P>
<P>
It tells how scientists study global warming, including how
they study variations in the Earth's temperature using satellite,
instrumental and paleoclimatic data extending as far back as
millions of years. It also provides scientists with records of
past climatic change extending back centuries and millennia.
</P>

<HEADLINE> UK Troops Preparing for Possible Kosovo Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Britain said Thursday that its
troops will support any peacekeeping operations if a deal is
reached between the warring factions in the Serbian province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary George Robertson told parliament that his
ministry is preparing forces which could make up part of a NATO
presence in Kosovo if a peace deal between Yugoslav Serb
authorities and separatist ethnic Albanians is struck.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that the troops could move at a moment's notice, an
advance force of tanks, armored vehicles, artillery and some 200
key logistics personnel is being sent to the region Monday, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The United Kingdom is determined to play its part in
supporting a negotiated settlement to Kosovo. But we will only
deploy our forces in support of an operation with a clear mission
and clear objectives and alongside our allies," Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
But he added that no decision had yet been taken to send troops
or equipment into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group on former Yugoslavia, comprising Britain,
Germany, France, Italy, Russia and the United States, has given
Serbian and Kosovo Albanian leaders, who are currently conducting
peace talks in France, two weeks to reach a deal to end their
almost year-long conflict.
</P>
<P>
Reports say the talks at the French town of Rambouillet near
Paris have not made much progress beyond opening draft proposals
on political aspects of an accord.
</P>
<P>
Robertson said it was unclear whether a NATO force would be
needed to support a peace agreement although he said the talks
were making some progress.
</P>
<P>
"A military force which is to be effective must be assembled
well in advance and this means we and our allies must have forces
in the region ready to go into action at short notice," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is for this reason that the government has decided today to
send to the region at the beginning of next week the vehicles and
other heavy equipment of the units which would form the leading
elements of any deployment."
</P>
<P>
About 200 logistics personnel would be sent to Greece and
Macedonia, which borders on Kosovo, to prepare for the arrival of
this equipment but most troops from the units involved would
remain at their bases on standby to move.
</P>
<P>
The defense secretary also insisted that the troops would only
be sent in if a deal was reached.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investors Worry About Fiscal Incentives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Council of the Foreign
Investors in Romania expressed their worries on the cancellation
of the fiscal incentives for the investors, said a Thursday report
of the Rompres news agency.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian parliament Monday passed a proposition of the
government to suspend preferential policy for foreign investments,
according to which the custom tariffs and value-added taxes are
exempted for any foreign investment. The policy, approved last
year, was guaranteed then by the government to be in place for at
least five years.
</P>
<P>
The foreign investors believed that the Romanian government has
other solutions likely to increase the budget revenues, one of
these being a better Finance Ministry tax collection.
</P>
<P>
The Council of the Foreign Investors in Romania is made up of
60 foreign companies that have made investments worth about 2.5
billion U.S. dollars, with ABN AMRO Bank, McDonald's, Citibank,
Chase Manhattan, Coca Cola Services, Mobifon, Mobilrom, Daewoo
Corporation, Societe Generale, British American Tobacco, Nestle,
Shell, Tuborg, Kraft Jacobs Suchard, and BERD being just some of
them.
