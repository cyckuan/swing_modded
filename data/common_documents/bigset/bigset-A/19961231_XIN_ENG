SEOUL -- South Korea today returned the remains of the 24 armed
people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) killed

<HEADLINE> China Looking For Foreign Funds For Coal Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- China is looking for foreign
funds for construction and modernization of coal mines, according
to Wang Senhao, minister of the coal industry, who says the
country will follow the "who invests, benefits" principle and work
out a series of preferential policies.
</P>
<P>
To attract foreign mining companies, trading companies, and
financial institutions to operate coal mines, it will allow joint
ventures or partnerships, and will use foreign funds to modernize
existing mines by means of converting state-owned assets at
certain coal companies into shares to improve mines for better
economic returns.
</P>
<P>
Direct foreign investment will also be used for constructing
coal slurry pipelines, tapping coalbed methane, building pit-head
power plants, and developing clean coal technology, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
In the coming years, China will devote greater efforts to
pre-construction preparations at more than a dozen large-and
medium-scale pit-head power plants in the Junggar Basin and other
mining areas by using foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
China will also try hard to exploit coalbed methane as a
secondary coal resource and cooperate with foreign companies in
exploiting coalbed methane resources. The country wants to
establish two to four coalbed methane tapping centers by the end
of the century.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it will try to develop a large number of
comprehensive coal utilization projects with foreign funds,
including coking plants, cement plants, mining machinery plants,
and refractories.

<HEADLINE> China Speeds Up Housing Industry Modernization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- China is stepping up efforts
to modernize its housing industry for large-scale construction of
residential housing nationwide, according to Minister of
Construction Hou Jie.
</P>
<P>
Hou told Xinhua today that a number of large cities and
provinces will serve as pilot sites for accelerated housing
modernization as part of the ministry's housing modernization
program.
</P>
<P>
These include the cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin,
Changchun, and Harbin and east China's Jiangsu, Zhejiang and
Shandong provinces, south China's Guangdong Province and southwest
China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the modernization of housing projects
in China would take three to five years years.
</P>
<P>
In spite of some remarkable developments made in housing over
recent years, he said, the country still has a long ways to go to
catch up to advanced countries.
</P>
<P>
At present, China's annual housing construction is one billion
sq.m. Investment in the sector accounts for 30 percent of the
country's fixed-asset investment, so there is an urgent need to
improve the industry's efficiency and quality of construction, and
quality of building materials.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the pilot sites should give top priority
to urban designing, and introducing market-oriented housing.

<HEADLINE> Kazakh President Optimistic on National Economy in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan's economy grew in
1996 for the first time since independence in 1990, and will
continue to grow in 1997, Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev
said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in a year-end review of the economy, he
said statistics showed that in 1996 Kazakhstan's gross domestic
product (GDP) and industrial output both increased 0.5 percent
from the previous year, and agricultural output increased by 7
percent.
</P>
<P>
Though small, the increase in GDP represented a turning point
for the country's economic development, Nazarbayev said.
</P>
<P>
The government has targeted an increase of more than 2 percent
for GDP and industrial output in 1997 and 3.5 percent for
agricultural output.
</P>
<P>
During the first 11 months of this year, Kazakhstan's inflation
rate was 27 percent, compared with 60 percent for the same period
last year. The government is aiming to bring the rate of
inflation down further to 17.5-18 percent by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev said the country's foreign trade also rose strongly
in 1996, but he did not provide detailed figures.
</P>
<P>
As for Kazakhstan's political situation, Nazarbayev spoke
highly of the country's new parliament under the two-chamber
system.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his appreciation for the Kazakh people's
understanding for the difficulties the country is facing during
its transition period to a market economy.
</P>
<P>
It was with the understanding of the people that the country
could maintain its social stability and national harmony, the
president added.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Cement Price Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Circle Cement, one of
Zimbabwe's largest cement manufacturers, said today it would
increase the price of cement by 21 percent in January in response
to increased demand for the product and escalating cost of
production.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director Ian Coulter said Circle Cement had been
facing a number of steep rises in its manufacturing costs over
the past few months, especially in fuel, power and other
supplies.
</P>
<P>
The increases have had a negative effect on the company's
profit margin, prompting the price increase.
</P>
<P>
The weakening of the exchange rate of the Zimbabwe Dollar
against major currencies, Coulter said, also resulted in a
significant increase in the cost of capital plant and equipment
and of the related engineering spares.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''these trends lead to the regrettable conclusion
that selling prices must be raised to protect the long-term
viability of the business to continue to supply the market.''
</P>
<P>
He said, ''accordingly, with effect from January 1, 1997,
ex-works prices quoted in tons will be 83.2 U.S. Dollars for
cement in bags and cement in bulk will be 79.2 U.S. Dollars per
ton.''

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Jewel Industry Looks to Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Jewel Council of Zimbabwe
has challenged the local jewel industry to penetrate eastern
Europe markets that opened up.
</P>
<P>
In a report released here today, the council said the end of
the cold war has seen the lifting of trade barriers in eastern
Europe, creating a demand for jewelery, which Zimbabwe could
fulfill.
</P>
<P>
It expressed optimism for the industry, saying Zimbabwe was
producing adequate quantities of gold, emerald, diamonds and
soon, platinum.
</P>
<P>
The council applauded the partial lifting of restrictive
legislation and the suppressive import licenses, saying it had
contributed to the expansion of the industry.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the low value of the Zimbabwe Dollar against
other currencies was causing an unprecedented tourist boom which
was good for the industry.
</P>
<P>
However, excessive duty charged on imported materials such as
stones and chains was affecting development of the jewel
industry.
</P>
<P>
The industry was concerned that local gold mines had become
expensive to operate and the country was gradually becoming less
and less competitive as its production costs continued to
increase.
</P>
<P>
In view of this, it warned, Zimbabwe's gold industry was going
to come under increasingly strong pressure to maintain viability.

<HEADLINE> Year-Ender: Saudi Arabia Records Better Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The world's top oil
producer and exporter Saudi Arabia saw in 1996 an economic surge
to reach the highest level in the past decade because of the
sharp increase in oil prices and growth in other sectors.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia sits on a quarter of the world's proven oil
reserves and the performance of oil prices in world markets
mirrors the country's financial wealth. Banking and industry
sources said that each one-dollar-barrel change in oil prices
translates into 2.5 billion U.S. dollars annually -- up or
down. Oil makes up 70 percent of the Saudi state revenue.
</P>
<P>
With the average price of Saudi light and heavy crudes
reaching around 18.5 dollars a barrel in 1996, the kingdom's
economy is estimated to grow by around 6 percent to 132.5 billion
dollars compared with 125.06 billion dollars in 1995. The 1995
figure was a 4.3 percent increase on the basis of a negative
growth rate in 1994, according to official forecasts.
</P>
<P>
Economists predicted that oil earnings would exceed the
budgeted amount by between 6 billion and 10 billion dollars this
year, giving it hopes that its forecast 4.9 billion dollars
deficit on spending of the budgeted 40 billion dollars would
either be in balance or in surplus by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first time in 10 years to wipe out its budget
deficit which was greatly increased in the 1991 Gulf War when the
kingdom combated the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait by allowing a
U.S. led international coalition to use it as a base at a high
political and financial cost.
</P>
<P>
Its current account deficit will be below 1 percent of the GDP
compared with 3 percent of the GDP, or 6 billion dollars, in the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
The private sector which usually looks at how much the
government is earning responded positively to the surge in oil
prices by increasing its investments.
</P>
<P>
On the agricultural front, the Saudi Agriculture and Water
Ministry has issued licenses to implement 60 new projects
involving a capital investment of 100.46 million dollars during
the year.
</P>
<P>
The stock market which is a barometer of the strength of the
economy surged ahead in the second half of the year with a gain
of nearly 9 percent as an increase in oil prices spurred a
business upturn and pumped more liquidity into the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
"With the GDP exceeding 450 billion riyals (120 billion
dollars), it is obvious that the Saudi economy has enormous
potential, not only is the economy the largest in the Middle
East, but more importantly, it is still growing,"
secretary-general of the Jeddah Chamber of Commerce and Industry
Abdullah S. Dahlan said recently.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the year, the kingdom also initiated a number of
mega projects with the aim of further developing the oil and
non-oil industries.
</P>
<P>
It signed, for example, a contract with the U.S. firm Ralph
M. Parsons to expand the Uthmaniyah gas plant worth 211 million
dollars in eastern Saudi Arabia. The plant is one of the three
centers in the major upstream portion of the Saudi natural gas
processing network of 138 million cubic meters daily.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom is currently implementing 13 electricity projects
at a total cost of 6.03 billion dollars to produce 8.15
megawatts of power in efforts to meet the target set by the Sixth
Five-Year Plan envisaging an annual electricity demand increase
of 6.4 percent by the year 2000. Draft plans to invest 21
billion dollars for 30 new power projects to be conducted from
1998 to 2001 were being considered this year.

<HEADLINE> Year-Ender: Saudi Arabia Records Better Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saudi Finance and National Economy Minister Ibrahim Abdel Aziz
Al-Asaf said, "The Saudi economy is beginning to bear the fruit
of the wise policies the government adopted in the past few
years."
</P>
<P>
Saudi King Fahd, while describing the Saudi economy as
strong, said on the occasion of the National Day in September
that his kingdom would go ahead with its development
projects. Echoing his remarks, Al-Asaf told the annual meetings
of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in
Washington at the end of the same month that Saudi Arabia was
determined to press ahead with reforms.
</P>
<P>
The year also witnessed accelerated moves to normalize the
bilateral relations with Yemen as both countries exchanged
high-level visits to push forward the process of settling the
60-year-old lingering border disputes. The two countries singed
three agreements, one on fighting crimes, exchange of criminals
and security expertise, another on combating drug trafficking,
and the third on economic, commercial, investment and technical
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has managed to speed up normalizing
political relations with those Arab countries that had
sympathized with Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Cautiously showing a relaxation attitude toward Iraq, Saudi
Arabia refused the U.S. the use of its military base in the
kingdom to launch a possible attack against Iraqi targets during
the American-Iraqi confrontation in September.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia also worked hard to further strengthen
traditional political, economic and military relations with
France within the cooperation framework with European Union
countries. It received in July French President Jacques Chirac,
getting a promise from France that it would set up around 20 new
investment projects in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
But efforts in diversifying the Saudi economy from petroleum
and in creating more job opportunities for its growing population
have made little progress. The Saudi 1995-2000 economic plan
seeks a bigger private sector role, diversification and finding
jobs for its citizens, which economists say is a long-term and
slow process.
</P>
<P>
The year also ended, however, with some troubles.
</P>
<P>
King Fahd, who has ruled the kingdom for 13 years, once handed
over power to his younger half-brother Crown Prince Abdallah Ibn
Abdel Aziz at the beginning of the year apparently because of a
stroke. His poor health raised doubts about the political
stability in the country although he recovered soon and resumed
his reign. Western speculation about succession in the tightly
controlled kingdom had previously affected world oil prices in a
market that closely follows the king's state of health.
</P>
<P>
At the end of June, a truck explosion in an American air base
complex in Dhahran, eastern Saudi Arabia, claimed lives of 19
U.S. air servicemen and injured hundreds of others. The culprits
are still at large.
</P>
<P>
In mid November, a jumbo Boeing 747 airliner crashed in a
collision with a Kazakh cargo plane over India, killing more
than 300 passengers on board.
</P>
<P>
These developments, especially the truck blast, are sending
alarming signals and raising a lot of question marks at a time
when the political and economic situation seems to be getting
better, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Up New Rural Banking System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- A new rural banking system has
been established in China, involving rural credit agencies, the
Agricultural Bank of China (ABC), and the Agricultural Development
Bank of China (ADBC), according to the Deputy Director of the
State Council Inter-Departmental Coordinative Group for Rural
Financial Reforms Duan Xiaoxing, who spoke recently with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
In the past 12 months, the country has changed the
administrative and managerial system in over 52,000 rural credit
agencies around the country, and has improved ADBC, the policy
bank for rural development, and commercialized ABC, one of the
country's four largest state-owned commercial banks, according to
Duan.
</P>
<P>
ADBC was founded in late 1994 to separate policy loans from
commercial banking business in the agricultural sector, and the
separation of rural credit agencies from the ABC this year means
the formation of a new agricultural banking structure, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Duan told Xinhua that in 1997 China will move to standardize
rural credit agencies in line with international practices and set
up ADBC local branches in all provinces, cities, and autonomous
regions by May.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that rural credit agencies handle a fifth of
China's savings deposits and are the country's second largest
place for savings after the Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China.
</P>
<P>
By the end of November, rural credit agencies had more than 860.6
billion yuan in various kinds of deposits, up 143.3 billion yuan
from the beginning of the year, while loans amounted to 631.2
billion yuan, an increase of 113.6 billion yuan for the same
period.
</P>
<P>
The ABC had 877.28 billion yuan in deposits, 183.34 billion
yuan more than the figure of 11 months ago, and loans amounted to
762.99 billion yuan in the same period.

<HEADLINE> Wild Plants Protection Code to Go Into Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Regulation concerning Wild
Plants Protection of the People's Republic Of China issued by the
State Council is expected to come into effect as from January 1.
</P>
<P>
This was announced jointly by the Ministry of Forestry, the
Ministry of Agriculture and the Legislative Affairs Bureau of the
State Council here today.
</P>
<P>
The Regulation, introduced as the first of its kind in China,
comprise five chapters which explicitly define the principles
regarding wild plants protection, management, sale, import and
export as well as the penalties on illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Zhibao, vice-minister of forestry, this
represents another big step China has taken in the protection
of wild plants after the code on protection of
wild animals was issued in 1988.
</P>
<P>
"We regard the protection of wildlife and biological varieties
as a major mission for humanity as well as our tremendous
responsibility," he said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics shows that currently China boasts more than 30,000
species of higher plants, ranking third in the world only next to
Malaysia and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
According to the Wang, China has so far established 574 natural
reserves, occupying 5.4 percent of the nation's total land area.
</P>
<P>
"More than 1,000 species of rare and precious plants have been
well protected thanks to local efforts in hundreds of breeding
bases and 13,000 hectares of seed gardens across the country," the
vice-minister said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Institute: Economic Conditions Now Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Belgrade Institute for
Market Research (IZIT) has said that the Yugoslav economic trends
are more favorable at the end of this year than they were a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia will start the year 1997 with an increased
production growth and reserves of raw materials and intermediates
as well as a better exploitation of production capacities,
Tomislav Milisavljevic of the IZIT told a press conference today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the IZIT's latest analysis of the overall
economic trends in 1996 and expectations for 1997, Milisavljevic
said the stability of the national currency, the Dinar, had been
preserved and the growth of inflation reduced.
</P>
<P>
The IZIT believes that the exports and investments will be
crucial for the overall economic activity throughout 1997.
</P>
<P>
This is supported by the IZIT's November poll on the expected
economic activity in 1997, in which Yugoslav businessmen gave
positive answers for almost all trends, excluding exports and
investments, Milisavljevic said.

<HEADLINE> China To Conduct National Agriculture Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- China will conduct a general
survey on agricultural conditions starting January 1, according to
a circular issued by the General Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The circular calls for governments at various levels to put the
survey on their agenda and to work up a budget to cover its cost,
which will be paid by both the central government and local
offices.
</P>
<P>
Institutions and individuals are not allowed to increase burden
on farmers in the name of the agricultural survey, it said.
</P>
<P>
Local governments should relate the survey to existing
agricultural and rural policies, protecting land contracts in
rural areas so as to safeguard the prestige of the contracts,
according to the circular.
</P>
<P>
They should also ensure the stable collection of agricultural
taxes and stable grain purchases by the state.
</P>
<P>
After the survey, the acreage of the country's arable lands may
indicate changes, but villages and townships should not charge
excessive fees wilfully from local farmers, the circular said.

<HEADLINE> Investment Vital in National Development: Isaias </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Eritrean President Isaias
Afwerki said his government policy underlines the importance of
attracting both foreign and domestic potential investors so as to
bring about economic development.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest issue of weekly ''Eritrea Profile'',
President Isaias made the the remark in an interview with
Eritrean Television after returning home from working visits to
the U.S. and the UK.
</P>
<P>
Isaias said, it has now been three years since Eritrea was
officially recognized as an independent country, and during this
period it has proved to itself and to others that it is capable
of attracting foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that his government would do its best to
encourage investment by improving the country's infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
On the relations between investment and aid, he said: ''it is
undeniable that aid is important and imperative when one faces a
critical or an emergency situation. However, at this specific
juncture, aid will only weaken the initiative to work hard among
our people and cause psychological frailty and indolence.''
</P>
<P>
Isaias stressed the importance of optimum use of investment
opportunities and action to promote internal growth through the
implementation of effective policies without resorting to undue
dependence on external aid.
</P>
<P>
Due to constraints in the availability of sufficient capital
and experience, he said, the nation has not yet been able to
adequately harness its resources.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the size of foreign investment in Eritrea, he said
seven mining companies are already in Eritrea and a tourism based
investment is underway and he welcomed entrepreneurs to invest in
agriculture, manufacturing, mining, power generation, fisheries
and transport and communication.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea is a young African country with a population of 3.5
million and an area of 125,000 square kilometers.

<HEADLINE> US Existing Homes Sales Show 1st Gain in 6 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Sales of existing homes in
the U.S. rose by 1.8 percent in November, the first increase in
six months, the U.S. National Association of Realtors said today.
</P>
<P>
The association reported that sales of previously owned
single-family homes totaled 4.04 million at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate, up from 3.97 million in October.
</P>
<P>
It was the first increase since last May when the sales rose by
1.9 percent to a 4.28 million rate. Sales of the existing home in
the U.S. had dropped in a straight of five months since then.
</P>
<P>
Still, sales remained above the 4 million level except for
October and the realtors predict a 4.09 million total for all of
1996, breaking the 3.99 million record set in 1978.
</P>
<P>
The increase of sales was attributed by many analysts to the
declining rates of mortgages in the country.
</P>
<P>
After reaching 8.32 percent in June, 30-year, fixed-rate
mortgages dropped to 7.62 percent in November, according to
surveys by the U.S. Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, sales jumped by 4.9 percent in the Midwest and by
4.5 percent in the West. The sales were up only by 0.7 percent in
th South. But they were down by 4.8 percent in the Northeast, the
only region where the sales declined.

<HEADLINE> S. African Trade with Asia to Beat 1995 Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Trade between South
Africa and Asian countries in 1996 will exceed the record 42
billion Rands (about 9 billion U.S. dollars) of last year, the
South African Foreign Ministry announced today.
</P>
<P>
"Significant investments also had flowed into South Africa
from Asia, especially from Japan and Malaysia," South African
Press Association (SAPA) quoted a statement by the ministry as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Asia is South Africa's second largest trading block after the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Europe remained the largest trading partner
of South Africa in 1996 although the latter's trade with other
parts of the world was increasing more rapidly.
</P>
<P>
South African exports to Europe had increased from 23 billion
Rands (4.9 billion U.S. dollars) in 1991 to 31 billion Rands (6.7
billion U.S. dollars) last year, while imports had almost doubled
to 47 billion Rands (10 billion U.S. dollars) last year from 24
billion Rands (5 billion U.S dollars) in 1991, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
"Europe is still the most important source of foreign direct
investment in South Africa with the United Kingdom, Germany and
Switzerland in the lead."
</P>
<P>
The statement said that 1996 saw South Africa having improved
diplomatic and trade relations with all gulf countries, and that
South Africa's exports to the Arab Peninsula increased to 882
million Rands (190 million U.S. dollars) between 1994 and 1995,
while imports, mostly oil, rose to 6.2 billion Rands (1,300
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In addition to trade achievements, the statement said, South
Africa had made great progress in closing ties with European and
Southern African countries, and in bringing an end to regional
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Referring to relations with Asian countries, the statement
noted, the ties between South Africa and China had changed
dramatically after President Nelson Mandela announced in late
November a switch of diplomatic relations from Taiwan to the
People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
On relations with the United States, the statement said, the
second round of South Africa-U.S Bilateral Commission
consultations in Washington in July had been an important
milestone in the evolution of ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a stream of high level visits, the relations between
South African and European countries have become "trouble free",
the statement said.

<HEADLINE> UK Political Parties Furious at Kinkel Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 30 (Xinhua) -- British political leaders were
furious with German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, who urged
Britain to commit itself to closer European integration, saying
that it was up to British people to make their own choice.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a new year message earlier today, Kinkel warned
Britain that it must make a clear-cut choice on its European
policy as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"The country (Britain) must reach a clear decision on its
European policy. Britain belongs to Europe. Europe needs Britain,"
Kinkel said.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel's remarks have drawn furious reactions from all the main
political parties of Britain, which is due to hold a general
election by next May.
</P>
<P>
Labor's foreign affairs spokesman Robin Cook flatly rejected
the German minister's suggestion that a firm commitment on the
single European currency should be made immediately.
</P>
<P>
"We have stressed that a Labor government could only join a
single currency with the consent of the British people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Britain's ruling Conservative party chairman Brian Mawhinney
tried to turn Kinkel's remarks into Conservative advantage by
slamming Labor leader Tony Blair who is commonly regarded as
pro-European.
</P>
<P>
The British voters would decide whether they wanted to elect
John Major, who would "defend British interests" in Europe, or
Blair, who would "do what the other European leaders tell him," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Britain's Liberal Democratic party leader Paddy
Ashdown also rejected Kinkel's comments by saying, "I think Klaus
Kinkel's comments are unhelpful and almost certainly unwise."
</P>
<P>
"The British people are perfectly capable of making up their
own minds," he added.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Negotiators Gear up Talks to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators today geared up talks amid optimistic atmosphere of
clinching a long-delayed agreement on Israeli troop redeployment
in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to reach the Hebron deal Tuesday by the end of the
year, a flurry of diplomatic activities were under way today to
bridge the gap between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, senior Palestinian
official Abu Mazen and U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk
joined the the talks held in a Jerusalem hotel.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, who met with Palestinian Authority (PA) President
Yasser Arafat Sunday night, told reporters that the Hebron
talks were nearing conclusion and a deal could be signed
soon. He described the meeting with Arafat as good and
friendly.
</P>
<P>
"The talks are set to be closed ... are to be concluded
on all subjects between the Palestinian and Israeli sides. (We
are) very close to the situation that both sides can sign
the agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Abu Mazen, Arafat's deputy in the PA, also expressed
optimism that a deal could be signed soon. He said he
thought that no surprise would delay the signing of such an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat met with
Dore Gold, diplomatic aide of Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu, to discuss other matters related to further
Israeli-Palestinian talks after forging the Hebron deal.
</P>
<P>
Among the issues discussed included the further redeployment
of Israeli troops in the West Bank, opening of safe passages
between the West Bank and Gaza Strip, release of Palestinian
prisoners and resuming the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
The reamining obstacle blocking a deal is believed to be
the Palestinian demand for an official presence near the Tomb
of Patriachs, the religious shrine holy to both Jews and
Moslems. The PA is proposing joint police patrols in the
area, which was firmly rejected by Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Both Israeli and Palestinian officials said that they hoped
that Netanyahu would hold a summit with Arafat to wrap up the
deal.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said that if the two sides could bridge the remaining
gap, he expected the Arafat-Netanyahu summit could take place
Tuesday to sign a deal in the U.S. and Egyptian presence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross returned to Israel
late today and would join the talks this evening. Ross
headed back last week to Washington to brief President Bill
Clinton on the Hebron talks after achieving a breakthrough in
breaking the ice in the Hebron talks by arranging an
Arafat-Netanyahu summit.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Ambassador: Talks with PA Should Not </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Ambassador to Egypt Zvi
Mazel said today the troubled Palestinian-Israeli negotiations
should not baffle the relations with Egypt, the path-breaker of
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mazel told reporters that greater efforts needed to maintain
relations with Egypt, after a meeting with senior Egyptian Foreign
Ministry officials today. The meeting was aimed at improving
Egyptian-Israeli ties, especially in economic and trade domains.
</P>
<P>
Veteran diplomat Mazel, 57, assumed office here early this
month, relacing David Sultan who retuned home in August.
</P>
<P>
The newly-appointed ambassador lavished praise on the important
role of Egypt in the peace process, saying that the
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations were taking place in coordination
with it. "Egypt paves the road for peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the negotiations on Hebron, Mazel said that the
Palestinians and Israelis continued their negotiations today to
implement the long overdue Israeli redeployment from the last West
Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is expected to be finalized within a day or two,
said the ambassador, but he added that the negotiations are
difficult to a certain extent.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the negotiations would not destroy ties
with Egypt, which is the first Arab state to make peace with the
Jewish state in 1979.
</P>
<P>
"Not every Palestinian-Israeli crisis should affect the ties as
the peace between the two countries is the cornerstone in the
region," said Mazel, who called for strenuous efforts to maintain
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The talks also tackled the problem of halting the bus line
linking Egypt and Israel due to the small number of passengers, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Israel was intent on working together with the Egyptian
Foreign Ministry and other concerned ministries to surmount these
problems, he said following the talks with Political Advisor to the
Egyptian Foreign Minister Nabil Fahmy and Head of Israel
Department at the Foreign Ministry Farouk Ghoneim.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Agida company decided to suspend its bus trips to and
from Egypt which has operated for the past 15 years. It lost 1,000
dollars on every trip, when the number of passengers never exceed
10 on each run.
</P>
<P>
The last Tel Aviv-Cairo trip is due back to Israel today. It
started in 1982, three years after Egypt and Israel signed the peace
treaty.
</P>
<P>
Contacts are underway between Agida and the Israeli Ministry of
Transport for reaching an agreement or entrusting another firm to
operate a bus line between the two countries, according to the
Egyptian MENA news agency.

Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before the weekly cabinet meeting today,
Michaelides said that "we would like international interest in
Cyprus to be concerted and as keen as possible to be effective."
</P>
<P>
Any contribution toward the peace effort is welcomed, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that some members of the U.N. Security Council, such
as the U.S. and Britain, may be more effective than others. But,
he also pointed out that "this should not lead us to the
conclusion that others do not have a role to play."
</P>
<P>
U.N. Security Council members have played a leading role in
the approval of council resolutions on Cyprus and have a
responsibility to see these resolutions implemented, the minister
stressed.
</P>

The U.S. and the European Union were reported to launch
a new peace initiative on Cyprus early next year. The U.N.
Secretary-General's special representative for Cyprus Han Sun Joo

<HEADLINE> Israeli Government Defeats Non-confidence Motion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government today
easily defeated a non-confidence motion tabled by an extreme
right-wing opposition party which opposes the impending Hebron
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The non-confidence motion, presented to the Knesset
(Parliament) by the Moledet Party, was defeated in a vote of 47 in
favor, 2 against with with 34 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Most lawmakers from the major opposition parties Labor and
Meretz either abstained or were not present for the vote.
This meant their indirect support for the government, which
could be toppled if the Labor and Meretz, which owns a
combined 43 seats in the 120-member Knesset, voted against.
</P>
<P>
The current Likud government inherited the buck of Israeli
troop redeployment in Hebron from the previous Labor-Meretz
coalition. The extreme right-wing Moledet party denounced the
Hebron deal as endangering the Jewish presence in the city.
</P>
<P>
Labor Knesset Member Haggi Merom explained the Labor's move in
the vote. "In one way, we did not want to give support to those
who are against the Hebron agreement, on the other hand we did
not give full support to those people who we don't trust that
they will implement every detail in the agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
But, in a sign showing the deep crack among the right-wing
Likud coalition, four cabinet members also abstained in the
vote. They included Education Minister Zevulun Hammer, Agriculture
Minister Rafael Eitan and National Infrastructure Minister Ariel
Sharon.
</P>
<P>
The religious camp protested against the Hebron deal, saying it
was tantamount to abandoning the Jewish communities in the
volatile West Bank city. There are 450 settlers living among
200,000 Palestinians in the city.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister David Levy failed to persuade the Moledet
Party to withdraw the non-confidence motion before the voting
began. He promised to present the Hebron deal to the cabinet
and the Knesset for approval after its signing with the
Palestinian Authority (PA).
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Likud faction meeting today, Netanyahu tried
to convince his party colleagues that the impending Hebron
deal was a better one than the original copy signed by the
Labor government.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu cited several specific clauses in the agreement to
support his claim, such as Israel will retain security control
in the high grounds around the Jewish neighborhood and Jews
will not be within the fire range of the Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
The Hebron agreement is expected to be reached Tuesday as the
two sides today geared up the last-minute talks. Officials said a
summit between Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
could take place Tuesday to sign the long-delayed agreement.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords, Israeli troops should have pulled back
from 80 percent of Hebron, but the previous labor government
delayed the pullback in early March after a wave of suicide
bombing attacks launched by Islamic militants from late February
to early March, which killed 58 people in Israel.

<HEADLINE> UK Must Avoid Single Currency: IoD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 30 (Xinhua) -- A new government must ensure
that the UK does not join up to a single European currency, the
Institute of Directors (IoD) warned today.
</P>
<P>
In his new year message to the 37,000 British members of the
IoD, Director General Tim Melville-Ross said that 1997 will be a
momentous year for the country as vitally important decisions
concerning its future in Europe will be taken.
</P>
<P>
He warned, "A decision to join the single currency in 1997 or
at any other time in the foreseeable future would so constrain our
economic freedom as to make it virtually impossible for us to
compete successfully."
</P>
<P>
"We must continue to pursue our own independent economic policy
within the single market," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also urged encouragement of free markets and less state
interference to foster the enterprise economy, but staying out of
the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty.
</P>
<P>
"Ending our opt-out from the social chapter would give our
partners the opportunity to impose additional labor costs on us.
This must mean higher unemployment, the last thing we need," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Keep Business Issues at Top of Election Agenda: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 30 (Xinhua) -- British business can look
forward to a prosperous l997, Colin Marshall, president of the
Confederation of British Industry (CBI), said here today.
</P>
<P>
In a new year message to CBI members, Colin said that the UK is
on course for steady growth over the next two years. "The economy
is in robust shape as we approach 1997 and our performance is much
admired by other countries."
</P>
<P>
He expected growth of just over 3 percent reinforced by
increases in consumer spending. And while export markets remain
very competitive due to the current level of sterling, there are
opportunities in the home market for firms to build on their
successes of 1996, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Colin warned business against letting the general
election blow them off course. "We are already in the throes of a
fiercely fought general election campaign which will only
intensify over the next few months," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The CBI is committed to making sure that the issues affecting
business remain top of the election agenda," Colin said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that whichever party emerged victorious, they must
know they cannot afford to rock the economic boat. Stability must
be the watchword of the next government, he added.
</P>
<P>
Colin said, "The role of government is to provide industry with
the means to create jobs, build wealth and achieve competitive
success for Britain."
</P>
<P>
"With the right climate of economic stability, sensible
regulation and a flexible labor market, British business can
continue to invest in jobs and training throughout 1997," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Europe policy which is the other issue likely
to dominate next year's agenda, in particular, a decision on the
Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), Colin said, "The government's
present policy of keeping our option open on EMU is the right one
for Britain."
</P>
<P>
Over the next 12 months it will become clearer whether this
would be the right path to follow, he said. "But whether or not we
decide to join we must take our seat at the negotiating table," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Takeovers Account for 60 Pct of Inward Investment in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 30 (Xinhua) -- More than half of all inward
investment in Britain last year was due to British companies being
acquired by foreign investors, Britain's main opposition Labor
Party said today.
</P>
<P>
Accusing the government of "deceit" over its record on inward
investment, Labor's employment spokesman Stephen Byers said that
the record was distorted by the inclusion of capital invested in
British companies in foreign takeovers.
</P>
<P>
Figures published by Labor showed that 60 percent of the inflow
of foreign capital in 1995 involved takeovers of British companies
and the figure was 43 percent in 1994 and 51 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Byers pointed out that it was not investment in new factories
creating additional jobs, as the government would have people
believe.
</P>
<P>
"The Tories constantly claim the UK attracts inward investment
because we have no minimum wage and have opted out of the social
chapter," he said. "These figures show that such claims are
misleading and are simply deceiving the British people."
</P>
<P>
And since the UK's social chapter opt-out was negotiated in
1992, takeovers as a percentage of inward investment had been
running at record levels, he added.

<P>
CAIRO, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and Foreign Minister Amr Moussa today held separate talks
with heads of Sudanese opposition parties, who arrived here
Friday on a few days' visit.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak today met with Mohamed Othman al-Merghani, leader of
the Sudanese Democratic Alliance which groups Sudanese opposition
parties in exile.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the opposition Umma Party Sadek el-Mahdi, who is
here for a ten-day visit at the first leg of his three-month Arab
and European tour, met with Moussa today.
</P>
<P>
Mahdi said after the meeting that he expounded to the Egyptian
top diplomat the target of this tour and the difficult
circumstances in Sudan, the Egyptian MENA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Mahdi slipped out of Khartoum to Eritrea, the
base of Sudanese opposition operations against Sudanese
government led by President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, who ousted
Mahdi in a bloodless coup in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has accused Sudan of having orchestrated the 1995 failed
attempt on the life of the Egyptian President in Addis Ababa and
granting asylum to Egyptian extremists. The two neighbors have
been at odds also over a territorial dispute and over quotas of
the Nile water.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council
today deplored the refusal by Iraq to allow the UN Special
Commission (UNSCOM) to remove 130 missile engines from Iraq for
analysis.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by Council President Francesco Paolo
Fulci of Italy, the Security Council reaffirmed that a full
accounting for Iraq's missiles with a range of greater than 150
kilometers was a necessary prerequisite to enable the Special
Commission to report that Iraq had complied with the
requirements of Section C of Resolution 687 (1991).
</P>
<P>
The council fully supported the intention of the UNSCOM to
carry out thoroughly the examination and analysis in the missile
area, either on the basis of dispatching international teams of
experts to Iraq or examining the relevant items abroad, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The council affirmed that Iraq was required to allow the UNSCOM
to remove the missile engines from its territory.
</P>
<P>
The council also reaffirmed the right and privileges of the
UNSCOM as stated in its previous relevant resolutions.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot police has arrested
a 23-year-old Lebanese man who threatened to strike French
interests in Cyprus unless 2 million U.S. dollars was paid to an
extremist organization, Ansar Al Haq (supporters of rights).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here today, a police spokesman
said Nasr Mohamad Hussein was arrested red-handed last Friday in
the southern coastal town of Limassol, when making the
threatening call to the French embassy in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The man, working as a waiter in Limassol, was said to set
December 31 as a deadline for the payment of two million dollars
for Ansar Al Haq, a Lebanon-based organization.
</P>
<P>
Police are now carrying out investigations in Cyprus and
abroad in connection with Hussein's links to the organization.
</P>
<P>
The French embassy in Cyprus has already been notified about
the arrest and efforts are being made to locate his
collaborators, believed to be in Cyprus since 1994, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
According to the police, Hussein was trained in various Arab
nations to carry out terrorist actions and is believed to have
received instructions from the organization's purported leader
Sheik Ali.

<HEADLINE> France's Unemployment Aggravates in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment aggravated in
France in November during which month the country's jobless people
increased by 20,700, or 0.7 percent, as compared with October,
according to a report published today by the Ministry of Labor.
</P>
<P>
The number of unemployed people in France stood at 3,121,500 by
the end of November, and the unemployment rate was 12.7 percent
according to the International Bureau of Labor.
</P>
<P>
France's jobless people increased by 39,500 in August, jumped
by 27,700 in September, and dropped by 12,000 in October.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that after a brief bright spell of the job market,
the rebound of the unemployment rate means that the French job
market stays ill-oriented.
</P>
<P>
When compared with the end of November 1995, the jobless people
in France increased by 147,700 in a one-year period of time.
</P>
<P>
Both France and Germany, the two advocators of the European
single currency, are haunted by unemployment as both are carrying
out an austerity budgetary policy and a high interest rate
monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have about 40 percent of the 18 million
jobless people in the 15 European Union countries.

<HEADLINE> Egypt More Upbeat About Damascus Declaration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said today "signs of good health" have started to appear
on the Damascus Declaration, casting off his gloomy estimate of
the eight-member alliance.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether he changed his previous opinion that the
Damascus Declaration was dying, the foreign minister said that
signs of health emanate from the development in the Arab stand,
as crystalized in the Cairo Arab Summit held in June and in
improved Arab action.
</P>
<P>
"Coordination and common Arab action under the frame of the
Damascus Declaration have become more effective and active,"
Moussa said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said the Declaration provides a frame for
Arab coordination and channels for inter-Arab economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
At their 14th meeting just ended Sunday, foreign ministers of
Damascus Declaration signatories agreed to enhance economic and
technological ties and follow up a number of prospective economic
projects, approved at the previous meeting in Oman.
</P>
<P>
"The outlook has changed and it is not possible to take up a
project or two during each meeting to feel that something is
going on," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Calling the grouping primarily a frame for coordination and
consultation, he stressed that the declaration can create an
environment for common Arab interests.
</P>
<P>
Moussa expressed hope that the 1997 could see the burgeoning
of just and balanced peace after the cooperation of the parties
concerned and negotiations on the basis of the land-for-peace
formula.
</P>
<P>
"It will be an important year for the whole region if it
brings about peace that involves and benefits all parties by
returning the rights of each party without discrimination along
with a feeling of security," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
On the Arab level, he expected to see more expansive
coordination, amid the positive atmosphere and within the
mechanisms founded in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Top diplomats from Egypt, Syria and the six members of the
Gulf Cooperation Council -- Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman -- probed means of
achieving stability in the region and pledged Arab coordination
to face "challenges that worry all the Arabs."
</P>
<P>
The alliance, formed in the Syrian capital in 1991 following
the second Gulf War during which Iraqi troops were forced to pull
out of Kuwait, calls for joint security and military arrangements
in addition to economic cooperation among the eight signatories.

UNITED NATIONS, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng
said that the Chinese Government highly appreciated UN
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's positive role and
unremitting efforts during his term of office.
</P>
<P>
In a letter replying to Boutros-Ghali's letter dated on
December 18, Li expressed thanks to the secretary-general for the
important work that he has done in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The letter was transmitted today by Qin Huasun, Chinese
Permanent Representative to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Li Pend said that the Chinese Government highly appreciated the
positive role and efforts made by the first UN Secretary-General
from Africa in "maintaining world peace and security, enhancing
international cooperation and understanding and increasing the
role of the United Nations in the post-Cold War period with
abundant opportunities and challenges."
</P>
<P>
Praising him as an old friend of the Chinese people, Li said,
"the further strengthening and development of the good cooperative
relations between China and the United Nations over the past five
years is closely related to your personal active endeavor."
</P>
<P>
"I believe that you will continue to contribute to the
enhancement of the traditional friendship between China and
Egypt," he said.
</P>
<P>
Upon receiving the letter, Boutros-Ghali expressed appreciation
of China's role in the United Nations and the Security Council. He
said that he would further push forward the cooperation between
Egypt and China in various fields. He also expressed the hope to
visit China again.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali's term as UN secretary-general will expire on
December 31. Kofi Annan will succeed as the secretary-general from
January 1, 1997, for a five-year term.

<HEADLINE> 3 killed as Sudanese Military Chopper Downed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Three Sudanese soldiers on
board a military chopper were killed when their plane was shot
down by Eritrean anti-aircraft fire over the southern border of
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Middle East News Agency, citing a statement
released by the Sudanese armed forces, said today that Eritrean
anti-aircraft gunfire downed the helicopter while it was
patrolling the border.
</P>
<P>
All of the three soldiers aboard were killed, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place in eastern Sudan Saturday. No reason
was given for delaying the announcement.
</P>
<P>
Tension has been high on the Sudanese-Eritrean border for
about a month after the governor of Kassala province declared a
state of emergency, as the Sudanese authorities believed that the
attacks by the Sudanese opposition were backed by Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The National Democratic Alliance, a grouping of Sudanese
opposition parties, issued a military communique from Asmara,
Eritrea, saying its forces ambushed Sudanese government troops,
which resulted in killing 50 soldiers and wounding 120 others.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea broke off relations with Sudan in December 1994,
accusing Khartoum of sheltering rebels against Asmara.
</P>
<P>
Sudan, in turn, has accused Eritrea of helping southern
Sudanese militants who have been fighting since 1983 for more
autonomy in the south.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are business
briefs from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Major Japanese investors have entered the Amman
Financial Market (AFM) with a fund of more than six million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The "provident fund," considered one of the largest Japanese
funds, has ventured to by a number of Jordanian shares, after their
U.S. and British counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the amount of foreign investment was still
small. This can be attributed to the limited size of the market
and the small volume of shares -- foreign ownership is restricted
to a 50 percent ceiling.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Some 120,000 foreign workers' work permits in
Israel are due to expire Tuesday, because the Ministry of Labor
and Social Affairs will not agree to their renewal, Jerusalem
Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the Association of Contractors and Builders
as saying that the licenses were last extended in June, for
six months, one month before the licenses' original expiration
date.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry has not renewed foreign workers'
permits since November at the instruction of Labor and Social
Affairs Minister Eli Yishai, and as a result, almost all
workers in the construction and agriculture sectors will be
declared illegal.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The Finance Committee of the Knesset (Israel's
parliament) has approved a bill which will set definite limits for
the deficit in each of the next five years, Jerusalem Post
reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the bill, the 1997 deficit will have to be no
greater than 2.8 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP),
and the limit will then decrease to 2.4 percent in 1998,
2 percent in 1999, 1.75 percent in 2000 and 1.5 percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
These targets are considerably less ambitious than those
included in the original Deficit Reduction Law, passed by the
previous Likud government in 1992, which stipulated the deficit of
6.2 percent in 1992, 3.2 percent in 1993, 2.2 percent in 1994
and zero in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Labor bill stated that the deficit would be 3 percent in
1994 and would decrease by unspecified amounts in each of the
three following years, but, the deficit hit 3.2 percent in 1995
and is expected to be some 3.8 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- The world's top oil producer and exporter Saudi
Arabia saw in 1996 an economic surge to reach the highest level in
the past decade because of the sharp increase in oil prices and
growth in other sectors.
</P>
<P>
Banking and industry sources said that each one-dollar-barrel
change in oil prices translates into 2.5 billion U.S. dollars
annually -- up or down. Oil makes up 70 percent of the Saudi state
revenue.
</P>
<P>
With the average price of Saudi light and heavy crudes
reaching around 18.5 dollars a barrel in 1996, the kingdom's
economy is estimated to grow by around 6 percent to 132.5 billion
dollars compared with 125.06 billion dollars in 1995. The 1995
figure was a 4.3 percent increase on the basis of a negative
growth rate in 1994, according to official forecasts.
</P>
<P>
Economists predicted that oil earnings would exceed the
budgeted amount by between 6 billion and 10 billion dollars this
year, giving it hopes that its forecast 4.9 billion dollars
deficit on spending of the budgeted 40 billion dollars would
either be in balance or in surplus by the end of the year.

But the Palestinian official reaffirmed that Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat would stick to the peace accords and not
relinquish anything previously agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
Asked on his opinion of the U.S. diplomatic drive in the peace
process, he hoped that Madeleine Albright in her capacity as the
new secretary of state will work for implementing the agreements
that "Washington witnessed their signing in the White House."
</P>
<P>
He also urged Albright to assume a "fair" role for reaching a
peaceful and just solution although she "had some stances which
irked the Arabs."
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. is biased to Israel but we want it to be keen on the
future of Israel within peace and not within war and conflicts,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Shaath praised the role of Egypt that
insists on the Palestinians' rights.

<HEADLINE> Good Prospect of Economic Development between China, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Due to great efforts of both
sides, the economic relations between Yugoslavia and China has
witnessed a very dynamic development in 1996, President of
Yugoslav Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Mihailo Milojevic, said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Milojevic said there have been
frequent visits by Chinese economic delegations to Yugoslavia in
the past year and numerous Yugoslav businessmen have visited
China, with scores of contracts being signed on trade, joint
ventures, transfer of technology, etc.
</P>
<P>
"The development of economic cooperation is growing fast and
the prospect is very favorable for the next year in view of the
mutual interest in the expansion of business links between the two
countries."
</P>
<P>
He said the trade in 1996 has reached the value of more than
100 million U.S. dollars, which is comparatively low in comparison
with the far greater potentials.
</P>
<P>
In his view, there are no obstacles for the development of
bilateral economic relations between Yugoslavia and China apart
from geographical distance.
</P>
<P>
Talking about future economic cooperation, he said in addition
to the conventional trade, much more could be done to develop
other and advanced forms of economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In terms of cooperation fields, the commercial chamber
president named the following as examples: the metal complex, the
pharmaceutical industry, agriculture and food processing, and the
construction industry.
</P>
<P>
He particularly singled out the oil barter deal between the two
countries as of great importance to the bilateral trade
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The barter deal was signed early this year and Yugoslavia
bartered its mechanical and chemical products for the
320-million-dollar worth of Chinese oil. This barter arrangement
will allow Yugoslav enterprises to boost their output and
establish long-term cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
"The oil barter deal offers great opportunities for the
marketing of goods by numerous Yugoslav enterprises in China. This
deal is of great importance for our enterprises as it provides
easier access of our goods to China's huge market," Milojevic
said.
</P>
<P>
He also underlined that the lifting of the economic embargo
against Yugoslavia has offered great opportunities for the
promotion of his country's international economic cooperation, and
China will have a prominent position in this strategy.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-endorsed sanctions against Yugoslavia were formally
lifted on October 2 by the U.N. Security Council to reward
Belgrade's important role in the peaceful settlement of the
ex-Yugoslav crisis.
</P>
<P>
The senior economic official said that to make easier
communication with China, Yugoslav business community, including
the Yugoslav Chamber of Commerce, has established a fair number of
firms and economic representative offices in China.
</P>
<P>
"The Yugoslav Chamber of Commerce is in support of and engaged
in the promotion of economic cooperation through linking up the
businessmen and identifying projects for cooperation in the
Chinese and Yugoslav markets, and I am confident economic
relations will develop faster and reach a new level in the new
year," he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Won't Support Terrorism in Nigeria: Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States will not
engage in or sponsor any anti-government activities in Nigeria,
U.S. Ambassador to the west African country Walter Carrington
said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the News Agency of Nigeria, the ambassador
restated his country's condemnation of recent bomb blasts in
Lagos, the commercial center of Nigeria, stressing that the U. S.
government is opposed to acts of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
An explosion on December 16 morning rocked the convoy of
Lagos State Administrator Mohammed Marwa, seriously injuring three
persons and damaging a car.
</P>
<P>
A second blast near the State Secretariat Complex two days
later injured 16 people, mostly soldiers, on their way to work,
destroying a bus carrying soldiers of a task force on
environmental sanitation to work.
</P>
<P>
Following the first blast, the U.S. Embassy issued a statement
on the possibility of more explosions, warning Americans
worldwide who might wish to travel to Nigeria between then and
January 16, 1997 to exercise caution.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has expressed grave concern over the
statement, but the ambassador said it was only a usual advisory
notice to American citizens residing in Nigeria or those
preparing to travel to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Disturbed by the U. S. statement, Nigeria's Foreign Affairs
Ministry summoned Carrington to Abuja, capital of the country, on
December 24, protesting the statement.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ambassador, who refused to speak to the media after
the parley, said today he had "frank and fruitful" discussions
with ministry officials during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
But he did not elaborate.

<HEADLINE> Leading Economic Indicators up in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Index of Leading Economic
Indicators increased 0.1 percent, said the Conference Board, a New
York-based business research group.
</P>
<P>
The index's November reading of 102.6 compares with revised
October and September levels of 102.5. The index operates from a
base of 100, set in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The index is designed to forecast economic activity six to nine
months in advance.
</P>
<P>
The indicators rose for the 10th straight month, but November's
increase was less than the 0.2 percent economists expected.
</P>
<P>
Treasury bond prices, which often fall if economic statistics
show signs of an overheated economy and inflation, were mostly
unchanged following the release of the statistics. Stocks were up
slightly today.
</P>
<P>
Recent economic statistics have shown signs of weakness
including somewhat disappointing holiday sales and last week's
report of lower than expected durable goods orders.
</P>
<P>
November's leading indicators include revisions that deleted
two components -- sensitive materials prices and unfilled durable
goods orders. One component, measuring the difference between
10-year Treasury bond interest rates and the short-term federal
funds rate, was added.
</P>
<P>
Higher stock prices were the biggest contributor to the November
gain, followed by money supply, consumer expectations and building
permits. The new interest-rate component was the biggest drain on
the index.

<HEADLINE> Redgrave and Hill Have New Year Honours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Steven Redgrave and Damon Hill,
who had splendid performances in respective sports in 1996, earned
top awards in the New Year Honours List.
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old Redgrave became Britain's most celebrated
Olympic performer when he won his fourth successive rowing gold
medal in Atlanta. He was honoured with a CBE to add to the MBE he
already earned in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Hill, the first motor racing son to emulate his
world-championship winning father Graham when he landed the
Formula One title in Japan in October, is honoured with the OBE.
</P>
<P>
But while Britain's sublime performers of 1996 pick up deserved
awards, the most prestigious sporting honour goes to former
England Test cricketer Alec Bedser who receives a Knighthood for
his services to the game as a player and administrator.
</P>
<P>
Bedser was the only bowler to dismiss the great Don Bradman
twice for no score. He also claimed the Aussie batting legend's
wicket in five successive Test innings and took 236 wickets in 51
Tests as well as serving his beloved Surrey from 1939-60.
</P>
<P>
He received the OBE in 1964 and the CBE in 1982 after managing
three England tours and was Chairman of Selectors for a record 13
years until 1981. Now at 78 he joins his former Test captain Sir
Leonard Hutton and Sir Colin Cowdrey in receiving the ultimate
accolade.
</P>
<P>
Another cricketer to be honoured is Ossie Wheatley, the
61-year-old former Warwickshire and Glamorgan bowler who became a
top administrator as chairman of the TCCB cricket committee and is
now chairman of the Sports Council for Wales. He receives a CBE.
</P>
<P>
In a year in which "football came home" in a blaze of Wembley
sunshine the success of Euro 96 also features in the roll of
honour.
</P>
<P>
There is an MBE for Arsenal's 33-year-old goalkeeper David
Seaman, whose penalty saves against Scotland and in the shoot-out
against Spain were crucial in taking England through to the
semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Glen Kirton, the tournament director whose organisation ensured
a trouble-free competition, is awarded the OBE.
</P>
<P>
There is also an MBE for Celtic's veteran captain Paul McStay,
who missed Scotland's European Championship campaign because of an
ankle operation.
</P>
<P>
The world of rugby is represented by prolific try-scoring
winger Martin Offiah, who became the first player to be owned
jointly by a rugby union and rugby league club when he moved in an
historic transfer from Wigan to the London Broncos and Bedford in
the summer.
</P>
<P>
Offiah, Rugby League's top try scorer for a record six seasons
since turning professional with Widnes in June 1987 and who has
scored 26 tries in 33 Tests for Great Britain, receives the MBE.

<HEADLINE> Inter's Ince Banned for Four Matches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Internazionale and England
midfielder Paul Ince got a four-match ban on monday for protesting
with foul language and abusive gestures after he was sent off in
an Italian league match.
</P>
<P>
Ince, picking up his third red card of the season, was sent off
during Inter's 1-1 draw with bottom club Reggiana on December 22
after being booked by referee Stefano Farina.
</P>
<P>
The serie A sporting judge said in a report, details of which
were released by the Italian soccer league, that Ince had been
given the ban because of his behaviour.
</P>
<P>
The report said Ince had applauded the referee mockingly after
being booked, a gesture that brought him a red card and which
prompted "vulgar and offensive language".
</P>
<P>
It added that Ince, encouraged to leave the pitch by his team
mates, then repeatedly tapped his forehead with his index finger
in front of another match official.
</P>
<P>
The player also "shouted further abuse while making an
unmistakeable gesture with his hand" from the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
Inter striker Marco Branca, who was sent off in the 30th minute
of the match, was also suspended for one day -- leaving Inter
without two key players for their first league match of the New
Year at home to Roma, Branca's former club.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, December 31 (Xinhua)-- The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region has vowed to further promote its opening-up drive in the
coming five years, according to Zhang Wenxue, vice chairman of the
regional government.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi will use seven billion US dollars of overseas
investment by the turn of the century, higher than the country's
average rate, and export three billion US dollars worth of goods,
higher than its GNP average.
</P>
<P>
Progress will be made in helping diverting overseas investment
to agriculture, state enterprise modernization and major capital
construction projects.
</P>
<P>
The region will expand its open areas, which presently account
for eight percent of the area's total territory, to more than 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi borders on Vietnam and Guangdong Province, and is close
to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 33 established development zones, the region
will set up a bonded zone in Beihai, one of China's 14 open
coastal cities, and an economic and technology development zone in
Nanning, the regional capital.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that Guangxi has more than 7,000
overseas-funded enterprises, and actually used 3.36 billion US
dollars of overseas investment.

<HEADLINE> Light Shed on Unknown Origin of Caves of Mogao Grottos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, December 31 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 caves in the
world-renowned Mogao Grottos, whose original uses have puzzled
experts for decades, have turned out to be residences for Buddhist
monks.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the caves, now believed to have been used as
living rooms and study rooms, or as burial grounds for the monks,
suggests that the site was once a haven of Buddhist monks in the
Gobi Desert, according to Chinese archaeologists.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of caves were carved in the steep face of a 1,600-m
cliff in Dunhuang in northwest China's Gansu Province between the
4th to the 14th Century.
</P>
<P>
Only two-thirds of them, which are located in the southern part
of the cliff, are open to the public and contain over 2,000
painted statues and 45,000 sq m of murals.
</P>
<P>
But that's not all.
</P>
<P>
In the past eight years, archaeologists from the Dunhuang
Research Institute have excavated some 250 of the unexplored caves
in the northern part of cliff and found a great number of
documents in different languages, Persian silver coins, fabric,
pottery, porcelain, lacquer items, statues, and murals.
</P>
<P>
In abundance are kangs (heatable brick beds), stoves,
granaries, and coffins.
</P>
<P>
Peng Jinzhang, a research fellow with the Institute of Dunhuang
who was in charge of the excavation, says that the caves with both
a kang and a stove were used as living rooms, those with a kang
but without a stove were used for meditation, while those with a
body inside a coffin were burial rooms.
</P>
<P>
The 18 burial caves each cover an area of three to six square
meters and were sealed with soil or stones. They are the first of
their kind ever found in the area.
</P>
<P>
Multi-functional caves, serving as both granaries and a spots
for meditation, have also been found in the northern part of the
cliff.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary studies of the newly-found relics have shown that
Buddhism spread rapidly in China during the Sui Dynasty (589-618),
result in an influx of monks to Mogao.
</P>
<P>
The small caves built earlier in the southern part of the cliff
could not accommodate the monks, so new caves were dug in the then
spacious northern part.
</P>
<P>
Later, all the monks moved to the northern part and redesigned
their residences in the southern part to be more suited for
worship services or holding Buddhist rites, similar to other caves
in the southern part.
</P>
<P>
More caves are expected to be uncovered as part of the study of
the northern caves, which have been listed among the country's
major projects in the social sciences in the 1995-2000 period.

<P>
SHANGHAI, December 31 (Xinhua) -- A quarter of the foreign
banks operating in Shanghai are eagerly awaiting a final decision
from China's central bank, announcing whether they can start RMB
business in the city's Pudong New Area.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the central bank's local branch said that about
10 foreign banks have applied to the bank for access to start the
business, and the bank has worked out appropriate rules for the
foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
According to the rules, foreign banks wanting to start RMS
business should move their Shanghai branches to the Pudong New
Area, and open offices in the Puxi Area in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 office buildings have been built in the area, which the
foreign banks now can move into.
</P>
<P>
Their clients can only be foreign-funded enterprises registered
in the city, and they should open RMB accounts in the central
bank's Shanghai branch, and deliver reserved funds for attracting
deposits from their local customers.
</P>
<P>
But their income tax rate will remain the same, 15 percent as
before, and the central bank's Shanghai branch will provide a
training programs for employees of the foreign banks in RMB
business dealings.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese stock market is
back on track after its recent sharp plunge and is set for steady
growth, according to securities officials and experts here.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to the recent timely and drastic market-cooling
measures of the financial authorities, the market bubble is being
squeezed out gradually, paving the way for healthier growth," Lin
Zhiyuan, a financial expert with the Banking and Finance Institute
of the People's Bank of China, the central bank, told Xinhua News
Agency in an interview Monday.
</P>
<P>
Driven by excessive speculation, the stock market began to
overheat in October. The Shenzhen Composite Index skyrocketed 340
percent and the Shanghai Composite Index roared by 120 percent
between April 1 and December 9, when the two indices hit 4,522 and
1,258, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Chinese rushed to buy stocks, hoping for
overnight fortunes, but their bubbles burst when the market fell
by the limit of ten percent for two days, following the
publication of a commentary in China's official "People's Daily"
warning of the risks of excessive speculation.
</P>
<P>
"It seemed that the market plummeted because of the official
commentary, but the correction is bound to set in as investors
regain their rationale in investing," said Lin Zhiyuan.
</P>
<P>
Ted Tokuchi, chief representative of Daiwa Securities Company's
Beijing office, said that the strong upward trend of China's stock
market since October was not without economic support, but it did
not stray greatly from the actual economic condition.
</P>
<P>
"In view of a complete stock market cycle, it's inevitable for
the stock market to come back on track and be more reflective of
the economy," he said.

<P>
Statistics show that the prices of most third-line stocks lost
more than 50 percent during the past two weeks, while the blue
chips were able to resist the dive and rebound more quickly.
</P>
<P>
The market has almost recovered after the sharp downward
correction, with the stock indices back to the level in early
October and average daily turnover at a normal amount of 4.7
billion yuan and 5.4 billion yuan in Shanghai and Shenzhen,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that the number of stock investors
continued to grow during the past two weeks, up by 290,000 between
December 16-24.
</P>
<P>
"All these factors are clear indications that the market has
gradually cooled down, and Chinese stock investors continue to
view the market as an important investment channel and hold full
confidence in its prospects," said an official of the China
Securities Regulatory Commission.
</P>
<P>
Echoing the official, Ted Tokuchi said that the Chinese stock
market is tipped for healthier growth now that stock prices are
more reflective of the performance of the listed companies, stock
investors have become more rational in their purchases, and the
prospects of the national economy are expected to be good.
</P>
<P>
A securities official at the State Planning Commission noted
that China's stock market is set to see an accelerated expansion
in the near future, pointing to the fact that it is China's
long-term goal to seek a more developed securities market.
</P>
<P>
China will issue ten billion yuan of new shares in 1996, almost
double the amount for 1995, according to an official announcement
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
By December 25, a total of 524 Chinese companies had listed in
the stock market, issuing nearly 110 billion yuan-worth of shares,
34 billion yuan of them tradable. More than 21 million Chinese
are investing in stocks.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: New Progress in Sino-Western European Ties in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The past year has witnessed
noticeable progress in Sino-Western European friendly and
cooperative ties, which will contribute greatly to the long-term
steady relations between China and the European countries as the
21st century draws near.
</P>
<P>
The high-level exchange of visits and cooperation in various
fields between China and western European countries have been more
frequent than in previous years, particularly the trips to Western
European countries by prominent Chinese leaders as Jiang Zemin, Li
Peng, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji and Liu Huaqing,
</P>
<P>
And a number of China tours were made by heads of state from
Germany, Switzerland and Finland, as well as the Austrian
Chancellor, and the Prime Ministers from Luxembourg and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
These visits are also highly significant to the healthy
development of the international situation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, political dialogue and consultations between the two
sides have been strengthened, creating sound conditions for the
economic and trade cooperation, which continues to grow.
</P>
<P>
There has been steady development in scientific and
technological, cultural and educational fields.
</P>
<P>
The Asia-Europe meeting (ASEM) held in Bangkok last March was a
grand-scale gathering of historical importance, as it worked to
establish a new Asian-Euro partnership to face the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, leaders of 25 countries discussed their
future cooperation on equal footing. Chinese Premier Li Peng
proposed that the new partnership should have several
distinguishing characteristics, namely, that both sides will
respect and treat one another as equals, seek common ground while
reserving differences and draw upon one another's experience,
enhance mutual understanding and trust, seek mutual benefit, look
toward the future and work for common development.
</P>
<P>
The ASEM and its follow-up actions have laid a solid foundation
for the advancement of Sino-Euro relations, especially the ties
between China and the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The development of China needs cooperation with EU, and the EU,
in turn, needs an increasingly powerful China, in particular its
potentially powerful market.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission approved a long-term policy for China last
year, and adopted a new EU Strategy towards China in November
which is more specific and further stresses its overall,
independent and long-range plans.
</P>
<P>
This has expressed the desire of the EU Commission to improve
with China its cooperation in the economy, trade, science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
1996 is a fruitful year for relations between China and the EU,
according to the delegation of EU to China, as bilateral
cooperation in economic and development fields reached a new high.
</P>
<P>
The EU is an important trade partner of China, and in general,
bilateral economic and trade relations have enjoyed a positive
trend of development.
</P>
<P>
According to China's customs statistics, the trade volume
between China and the 15 EU members from this January to November
stood at 33.58 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Predictions hold that the annual trade volume in 1996 is likely
to be equal to or exceed the 1995 figure, which was 40.34 billion
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the number of investment items of the EU to China
have continuously increased. By the end of September, the
EU-funded projects in China had reached 7,107, and were valued at
25.77 billion US dollars with actual investment of 7.91 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that the EU will adopt more open measures and
cancel its trade protectionism measures on China's export
products, to ensure the even greater advancement in trade between
China and the EU.

<HEADLINE> Austrian Official Expects No Change in Hong Kong after </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- An Austrian official said today
that he believed the economy of Hong Kong region will not undergo
any significant changes after it returns to Chinese sovereignty on
July 1 next year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the city's role as a "door to Chinese market" may be
played in a greater way, the Austria Press Agency (APA) quoted
Alfred Mayer, Austria's commercial representative to Hong Kong, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong provides more investment opportunities in its
infrastructure construction, such as the projects of the new
airport, the new exhibition and conference center and the
extension of its container harbor, that are under way or planned
to be built.
</P>
<P>
All these demonstrate that Hong Kong will remain a regional
center of finance, trade and economy, Mayer said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Hong Kong's status as a special economic zone is
also set in the Sino-British agreement and will not change in 50
years.
</P>
<P>
Mayer hailed the close trade relations between Austria and Hong
Kong region, saying Austria has started up 10 joint ventures in
Hong Kong and southern China.
</P>
<P>
He believed that Hong Kong will attract more foreign
investment, especially in automatic production.
</P>
<P>
The investment opportunities for Austria in Hong Kong and
southern China will be in the fileds of environmental protection
techniques and video facilities, he said.

<HEADLINE> Top 10 Medical Stories Highlight Successes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Achievements on viral
hepatitis and associated illnesses were listed among the top 10
national news stories in the fields of medical science and
technology for 1996, the Ministry of Public Health announced
yesterday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Chinese researchers have completed gene testing on hepatitis G
and the information has been registered at the US Gene Data Bank
this year, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chinese scientists have succeeded in developing a
vaccine to combat hepatitis B, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
National surveillance since 1986 has demonstrated that about 90
percent of the vaccines tested remained effective for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The top 10 news were selected by officials and experts from
eight State departments and associations including the Ministry of
Public Health, the Health Division of the General Logistics
Department of the People's Liberation Army, the State Science and
Technology Commission, the State Pharmaceutical Administration,
the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the
Chinese Association of Science and Technology, the Chinese Medical
Society and the Beijing-based Health News.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jieping, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC), was invited to participate as an
adviser to the selection, while Health Minister Chen Minzhang was
asked to be the president.
</P>
<P>
The growth of available talents in the medical science and
technology field occupied the top of the best 10 list.
</P>
<P>
A total of 20 medical experts were selected as Chinese
academicians of engineering in May, while another 107 researchers
under 45 years of age were named stars of medical science and
technology in October.
</P>
<P>
The success of the 31st International Congress on Military
Medicine in October, the first of its kind in China, which
attracted military medical experts from 103 countries, was the
second big news story.
</P>
<P>
Another "top 10" news story is that the Chinese Institute for
Biological Products Testing has stipulated limits on heavy metal
trace elements in 13 kinds of export-oriented non-prescription
traditional Chinese medicines, thus laying a foundation for
Chinese traditional medicine to enter the world market.
</P>
<P>
In another story, a five-year study conducted by Zhejiang
Medical University detected two new genes that could be the cause
of colon cancers.

<HEADLINE> Over 300 Killed in Assam Train Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 31 (Xinhua) -- At least 300 people were
feared killed and many others injured when a powerful bomb,
suspected to have been planted by extremists, blew up three
crowded coaches of a Delhi-bound train Monday night, the local
press said here today.
</P>
<P>
The station master of the Kokrajhar Railway Station in the
extremist- dominated Kokrajhar District of Assam State, eastern
India, heard a loud explosion just as the train left the station.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted a senior railway official as saying the
impact of the blast was so intense that it also derailed the
engine and two other coaches of the train.
</P>
<P>
The accident site presented a gruesome picture with blood
splashes and dismembered bodies of the victims spreading all
around.
</P>
<P>
Railway police and civil administration officials were
conducting rescue and relief operations.
</P>
<P>
It was suspected that the bomb was planted somewhere near
Kokrajhar by Bodo extremists who have been fighting for an
independent Bodoland within Assam State.
</P>
<P>
Condemning the bombing, Assam State Chief Minister Prafullah
Kumar Ahanta said violence would not solve any problem.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Crime Statistics Rosy, But Reality Not so Great </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Crime has statistically
declined throughout Russia, but the outgoing year seems to have
been an unusually active one for the nation's criminal world.
</P>
<P>
The first ten months of 1996 saw a total of 2,213,424 crimes
reported in Russia, or 4.4 percent less than the same period in
1995.
</P>
<P>
An especially significant drop was noted in the overall number
of serious crimes such as murders and armed robberies which, with
a total of 712,661 cases by November 1, were down a full 10
percent. That figure is highlighted by a 6.4 percent fall in
murders, down to 18,517 cases.
</P>
<P>
The police have shown significant results, solving almost 77
percent of the murders, 63.5 percent of the armed robberies, and
81.6 percent of weapons thefts registered with police to the end
of October. Their investigations have been successful in 71
percent of all cases this year, or up 6.8 percent over 1995.
</P>
<P>
But this overall improvement contrasts sharply with their
failure to tackle contract killings. Only 60 of 560 such murders
committed in the first ten months of this year have been resolved.
</P>
<P>
Moscow, in particular, retained its status as the criminal
capital with 59 assassinations carried out in the city, including
the widely publicized murder of businessman Paul Tatum. Only 19
of these have been solved so far.
</P>
<P>
In general, the murder rate in Moscow, home to some 10 million
people, is higher than in New York. In spite of such a dubious
honor, Moscow this year noted a small decline in the homicide
rate. Compared to 1995, with a total of 1,569 murders, by the end
of November police had registered just 1,435 killings.
</P>
<P>
Despite the small drop, recent opinion polls indicate that the
majority of Muscovites, as well as citizens throughout the nation,
still list crime as one of their top three concerns.
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin has urged government security bodies to respond to
the challenge and make a maximum effort to fight all kinds of
crime, particularly organized crime, in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Panama to Promote Economic Relations with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Panama's Foreign Ministry
today emphasizes the importance of Panama opening up economic
relations with China.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry spokesman told the local press that the
heightened importance given economic relations "was the result of
a process of intense negotiations that took place between the two
countries" which would result in closer commercial ties.
</P>
<P>
Panama and China have an annual trade amounting to 600 million
U.S. dollars. The exchange includes electrical products, tools,
textiles and toys. The two countries also established trade
offices in each others' capitals in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The duty-free zone of Colon, on the Atlantic side of the Panama
Canal, considered the biggest in Latin America, receives more than
1.2 billion dollars a year of products manufactured in China.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also emphasized China's status as the third most
important client of the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that with China's restoration of
sovereignty over Hong Kong in July 1997, China would become more
important to Panama.
</P>
<P>
This was because Panama had a fluid trade relationship with
Hong Kong which was of vital importance for its economy.

<P>
MOSCOW, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
hopes that all Russians will work hard for a flourishing Russia in
the coming year.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president called on everyone, no matter which party
they belong to, to work hard for a strong and prosperous Russia,
and all officials should cooperate to this goal.
</P>
<P>
"We are to work a lot and jointly next year," said Yeltsin in a
traditional New Year speech at a reception in the Kremlin Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin wished that 1997 would be a year of peace, accord and
cooperation for all Russians. He said the year 1996 was "difficult
and tense."
</P>
<P>
"We met 1996 with anxiety and with hope, and our hopes have
come true," he said. "I am sure this road will inevitably lead us
to prosperity and to a strong Russia."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with leading Russian news agencies --
Itar-Tass, Interfax and RIA Novosti -- earlier on Monday, Yeltsin
said he was "ready to begin looking for the solution to the most
complicated problems facing Russia" in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Concord and reconciliation is the task for next year, but
specific actions for the good of the people are the most important
of all, said the president.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Sees More Foreign Tourist Arrivals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- More than 5 million foreign
tourists are expected to have visited Indonesia this year and they
should have spent about 6.18 billion U.S. dollars, a senior
official said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Tourism, Post and Telecommunications Joop Ave said
here on Monday that the number of foreign tourists this year is
18.4 percent higher than last year.
</P>
<P>
The money foreign tourists spent in the country is also about
16.9 percent more than last year, the minister was quoted today by
the local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government had initially projected that the number of
foreign tourists would be between 4.78 million and 5.05 million
while their expenditure would be between 6.57 billion and 6.94
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The amount of foreign exchange earned from the tourism sector
will rank third after oil and gas exports and the textile and
garment sector," he added.
</P>
<P>
The government expects the tourism industry to become the
country's biggest foreign exchange earner by the end of the
seventh five-year development plan period in 2004.
</P>
<P>
The minister attributed the achievement to cooperation between
the government, the private sector and the press.

BUENOS AIRES, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The federal police in
Argentina have arrested four people, including a Russian, seizing
from them counterfeit bills of 2.5 million U.S. dollars, local
press reported today.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Austrian Chancellor Rules out Quick EU Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) is not
likely to expand soon since only qualified nations can be allowed
to entry the bloc, says the Federal Chancellor of Austria, Franz
Vranitzky.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a local daily, Die Presse, Vranitzky said
the 15-member bloc should not rush into enlargement.
</P>
<P>
He urged those European countries that intended to join the
Union to develop their economies, and suggested they first broaden
their economic cooperation with the EU.
</P>
<P>
As EU's 15 member states are busying themselves with lowering
budget deficits to three percent of the gross domestic product
(GDP) before the single currency deadline of January 1999, a
criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, the EU appears to have no
time to consider the entry of new states.
</P>
<P>
In view of this, Vranitzky suggested these states be
patient. He gave the examples of Spain and Portugal who took 10
years to join the then European Community because they could not
initially meet the requirements.

<HEADLINE> Factions of Nepal's RPP Party Close to Reconciliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Two factions of Nepal's
second ruling partner the National Democratic Party (RPP) are
close to a reconciliation after they took contrary stands over an
opposition challenge against the three-party government, the
Kathmandu Post said today.
</P>
<P>
The two factions, led by RPP President Surya Bahadur Thapa and
parliamentary leader Lokendra Bahadur Chand respectively, are
eager to come together as a formal split of the party would be
suicidal to both of them, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The RPP has virtually split when the Chand faction including
Nine RPP MPs in the lower house last week voted in favor of a
no-trust motion against the coalition government led by Sher
Bahadur Deuba of the Nepali Congress (NC). The remaining of the
party's 19 MPs either voted against it or abstained from the house
voting.
</P>
<P>
The censure motion, tabled by the main opposition Communist
Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML), was narrowly
rejected by the 205-seat house with 101 MPs voting for it, two
votes less than the required majority of 103 for its passage.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML earlier had offered to form a new ruling coalition
led by the RPP with its parliamentary leader Chand as prime
minister if the present government was ousted through the motion.
</P>
<P>
With its 19 seats in the house, The RPP holds the key to any
political equation in the country as each of the main ruling NC
and Main opposition CPN-UML, with 86 and 88 seats, could not form
a majority government without its support.
</P>
<P>
The change in the political equation is a secondary issue until
the differences in the party are resolved, a party spokesman
quoted by the paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The sudden change in attitude of leaders of the two RPP
factions from confrontation to compromise was attributed to their
fears of a possible dissolution of the lower house and call for
mid-term elections by Prime Minister Deuba, whose government only
has minority parliamentary support after the opposition challenge,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 84 MPs voted against the opposition sponsored
no-trust motion in last week's house voting.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Relaxes Circuit Breaker in Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), Bangladesh's regulatory body of capital market,
has decided to relax the circuit breaker to 10 percent from the
existing five percent, effective from January 1, stock sources
said here today.
</P>
<P>
In another move, the government removed two members of the SEC
and appointed two academicians as the new members.
</P>
<P>
The decision to widen the circuit breaker on price fluctuation
was taken to help raise the volume of trading in the bourses which
had been witnessing a slurring business in the past fortnight
following last month's upheaval in the market, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
It is also likely to free some shares which remained log-jammed
at high prices at the height of the bull run in October.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the SEC relaxed the circuit breaker for post book
closure issues to ease the pressure on the market.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the latest decision of the SEC, chairman of the
Dhaka Stock Exchange Imtiyaz Hossain said it will restore
confidence of investors and help normalize trading.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on the last trading day of an eventful year for the
Dhaka Stock Exchange, the composite share price index registered a
marginal rise of 38.67 points though the volume of shares traded
on the day declined over that of the previous day.
</P>
<P>
The all share price index stood at 2,300.14 points at the end
of Monday's trading while the index once leaped to over 3,600 in
the middle part of last month.

readymade garments, jute and fish products, worth about 420
million dollars to the U.K. against the imports such as machinery
and chemicals worth 110 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh, the largest recipient of overseas development
assistance of Britain, receives 50 million dollars annually for
its development sectors.
</P>
<P>
John Major will fly in here on the last leg of his three South
Asian nation tour. Two others are India and Pakistan.
</P>

searching fresh markets for his country's products in the former
British colonies and rejuvenating relations with them.

CHANGCHUN, December 31 (Xinhua) -- A sophisticated
telecommunications transmission network has gone into operation in
northeast China's Jilin Province, greatly easing Jilin's
overloaded long-distance telecom system.
</P>
<P>
The network, which adopts the SDH (synchronous digital
hierarchy) technology, one of the most advanced optical transport
mode in the world, was built at a total cost of 250 million yuan
and will double Jilin's long-distance transmission capacity.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the high-quality phone service, the network can
provide such telecom services as visual telephone for
conference use, digital and date exchange and mobile phone.
</P>
<P>
Before this, all the long-distance telephone webs of the
province were based on copper cables featuring a smaller transport
capacity and low availability.
</P>
<P>
Jilin currently has a total of 4,500 km of optical cable
lines. Optical telecom service is available in every township.
</P>
<P>
To meet people's growing need for high-quality telecom

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Bangladesh's Political Stability Seen As </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Calm finally prevails in Dhaka,
Bangladesh's once agitated capital, as 1996 is drawing to an end,
but observers said the stability may be fragile as long-standing
conflicts persist between the government and the opposition.
</P>
<P>
After its seventh general elections on June 12 this year, the
country ventured onto a course toward political stability,
leaving behind it more than two years of unrest and strife for
power.
</P>
<P>
Tension began to run high in March 1994 when the Awami League
(AL) boycotted the parliament for alleged poll rigging by the then
ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) in a by-election in
Magura District.
</P>
<P>
Since then, nationwide strikes, blockades, bloody clashes,
rallies and demonstrations had been the common scene on the
streets of cities and towns across Bangladesh, with hundreds of
people killed and economic and social life severely affected in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The growing tension forced the then BNP government led by Begum
Khaleda Zia to step down in late March this year and hand over
power to a neutral caretaker government led by former Chief
Justice Habibur Rahman.
</P>
<P>
By winning the June 12 elections successfully administered by
the caretaker government, the AL returned to power on June 23
after 21 years in opposition.
</P>
<P>
Stability and peace are much wanted by the AL and its
government led by Sheikh Hasina, which are eager to revive the
national economy and win popularity.
</P>
<P>
The AL has been seeking to alleviate the long-standing grudges
of the BNP against it by urging the opposition to join a
"government of consensus." It has taken measures to restore law
and order and put special emphasis on economic diplomacy, inviting
foreign investment to the country.
</P>
<P>
According to Finance Minister Shah A. M. S. Kibria,
Bangladesh's economy is now in a very good shape with a low
inflation rate, an increasing revenue, a strong export and a
significant growth of the gross domestic product expected for the
current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the signing of a 30-year accord with India on
Bangladesh's right share of the common Ganges water during the
150-day dry season has apparently boosted the government's
popularity.
</P>
<P>
However, political controversies remain, centering on the water
agreement and some other major national issues.
</P>
<P>
The BNP, which is now indefinitely boycotting the parliament
for "unfair treatment" by the Treasury Bench in the house, has
announced that it will go for street agitation to protest against
the water treaty, which it described as "uneven, incomplete and
detrimental to national interest."
</P>
<P>
The opposition strongly opposes the trial of killers of "the
Father of the Nation" Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the late father of
Prime Minister Hasina, who was assassinated along with his wife
and sons in a military coup on August 15, 1975.
</P>
<P>
The BNP also criticizes the investigation on BNP chief Khaleda
and her former cabinet ministers for alleged corruption and the
possible release of former military ruler H. M. Ershad.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said they fear that the opposition would carry
out violent street struggles any time the government takes action
against opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
They also said the military is out of favor with the present
government, which is a major factor in potential instability.

<HEADLINE> Ups and Downs in China's Basketball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The year of 1996 saw ups and
downs in China's basketball with the men's team gaining a
best-ever eighth place at the Centennial Olympics last August
while the women's side dropping to a disappointed ninth.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese men's team, continental champion in the last two
decades, surprised basketball field by squeezing into the world's
top eight in Atlanta, outplaying African champion Angola and South
American second finisher Argentina in the 16-team event.
</P>
<P>
With the success, the Chinese men wrote a history in the
continental basketball by becoming the first Asian squad to gain
such a glory at major international competitions.
</P>
<P>
However, the women's side, runners-up at the Barcelona Games
and the world championships, declined to the bottom and will face
a serious situation in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
For a long time the team had relied mainly on tall center Zheng
Haixia, who stands 2.05 meters, and when Zheng was heavily guarded
it could hardly produce a new tactic. Many people had expected
that it was only a matter of time for the team to meet its
Waterloo.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that it is the lack of younger talents and
injuries of the veterans that handed the team the worst result and
an urgent reshuffle is needed if the team really hopes to regain
its previous fame.
</P>
<P>
Head coach Chen Daohong was also criticized for his tactics and
substitutions in the two key group matches against Italy and
Japan. After four years of coaching, Chen left the team at the
end of November.
</P>
<P>
Also in 1996, Chinese basketball officials quickened their
steps towards market-oriented reforms, especially among the male
teams. Following the success of the 12-team Chinese Basketball
Association first division league (CBA) last season, a new league
was created to parallel with the CBA.
</P>
<P>
The eight-team professional league, called the Chinese New
Basketball Alliance, was inaugurated last November with four
American players and one American coach in each team.
</P>
<P>
The new league adopted a double home-and-away playing system
and their game features four 12-minute quarters, an alternative
match form adopted by the International Basketball Federation
(FIBA) in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The new league, converted from China's second division and two
college teams, has posed a challenge to the existing CBA, which
plays according to FIBA's amateur rules with two halves of 20
minutes.
</P>
<P>
With the two league matches, Chinese basketball officials
believed it would help China find "the best way to develop real
professional basketball and boost the sport in the country."
</P>
<P>
"If the new league proves a success, we will introduce the
concepts and system to CBA," said Zhong Tianfa, vice president of
the Chinese Basektball Association. "If not, it wouldn't hurt the
current basketball program."
</P>
<P>
Zhong said that this was just the beginning of China's
basketball reform, which, he hoped, would bring about
revolutionary changes to the sport in China.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese basketball officials, there are about 100
million people playing basketball in China, and the sport has been
rooted deeply among the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Zhong said that with the reforms in full swing in the country,
he was confident that China's basketball would be developing at a
much higher speed.

<P>
PYONGYANG, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Pyongyang and Washington
reaffirmed their commitment to the implementation of the nuclear
framework agreement during the bilateral talks held in New York
from December 9 to 29, reported the Korean Central News Agency on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to further promote bilateral
relations at the talks attended by officials of the Foreign
Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and
the U.S. National Security Council and the State Department.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side promised that it would take additional measures
to ease the trade embargo on the DPRK and provide more food aid to
the country which has been suffering from food shortage after two
consecutive years of serious flooding.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK said that it would resume the storage of spent nuclear
fuels and listen to a "joint briefing" on the proposed "four-way
talks."
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton and South Korean President Kim
Young-sam earlier this year invited the DPRK and China to take
part in talks aimed at securing a lasting peace to replace the
truce that ended the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
The September submarine incident, for which Pyongyang
apologized on Sunday, halted the peace initiative, froze
international food aid and ceased the implementation of the 1994
U.S.-DPRK nuclear framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Pyongyang pledged to freeze its nuclear
weapons program in return for 6 billion dollars worth of new
nuclear power reactors and alternative energy supplies.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denounces Cairo Statement of Damascus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Iran strongly denounced the
Cairo statement issued by foreign ministers of Syria, Egypt and
six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), the official
Iranian news agency IRNA reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a strong-worded statement issued Sunday at the conclusion of
their routine two-day meetings, the eight countries, members of
the Damascus Declaration, denounced Iran for occupying three Gulf
islands claimed by the United Arab Emirates (UAE). They said Iran
had deployed missiles on the disputed Gulf islands of Abu Musa,
Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb in "a direct threat to the Gulf Arab
countries."
</P>
<P>
The IRNA quoted Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud
Mohammadi as saying that he strongly denounced the adoption of
such a stand against Iran and considered the move contrary to
good relations, breach of collective security in the Persian Gulf
and weakening of common interest of the region.
</P>
<P>
He argued that Iran has the longest coastline in the Persian
Gulf, it deems it necessary to take measures in the area of
defense.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said Iran would take any measure deemed necessary to
reinforce its defense system against any possible danger which
threatens the territorial integrity of Iran, adding that such a
security measure cannot be interpreted as a threat to the
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman called on the Arab countries to exercise
far-sighted attitude consistent with the sensitive issue and
vital situation of the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
In their statement, foreign ministers of the eight countries
called on Iran to restrain itself from any move that might
jeopardize the security in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi noted that "such statements concerning the Islamic
Republic of Iran fall short of wisdom and logic." he said that the
statement which asks Iran not to set up installations at the
three Gulf islands "is a blatant interference in the internal
affairs of the sovereignty of Iran."
</P>
<P>
He cautioned the signatories to the statement to exercise
restraint against such a persisting stance.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Abu Musa, Greater and Lesser Tunbs as
integral, indivisible and inseparable part of Iran, the spokesman
reiterated that "repetition of baseless claim on Iranian
territory and illogical support of the GCC will not help the
United Arab Emirates resolve its problems in clearing off
its misunderstanding."
</P>
<P>
However, he said that Iran is ready to hold bilateral
talks with the UAE with no prior conditions in order to foil
the attempts being made to divert the Moslem attention from
the threat of the Israeli regime.
</P>
<P>
A dispute has existed since early 1970s between Iran and the
UAE over the three Gulf islands which are strategically situated
at the entrance to the Gulf, opposite the Strait of Hormuz.
</P>
<P>
On November 30, 1971, one day before the British troops'
withdrawal and two days before the proclamation of the UAE, Iranian
troops occupied the three islands.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said Iran expects the friendly Moslem states in
the region to exercise far-sightedness of the looming threats
which are endangering the common regional interests and collective
security of the Persian Gulf.

<HEADLINE> Australian Shares Predicted to Climb Higher in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Australia's All Ordinaries
Index is predicted to climb to 2,500 points in 1997 after the
share market experienced a political change, several interest rate
cuts and a galloping Wall Street in the outgoing year.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters here today, analysts said the market's
leading indicator, the All Ordinaries Index, broke through the
2,400-point barrier today to end 1996 at an all-time high of
2,424.6 points and posted a new intra-day high of 2,426.5.
</P>
<P>
The previous record was set on November 25 when the All
Ordinaries Index reached 2,394.7 points.
</P>
<P>
During 1996, the market grew by 10 percent or 221.6 points with
the total capitalization of the Australian share market rising by
18 percent to 391 billion Australian dollars (312.8 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The year's low of 2,096.1 was recorded on July 17 after a
3-percent fall on Wall Street that week, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the optimistic view of many analysts, some people are
cautious about taking an overly bullish tone into the new year as
the strength of the pickup in the local economy and the global
economic growth still remain uncertain for 1997.

<HEADLINE> Cross-Straits Cultural Exchanges Going Deeper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Cultural exchanges between the
two sides of the Taiwan Straits have progressed smoothly this
year, and were notably more rational and in-depth than in the past.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua News Agency, Yin Zhiliang, director
of the Bureau of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan Cultural Affairs of
the Ministry of Culture, said it is currently the common
understanding of compatriots on both sides of the straits to
further promote cultural exchanges, guided by the "peaceful
reunification, and one country, two systems" principle as well as
President Jiang Zemin's eight-point proposition on the Taiwan
issue.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, some 2,171 trips were made between the two sides of
the straits, involving a total of 268 cultural exchange programs.
</P>
<P>
Although the number is decreasing compared to the previous
years due to the Taiwan authorities' divisive activities, the
exchanges are operating at a deeper and more extensive level, Yin
said.
</P>
<P>
Promoting the Chinese national culture has become the mainstay
of the cross-straits cultural exchanges, and performances given by
artistic groups with distinctive ethnic features were
well-received by Taiwan audiences.
</P>
<P>
Cross-straits cultural exchanges are also expanding to include
music, fine arts, dance, opera, film, handicrafts and
archaeology. People traveling to Taiwan included not only
personnel in art groups, but also experts, scholars, students,
teachers, workers, and farmers.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there were more cross-straits academic exchanges this
year. More people went to the island for academic purposes, while
some seminars were held to discuss Chinese arts and culture by
artists from both sides of the straits.

<HEADLINE> Israel, India Negotiate Arms Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Israel and India are
negotiating at an advanced stage on arms deal, today's Jerusalem
Post quoted an Israeli official source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed source, who is accompanying Israeli President Ezer
Weizman on visit to India, noted India is a relatively untapped
market for Israel's defense industry.
</P>
<P>
As defense ties between the two countries grow closer, Israel
is reportedly looking into the upgrading of India's MiG-21
fighters.
</P>
<P>
Israel Aircraft Industries head Moshe Keret is due to fly to
India today to hold discussions on the deal, together with other
Israeli defense representatives already there, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports from India said that the Indian navy is
considering buying advanced multi-mode maritime surveillance radar
from Israel, following the reported acquisition by Pakistan of
three P-3C Orion Maritime surveillance aircrafts from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The radar can be fitted onto patrol helicopters and can
track up to 100 targets at a time, said the report, adding
the proposal will be discussed during Weizman's visit.
</P>
<P>
The radar proposal comes close on the heels of a
10-million-dollar deal to facilitate India's purchase of two Super
Dvora MKII patrol boats.
</P>
<P>
Further sales of patrol boats will also be discussed during
the week-long presidential visit, the first official visit by
an Israeli head of state to India, the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Jordan is now busy with
strengthening trade ties with Iraq after the implementation of
the oil-for-food deal which Baghdad has signed with the United
Nations, Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Information Minister Marwan Muasher as saying
that Jordanian Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Hashem Dabbas
and Finance Minister Marwan Awad are in Iraq now to hold talks
with Iraqi officials on renewing the oil agreement between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Jordan was seeking to buy 4.5 million tons of crude oil
from Iraq in 1997, an increase of 7 per cent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
Muasher noted that it was unlikely that the trade protocol,
under which Jordan supplied goods and services worth 220 million
U.S. dollars to Iraq in return for the oil supplies in 1996,
would undergo any major change for the year 1997.
</P>
<P>
"We do not expect any major changes to the trade accord," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Muasher said Industry and Trade Minister Ali Abul Ragheb
and Transport Minister Nasser Lawzi were scheduled to visit
Iraq soon for finalizing the 1997 trade protocol and discussing
transport-related issues.
</P>
<P>
In Baghdad, the two ministers are also expected to discuss
issues related to Iraqi outstanding debts to Jordan, which,
Muasher said, amounts to 1.3 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cement Firms Reject Japanese Producers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Israeli cement firms have
expressed their strong rejection to Japanese cement producers'
intention to enter the Israeli cement market, today's Jerusalem
Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The local market "has no room" for another major producer,
sources in the cement industry said in response to reports that
a large Japanese conglomerate wants to build a cement plant here
at an investment of some 250-300 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The plant would potentially bite deep into the market share
of Nesher Cement, Israel's sole producer which has three
facilities that compete with various importers.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the company expressed doubt that a foreign
company intends to make such a large investment at a time when
there is an oversupply of cement in the local market.
</P>
<P>
In April, Nesher was forced to temporarily shut down three
mills because it had accumulated a large quantity of cement.
</P>
<P>
During the past few years, several foreign companies
expressed interest in entering the local cement market, but all
backed out mainly because the market is very capital-intensive.

<HEADLINE> Arafat-Netanyahu Summit Likely Today to Close Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 31 (Xinhua) -- As the year 1996 nears
its end, a summit between Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is likely to be
held today to seal the Hebron deal.
</P>
<P>
Amid the intensive last-ditch diplomatic activities to meet
the new year deadline for clinching the deal, U.S. peace envoy
Dennis Ross, who returned to the region Monday, held separate
meetings with Netanyahu and Arafat last night to bridge the
remaining gap between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting with Ross in Gaza,
Arafat said that he hoped to hold a meeting with Netanyahu
late today to wrap up the long-delayed deal on Israeli troop
redeployment in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Taking a cautious stance, Ross on his part only said that
both sides were working very hard to resolve the last
differences blocking the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said the remaining obstacles were the issues
of conducting joint police patrols in part of Hebron and the
timetable for Israeli troop's further redeployment in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side is insisting on joint patrols near the
Tomb of Patriarches, the religious shrine holy to both Jews and
Muslims. But Netanyahu rejected such demand, claiming Israel's
sole right of security control in the area and the safety of 450
settlers living among 120,000 Palestinians in the city.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Netanyahu last night, Ross acknowledged
that while the gap between the two sides was narrowing, more work
needed to be done to close the deal.
</P>
<P>
Dore Gold, Netanyahu's diplomatic adviser, told reporters after
 the Ross-Netanyahu meeting that now there were no work left for
the negotiating teams from the two sides to do, and it was the
time for a Arafat-Netanyahu meeting to finalize the Hebron
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted Netanyahu as saying that he would not sign
the Hebron deal before he was convinced that the security of the
Hebron Jews would be ensured and that Israel would control the
holy site.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu reportedly told Ross that Israel's "red line" for
signing a deal was that it refused the demand for joint
patrols. One alternative being considered is that the Muslim Wakf
at the Tomb of Patriarchs will begin a liaison relationship with
the local Israeli-Palestinian coordinating office.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu denied that the U.S. was exerting pressure on him,
adding that "the opposite is true." He described Ross' mediation
as "responsible and friendly."
</P>
<P>
As Israeli and Palestinian negotiators today continued the
talks on clearing the remaining obstacles, Ross is to meeting
with Netanyahu again today to follow up his meeting with
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The results of the meetings will determine whether there
is an possibility for a Arafat-Netanyahu summit to initial the
deal, observers said.

JAKARTA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake measuring 6.0 on

a.m. local time today (1941 Monday GMT), said reports reaching
here.

<P>
HARARE, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The Export Processing Zones
(EPZ) Authority of Zimbabwe has so far approved a total
investment of 200 million US Dollars in seven locations
countrywide since its inception last March.
</P>
<P>
EPZ Board Chairman Elias Ngugama said yesterday unlike many
EPZ programs where textiles, footwear and garment manufacturing
had dominated activities, Zimbabwe's EPZ companies had
concentrated mainly on agro-related activities.
</P>
<P>
Ngugama said, ''since the first board meeting in March 1996,
the authority has approved 16 industrial and three zone
development projects with the industrial being mostly in the
areas of processing and manufacturing.''
</P>
<P>
Six projects involved the processing of basic agricultural
commodities such as vegetables, fish and paprika.
</P>
<P>
''With the implementation of these projects, 1997 will see the
creation of a total of 2,684 additional direct jobs. Further
indirect job opportunities will be created in downstream
activities linked with EPZ,'' said Ngugama.
</P>
<P>
The EPZ program was designed to promote exports, and for a
project to qualify for the EPZ status it should be in a position
to export at least 80 percent of its production. enditem

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Woman's Eleven Embryos Brought Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- A Cypriot woman, who became
pregnant with 11 embryos, now has only two of them in her after
two successful operations, Cyprus Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
The selective abortion operation, the second of the type in
a fortnight and undertaken under the family's request, was done at
Makarios Hospital here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Andreas Patsalides said that his patient, Zoe Efstathiou,
23, who conceived the astonishing number of embryos after a
course of fertility drugs, had three more embryos terminated
Monday. It was planned to terminate four but one had already died.
</P>
<P>
Zoe and her husband have wanted to leave as many babies
as possible to live, and it was originally planned that three
or four would be allowed to grow.
</P>
<P>
But on the advice of doctors, the couple had agreed to
leave two to give them a better chance of survival.
</P>
<P>
Patsalides said the two remaining fetuses and the mother were
in good health.
</P>
<P>
If the termination had not taken place, all 11 embryos
would abort spontaneously at around 13-15 weeks. Zoe is already
eleven weeks into her pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
Zoe's 11 embryos were discovered after nine-week pregnancy
during an ultrasound scan at the hospital.

<HEADLINE> Syria Refuses to Resume Talks Without Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Syria will not agree to
resume peace talks with Israel without an Israeli commitment to
withdraw from the Golan Heights the Jewish state occupied in July
1967, Syrian Vice-President Abdul-Halim Khaddam has said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Beirut's As-Safir daily which was
published today, Khaddam said that the United States had
"orally" conveyed to Damascus a commitment on the Israeli
withdrawal to the border of July 4, 1967.
</P>
<P>
"We do not accept any negotiations not based on this point,"
the Syrian vice-president noted.
</P>
<P>
"The peace talks should be resumed from where they stopped
and should not go backward," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Since the beginning, we have said that any peace not based
on retrieving the Arab rights is unacceptable, and the contacts
held in Washington in the past four years were revolved around
this point," he said.
</P>
<P>
Peace negotiations between Syria and Israel were suspended in
February, 1996, amid a series of suicide bombings in the Jewish
state.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam complained that Arab countries failed to map out a
united security plan as an equivalent to those of the Israeli
government of Prime Minister Binjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"The new Israeli government has plans pertaining to the
regional security, Arab security and international security, but
the Arabs have not any equivalent plan." Khaddam said.
</P>
<P>
Israel recently carried out military manoeuvres in the Golan
Heights and has increased budget of the Israeli army, he noted,
"the Americans said that Israel does not want to launch a war,
and the manoeuvres were defensive measures."
</P>
<P>
"We said that although we have the aspiration and decision on
peace, we will not be careless in the possibility of an Israeli
aggression," he added.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question about when the peace talks will be
resumed, the Syrian leader said, "the problem is not with us,
nor with the Americans."
</P>
<P>
"When Israel decides to change its policy and realizes that
the peace is in the interests of all sides and the bases of
the peace process are acceptable, I believe that then the
negotiations will be resumed," Khaddam said.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian vice-president described his country's relations
with Iran as "strategic," saying that both countries want to
enhance the relations in order to consolidate the security in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"Iran is an allied country and our relations with it are
good," he said, adding that the two countries "are making efforts
in order to enhance these relations, and by doing so the regional
security is consolidated."

<HEADLINE> Kenya Reduces Charges on International Phone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is to cut its
international telephone and facsimile charges by 0.5-33.3 percent
from January 1, leaving the tariff the lowest in the eastern
African region, the Kenya Times newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
Jan Mutai, the managing director of the Kenya Posts and
Telecommunications Corporation, was quoted as saying on Monday
that the new package is a three-tier tariff structure divided
into standard, economy and discount rates.
</P>
<P>
The current standard rate in the COMESA region of Africa is at
2.1 U.S. dollars and collected from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. during
week days. Now it will be down to two dollars while the economy
rate (9:00 p.m. -2:00 a.m.) reduced to 1.7 dollars and the
discount rate (2:00 a.m.- 7:00 a.m.) to 1.5 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The rates are slightly higher in the non-COMESA regions of
Africa, Europe, the United States and Australia, but they are
also falling from three dollars to 2.5 (standard), from 2.55
dollars to two (economy) and from 2.55 to 1.7 dollars (discount).
</P>
<P>
In the rest of the world, the rates will fall from standard
3.98 dollars to 3.30, economy 3.38 dollars to 2.70 and discount
3.38 dollars to 2.30.
</P>
<P>
The reduction will enhance Kenya's available exchange capacity
and help attract more foreign investors into the country, said
Mutai.

PHNOM PENH, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia will demobilize
some 43,000 soldiers in 1997, Defense Ministry spokesman Chum
Sambath said today.
</P>
<P>
Chum Sambath said only about 11,500 soldiers will be
demobilized in the first half of next year due to the lack of
resettling funds.
</P>

The process of demobilization will be arranged in accordance
with the military budget approved by the National Assembly, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The daily "Light of Cambodia" today quoted Chairman of the
Demobilization Committee Dam Vuth as saying that until December 26
the committee had received equipment worth 330,000 U.S. dollars
from the World Bank and the Australian government for the purpose
of demobilization.
</P>
<P>
Dam Vuth confirmed that officers from various military regions,
who are to be in charge of the demobilization, have been trained
on how to conduct the work and how to use the equipment.
</P>
<P>
Dam Vuth said, "We have made preparations for the first step to
demobilize the old and disabled soldiers, including the old and
handicapped ones who broke away from the Khmer Rouge and joined
the RCAF (Royal Cambodian Armed Forces) recently."

BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- In a New Year message
broadcast worldwide, Chinese President Jiang Zemin today called on
statesmen of all countries to cooperate and work toward the goal of
eliminating wars and poverty, safeguarding world peace and
promoting a common development of the global community.
</P>
<P>
In his message to the overseas audience of China Radio
International and China Central Television, delivered here on the
eve of 1997, Jiang expressed confidence in the future of China and
the world, and stated, "we are prepared to work with the people of
other countries in creating a new world which is peaceful, stable and
prosperous, and which is filled with the promises of progress."
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China maintained its rapid economic growth
while deepening its reform and opening-up process in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"Inflation has been slowed, and the overall environment for
macro-control has improved," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Political stability and national unity prevail over the whole
country, and the people live and work in peace and contentment,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The 15th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party will
be held in 1997, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"It will be an historic event contributing to the advancement
of the building of socialism with Chinese characteristics," he

The Chinese president extended a welcome to more friends of

</P>
<P>
Jiang said that 1996 also witnessed the continuous easing of
tensions in international relations.
</P>
<P>
"As the world moves toward multipolarization," he commented,
"power politics has been rebuffed everywhere. Developing countries
are becoming stronger, and the pursuit of peace, stability,
equality and development has become the common desire of all
people throughout the world."
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, world peace and development are still
threatened by power politics and hegemonism, and wars and poverty
still plague people in some parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
"This is not yet a peaceful world," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President appealed to the statesmen worldwide to
shoulder the historical responsibility together, and work
hand-in-hand toward the goal of wiping out wars and poverty,
safeguarding world peace, and promoting a common development of

"The return of Hong Kong to the motherland will wash away a
century's old national disgrace and signal a significant victory
in the Chinese people's struggle toward national reunification,"
he said. "We are fully confident about Hong Kong's future, and

He stressed that the status of Hong Kong as the world's center

<P>
"We will continue efforts to promote direct contacts and
exchanges between the mainland and Taiwan," the Chinese President
said. "We welcome comments and suggestions from people
representing various circles in Taiwan on the peaceful
reunification. In the meantime, the Taiwan authorities are well
advised to respect the national interests, to cease all activities
designed to split the motherland, and to make practical moves
toward the improvement of cross-straits relations."
</P>
<P>
"China treasures its hard-won independence and peace," Jiang
said. "We are firmly opposed to hegemonism and all activities in
international relations that are unjust."

"China will never seek hegemony. It will always stand on the
side of the cause for international justice. The Chinese
government and people will, as always, adhere to an independent
foreign policy for peace, and they hope to live in harmony with
people around the world," he said.

Dhlakama, the chairman of the Mozambican National Resistance

These county leaders, originally from the RENAMO, told

Dhlakama warned that "national reconciliation is being under
threat" and he called for the removal of these leaders who had
defected from RENAMO to the FRELIMO.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Law on Stationing Troops in HKSAR Hailed in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 31 (Xinhua) -- China's Law on Stationing
Troops in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has
won positive response from among the people of various sectors
here today.
</P>
<P>
Many of the dignitaries noted that the law, passed at the 23rd
session of the Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's
Congress (NPC) in Beijing Monday, fully embodies the principle of
"one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
Paggy Lam Pei, member of the Provisional Legislative Council
(PLC), said Hong Kong people agree with and support the Law on
Stationing Troops in the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
She said the promulgation of the law was based on the opinions
of the Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
Wang Siu Yee, also a PLC member, noted that while approving the
law, the NPC Standing Committee took Hong Kong people's views into
account and it had also held serious discussions on the draft of
the law before the approval.
</P>
<P>
Chang Ka-mum, member of the Association for Democracy and
People's Livelihood and member of the Preparatory Committee for
the HKSAR, said that the amendments made to the draft law at the
NPC's Monday session conform to the actual conditions in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that most Hong Kong people welcome the
law.
</P>
<P>
Lo Suk-ching, member of the Hong Kong Legislative Council as
well as of the PLC, said the law embodies Chinese sovereignty over
Hong Kong and it will benefit the security and stability of the
HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Lau Kong Wah, member of the PLC and Hong Kong affairs advisor,
said the law is the embodiment of Hong Kong people's will and it
will contribute to Hong Kong's long-term stability and prosperity
after 1997.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Business Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The following are business
briefs from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt is preparing a program to increase exports by
10 percent annually during the next five years, Minister of Trade
and Supply Ahmed Goweili has said, the English-language newspaper
The Egyptian Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
Goweili made the remarks Monday at the conference on promoting
Egyptian exports during the fiscal year of 1996-1997.
</P>
<P>
He said that the program was an ambitious one as the volume of
exports remained at the same level during the last five years.
</P>
<P>
The minister told the conference organized by the Exports
Promotion Center that the Ministry would focus on providing
required infrastructure and financing for exports in cooperation
with Egyptian banks and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's economic growth slowed down to 4.4
percent in 1996 from 7.1 and 6.4 percent in 1995 and 1994,
according to official preliminary figures released today.
</P>
<P>
The figures of the Central Bureau of Statistics indicated the
economy has been slowing down over the past two quarters, after
half a decade of robust growth,
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate declined to 6.5 percent from 7 percent
in 1995, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Business-sector growth stood at 5.2 percent, while industrial
growth reached 5.6 percent, and construction activity expanded by
4.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Gross per capita product rose 2 percent and reached 16,900
U.S. dollars, after growing by 4 percent during each of the two
preceding years.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit hit a record 10.7 billion dollars, according
to preliminary data, after reaching 9.8 billion dollars in 1995
and 7.9 billion dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israeli cement firms have expressed their
strong rejection to Japanese cement producers' intention to enter
the Israeli cement market, today's Jerusalem Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The local market "has no room" for another major producer,
sources in the cement industry said in response to reports that a
large Japanese conglomerate wants to build a cement plant here at
an investment of some 250-300 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The plant would potentially bite deep into the market share
of Nesher Cement, Israel's sole producer which has three
facilities that compete with various importers.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the company expressed doubt that a foreign
company intends to make such a large investment at a time when
there is an oversupply of cement in the local market.
</P>
<P>
During the past few years, several foreign companies
expressed interest in entering the local cement market, but all
backed out mainly because the market is very
capital-intensive.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan is now busy with enhancing trade ties with
Iraq after the implementation of the oil-for-food deal which
Baghdad has signed with the United Nations, Jordan Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Information Minister Marwan Muasher as saying
that Jordanian Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Hashem
Dabbas and Finance Minister Marwan Awad are in Iraq now to hold
talks with Iraqi officials on renewing the oil agreement between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Jordan was seeking to buy 4.5 million tons of crude oil from
Iraq in 1997, an increase of 7 per cent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
Muasher noted that it was unlikely that the trade protocol,
under which Jordan supplied goods and services worth 220 million
U.S. dollars to Iraq in return for the oil supplies in 1996,
would undergo any major change for the year 1997.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Govt Cuts Rice Quota to Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The Sierra Leonean
government has reduced rice quotas given at subsidised prices to
the security services including the military, police and prisons,
a source from the Ministry of Finance said in an interview today.
</P>
<P>
He did not disclosed the number of bags curtailed but he said
that about 50,000 bags are supplied monthly to the army, the
police and the prisons.
</P>
<P>
"We are experiencing a lot of difficulties in honoring the
colossal sum in rice checks issued to contractors which is
running into several billions of Leones (S. Leone's local
currency)," said the source.
</P>
<P>
The source said that prisoners' diet will not be affected by
the reduction but "only those supplies given to officers are
being reduced."
</P>
<P>
In his recent speech to parliament, Finance Minister Thaimu
Bangura said "the government is spending a colossal sum on rice
importation and supplies to the security services."
</P>
<P>
He said the importation of rice "will be reduced by at least
50 percent in five years."
</P>
<P>
Rice, the country's major staple food, has over the years
become a political issue.
</P>
<P>
Supplying rice at a generally reduced rate of about one U.S.
Dollar to the security services while civilians buy it at over 20
U.S. Dollars, was started in 1991 by the civilian government of
the late President Siaka Stevens.
</P>
<P>
This was aimed at augmenting the low salary structure of the
armed forces. Each private was entitled to two bags while a
senior officer got up to 10 or more bags. The method was carried
on by successive governments. In 1996, the government spent
30,000 U.S. Dollars for the importation of rice from Pakistan,
Burma, the Philippines and China.

<HEADLINE> First Chinese Agricultural Survey Starts Tomorrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- China is to formally launch
its first agricultural survey tomorrow, a huge-scale undertaking
that will involve more than six million interviewers visiting 230
million rural households in approximately 800,000 villages and
some 20 million rural enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He Huanyan, an official with the National Agricultural Survey
Office, said that the organization has allowed some places in the
outlying provinces of Yunnan, Xinjiang and Qinghai, and the
autonomous regions of Ningxia and Inner Mongolia to start their
survey as early as October, as heavy winter snow was anticipated
in these remote areas during the winter period.
</P>
<P>
The survey, he said, is expected to enable China, for the first
time, to obtain an accurate account of the total area of its
farmland.
</P>
<P>
"The survey will retrieve information on the number and
educational levels of rural residents as well as what trades they
are engaged in," he said.
</P>
<P>
The survey also will show how many farmers left their homes in
1996 to look for jobs in cities.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "China also hopes to know the sizes of rural
households, numbers of pigs, cows and chickens they raise, and the
condition of their farm tools, implements and equipment in
farming."
</P>
<P>
The survey, which required a three-year preparation period,
will also clarify the actual number of foreign-funded agricultural
firms that have been established and whether they are profitable.
</P>
<P>
The interviewing and double-checking of survey statistics will
last about a month, but it will take two years to establish a
national databank on the country's agricultural resources, he said.
</P>
<P>
China plans to conduct an agricultural survey once every
decade, beginning in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong People Confident of Post-'97 Sports (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 31 (Xinhua) -- "I'm confident of Hong
Kong's sports after 1997 and I expect more exchanges and contacts
in the future between Hong Kong and China's mainland," said a
senior official of the Hong Kong Amateur Sports Federation and
Olympic Committee (HKASFOC).
</P>
<P>
The comments, made by A. de O. Sales, president of the HKASFOC,
 to Xinhua Monday, represent a consensus of local sports officials
 and athletes when they look forward to the year of 1997, a year
in which the historic handover of Hong Kong will take place at
the midnight of June 30.
</P>
<P>
Sales, who has long been the chief of the local sports
governing body with some 70 affiliated organizations, said he has
been in good cooperation with Chinese sports organizations since
the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that such exchanges and contacts will
continue after the handover.
</P>
<P>
"We have been enjoying a very cooperative relationship with
China's mainland in the field of sports and I hope such
relationship could be further increased after the handover," said
Andrew Ma, chief executive of the Hong Kong Sports Development
Board.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very confident of Hong Kong after 1997 and I hope to
develop our relations with sports organizations in China's
mainland," he added. "We have a lot of things to do in this
field."
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident that Hong Kong will keep its independent status
in international sports after 1997, when Hong Kong will compete
under the name of 'Hong Kong, China'," he continued.
</P>
<P>
As it will be a new age featuring sports information and sports
information technologies, Hong Kong should be an international
sports information center and provide services to China's mainland
and other countries and regions, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
And broad prospects exist for even closer cooperation between
Hong Kong and other Chinese provinces and autonomous regions in
such fields as coaching, personnel exchange, scientific research
and sports sponsorship.

Hong Kong has been enjoying close and frequent contacts with
China's mainland in football and such exchanges are expected to be
extended to an even broader area, said Hui Chun Fui, chairman of
the Hong Kong Football Association.
</P>
<P>
"Such exchanges would be more convenient in the future and will
take place in an even broader range," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that China's mainland will further relax
its regulations governing the exchange of players, which he thinks
will help Hong Kong raise the standard of play.
</P>
<P>
"I'm definitely optimistic and confident of post-1997 Hong Kong
and its sports," said woman wind surfer Lee Lai Shan, who won Hong
Kong's first-ever Olympic gold medal at the Atlanta Games in the
past summer.
</P>
<P>
She expected more and convenient contacts and exchanges between
athletes from Hong Kong and China's mainland in the future.
</P>
<P>
They will both benefit from such cooperation and get themselves
ready for the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok and the Olympic Games in
2000 in Sydney, she said.
</P>
<P>
Ronnie Wong, secretary of the Hong Kong Amateur Swimming
Association, said the handover of Hong Kong next year is expected
to help establish closer ties between sports in Hong Kong and
China's mainland.
</P>
<P>
"We have many things to do in future exchanges, especially in
the sport of diving," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that China's mainland will continue to
help Hong Kong in this sport.
</P>
<P>
Both Yue Kwok Leung, chairman of the Hong Kong Table Tennis
Association, and Norman Chan, chairman of the Hong Kong Basketball
Association, expressed the hope that Hong Kong and China's
mainland will increase exchanges between their professional
leagues.
</P>
<P>
"I'll encourage our subordinate associations and clubs to
further their contacts with their counterparts in the mainland,"
said Yue.

<HEADLINE> Operations Stop at Southern Somali Port of Merca </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 31 (Xinhua) --operations at the southern
port town of Merca have stopped early this morning following a
serious misunderstanding between the regional officials of
Hussein Mohamed Aidid and the business community committee in the
town.
</P>
<P>
The misunderstanding is reported to arise from an extortion
demand made by the man in charge of Merca appointed by Hussein
Aidid.
</P>
<P>
The business community used to pay somali Shilings 7000 per
sack of rice and sugar (equivalent to 0.9 U.S.Dollar ) of tax to
the government of Hussein Aidid. According to the report, Mahdi
Mohamed Jumale, the representative of Hussein Aidid in Merca, 100
km south of the capital, has imposed the payment of extra 1000
Shillings on each sack or carton of soap, spaghetini or cooking
oil.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Committee for the Businessmen supporting Hussein
Aidid in south Mogadishu have angrily rejected the extra payment.
The committee has characterized the new demand by Jumale as an "
unaceptable extortion and not in touch with the reality thus
exising in the port operations".
</P>
<P>
The business committee has threatened they will suspend using
the natural port of Merca and turn all their importing vessels to
the other port of El-Ma'an, 30 km north of Mogadishu, controlled
by Ali Mahdi Mohamed if the extra money demand is not renounced.
</P>
<P>
Offloading of three commercial vessels docked at the port was
suddenly stopped this morning, and serious negotiations are being
conducted today over the port situation between the business
committee and the regional administrators established by Hussein
Mohamed Aidid.
</P>
<P>
The closure of Merca Port will have a serious impact on the
food prices in Mogadishu's markets and elsewhere in the southern
regions of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government of Hussein Mohamed Aidid has
released 30 prisoners from Baidoa's main jail today.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners mainly belong to the Lisan and Hadamo subclans
of Rahanwein and their release was mediated by Lawyer Hassan
Sheikh Ibrahim, the former Chairman of the Rahanwein Autonomous
Authority, who is a new ally of Hussein Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Hadamo and Lisan subclans mainly fought against Aidid in the
region in their Rahanwein Resistance Army guerrilla fighting.

<HEADLINE> China's New Payment Declaration System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- China will begin using the
international payment declaration system full time starting
tomorrow, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange said in
Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The system covers five areas: indirect declaration through
financial institutions; declaration by financial institutions;
declaration by stock exchanges, brokerages, and listed companies;
declaration by enterprises with foreign direct investment; and
declaration for cash transactions.
</P>
<P>
The administration says that the first part actually started at
the beginning of this year, though the other four will operate
full scale as of tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
After the declaration system is implemented fully, China can
offer more and better balance sheets for different purposes, such
as the balance sheet for international payments and the balance
sheet for international investment, the administration said.
</P>
<P>
"The sheets will provide more high-quality data for macro
policy makers and market participants," it said.

<HEADLINE> Four Coal Miners Rescued 16 Days After Being Trapped Underground </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Four Chinese coal miners who
had been trapped for 16 days in 107-meter-deep mine shaft in
Yixian County, northeast China's Liaoning Province, were rescued
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the miners survived thanks to a hole drilled
into the shaft through which the men were given food, water and
fresh air.
</P>
<P>
On December 15, miners Fan Yongping, Zhang Qingyu, Wang Qinglin
and Wang Qingxiang were checking electric circuits inside the mine
when the pillars that supported the roof of the pit suddenly
collapsed, blocking the exit with rocks.
</P>
<P>
A relief team organized by the mine authorities and the local
government decided that drilling a hole into the shaft would have
the greatest short-term effect.
</P>
<P>
The nearby Liaohe Oil Field sent a group of 50 workers to carry
out the drilling, which continued for 50 hours before the miners
were found. At the time they were found, the miners had existed in
total darkness for six days, and ate bark from the wooden shaft
supports.

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Causes Great Damage in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The Tropical storm that
devastated the west coast of Sabah, East Malaysia, early Thursday
caused about 130 million ringgit (about 52 million US dollars)
damage to government property and infrastructure, Sabah Chief
Minister Yong Teck Lee said today.
</P>
<P>
This estimate was based on reports received from the districts
hit by the rainstorm and floods, he told a press conference in
Sabah's capital Kota Kinabalu, according to the Malaysian national
news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
"The damaged government property belongs to the state and
federal governments, such as buildings, roads, bridges, water
treatment plants, schools and clinics," the state Chief Minister
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the damage caused by the disaster would be many times
more if the losses suffered by individuals and the private sector
as well as economic losses were taken into account.
</P>
<P>
The state government had to use allocations from the
Consolidated Fund and federal allocations to repair the damaged
property, he said, adding the cost of repairs to roads and bridges
in Keningau which was the worst affected district, Kota Kinabalu
and Tenom amounted to 21 million ringgit (about 8.4 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
A total of 11 bridges were either washed away or damaged in
the Keningau district, Yong said.
</P>
<P>
The storm and floods also destroyed agricultural produce and
damaged buildings belonging to the Agriculture Department to the
tune of 22 million ringgit (about 8.8 million US dollars), he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said 993 houses had damaged roofs or walls, 2,869 had their
roofs damaged beyond repair, and 661 houses were swept away.
</P>
<P>
At least 170 people were confirmed killed in the disaster and
many more were reported still missing.

<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The "People's Daily" will
carry a front-page editorial tomorrow to hail the arrival of 1997,
urging the nation to be of one heart and mind as it continues on
its current development course.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says that 1996 is the first year of both China's
ninth Five Year Plan (1996-2000), and also the national social and
economic development program targeted for completion in 2010.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the reform and opening-up process and the socialist
modernization drive have witnessed great successes, the editorial
notes.
</P>
<P>
Industry has grown steadily, and the agricultural sector has
turned out a record output of grain, despite severe natural
disasters in some regions.
</P>
<P>
"The gross domestic product has increased by 10 percent over
the previous year, and the plan for macro-control with the prior
task of curbing inflation has reached its goal," according to the
editorial.
</P>
<P>
It adds that the economy as a whole is on a steady development
track, and is moving at an appropriately high speed.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the efforts of the past three years, it says, not
only has the national economy been developed in a sustained, rapid
and sound way, but sharp fluctuations in it have been prevented.
</P>
<P>
The article cites many other achievements, including further
reform and opening-up, improved living standards, the betterment
of Party construction, and improvements in the legal and
democratic systems.
</P>
<P>
The country has launched various campaigns to promote socialist
culture and ethics, while strengthening the fight against
corruption and the crackdown on crime, it adds.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the diplomatic work has been actively carried
out, and friendly relations with foreign countries have been
further forged, while trade exchanges have been expanded.
</P>
<P>
"Such a beginning is auspicious and encouraging for us as we
work to reach the great goal for the next century, thanks to the
joint efforts by all the ethnic groups under the leadership of the
Party central committee with Jiang Zemin at its core," it
maintains.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: China Moves to Open Up Banking Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The recent approval by China's
central bank to grant four Pudong-based foreign bank branches the
right to handle Renminbi yuan business is a substantial move by
the Chinese government to open up the country's long-ignored
banking sector.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of new China in 1949, the banking industry
has been considered a strategic field that should be forever
monopolized by the State.
</P>
<P>
The four specialized leaders in China's banking industry -- the
Bank of China, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the
China Construction Bank and the Agricultural Bank of China -- had
played a dominant role for decades.
</P>
<P>
However, their long-time control led to the poor management and
performance of China's banking industry, which ultimately hampered
the country's market-oriented economic reform and its efforts to
compete in the world market.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 18 years, the Chinese government has made
strenuous efforts to make local banks more viable, both
domestically and internationally.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, Chinese banks have been asked to become more
competitive by opening similar services. This has resulted in the
mushrooming of business networks of the four state-owned banks and
the evident signs of improvement in their service.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the government has triggered increased
competitions among domestic banks through commercialization of the
four major banks and establishment of a number of public-held
national commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the first national non-government bank, China
Minsheng Banking Corporation, in early 1996 has provided a legal
basis for the country's private banking business.
</P>
<P>
The latest move to allow foreign banks to conduct Renminbi yuan
transactions illustrates the government's sincerity and confidence
to continue its opening-up efforts.
</P>
<P>
And the efforts have paid off.
</P>
<P>
Chinese banks have adopted more and more international
practices and are working hard to increase and improve their
services.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to competitions, local costumers are glad to know they
now have more banking options, and have found dealing with local
banks a much more pleasant experience.
</P>
<P>
China's banking industry has taken a substantial step forward
and is gradually connecting with the international banking
sector.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today called upon his countrymen to be prepared
to adapt their way of life and working to the information
technology era.
</P>
<P>
In his 1997 New Year message which was aired over Malaysian

new technology in this era of information technology will help
boost their incomes and the country's economic growth.
</P>

He said the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC), which includes the
proposed new government administrative center at Putra Jaya and
Cyber city, would be equipped with infrastructural communication
facilities to enable various types of transactions via the
multimedia, that is through audio, imaging, data and all other
information.
</P>
<P>
The MSC covers an area of 15 kilometers by 50 kilometers
extending from the Kuala Lumpur City Center to the new
International Airport in Sepang.
</P>
<P>
"With this, the use of paper correspondence and cash will be
reduced. Instead, all daily matters, government administration and
business transactions will be done through the computer. Similarly
industries will be using computers that can be linked world-wide,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia has succeeded in becoming an industrial nation
and is now entering an era of information technology, an era in
which the workforce consists of knowledgeable workers.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the acquisition of new technology was
important to overcome the shortage of workers and to end the
dependence on foreign workers whose number is now estimated to be
some 2 millions in the country.
</P>
<P>
Dependence on foreign workers was not healthy because it
limited any income increases for the people, Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
The government has set up many universities and new educational
institutions offering courses on information technology and its
application, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said this new knowledge was not difficult to acquire and in
fact many Malaysians of all races had already mastered this
knowledge to the extent of being more advanced than some of those
in the developed countries.
</P>
<P>
While reminding the people of the importance of preserving
unity among the people of various races, Mahathir also hoped that
1997 will be a more successful year for Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Increases Flower Flights to Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's national cargo
airline, Affretair, is flying additional flights to cope with the
increasing pressure of exporting horticultural products destined
for the European market.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the Zimbabwe News Agency today,
Zimbabwe has exported a total of 15,000 tons of flowers this
year, 3,000 tonnes more than in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The flowers will mainly be exported to traditional markets in
Europe, although some producers have indicated that they would
export the flowers to Australia, the Far East, South Africa and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
"There has been increasing pressure on available capacity
during the festive season, forcing Affretair to introduce
a d additional flights to cater for peak season requirements," said
the Commercial Farmers Union (CFU).
</P>
<P>
Affretair operates a DC8-55 and a leased DC10-30 with
capacities of 35 tons and 65 tons respectively.
</P>
<P>
Prices being fetched for the flowers on the European market,
however, remained unimpressive.
</P>
<P>
The CFU report attributed this to the over-supply of the
European market, resulting in increased competition, falling
prices and greater demands for quality of both service and
product.

<HEADLINE> Population Growth Rate Slows in Sweden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The rate of population
growth in Sweden in 1996 was the lowest for 14 years as the number
of births and immigration fell, the Central Statistics Bureau
reported.
</P>
<P>
The population rose just 8,000 in 1996 to 8.845 million, with
1.744 million living in the capital, Stockholm, and its suburbs.
</P>
<P>
Some 95,000 babies were born in 1996, 8,000 fewer than in
1995. The bureau said Swedish women are delaying childbirth until
later in life and are having fewer children than in the past.
</P>
<P>
The average age for mothers giving birth to their first child
is now 27 and the average birthrate for women of childbearing age
has fallen from 2.1 children four years ago to 1.6.
</P>
<P>
Immigration is also falling. Some 40,000 people moved to Sweden
in 1996, down 6,000 on 1995, while emigration rose to 34,000.
</P>
<P>
Swedes are also living longer. The average lifespan for men
rose to 76 and for women to 81, making the country second only to

TEHRAN, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Iran's armed policemen have
captured 126 tons of narcotic drugs from smugglers across the
country for the past nine months, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Reza Seifollahi, commander of the Law Enforcement Forces, said
that the amount of narcotics seized in the period showed an

<P>
1997 is the second year for implementing the Ninth Five-Year
Plan (1996-2000) and attaining the long-range objective for the
year 2010.
</P>
<P>
It will be an important year in China's history, when China
will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and the
Communist Party of China (CPC) will convene its 15th National
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Resuming the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong will
constitute a great achievement in implementing the principle of
"One country, two systems," and represents the long-cherished wish
of many people throughout the past century, says the editorial.
</P>
<P>
This will certainly have a far-reaching impact on promoting the
reunification of the motherland and invigorating national spirit.
</P>
<P>
The 15th National Congress of the CPC will be held just as the
country is carrying forward the opening policy and socialist
modernization cause pioneered by former Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
Following the congress, the party will more effectively lead
the whole party and entire people of all nationalities to reach
the goal of socialist modernization.
</P>
<P>
The two great events, having attracted worldwide attention, are
of great significance in invigorating the motherland and for the
prosperity of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people should unite as one to complete their work
this year, creating favorable political, economical and social
environment and conditions for the two events, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
And they must fulfill the general requirements of the central
government for economic work in 1997: to maintain continuity,
stability, and necessary flexibility of macro-economic policies to
strive for progress while maintaining stability so as to promote
better development of reform and construction.
</P>
<P>
While adhering to the policy that takes economic construction
as the primary task for material progress, the Chinese people
should make greater efforts to encourage socialist cultural and
ethical progress and to strengthen the building of socialist
democracy and legal system, the editorial maintains.

HARARE, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Police Commissioner

<HEADLINE> China World Leader In Steel Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- China produced a record 100
million tons of steel this year, with its daily steel output
almost double the annual figure for 1949, when New China was
founded, and marking a milestone in its iron and steel industry.
</P>
<P>
China is a large iron and steel consumer and is able to supply
88 percent of its domestic needs for rolled steel, with more than
99 percent of its rolled steel sold over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
China's iron and steel industry began its sustained growth in
1978, when the country's steel output topped 30 million tons and
increased steel output from 60 million tons in 1989 to the
record-hitting 100 million tons this year.
</P>
<P>
There have been greater changes in the sector's industrial
arrangements, with converter steel reaching 70 percent of the
total steel output this year, up from 43 percent in 1978, and
bringing the open-furnace steel proportion down from 35 percent in
1978 to 12 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
China produced 53 million tons of continuous casting billets
this year, nearly 48 times the 1978 figure, raising the sector's
continuous casting ratio from 3.5 percent in 1978 to 53 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
In order to meet market needs, China produced 32.6 million tons
of steel sheet, pipe, and strip this year, which have been in
short supply in the past, 5.6 times the 1978 figure, and it now
can fulfil more than 60 percent of its needs for cold-rolled thin
sheets.
</P>
<P>
China now boasts 24 leading iron and steel-making enterprises
with annual steel output surpassing one million tons each. Their
combined output accounts for 70 percent of the country's total
steel output.

CAIRO, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Iraq will get tranquilizers,
antibiotics and pain killers from Egypt under a 1 million
U.S. dollar deal which goes into effect in February.
</P>
<P>
The contract is the first deal it concluded with an Egyptian
pharmaceutical company since resuming oil exports, the Egyptian
MENA news agency said today.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Company for Pharmaceutical Industries (EPICO)
signed the deal with the Iraqi Ministry of Health in Baghdad on
December 8-12.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, MENA reported that Iraq will buy at least 21 million
dollars worth of Egyptian vegetable shortening and soap.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Holding Company for Food Industries has concluded
two agreements with Iraq under the U.N. oil-for-food arrangement.

international embargo.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iraq has struck 13 contracts with about 20 companies
for exporting oil under the U.N. arrangement, which allows Iraq to
export 2 billion dollars worth of oil every six months.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has sealed its return as a marketing force in the oil-rich
Gulf after exporting two supertankers from its Mina al-Bakr
terminal since the deal took effect on December 10.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Export More Crude Oil to Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Iraq will export 3.5 million
tons of crude oil to Jordan in 1997, a 7 percent increase over
that in 1996, Jordanian Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources
Hashim Dabbas said here today.
</P>
<P>
The visiting minister said Jordan will offer Iraq 355 million
U.S. dollars worth of commodities in return.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, who arrived here Sunday heading a
Jordanian delegation, Iraq's crude oil export to Jordan in 1996
stood at 3.2 million tons and oil products at 1.2 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian delegation, which includes Finance Minister
Marwan Awad, agreed with Iraq in principle to build up an oil
pipeline between the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, both sides expressed their readiness to set
up a refinery in the Jordanian Red Sea port of Aqaba.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian minister stressed the importance of developing
bilateral relations in economy and finance with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's Oil Minister Amir Mohammed Rashid said that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein has given instructions to meet Jordan's
needs of oil and its derivatives in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
There is a clear sign of warming-up in the relations between
Iraq and Jordan since the implementation of Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food
deal earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iraq and Jordan cooled down drastically last
year after the defection to Jordan of two sons-in-law of President
Saddam Hussein. Consequently, Jordan's trade volume with Iraq
decreased to 220 million dollars from 400 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian delegation is expected to leave here Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Further Rural Banking Reforms In China In 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- China will standardize rural
credit agencies, reinforce their county-level centers, improve
rural cooperative funds, set up local branches of the Agricultural
Development Bank, and set up a new rural insurance system in the
new year.
</P>
<P>
This is to meet its agricultural reform and development needs,
Duan Xiaoxing, deputy director of the State Council
Inter-Department Coordinative Group for Rural Financial Reforms,
said during a recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Duan said the development of rural credit agencies has been
hampered by erroneous policies in the past and the reform is
intended to turn them into authentic cooperative credit agencies
that will be owned and managed by farmers and for farmers.
</P>
<P>
China has adopted a dual-level administrative system for rural
credit agencies, and the agencies' county-level centers should
play a bigger role, and much will be done to reinforce them, Duan
noted.
</P>
<P>
In discussing how to rectify rural cooperative funds, Duan
blamed local governments for setting the funds up without getting
the approval of the central bank. The majority of them have been
engaged in illegal banking activities such as loans and taking in
deposits, he explained.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the proposed rectification is aimed to put these
funds under legal contstraints, he noted, but acknowledged that
the job will be a tough one because of the large number of rural
people and institutions involved.
</P>
<P>
Duan said he predicts that by May all local branches of the
Agricultural Development Bank of China will be established, and
that the policy-related bank will play a due role of managing
policy funds for rural development.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Duan noted, a new insurance system to safeguard
agricultural production will be formed, because of the inability
of the existing insurers in the country to deal with risky
agriculture insurance.
</P>
<P>
Many domestic insurers have suffered heavy losses and are now
reluctant to provide services for clients in the agricultural
sector, Duan said.

<HEADLINE> New Tolls for Suez Canal in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The Suez Canal Authority (SCA)
will apply new transit dues on oil tankers and other ships using
the international waterway starting from January 1.
</P>
<P>
All maritime bodies dealing with the Suez Canal, have been
notified of the new fees, ASC Chief Ahmed Fadel said in Ismalia,
which is on the midway of the Canal and about 120 kilometers east
of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Transition tolls for oil tankers on round-trips, loaded and
unloaded, will be cut by 5 percent if the total quantity of oil on
board reaches one million metric tons or more, he said.
</P>
<P>
For oil tankers of 2 to 3 million metric tons, the reduction
would be 10 percent, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The tolls would be reduced 30 percent when tankers are carrying
more than 3 million metric tons for one dealer during 1997, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Privileges granted for the container ships included 1.83
special drawing rights (SDR) every net ton for 70,000 tons, if the
vessel is loaded, and 1.56 SDR if it is unloaded, Fadel said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a discount of 25 to 35 percent on Canal dues is to
be granted to loaded or unloaded LNG's (liquefied natural gas).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the transit dues for 1997 shall remain unchanged for
other types of ships in line with the tolls enforced since 1995,
according to the authority's earlier announcement.
</P>
<P>
One of Egypt's four largest foreign currency spinners, the
Canal garnered 2.1 billion U.S. dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The 193,000-kilometer Canal, which stretches south-north from
Suez to Port Said, is the world's longest canal without locks.
</P>
<P>
It is actually the first canal directly linking the
Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea. Egypt nationalized the canal on
26 July, 1956, almost 77 years after it was opened for
international navigation.
</P>
<P>
Compared with other waterways, there have been almost no
accidents in the Canal due to its security measures, according to
the SCA chief.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the completion of the first stage of the Canal
Development Project in 1975-1980, the waterway can now accommodate
all mammoth tankers in service on their ballast trips. It
witnessed the successful transit of the world biggest tanker
"Jahre Viking", 564,763 tons in draft weight.

<P>
In the coming year, all party members, especially leading
officials at various levels, should keep this situation in mind,
and redouble their efforts, working with one heart and one mind,
advancing towards development and progress.
</P>
<P>
"This is a fundamental requirement as well as a guarantee of
accomplishing the tasks for 1997," the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
Keeping the whole situation in mind means holding to Deng
Xiaoping's theories on building socialism with Chinese
characteristics and the Party's basic line, and implementing the
basic principles of seizing opportunities, increasing reforms,
opening wider to the outside world, and maintaining stability.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining social and political stability is a priority in
dealing with the overall situation. Problems must be identified
and handled from a political point of view, in order to understand
the overall relations of reforms, development, and stability, and
to coordinate the three and help them to benefit each other.
</P>
<P>
Making a redoubled effort suggests the need to achieve greater
progress, based on 1996's achievements in that first year of the
9th Five-Year Plan. An effort should be made in the two
fundamental shifts: that from the planned economy to the market
economy, and that from extensive to intensive operations. It is
also necessary that new and effective measures be developed that
will invigorate the economy and improve economic returns and
maintain appropriately rapid economic growth, it said.
</P>
<P>
Working with one heart and one mind means that the whole party
should conform to the Party central committee politically and
ideologically, safeguarding its authority and strictly
implementing its principles and policies. Words must match deeds
and orders, and prohibitions must be enforced in a strict way, the
editorial said.
</P>
<P>
"Only in this way can the party strengthen its combat readiness
and cohesion, and unite and lead all ethnic groups in advancing
towards the new objectives" the editorial said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Economy Grows by 6.5 Percent in 1996: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore economy grew
by 6.5 percent in 1996 and is expected to make steady growth of
5-7 percent in 1997, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said in his 1997
New Year Message today.
</P>
<P>
He said that in 1996 inflation remained low at 1.3 percent,
while wages grew by 6.1 percent. Incomes increased faster than the
cost of living as they have done for many years, he commented.
</P>
<P>
The economy slowed down in the second half of 1996, because of
the global electronics downturn and other cyclical factors, he
noted, adding that the inflow of foreign investments remained
strong.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing investment commitments reached a record of 8.1
billion Singapore dollars (about 5.79 billion US dollars) in 1996,
while commitments in the services clusters amounted to 1.5 billion
Singapore dollars (about 1.07 billion US dollars) in total
business spending, the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We should have no difficulty making steady growth of
5-7 percent in 1997."

To advance towards development and progress, the Chinese people
must take the initiative in the process of reform, and be creative
as they probe for solutions to difficult and important problems,
the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
With the restructuring of the economy at the crucial stage, the
country now faces the important asks of economic construction and
social development, the article emphasized.
</P>
<P>
To solve the deep-rooted contradictions in reform and
development, China must overcome all difficulties, inspire
enthusiasm among all the people, and open up new fields, it says.
</P>
<P>
Chinese people must open their minds, seek truth from facts,
and stick to factual practices as the only criteria by which to
test the truth. They should believe in people as a whole and rely
on them, and respect their creativity by adhering to the policy of
"from the masses, to the masses," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Finally, it called on all the party members and people of
different nationalities to more closely unite around the party
central committee with Jiang Zemin at the core, and adhere to the
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics and the basic principles and policies of the
Party.
</P>
<P>
It also asked that the people further implement the strategic
plannings of the party on reform, development and the promotion of
cultural and ethical progress, in order to achieve the country's
transcentury goals of economic and social progress.

<HEADLINE> Some 10-Percent Industrial Growth Recorded in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 31 (Xinhua) -- According to a recent study,
industrial growth in China's largest city was 9.6 percent annually
from 1985 to 1995, with great changes having taken place in the
city's industrial structure.
</P>
<P>
State-owned industries are still a dominant force to play a
leading role in basic and high-tech industrial sectors.
</P>
<P>
With a decade of adjustment, the city's industries have shifted
from labor- and resource-intensive production to technology- and
fund-intensive production, while a production mode dominated by
light and textile industries has been replaced by heavy and
chemical industries.
</P>
<P>
With adjustments in the industrial mix and technical progress,
the number of workers in the city has decreased. By the end of
1995, the municipality had 4.16 million industrial workers, a drop
of 50,000 people from 1985.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, the city had 279.91 billion yuan in fixed
industrial assets, 12.2 times the 1985 amount, according to the
bulletin.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that the city has seen great improvement
in its industrial products. By 1995, the percentage of products at
an international level was 24.2.
