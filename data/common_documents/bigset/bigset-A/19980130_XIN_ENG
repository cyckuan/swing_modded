<HEADLINE> Philippine Economy Grows Above Target in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Despite the present currency
crisis, the Philippine economy managed to grow above the target in
1997, but the government has prepared itself for the lingering
effects of the turmoil on some sectors in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Cielito Habito told reporters
Thursday that the country's gross national product (GNP) grew by
5.8 percent in 1997, slightly lower than the 6.9 percent growth
for 1996.
</P>
<P>
But last year's growth was better than 5.5 percent and 4.6
percent forecast by the government and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) respectively.
</P>
<P>
Habito said the gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 5.1
percent, ensuring that the overall economy kept grew steadily.
</P>
<P>
Industry posted the strongest performance among the production
sectors, growing by 5.7 percent, followed by the services sector
at 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The El Nino drought had however taken its toll on agriculture
whose growth slowed down to 2.8 percent compared with 3.1 percent
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Habito said the government is sticking to its 3 to 4 percent
growth target this year, which he considered conservative in view
of last year's much-higher growth rate.
</P>
<P>
This year's target is based on the assumption that the regional
financial turmoil, the high interest rate regime and the El Nino
persist in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Habito said the services sector would have the highest growth
rate of 4 to 5 percent this year, industry is likely to improve by
3 to 3.6 percent, while agriculture is expected to have a zero
growth rate because of the El Nino drought.
</P>
<P>
The government expects the inflation rate to move slightly
because of next month's minimum wage adjustment, oil price
adjustment and other factors, Habito said.

<HEADLINE> Democratic Party Quits Romanian Coalition Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The second largest partner of
the Romanian coalition government, the Democratic Party, announced
its departure from the coalition Thursday morning with five
ministers' resignation.
</P>
<P>
The party, however, said it will remain in the parliament to
continue the cooperation with other partners of the coalition.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrei Plesu, an independent,
who was nominated by the Democratic Party, will remain in his
position as requested by Romanian President Emil Constantinescu
and the Prime Minister Victora Ciorbea.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister Victora Ciorbea announced -- after the
departure of the democratic party -- that he will nominate five
candidates to replace the five ministers on Sunday or next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The remaining partners of the coalition government decided to
negotiate political cooperation in the future and planned to reach
an agreement before February 2.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the weeks long crisis was initiated by the
Democratic Party by denouncing Ciorbea as an impediment to
reforms, and requiring the Ciorbea government to resign before the
end of March and be replaced by a new "capable" government
composed by coalition partners.
</P>
<P>
On December 29, the Minister of Transport Traian Basescu who is
also the vice chairman of the Democratic Party was forced to
resign following his remarks that the Romanian government was
incompetent.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party insisted that Basescu resume his job. But
the the Prime Minister rejected Wednesday the Democratic Party's
request for Basescu's reinstatement.
</P>
<P>
The pullout by the Democratic Party has left Ciorbea at the
head of a minority Christian Democrat-led government which will
have a hard time in the future, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian coalition government was composed by the
Democratic Convention, the Social Democratic Union, and the
Hungarian Democratic Union.

<HEADLINE> Russian President Rejects Idea of Forming Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
on Thursday once again reaffirmed his negative attitude to the
idea of forming a coalition government in the country, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the State Duma Gennady Seleznyov handed Yeltsin a
concept for a coalition government during a Kremlin meeting
attended by the president, prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and
the chairmen of both houses of the parliament, Seleznyov and Yegor
Stroyev.
</P>
<P>
The president remained opposed to the idea of a coalition
government, which was proposed by Seleznyov in December last year.
Yeltsin rejected the proposal on January 16.
</P>
<P>
At Thursday'ss meeting the four top officials decided to put
off the question of national symbols, proposed by Yeltsin. They
agreed to remove the question from the political life of the
country.
</P>
<P>
It was decided that a special commission should closely study
the matter and make proposals.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting Yeltsin called for the speedy ratification
of the Russian-American START-2 treaty, saying "it fully meets the
national interests of Russia."

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 29 (Xinhua)-- South Korean negotiators have
reached agreement on restructuring their nation's short-term loans
with the United States and other creditors, U.S. bank sources said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which will let large South Korean banks
effectively delay making payments on loans worth about 24 billion
U.S. dollars, was reached here late last night after three weeks
of often tortuous negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Large payments on those loans would have been due in about
three months. Those loans will be swapped for new loans that are
to be paid back in one to three years under the new deal.
</P>
<P>
The deal granted the country an important reprieve in the
financial crisis that afflicted much of Asia since last july.
</P>
<P>
"The key thing is putting a financial backstop in place, and
that is what this agreement achieves," said Gene Frieda, an
emerging-markets specialist with I.D.E.A., a research firm based
in New York.
</P>
<P>
South Korea had been widely believed the world's 11th-largest
economy until a few months ago.

<P>
HARARE, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe and Japan signed here
today minutes of an agreement of a study mission to review
technical and economic cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed between Zimbabwe's senior finance
secretary Charles Kuwaza and special advisor of the Japanese
foreign affairs ministry Yasushi Kurokouchi follwing four days of
discussions on areas of development which Japan can assist
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The discussions were held between officials from the two
countries' ministries of finance, health, transport and energy,
information and telecommunications and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Kuwaza said the main areas
agreed upon were critical to poverty eradication and social and
economic development of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"This consensus in terms of the priority areas will enable
Zimbabwe to maximise the benefits from Japanese financial,
technical and other related support for sustainable social and
economic development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kurokouchi said the mission had recommended that Zimbabwe make
further efforts in its economic reforms because the Japanese were
now more concerned with the efficient and effective use of their
development assistance.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Retaliate Any Iraq Attacks, Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Israel reserves the right to
defend itself if it is attacked by Iraq, Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to factions leaders of coalition parties, Mordechai
said Israel is not involved in the standoff between the U.S.
and Iraq over the United Nations weapon inspection mission, but
it reserves the right to defend itself if being attacked.
</P>
<P>
He said the Israeli public needs not to be panic about the
Iraqi crisis, but should be prepared for any contingency.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
held consulations with U.S. Ambassador Edward Walker to discuss
the Iraqi crisis and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process ahead
of the visit here by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Albright is reportedly to brief Israel on the U.S. plan on a
possible attack on Iraq, and she will also try to nudge Israel and
the Palestinian side to advance the stalled peace talks. Israel
Radio reported that Israel is to get 24-hour advance notice if
Washington carries out military strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also convened a second meeting of the inner Cabinet
and another meeting of Likud ministers to discuss the Iraqi crisis
and the peace process. Mordechai as well as National
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon, and Industry and Trade
Minister Natan Sharansky attended the inner Cabinet session.
</P>
<P>
As the chance of a U.S. military strike against Iraq
increasing, Israel is closely monitoring the situation in order
to prepare for a possible retaliatory attack by Baghdad. In the
1991 Gulf War, Iraq launched dozens of Scud missiles against Tel
Aviv, causing no deaths but some property damages.
</P>
<P>
So far, Israeli officials have assured the public not to
be panic about the U.S.-Iraq military standoff and to continue
life as normal.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Israel has begun taking precautions to get
prepared for all eventualities. Israeli Home Command has advised
the public to check their gas masks and exchange the old
masks for new ones so to guard against possible biological or
chemical attacks. Since the weapon crisis surfaced last month,
Israel has been requiring citizens to update their masks.
</P>
<P>
Gabi Barabash, director-general of Health Ministry, said Israel
has all the necessary medical responses to the weapons in Iraqi
arsenal. He added that Israel would be ready for any Iraqi attack
as preparations could be ready within days.

<HEADLINE> Blair Rejects Possibility of Sacking Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said on Thursday he would not move Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook to a new post because of a controversy over his mistress.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister's view is that Robin Cook is an outstanding
foreign secretary," Blair's press spokesman told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"The coverage in the media has been pathetic, and he, and he
alone, will decide who is in his government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cook has been under criticism since he had sacked his diary
secretary, Anne Bullen, and had at one point considered replacing
her with Gaynor Regan, the woman he now plans to marry.
</P>
<P>
But he then changed his idea and decided to replace Bullen with
a career civil servant.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Express newspaper reported on Thursday that Blair was
believed to be considering switching Cook to another cabinet post
in a reshuffle expected in the middle of this year.
</P>
<P>
Blair's spokesman attacked the Express and other newspapers for
their reporting, saying: "There is a total lack of perspective
over this."

<P>
LONDON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A Northern Ireland loyalist
paramilitary group pledged on Thursday to halt its its random
attacks on Catholics from 11:55 pm.
</P>
<P>
But in a statement issued in Belfast, the Loyalist Volunteer
Force (LVF) said it would carry on with attacks "against known
republicans".
</P>
<P>
The campaign would go on until the Irish Republic dropped its
constitutional claim to Northern Ireland, the LVF said.
</P>
<P>
The LVF has carried out a series of revenge killings of
Catholics since its leader, Billy Wright, was gunned down by
members of a republican splinter group in the Maze prison on
December 27. Ten people, eight of them Catholics, died as a result
of the killings.
</P>
<P>
The LVF is the only loyalist group not officially upholding a

<P>
LONDON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- London's Heathrow airport
remained well ahead of its European competitors last year in
passenger volume.
</P>
<P>
Figures released here on Thursday by Airports Council
International (ACI) Europe showed Heathrow as the busiest with
58.1 million passengers handled last year. This was up 3.8 percent
from 1996.
</P>
<P>
Frankfurt came second with 40.3 million, up 3.9 percent, but
Paris Charles de Gaulle showed 10.7 percent growth to reach 35.2
million, and Amsterdam Schiphol 13.8 percent to 32 million.
</P>
<P>
Others to show rapid expansion were Brussels, up 17.9 percent
at 15.9 million, Munich 14.1 percent at 17.9 million, Barcelona
13.7 percent at 15.3 million and Milan Linate 13.5 percent at 14.3
million.
</P>

Frankfurt, up 2.6 percent at 1.25 million tonnes, and Amsterdam
Schiphol, up 7.4 percent at 1.18 million.

<HEADLINE> UK Lags Behind On Security Spending In EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 29 (Xinhua) - Britain spends relatively little
on health and social security, according to official figures
released here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 edition of Social Trends, the Government's annual
report of social and economic statistics, puts Britain at ninth of
11 European Union states ranked by expenditure on social
protection benefits.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the figures call into question
ministers' concerns about the rising cost of the welfare state.
</P>
<P>
Britain is shown to spend less than half what Denmark allocates
to social protection. Very little of what it does spend goes
towards help for families and children.
</P>
<P>
The findings have been underscored by comments by Chris Daykin,
the government actuary, that Britain has no real problem of
welfare costs by comparison with most other countries.
</P>
<P>
In an address to politicians and insurance industry experts on
Tuesday, Daykin said Britain's outlook was "very controlled and
stable" by international standards.
</P>
<P>
Barely any increase in spending would be needed to underwrite
the existing system over the next seven years, he estimated.
</P>
<P>
Taking together all spending on old age, sickness, unemployment
and disability, Britain is shown to spend less than 3000 pounds
(4800 U.S. dollars) a head annually, France almost 5000 pounds
(8000 U.S. dollars) and Denmark almost 7000 pounds (11200 U.S.
dollars).

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Rejects Japanese Envoy's Proposal for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIGALI, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government has been
angered by the proposal of the Japanese Ambassador to Rwanda
resident in Nairobi, Shinsuke Horiuchi, that negotiations should
take place between the government and armed Hutu insurgents.
</P>
<P>
"The fighting must be stopped and negotiations for sustained
peace must start," Hariuchi declared on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking during a ceremony at which Japan donated 4.7
tons of rice to the Rwandan government, which worth 300 million
Yen (about 2.38 million US Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Japanese diplomat had urged the government to sit down and
talk with Hutu militia who were accused of committing the 1994
genocide of more than one million Tutsis and Hutu moderates.
</P>
<P>
Hariuchi further threatened to cut off any future aid if this
donation that was meant for reconstruction was diverted "to
indirectly prolong the civil strife."
</P>
<P>
Anastase Gasan, Rwanda's Minister of Foreign Affairs, slammed
Hariuchi's proposal and regretted that it had emanated from a
member of the UN Security Council which also has a terrible
historical background.
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate that, considering the Japanese historical
background, the Japanese Ambassador to Rwanda should propose
negotiations with genocidal forces," the foreign minister
underscored in his statement.

LONDON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair announced on Thursday a fresh inquiry into the "Bloody
Sunday" incident in Londonderry in 1972 in which 14 people were
killed.
</P>
<P>
He said an international panel of three senior judges will form
the tribunal to conduct the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
"The aim of the inquiry is not to accuse individuals or
institutions or invite fresh recriminations, but to establish the
truth about what happened on that day, so far as that can be
achieved at 26 years' distance," Blair told the parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said he had not forgotten all the other victims of violence
in Northern Ireland but an inquiry was "only course that will lead
to public confidence".
</P>
<P>
"It is in the interests of everyone that the truth is
established and told," he said, adding it was also the way
"forward to the necessary reconciliation which will be such an
important part of building a secure future for the people of
Northern Ireland. I ask all sides of the House to support our
proposal for this inquiry."
</P>

demonstrators following a march in Londonderry 26 years ago.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Begins Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate Thursday
began its work for the year, confirming three federal judges.
</P>
<P>
The confirmations still left 85 vacant federal judgeships,
about 10 percent of the total. Republicans say the situation is
not unusual but Democrats called it a crisis generated by
Republicans blocking "liberal" judges.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, in his State of the Union address
Tuesday night, quoted a year-end report by Chief Justice William
Rehnquist as expressing concern about the high level of vacancies
"eroding the quality of justice." Police and prosecutors, Clinton
said, "can't work if the court system doesn't work."
</P>
<P>
The Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, Senator Orrin Hatch, a
Republican, insisted his panel was handling nominations
appropriately and said the White House shared the blame for any
backlog because of its slowness in making nominations. "It's
pretty fallacious to blame the Senate when in many instances we
don't have any nominees for the positions."
</P>
<P>
The White House announced 12 nominations Tuesday, bringing to
54 the number pending before the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Angola, Russia to Restore Military Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Russia will cement its ties
with Angola by restoring bilateral cooperation in military
technology in the near future.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed Thursday by Vladimir Pakhomov, Russia's
Deputy Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, upon his
arrival here at the airport.
</P>
<P>
He announced that it is the common wish of both Russia and
Angola to restore and strengthen military ties. During his
five-day visit, said the Russian official, the two sides will
seal a protocol for cooperation in military technology so as to
lay a legal foundation for further bilateral military
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
According to Pakhomov, military agreements between the two
countries had been confined to the implementation of individual
projects, which do not fit the current situation. The upcoming
protocol will be an expansive one which will open up great
prospects for bilateral military ties.
</P>
<P>
Pakhomov also revealed that the two sides will explore the
possibility of Russia's repairing and improving Angola's existing
military facilities which were made by Russia.
</P>
<P>
The military relationship between Angola and Russia started in
1970s and has been enhanced since. However, due to the end of
the cold war and the dissolution of the former Soviet Union,
bilateral military cooperation has been greatly crippled.

<HEADLINE> Fed Chief Says U.S. Economy Begins to Feel Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy has just
begun to feel the impact of the economic and financial crisis in
Asia and will slow noticeably "before Spring is over," the U.S.
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan stated Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We have as yet experienced only the peripheral winds of the
Asian crisis," Greenspan told the Senate Budget Committee in his
first congressional appearance in three months.
</P>
<P>
He said, before Spring is over, sharp currency devaluations in
Asia will affect this country through "reductions in demand for
our exports and intensified competition from imports."
</P>
<P>
"All of this suggests that the growth of economic activity in
this country will moderate from the recent brisk pace," he added.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan's last congressional appearance came in late October
just days after the Asian crisis provoked a record 554-point drop
in the Dow Jones average of industrial stocks.
</P>
<P>
A moderation in economic growth "would appear helpful at this
juncture," Greenspan said. "The likelihood that we shall be seeing
some lower prices on imported goods as a result of the
difficulties in Asia may afford some breathing room from inflation
pressures."
</P>
<P>
As recently as early October, Greenspan was warning that labor
shortages created by last year's robust economic growth threatened
to put the economy on "an unsustainable track."
</P>
<P>
But Greenspan Thursday cited risks to the economy from both
inflation and from too-rapid disinflation.
</P>
<P>
Lower import prices "will not permanently supress the risks
inherent in tightened labor markets," he said. The risk is that
labor shortages will drive wages up faster, forcing businesses to
raise their prices more rapidly.
</P>
<P>
However, Greenspan also noted, "a continuation of the Asian
crisis should give us pause in assuming that our economy will
remain robust indefinitely." "As a consequence, we must be
vigilant to the reemergence of destabilizing influences _ both
higher inflation, and shortfalls in demand and decreases in some
prices that would press the disinflation process too far, too
fast."

<HEADLINE> Scientist Plans to Create Mice Which Make Human Sperm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A leading reproductive biologist
plans to explore the possibility of growing human sperm inside the
body of mice in an attempt to help infertile men, New Scientist
magazine reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Roger Short of the Royal Women's hospital in Melbourne,
Australia, has already won ethical approval for the work from his
local animal research committee, and has applied for funding from
the U.S. National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
However, the technique could help some men who produce little
or no sperm, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
While many female infertility problems can be overcome, men
with low sperm counts have little chance of conceiving.
</P>
<P>
In many cases, said Short, the cause of infertility in men may
be a mutation in one of the genes on the Y chromosome the control
the production of sperm from germ cells.
</P>
<P>
Being able to study human sperm making in a laboratory animal
may help researchers to work out why the process fails in many
infertile men.
</P>
<P>
If the fault lies with the special cells that nurture
developing sperm, then a transplant of germ cells in human testes
to a mouse with healthy nurturing cells could allow mature human
sperm to form.
</P>
<P>
Short's proposal, which is the latest in a procession of
dramatic reproductive experiments, has aroused safety concerns
among other fertility experts.
</P>
<P>
Human sperm developed in a mouse test might undergo changes
producing congenital defects, and human sperm could be infected by
mouse viruses, experts said.

DAVOS, SWITZERLAND, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Human rights should
be a priority for the 21st century, Swiss President Flavio Cotti
stated here Thursday at the opening session of the 1998 annual
meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF).
</P>
<P>
On the annual meeting's theme of Priorities for the 21st
Century, Cotti told the participants that the next century should
be a century of human rights.
</P>
<P>
"Human rights are without doubt an issue of politics, as well
as an issue of international cooperation, involving religious as
well as other humanitarian organizations," Cotti said.
</P>
<P>
However, he believed that human rights also have an economic
dimension.
</P>
<P>
"Your position seems far more and far better suited to
introducing very concrete human-rights issues into the dialogue
between politics and business, without at the same time
compromising your entrepreneurial objectives," Cotti told the
audience.
</P>
<P>
"In this way, your contribution to making the 21st century a
century of human rights in reality can be decisive," he added.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Expects Euro to be Currency of Lasting Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, SWITZERLAND, January 29 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl said here Thursday that he expected the euro to be a
currency of lasting stability.
</P>
<P>
Opening the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, Kohl
said, "This is assured by the independence of the European Central
Bank, whose foremost task will be to maintain that stability."
</P>
<P>
He told the plenary session that the euro will also be
guaranteed by the strict stability criteria of the Maastricht
Treaty as well as the Stability Pact designed to keep budgetary
policy on a sound footing.
</P>
<P>
The German chancellor was optimistic about the economic future
of Germany and Europe because the euro's punctual launching on
January 1, 1999, will give investors more planning security
because it will eliminate the exchange rate risk for member
countries, saving companies all over Europe about 90 billion marks
a year.
</P>
<P>
"All speculation about the membership of the Monetary Union is
superfluous," Kohl stressed. "There is a fixed time-table. Every
country has to do its homework."
</P>
<P>
He cautioned that only those "who pass the examinations will
receive their certificates" at the commencement ceremony in May.

PARIS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine Thursday exchanged views on the on-going crisis in Iraq
with his Iranian counterpart Kamal Kharazi during a meeting in
Geneva, reported Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
But French diplomatic sources said there is no Franco-Iranian
initiative over Iraq and neither of the foreign ministers made any
declaration after the three-hour meeting, said AFP.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine travelled to Switzerland to meet with Kharazi, who was
in Geneva to attend the Davos World Economic Forum, as both of
them agreed to meet again in Europe during a previous meeting in
New York, according to AFP.
</P>
<P>
Both France and Iran are opposed to a military strike by the
United States and Britain against Iraq for Baghdad's refusal to
cooperate with United Nations arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Iraq and the situation in the Mideast, the two
foreign ministers also discussed the situation in Algeria, as well
as the development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux said Thursday
that the meeting between Vedrine and Kharazi shows the intention
of the European Union to help Iran go out of its diplomatic
isolation.

MOSCOW, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Russian spacecraft "Soyuz
TM-27" took off from Baikonur, Kazakhstan, at 19:33 Moscow time
and reached a low-earth orbit on Thursday, according to the
Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
The spacecraft, which is carrying on board two Russian

</P>
<P>
The mission control center at the town of Korolyov outside
Moscow was quoted as saying that for an hour, Endeavor will circle
Mir to photograph and videotape the station.
</P>
<P>
And at 21:07 Moscow time, it is to start heading away from Mir.
The shuttle is scheduled to land on Sunday at 13:36 M.t.
</P>
<P>

<P>
PARIS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- France is wavering in its
opposition to a military strike against Iraq by the United States,
and has hinted that it will not condemn such a strike.
</P>
<P>
French Defense Minister Alain Richard told the press Thursday
afternoon that although Paris prefers a "diplomatic treatment"
of the Iraqi crisis, it does not oppose "a certain amount of
pressure" against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"For the treatment of this crisis, the point of view of France
is a treatment which does not privilege operations of force but a
treatment of diplomatic character. This does not exclude of course
a certain amount of pressure which is under discussion." he said.
</P>
<P>
The United State Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was
holding talks with her French counterpart Hubert Vedrine Thursday
night in Paris on the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
Albright is touring Europe to convince European countries the
need to launch a possible military action against Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The daily Le Monde said that French officials have almost given
up their hope that Saddam Hussein will accept a compromise by
letting United Nations arms inspectors to visit presidential
sites.
</P>
<P>
Some French officials said that it seems Saddam Hussein wants a
military strike against Iraq so that he can no longer accept U.N.
arms inspections, said Le Monde.
</P>
<P>
But French officials doubt that a military strike will be
effective in stopping Iraq from developing arms of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
France is also concerned that a military action against Iraq
will discredit the efforts being made by the United States and
Europe for a revival of the Mideast peace process.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor Asks for Delay in Jones Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr today asked a federal judge to delay the Paula Jones sexual
harassment lawsuit because lawyers in that case are interfering
with his criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
In a motion filed today, Starr said attorneys in the Jones case
are attempting to "shadow" his investigation to gather additional
information. He wants the discovery process halted immediately.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright has set the Jones trial
for May 27.
</P>
<P>
Starr says, "The pending criminal investigation is of such
gravity and paramount importance that this court would do a
disservice to the nation if it permitted the unfettered and
extraordinarily aggressive discovery efforts currently under way
to proceed unabated."
</P>
<P>
Starr complained about activity by attorneys on both sides of
the civil lawsuit against President Bill Clinton. The lawsuit
alleges Clinton propositioned Jones in May 1991 when she was a
state clerk and he was governor of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
Starr says, "It has now become apparent that both parties to
the civil action... are attempting to take strategic advantage of
the ongoing criminal investigation to their own benefit, with the
inevitable effect of disturbing this investigation."
</P>
<P>
Starr is investigating allegations of Clinton's sexual
involvement with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and a
possible cover-up. Witnesses are being called before a federal
grand jury in the probe. Some of those witnesses are being
subpoenaed by lawyers in the Jones case.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Most of Zambian parliament
members Thursday voted for the extension of the state of
emergency law for another three months.
</P>
<P>
One hundred and thirteen parliament members voted for the
extension with eight against it, and independent parliament
members staying away.
</P>
<P>
Bringing the motion to parliament voting, Vice President
Christon Tembo said that investigation into the October 28 foiled
coup has not completed and the government requires more time to
complete it.
</P>
<P>
Opposing the motion, one opposition party parliament member
said the government's reason for the extension of state of
emergency law is questionable, as 138 of the 157 parliament
members are from the country's ruling party.
</P>
<P>
The state of emergency law was imposed on after the coup
attempt.
</P>
<P>
A total of 95 people have been arrested since the coup
including former President Kenneth Kaunda.
</P>
<P>
Following international appeals for Kaunda's immediate release
or an early law process, the government transferred Kaunda to
house arrest on December 31 of 1997, six days after his arrest in
alleged involvement in the coup.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Oppose US Military Action on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian people oppose
any U.S. military action against Iraq, a member of the Palestinian
Council said in Gaza on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq does not pose any threat to its neighbors, nor does it
have chemical weapons and there is no reason for the United States
to continue its aggressive policy toward Iraq, Israel Radio quoted
Khader Tahboub as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tahboub's remarks were a clear signal to the U.S. that many
Palestinian leading personnel and people are not in favor of
U.S. military strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the United States is to gain the control of Iraq's
oil reserves, Tahboub said, adding that he will always support
Iraq against the United States.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the United States for its attempt to launch
a new military attack against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The confrontation between Iraq and the United States has been
recently intensified as Iraq proposed to freeze any discussions or
actions with respect to U.N. arms inspector's access to
presidential sites while the United States threatened to use force
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
So far only Britain openly expressed its support for the
United States to take military action against Iraq, but other
countries, such as France and Russia, persisted in calling for
more diplomacy to solve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
In order to gain support from other nations, U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright is travelling in Europe before visiting
the Middle East. She is scheduled to discuss this issue with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat during the next two days.
</P>
<P>
Considering Israel's difficult political environment in the
region, Albright may ask Israel to stay out of the Iraq crisis
during her talks with Israeli leaders.
</P>
<P>
Albright would also ask Arafat to switch sides, at least not to
openly express his support for Iraq in the event of U.S. military
attack against that country.
</P>
<P>
But it would not be prudent for Albright to ignore the
existence of the Palestinian Committee of Solidarity with the
People of Iraq or the words of its Chairman Abdullah Hourani, who
said recently that "Iraq's interests live in the hearts of every
Arab and every Palestinian".

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Will not Run for Third Presidential Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said Friday that he would not run for a third term in the year of
2000, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting at the Kremlin with Russian media executives, the
president said he won't violate the constitution by running again.
</P>
<P>
Russia's 1993 basic law limits candidates to two terms in
office. But some presidential aides have insisted that Yeltsin
could still run in 2000 as his first period in office was served
under the previous, Soviet-era constitution.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said the
constitutional court had yet to make a definitive ruling on how to
interpret the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also disclosed that he has made up his mind on a
possible successor. "My opinion about a possible successor has
been formed. Now I have one problem facing me: when to reveal it?"
</P>
<P>
"Even the candidate does not know. He may dream about it, but
he does not know," said Yeltsin, adding that "it's pointless
getting society worked up about this question" two years ahead of
the election.
</P>
<P>
The president also said, "The Chernomyrdin-led government
should be preserved. "The cabinet should be stablized and perhaps
one or two replacements should be made," he said.

<HEADLINE> Religious Freedom Guaranteed in Tibet (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The policy of freedom of religion
is guaranteed and fully practiced in the Tibet Autonomous Region,
according to Bomi Qambalozhub, president of the Tibetan Branch of
the Buddhism Association of China.
</P>
<P>
In a recent Xinhua interview, the Living Buddha said that
reality proves the validity of the fundamental long-term policies
of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
Bomi, 80, who also serves as vice-president of the Chinese
Buddhist Association, noted that Westerners with ulterior motives
have spread groundless claims that China has adopted a policy of
destroying religion and culture in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
"The Central Government and local government in Tibet have
extended great effort to ensure religious freedom by spending
more than 300 million yuan over the past 17 years renovating
Buddhist temples and monasteries in the region," Bomi said.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,787 temples and Buddhist sites have been reopened or
renovated, including the Potala Palace, Zhebung Temple, and the
Sera Gandian, Sagya and Johkang monasteries, said Bomi, adding that
all temples are open to Buddhists.
</P>
<P>
The total number of temples and monasteries in Tibet has jumped
by well over 300 venues since the peaceful liberation of Tibet in
1951, said Bomi.

Bomi said that some 46,300 Buddhist monks and nuns live and
work in temples and monasteries.
</P>
<P>
He said that various major Tibetan Buddhist festivals have
resumed in recent years, including the Sagadawa, a festival
celebrating the Birth and Nirvana of the Buddha.
</P>
<P>
Bomi said the establishment of the Publishing House of Buddhist
Sutras in Lhasa, capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, has led
to publication of the Kagyur, or the translated teachings of the
Buddha, and various other Buddhist works housed in all temples and
monasteries throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
He addressed the political status of devout Buddhism believers
in Tibet by noting hat some 600 Buddhists have been elected as
deputies to local People's Congresses, or as members of local
committees of people's political consultative conferences at
various levels.
</P>
<P>
Bomi, who holds the title of Gexe Iga-ram-Pageshe, the
highest degree of Lamaist scholarship and is highly respected by
lamas and Buddhist believers, presided over the ceremony for
drawing lots from the golden urn to mark confirmation of
reincarnated soul boy of the 10th Panchen Lama. He also attended
the ceremony when the 11th Panchen Lama's ascended to the holy
throne.
</P>
<P>
Bomi said that the grand Buddhist ceremony held in Tibet fully
reflected implementation of Central Government policies on
protecting religious freedom in Tibet.

<HEADLINE> Russia to See Better Economic Growth in 1998: Chubais </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, Switzerland, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Russia's First
Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais predicted here Friday that
his country's economic growth in 1998 will be higher than in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"1997 was the year when major fundamental trends in Russia
completely changed from negative to positive," Chubais told
reporters during the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in
the Davos Congress Center.
</P>
<P>
Russia's GDP growth of 0.4 percent in 1997, though still low,
is the first positive figure since 1988, Chubais said. The
industrial output was at 0.9 percent last year and the inflation
rate for the whole year was 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
Chubais predicted that the GDP growth in 1998 will be between 2
to 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the emerging euro, Chubais said he did not
exclude the possibility of Russia joining the European Monetary
Union in the future.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about a decision to raise the
interest rate, the 42-year-old deputy prime minister said the
decision was meant to slow the flow of Russia's currency, the
rouble, out of the country.
</P>
<P>
In November and December of 1997, the flow reached four billion
U.S. dollars because of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Chubais said that Russia's goal in 1998 is to lower the
interest rate to 15 to 20 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The giant Shanghai
Petrochemical will account for 40 percent of China's output of
acrylic after acquiring Zhejiang Acrylic Fiber.
</P>
<P>
By buying 75 percent of the debt-ridden Zhejiang plant at a
cost of 40 million yuan (4.819 million U.S. dollars), Shanghai
Petrochemical -- China's leading acrylic fiber supplier, is
expected to push its annual acrylic fiber output to 130,000 tons
from the present 89,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang Acrylic Fiber, built with an investment of about 800
million yuan and becoming operational in 1995, is also a major
acrylic fiber producer. Its recent financial difficulties were
blamed on poor management and unfavorable market conditions.
</P>
<P>
After the acquisition, Zhejiang Acrylic Fiber is entitled to
preferential terms offered by the government, including breaks in
debt interests, delays in debt payment and a seven-year exemption
from bank-loan interest.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Petrochemical has already sent a management team to
help restore production and to plan the technical transformation
of the Zhejiang plant, which is expected to turn a profit by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the 25 percent stake of Zhejiang Acrylic Fiber will
be retained by its former owner -- the Zhejiang Provincial
Economic Construction Investment Corp. (20 percent) and the Ningbo
City Economic Construction Investment Corp. (5 percent).

WASHINGTON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright held talks with the
French Foreign Minister and then spoke of France's preference for
a diplomatic solution to the crisis with Iraq. But Albright and
Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine issued coordinated remarks
designed to insure that Saddam Hussein knows that the time for a
diplomatic capitulation is now.
</P>
<P>
-- The credibility of the experiment reporting the cloning of
Dolly the sheep from the cell of an adult ewe is being challenged
by a leading biologist, and other eminent scientists agree that
the experiment needs to be repeated before it can be accepted.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton's damage-control advisers have concluded
that the public's initial shock about the Monica Lewinsky
controversy has subsided sufficiently that they can pursue a
policy of withholding information about Clinton's relationship
with the former White House intern indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
-- House Majority Leader K. Army announced a bill banning human
cloning Thursday, saying "cloning is the way amoebas produce -- it
was never intended for man." He said the proposed legislation
strengthened the Clinton administration's proposal for a ban on
cloning in that it would make research on cloning by private
individuals illegal.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan signaled that he
would hold interest rates steady for the foreseeable future,
partly because the impact of the Asian economic crisis remains
unclear. He described the U.S. economy as "exceptionally healthy"
in testimony before a Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
-- The Whitewater prosecutor Starr hit an impasse in his
efforts to get Lewinsky to cooperate against Clinton. The
breakdown in immunity talks with the former White House intern
puts in doubt Starr's access to testimony by the central figure in
sex allegations against the president.

<P>
BANGKOK, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The value of the Thai currency,
the baht, rose steadily Friday shortly after the Bank of Thailand
ended the practice of separating the baht exchange rate at the
domestic bourse from that at foreign currency markets.
</P>
<P>
The baht was exchanged at 51.5 against the U.S. dollar both at
the Bangkok bourse and the London stock market, a 5.24-percent
rise over that of Thursday, according to Channel-Nine TV of
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Chawat Wilbulswasdi, governor of the Bank of Thailand, said
linking baht exchange rates at domestic and foreign bourses will
help stabilize the exchange rate of the baht against the
greenback.
</P>
<P>
Thai Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda told reporters that
the linkage will help restore confidence of foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the linkage, the Stock Exchange of Thailand index
Friday gained 47.99 points, or 10.7 percent from Thursday to close
at 495.23.
</P>
<P>
Thailand separated the baht exchange rate at the domestic
bourse with that at foreign currency markets last summer after the
floatation of the baht.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Environmentalists Condemn Eating Monkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian
environmentalists have lashed out at the ill practice of eating
monkey meat, which makes the population of the animal drop
drastically in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Impoverished residents in Ruvuma near Tanzania's southern
border with Mozambique prefer to eat monkey meat which are even
cheaper than beef and mutton, the Business Times revealed Friday.
</P>
<P>
A kilogram of beef or goat meat sells at 1,000 Shillings (1.67
US Dollars), while a kilogram of monkey meat is priced at 450
Shillings, which is less than one Dollar.
</P>
<P>
Although killing of monkeys is prohibited in Ruvuma, local
residents, with an annual average income of less than 100,000
Shillings per capita, have been eating monkey meat on the sly for
decades, and claimed that the meat is delicious.
</P>
<P>
Esau Sonoko, regional wildlife officer in Ruvuma, said the
practice is threatening the survival of several monkey species
there.
</P>
<P>
While the region boasted hundreds of thousands of monkeys a
few years ago, the number has dropped to tens of thousands.
</P>
<P>
"My department is planning to institute a strategy that will
ensure that the animal is protected against poachers," the paper
quoted the official as saying.
</P>
<P>
So far four people have been arrested for selling monkey meat,
he said, adding that continuous booking of the culprits will
discourage the trade and save the animals from extinction.

PARIS, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The trial of former Vichy official Maurice Papon by a court
in Bordeaux was troubled by accusation by a lawyer, Arno
Klarsfeld, that the president of the court has family link with
one of the Jewish families deported in December 1943 to Nazi death
camps from Gironde, southwest France. Papon, who was in charge of
the "Jewish files" during Nazi occupation of Gironde from 1942 to
1944, was accused of crimes against humanity for ordering the
deportation of 6,900 Jews.
</P>
<P>
-- The Americans are drawing a lesson from the turmoil from the
latest White House sex scandal in which President Bill Clinton
allegedly had an affair with a former White House intern, Monica
Lewinsky. Americans are considering a "French solution" to any
similar event in the future -- that is, not to care about what
happens in the bedroom of their political leaders.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- An investigative report by a Figaro reporter said that the
town of Bagneux in the suburb of Paris has been turned into a drug
market by drug dealers, who are controlling an underground economy
and are imposing their law on the local population silenced by
terror. Drug addicts of Paris and other places go there several
times a day to buy drugs, sold with "flash sale" technique.
</P>
<P>
-- While Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov Thursday
expressed "optimism" over a diplomatic solution to the Iraqi
crisis, the spokesman of the U.S. President, Michael McCurry, said
that the trip to Baghdad by a Russian presidential envoy
apparently has not made any breakthrough. U.S. President Bill
Clinton will call French President Jacques Chirac Friday afternoon
on the Iraqi crisis.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Refutes Clinton and Albright's Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Iraq will not use weapons of
mass destruction for the simple reason that it does not possess
any of such weapons, said the Iraqi Culture and Information
Minister Hummam Abdul-Khaliq Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister was responding to remarks made by U.S.
President Bill Clinton that the U.S. will not allow Iraq to use
its weapons of mass destruction, the Iraqi news agency INA
reported.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said "We are determined to deny him (Saddam) the
capacity to use weapons of mass destruction again" when meeting
with top U.S. military commanders from around the world gathering
at Fort McNair near Washington.
</P>
<P>
Khaliq said that Iraq did not use those weapons when it was
possessing some, specially the chemical ones, during the
"U.S.-sponsored military aggression on Iraq" in 1991 despite all
the unprecedented means of destruction and killing ferociously
used by the allied forces against the country.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister said that Clinton and his assistants know
this fact very well. However, they are working hard to justify
their new campaign of aggression against the Iraqi people with no
legal or legitimate justification nor an Iraqi threat to
U.S. interests or any other state's, said Khaliq.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Thursday that
diplomatic efforts to end the crisis between Iraq and UNSCOM
(U.N. Special Commission on disarmament in Iraq) are almost to
be exhausted.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Albright's remarks, Khaliq asked why the
United States, as a party in this crisis, still rejects any
dialogue with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The United States is actively preparing for a military strike
against Iraq on the ground that Iraq does not comply with Security
Council resolutions by denying U.N arms inspectors access to
presidential sites.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has proposed to freeze discussions or actions regarding
inspectors' access to presidential sites until April when results
of technical evaluation meetings participated by international
experts come out. The U.S. is firmly opposed to the Iraqi proposal.
</P>
<P>
Khaliq accused Clinton and his ministers and assistants of
exaggerating too much the Iraq-U.N. stand-off with the view to
justifying the military action they are planning to launch
against the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of U.N. inspectors are being dispatched on many UNSCOM
teams which are doing their work and practicing monitoring
operations throughout Iraq in a round-the-clock system which is
one of the most sophisticated in the world, said the minister.

"We decided to allot new Korea-China routes earlier than
planned to help deficit-ridden national flag carriers improve
their business," said Sohn Soon-ryong, director general of the
ministry's aviation affairs.
</P>
<P>
Korean Air and Asiana Airlines are faced with severe
difficulties due to the weak South Korean currency and declining
number of tourists.
</P>
<P>
While suspending or reducing flights to Europe and North
America, both national flag carriers are competing for more new
Korea-China routes.
</P>
<P>
Ministry experts estimate that some 70 million Chinese are rich
enough to enjoy overseas trips to South Korea.

<HEADLINE> Female Highway Workers Battle Blizzards in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAINGOIN, TIBET, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Female highway
maintenance crews in northern Tibet are busy clearing snow-covered
roads while people throughout China celebrate the traditional
Lunar New Year, which fell on January 28.
</P>
<P>
The female crew responsible for the highway in Baingoin County
has endured a succession of heavy snowstorms since last September.
</P>
<P>
Areas suffering from heavy accumulations of snow have received
disaster relief supplies provided by the central government and
donated by people from both at home and abroad. Nonetheless, harsh
natural conditions have hindered the smooth flow of related
materials.
</P>
<P>
"People living in the hardest hit areas are suffering from
severe cold and hunger. We feel obliged to keep the highway open
to ensure that materials reach people in need," according a team
member by the name of Kyaizhub.
</P>
<P>
A heavy snowstorm in mid-January blocked the mountain road
leading to the area most affected by blizzards, with
over 10 trucks carrying relief supplies stranded at the foot of
the mountain.
</P>
<P>
Nine members of the maintenance crew ignored the extreme
hardship at altitudes of over 5,000 meters and rushed to the
area to clear the highway.
</P>
<P>
The crew worked almost non-stop for more than ten days and
finally managed to open the highway. Most of the women suffered
from frostbite, and a number suffered from snow blindness.
</P>
<P>
The oldest member is 45 and the youngest 25.
</P>
<P>
Gaiyang, the youngest member of the crew, was forced to leave
her infant son at home to perform her duties on treacherous
mountain roads.
</P>
<P>
"Fatigue means nothing. We're simply happy to see trucks filled
with relief materials negotiate the mountain pass," said Gyamco,
the oldest member of the crew.

<HEADLINE> 10 Ailing South Korean Merchant Banks Closed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 30 (Xinhua) -- South Korea on Friday announced
the closure of 10 of 14 ailing merchant banks whose business
operations were suspended after the financial crisis in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
Under the results of a committee's appraisal over the
management of the 10 banks, the South Korean government decided to
revoke the business licenses of the banks because their debts
exceeded their assets, said a spokesman of the Ministry of Finance
and Economy.
</P>
<P>
The 10 banks are Hanwha, Ssangyong, Gyongnam, Coryo, Samsam,
Hangdo, Chungsol, Shinsegae, Shinhan and Kyungil.
</P>
<P>
The closure of the banks, analysts said, will deal a serious
blow to the domestic financial market and business circles. Their
combined loans to enterprises amounted to 33 trillion won (2.2
billion U.S. dollars) at the end of November, or 24.6 percent of
the nation's 30 merchant banks' total credit of 134 trillion won.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Korea Stock Exchange Friday
suspended stock trading in nine of the 10 merchant banks following
the ministry's decision. Kyungil Merchant Bank is not listed on
the local stock market.
</P>
<P>
The order is seen as the South Korean government's initial step
to shut down ailing merchant banks under an agreement signed with
the International Monetary Fund for a bailout loan of 57 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The government is expected to close additional merchant banks
before March after conducting in-depth screening of the financial
status of the remaining 20 merchant banks.
</P>
<P>
All merchant banks have to meet the capital adequacy ratio of 4
percent by the end of March 1998, 6 percent by the end of June,
and 8 percent by the end of June 1999, set by the Bank of
International Settlements, in order to continue operation.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Govt Urged to Protect Old Forest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 30 (Xinhua) -- A Tanzanian district
forest officer has expressed fears that the Pugu forest Reserve
near Dar Es Salaam will disappear because of frequent human
activities, The Guardian reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Charles Secha, forest officer for Kisarawe district, told the
newspaper that the government must take urgent measures to save
the 2,410-hectare forest, located in the Coast Region.
</P>
<P>
Secha said it is difficult for his office to work with acute
shortage of manpower, lack of working tools and funds.
</P>
<P>
Despite its fame that it is among the oldest forests in the
world and one with endemic species, he said, the Pugu forest
reserve is likely to perish as it is too close to the city of Dar
Es Salaam and other urban centers which are expanding every day.
</P>
<P>
These towns, he said, are polluting the environment and
bringing about an increasing demand for the forest products such
as charcoal, fuel-wood, timber and poles for building.
</P>
<P>
Other problems include the encroachment of forest in search of
more farming areas and building sites, poaching, mining of
kaolin, indiscriminate disposal of industrial wastes,
construction of television stations and communication facilities,
Secha added.

<P>
SHANGHAI, January 30 (Xinhua) -- More and more Shanghai and
Beijing citizens are planning to go abroad for holidays.
</P>
<P>
According to Shanghai Tourism Administrative Committee, about
5,000 citizens will be on overseas tours for the Spring Festival
holiday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the people selected Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia
followed by Hong Kong and Macao, an official of the board said.
</P>
<P>
At the business hall of the Shanghai Branch of China Youth
Travel Service, a retired woman named Ma said that she was very
glad for her tour to Thailand. Ma and her sister booked their
tickets in December.
</P>
<P>
One manager of travel services said the applicants for overseas
tours during the Spring Festival mostly were ordinary wage
earners.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, many citizens went to the Exit and Entry
Administration Office of the Beijing Public Security Bureau to get
application forms for overseas tours during the Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
An official of the department said that on average, the boom
for application forms starts in December and the number of
applicants reaches 3,000 a day.

<HEADLINE> EU Proposes Higher Compensation by Airlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Passengers bumped off
overbooked flights may soon receive more compensation from the
airlines where they booked their travel plans, the European
Commission announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which needs to be ratified by the council of
European Union transport ministers as an amendment to existing EU
legislation, is aimed at strengthening the rights of airline
travelers.
</P>
<P>
The maximum amount of compensation to be paid to passengers who
are bumped off scheduled and non-scheduled flight -- including
chartered flights -- because of overbooking will increase from 150
ECU to 185 ECU for flights of up to 3,500 kilometers, and from 300
ECU to 370 ECU for flights of more than 3,500 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The money will be payable immediately at the check-in desk for
any flight with any airline so long as the starting point is
located in an EU member state, a commission spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
The airlines are also obliged to help re-route the bumped
passengers.
</P>
<P>
EU legislation protecting passengers from overbooking was
passed in 1991. The proposed revision strengthens the obligation
of the airlines to inform customers of their rights and clarifies
the law regarding passengers holding travel vouchers rather than
tickets.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation union, made
the proposal amid rising concern that there are many cases in
which passengers were not, or not fully, compensated.
</P>
<P>
Many passengers are still unaware of their right to immediate
compensation and some flights fail to provide this information.
</P>
<P>
Neil Kinnock, European Commissioner in charge of
transportation, said: "This decision not only increases the amount
of money available, but ensures that airlines recognize their
obligations to the flying public.
</P>
<P>
"If you are a victim of overbooking, you have an automatic
right to compensation."

<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, January 30 (Xinhua) -- A brother and sister from
Huhhot, the capital of China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region,
who are members of the Mongolian nationality, have gotten their
education in Mongolian, their native language.
</P>
<P>
Narisa, who is majoring in telecommunications at Beijing Posts
and Telecommunications University, ranked first among all
Mongolian science students in the college entrance exam in 1995
and was one of the top Beijing college students taking the
national English Proficiency Test this year. Her brother Burgud,
who is at Beijing Medical Sciences University, will graduate this
summer and plans to continue with postgraduate studies, was in the
second place among all Mongolian science students in the college
entrance exam in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Qinghua University in Beijing, one of China's best, was deeply
impressed by Narisa's outstanding performance and regretted her
choice of Beijing Posts and Telecommunications University.
</P>
<P>
"It is not strange to see Mongolian students perform well at
school," said Bai Shuangshan, who is in charge of ethnic
minorities education at the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
education committee. "Even schools in remote pastoral areas are
sending students to college," he added, and attributes their
success to government's ethnic minority policies.
</P>
<P>
Education of the Mongolian people got no attention until 1947
when Inner Mongolia was set up as China's first ethnic minority
autonomous region, Bai explains. There were many temples instead
of schools, and crowds of lamas instead of students, on the inner
Mongolian prairie.
</P>
<P>
There were only 2,300 students at four ethnic middle schools
and 377 ethnic primary schools when the autonomous region was
established, he said, but there were 772,000 students in 1996, and
the region has 3,385 ethnic minority primary and middle schools in
rural areas and cities.

Higher education has developed rapidly and Mongolian students
or those from other ethnic backgrounds can get an education in
their own language and can choose from more than 30 majors at 12
colleges and universities in the region that provide a Mongolian
background.
</P>
<P>
There are 16.25 college students for every 10,000 people on
average in China, but 22.2 among the Mongolians. Burgud and
Narisa's father, Aqilatu, is an associate professor at Inner
Mongolia University who got his two children to learn Mongolian
before they went to college.
</P>
<P>
"My children now can speak both Mongolian and standard
Chinese. They are good at English, too," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region has policies giving
priority to ethnic minorities education and has Mongolian schools
in farming and pastoral areas. Bilingual schools were set up in
towns and cities. And the Inner Mongolia Education Publishing
House was established to compile and translate textbooks in the
Mongolian language for schools of various kinds.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Urges Negotiations to End U.S.-Iraq Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Friday urged the
United States and Iraq to resolve the crisis over Baghdad's
refusal to allow U.N. weapons inspectors into the country through
negotiations and not through military action.
</P>
<P>
The best way to resolve the crisis is still through
negotiations, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said
Friday at his Hari Raya (the festival to end a month-long fast for
Muslims) open house at his official residence here when asked to
comment on the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Washington warned that it would take military action against
Baghdad if the latter disallows the inspection of dangerous
weapons to continue.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian prime minister also welcomed Russia's move to
bring the United States and Iraq to the conference table in an
effort to diffuse the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that if the United States proceeds with its plan
to take military action against Iraq, many innocent lives would be
lost.
</P>
<P>
"If Iraq is bombed, it is unlikely that innocent people will
not be killed. It is impossible for others not to be hit, even how
accurate the target was. They cannot release the bomb exactly on
target. Usually others also will become victims," he said.

<HEADLINE> Levy Conditions His Return to Coalition Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Former Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy said Friday he would consider returning to the
coalition government if the government changes its political and
economic policy, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Levy as saying that Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu needs to take concrete steps to solve the country's
social problems and to promote the Middle East Peace Process.
</P>
<P>
Levy, who resigned from the Netanyahu government early this
month, noted that the coalition government should not indulge in
the cabinet infighting.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the reasons of his resignation, Levy criticized
the government for ignoring the commitments to allocate about 100
million U.S. dollars as special funds to solve problems of
development towns and disadvantaged neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
He also blamed that the government was short of positive
intention of moving the Middle East peace process and drawing a
viable plan on the second redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Levy-led Gesher party said there are no ongoing
contacts with the ruling Likud coalition about the possibility of
Levy's rejoining the government.
</P>
<P>
Gesher officials said that "the ball is in the prime minister's
court." They indicated they would not speculate on the likelihood
of Levy's return, saying "all options are open."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu expressed deep regrets at Levy's resignation, as the
departure of the five-member Gesher party left the coalition
government a slim majority of 61 in the 120-seat Knesset
(parliament).
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu also noted that he was confident that despite
Levy's resignation his coalition government will continue leading
the country.
</P>
<P>
"I believe this coalition will continue, its work will
continue, and its existence will continue to do what it has to do
until 2000," Netanyahu had said.

<HEADLINE> Wild Elephants Well Protected in Xishuangbanna (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- By the side of the Sancha River
in Xishuangbanna in Yunnan Province, wild elephants frequently
would wander out of the forests to play and look for food,
ignoring villagers working or gathering there.
</P>
<P>
The elephants are now free to roam on the mountain slopes,
along the river and in the forests. They even have walks on
highways and motor vehicles have to wait until they leave the
roads.
</P>
<P>
Sa Piao, a young man of Hani ethnic group, said that elephants
in Xishuangbanna are becoming bolder and bolder, and that they
seem to know that people are their friends and will not harm them.
</P>
<P>
Wild elephants are on the top of the protected list in
Xishuangbanna, a prefecture of Yunnan Province with one million
hectares of tropical rainforest in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
With the shrinkage of forests, wild elephants have been
decreasing.
</P>
<P>
To protect the wild elephants and other animals, Yunnan
Province designated 240,000 hectares of forests as a nature
reserve.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhanqiang, deputy director of the Administration of
Xishuangbanna Natural Reserve, said that 14 years ago there were
only 197 wild elephants in the rainforests. Last year, the number
of elephants increased to 250.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, it is not easy for ethnic minority people living in
and around the natural reserve to befriend the elephants.

Wang said the elephants often walk through the fields, spoiling
crops at harvest time, and can be troublesome to the 114 nearby
villages.
</P>
<P>
Yan Hanlong, a villager near the reserve, said that through
the government's campaigns to protect the wild animals, people
have become aware of the importance of protecting elephants.
</P>
<P>
"Whenever the elephants entered our fields, we just shouted at
them or beat gongs to warn them," Yan said.
</P>
<P>
"At the beginning, the elephants would leave the fields and
return to the forests, but after a while the elephants ignored our
warnings."
</P>
<P>
To make up the losses caused by the elephants, the government
has allocated special funds to compensate the farmers. Meanwhile,
the government also issued regulations on the protection of wild
animals.
</P>
<P>
Yan said: "The measures of the government led us to be friends
with the elephants. People will not harm the elephants even when
they are spoiling their fields."
</P>
<P>
With the increasing number of elephants in Xishuangbanna, more
overseas and domestic tourists are visiting the Sancha River
Forest Park where there are cable cars and forest hotels for
viewing elephants.

<HEADLINE> Green "Great Walls" Help Work Magic in Desert Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Despite a record drought last
summer in Yuyang County in northwest China's Shaanxi Province,
farmer Yan Zizhong still managed to get a harvest.
</P>
<P>
A grain field with a per-hectare output of more than 16,500
kilograms may be nothing to boast about in southern or eastern
China, but for a farmer in the desert such as Yan it is magical.
</P>
<P>
"You can see the unthinkable difference, for I could only reap
8,000 kilograms of grain per hectare by the end of the '80s," Yan
said. His county is located in the Yulin area in the northern part
of Shaanxi, which is dominated by continuous deserts with little
rain and fierce winds.
</P>
<P>
In the four desert counties of Yulin, Jingbian, Dingbian and
Shenmu, there are many farmers like Yan who have benefited from an
afforestation project.
</P>
<P>
Four green "great walls" 2,500 kilometers long have been built
in the 24,000 square kilometers of deserts to protect grain fields.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in the above-mentioned four counties,
grain fields with outputs of 16,500 kilograms or more per hectare
have expanded to 13,000 hectares since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Yan said that when he began multiple crop planting in the
desert a few years ago, even he thought it was an unrealizable
dream. But the dream came true with more attention to the
environment, expansion of agricultural techniques and reasonable
use of light, heat and water.
</P>
<P>
Such magic is now extending deep into the deserts, which has
also brightened the future of agriculture in other parts of
northwestern China.

<HEADLINE> Property Rights Transfers Gain Popularity in China  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Yang Jingtao and five other
farmers recently purchased six township enterprises in Pingyi
County, Shandong Province, for 1.48 million yuan and then
restructured them.
</P>
<P>
This is just one case of property rights transfers which are
becoming increasingly popular as China moves rapidly toward a
market economy.
</P>
<P>
Economists say that China has entered a period of active trading
in property rights, with forms including mergers, takeovers,
purchases, auctions and buying shares.
</P>
<P>
Since China launched its reform and opening-up drive in the
late 1970s, associations between enterprises have reached an
unprecedented level. Many small, inefficient enterprises have
merged or been purchased.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese authorities have, at the same time, approved the
sale of property rights of some small state-owned
enterprises. Many joint-stock companies have issued shares and
property rights warrants, selling them through public offerings or
off-floor trading.
</P>
<P>
The 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
officially endorsed the formation of large enterprise groups
across regions, sectors and ownerships, providing a new impetus
for the transfer of property rights among different enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese cities have chosen information releases to
facilitate property rights transfers. Late last year the special
economic zone of Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, announced the
transfer of six enterprises while the northern Chinese city of
Shenyang held a press conference for the change of property
rights of 192 small enterprises.

<P>
On Nov. 25, 56 enterprises with total assets valued at more
than 600 million yuan were offered for sale at the first property
rights transfer fair in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
In Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, 26 small-
and medium-sized enterprises were offered for sale, lease or
contract.
</P>
<P>
However, many property rights transfers have gone
unnoticed. Private enterprises in southwest China's Chongqing
Municipality had purchased and merged 161 state-owned and
collective enterprises by the end of October, double the figure
for the same 1996 period.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, China's largest financial and economic city, 300
enterprises were traded on the Shanghai Property Rights Exchange
in the first half of 1997, with turnover topping 5.3 billion yuan,
which was five times the comparable figure for 1996.
</P>
<P>
China's first institution specializing in property rights
trading was founded in 1988. Currently, the number of such
institutions exceeds 190.
</P>
<P>
China has decided to let its enterprises sink or swim in the
marketplace. An official of the Henan Provincial Commission for
Restructuring the Economy said that the central Chinese province
will offer several thousands of small- and medium-size enterprises
for sale, auction and transformation into shareholding companies
in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zhuhai will reduce its number of state-owned and
collective enterprises, now at 20,000, by 50 percent in three
years.
</P>
<P>
As more market-oriented reform measures are unveiled, property
rights trading will become more active and frequent in China,
economists predict.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Hold Constitutional Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- A historic constitutional
convention, aimed at debating whether Australia should be a
republic or keep the current political system by 152 delegates,
will be held in the capital Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard is going to open the two-week
convention, which is to be attended by the 152 delegates, half of
them appointed by the government and the rest elected throughout
the country, and take place in the old parliament house.
</P>
<P>
The delegates will vote on three issues: Should Australia
become a republic, what form that republic should take and a time
frame for any change.
</P>
<P>
If a consensus is reached, Howard has promised to take the
question directly to the people in a referendum.
</P>
<P>
However, the delegates to the convention Friday were encouraged
to expand deliberations beyond the republic issue.
</P>
<P>
A women's constitutional summit this week called on convention
delegates to look at other constitutional issues, particularly a
Bill of Rights and a constitutional preamble which recognize
indigenous Australians.
</P>
<P>
A majority of the more than 300 women delegates to the two-day
summit agreed that Australia should become a republic as long as a
number of principles are upheld.
</P>
<P>
"The recognition and acceptance of indigenous Australians and
that gender equity must be part of all processes of change we
might go through," convention organizer Christina Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
There was also a general consensus that a Bill of Rights should
be enshrined, she said.
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it, 152 people as a test of their personal
credibility have to deliver an outcome from those two weeks of
debate or the nation will be screaming," she said.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leader Kim Beazley said he also hoped the convention
would produce a clear proposition to take to the Australian
people.

<HEADLINE> Butler Plays Down Blunt Remarks on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Amid mounting protests over his
aggressive remarks on Iraq, chief United Nations aims inspector
Richard Butler said here Friday that he was misinterpreted by a New
York Times report which quoted him as saying that Iraq had enough
biological warheads to "wipe out" Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference after a meeting with German
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, Butler said that the interview with
him published by the New York Times on Tuesday did not accurately
reflect what he meant to say.
</P>
<P>
"What is really an issue is the number of Iraqi special warheads
that remain to be accounted for," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Unless we can get an account of these special warheads which
were filled with biological and chemical contents, it is always
theoretically possible that they could pose a threat to all kinds
of places around Iraq. That all my remarks were meant to
illustrate," Butler said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the New York Times Friday published a
correction and a letter from him to make clear the issue.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the news conference, Kinkel reiterated that
Germany cannot categorically rule out the possibility of military
strike against Iraq given that diplomatic efforts failed to make
Iraq comply with the UN demands for arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
But he also stressed it was necessary first of all to try all
political and diplomatic possibilities to avoid an further
escalation of the situation in Iraq.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Arab and foreign diplomats,
accompanied by Iraqi Deputy Premier Tariq Aziz, visited a
presidential site Thursday, according to diplomatic sources here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The site is situated in the Tharthar area, some 100 kilometers
north west of Baghdad, the sources said. The visit organized by
the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The sources pointed out that similar tours would be organized
for the diplomats over the coming two days of Ramadan Bairam
(Islamic feast that follows the fasting month of Ramadan) to see
for themselves the nature of the presidential palaces.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of
eliminating Iraqi weapons of mass destruction suspected Iraq is
still concealing secretive weapons programs in dozens of
presidential palaces and sovereignty sites.
</P>
<P>
The commission has been asking for unrestricted access to those
sites and U.S. and Britain have threatened military actions to
force Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has rejected the UNSCOM demand but proposed to invite
representatives and diplomats from U.N. Security Council members
to visit those sites instead.
</P>
<P>
A large group of Arab and foreign correspondents had toured
some Iraqi presidential palaces last December at the invitation of
Aziz.

<P>
TOKYO, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto on Friday named former trade minister Hikaru Matsunaga
as finance minister, top government spokesman Kanezo Muraoka
announced.
</P>
<P>
Matsunaga, chairman of the House of Representatives Budget
Committee, will succeed Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, who resigned Wednesday
to take responsibilities for a scandal involving two inspectors of
the Finance Ministry. The two inspectors were arrested on charges
of taking bribes from banks.
</P>
<P>
Muraoka, chief cabinet secretary, quoted Hashimoto as saying
that he hopes Matsunaga will undertake a drastic reform of the
corruption-tainted finance ministry as he was once a prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Matsunaga, 69, vowed to do his
utmost to enforce official discipline and recover public trust in
the ministry, which he said "was seriously impaired" due to the
bribery scandal.
</P>
<P>
"I think it most important to regain public trust by taking
this chance to enforce discipline, and take strict action if
anything is wrong and anyone who has done wrong is found," he said.
</P>
<P>
Matsunaga told reporters that he recognize "the economy is now
in a very serious situation."
</P>
<P>
He said he will maintain the government's current position of
taking necessary steps to stimulate the economy within the limits
of fiscal restraint.

<HEADLINE> Northeastern Chinese Province Making Industry More Competitive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's old
industrial base, Jilin Province will reorganize assets and adjust
the structure of its industries to make them more competitive,
according to a senior official.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Dejiang, secretary of the Jilin Provincial Committee of
the Communist Party of China, says the move is for fast and
healthy development.
</P>
<P>
Under the planned economy, Jilin had an advantage in the
automobile and chemical sectors with a group of enterprises that
led the country in their fields.
</P>
<P>
But, it began losing its advantage as the market economy
developed and quite a number of enterprises ended up in difficulty
and lost money.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Dejiang says he believes that the re-structuring will
help solve some of the deep-rooted problems. First, they will
change the product mix, assets, and organization of the First
Automobile Works (FAW) Group and the Jilin Chemical Industrial
Group, which produce a quarter of of the province's annual
industrial output, to make them competitive and more profitable.
</P>
<P>
The FAW Group will increase production of small cars and will
be encouraged to establish spare parts and special-purpose motor
vehicle groups in cooperation with local enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The Jilin Chemical Industrial Group will work with other
enterprises to set up large enterprise groups and increase fund
raising and change its product mix, focusing on ethylene products.
</P>
<P>
The re-structuring effort will also focus on groups in
medicine, food, electronics, farm produce and animal husbandry
processing, and timber.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to establish a group of conglomerates with
sales of more than one billion yuan each within five years and help
develop high-tech and high added-value products.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Junta to Grant Amnesty to Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's military ruler
Lt. Colonel Johnny Paul Koroma announced Thursday evening that
his administration "has decided to grant amnesty to all students
involved in student demonstrations" against his regime in last
August.
</P>
<P>
Koroma made the announcement in a nationwide radio and
television broadcast to mark the end of Ramadan fasting. He
attributed the "clemency as a gesture of goodwill in the true
spirit of reconciliation."
</P>
<P>
"All students can now return to their campuses for effective
educational activities", he said, adding that "the government is
working on modalities in meeting the basic facilities and grants
of all tertiary institutions for normal activities to be
restored."
</P>
<P>
Students leaders in Freetown, however, have turned down the
offer saying, "we have done nothing wrong and therefore see no
reason for the so-called amnesty."
</P>
<P>
"We demonstrated because we are for democracy and want a
return to civilian rule," said one student leader.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Koroma also appealed to the Kamajor militiamen
"to lay down their arms, cease all hostilities and join the rest
of the population in consolidating peace."
</P>
<P>
Local reports said the upsurge in blocking virtually all
strategic highways leading to major towns in the interior would
make it unlikely for the combatants to heed Koroma's appeal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a local authoritative weekly the Point newspaper
said a seven-man delegation, including five parliamentarians and
two cabinet ministers in the ousted civilian regime of Tejan
Kabbah arrived at the Lungi International Airport, across the
Sierra Leone estuary on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Their mission cannot be unconnected with recent reports that
the proscribed parliament intends to resume sittings on Sierra
Leone soil in preparation of April 22 when the junta is expected
to hand over power to the civilian government," said the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"The delegation will be inspecting facilities available for
accommodation of the majority of government functionaries who are
now tired with life in Guinea," it added.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, there were jubilations when the news
about the arrival of parliamentarians spread in the Aafu Bullom
Chiefdom.

<HEADLINE> Ningxia Moslems Celebrate Lesser Bairam Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Some 1.76 million Muslims in
northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region gathered today in
2,700 mosques to celebrate the traditional Lesser Bairam, or
fast-ending festival.
</P>
<P>
Muslims, in white caps and holiday clothing, exchanged
greetings with each other. Local leaders went to mosques or Muslim
households to convey festival greetings to the Muslim residents.
</P>
<P>
This Muslim holiday, combined with the Spring Festival which
fell on Jan. 28, added to the holiday atmosphere in the
region. One-sixth of China's Muslims live in the region.
</P>
<P>
Besides the seven-day Spring Festival vacation, Muslim
officials can take one more day off than Han inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
Local people from different nationalities hosted various
celebrations for this "festival within a festival."
</P>
<P>
Ningxia is called "the Chinese Islamic Region." Of its
population of 5.6 million, some 33.8 percent are Muslims.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to the policy of regional autonomy for minority
nationalities, our religious beliefs and customs are fully
respected," said Xie Shenglin, vice-president of the China Islamic
Association. "Now the region has 2,700-odd mosques and more than
10,000 Imams and other religious staff in the mosques."
</P>
<P>
The lives of local Muslims also have undergone profound
changes. "Four decades ago we could hardly feed ourselves. Some
locals even had to beg for food in the Lesser Bairam," said
82-year-old Liu Yulan in Shuangqukou Village of Yinchuan, capital
of the region. "Now we don't have to worry about feeding and
clothing ourselves. All people in the villages even raised funds
to build a mosque. For villagers of my age, it is a dream that has
come true."
</P>
<P>
"The per-capita income in our village in 1958 was merely 72
yuan," said Yan Bao, the village head. "That figure increased to
more than 3,000 yuan last year and our village has become the
first 'well-to-do' one in the region," he added.

<HEADLINE> Four Cambodian Parliamentarians Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 30 (Xinhua) -- A group of four self-exiled
Cambodian parliamentarians returned home Friday.
</P>
<P>
The four had been outside the country since a factional
fighting in early July 1997 between troops backing co-Prime
Minister Hun Sen and those loyal to Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
Two of the returnees are from the National United Front for an
Independent, Neutral, Peaceful and Unificative Cambodia
(FUNCINPEC) and the other two are from the Buddhist Liberal
Democratic Party (BLDP).
</P>
<P>
Upon its arrival, the group released a declaration appealing
for immediate ceasefire and the cessation of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
Returnee Son Son Ber, of BLDP, also second vice-chairman of the
National Assembly, told reporters at the airport, "As one of the
members of the parliament, I have to return and work with other
members of the assembly in order to help preparation for the
forthcoming elections."
</P>
<P>
It was the first group of law makers to return home. During and
after the July fighting, 21 law makers fled the country, and most
of them had been staying in Bangkok, Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Over $3.3 Billion Invested in Mozambique Since </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Statistics from the Mozambican
Investment Promotion Center (CPI) showed that over 3.3 billion
U.S. Dollars had been invested in 910 projects in Mozambique
since 1985.
</P>
<P>
The Noticias Friday quoted the statistics as saying that
Maputo city and province in southern Mozambique has drawn 2.3
billion dollars for investment in 534 projects, which accounts
for 59 percent of the total amount, far exceeding the investment
in the rest nine province put together.
</P>
<P>
Sofala province in central Mozambique was the second in the
list, attracting 358 million Dollars for 83 projects.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Niassa province in the northern part of the country
has the least investment, with only 7.17 million Dollars for 12
projects.
</P>
<P>
The imbalance of investment in regions around the country has
resulted in many problems such as job opportunities and other
welfare, making capital Maputo over-crowded with people seeking
for better job opportunities, according to the CPI, which urged
the government to take up measures to solve the issue.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Sri Lankan Government Makes Gains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The first local government
elections in more than a decade in northern Sri Lanka concluded
Thursday night and the Sri Lankan government seems to be a key
winner apart from those contesting political parties.
</P>
<P>
Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera described the election as "a
step to the right direction" at Friday's cabinet news briefing.
</P>
<P>
He said the northern people made a major step toward restoring
democracy and normalcy in their homeland when they cast ballots
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Eelam People's Democratic Party (EPDP) turned out to be the
biggest winner as it secured 105 out of the 232 seats for 17 local
government bodies in Jaffna District and part of Kilinochchi
District.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) won the Jaffna
Municipal Council, the most important one among the 17 although it
was only contesting for two local bodies. The remaining seats are
shared by three other Tamil parties and one independent group.
</P>
<P>
Political critics here said however that only the Sri Lankan
government has emerged the real winner in this "political game," a
phrase they use to describe the polls.
</P>
<P>
The government won because, on the one hand, it had succeeded
in organizing the elections, they noted.
</P>
<P>
When the government's decision to hold elections in the north
was announced last December, it was met with strong opposition
from the Tamil parties. Many Tamil politicians, along with the
main opposition, the United National Party (UNP), expressed their
reservations.
</P>
<P>
They argued that the ground situation was not conducive to
holding elections because the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) is still active in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there are many practical issues, such as power
supply, education and transport, that should be solved first.
Moreover, not many registered voters were present in Jaffna City
and other electorates.
</P>
<P>
However, the government ignored the objections both from Tamil
parties and the main opposition and decided to go ahead with the
elections.
</P>
<P>
Plans and timetables were announced. As a result, those Tamil
parties softened their positions and decided to run in the polls.
</P>
<P>
Five political parties and two independent groups became major
players in the contest. Their participation and the smoothly
implemented campaigns were regarded by the government as a
necessary step to revive civilian administration in the north,
which has been absent due to the country's ethnic war.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the government took advantage of the
elections to divert public criticism of the shortcomings and
faults of the security forces.
</P>
<P>
Government officials, security forces and voters were almost
sure the LTTE would carry out armed attacks to disrupt the
elections, especially at a time when its bomb attack on Kandy's
Dalada Maligawa (Tooth Relic Temple) last Sunday was strongly
condemned by people from all walks of life in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
During the campaigning process prior to the polls, Tamil rebels
urged some candidates and voters to stay away from the polls and
in an attack last week, they killed two EPDP candidates.
</P>
<P>
Providing adequate and efficient security to voters and
candidates seemed to gain importance and urgency after the
opposition and the general public censured the military for their
serious security lapse, which was partially responsible for the
bomb attack in the ancient capital city of Kandy.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, voters cast their ballots amid tight security and
no major incident of violence was reported except a pre-dawn
exchange of fire between government troops and Tamil rebels.
The successful conduct of the security measures during the polls
gave great relief to the government and military, which could not
afford to err again.
</P>
<P>
Certainly the elections have greater significance for the
government. Local analysts say the reconstruction work in Jaffna
Peninsula would gain momentum soon after the elections of local
governments. Earlier, slow rehabilitation work often drew
criticism from the public.
</P>
<P>
However, though the government has successfully held the
elections, much leaves to be done to bring normalcy back to the
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil Tigers are still a major threat to the local people
while government military presence in the north could not be
reduced overnight. And most infrastructure facilities need to be
repaired or upgraded.
</P>
<P>
Also, a turnout rate of as low as 18.6 percent in the election
indicated the local people's deep-rooted fear of the rebels.
Unless the military establish their dominance in the battlefields
and drive the rebels out of their northern jungles, the desired
normalcy could not be achieved soon.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Expert Keen on Preventing Desertification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Qi Jianzhong, a 62-year-old
Chinese desertification expert has spent nearly four decades in
the field in China's Shaanxi Province, since he graduated from
university.
</P>
<P>
He has seen sand dunes turn green while his hair turned white,
and a scar on his wife's eyelid attests to his devotion and
difficulties. It is the reminder of one of his battles to save
newly planted seeds, when he received a telegraph telling him that
his wife, off in another province, had had a serious eye
accident. He put the telegram in a drawer and went on trying to
save the seeded ground.
</P>
<P>
"I have been devoted to this cause," he says, "If we stop, the
wilderness and poverty will return."
</P>
<P>
Qi has felt this way ever since he first saw the number of
people suffering from malnutrition because of adverse conditions
in the desert and decided that he would use his knowledge to help
change this.
</P>
<P>
So, he focused his efforts on aerial seeding, which is somewhat
workable in large deserts. For research, he explains, deserts are
the best laboratories.
</P>
<P>
Choosing the proper plant species was the key, so he tried
simulated seeding with different plants, carrying a 50-kg sack of
seeds and spreading it across sand dunes.
</P>
<P>
Eventually, his efforts paid off, turning 400,000 ha of desert
into green-belts and similar results elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Qi has had 25 desertification research projects, some with
internationally recognition, and he is leading a group working on
another seven projects. "Scientific research combined with
practice is my favorite pastime," he concludes.

<HEADLINE> Swedish Ericsson Reports Record Profit for 1997 </HEADLINE>

<P>
STOCKHOLM, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Swedish telecommunications
firm Ericsson reported on Thursday a pre-tax profit for 1997 of
17.2 billion Swedish kronor (2.27 billion U.S. dollars), an
increase of 70 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
This was not only a record-large profit for Ericsson, but the
largest annual profit ever earned by a Swedish firm.
</P>
<P>
As has been the case for years, the success was mainly a result
of a very strong development in mobile phones. Ericsson's net
sales of mobile phones climbed by 87 percent during the year.
According to CEO Lars Ramquist, Ericsson has taken a larger slice
of this lucrative world market.
</P>
<P>
The Ericsson board of directors has unexpectedly decided to
appoint Sven-Christer Nilsson, 53, new president and CEO of
Ericsson, succeeding Lars Ramqvist, whom the board proposed as new
chairman after Bjoern Svedberg.
</P>
<P>
Nilsson has worked within Ericsson since 1982, and is at
present head of Business Unit Cellular Systems - America Standards
within Business Area Mobile Systems.

<HEADLINE> IOC Recognizes Four More Sports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Four more sports were recognized
by the International Olympic Committee as the world sports body
gave provisional recognition to the four international federations
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sumo wrestling, body building, speed boating and motorcycling
have joined the list of sports recognized by the IOC executive
board, the first step toward possible acceptance as Olympic sports.
</P>
<P>
Body building was recognized despite its record and reputation
for use of steroids and other banned drugs as IOC director general
Francois Carrard said that the abuses of drugs were caused by
outside elements and not caused by the federation.
</P>
<P>
Recognition of the four federations is valid for a two-year
trial period. After that, full recognition can be granted by the
IOC. Then, the sport becomes eligible for Olympic status.
</P>
<P>
"The policy of the IOC is to open the doors to all sports
organizations under an Olympic umbrella," Carrard said.
</P>
<P>
However, recognition doesn't necessarily mean they will go on
the Olympic program. There are more than two dozen IOC-recognized
federations which are not in the Olympics, including golf,
bowling, ballroom dancing, rugby and squash.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Overseas Investments Expected to Plunge in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 30 (Xinhua) -- South Korea companies' overseas
direct investments are expected to drop sharply in 1998, the
Korean Trade-Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the body's "World Foreign Direct Investment Report '98,"
the grant of IMF emergency loans to Korea will prevent local firms
from expanding their overseas investments for the time being.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said that local companies will have to
begin direct investment abroad for the long-term to maintain their
competitiveness in the world.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, once the 11th largest economy in the world, has
been in a serious crisis triggered by the collapse of
conglomerates and bad loans of financial institutions since late
1997.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predicted that the economic crisis will deepen this
yeas as the country, under an agreement signed with the
International Monetary Fund for a bailout loan of 57 billion
U.S. dollars, has to completely open its financial market and
restructure its ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
In the meanwhile, the country has to pay a total of 10.4
billion U.S. dollars in interest for its foreign debts of 153
billion U.S. dollars before next January.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said South Korea's economy could grind to a halt
without speedy assistance from international organizations and
western industrialized countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government
Internet home page recorded a nine-fold increase in the number of
visitors over the past two years, the Government Information
Services said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Monthly visitor traffic to the index page of the Government
Information Center surged from 14,000 in December 1995 when the
wet site was launched, to 121,000 in December 1997. The average
number of visitors per day jumped from about 520 to 3,930 during
the two-year period, when a total of 1.5 million users were
recorded.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Information Services Department said Friday
that the web site was a single access point for home pages of all
policy bureaux and government departments.
</P>
<P>
He said that all bureaux and departments had uploaded their
home pages onto the Internet by the end of last year. "Information
about the services, work and organization of the government
agencies are freely available at the users' fingertips," he said.
</P>
<P>
Information available ranges from policy documents and
consultation papers to current weather and daily cause lists at
local courts, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
He was confident that Internet would become an important
communication means between the government and the public as more
and more people were aware of its advantage. "It can transmit
voluminous but neatly presented information in the shortest
possible time, reaching every corner of the world provided with a
computer," said the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Manila Accuses Rebels of Violating Cease-fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government army
Friday accused Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rebels of
violating a cease-fire agreement, saying the rebels fired mortar
rounds at a government army detachment in Maguindanao, Mindanao,
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Philippine News Agency quoted government army
sources as reporting that the MILF rebels fired 39 rounds of 81-mm
mortar at the army's Sultan Base Detachment in Upper Minabay,
Buldon, Maguindanao, at 12:45.
</P>
<P>
The government force retaliated by shelling the MILF position
with mortar and 105-mm howitzer, it said.
</P>
<P>
While no casualty was reported on the government force side,
the casualties on the MILF side were undetermined, the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
During the past month, more than 20 government soldiers and
rebels have been killed in their fighting in the Maguindanao area.
The two sides accused each other of violating the cease-fire
agreement reached last July.
</P>
<P>
However, the government and the rebels promised to resume their
peace talks next week.
</P>
<P>
The MILF has become the major rebel force in the Philippines
after the Moro National Liberation Front signed an accord on peace
in Mindanao with the government in September 1996.
</P>
<P>
The MILF rejected the peace accord and is continuing its
fighting for an independent state in the southern Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Commission Concerned over Situation in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Joint Commission of the
Angolan Peace Process has expressed its concern over the military
situation in Angola as destabilizing factors remain in some areas
of the country.
</P>
<P>
After a plenum Thursday night, the joint commission disclosed
some incidents which have taken place in the recent past and have
made the military situation in Angola worrying.
</P>
<P>
According to the joint commission, the remaining forces of the
former rebel UNITA movement and some criminal gangs provoked and
launched attacks against local police stations and government
locations in northern and southern Angola, especially in Malanje
and Bie provinces, recently.
</P>
<P>
Some unidentified people have even attacked and occupied the
police headquarters in Chicuma, it added.
</P>
<P>
The joint commission has decided to send a joint investigation
team of U.N. observers, government officials and members of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to
look into the incidents.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that new land mines were found to have been
replanted in almost all the regions in Angola, particularly in
Bie Province and several people have been killed so far.

<P>
Meanwhile, the joint commission expressed its appreciation
over the positions by the Angolan government and the UNITA to
complete the peace process by the end of February.

It also welcomed the recent decision by the U.N. Security
Council to extend the term of the U.N. Observers' Mission based

<HEADLINE> Algeria Not to Use S. Africa-Made Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 30 (Xinhua) -- A senior Algerian
official has said here that his country will not use South
Africa-made remote controlled reconnaissance aircraft for
military purposes.
</P>
<P>
Algerian ambassador to South Africa Said Kitouni said Thursday
that the aircraft, which Algeria was buying from South Africa,
would be used to control his country's 8,000 km borders, shipping
lanes, oil pipelines, foreign investments in Algeria and even for
agricultural purposes such as monitoring locusts.
</P>
<P>
"We do not need this to fight with," Kitoni told a group of
South African and foreign journalists in a visit to a factory
where the remote controlled reconnaissance aircraft, Seeker, is
being built.
</P>
<P>
Denel, South Africa's arms manufacturer, announced earlier
that Algeria had ordered one Seeker unit at a total cost of 20
million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The unit includes four Seeker aircraft, control and support
facilities and training for Algerian operators. Delivery of the
system would take place within the next two years, Denel
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The arms deal has been confronted with criticism of some South
African organizations, which said the ongoing civil war in
Algeria had claimed tens of thousands of lives and Algerian
government troops might use South Africa-made aircraft to
suppress oppositions.

NEW DELHI, January 30 (Xinhua) -- India Friday commemorated
Mahatma Gandhi, father of India, on his 50th death anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Indian President K. R. Narayanan, Vice-President Krishan Kant
and Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral led the nation in paying
homage to Gandhi on his 50th death anniversary. They offered
flowers and stood in silence for a few seconds before his tomb in
memory of him.

Former presidents and prime ministers as well as other leaders
also offered floral tributes.
</P>
<P>
Gandhi was assassinated at a meeting in New Delhi, capital of
India, on January 30, 1948, one year after the country won
independence. During his lifetime, Gandhi led a protracted
non-violent struggle against British rule over India and forced
the British to give freedom and independence to the country in
1947. People in India respect Gandhi for his long and wise
leadership in their struggle for freedom and regard him as the
father of the nation.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 30 (Xinhua) -- South African motorists
will have their new driving licenses since March 1, local daily
"The Citizen" quoted the Department of Transport as reporting
Friday.
</P>
<P>
All motorists would have to get their new cards within five
years since then, or they would lose their driving licenses, the
department said.
</P>
<P>
The licenses to be issued would be in the new card format,
which replaces driver's licenses contained in ID books.
</P>
<P>
Motorists applying for the card would have to produce an ID
book containing a valid, original driver's license, pass an eye
test and be finger printed.
</P>
<P>
Data on driver's licenses would be stored on a National
Traffic Information System, instead of on the Population
Register, where it was inaccessible to traffic and transport
authorities, said the department sources said.
</P>
<P>
The new system is expected to reduce traffic management cost
through more efficient management and administration and diminish
the more than one million false licenses on the road. This would
lead to safer roads, the sources said.

<P>
CANBERRA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar finished
the week lower, dampened by a fall in the New Zealand dollar after
an international ratings agency downgraded its outlook for that
currency.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 67.01 U.S. cents from 67.26
late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
New York-based Moody's Investors Service Friday announced it

sovereign credit rating to negative from stable.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand currency shed half a U.S. cent on the news.
</P>
<P>
Moody's said the adjustment in the outlook "reflected concerns
that have surfaced recently regarding the widening of the
imbalance in the country's external accounts, as well as the
potential impact of the events now unfolding in Asia on the New
Zealand economy."
</P>

ANKARA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Tourism Minister
Ibrahim Gurdal said Friday that Turkey is sparing no efforts to
attract 12 million tourists to the country this year.
</P>
<P>
This will mean up to 10 billion U.S. dollars in tourism income
and a one-quarter increase from last year, according to the
semi-official Anatolia news agency.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Gurdal, who is spending Ramadan Festival in Uludag,

planning to increase the bed capacity for tourist industry to at
least 1 million from the current 600,000 in the whole country.
</P>
<P>
The minister revealed that in the run-up to the year 2000,
Turkey will carry out three projects in tourism: Anatolia-2000,
Silk Road Project and establishment of a 100,000-bed holiday city.
</P>
<P>
Turkey gained 7.5 billion U.S. dollars in tourism revenue in

CANBERRA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Ninth seed Marcelo Rios of
Chile will play sixth seed Petr Korda of Czech in the Australian
Open men's singles final on Sunday after disposing of Nicolas
Escude in straight sets in a semi-final in Melbourne on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Rios had little trouble in pushing aside Escude, who in
previous matches had shown exceptional fighting qualtiies. The
Chilean secured his final spot with victory of 6-1, 6-3, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Frenchman Escude had never found his usual rhythm and was
plunged into deep trouble from the outset. He didn't perform his
customary fightback which enabled him to win three of his minor
round matches from two sets down.
</P>
<P>
Rios will play for the title against Petr Korda as both are
shooting for their first Grand Slam title.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, world No.1 woman player Martina Hingis won her

<HEADLINE> SKorea to Raise Price of Internationa Air Freight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 30 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will raise the cost of
international air freight by 30 percent from Febraury 16 this year,
the first time since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Construction and Transportation Ministry announced Friday
that it had approved the raise after consultations with the
International Air Transport Association (IATA), and the Korea
International Trade Air Association.
</P>
<P>
The move gives Korean Air and Asiana Airlines the green light
to increase their cargo fares on all their international routes
from February 16.
</P>
<P>
The two airlines were seeking to have their prices of air cargo
increased 70 percent due to the sharp depreciation of South Korean
won resulting from the current financial crisis, but the ministry
just permitted a rise 30 percent to keep the air carriers
competitive on international routes.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has raised the prices of domestic air flights, buses
and subways in the past months while reducing or stopping
international flights because of the ongoing financial crisis caused
by the failure of conglomerates and bad loans of financial
institutions since late 1997, which saw the nation's per capita down
to 9,400 U.S. dollars from the 1996's 10,548 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that the year 1998 will witness a very hard
economic situation before the country.

<HEADLINE> Italy Voices Concern Over Possible Use of Force Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Italy is quite concerned with a
possible use of force in the weapons inspection impasse between
the United Nations and Iraq, said the foreign ministry on
Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
The use of force "would above all risk dividing the unity of
intent within the UN ambit that has thus far characterized the
management of the Iraqi crisis," said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Italy was following "with attention" the talks U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright and U.S. representative to the UN Bill
Richardson have been holding with the Security Council members and
countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Any new crisis would have grave consequences for the Iraqi
people and other countries in the region, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
It further pointed out that last November's back-from-the-brink
events had shown the efficiency of diplomatic efforts in resolving
even the tensest disputes.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini expressed the
hope that there would be no recourse of force against Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on statements made by U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright which did not rule out a U.S. intervention
against Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, Dini said, "I hope they don't
do it."

<HEADLINE> More Jewish Settlers Consider Staying Under </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The report quoted a telephone poll, which was carried out
early this week by Shvakim Panorama-Market Research and Polls
company, as saying that these was a marked increase over the
number of people who responded positively to the same type of
question in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
At that time, in a poll carried out by Bar-Ilan University's
BESA Center and the Nablus-based Center for Palestine Research and
Studies (CPRS), 16 percent of the respondents said they would
consider staying under Palestinian sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Forty-four percent of the respondents in the most recent
survey, in which four hundred Jewish households in the
settlements were polled, said they would take government
compensation to move back inside the Green Line (1949 armistice
line). Another 10 percent said they do not know what they would do.
</P>
<P>
The number of settlers who believe there will be a Palestinian
state also dropped since 1995, with some 20 percent saying that
there will eventually be a Palestinian state, while in the
BESA-CPRS poll some 39 percent believed there would be Palestinian
state in five to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
According to the Panorama poll, although 78 percent of the
settlers oppose a two-digit second redeployment of Israeli troops
in the West Bank, 66 percent are opposed to toppling the
government over the issue.
</P>
<P>
As to what should be done to prevent the second withdrawal, 3
percent settlers would use all means, including arms, and 9
percent would support civil disobedience.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-two percent said they would take part in rallies and
protests, while 26 percent said they would simply accept the
government's decision.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied the West Bank in the 1967 six-day war and
established military rule there. There are currently about
130,000 Jewish settlers living in the territories among 1.2
million Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli-Palestinian peace accords, both sides will
negotiate the fate of Jewish settlers in the final status talks
after the redeployment of Israeli troops.

BRUSSELS, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Dense fog coupled with

<P>
The collision took place Thursday in southwestern Belgium
close to the French border involving 40 vehicles.

The highway was closed for the whole day on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Gas Explosion Kills 77 in Northeastern Coal Mine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- A gas explosion killed 77
people and injured eight others in a state-owned coal mine in
northeast China's Liaoning Province recently, the ministries of
coal industry and labor jointly announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the accident, which happened on the evening of
Jan. 24 at the Wangjiaying Coal Mine under the Fuxin Coal Mining
Administration, is still under investigation, an official with the
Ministry of Coal Industry has said.
</P>
<P>
Chai Zhaoxi, director of the safety department under the coal
industry ministry, said the fire in the mine shaft resulted from
the explosion has been extinguished. Only one of the eight injured
miners remains in critical condition, Chai said.
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred in a new shaft that was not operational
yet when a large team of workers was installing equipment, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, it caused many more casualties than a usual
accident," Chai said. Normally only 30 miners work in a shaft at
one time, he noted.
</P>
<P>
An investigative team formed by officials from the ministries
of coal industry and labor, the All-China Federation of Trade
Unions and the provincial government of Liaoning Province went
into the shaft today to gather information about the accident.
</P>
<P>
"But they won't get a sure answer on the cause of the accident
until the water in the 300-meter long shaft is completely drained
away, which will take three to four days," Chai said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that shafts at the Wangjiaying mine have an average
depth of 400-to-500 meters, and that the coal bed there has a high
gas content. "Over 10 cubic meters of gas are released with every
ton of coal produced," he said.
</P>
<P>
With an annual coal production of more than 10 million tons,
Fuxin ranks among China's top 19 coal mines. The medium-size
Wangjiaying mine started operation in 1987 with a designed annual
production of 1.2 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Albright to Visit Israel, Palestine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright is due to pay a whirlwind visit to Israel and
Palestine from Saturday in which she will discuss with Israeli and
Palestinian leaders the Iraqi crisis and the peace process.
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli Foreign Ministry, Albright's visit will
last less than 24 hours and the arrangements for her stay were
made at the last minute without the authorized Israeli and
American teams certain about her next destination or the country
from which she will be coming from.
</P>
<P>
Albright is to arrive here Saturday evening and hold talks
with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shortly after her
arrival, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
After her meeting with Israeli President Ezer Weizman Sunday
morning, Albright will drive to Ramallah in the West Bank for
talks with Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser
Arafat, it said.
</P>
<P>
Before her departure Sunday afternoon, Albright is also to
have a talk with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, the
ministry added.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of an American military action against Iraq is
likely to be the main topic of discussions during her visit and
Albright would define Israel's "freedom of military action" in the
event the U.S. attacks Iraq, political observers here believed.
</P>
<P>
And her dominant talks with Arafat would be the need to call
off Arafat's support for Iraq if American military action against
Iraq was launched.
</P>
<P>
As for the peace process, there is virtually no chance for a
breakthrough on such chronic problems as the depth of Israel's
troop redeployment in the West Bank because her visit will be too
short.
</P>
<P>
After the Washington talks between netanyahu and U.S. President
Bill Clinton on January 20, a concept of partial and gradual
Israel's troop redeployment in the West Bank in exchange for PNA's
cracking down on terrorism was emerged. But Arafat has already
rejected such proposal.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-Iraqi conflict has had drawn attention of Israel.
During the last few days, Netanyahu has conferred with his key
cabinet ministers on this issue and its political effect on Israel
if the U.S. launches attack on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Foreign diplomats here said that by attacking Iraq, the
Americans will jeopardize their status as honest brokers in the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
If Israel joins the U.S. and Britain in an armed showdown, the
diplomtic impact would be to push Arabs into the sympathetic arms
of France and Russia while Israel be further pushed into
international isolation, they predicted.

<HEADLINE> 6 Ugandan Rebels' Camps Destroyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Uganda government troops and
their counterparts in Democratic Congo have destroyed six rebel
camps in the east of Congo, formerly Zaire, ''the New Vision''
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Colonel Charles Angina, the acting commander of the second
division of Ugandan army, said the destroyed camps were in
Ngingi, Rwandube, Kihutu and Busia off Mpondwe and Bwera border
posts in Kasese district, and Kikuka and Kamengo off Nyahuka
border posts in Bushenyi district of Uganda. All these camps are
located in Congo.
</P>
<P>
Two more camps -- Bukira and Buhira in the eastern Congo, may
be taken by the two armies at any time, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
These camps belong to the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a
rebel group acting in the west of Uganda. ADF had 1,500 soldiers
in its ranks in November 1996 before it left its bases in the
then Zaire to cross into Uganda. A recent report said it still
had hundreds of members. But Angina said the ADF has some 50
armed remnants at present.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a wife of the head of the Military
Intelligence Department of Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), had
surrendered to the government troops in northern district of
Lira.
</P>
<P>
LRA is a rebel group acting in the north.
</P>
<P>
Akello Milly, one of the three wives of Vincent Ottii, the
Intelligency Head of LRA, was abducted in April 1996. She had
given up to the army in the wake of a fierce fighting between the
rebel group and government troops in which 12 rebels have been
killed.
</P>
<P>
LRA had 2,000 men in its ranks in previous years but now it
has only hundreds of remnants under the intense attacks by
government troops.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Not to Revive Intifada: Israeli Sources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat is not interested in
disrupting the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and reviving
intifada (uprising), local newspaper The Jerusalem Post reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Israeli Army sources, who are involved in
analyzing the situation in Palestinian self-rule territories, as
saying that "he (Arafat) won't go to war in the territories, and
whoever is preparing plans for a war with the Palestinians is
mistaken."
</P>
<P>
The sources said the Palestinians will seek to maintain a
certain level of tension in the territories by heating things up
from time to time with disturbances, particularly in the West
Bank city of Hebron and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
But they added that such escalation will be kept to a level
that does not require the Israeli troops to intervene.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that Arafat has made a strategic decision
against further escalation, because the timing is not
right. Instead, he has chosen to wait for the expiry of the Oslo
Accords, upon which he will declare a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Arafat reiterated last month that PNA will declare statehood
in 1999 - if need be unilaterally - at the end of the five-year
interim period of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the sources said, Arafat aims to focus on
realizing parts of the accords, such as an airport at Dahaniya in
the Gaza Strip and a safe passage between Gaza and the West Bank,
and to have Israel implement large-size withdrawals from the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Arafat is pressuring the United States and
other countries to intervene by accusing Israel of blocking the
peace process. The sources said he has tried to evoke White House
recognition of Palestinian right to self-determination.
</P>
<P>
If Arafat does succeed, they noted, he intends to proceed with
it to the United Nations. Because he acknowledges that the U.S. is
the only party that can enable such a breakthrough, he is keeping
up as much pressure as possible on the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Arafat is also not interested in a terror
attack at the moment, for this would embarrass him in front of the
Americans. On the other hand, a senior Israeli defense source
said, Israeli troops are prepared for any eventuality.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda exported 10,118 tons of
tea in 1997, a 40 percent over the 7.195 tons in the previous
year, and it is expected to export 13,000 tons this year, the
Business Times reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tea prices averaged 0.25 Dollar per kg in January this year
from 0.13 Dollar in January 1997 in Rwanda, and that will boost
its foreign exchange earnings by over 90 percent, said the Kenyan
paper.
</P>
<P>
There are five tea processing factories in the tiny central
African country whose tea is exported via the auction in the
Kenyan port of Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda is reaping higher tea prices due to a shortage in
Kenya, a major producer in east Africa, following the heavy rains
that have hit tea production there.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan tea authorities have reacted by launching a major
program of rehabilitating plantations and factories to cash in on
its good fortune and its neighbor's misery.
</P>
<P>
Ran Bosco Eyadema, manager of the Rwanda Tea Board was quoted
as saying Kigali is firm to improve its tea output, saying, "we
are still operating in the range of 33 percent of our potential."
</P>
<P>
In 1992, Rwanda's tea exports hit a record high of 40,280
tons.

equipment and generators, are expected to increase along with

<HEADLINE> Ukraine, Turkmenistan Reach Agreement on Gas Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The agreement was reached on Friday between Turkmen President
Saparmurad Niyazov and his Ukrainian counterpart Leonid Kuchma,
who is paying a two-day state visit to Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
Turkmenistan is Ukraine's major natural gas provider besides
Russia. However, Turkmenistan cut off its natural gas supply to
Ukraine in March, 1997, due to Ukraine's delay in payment of 600
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Also the two presidents wrote a letter to Russian President
Boris Yeltsin, urging him to levy transit fees on Turkmenistan's
natural gas based on "the energy cooperation agreement within the
Commonwealth of Independent States(CIS)".
</P>
<P>
Niyazov expressed the hope that Russia will allow Turkmenistan
to cover the transit fees with natural gas, just like Ukraine does.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Bangladeshis Celebrate Eid-ul-Fitr </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is permeated in a
festive atmosphere on Friday, with people across the country
celebrating Eid-ul-Fitr, one of their major festivals.
</P>
<P>
In the capital city of Dhaka, the country's national flag is
hoisted atop public and private buildings, and the main
thoroughfares are dotted with miniature flags and festoons.
</P>
<P>
The city has become quiet, with most shops closed and few
people on the streets, and without the huge jams at ferry ghats,
railway stations and bus terminals as those during the past two
days.
</P>
<P>
One-third of the city's nearly 9 million residents have left
for their villages to observe Eid with their kith and kin, reports
said. And the remainder will mostly stay at home with their near
and dear ones.
</P>
<P>
To celebrate the festival, the Bangladeshi government has
announced a three-day holiday beginning Thursday for all employees
in the country, and has drawn up elaborate programs, such as
congregations, reunions, decorations of roads, and illuminations
of buildings.
</P>
<P>
President Shahabuddin Ahmed, felicitating the nation on the
occasion of the festival, said that Eid brings the message of
happiness to the rich and the poor like.
</P>
<P>
He urged people to forget all bitterness and ideological
conflicts on the auspicious day and forge a greater unity for the
interest of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina called on people to share their
joy with others. "The essence of Eid is to share the joy of the
festival equally with others," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Eid" in Arabic means "joy" and "Fitr" stands for "break of
fast". Eid-ul-Fitr, which comes after a month's ascetic practice
of fasting during Ramadan, is a "happy day", bringing people joy
and happiness.
</P>
<P>
For children, Eid is the day to wear new clothes, to collect
pocket money, and to do things they dare not do at any other time,
while for grown-ups, it is the time to go the mosque, to meet
friends and relatives, and treat themselves with a feast.

<HEADLINE> Serbian Prime Minister Vows to Stabilize Dinar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Serbian Prime Minister Mirko
Marjanovic promised Thursday to protect the dinar, the national
currency of Yugoslavia, and maintain the stability of prices.
</P>
<P>
The government and the national bank of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, as well as the government of Serbia would take
necessary measures, he stressed..
</P>
<P>
Marjanovic said this when on an inspection in Leskovac in
southern Serbia, the official Yugoslavian news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The gap between the official exchange rate of the dinar and
that on the black market has been widening since last December
with a sharp devaluation of the dinar on the black market.
</P>
<P>
Producers and sellers have been urged to raise prices. Some
economists and news media speculated that the official rate of the
dinar would also decline.
</P>
<P>
Marjanovic promised that all necessary measures would be taken
to protect the dinar from devaluation, which would result in
inflation as well as harming the economic policies and reforms.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister vowed that the government would strengthen
financial regulations to put an end to social disorder.
</P>
<P>
Marjanovic recalled the government's success in keeping the
inflation rate under 10 percent last year, while the industrial
and agricultural output enjoyed a record high in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The living standard rose 20 percent last year over 1996, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Marjanovic stressed that the government's economic policies
were supported by the people.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian government would uphold the strategy of stabilizing
the currency and prices so as to ensure a stable macro economy
as well as the development of the national economy, Marjanovic said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) rebels Friday bombed a military camp in Mindanao island,
the southern Philippines, a military report said.
</P>
<P>
The report said the rebels fired mortars and machine guns at
the government troops positioned Malibay, a village near a major
MILF lair in Buldon, Maguindanao province.
</P>
<P>
The troops were forced to retaliate with barrage of mortar
fires that inflicted heavy tolls on the MILF rebels, the report
said. No casualties on the government side were reported.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have clashed with each other near Buldon many
times since early last year. Although having signed a ceasefire
agreement with the government, the MILF recently launched a series
of attacks against government troops.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is currently the largest rebel group in the
Philippines. The government has been pursuing peace with it during
the past few years, but made little progress towards a final peace
agreement.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Outlook Rating Lowered to Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Moody's Investors Service
lowered its Outlook for Singapore's foreign currency bonds, notes
and bank deposits to "stable" from "positive", citing the
prevailing regional financial turmoil as the reason for this
downgrading, the Business Times reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Singapore's current ratings of Aa1 are
unchanged. But the effect of financial and economic instability in
the Southeast Asian region on Singapore made it less likely that
the ratings for its Aa1 foreign currency country ceilings for
bonds and notes and for bank deposits would be moved upwards in
the near future, the US ratings agency was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
An Outlook rating for both countries and companies is intended
to provide investors with an indication of what could happen to
them under certain scenarios, based on Moody's understanding of
the issues, the industries and the countries that they operate in.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a change in the ratings for Singapore. This is
just a change in the outlook," a Moody's spokesperson said.
</P>
<P>
The US rating agency said that Singapore's current Aa1 ratings
continued to be supported by the country's strong external
financial position, stable political environment, and sound
economic and monetary policies. The spokesperson said that the
current ratings could stay in place until the middle of next year.
</P>
<P>
The Business Times report noted that the latest Moody's
advisory came amid growing concern over the impact of the regional
currency turmoil on the Singapore economy.
</P>
<P>
In particular, analysts have expressed anxiety over Singapore
banks' exposure to the region, where sharp depreciation in
currency values and asset deflation have raised the specter of a
rising rate of non-performing loans, it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MELBOURNE, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Marcelo Rios of Chile
recorded an easy semifinal win on Friday, booking his berth in the
final of the Australian Open against Petr Korda of the Czech
Republic.
</P>
<P>
Rios ended the surprise run of Frenchman Nicolas Escude with a
win of 6-1, 6-3, 6-2 in just one hour and 23 minutes.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first Grand Slam final for ninth-seeded Rios
against sixth-seeded Korda, and also a rematch of their
first-round meeting at the same tournament last year, which Rios
won in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
Against the 81st-ranked Escude, Rios completely dominated the
opening set and broke Escude in the first game of the second.
</P>
<P>
Escude broke back immediately but lost his fifth and ninth
games.
</P>
<P>
Rios, 22, made the quarterfinals of the Australian and
U.S. Opens last year, his previous best in Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
In other semifinal, Korda qualified with a 6-1, 6-4, 1-6, 6-2
victory over Karol Kucera on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Rios and Korda have played six times for three wins apiece.
</P>
<P>
Rios was the first Chilean to play in a semifinal of Grand Slam
in the Open era, which began in 1968, and no Chilean has won a
Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
Korda has played one final, losing the 1992 French Open title
to Jim Courier.

MADRID, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A vote of no confidence in the
board of Spain's club Barcelona was triggered by a group of
Barcelona fans on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The "Blue Elephant" group collected the necessary 6,000
signatures, backed by former coach Johan Cruyff, so as to bid for
ousting club president Jose Luis Nunez.

sure is that the current crisis confounded by Barcelona, who lost
three and drew one in their last four games, would be against the
vote for Nunez and his supporters.
</P>

An earlier poll of fans found out that Louis van Gaal, current
coach for Barcelona, was the most responsible for the situation.

Van Gaal had dropped Bulgarian striker Hristo Stoichkov from

<HEADLINE> Probe Clears PNG PM Skate of Bribery Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- A police investigation has
cleared Papua New Guinea (PNG) Prime Minister Bill Skate of
bribery allegations arising out of secretly filmed videotapes.
</P>
<P>
Police Commissioner Peter Aigilo said the five-week
investigation concluded there was no evidence to support
allegations against Skate, a senior minister and other
politicians.
</P>
<P>
"This should now restore full confidence in their integrity and
credibility," Aigilo was quoted by the Australian Associated Press
from Port Moresby, capital city of PNG, Friday.
</P>
<P>
Later last year, an Australian businessman Mujo Sefa and a
disgruntled former adviser to Skate, was reported to have secretly
filmed videotapes in his Port Moresby office allegedly showing the
prime minister authorizing the payment of bribes.
</P>
<P>
In one tape, Skate boasted he was the godfather of Port
Moresby's criminal gangs and had ordered the killing of a
highlander who had shot at him.
</P>
<P>
The tapes were aired by ABC television last November.
</P>
<P>
Chief investigator, Assistant Commissioner John Toguata, said
the main problem with his inquiries had been Skate's accuser,
Sefa. He said, he traveled to Melbourne to interview Sefa and view
four hours and 20 minutes of tapes.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, there was insufficient evidence to support
the allegations, and Sefa had refused to provide more tapes and
documents which he claimed backed his allegations.
</P>
<P>
Toguata, the chief investigator, announced that investigations
had now been suspended.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Top Four Meet on Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The president, the prime
minister and the chairmen of the two parliament houses of Russia
met in the Kremlin Thursday to discuss economic plans and
strategies for the coming year.
</P>
<P>
ITAR-TASS reported that President Boris Yeltsin voiced
expectations at the meeting that 1998 would be a year of economic
growth in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that to serve this end, the government formulated
a 12-point guideline which would be elucidated in his message to
the parliament.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the 1998 budget would be passed.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Seleznev, Chairman of the State Duma (lower house),
called for measures to raise the economic growth rate. The 0.4
percent growth rate of 1997, he said, was too low.
</P>
<P>
The four officials agreed upon lowering tax rates, especially
those involving energy. They decided to establish a commission to
monitor the implementation of the tax policies.
</P>
<P>
The four also agreed to compensate people for losses in their
bank deposits before 1992 due to the devaluation and re-evaluation
of the ruble.
</P>
<P>
The two houses would work out plans for a sensible settlement
of the problem.
</P>
<P>
In view of the conflicts of opinions among the people as well
as in the parliament on state symbols, the four leaders considered
it wiser not to discuss the legal effectiveness of the state
symbols presently in use.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma rejected recently in its first reading a
presidential bill on the anthem, the emblem and flag of Russia.
</P>
<P>
Seleznev presented Yeltsin with a draft bill for a coalition
government made up of the majority parties in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The president agreed to read the bill, which was drafted on the
basis of the agreement reached by the four officials in their
previous round table meeting.

<HEADLINE> Tourists Spend 60 Billion Dollars in California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Travel spending in
California, America's most visited state, totaled 60.3 billion
U.S. dollars last year, an ongoing annual state tourism conference
was told.
</P>
<P>
Usually 300 million trips are taken within California every
year, generating over 58 billion dollars in sales. Last year's
travel spending grew seven percent as compared with 1996.
</P>
<P>
The industry added 39,000 jobs, boosting the number of travel
and tourism jobs statewide to 667,000. It's payroll grew by 700
million dollars to nearly 12 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is California's third largest export earner, larger
than agriculture, food processing and chemicals combined and
trailing only the export of computers and related technology.
</P>
<P>
The industries of tourism, technology, information and
entertainment have become the mainstay of the state's economy,
which was traditionally propped up by industries of defense, heavy
manufacturing and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Local and state governments benefit from last year's growth.
The overall contribution of travel and tourism to state and local
tax coffers exceeded 3.5 billion dollars, a nine percent increase
over the year before.
</P>
<P>
In an average year, some 9 million visitors tour California,
with such tourist destinations as Los Angeles, San Francisco and
San Diego, and such tourism icons as the Golden Gate Bridge,
Disneyland, Half Dome and the Hollywood Sign.
</P>
<P>
Although international tourism accounts for only three percent
of the total visitor volume, it represents an estimated 24 percent
of the total spending.
</P>
<P>
Last October, California businesses that benefit from tourism
voted to establish the California Marketing Act and tax themselves
to promote travel in the state.
</P>
<P>
The tourism conference, attended by 300 agencies and
businesses, was told that by the end of this year, the amount of
money available for tourism marketing is expected to reach 12.3
million dollars. A 37-member commission will decide how to spend
the money.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong's Second Nuclear Power In Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Nineteen of the 20
construction projects on the Ling'ao Nuclear Power Station in
China's Guangdong Province have been completed since the
construction began in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
Ling'ao is Guangdong's second nuclear power station, and
preparations for a third, the Yangjiang Power Station, are
underway, according to Zan Yunlong, general manager of the
Guangdong Nuclear Power Group Co. Ltd..
</P>
<P>
Agreements on almost all the equipment supply, project
construction and services related to Ling'ao have been concluded,
which have ensured the smooth going of the whole nuclear power
station, Zan said.
</P>
<P>
The Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station, the first nuclear power
plant in the province went into operation in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Daya Bay, Ling'ao's overall design, management,
construction, and installation are all being done by Chinese, a
sign that Guangdong has become self-reliant instead of mainly
using imported capital and technology, Zan noted.
</P>
<P>
The smooth operation at Daya Bay for the past four years has
provided good experience and generated 44.2 billion KWH, 29
billion of which were for Hong Kong, the official says.
</P>
<P>
It has paid more than 200 million yuan in taxes, and paid off
2.4 billion yuan in loans by the end of 1997, accounting for 46
percent of its debt.

<P>
SAN JOSE, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Paraguayan President Juan
Carlos Wasmosy finished a 24-hour visit to Costa Rica Thursday
aimed at improving relations between Mercosur and Central America.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the visit, Wasmosy and his Costa Rican
counterpart, Jose Maria Figueres, signed a joint declaration,
which highlighted the importance of establishing strong links
between Central America and Mercosur, a regional commercial bloc
comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents signed an agreement to promote mutual
investments between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The planned negotiations for the creation of the America Free
Trade Area (AFTA) was another major topic between the two
presidents.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the controvery over the fast-track legislation
within the United States posed a major obstacle to the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Because of objections to the fast track, the U.S. Congress
loses its capability of modifying the agreement negotiated by the
president and can only approve or reject it in full.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica is holding the presidency of AFTA until the Fourth
Ministerial Meeting scheduled to be held here in March.
</P>
<P>
A definitive proposal for launching negotiations in an April
summit in Santiago, Chile, must come out after the March meeting.
</P>
<P>
Wasmosy, who travels in a Paraguayan Air Force plane with a
delegation of politicians and businessmen, left here for El
Salvador after the visit.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian dollar continued
its free fall and slid to a new record low Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The languishing Canadian dollar dropped to 68.25 cents U.S. at
the North American market Thursday, down 0.32 cent from
Wednesday's historic low.
</P>
<P>
It's the third record low the currency has had in as many days.
</P>
<P>
And no one can say for sure where or when the Canadian dollar
will stop its fall, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien did not show any alarm
about the Canadian dollar's slide Thursday, insisting that it
should be performing better.
</P>
<P>
"We have no more deficit, we don't have inflation, unemployment
is declining, we have begun to pay the debt, but the (Canadian)
dollar is lower than it should be," Chretien said.
</P>
<P>
He made no suggestion that the Bank of Canada would raise
interest rates to shore up the currency.
</P>
<P>
"It's the market that decides on the Canadian dollar," Chretien
noted.

Guillermo Coppola, Maradona's agent in the late 1980s, was met

MOSCOW, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin

</P>
<P>
ITAA-TASS reported that Yeltsin made this announcement when

<HEADLINE> Bankruptcies And Mergers Now Common Reforms In Southwestern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The names of at least 40 large
and medium-sized enterprises disappeared in the past nine months
from the roster of state companies in Sichuan Province, one of
China's important industrial bases.
</P>
<P>
Businesses here or from other provinces and Hong Kong purchased
21 bankrupt state enterprises and bought into another 20, as part
of the province's effort to restructure its hard-pressed state
enterprises, according to a provincial state sector administration
official recently.
</P>
<P>
One example was Mianyang city where 20 companies, including
private firms, spent 770 million yuan on 20 of its enterprises,
Mayor Yang Haiqing said, adding that another 47 businesses are
going through the legal procedures needed to declare bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
Some powerful enterprises have joined the effort. The Changhong
Electronics Group, China's largest color TV producer, took over
Sichuan's largest enterprise ever to go bankrupt, the Wuzhou Power
Supply Plant, in a 72.5 million yuan purchase agreement.
</P>
<P>
Industry insiders have predicted even more bankruptcies and
mergers in China, as the central government decides to get the
poorly-operating state sector out of difficulties in three years.
To support the move, the People's Bank of China, the country's
central bank, is planning on offsetting 1.2 billion yuan in bad
loans by the state sector in an effort to help some enterprises
declare bankruptcy or merge, the deputy director of the
province's Economic and Trade Commission, Tang Jian, has said.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Wool Prices Fall by 4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Australia's wool prices fell
by an average four percent at Sydney and Adelaide sales during the
week.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Council of Wool Exporters (ACWE) said Friday in
its weekly review, "the potential for widespread and protracted
disruption on the waterfront has also not done anything to improve
anyone's confidence level at the present time."
</P>
<P>
ACWE said the eastern market indicator fell 26 cents this week
to close at 629 cents per kilogram down.
</P>
<P>
With no sale in Fremantle, the western market indicator
remained at 612 cents per kilogram clean this week.
</P>
<P>
ACWE's national price indicator dropped 22 cents to 661 cents
per kilogram clean.
</P>
<P>
"The occasion of the holiday period in Asia associated with the
Chinese New Year simply compounded problems experienced in recent
weeks of reduced competition in the market place and delays in
payment resulting from unopened letters of credit against
contracts negotiated last year," ACWE said.
</P>
<P>
"Most exporters are now holding off from buying to fill orders
until payment has been guaranteed."
</P>
<P>
This week a total of 57,599 bales were offered for sale with a
pass in rate of 27.5 percent, comprising 21.6 percent in Adelaide
and 30.9 percent in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
About 84,000 bales are rostered for sale next week in Goulburn,
Melbourne and Fremantle.

OTTAWA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien discussed with U.S. President Bill Clinton the issue of
Iraq over the telephone Thursday, the local media reported.
</P>
<P>
Clinton called Chretien Thursday morning to discuss various
issues, including Iraq, but didn't request military support, media
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Meeting the press after a cabinet meeting, Chretien did not say
whether Canada would join a U.S.-led military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Canadian prime minister called it a "hypothetical
question."
</P>
<P>
"If he were to move to the stage of military action against
Iraq, there would be other discussions, but we are not at this
stage at this moment," Chretien said.
</P>
<P>
"I told the president that we hoped they would find a
diplomatic solution to this very difficult problem, but this can't
carry on forever this way," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that Saddam Hussein will respect in good faith the
decisions of the United Nations," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president was reported to be briefing NATO members
about a possible military strike against Iraq if diplomacy fails
to force Iraq to give U.N. arms inspectors unfettered access to
all suspected sites.

<HEADLINE> World Bank President to Visit Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank's President
James Wolfensohn will make a working visit to Indonesia on
February 3 to give support to the country's labor-intensive
program, official Antara News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report said Wolfensohn will be here until February 5.
Before ending his visit, he is believed to meet Indonesian
government officials and discuss with them the current monetary
crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank had joined the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
and the Asian Development Bank in a bailout package to help
Indonesia overcome its economic and financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
In October last year, they agreed to grant Indonesia a
three-year technical assistance package of 23 billion US dollars.
In exchange, the Indonesian government agreed to conduct economic
and financial reforms.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is facing with the worst economic difficulties for
the past 30 years after hitting by the monetary crisis since July
last year. The value of Indonesian rupiah against the US dollar
has dropped from 2,400 per dollar early July last year to 12,000
per dollar on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
AS a result of the monetary crisis, many middle and small
enterprises in the country have closed and the unemployment rate
has increased sharply.
</P>
<P>
According to government officials, the number of unemployment
in the country this year is expected to hit 7.1 million. To
resolve the problem, the Indonesian government is making efforts
to launch a labor-intensive program in a bid to create job
opportunities in the country.

<HEADLINE> Italy Hopes No Recourse to Force Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini on Thursday voiced hope that there would be no recourse to
force against Baghdad in the ongoing inspection tug-of-war between
Iraq and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Dini made the remark upon his arrival in Gorizia, a city in
northeastern Italy, for a conference on economic relations with
eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
On being asked to comment on statements made by United States
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright which did not rule out a
U.S. intervention against Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, the foreign
minister said: "I hope they don't do it."
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Albright said Washington would be ready to launch
a unilateral strike against Iraq unless it allowed unfettered
United Nations weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, the secretary of state said in Paris that
diplomatic solutions to end the crisis over Iraq "are all but
exhausted."
</P>
<P>
Albright spoke following a meeting with French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine after flying to Europe to press for a tough
international response to Iraq's refusal to open suspected sites
to U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said "all options remain open" for resolving the
crisis, but Iraq should unconditionally accept United Nations
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Until now, France had been more allied with Russia in opposing
the use of force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Washington, however, can rely on British support if a strike is
launched. British naval forces are on standby in the Gulf.

BUCHAREST, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Romania's boxing authorities
on Thursday banned their most promising boxers for a year for
refusing to train with the country's Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
"Dorel and Marian Simion are both banned for a year under
Romanian Boxing Federation (FRB) rules, which impose serious
punishment for insubordination," FRB general secretary Paul Novac
said.

The two brothers, gold and bronze medallists at the 1997 World
Cup in Budapest, failed to respond to a federation ultimatum on
Wednesday giving them 24 hours to join the team.
</P>
<P>
"This means the FRB has disqualified them from all national and
international contests from February 1," Novac said.
</P>
<P>
The pair, Romania's only medallists at last year's world cup,
had retreated to a mountain training camp run by their father,
dismissed on Wednesday as coach of the country's under 21 team.

The ban puts the two brothers out of next May's European

rates last year led to a deterioration in the banking system's
loan portfolio, local press reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that as of last October, the level of past-due
loans had risen to 64.25 billion pesos or 4.38 percent of the
total loan portfolio, up almost two percentage points from the
pre-peso devaluation level.
</P>
<P>
However, when compared with other countries also trapped in the
Asian currency crisis, the level of bad loans in the Philippines
is lower, economists noticed.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Governor of the Central Bank Alberto Reyes was quoted as
saying that the growth of bad loans were expected while
individuals and corporations found greater difficulties in
repaying their loans now carrying higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
So far, there were 21 corporations demanding repayment
moratorium as higher interest rates have forced them to stop
expansion or allow them to get no access to more credits needed.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank jacked up interest rates in a bid to stabilize
the exchange rate when the peso began to devaluate last July. The
move failed to curb the depreciation of the peso. In addition, it
hurt the country's economy, especially the manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank is calling on some 56 commercial banks, both
local and foreign, to grant debt repayment moratoria to those
individuals and companies concerned.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Businessmen Demand End of Cuba Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan-American Chamber
of Commerce and Industry (Venamcham) has demanded the end of the
35-year-old U.S. economic embargo against Cuba, which it described
as "a failure."
</P>
<P>
In a statement published by the local press today, Venamcham
vice-president Antonio Herrera Vaillant said that "the embargo is
a failure, it never made sense, and now that failure is more
evident."
</P>
<P>
The Venamcham vice-president said it would be convenient to
open commerce with Cuba, especially of food and medicines, which
is a necessity.
</P>
<P>
It is a matter for thought that U.S. President Bill Clinton did
not mention Cuba in his State of the Union address as he did in
previous years, said Herrera.
</P>
<P>
The end of the Cuba embargo is also supported by the Latin
American Association of Chambers of Commerce, of which Venamcham
is a member, he added.

ATHENS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A Ukrainian Airliner confiscated
by Greece remained Grounded at the Macedonia airport in northern
Greece on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The seizure of the Boeing 737 aircraft, which belongs to
Ukraine's Aerosweet Airlines, was ordered by a first instance
court shortly after its landing at the airport on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The plane, with 46 passengers from Kiev, would reportedly be
kept at the airport until Aerosweet paid relatives of a victim
killed along with 73 others in a crash last month.
</P>
<P>
On December 17, a Ukrainian Yacovlev-42 passenger plane rashed
into northern Greece's Peoria mountain range just before landing at
the same airport, all 74 passengers and crew were killed in the
incident.
</P>
<P>
Greek police said that the plane was the only property asset of
the airlines in Greece and that was why it was confiscated.
</P>
<P>
The Greek court made the decision on a 1935 Warsaw agreement
saying companies could be asked by national courts to pay damages
to crash victims' relatives.

<HEADLINE> Astronomers Glimpse Planet Orbiting Sun's Closest Star </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Astronomers may have caught the
glimpse of a giant planet orbiting the star closest to our solar
system, The Times newspaper said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The planet, ten times the size of Jupiter, has been observed in
orbit around Proxima Centauri, which is just 4.2 light years (40
million kilometers) from the Sun.
</P>
<P>
The new planet, seen using the Hubble Space Telescope, appears
as faint points of light lying close to Proxima Centauri, which is
a tiny, dim star with a mass only one-tenth that of the Sun.
</P>
<P>
A team led by Al Schultz of the Space Telescope Science
Institute in Baltimore, the United States, took two pictures three
months apart and concluded that the point of light had moved over
that period.
</P>
<P>
The most plausible explanation for the movement is that the
light comes from an object in orbit around the star, researchers
said.
</P>
<P>
The team has ruled out other explanations, such as instrument
error, or another star in the background.
</P>
<P>
But other scientists have suggested that it might be a brown
dwarf, a failed star which is too small to shine.
</P>
<P>
However, if confirmed, it will be the first planet in orbit
around a star other than the Sun to be directly observed.
</P>
<P>
So far about a dozen planets have been detected around distant
stars but always by indirect methods, The Times said.
</P>
<P>
Although it is unlikely to be habitable even it is a planet,
"the fact that it exists at all is exciting, for it increases the
chances that somewhere else we may find another Earth." the
newspaper said in a commentary.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Repeats Warning to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on
Thursday repeated his warning to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
that the United States would not allow Iraq to use weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to deny him the capacity to use weapons of
mass destruction again," he told the top U.S. military
commanders from around the world gathering at Fort McNair near
Washington.
</P>
<P>
The saber-rattling remarks were first made by the president
in his State of Union address on Tuesday. And his State of Union
address signaled the preparation of a possible military action
with his top officials starting travelling around the world to
explain the U.S. view on the current Iraq crisis over the
weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is now in Paris and
said diplomatic solutions "are all but exhausted." she made the
stern remarks after her talks with French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
And Defense Secretary William Cohen warned that the opening
of the window for diplomacy "is narrowing." He pointed out that
the United States has enough forces in place in the Gulf region
to counter any threat from Iraq to U.S. force.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, Clinton called Canadian Prime Minister
Jean Chretien and consulted further with him on the situation in
Iraq, the White House said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders "agreed that relevant U.N. Security Council
resolutions were very important and that they should be
respected and that the government of Iraq's (flouting) of those
resolutions is not acceptable," White House spokesman Mike
McCurry told reporters.
</P>
<P>
It was Clinton's third call to a foreign leader this week on
Iraq. The president first conferred with German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and then talked through telephone with British Prime
Minister Tony Blair on Tuesday on the same subject.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said Clinton also planned to speak to French
President Jacques Chirac "very soon" on Iraq as well as to other
foreign leaders in coming days.
</P>
<P>
"He's consulting closely with friends, other members of the
Security Council, as we consider next steps necessary to respond
to what has been the unwillingness of the government of Iraq to
meet its international obligations," McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
The main point of the calls has been to discuss Iraq's
refusal to permit unfettered inspections by U.N. weapons
inspectors amid growing speculation that the United States is
edging toward military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Ottawa said Chretien told reporters after his
telephone conversation with Clinton that he and the U.S.
president "hoped that they will find a diplomatic solution to
this very difficult problems, but this cannot carry on forever
this way."
</P>
<P>
But Chretien would not say if Canada would offer military
support once the United States stages a sustained air strike on
Iraq. But he also said Clinton had not requested any.

WASHINGTON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today strongly condemned the bomb explosion against an abortion
clinic in Birmingham, Alabama, this morning, calling it "an
unforgivable act that strikes at the heart of constitutional
freedoms and individual liberties."
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, he said federal agents are in southern
Birmingham to help local officials bring "the perpetrators of this
terrible crime to justice."
</P>
<P>
The explosion ripped through the New Woman All Women Health
Care clinic at 7:30 a.m., killing an off-duty police officer and
critically injuring a nurse.
</P>
<P>
Authorities evacuated students at nearby dormitories of the
University of Alabama at Birmingham out of concern a second bomb
could detonate.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms confirmed that the explosion was caused by a bomb. No
second explosive device was immediately found, but the area around
the clinic remained secured.
</P>
<P>
The blast came just a week after the nation marked the 25th
anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing
abortion. There was an anti-abortion march in the city on Saturday
to observed the 25th anniversary of the law.
</P>
<P>
A year ago, two bombs went off within an hour at a clinic in
Atlanta, injuring seven people.
</P>
<P>
The New Woman clinic, operating for 11 years, is one of four
Alabama abortion clinics that filed suit to block the state from
enforcing two new state laws restricting certain late-term
abortions.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Leading World CEOs Have Confidence on Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, Switzerland, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A survey presented
here today to the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum has
shown that more than half of the CEOs have confidence on Asia
despite the current financial crisis there.
</P>
<P>
Evaluating all the emerging economies, 23 percent of the CEOs
surveyed rank China and 28 percent rank Asia outside of China as
offering the greatest opportunity for business overall, according
to the survey sponsored jointly by the World Economic Forum and
Price Waterhouse, the worldwide professional services and
consulting organization.
</P>
<P>
The survey has also found that 62 percent of the CEOs are
optimistic about growth prospects for the next three years, and
another 33 percent are "extremely optimistic" about growth for
this period.
</P>
<P>
"The trend toward globalization will continue strongly into the
next century as leaders of the world's largest companies intensify
corporate growth strategies to increase their business and to
expand into new markets," said Price Waterhouse CEO James J.
Schiro.
</P>
<P>
Other key findings include:
</P>
<P>
-- 32 percent of the CEOs rank Latin America as the region with
the best opportunities for business;
</P>
<P>
-- In ranking the obstacles to growth, 41 percent of the CEOs
rated government regulation as a major obstacle;
</P>
<P>
-- 79 percent of the CEOs surveyed believe electronic commerce
will either "completely reshape competition" in their industries
(20 percent) or "significantly impact" their industries (59
percent).
</P>
<P>
The 377 CEOs surveyed represent 2000 of the largest global
companies that generated 2,231 billion US dollars and employ more
than eight million people at year-end 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen today urged the nation's mayors to support
additional unused military base closures.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Cohen said that
the Base Realignment and Closure program would be helpful to
redevelopment programs and create new jobs.
</P>
<P>
He listed a number of cities that have turned shuttered bases
into burgeoning business centers with thousands of new jobs.
</P>
<P>
The defense secretary said even though the United States has
far fewer submarines and aircraft in its arsenal since the end of
the Cold War, no corresponding cutback has occurred in the numbers
of Navy piers or Air Force bases.
</P>
<P>
"This gap between force structure and infrastructure represents
billions of dollars going to bases we don't need, the very same
billions of dollars we need to maintain readiness and modernize
our forces," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said he expects to hear opposition from Congress next
week when he presents his budget request to Capitol Hill, which
will include base closures.

</P>
<P>
Speaking here today at the opening session of the 1998 annual

"Major economies must recognize that their conduct of
macroeconomic policies will inevitably have an impact upon other
countries as well as the global economy as a whole," Chuan

Issues like the maintenance of currency stability in China, the
effective stimulation of Japan's domestic economy and continued
and expanded market access to Europe and North America should
receive prompt attention by the major industrialized economies, in
particular from the G-7 countries, working in concert with other
large economies such as China, the Thai leader pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He warned, "If countries in other regions remain aloof or
pursue policies that further deteriorate the situation in Asia, we
shall face not only recession on a global scale, but will raise
fundamental questions about the value of economic liberalization
which we all desire."
</P>
<P>
In the medium and long terms, Chuan went on, collective global
efforts should be made to strengthen the international financial
and monetary system in order to prevent a similar crisis from
arising and spreading in the future.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said that he firmly believes that in not too long a time,
East Asia will resume its place as one of the engines of world
growth.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor Investigates Perjury in Clinton Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Independent counsel Kenneth
Starr has been authorized to investigate whether former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky "or others" suborned perjury,
obstructed justice, intimidated witnesses or violated other
federal laws, according to a U.S. court order released on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The order by the U.S. Court of Appeals, dated January 16, gave
Starr authority to investigate whether these crimes were committed
in dealings with witnesses and others in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment case against U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The order gave Starr the power to conduct his recent criminal
investigation into whether Clinton had an affair with Lewinsky and
urged her to deny it under oath. Clinton has repeatedly denied the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
In asking the court to expand Starr's Whitewater investigation,
Attorney General Janet Reno said she had received information from
Starr that Lewinsky "may have submitted a false affidavit and
suborned perjury from another witness" in the Paula Jones case.
</P>
<P>
Reno said that Lewinsky said in a taped conversation with a
cooperating witness -- an obvious reference to Lewinsky's friend
Linda Tripp -- that she intended to lie when making a pre-trial
statement under oath.
</P>
<P>
"In the same conversation, she urges the cooperating witness to
lie in her own upcoming deposition," Reno said in papers dated
January 16 and released on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Before the Clinton sex-scandal allegations arose, Starr had
been investigating the Whitewater land deal involving Bill and
Hillary Clinton in the 1980s, and other White House controversies.
</P>
<P>
The possible crimes cited in the order involved dealings with
"witnesses, potential witnesses, attorneys or others" in the Paula
Jones sexual harassment case, which has been scheduled to go to
trial in Little Rock later this year.
</P>
<P>
The court order stated that Starr should have the authority to
investigate whether "any person or entity... has engaged in an
unlawful conspiracy" or "has aided or abetted any federal
offense."
</P>
<P>
It said Starr "shall have jurisdiction and authority to
investigate crimes, such as... any obstruction of... justice or
any material false testimony or statement in violation of federal
criminal law arising out of his investigation of the matter."
</P>
<P>
Starr had requested that the order be disclosed, and the three
judges said its release "would be in the best interest of
justice."

<HEADLINE> IIF Reports Net Private Capital Flows to Leading Emerging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The financial crises in Asia
led to a major decline in net private capital flows to leading
emerging markets in 1997 and may cause a moderate further drop in
1998.
</P>
<P>
This marks the first major retrenchment of capital flows by
international investors to emerging markets this decade, the
Institute of International Finance (IIF) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The IIF, the global association of financial institutions with
over 280 members estimated that total net private capital flows to
the 29 leading emerging market economies in 1997 totaled 199.6
billion U.S. dollars, down from the record level of 295.2 billion
dollars in 1996. The IIF projected that the 1998 total will be
around 171.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In its new report entitled "Capital Flows to Emerging Markets",
the Institute stressed that net private flows into the five
economies of Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, South Korea and
Thailand which have been mostly affected by the financial crisis,
fell from 93 billion dollars in 1996 to an outflow of 12 billion
dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, flows to the other leading emerging market economies,
including other economies in Asia, picked up in 1997 to 212
billion dollars from 202 billion dollars in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Georges Blum, Chairman of the IIF, told a press conference
in Zurich, Switzerland Thursday:"The crisis in Asia has certainly
had a major impact on flows to most seriously affected countries.
However, in 1997, it is remarkable that in these circumstances
flows to all other major emerging markets actually increased,
demonstrating that contagion in flows has been limited."
</P>
<P>
Equity flows accounted for around 65 percent of all net private
flows in 1997, with the bulk of this attributable to foreign
direct investment, "which indicates a continuing strong interest
in these countries by international businesses," noted Dr. Blum.
</P>
<P>
The IIF estimated that, largely due to the crisis, official
capital flows rose to nearly 30 billion dollars in 1997, from just
under 3 billion dollars in 1996 and a further 30 billion dollars
of such flows are likely in 1998. The IIF noted that commitments
for other international assistance totaling over 100 billion
dollars have been mobilized for Indonesia, South Korea and
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
On the private creditor side, the IFC estimated a decline in
net flows of around 100 billion dollars in 1997 to a total of 66
billion dollars and it projected to a further decline to a total
of roughly 40 billion dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The decline seen last year was due to reductions in net new
flows from banks to emerging market economies, while the 1998
projections involve an expectation of a significant decline in new
bond issues. Total 1998 net funds from non-bank private creditors
are expected to be 40 billion dollars following a drop to 70
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
As a group, the real gross domestic product (GDP) of the
leading emerging market economies in 1998 is forecast to decline
to 2.9 percent from 4.9 percent in the last two years. The
Asian-Pacific emerging economies are expected to grow by 2.8
percent this year, which is the lowest level seen in a generation
and compares with 6.2 percent and 8.0 percent growth in 1997 and
1996 respectively. Growth in Latin America is projected to decline
to 3.3 percent this year, after 5.1 percent growth in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the exchange rate changes and other major
adjustments in Asia are expected to contribute to the Asia-Pacific
countries as a group recording a current account surplus of
possibly 26 billion dollars this year, following a deficit of
around 2.4 billion dollars in 1997. The change will contribute to
a rebuilding in the foreign exchange reserves of these countries.

<HEADLINE> Irish Govt Publishes Bloody Sunday Killings Evidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 29 (Xinhua) - The Irish government published
Thursday a dossier on the Bloody Sunday killings, which condemned
fundmental flaws in the original British report into the incident.
</P>
<P>
It accused its author Lord Widgery, then Lord Chief Justice of
England, of "tainting the victims with responsibility for their
own deaths".
</P>
<P>
Widgery's report largely exonerated British paratroopers of
blame for firing on demonstrators in the streets of Londonderry on
January 30, 1972.
</P>
<P>
The Irish government, which had earlier submitted its dossier
to the British government, was harshly critical of the report,
saying it was "fundmentally flawed".
</P>
<P>
The new material put forward in the Irish government dossier
included a selection of civilian eyewitness statements that were
subitted to the Widgery Tribunal but not considered by it.
</P>
<P>
The evidence was released as British Prime Minister Tony Blair
announced this afternoon a new independent judicial inquiry into
the shooting dead of 14 civil rights marchers by British troops in
the incident.

<HEADLINE> British Researchers Find Language Gene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- For the first time, a gene
suspected of playing a key role in language has been located by a
team of British scientists, a British magazine said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Geneticist Anthony Monaco and colleagues at Oxford University
have narrowed their search of the gene to a small section of human
chromosome 7, which they named SPEECH 1.
</P>
<P>
"It's a well-mapped area, so the rest of our work should go
quickly." Monaco was quoted by New Scientist as saying.
</P>
<P>
The advance has been possible because of a family living in
London which suffers an unusual language disorder.
</P>
<P>
About half the family of 30 have difficulty co-ordinating the
physical movements necessary for speech and they also have trouble
with grammar.
</P>
<P>
Genetic analysis revealed that the condition was caused by a
single, dominant mutation that could be traced back to one of
their grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
Researchers analyzed different chromosome segments, reasoning
that afflicted members of the family should share the
grandmother's version of the regions.
</P>
<P>
Two closely spaced segments of chromosome 7 showed a perfect
match. They were present in 15 linguistically impaired relatives,
but absent in 12 healthy ones.
</P>
<P>
The discovery may help explain why many speech and language
disorders arise, New Scientist said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls Canadian Leader on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
called Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien on Thursday and
consulted further with him on the situation in Iraq, the White
House said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders "agreed that relevant U.N. Security Council
resolutions were very important and that they should be
respected and that the government of Iraq's (flouting) of those
resolutions is not acceptable," White House spokesman Mike
McCurry told reporters.
</P>
<P>
It was Clinton's third call to a foreign leader this week on
Iraq. The president first conferred with German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and then talked through telephone with British Prime
Minister Tony Blair on Tuesday on the same subject.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said Clinton also planned to speak to French
President Jacques Chirac "very soon" on Iraq as well as to other
foreign leaders in coming days.
</P>
<P>
"He's consulting closely with friends, other members of the
Security Council, as we consider next steps necessary to respond
to what has been the unwillingness of the government of Iraq to
meet its international obligations," McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
The main point of the calls has been to discuss Iraq's
refusal to permit unfettered inspections by U.N. weapons
inspectors amid growing speculation that the United States is
edging toward military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Ottawa said Chretien told reporters after his
telephone conversation with Clinton that he and the U.S.
president "hoped that they will find a diplomatic solution to
this very difficult problems, but this cannot carry on forever
this way."
</P>
<P>
But Chretien would not say if Canada would offer military
support once the United States stages a sustained air strike on
Iraq. But he also said Clinton had not requested any.

<HEADLINE> IDB Finances Judicial Reform in Argentina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank today announced the approval of a 10.5 million
U.S. dollar loan to back reform and modernization of Argentina's
justice system.
</P>
<P>
The program is expected to lower the transaction costs
associated with legal proceedings by introducing new management
and administration systems in the public prosecutor and defense
offices, strengthening provincial courts, training officials and
developing information systems.
</P>
<P>
An information system for penitentiaries will improve access to
the legal system by the prison population.
</P>
<P>
The resources will also finance the development of a legal
compendium that will classify and consolidate current national
legislation into an orderly digest.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the program is estimated at 21 million
dollar. Apart from the IDB loan, local counterpart funds total
10.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
During 1997, the IDB approved nearly 1 billion dollars in loans
for Argentina, investing in such areas as energy, technical
education and professional training, small enterprise development,
modernization of the tax system, environmental protection and
social services for the poor.
