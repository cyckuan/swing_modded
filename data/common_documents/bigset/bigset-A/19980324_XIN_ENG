<HEADLINE> N.Irish Deal Possible if Protestants Flexible,Adams Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- A political settlement to the
Northern Ireland conflict was possible if the Protestants show
flexibility, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said before the start of the peace talks in Belfast that the
leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, David Trimble, "who has been
resisting change and tries to prevent change, has to move into a
new mode."
</P>
<P>
"To bring about change in this situation, it needs to be
driven. Mr Trimble is a learner driver and can't be left in the
driving seat. (British Prime Minister Tony) Blair has to drive
change forward on every issue that has been mapped out for
change," Reuters quoted him say saying.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army
(IRA), was briefly expelled from the talks last month after police
blamed two murders on the IRA. The party returned to the talks on
Monday to conclude the last stage peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Britain and Ireland want all the parties involved in Northern
Ireland peace talks to agree a peace package by April 9 that they
could submit to referendum in both parts of Ireland in late May.

<HEADLINE> China Experiences Warming Trend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- China experienced a warming trend
during 1997, according to the '97 China Climate Bulletin released
today, the World Meteorological Day, by the China Meteorological
Administration (CMA).
</P>
<P>
With the exception of the Tibet Autonomous region, 1997
regional temperatures for 29 provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities were higher than the average in previous years. The
bulletin indicated that Shanxi, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces
recorded the highest temperatures since 1949.
</P>
<P>
"The warming trend in China is basically occurring in tandem
with global warming," according to CMA Director Wen Kegang
</P>
<P>
Global temperatures have risen by between 0.3 and 0.6 degrees
Celsius since the late 19th century, with the average temperature
for the past decade setting a record high for the past 110 years,
said Wen.
</P>
<P>
Northern China experienced an abnormally hot summer last year,
with temperatures north of the Yangtze River averaging two degrees
Celsius higher than for the same period in previous years,
according to the bulletin.
</P>
<P>
However, summer temperatures for most parts of Southern China
fell by one degree Celsius.
</P>
<P>
Temperatures of over 35 degrees Celsius lingered for a period
of more than ten days in north and northwestern parts of China,
with some areas suffering heat waves lasting over 60 days.
</P>
<P>
China has also experienced warm winters for the past 11 years,
according to the bulletin, with 1997 winter temperatures in
northern China rising two degrees Celsius above average
levels. Winter temperatures in southern China were also one degree
Celsius higher.
</P>
<P>
"Related facts indicate that China's climate is turning
warmer," said Wen, adding that "there are certain fluctuations for
different areas in different periods."
</P>
<P>
The bulletin also indicated that climatic conditions created
catastrophic conditions during 1997, with widespread drought in
northern China causing substantial damage to the nation's
agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
Four typhoons which hit coastal areas over a comparatively
short period during 1997 resulted in major economic losses.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian President Meets Qatari Emir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin
Khalifa al-Thani, who arrived here Monday afternoon, held a
brief meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, the Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari emir's two-day visit was widely viewed as a
fence-mending effort aimed at ending disputes between the two
countries over Doha's accusation of Cairo's role in a failed coup
and Egypt's boycott of an economic conference held in Qatar last
November.
</P>
<P>
The emir and Mubarak were expected to hold talks further.
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement upon his arrival, the Qatari leader
praised the efforts Mubarak had made in realizing solidarity,
peace and security of the Arab nations, as well as Egypt's stance
on these issues.
</P>
<P>
He described his trip to Cairo as part of the continued
coordination and discussion with the Egyptian leadership on
bilateral ties, regional and international issues of mutual
interest.
</P>
<P>
"It reflects the deep friendship between the two brotherly
peoples... I hope it will contribute to strengthening our
bilateral relations and cooperation," he added.
</P>
<P>
The relations of the two Arab countries soured in 1996 when
Qatar alleged Egyptian involvement in a failed coup in Qatar.
</P>
<P>
The ties worsened after Cairo boycotted the Middle East and
North Africa economic conference hosted by Doha last
November. Egypt recalled its ambassador, and sent him back later.
</P>
<P>
A summit meeting mediated by Saudi King Fahd between the Qatari
emir and Mubarak at the end of last year failed to bridge the
gap between the two sides. Qatar later expelled Egyptian laborers.
</P>
<P>
But a thaw seemed to have set in the relations after the two
countries signed an agreement earlier this month to allow Egyptian
workers back to finish their contract terms in Qatar.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari emir was accompanied by a top-ranking delegation,
including Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jabir
al-Thani, Minister of State in the Cabinet Sheikh Mohammad Bin
Khaled al-Thani and Chief of the Emir Cabinet Abdullah Bin Khalifa
Al Atya.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- A reliable marine meteorological
service is critical to Shanghai's shipping transportation and the
exploration of marine resources, according to a seminar held today
to mark World Meteorological Day.
</P>
<P>
Accurate and timely meteorological forecasts not only reassure
Shanghai's 100,000 fishermen who set to sea on a regular basis,
but also help to avoid heavy losses resulting from disastrous
weather conditions such as typhoons, according to Xu Yiming,
deputy director of the Shanghai Municipal Meteorological Bureau.
</P>
<P>
He noted the remarkable achievements of the city's
meteorological department have yielded substantial social and
economic returns in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the Shanghai international Shipping Center and
various large-scale coastal projects has increased the demand for
marine meteorological forecasts, according to Zhang Youfen, deputy
director of the Shanghai Oceanography Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Central Meteorological Observatory serves as the
center for weather and tropical cyclone forecasts along China's
east coast. The observatory's services are as far distant as Japan
and Singapore.

<HEADLINE> Bank Chairman Welcomes Foreign Partners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Foreign partners, including the
Asian Development Bank (ADB), are extremely important to
development of the Everbright Bank of China (EBC), according
to EBC Chairman and President Zhu Xiaohua.
</P>
<P>
The ADB holds a three percent stake in the EBC, and its
participation in the decision-making process has enabled
Everbright to standardize and improve its administrative and
managerial activities.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks during the bank's annual meeting, which
opened today in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
He said that many things local bankers can learn from overseas
counterparts cannot be found in textbooks.
</P>
<P>
The ADB is not only a partner, but has granted the EBC 15-year
term trust loans totalling 60 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ADB has allocated 600,000 US dollars to hire
foreign consultants to assist the EBC in efforts to draft
managerment regulations and development goals.
</P>
<P>
Standardized scientific operation mechanisms enabled the EBC to
earn profits of 1.62 billion yuan last year, up 81.9 percent on
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The EBC was restructured into a joint stock bank in 1996, with
capital assets standing at 4.4 billion yuan. The Everbright Group,
headquartered in Beijing, is the majority shareholder, and the
bank's investors include more than 100 domestic and foreign
companies.
</P>
<P>
The EBC funneled 20 percent of its shares into the Hong
Kong-based Everbright Company Ltd. Co., and was the first inland
bank to invest in a listed firm in the new administrative
region.

<P>
HANOI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is building more water
facilities to increase the percentage of rural people with
access to safe water.
</P>
<P>
An official report said Monday that Vietnam is striving to give
42 percent of people living in rural areas access to safe water by
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
It said that Vietnam planned to built another 8,000 water
installations to provide water for 800,000 more people.
</P>
<P>
From 1982 until last year, 177,500 water installations were
built at a total cost of over 51.1 million U.S. dollars, with 55
percent of the money coming from the United Nations Children's
Fund.
</P>
<P>
As a result, 40 percent or 24 million people in rural areas
nationwide have benefited from this program.
</P>
<P>
However, only between 21 and 29 percent of rural population in
the northern mountainous and midland regions, central highlands
and east of the southern regions have access to safe water.

<HEADLINE> China Publishes Catalog of National Essential Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- A catalog of 740 kinds of
chemical drugs has been published to serve as a guideline to
ensure for Chinese doctors to follow when prescribing medicines.
</P>
<P>
The Catalog of Essential Drugs will also serve a major
reference for listing medicines covered by the nation's free
medical service system, according to the National Office for
Essential Drugs.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to help ensure that doctors prescribe drugs
properly, reduce the incidence rate for diseases resulting from
the improper use of drugs, and curb rising medical costs,"
according to Li Shaoli, an official with the aforementioned office.
</P>
<P>
The medical reform plan is currently being implemented, but
China is nonetheless still overburdened by massive medical
expenditures resulting from the existing free "cradle-to-grave"
medical system.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that some doctors prescribe expensive and unnecessary
drugs to patients receiving free medical service has created
massive losses," according to Li.
</P>
<P>
Problems involving drug markets, including unstable quality
levels, have also adversely affected the proper use of medicines,
said Li, adding that "the lack of macro-controls has prompted many
pharmaceutical plants to produce profitable drugs rather than
those needed for clinical applications."
</P>
<P>
Drugs listed in the catalog were selected from over 4,000
domestic and imported products with "proven curative effects,
slight side-effects, stable quality levels and reasonable prices,"
said Li.
</P>
<P>
Related departments will supervise production and ensure the
supply of related drugs.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health and the State Pharmaceutical
Administration jointly formulated the original catalog in
1992. "The catalog will be adjusted every two years in line with
improved technology and changing demand," according to Li.
</P>
<P>
Formulation of a catalog for essential herbal medicines is
underway, according to the Ministry of Health.

BRUSSELS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Asylum seeking to European Union
nations dropped 16 percent in 1996 to 246,000 people, or 46,000
fewer, a return to the 1988 level, Eurostat reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Major falls in numbers of asylum seekers were seen in France,
the Netherlands and Sweden, though rises were posted in Austria,
Belgium, Denmark, Norway and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Around half of all asylum seekers were registered in Germany,
as in the previous four years. Germany received the largest
number of asylum seekers from eight of the Eurostat-listed 10 main
source countries.
</P>
<P>
Topping the Eurostat list of asylum-seeker source countries
were Turkey at 29,143, the former Yugoslavia including
Bosnia-Herzegovina (25,285) and Iraq (22,389) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The other listed countries were the former Soviet republics
combined, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Iran, Romania, Somalia and Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The overall downward trend in the number of asylum seekers to
EU states began in 1993 and continued in 1996, according to

Community.

<HEADLINE> EU Adds Seven Food Products to Protection List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission decided
on Monday to add seven agricultural and food products to its list
of protection by means of special registration.
</P>
<P>
The new additions, four from Germany and three from Italy, will
have their names registered for the protection of geographical
indications and designation of origin.
</P>
<P>
These products have added up to 464 the total of agricultural
and food products protected.
</P>
<P>
The special registration implies that the use of those
registered names is to be confined to producers in a particular
area who comply with closely defined rules and criteria for the
production.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the European Union introduced legislation on
geographical indications and designation of origin in an effort to
harmonize protection at community level in the case of all food
products other than wines and spirit drinks that had already been
covered by earlier legislation.
</P>
<P>
The attempt was aimed at bringing some clarity to the market
and protect the interests of both producers and consumers.

<P>
When a food product becomes well-known outside its area of
origin, it may find itself competing in the marketplace with
imitation products making use of the same name.
</P>
<P>
This unfair competition not only undermines the efforts made by
the producer or manufacturer to acquire the good name but also
leaves consumers confused as to which product is genuine.
</P>
<P>
The European Union member states had tried, prior to 1992, to
protect such agricultural and food products by means of trademark
protection, origin appellations, the legal system and the
recognition as customary usage.

<HEADLINE> Bertelsmann Plans to Buy Random House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The German multimedia giant
Bertelsmann AG announced Monday in Munich that it planned to buy
up Random House, the largest publisher in the United States.
</P>
<P>
It did not disclose how much it would pay for the purchase.
</P>
<P>
Bertelsmann is Europe's largest media concern with an annual
turnover of 25 billion marks (13.8 billion U.S. dollars). Random
House is the largest English-language book publishing group in the
world, having annual revenues of one billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The purchase, which still awaits the approval of U.S. trust
authorities, is expected to strengthen Bertelmann's already top
position in the world's book publishing industry.
</P>
<P>
The company said it would merge its existing book publishing
operations in the United States with those of Random House, and
expected to achieve 2.5 to 3.0 billion marks (1.38-1.67 billion
dollars) in annual revenues.

<HEADLINE> Austrian Hostage Freed By Ethiopian Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mogadishu, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Ogaden National Liberation
Front (ONLF) in Ethiopia has declared on radio that it will
release an Austrian lady caught by its members on humanitarian
ground.
</P>
<P>
On a VHF field radio communicated in Mogadishu here Sunday,
the captives of Miss Birhanec Tamiar said that the Austrian
student coming from Geneva to learn Somali was caught while
trespassing their area of control in Ogadenia, the Somali
dominated Fifth Zone of Ethiopia on February 25 last month.
</P>
<P>
The captives of Tamiar, from the rebellion sub-faction
opposing the Ethiopian government of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi,
said that they did so just to show Ethiopia and the rest of the
world their full determination to claim their territories.
</P>
<P>
On a very short interview with the reporters via VHF radio in
Mogadishu, Miss Tamiar said that she is healthy and treated well
by her captives.
</P>
<P>
She said that she is trying to come back as soon as possible,
but her voice sounded as if she was afraid of saying more.
</P>
<P>
One of the captives who also spoke to reporters said that he
was very sorry for the case. He admitted that a lot of massacres,
robbery, killing, displacement and imprisonment are taking place
in Ogadenia.
</P>
<P>
On her release, the captives said that they're contacting the
Austrian government about it.
</P>
<P>
"Considering the human rights issue, there are no difficulties
in her release," said the captive who declined to reveal his name
or to mention the name of the village or town where they are at
the moment. The lady was caught near Godey town of the Fifth Zone
of Ethiopia while on a lorry.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to captives of the Austrian lady,
they were under mounting pressure after a search party was sent
by the Ethiopian government.
</P>
<P>
The captives took the lady on foot for about a dozen mile at a
time when changing their temporary bases so as to fool the
Ethiopian intelligence searching for them.
</P>
<P>
So far, they have covered more than 200 miles on foot since
the capture of the lady 28 days ago.

<HEADLINE> Juan Somavia of Chile Elected New ILO Director General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Governing Body of the
International Labor Organization (ILO) elected here Monday Juan
Somavia of Chile to serve as the next ILO Director General.
</P>
<P>
Somavia's five-year term of office begins on March 4, 1999. He
was elected by 44 votes out of 56 votes. His opponent, Maria
Nieves Roldan-Confesor of the Philippines received 12 votes.
</P>
<P>
"The election of Somavia marks the first time in the 79-year
history of the ILO that a representative of the Southern
hemisphere has been elected to the post of Director General," said
Chilean Labor Minister Jorge Arrate Mac Niven in a statement
accepting the results of the vote.
</P>
<P>
Niven also said that this was an important day for Chile as the
post of the ILO Director General is "the highest attained by a
Chilean citizen in the UN system to date".
</P>
<P>
Somavia is currently Permanent Representative of Chile to the
United Nations in New York, a position he has held since 1990. He
was born on April 21, 1941 and earned degrees in law and economics
from the Catholic University of Chile and the University of Paris.

<HEADLINE> 900,000 Gallons Radioactive Waste Leaks in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Nearly a million gallons of
radioactive waste has leaked into the ground in central Washington
state and the U.S. government belately acknowledged that it needs
to deal with it, The New York Times reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the Hanford reservation, nuclear weapons
plant in Washington, has not produced plutonium since 1987. But
about 54 million gallons of radioactive waste, in liquid, sludge
and dried salt forms, is stored in 177 underground tanks at
Hanford. Of the tanks, 149 are made of single shell of steel, and
about 68 have leaked, releasing about 900,000 gallons into the
soil.
</P>
<P>
It said the oldest tanks are more than 50 years old, and all
the single-shell tanks are expected to leak eventually.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the Energy Department had said for decades that
no waste from the tanks would reach the ground water in the next
10,000 years at least, but it is already there.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the department admit now that they were
wrong.
</P>
<P>
The Department acknowledged that there has not been sufficient
study on the soil, which is called the vadose zone, the relatively
dry soil above the water table, and it needs to know more about
how plutonium moves through the soil at the plant with the
nation's largest concentration of radioactive waste in the desert
along the Columbia River.
</P>
<P>
The department hoped to have a strategy by October for how to
study the problem, and then amend its clean-up plans for the
nuclear reservation.

<HEADLINE> London Oil Prices Rally on Pact to Reduce Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Oil Prices on the London market
rose sharply Monday on the news that some producers had reached
agreement to cut supplies by two million barrels per day (bpd) in
order to boost international oil prices which have fallen to
nine-year low.
</P>
<P>
World benchmark, Brent blend, whose price slipped to under 12
US dollars last week, opened 1.68 US dollars a barrel higher on
London futures at 14.90 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the oil ministers of Saudi Arabia,
Venezuela and Mexico said in a joint statement Sunday after two
days of secret talks that they decided to undertake an effort to
withdraw from the market an amount of 1.6 to two million bpd,
beginning April 1 until the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the efforts of countries inside and outside of
the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to
rescue the over-supplied oil markets meant prices could keep
rising in the short-term.
</P>
<P>
They forecast that with the two million bpd cut, the Brent
blend would go up to 18 US dollars, but still below last year's 19
dollars average.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices have slumped 8 US dollars since early October last
year due to rampant overproduction, faltering Asian demand and
brimming storage tanks.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Launches TB Drugs Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa launched a
reference center Monday to evaluate drugs used to treat
tuberculosis (TB), currently the country's number one killer.
</P>
<P>
Launching the center a day before the World TB Day on March
24, the Medical Research Council (MRC) said the move was aimed at
improving the quality of TB medication and simplifying the
treatment process.
</P>
<P>
The center, to operate under the council's national TB
research program, will collaborate with several top-flight
universities in South Africa and participate in the World Health
Organization (WHO)'s program on TB, Bernard Fourie of the MRC
said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa had a notoriously high rate of TB infection, 60
times higher than in the United States and western European,
Fourie said.
</P>
<P>
Last year about 160,000 new cases of the disease were
reported, Fourie said. This was 55 percent up from the 103,148
cases registered in 1996.
</P>
<P>
If current trends continue, 3.5 million people would become
sick with TB in the next 10 years, Fourie said. South Africa has
less than 40 million population at present.
</P>
<P>
Fourie said TB patients currently have to take up to 24
tablets every day for six months and that many patients could not
stick to the long treatment program.
</P>
<P>
Those stopping their treatment early could develop
drug-resistant TB strains, which are difficult to treat and fatal
in 70 percent of cases, he said.
</P>
<P>
The center will do research on a fixed dose combination
therapy, which would reduce the number of tablets to a maximum of
five per day, and this would make it easier for patients to
complete their treatment, Fourie said.
</P>
<P>
The center will provide coordinated information on the
effectiveness of anti-TB drugs to all countries of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC), he said.
</P>
<P>
A survey last year showed that TB was the country's number one
killer, killing more South Africans than AIDS, malaria, measles
and murder combined in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma said about
1,000 South Africans were killed by TB every month.

<HEADLINE> Romanian PM on 1998 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The government sent the
long-delayed 1998 draft budget and social security bill to
parliament, Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea told a press conference
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"These bills speak for the major reforms due to be completed
this year", Ciorbea told the press that the Cabinet has managed to
shift emphasis from direct taxes to indirect ones.
</P>
<P>
He expressed belief that the social reform must come once with
the budget.
</P>
<P>
The budget aims to cut the inflation rate to 45 percent this
year from 151 percent last year and to bring the budget deficit
down to 3.6 percent of the GDP, from an estimated 4 percent. It
projects zero growth in the economy, which shrank 6.6 percent
last year.
</P>
<P>
Ciorbea said efforts would be channeled toward structural
reforms and privatization of banks and the State-owned large
enterprises. Over 3 percent of the GDP is allocated in this
respect.
</P>
<P>
Ciorbea's Cabinet approved the draft budget on March 17, but
the Democratic Party, who are the second largest party in the
ruling coalition, dealt Ciorbea a serious blow by refusing to
support the budget until he steps down. The Democratic leader
Petre Roman said that "We shall not give a confidence vote to the
Ciorbea Cabinet by voting the budget". Analysts said that the
bill, without the support of Petre Roman, has little chance of
being approved in the parliament.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Fresh U.N. Peace Efforts for Cyprus Fail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Special Envoy of the U.N.
Secretary-General for Cyprus Diego Cordovez has failed to persuade
the Turkish Cypriots to rejoin the peace process of the divided
island in his latest round of efforts ending on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference on Saturday, Cordovez conceded
that the peace talks between the Turkish Cypriots and the Greek
Cypriots are far from being resumed at present.
</P>
<P>
"For the time being, it is not possible to resume the
negotiations and this creates a very serious problem for the
(U.N.) Secretary-General (Kofi Annan)," he said.
</P>
<P>
During his five-day visit to Cyprus, Cordovez held separate
talks with Cypriot President and Greek Cypriot leader Glafcos
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash in a bid to
revive the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Denktash refused to go back to the negotiating table unless he
is treated as Clerides' political equal, Cordovez said.
</P>
<P>
"It has not been possible to find a solution to this matter
between the two leaders," he added.
</P>
<P>
But the envoy said he has understood Denktash's position very
well and would submit a report to the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has complained of what he called asymmetries arising
from the difference between the two Cypriot leaders, "which have
created elements of discrimination against him in certain ways,"
Cordovez said.
</P>
<P>
Denktash also has felt that European Union's decision to start
accession talks with Cyprus "is an extension of these asymmetries,
which has eroded the value of these negotiations," Cordovez said.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot peace process broke down last summer when Denktash,
angered by EU's decision, walked out of his talks with Clerides,
which were under the auspices of Cordovez.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has ever since insisted that the peace process will be
put back on track only when his breakaway Turkish state in
northern Cyprus is internationally recognized.
</P>
<P>
He has ordered a suspension of bicommunal contacts, turned down
an invitation to join the Cypriot delegation for the accession
talks with the EU and refused to meet with officials of the EU and
its member states.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island to protect
the Turkish Cypriot minorities after a failed coup by Greek
supporters of union of Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared in 1983 the
breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," only recognized
by Ankara, against the internationally recognized Republic of
Cyprus dominated by Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has been trying for decades to help reunify
the island under a "bizonal and bicommunal formula" through peace
talks. But so far no tangible results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
"Now we need guidance from the (U.N.) Security Council on how
to proceed (with the Cyprus peace process)," Cordovez said.
</P>
<P>
But one thing is certain, he stressed, the U.N. will not meet
Denktash's demand for formal recognition of himself and his state.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez warned of waning international interest in and
keenness on the Cyprus problem if the two sides are not ready to
show their political will for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
But he pledged that the U.N. will keep on knocking at the doors
of the interlocutors in Cyprus in the hope that they will open one
day.

<HEADLINE> WMO Marks World Meteorological Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The oceans covering over two
thirds of the Earth have a major influence on global climate and
on daily weather conditions, the World Meteorological Organization
(WMO) stated here Monday on the occasion of the World
Meteorological Day.
</P>
<P>
The Convention of the World Meteorological Organization came
into force on March 23, 1950. Each year, WMO celebrates the day by
focusing on a theme of topical or current interest to humankind.
</P>
<P>
The theme of this year's World Meteorological Day, "Weather,
oceans and human activity", has been chosen in accordance with the
United Nations' declaration of 1998 as "The Year of the Oceans".
</P>
<P>
"The relevance of the theme is highlighted by the fact that two
out of three of the world's cities of over 2.5 million inhabitants
are now located in coastal regions and nearly two-thirds of the
world's population live in coastal zones," said Professor Godwin
O.P. Obasi, WMO Secretary-General, in a message marking the World
Meteorological Day.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the world's oceans provide a vital source
of food, energy, water, hydrocarbon and mineral resources but ar
also under growing stress due to the pressures of coastal
development, industrial pollution and overfishing.
</P>
<P>
The 1997/98 El Nino event, which started in the spring of 1997,
has provided additional reaffirmation of the powerful link between
ocean-surface temperatures and the prediction of global weather
conditions several months ahead, WMO said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Reliable weather predictions a few days to a week ahead are
central to the safe and efficient operation of a wide range of
human activities.
</P>
<P>
Driven by the need to develop a comprehensive global ocean
observing system, new industries have evolved to produce
measurement and communication systems. Automated buoys and
satellites are transforming our knowledge of the interactions
between the oceans and the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
These measurements are providing new insights into how winds
generate ocean waves and how, in turn, the waves influence the
transport of energy from the ocean to the atmosphere, WMO said.
</P>
<P>
In polar regions, satellites accurately monitor the extent of
pack ice, its characteristic of thickness and roughness and can
help track icebergs.
</P>
<P>
World activities in controlling the threats of tropical storms,
global warming and rising sea have all confirmed the importance of
the theme, "Weather, oceans and human activity", WMO said.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Ex-fighters Sabotage Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Despite the pledge by the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) for
complete demilitarization at the beginning of this month, remnant
UNITA fighters are still launching armed attacks in some areas.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 UNITA ex-fighters attacked Catata town in Huambo
province last Friday, killing one, and seriously wounding two,
besides destroying the office building of the local government.
</P>
<P>
Bonifacio Muakachandja, head of the town, revealed to the
press Monday that UNITA militia from the area bordering Huambo
and Huila provinces attacked Catata with automatic rifle,
submachine gun and other weapons.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the casualty, they had taken along with them
over 500 head of cattle, said Muakachandja.
</P>
<P>
This is the second attack on Catata town by UNITA militia in
less than one month. The first was in February when over 90 head
of cattle was snatched.
</P>
<P>
Also last Friday, remnant forces of UNITA attacked a traveling
truck in Benguela province, killing 20 passengers on board and
wounding seven others.
</P>
<P>
Higino Carneiro, government spokesman with the Joint Committee
of the Peace Process, noted Monday that the government believed
the incidents were organized and is watching closely at the state
of the development.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United Nations Security Council Monday sent a
letter to Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos, calling on both
the government and UNITA to make continuous efforts to ensure the
complete implementation of the new agenda for the peace process
which was passed on March 6.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Calls for Trial of Bush, Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi National Assembly
Monday called upon the international community to bring to trial
former U.S. President George Bush and current President Bill
Clinton for their crimes against the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi news agency reported that on Monday, the assembly
unanimously approved at an extraordinary session a draft
resolution branding Bush and Clinton, as well as their respective
aides, as war criminals for having committed "immoral and inhuman"
crimes against the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The assembly accused the U.S. government of pursuing to use
force against Iraq, and of "illegally and unilaterally" imposing
air travel ban in northern and southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, U.S., British and French forces declared "no-fly"
zones in southern and northern Iraq to protect Shiite Muslims and
Kurds from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's attacks.
</P>
<P>
Such actions were "diametrically" contrary to the U.N. Charter
and the rules of international law, constituting an aggression
against Iraq's security and territorial integrity, it said.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the assembly held an extraordinary meeting to
discuss the U.S. Senate resolution which demanded the trial of
Saddam Hussein and a number of Iraqi officials before an
international tribunal on charges of committing war crimes.

<HEADLINE> 7 Nuns Abducted in Northwest Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Seven nuns, two Spanish and five
Rwandan nationals, were abducted Sunday night in northwest
Rwanda, reports from Gisenyi Prefecture said.
</P>
<P>
"The abduction took place last night at Kivumu Parish, 10 km
southwest of Gisenyi town," the office of the Episcopal
Conference of Rwanda (CER) told Rwanda News Agency Monday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
It is suspected that this abduction was carried out by the
"Interahamwe" militiamen who have been involved in acts of
insecurity in the northwestern prefectures of Ruhengeri and
Gisenyi.
</P>
<P>
The seven nuns belong to the order of the "Sainte Anne de la
Charite," the CER office said.
</P>
<P>
Since the massive returns of refugees from neighboring
countries starting from late 1996, the militiamen, made up of
former Rwandan government soldiers and the "Interahamwe" forces,
have been targeting army posts, and destroying public
infrastructure such as schools, hospitals and bridges.
</P>
<P>
They are also blamed for the massacres of genocide survivors,
as well as local leaders, the report said.

JERUSALEM, March 23 (Xinhua) -- President of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) Yasser Arafat will attend the meeting of
foreign ministers of the Arab League in Cairo on Tuesday to
address the problems facing the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo meeting will concentrate on the stalled Middle East

official close to Arafat told Xinhua Monday.
</P>
<P>
During the Cairo meeting, Arab foreign ministers will also
affirm their decision of March 1997 to stop all forms of
normalization with Israel because of the Israeli intransigence

Other issues, such as sanctions against Libya, will also be

<HEADLINE> GCC Joint Military Exercises End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Armed forces from the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) states concluded a 10-day joint
military exercises with the aim of further strengthening their
defense cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The GCC joint war game, the sixth since it was launched in
1983, was held in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and was coded
"Peninsula Shield-6", the UAE's official Wam news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It came under a decision by the GCC defense ministers at the
end of last year and was aimed at "improving combat capabilities
of GCC troops...and acquainting the troops with the most advanced
arms," Wam said.
</P>
<P>
The agency gave no further details of the war game, but it has
said that "a number of naval, ground and air forces" and GCC's
collective troops "Peninsula Shield", established in the early
1990, were involved.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a political, economic and defense alliance formed in
1981, groups the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and
Oman.
</P>
<P>
In the past years, the regional bloc's members have sought to
improve their self-defense capabilities through holding military
exercises and purchasing advanced weapons.
</P>
<P>
Last November, the GCC defense ministers approved two military
projects including setting up a common radar network for naval and
air surveillance and an early warning aerial system covering all
the GCC states, as well as raising the strength of the "Peninsula
Shield" from 4,000 to 25,000 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
However, due to their relatively limited human resources, the
GCC states still remain seriously reliant on a large foreign
military presence to protect their security.
</P>
<P>
The United States keeps the largest troops in the oil-rich
Gulf region and it has a permanent deployment of some 20,000
service members and 30 combat and support ships in the area.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Officials of Nairobi University
announced Monday that the university is closed indefinitely
following day-long clashes between students and riot police.
</P>
<P>
According to the announcement, students from Nairobi
University have to leave their campus in the heart of Kenyan
capital before 18:00 (local time) Monday.
</P>
<P>
The local Kenya Television Network (KTN) reported that a
policeman was badly injured after being struck by a rock, two
cars burned and windows of shops and offices near the university
smashed.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of students took to the streets and set up roadblocks
leading to the university at 9.30 am (local time) in protest
against the shrinking education loans.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, after the university increased the prices of
students' meals, the Students' Organization of Nairobi University
sent a note to the university authority, saying that "we shall
not tolerate this kind of uncalled-for exploitation."
</P>
<P>
Students leaders vowed to take action and paralyze the city of
Nairobi if the prices are not reduced.
</P>
<P>
Kipng'etich (only one name), director of the Students' Welfare
Authority in charge of Administration and Accommodation,
justified the new prices which, he said, should be attributed to
the recent tax increments imposed by the Kenyan government.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Shows No Interest in Turkish Initiative on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has voiced its reservations
over a Turkish four-point peace initiative on Iraq, Foreign
Minister of Turkey Ismail Cem said here on Monday at the end of
his three-day visit, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Egypt maintained that the time is "not ripe for fresh
initiatives," Cem told reporters before departure.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that Turkey's initiative is aimed at securing
peace and stability in the Middle East, particularly in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
According to a diplomat in the Turkish embassy in Cairo, the
initiative says Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity
should be guaranteed, Iraq must fully comply with the U.N.
resolutions, the lifting of the U.N. sanctions on Iraq depends on
how Iraq has implemented the resolutions and Iraq's neighboring
countries hold frequent consultations on the issue.
</P>
<P>
"Ankara believes that Baghdad should abide by U.N. Security
Council resolutions in exchange for having the international
sanctions lifted," the Turkish foreign minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent attempt to placate Arab apprehensions over the
growing Turkish-Israeli military links, Cem dismissed criticism
that Turkey has changed its strategy toward Arabs and, instead,
boosted cooperation with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"We have not stopped our support for the Palestinian cause, but
in the same time, we maintain relations with Israel, including
military ties," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Turkey signed two military cooperation agreements with the
Jewish state in 1996, triggering outcry from Arab and other
Islamic countries, which have accused Turkey of betraying the
interests of Muslims.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Cem held talks with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri and Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa on bilateral ties and regional issues.

Democratic Congo, the third biggest country in Africa which is
rich in mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Congo is a potential oil producer as off sea big
oil fields have been found recently in Gabon and Angola, north

<HEADLINE> Vulatovic: Belgrade Still Ready to Settle Kosovo Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Yugoslav Defense Minister
Pavle Vulatovic stressed here Monday that Belgrade was still ready
to negotiate with parties concerned for a peaceful solution to the
Kosovo problem within the framework of the country's constitution.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting with his Greek counterpart Akis
Tsohatzopoulos, Vulatovic said that the Yugoslav government
remained open to the possibility of talks on a resolution of the
Kosovo issue, but always on the basis of the Yugoslav
constitution.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Kosovo was an internal part of Yugoslavia and
problems in the province of course a domestic issue.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged the international community to condemn "acts
of terrorism" in Kosovo recently, stressing that each country
dealt with terrorism with legal means, as was the case with Kosovo
where ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of its nearly 2 million
population and demand the province's independence from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tsohatzopoulos hoped that there would be positive
prospects to follow the Yugoslav government's initiatives and from
Sunday's elections in Kosovo which Vulatovic describes as "a
parody."
</P>
<P>
During their talks, both ministers agreed that security and
stability in the Balkan region required a greater degree of
cooperation between the peoples of the region and were
prerequisites for economic development with the respect of the
European Union's enlargement.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed on the holding of a Balkan Defense Ministers'
meeting sometime this year to discuss regional cooperation and
stability.
</P>
<P>
Vulatovic arrived here on Sunday for an official visit to
Greece.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Government Reiterates its Position on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government reiterated
Monday its position that talks to settle the Cyprus problem should
be carried out by the two community leaders on the basis of
U.N. resolutions and signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, government spokesman
Christos Stylianides said that "the basis of the negotiations,
conducted by the leaders of the two communities, are the high
level agreements and the U.N. resolutions."
</P>
<P>
The two high level agreements reached in 1977 and 1979 between
the Greek and Turkish Cypriot community leaders stipulate that a
bizonal, bicommunal federation will be established on the
island.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides said the Cypriot government has informed the
U.N. Secretary-General's special advisor for Cyprus, diego
Cordovez, and other foreign officials involved in the peace
efforts that it would not accept a change in the procedure of the
talks.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez completed a five-day good offices mission in Cyprus
last week, but failed to persuade the two community leaders to
resume the peace talks which have been stalled since last Summer.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash told the U.N. envoy that
he will no longer take part in negotiations as the leader of his
community and demanded for recognition of his breakaway state,
unilaterally declared in the island's Turkish occupied northern
areas.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides pointed out that President Glafcos Clerides
represents the internationally recognized Cyprus Republic.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome international involvement to bend Turkish
intransigence, so that the process to solve the Cyprus question
begins," he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also announced that the National Council, the
top advisory body for the president on the Cyprus issue, will
convene next week to discuss the latest developments.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in November 1983 a breakaway
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which was only recognized by
Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Pope Winds up Visit to Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Pope John Paul II left Nigerian
capital Abuja Monday afternoon, ending his three-day visit after
calling for peace in this west Africa country.
</P>
<P>
In his farewell speech, the pope repeated his earlier message
of peace, unity and solidarity.
</P>
<P>
While expressing his thanks to his host for the warm
reception, the pope urged the Nigerian government to pursue
national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Responding, General Abacha said his government will continue
to pursue genuine national reconciliation and the common good for
all Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
But he did not touch on the request for the release of the
country's political detainees made by the pope during their
meeting after the pope's arrival in Abuja Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Vatican's chief spokesman, Navano Valls told reporters in
Abuja that a list of 60 detainees have been presented to Abacha
by the Vatican Secretary, Cardinal Sodiana, on behalf of the
pope.
</P>
<P>
"Without entering into the judicial problems that put those
people in jail, we asked on humanitarian grounds for the release
of the 60 people," Valls said.
</P>
<P>
He declined to identify any of the names on the list, but said
General Abacha has accepted in principle to consider the pope's
request.
</P>
<P>
So far no official comment on the issue has been made.
</P>
<P>
Last november, General Abacha promised to release some of the
political detainees on condition their freedom will no longer
threaten national security.
</P>
<P>
But their release was delayed due to a "very serious and
critical breach of security" in the country following the alleged
coup last December, Internal Minister Alhaji Bashir Dalhatu
explained last week.
</P>
<P>
The alleged coup has led to the arrest of Lieutenant-General
Oladipo Diya, the former number two leader, and a number of
senior military and government officials now being tried by a
special military tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Pope John Paul II was seen off at a grand ceremony at the
Abuja International Airport, by the Nigerian head of state,
General Sani Abacha and a host of top government officials as
well as religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Pope arrived in Nigeria Saturday afternoon and was
received at a grand ceremony similar to Monday's seeing-off.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the holy father flew by helicopter to Oba, near
Onitsha in the southern state of Anambra, where he conducted a
special mass to beatify Reverend Father Cyprian Michael Iwene
Tansi, the first Nigerian and west African in the church's
history to be officially proclaimed as "blessed."
</P>
<P>
The Catholic pontiff also met representatives of Nigeria's
Moslem community. Islam is the overwhelming religion in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The pope's second visit to Nigeria since 1982 was closed with
a mass Monday morning at Kubwa, near Abuja, attended by tens of
thousands of Nigerians.

<HEADLINE> Qatar Considers to Cut Oil Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Qatar said Monday it may
announce to cut its oil output in the next few days to coincide
with efforts from other oil producers to rescue sagging oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
The official Qatar News Agency (QNA) monitored here Monday
quoted a source from Qatar's Ministry of Energy and Industry as
saying that Doha "will follow other (oil) producers in this field."
</P>
<P>
"The rate of Qatar's production cut may be announced before
the start of April," the source, whose name was not given, told
the QNA.
</P>
<P>
This follows a decision Sunday by two other OPEC members, Saudi
Arabia and Venezuela, and non-OPEC Mexico to cut their oil outputs
in a bid to prop up crude prices.
</P>
<P>
The oil ministers of Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico agreed
at the end of a two-day secret meeting in Saudi capital Riyadh
Sunday to join forces to try to cut world oil output by up to 2
million barrels per day (bpd) from April 1 until the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
They said in a joint statement that oil producers had so far
agreed to reduce surplus output by 1.1 million bpd and that more
talks would be held in the coming days with OPEC and non-OPEC
producers.
</P>
<P>
If the agreement could be implemented, it would be the first
time that world oil producers had managed to agree to lower oil
output with the aim of increasing prices.
</P>
<P>
Qatar, an important member of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC), said the move was "positive" and it
called on all the world oil-producing countries to follow the
suit.
</P>
<P>
The United Arab Emirates (UAE), whose oil minister currently
assumes the presidency of the OPEC, announced earlier Monday
to trim its oil production by 125,000 bpd starting on April 1.
</P>
<P>
Abu Dhabi said its decision to join Saudi Arabia, Venezuela
and Mexico to cut oil output was aimed at contributing to "balance
oil markets and prop up crude prices which are in a collapse
neither serving interests of oil-producing countries nor of
consuming countries."
</P>
<P>
World oil benchmark Brent crude has fallen from 19 U.S. dollars
a barrel to 13 dollars while the basket of OPEC crudes has crashed
down to 11 dollars since a flood of oversupplies swamped oil
markets due to OPEC's decision last November to raise its
combined output ceiling by 10 percent to 27.5 million bpd this
year.
</P>
<P>
The collapse was compounded by Iraq's return to oil markets
and a decline in crude demand because of a mild winter in
northern hemisphere and Asia's economic turmoil.

<HEADLINE> Security on Top Priority of Kuwait's New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's new government will
continue to put security and independence of the small Gulf
state on top of its priorities, Kuwait's Crown Prince and Prime
Minister Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah said Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said after the first session of the new Cabinet that "as
our beloved country is facing many challenges, the security of the
nation turns a top priority."
</P>
<P>
"Both the nation's internal and external security are our prime
concerns that require dedication of all potentials, massing all
resources, protecting our country's sovereignty and independence
and maintaining the security of our people," the prime minister
said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his new government will employ all means to
foster defensive capabilities, upgrade competence of the armed
forces, defense capabilities and internal security.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Saad further elaborated that "danger still haunts our
borders, as the Iraqi invaders are still detaining hundreds of
our prisoners of war and exploiting the sufferings of their
people to break the isolation imposed on them by the world
community."
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, various international political, economic
and social challenges "dictate on us the need to concentrate on
security, economic reform and comprehensive development."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's new Cabinet, which was sworn in earlier Monday before
Emir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, asserted to press ahead with
the national process of construction and development.
</P>
<P>
After the sworn-in ceremony, the emir called on the new Cabinet
to spare no efforts to "achieve objectives and national
aspirations and continue the march of our dear country's progress,
development and flourishing."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's last Cabinet resigned last Monday over controversies
with the parliament on a no-confidence vote against former
Information Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah over display of
controversial books at an Arab book fair.

<HEADLINE> Former Burundi Soldiers Separated from Refugee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 23 (Xinhua) -- About 30 Burundi refugees
who used to be soldiers have been separated from the civilian
refugees and removed to an independent camp, a statement from
Tanzania's Ministry of Home Affairs said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that those refugees, who were found using
pieces of logs during their physical training, were netted in
January and February and appeared in court.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to handle the refugees who allegedly involved
themselves in military training in the camps because they have
refugee status," the statement said, adding "What we are doing
now is to transfer them to other camps outside this region."
</P>
<P>
These former Burundi soldiers have thus been separated from
the 32,876-man Nduta refugee camp in Kibondo District, Kigoma
Region bordering Burundi, and transferred southeast to the Kigwa
refugee camp in Tabora Region where they are under close
supervision.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
Sadako Ogata said during her visit in the refugee camps in
western Tanzania that her agency would train and equip a
500-strong Tanzanian police force to patrol the camps in order to
maintain the civilian character of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
The move followed allegations that Hutu rebels were using the
camps to launch cross-border attacks against the government of
Burundi's Major Pierre Buyoya.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Tanzania warned Rwanda and Burundi against closing
the camps for their refugees in Tanzania if they continue to
blame Tanzania for supporting the so-called refugees'
crossing-border attacks on them.
</P>
<P>
Segela Nswima, Deputy Minister for Home Affairs said,
Tanzania, fed up with endless accusations by the Rwanda and
Burundi governments, feels too taxing and tough to continue the
task of caring for their refugees.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR statistics show that by the end of last year,
Tanzania harbors 346,703 refugees form Burundi, the Democratic
Republic of Congo, Rwanda and Somalia, with the Burundians
accounting for 266,498.
</P>
<P>
Despite continued civil war in Burundi, there are clear
indications that some 68,000 Burundi refugees returned home in
1997.

<HEADLINE> Israel Rejects U.S. Proposal for Redeployment in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu Monday categorically rejected the United States
proposal for the extent of a second Israeli pullback in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Knesset (parliament) Foreign Affairs and
Defense committee, Netanyahu declared that the decision about
Israel's security must be determined by Israel and not by the
U.S..
</P>
<P>
Reports said that in a bid to advance the stalled
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, the U.S. has called on Israel to
carry out a 13.1 percent second withdrawal in the West Bank linked
to the fulfillment of Palestinian commitments to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said Israel is a tiny country and every piece of
territory is tied to the security, noting that 1 percent of
Israeli redeployment in the West Bank is equal to the area of
Israeli major city of Tel Aviv, some 45 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
And nearly all Israeli cabinet ministers insisted that a
withdrawal from 10 percent of the West Bank is the most that can
be undertaken without endangering security, in marked contrast to
the Palestinians demands for at least 20 percent pullback.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai also warned Monday
that the American proposal will harm Israel's security interests.
</P>
<P>
He said that during his upcoming trip to Washington he will do
all he can to persuade the Americans not to launch its own
initiative.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in an attempt to persuade Israel and the
Palestinians to accept the new initiative, the U.S. Middle East
Peace Envoy Dennis Ross will visit the region later this
week.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Leaves Ghana for Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton wound
up his one-day visit to Ghana and left for Uganda Monday evening
to continue his 12-day six-nation African tour Monday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton closed the reported "successful" visit with a speech
at the Independence Square in central Accra, capital of Ghana,
during which the first U.S. president to the tiny west African
country promised to establish new Africa-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Clinton tried to highlight democracy to the thousands of
jubilant Ghanaians gathering at the square, according to the
British Broadcasting Corporation monitored here.
</P>
<P>
Expressing the U.S. desire to work with Africa for prosperity
by promoting bilateral trade, Clinton said the goal would be
achieved through the development of democracy and peace, as well
as protection of natural environment.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president also sought to build partnership with
Africa, pledging that the U.S. would cooperate with African
countries to fight international crimes and terrorism, drug
trafficking, the degradation of environment and the spread of
diseases like AIDS and malaria.
</P>
<P>
Before the speech, Clinton had a meeting with Ghanaian
President Jerry Rawlings. Details of the talks have not yet been
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's African tour, the first by an incumbent U.S.
president in 20 years, will also bring him to Uganda, Rwanda,
South Africa, Botswana and Senegal.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton will
not visit the genocide memorial erected at Kigali International
Airport in the Rwandan capital, a senior Rwandan government
official involved in the preparation of the visit said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The refusal to visit the monument located within the
perimeter of the airport belittles the meaning of his stop-over
here," the official who preferred not to be named, told Rwanda
News Agency late Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Associations of genocide survivors have also expressed great
disappointment about these changes that occurred in Clinton's
schedule.
</P>
<P>
In the opinion of these associations, Clintons refusal to make
this gesture of solidarity nears betrayal.
</P>
<P>
As Clinton's visit here was announced, a genocide memorial was
built at the airport where he is expected to meet with Rwandan
authorities and genocide survivors.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will have a stopover for several hours at Kigali
airport before he flies to South Africa for his continued African
visit. He will jet in Kigali from Kampala, Uganda.

<HEADLINE> Germany Supports U.N. Peace Efforts on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Germany supported U.N. continuous
efforts toward a comprehensive Cyprus settlement, German special
envoy for Cyprus Detlev Graf zu Rantzau said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The German envoy told reporters after a meeting with President
Glafcos Clerides at the Presidential Palace that the Cypriot
president and himself agreed that the U.N. process on Cyprus must
continue.
</P>
<P>
Graf zu Rantzau, who arrived here Sunday afternoon for a
four-day visit, exchanged views with Clerides on the latest
development of the long-standing Cyprus question.
</P>
<P>
His visit came following a similar visit to the island by the
U.N. Secretary-General's Special Advisor for Cyprus, Diego
Cordovez, who failed to revive the bicommunal peace talks during
his five-day mission.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash refused to attend future
negotiations unless his breakaway state, "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus" unilaterally declared in northern Cyprus in 1983,
is internationally recognized.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his support to the U.N. envoy's mission, Graf zu
Rantzau said "Cordovez should continue his search for a solution
and his efforts to contribute to the solution."
</P>
<P>
The German envoy is expected to cross into the Turkish
Cypriot-controlled northern part of Nicosia to meet with Denktash
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
His visit is part of the intensified international peace
efforts on Cyprus launched after the February's presidential
elections in the Cyprus government-controlled southern part of the
island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a short-lived coup staged by Greek Cypriots seeking union with
Greece.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Concerned About New Air Base in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkey on Monday expressed grave
concern over the possible use of a new air base in Cyprus by the
Greek Air Force.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a weekly news briefing here, Turkish Foreign
Ministry spokesman Necati Utkan said that the situation on the
island will be more complicated if Greek warplanes are deployed
at the Paphos base.
</P>
<P>
The air base, which is located in western Cyprus, has been
completed and will be used by Greek air force planes under
the Greek-Cypriot joint defense pact signed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Utkan said that the Cypriot government should be very cautious
as such a step would bring a negative impact on the stability and
peace of the eastern Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish troops
intervened and took over the northern third of it following an
abortive pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Both Turkey and Greece station large numbers of troops on the
island.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus issue has long been a major stumbling block to the
normalization of relations between Turkey and Greece and to
the stability of the eastern Mediterranean region.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and international community have made great
efforts for the reunification of the island state, but so far no
concrete results have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Egypt-Qatar Ties Go on Right Track: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said Monday that Egypt has no problems with Qatar and their
relations are hopefully going on the right track, the Middle East
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"There is no problem between Egypt and Qatar. I hope things
will go in the right course," Moussa said, "I am confident that
bilateral relations will be maintained in the right track."
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the remarks after a brief summit meeting between
President Hosni Mubarak and visiting Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin
Khalifa al-Thani. The two leaders were expected to hold talks
further on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian and Qatari delegations also held talks on
bilateral relations and the situation in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Qatari Ambassador here Manei Abdel Hadi Al Hajri said Monday
that talks between Mubarak and the Qatari emir will have positive
results that help step up bilateral relations in the political and
economic fields.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari emir was accompanied by a top-ranking delegation,
including Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jabir
al-Thani, Minister of State in the Cabinet Sheikh Mohammad Bin
Khaled al-Thani and Chief of the Emir Cabinet Abdullah Bin Khalifa
Al Atya.
</P>
<P>
His two-day visit was widely viewed as a fence-mending effort
aimed at ending disputes between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The relations of the two Arab countries soured in 1996 when
Qatar alleged Egyptian involvement in a failed coup in Qatar.
</P>
<P>
The ties worsened after Cairo boycotted the Middle East and
North Africa economic conference hosted by Doha last
November. Egypt recalled its ambassador, and sent him back later.
</P>
<P>
A summit meeting mediated by Saudi King Fahd between the Qatari
emir and Mubarak at the end of last year failed to bridge the gap
between the two sides. Qatar later expelled Egyptian laborers.
</P>
<P>
But a thaw seemed to have set in the relations after the two
countries signed an agreement earlier this month to allow Egyptian
workers back to finish their contract terms in Qatar.

<HEADLINE> US Invited to Train Liberian Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria Monday confirmed reports
that the Liberian government has invited the United States to
train its post-war armed forces instead of being done by Nigeria,
saying it is against a peace accord Liberia has signed.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by This Day, one of Nigeria's leading
newspapers, Liberian President Charles Taylor announced last week
the conclusion of plans for the U.S. to train the Armed Forces of
Liberia (AFL).
</P>
<P>
"Liberia will be using bilateral arrangement with countries
like the United States of America to train the new Liberian armed
forces," Taylor was quoted as saying on a live talk show
broadcast from New York.
</P>
<P>
Confirming the report, Nigerian Defense spokesman Col. Godwin
Ugbo told Xinhua that it was not new that Taylor had asked the
U.S. to come for the training.
</P>
<P>
The job, under the Abuja Agreement that brought an end to
Liberia's seven-year civil war last year, should involve the west
African peace-keeping force known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman said, "He (Taylor) is the President of
Liberia, he has the right to do so. But it is against the Abuja
Agreement."
</P>
<P>
Although Taylor said his government would equally rely on
Nigeria for its planned economic turnaround, the rift between him
and Nigeria seems to have been widening in the past months.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, Taylor began to dislike Nigeria
when the Nigerian-led ECOMOG force prevented him from getting
power during the civil war.
</P>
<P>
Since he finally emerged as president in the elections last
July, which was secured by ECOMOG troops, Taylor had been
insisting that ECOMOG should leave Liberia before February 2 this
year, arguing the force's peace keeping has ended.
</P>
<P>
He also banned ECOMOG on using the territory of Liberia to
fight against rebels in neighboring Sierra Leone, where some
junior military officers toppled the elected government in a coup
last May.
</P>
<P>
The warlord-turn president even reportedly sent his former
factional fighters to Sierra Leone to support the military
junta's fight against ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, Liberian police arrested a group of Nigerians,
including three journalists and Col. Ugbo, who were on their way
back from Sierra Leone via Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The action has enraged ECOMOG force Commander Maj.-Gen.
Timothy Shelpidi, who described it as a humiliation to the people
and government of his home country.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian general also accused the Liberian government of
violating the United Nations arms embargo on the country,
questioning how Liberian security forces are armed with new
weapons that are used for war front operations.
</P>
<P>
It is hard to predict where these happenings will lead, and
Col. Ugbo said ECOMOG had concluded plans to move its
headquarters from Monrovia to Freetown, Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Russian Officials on Government Dismissal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Russian foreign policy will
not change after the government's resignation, Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He believed the dismissal of the government has nothing to do
with changes or prospects for changes in Russia's foreign policy,
because "the foreign policy implemented by the Russian Foreign
Ministry has been sanctioned by the president and is being carried
out under his supervision," added Primakov.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of whether he would be dismissed from the current
post he said this is premature, "If somebody wants this (the
minister's dismissal) very much, I will have to disappoint them
for the time-being".
</P>
<P>
Dismissed first deputy prime minister Anatoly Chubais told
reporters Monday that "I'm glad that the president has granted my
request for quitting the government service with which I addressed
him last month."
</P>
<P>
He said that the decision taken by president Boris Yeltsin to
dismiss the government has been prepared long. And he is sure the
government resignation would not alter the course of Russia's
reforms.
</P>
<P>
According to Chubais, he will still remain in the team of
Yeltsin regardless of in which capacity and where he works.
</P>
<P>
Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznyov said at a news briefing after
the government was dismissed that the government made serious
failures in its work.
</P>
<P>
The wage debt to state employees has been accumulating since
the start of 1998 and the obligations that the government
undertook proved unfeasible, Seleznyov noted.
</P>
<P>
The government resignation was long overdue, Communist Party
leader Gennady Zyuganov told a new conference in Simferopol
Monday. "Communists have never trusted this course or this
government or believed that it could manage the tasks it faced",
he said.
</P>
<P>
If the government had not resigned, the trade union and the
left-initiated protest actions scheduled for April 9 would have
its resignation as their main slogan, Zyuganov said.
</P>
<P>
First deputy speaker of the Russian State Duma lower house
Vladimir Ryzhkov predicted on Monday that the Duma might
"theoretically" be dismissed if it failed to approve a new prime
minister three times running.
</P>
<P>
Another report said that Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko on Monday expressed support to the dismissal by Yeltsin
of the Russian government, saying this was "in the right way".
</P>
<P>
But he noted the tendency for bringing the two countries closer
did not exist in the Russian government, which failed to carry out
a single promise on the bilateral union.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan expressed regret to the Russian government's
dismissal, noting that Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin's resignation may produce a negative influence on
relations between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Raps Left in Intervening in Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Monday evening condemned the far-right National Front (FN) as "a
racist and xenophobian party of nature" but accused the left of
being responsible for the rise of the FN in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
In a television speech to intervene in the turmoil in the
election of regional council presidents, Chirac said the left
should not "throw oil on fire."
</P>
<P>
"For a long time, some have never hesitated to play the game of
extreme right. It is because of this that the proportional voting
was adopted... and many seats were given to the left by the
National Front in the last legislative elections which clearly and
deliberately made the republican right fail at the profit of the
(left) majority," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
The late Socialist President Francois Mitterrand introduced the
proportional voting system to the regional elections in order to
let the FN have a foothold in the regions to weaken the mainstream
right.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two rightwing candidates who were elected to the
presidency of the regional councils in Haute Normandie and in
southern Midi-Pyrenees immediately resigned after winning the
election with the votes from FN deputies Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Socialists conquered the council of the key southern region
Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur Monday after FN president Jean-Marie Le
Pen failed to win support from the deputies of the rightwing RPR
and UDP.
</P>
<P>
The election of the Paris council is still going on in the
evening and the left is widely expected to win.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Monday proposed a comprehensive set of measures to
assist the government and people of Sierra Leone in both their
immediate and longer-term needs.
</P>
<P>
In his recent report to the Security Council, the
secretary-general recommended strengthening the office of his
special envoy in Freetown, and the possible deployment of human
rights observers in order to contribute to the restoration of
respect for the rule of law, civil order and human rights in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief is also considering attaching to the office two
civilian police officials to advise the government on police
training and procedures in a democratic society.
</P>
<P>
He recommended the deployment to Sierra Leone of up to 10
United Nations military liaison officers, whose functions would
be: to liaison closely with the Economic Community of West African
States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) and to report on the military
situation in the country; to ascertain the state of and to assist
the finalization of planning by the ECOMOG for future tasks.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the removal of the junta by the action of the ECOMOG
has opened the way for the re-establishment not just of the
legitimate government, but also of civil order, the democratic
process and the beginning of economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
He urged all member states to provide generous assistance to
the ECOMOG to enable it to meet its logistical requirements and to
fulfill its mandate in Sierra Leone.

CAIRO, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Dispelling fears that a planned
national reconciliation conference in Somalia might be scrapped,
the heads of Somalia's two major factions said on Monday they are
pursuing arrangements for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The assurance came in two letters sent by two faction leaders

February 15 to March 31 due to "technical problems," chiefly lack
of fund.
</P>
<P>
In their letters, Aideed and Mahdi stressed their commitment to
the Cairo agreement, which they said has provided a "model
framework" for peace in Somalia, to reach a final settlement in
the famine and war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo Declaration they signed last December calls for a
national reconciliation conference, which will be participated by
all Somali factions, and a federal government.
</P>
<P>
The two Somali faction leaders said that they will soon reach
an agreement to jointly control Mogadishu, the fragmented capital,
and re-open the city's port and harbor.
</P>
<P>
This possible move is viewed as a basic step to materialize
national reconciliation in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has been hit heavily by factional wars since the ouster
of late dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991. More than 300,000
people have died in the war and related famine.

<HEADLINE> "Wide Moves" Expected for Mideast Peace Process: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior Jordanian government
official said here Monday that "wide moves" for the long-stalled
peace process on the Palestinian-Israeli track would be seen in
two weeks due to the efforts exerted by the United States.
</P>
<P>
"The American officials promised to present a series of ideas
in this respect that will be put forward soon" and the region
would witness "wide moves" in this regard in the coming two
weeks, said Deputy Prime Minister for Development Affairs and
Minister of Foreign Affairs Jawad Anani during a weekly press
conference.
</P>
<P>
The ideas will be publicized when U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright or U.S. peace envoy to the region Dennis Ross
pays a visit to the region, said Anani who accompanied King
Hussein during his visit to the U.S. starting on March 12 but
returned a few days ago prior to the king's return.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Ross' upcoming regional visit, Anani said that "I
think Ross can submit specific proposals that can meet the demands
of all the concerned parties."
</P>
<P>
Semi-official Jordan Times reported Monday that the U.S. wants
Israel to cede 13.1 percent of the West Bank in return for steps
by the Palestinian National Authority to stop terrorist
activities in Israel.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli Prime Minister has said that Israel alone would
determine how much land to hand over to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Anani criticized the existence of "double standard,"
referring to the U.S.' appeasement of Israel's defiance of
already signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
"There are very clear resolutions and agreements signed by the
Israeli side with the Palestinians, particularly the Hebron
accord, but these decisions are not respected," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab citizens would see such matters as a double standard
policy," Anani added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations have been stalled
for more than a year due to the Israeli construction of Jewish
settlements in Arab East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese President to Visit Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Capping a marked thaw in
Cairo-Khartoum ties over the past few weeks, Sudanese President
Omar al-Bashir was expected to visit Cairo shortly, Sudanese
foreign minister said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mustafa Osman Ismail told Egypt's Middle East News Agency after
meeting Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid here that
the date of Bashir's visit had not been fixed. "When the time is
ripe, such a visit would take place," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese foreign minister, who was in Cairo to chair
meetings of the 109th session of the Arab League foreign
ministers' council due to open Tuesday, dismissed reports that
Cairo was putting preconditions to restoring normal ties with
Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
He said Egypt was "by far the country most capable of playing
an effective role in preserving Sudan's unity and political
stability."
</P>
<P>
Ismail met with his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa later in
the day and was expected to held more talks with Moussa during his
stay in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said after the meeting that the two countries were keen
on maintaining a momentum in a bid to place bilateral relations
back on the right track.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors were at odds over a border dispute and had
traded accusations of harboring militants and oppositions, but
there were signs of a tentative thaw in relations.
</P>
<P>
An Egyptian delegation headed by Prime Minister Kamal
el-Ganzouri recently went to Khartoum to convey condolences over
the death of Sudanese First Vice President al-Zubeir Mohammed
Salih in a plane crash.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Time Not Ripe for Talks With Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States has said the time
is not ripe for a direct dialog with Iraq, Jordanian Foreign
Minister Jawad Anani said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Washington does not think it is the proper time to hold dialog
with Iraq at present as proposed by Jordanian King Hussein, Anani
told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. said such a dialog would only be possible after
Iraq has fully implemented the United Nations Security Council
resolutions concerned.
</P>
<P>
Hussein explained his proposal to U.S. President Bill Clinton
during their meeting last Thursday, Anani, who accompanied the
king during the trip, said.
</P>
<P>
The king put forward his proposal during a visit to Oman, the
United Arab Emirates and Egypt before he left for the U.S. on
March 12.
</P>
<P>
Jordan would like to see the U.S. and Iraq to open a dialog in
a bid to resolve their differences, put an end to the tensions in
bilateral relations, and save Jordan from being stuck in crisis,
the Jordanian minister said.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Hussein and Clinton discussed the
implementation of the U.N. resolutions by Iraq and the issue of
U.N. economic sanctions imposed on Iraq after its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990, Anani said.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions will not be lifted until Iraq is in full
compliance with the U.N. resolutions, he said, adding that this is
the spirit of the resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and the U.S. have been hostile to each other since the
U.S.-led coalition drove Iraqi forces out of Kuwait in the 1991
Gulf War. The U.S. accuses Iraq of not complying with the U.N.
resolutions, while Baghdad blames Washington for prolonging the
crippling economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the U.S. threatened to attack Iraq due to its
refusal to grant full access to U.N. arms inspectors to its
presidential sites suspected of hiding weapons of mass
destruction. A successful mediation by the U.N. chief Kofi Annan
defused the crisis.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Urges France's Political Modernization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- After the election of regional
council presidents plunged France's political life into chaos,
President Jacques Chirac has urged the modernization of the
country's politics.
</P>
<P>
Chirac is clearly aiming to scrap the proportional system in
regional elections introduced by former President Francois
Mitterrand, who allowed the far-right National Front to get a
foothold in the regional councils to weaken the mainstream
rightwing parties.
</P>
<P>
The legislative election of France keeps the run-off voting
system which sees two top political leaders rival in one
constituency and leads to the production of a strong parliamentary
majority countered by a minority.
</P>
<P>
Under the proportional voting system, both the leftwing and the
rightwing can only win a relative majority in most regional
councils while the National Front can always play the role of
kingmaker in the election of council presidents.
</P>
<P>
As a result of this, some rightwing deputies have to solicit
support from the far right deputies to be elected to the
presidency of the councils.

<HEADLINE> Baghdad Holds Mass Funeral for Dead Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A mass funeral was held in
Baghdad Tuesday for 23 Iraqi children who died due to the
shortages of food and medicine caused by the seven-year-old
U.N. economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Participants set out from al-Shaheed Adnan Khairalla Square in
downtown Baghdad and headed toward the five-star Rasheed Hotel,
where the visiting Chairman of the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) on disarmament in Iraq, Richard Butler, and most foreign
correspondents stay.
</P>
<P>
They shouted slogans denouncing the U.S. for what they said
perpetrating crime against the Iraqis and deliberately prolonging
the embargo on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Iraqi Children Fund Society Sultan al-Shawi
said that "the American administration is to blame for the
genocide faced by Iraqis and children in particular because of
its insistence to prolong the embargo."
</P>
<P>
"There has been an increase in children's diseases including
cancer and malformation as a result of the use of banned weapons
like depleted uranium by the United States during its aggression
against Iraq," said al-Shawi.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions imposed on Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait
in 1990 cannot be lifted unless UNSCOM verifies that Iraq is free
of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics released by the Iraqi Health
Ministry, mortality rate of Iraqi children under five last
February amounted to 6,623, in comparison with 356 cases
registered in February 1989.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1.3 million Iraqi children have died due to the
shortages of food and medicine since the economic sanctions.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Presidential Advisor Osama
al-Baz said on Tuesday the problems between Egypt and Qatar are
"fleeting clouds" and the bilateral relations have been normalized.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Qatar have solved their problems, al-Baz told
reporters after a meeting between Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak held three rounds of talks on Monday and Tuesday with
Hamad, who arrived here on Monday for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
"What happened during a certain time (between the two
countries) was not Egypt's choice," he said, adding that Mubarak
has been working to maintain the best relations with all Arab
brothers.
</P>
<P>
The visit of the Qatari emir is widely viewed as part of
fence-mending efforts aimed at ending disputes between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The relations of the two Arab countries soured in 1996 when
Qatar alleged Egyptian involvement in a failed coup in Qatar.
</P>
<P>
The ties worsened after Cairo boycotted the Middle East and
North Africa economic conference hosted by Doha last November and
Qatar's expulsion of Egyptian workers.
</P>
<P>
A summit meeting mediated by Saudi King Fahd between Mubarak
and Hamad at the end of last year failed to bridge the gap between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
A thaw set in the relations after the two countries signed an
agreement earlier this month to allow Egyptian workers back to
finish their contract terms in Qatar.

announced on Tuesday that a joint seminar will be held
here on Mmarch 30-31, 1998 to discuss ways to curb anarchic conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing, Zidane Meriboute, head of the
ICRC mission to OAU, said that the two-day seminar will discuss
''implementation of international humanitarian law in the context
of anarchic conflicts.''

The seminar will explore the relevance of humanitarian
approaches on the limits applicable to anarchic conflicts, as in
Somalia, Sierra Leone, Liberia before the elections and former
Zaire, said Meriboute.
</P>
<P>
According to him, anarchic conflicts occur where the
government has not effective control over its territory and
population.
</P>
<P>
Senior scholars of Africa and Europe as well as ambassadors to
OAU will bring forth their experiences to the seminar on various
subjects such as ''history and nature of anarchic conflicts'' and
''the management and resolution of anarchic conflicts''.
</P>
<P>
Meriboute said that the subject for this year's seminar has been
taken up in consideration of the topicality to give solutions to
such conflicts in Africa.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian government has
adopted a national strategy for the country's accession to the
European Union, said Foreign Minister Nadezhda Mihailova.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, which runs until 2001, Bulgaria must
successfully complete preparations for and start negotiations on
EU accession, must meet the Maastricht convergence criteria for
economic and monetary union and must cement its position as a
European infrastructure center.
</P>
<P>
The government will try this year to meet the EU membership
criteria which will allow the European Commission to assess
positively Bulgaria's preparation for accession to the EU.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said he will present the strategy to the
European Commission in late March and announced that a joint
standing committee be set up to forward information to the
Commission about the rate of reform.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Justice Minister Vassil Gotsev said the government
also approved a program for the alignment of Bulgarian law to
European legislation.
</P>
<P>
Under this plan, lists will be drawn up of all laws that need
to be aligned and of those that will be enacted as part of the
process of meeting EU membership criteria.
</P>
<P>
The justice minister said legislation regulating the domestic
market is the one that most needs harmonization.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: UK Exports Suffer as Pound Soars to 12-year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The British Pound climbed to its
strongest level in nine years on Monday, increasing pressure on
exporters.
</P>
<P>
The pound ended at 107.9, up 0.5 on the currency index,
matching its peak in January 1989. Against the German Mark, it
gained a pfennig to rise above DM3.06, close to last summer's peak.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that it was fueled by a rally in the price of
oil and the surprise sacking of the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
Traders reacted quickly to news of the weekend deal between
Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Venezuela designed to cut oil production
by two million barrels a day from the beginning of next month.
</P>
<P>
The Pound was helped too by the initial hit on the German Mark
caused by the political changes in Russia. Germany is one of
Russia's biggest trading partners and German banks among the
biggest lenders, so German markets are more sensitive to events in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts also argue that the main reason for the
renewed strength of Sterling on Monday was the fact that there was
no more attractive currency around in the currency markets.
</P>
<P>
Former Chancellor Kenneth Clarke warned that the level of the
pound was damaging exports and that industry was facing recession.
</P>
<P>
Ian Peters, deputy director of the British Chambers of

Trade figures due on Thursday are widely expected to show
another one billion pound-plus (1.6 billion U.S. dollars) monthly
shortfall of exports compared to imports in January.
</P>
<P>
The underlying trend in visible trade has been deteriorating
for the past few months, with export volumes declining while
import volumes continue to grow strongly.

But Margaret Beckett, president of the Board of Trade, insisted
the Government's policy was correct and warned that the former

Chancellor Gordon Brown said at the EU financial ministers
meeting at the weekend that he was concerned about the impact of
the strong Pound on exporters, but short-term worries could not
override the long-term goal of stability.
</P>
<P>
Like most analysts in London, the Treasury expects the pound to
fall in value at some stage, but this might not happen until the
summer or later.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are some major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Russian President Boris Yeltsin astonished Russia by
dismissing his entire Cabinet, including a loyal aide, Prime
Minister Viktor Chenomyrdin. There were many theories about why
Yeltsin took the action, but the simplest seemed to be that there
had been much talks of a successor during his recent illness and
he did not like suggestions that he had lost any of his authority.
</P>
<P>
-- The California Supreme Court ruled that the Boy Scouts of
America could exclude gay people, agnostics and atheists from its
ranks because it is a private membership group not covered by the
state's civil rights law.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- On the first stop of a six-nation, 11-day African tour, U.S.
President Bill Clinton came to the capital of the first sub-Sahara
nation to win independence and predicted that a region long marked
by disease, dissension and dependency is poised for "the beginning
of a new African renaissance."
</P>
<P>
-- The Movie "Titanic" won a record-tying 11 Oscars at the 70th
Annual Academy Awards, including Best Director. That ties it with
1959's "Ben Hur" as the most honored film in Oscar history.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The decision by OPEC and other oil producers to cut output
may not be enough to trim the glut of world supplies. Economists
also doubt the move will damp the U.S. economy. But the deal won
some support from other producers and sent oil prices soaring.
Crude oil for May delivery rose 1.90 U.S. dollars a barrel, or 13
percent to 16.51 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
-- The Justice Department asked a federal court to block
Lockheed's 8.3 billion U..S. dollars purchase of Northrop on
antitrust grounds, and the companies vowed to fight to protect
their deal.

<P>
BANKOK, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodian government
guaranteed the security of Prince Norodom Ranariddh after he
returned home, visiting Cambodian Co-defense Minister Tea Banh
said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After meeting Thai Deputy Foreign Minister Sukhumbhand
Paribatra, Tea Banh told reporters that his government has been
well prepared for the prince's return.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Thai deputy foreign minister said that the tense
situation in Cambodia will be eased and will not become an

Earlier last Saturday, Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk granted
pardon to his son, Prince Ranariddh.

Ranariddh was sentenced to 35 years of imprisonment and a
54-million U.S. dollar fine by a military court in his absence.
</P>
<P>
Later, Ranariddh, who is now in Bangkok, said he will return
home on March 30 and participate in the elections scheduled for
July 26.
</P>
<P>
According to Tea Banh, Cambodia's Second Prime Minister Hun Sen
will pay a visit to Thailand, during which the two neighbors will
discuss bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Tea Banh's current visit to Bangkok was for the preparation of
the upcoming summit in early May.

<HEADLINE> Tuberculosis Epidemic Threats China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Ministry of Health
reported today that tuberculosis (TB) kills over 230,000 Chinese
annually, with the figure surpassing the cumulative death toll for
all other infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
Some six million people in China suffer from pulmonary
tuberculosis, of them 1.5 million being highly infectious,
according to a ministry report released on the World TB Day.
</P>
<P>
"China continues to face the threat of a serious TB epidemic,
because half of the population has not yet taken preventive
measures," the report says.
</P>
<P>
Scientists warn that TB, a disease which has plagued mankind
for several millenia, is in the process of threatening human
beings across the globe due to frequent population migrations and
the emergence of multiple drug resistant strains of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization recommends an effective
treatment known as DOTS, or "directly observed treatment, short
course". The effective treatment program, which requires TB
patients to receive daily drug dosages over a six-month period,
offers a high cure rate.
</P>
<P>
Local TB control agencies and professionals have been urged to
adopt DOTS on a wide scale and to strengthen the registration of
TB sufferers, according to Wan Liya, a ministry official in charge
of TB control.
</P>
<P>
The ministry plans to control the incidence rate of pulmonary
tuberculosis at seven people per 10,000 by the year 2000, said Wan,
adding that the average cure rate will rise to 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
The world's largest TB control project currently involves over
560 million people in 13 Chinese provinces and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
"A total of 840,000 TB sufferers have been treated and the
average cure rate has remained above 90 percent since the
initiation of the project in 1992," Wan said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Embarks on School-Leaver Skills Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has set
aside 12 million U.S.Dollars to establish 20 vocational training
centres countrywide within the next 12 months targeted for
absorbing 3,000 school leavers every year, a cabinet minister
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Higher Education and Technology Ignatius Chombo
told the Zimbabwe News Agency, ''The ministry has already
received the seed money of 200 million Zimbabwean dollars for the
next 12 months so that we can start.''
</P>
<P>
Courses to be offered include building, wood technology, metal
fabrication, clothing technology, agriculture, electrical and
mechanical engineering, or any other skills identified by local
communities, the minsiter said.
</P>
<P>
Chombo said that the idea to start vocational training centres
was mooted two years ago because of the increasing number of
students leaving school and unable to be absorbed at existing
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's education is churning out over 300,000 school
leavers every year a bulk of which cannot get places at tertiary
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The vocational training centres would be open to all people
aged 15 years and above, the minister said.

Three people on the ground were killed and dozens of others

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa
Osman Ismail said Tuesday Khartoum and Cairo have overcome
difficulties in their relations and entered into a new phase of
better cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"The two countries surmounted difficult points in all files and
started the stage of joint cooperation in security, political and
economic domains," Ismail said following talks with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt and Sudan want to complete examining and tackling
various files in order to bring bilateral relations back to normal
and even better," Ismail said.
</P>
<P>
The two Afro-Arab neighbors were at odds over a border dispute
and had traded accusations of harboring militants and oppositions,
but there have been signs of a tentative thaw in relations.
</P>
<P>
Ismail expressed confidence that a border dispute over the
Halaib triangle in the Red Sea area would be solved.
</P>
<P>
"Due to the nature of bilateral relations and security between
the two countries, the Egyptian role is very important for
achieving Sudan's unity and security," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese foreign minister conveyed to Mubarak a message
from Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, which deals with bilateral
relations and their future prospects as well as the regional and
international situation especially in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
He said that Bashir in his message expressed thanks to Mubarak
for sending an Egyptian high-level delegation led by Prime
Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri to Khartoum last month to convey
condolences over the death of Sudanese First Vice President
El-Zubeir Mohammed Saleh in a plane crash.
</P>
<P>
Capping a marked thaw in Cairo-Khartoum ties over the past few
weeks, Bashir was expected to visit Cairo shortly, according to
Ismail after meeting Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid and Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa here Monday.

<HEADLINE> South Korean President Denies Opposition Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 24 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-Jung
Tuesday refuted accusations by the opposition Grand National Party
(GNP) that he is exploiting an investigation into an alleged smear
campaign against him during the presidential race last December.
</P>
<P>
"I am not mobilizing any investigation authority to make
political use of the case," Kim said, dismissing the opposition's
accusation that he is using the scandal to conduct an
investigation into the former ruling party.
</P>
<P>
Kim's statement came one day after the prosecution authorities
said they will expand the investigation into an alleged plot by
the Agency for National Security Planning (ANSP) and then ruling
politicians.
</P>
<P>
The move followed a suicide attempt by former ANSP director
Kwon Young-Hae last Saturday. Kwon is charged with masterminding
the smear campaign to slander Kim as a pro-North politician.
</P>
<P>
Kim said he learned some of the developments in the case by
reading newspapers and he is not receiving reports from either the
prosecution or ANSP Director Lee Jong-Chan.
</P>
<P>
"Frankly speaking, I'm preoccupied with economic problems all day
and I'm not interested in anything else,'' Kim said.
</P>
<P>
President Kim said the fate of Kwon and other suspects in the case
will be decided in accordance with relevant authorities' findings.
</P>
<P>
Local media said some GNP legislators were involved in the
smear conspiracy by ANSP officials, who made use of a letter sent
to Kim Dae-Jung by one of his former advisors who defected to the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Earlier this month, the GNP, which holds 163 seats of the

political retaliation by the the ruling camp agains the GNP as it
came just one day after the assembly refused to approve President
Kim's appointment of Kim Jong-Pil as prime minister.

<HEADLINE> AL Urges Future Arab Steps to Save Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary General
Esmat Abdul-Meguid Tuesday urged the Arab world to take the
initiative to confront obstacles in the Mideast peace process set
by Israel, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the 109th AL Council here,
Abdul-Meguid expressed his pessimism over the prospects of
rescuing the stalled Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
"I fear Israel would take over the Mideast file and fashion the
future of the region according to its own interests that run
counter to the other parties," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Arab world to consider future steps to remain
in the "circle of action rather than reaction," adding that an
Israeli-imposed status quo should be avoided.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Abdul-Meguid expressed belief that the Arab world
still has "some bargaining chips" that it could use to serve real
peace and challenge Israeli defiance and intransigence.
</P>
<P>
"Given the policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, we must urgently handle the peace process with sagacity
and firmness," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel, he said, has allocated 200 million U.S. dollars in its
1998 budget to the construction of Jewish settlements in the
occupied East Jerusalem, its suburbs and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League has asked the U.S., Europe and other donor
countries to halt their financial and economic assistance that
Israel injects into its settlement activities in the Palestinian
area and the Golan Heights, seized by Israel in 1967 from Syria.
</P>
<P>
On the ongoing U.S. efforts to reactivate the peace process,
Abdul-Meguid said that "meetings or talks, whether in Washington
or elsewhere, are useless unless the key issues are settled."
</P>
<P>
He defined the key issues as Israeli troops redeployment in the
West Bank, a halt to settlement activities and the lifting of the
closure on Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The league has also urged the U.N. to protect Palestinian
people's inalienable human rights and work for the release of all
Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Arab-Israeli conflicts and the Mideast peace process will
top the two-day meeting, attended by foreign ministers of 16 Arab
countries under the chairmanship of Sudanese Foreign Minister
Mustafa Osman Ismail.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat,
who arrived here earlier in the day, also addressed the opening
session.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Arafat called for an Arab summit to promote Arab
solidarity and face up to Israeli intransigence and preserve the
peace march.

FUZHOU, March 24 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province held
a commemorative meeting today in Fuzhou, the provincial capital,
to mark the 60th anniversary of the northern campaign of the
Fujian troops serving the New Fourth Army during the War of
Resistance Against Japan (1937-1945).

during the eight-year war, and killed or captured 471,000 enemy
soldiers.

<HEADLINE> China Establishes First Large Foreign Trade Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- China's first large foreign
trade group -- China General Technology (Group) Holding, Ltd.
(GENERTEC) -- was inaugurated in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The group is a solely state-owned company composed of the China
National Technical Import-Export Corp, the Machinery Import and
Export Corp, the Instruments Import-Export Corp. and the
Corporation for Overseas Economic Cooperation, all affiliated to
the Chinese Ministry for Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
(MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
The four companies are wholly-owned subsidiaries of the GENERTEC, a
legal independent entity.
</P>
<P>
The four companies have histories of several decades and have
made great contributions to China's foreign trade by absorbing and
importing thousands of advanced technological items and complete
sets of equipment.
</P>
<P>
They have total assets of 159 billion yuan, an aggregate
business turnover of 65 billion yuan and a total foreign trade
volume of 6.8 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The GENERTEC will manage the group's assets and will administer
investments, major shareholding positions, equity participation
and other forms of capital management, according to Chairman Tong
Changyin.
</P>
<P>
He added that the four subsidiaries will continue to focus on
foreign trade activities.
</P>
<P>
Tong said the GENERTEC will bring the integrated strength of the
group into full play in order to ensure its ultimate
transformation into a large multinational foreign trade
conglomerate focusing on industry, technology, finance and
information services.
</P>
<P>
The group's goal is to realize total assets of 21 billion
yuan, a business turnover of 100 billion yuan and a foreign trade
volume of 9.5 billion US dollars by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia, Yemen to Resume Border Demarcation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Negotiations on border
demarcations between Saudi Arabia and Yemen are expected to resume
soon, diplomatic sources in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, were quoted by
Kuwait News Agency as indicating Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic sources expressed the belief following a two-day
visit by the Secretary General of the Yemeni Presidency Brigadier
Abdullah Al-Busheiri to the Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Riyadh, Al-Busheiri held talks with Saudi
officials and delivered a letter from Yemeni President Ali
Abdullah Saleh to Saudi King Fahd Bin Abdul Aziz over the
demarcation of the borders.
</P>
<P>
Al-Busheiri's visit set the basis for the resumption of
negotiations over the demarcations, although the outcome of his
talks with Saudi officials were not disclosed, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni president's message he delivered, the second of
its kind in less than four months, was aimed at paving the way for
resuming border negotiations suspended late last year after a
clash between the Yemeni patrol troops and Saudi border guards
killing two Saudis and a Yemeni.
</P>
<P>
Saleh proposed late 1997 to postpone the negotiations "if
there was no desire to resolve the problem" following the
incident.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have been striving to settle their
long-standing border disputes that may eliminate the last obstacle
hindering further improvement of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Both sides had been optimistic last year towards a quick
solution of their border dispute following the exchange of points
of view over the proposal of King Fahd which he presented last
July and was responded by President Saleh in the same month.
</P>
<P>
But in the wake of the border incident late last year,
Yemeni vice President Abdo Rabo Mansour Hadi said his country
was ready "to seek arbitration if the impasse in border
negotiations continues".
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed a memorandum of understanding in
1995, calling for the formation of six sub-committees to
facilitate the demarcation process.

<HEADLINE> New Marketing Campaign for Hong Kong Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A campaign to create a new
image for Hong Kong and build it as the most popular tourism
destination was previewed at a special ceremony here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new campaign, which was conceived by the Hong Kong Tourist
Association (HKTA) in conjunction with its travel industry, offers
an exciting, fresh new outlook for Hong Kong, emphasizing its
energy, vibrancy and creative, cutting-edge aspects and will be
launched worldwide from April this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the HKTA, within a few weeks, the campaign's
meaningful theme line and distinctive visual will be appearing in
Asian regional publications.
</P>
<P>
By middle of 1998, the campaign will be at full throttle in
selected national and regional markets throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a series of publications including Consumer
Literature, Overseas Consumer Literature and Local Consumer
Literature will be produced by the HKTA under the banner of "We
Are Hong Kong City of Life" .
</P>
<P>
The Consumer Literature will reflects dynamic, energetic,
fast-paced Hong Kong and its contemporary and creative manner.
</P>
<P>
Overseas Consumer Literature aims at attracting people to Hong
Kong while Local Consumer Literature specially for visitors who
are already in Hong Kong aims to bring the Hong Kong experience
alive.
</P>
<P>
Amy Chan, executive director of the Hong Kong Tourist
Association, said that the launch of this new global marketing
campaign is of special significance, adding that it is her wish
that it is a campaign that involves the entire Hong Kong
community.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the downturn in regional economies in the second
half of 1997 affected Hong Kong's tourism, so the industry's need
for a new pro-active marketing campaign was pressing.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is Hong Kong's leading service industry, and in terms
of foreign exchange earnings and employment, its importance cannot
be underestimated, she stressed.

JAKARTA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian rupiah Tuesday
rose 350 points against the U.S. dollar due to what many believe
as positive reaction to Bank Indonesia's decision to raise its
certificate (SBI) interest rate.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah closed at 8,650/8,750 against the U.S. dollar on
spot market, or 350 points higher compared with that on Monday
which closed at 9,000/9,200 per dollar, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
Another cause for the stronger of rupiah was the positive
reaction from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to the
increase of the SBI rate. The IMF said Monday it welcomed the
action of Bank Indonesia to stabilize the rupiah and curb
inflation.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has lost about 70 percent of its value against the

<HEADLINE> Jordan Accepts Israeli "Clarification" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has accepted an Israeli
apology and clarification on a statement that it still wants to
kill an Hamas leader after a botched assassination attempt, a
local newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Jordan Times quoted Foreign Minister Jawad
Anani as saying that Jordan thought the clarification by Israeli
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon is an "answer" to its censure.
</P>
<P>
Sharon has sent an "apology letter" to Jordan's Crown Prince
Hassan explaining that what he said was "misunderstood" and he did
not mean to threaten the sovereignty, integrity of Jordan and its
people.
</P>
<P>
"As long as Sharon says that his statements were misunderstood
...and he respects Jordan's sovereignty and does not intend to
attack any Jordanian citizen...we in Jordan, for our own
diplomatic services, say that this is an answer (to our demands),"
said Anani.
</P>
<P>
The incident started when Sharon told Israeli TV Channel Two
on March 14 that Israel had informed Jordan that it still intended
"to finish the job" of killing Khalid Mashaal, a leader of the
Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas operating in Jordan, but not on
Jordanian soil.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has strongly denied that it had any knowledge of
anything prior to Sharon's statement on TV.
</P>
<P>
Anani added that it was "up to the Jordanian government" to
decide on whether the whole text of Sharon's apology letter would
be published.
</P>
<P>
Mashaal survived an attempt on his life on September 23,
1997, in which two Israeli secret agents were arrested after
injecting poison into his left ear in front of his Amman office.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian-Israeli relations sharply deteriorated over the
failed murder. King Hussein immediately suspended cooperation in
security matters with Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The fiasco also contributed to Israeli intelligence service
Mossad chief Danny Yatom's resignation last month after a series
of failed operations against Hamas, Iran and Hezbollah (Party of
God) of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Jordan and Israel seemed to begin warming
up recently as they exchanged high-level visits and signed a
number of agreements to boost bilateral trade earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
But this development was suddenly interrupted by Sharon's
remarks which were made only four days after Hassan visited Tel
Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is the second Arab country that signed a peace treaty
with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Stronger on Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
higher Tuesday thanks to a hefty rise in the price of gold, ending
the session in Sydney more than 0.5 U.S. cent stronger.
</P>
<P>
The currency ended at 67.03 U.S. cents, up from 66.36
previously.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in more than a week that the currency had
closed above 67 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
"We saw the strength early...when the gold price rose by more
than six US dollars in New York and there was a half a (US) cent
rally in the Australian dollar," said Stuart Moore, foreign
exchange manager of Australia's St George Bank.
</P>
<P>
The surge in gold, along with silver, was triggered by concern
that Russian President Boris Yeltsin's dismissal of his entire
cabinet could delay Russian shipments of precious metals.
</P>
<P>
Moore said after the Australian dollar's initial sharp rise,
the unit settled into a tight band of 66.90-67.10 U.S. cents for
the rest of the session.
</P>
<P>
"We had importers taking profits above 67 U.S. cents so the
currency struggled through the day," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished the local session at 87.10 yen
from 86.67 yen previously, and at 1.2244 marks from 1.2144 marks.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: An Important Step to Stablize Kosovo Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Serbian government and the
Albanian ethnic group in Kosovo reached a consensus Monday on
implementing an agreement to normalize the education system for
local Albanians.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also signed a document specifying concrete
measures for the implementation in Pristina, the provincial
capital of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Observers here viewed the step as one of great importance for
the stablization of situation in Kosovo, which has worsened since
the end of February.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo, a province of the Republic of Serbia, is bordered by
Albania. With an area of 10,000 square kilometers, the province
has a population of about two million, 90 percent of whom are
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Incited by separatists, the Albanians in Kosovo have long
sought to establish a "Kosovo Republic" and merge into Albania.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic dismissed the local
parliament and government in Kosovo, which fueled the racial
antagonism in the area. In the same year, Albanian students and
teachers went on strike to protest the government's refusal to
stop using the unified curriculum specified by Serbian authorities.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate the students' return to school, the current
president of Yugoslavia and the then Serbian president Milosevic
signed an agreement with Ibrahim Rugova, a leader of the Albanian
ethnic group, in September 1996, on the normalization of education
for the Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
A commission with three representatives from each side was set
up to implement the agreement. But the two sides never agreed on
how to implement their agreement.
</P>
<P>
The representatives of the Serbian government stressed an
acceptance of the unified curriculum by local Albanian teachers
and students, while representatives of local Albanians pressed for
an unconditional re-opening of school.
</P>
<P>
The new document signed Monday specified nine measures on the
implementation of the 1996 agreement, including a date set for the
re-opening of school with courses taught in the Albanian language
by Albanian teachers.
</P>
<P>
Ratomir Vico, a member of the Serbian government delegation,
told the press after the signing ceremony that the early return of
Albanian students and teachers to school signifies an important
step toward the normalization of education for Albanians in Kosovo
and the stablization of situation in the province.
</P>
<P>
Fehmi Agani, a representative of the local Albanians, said it
is of vital importance for the two sides to work out detailed
measures on the implementation of the 1996 agreement. He hoped the
measures would be enacted.
</P>
<P>
In London, Robin Cook, British foreign secretary and current
president of the European Union Council of Foreign Ministers,
expressed EU's welcome to the consensus reached by the Serbian
government and local Albanians on measures for implementing the
agreement on the normalization of the education of Albanians in
Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Normal Sino-Russian Ties to Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Wholesale changes in the Russian
cabinet will have no impact on Sino-Russian ties, according to
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhu Bangzao.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remark during today's regularly scheduled press
conference in response to a question concerning the impact
President Boris Yeltsin's decision to fire the Russian cabinet
will have on Sino-Russian ties.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Yeltsin's move was strictly an internal
affair, and noted that China maintains friendly neighborly
relations with Russia and sincerely hopes it will witness economic
development and social stability.
</P>
<P>
The strategic Sino-Russian cooperative partnership is based on
a solid foundation and is a mature state-to-state relationship.
"The stable and healthy development of the partnership is in the
fundamental interests of the two nations and their people, and is
highly beneficial to ensuring regional stability and world peace,"
said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason to believe that the relationship will be
affected by cabinet reshuffling," said Zhu.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Says No Decision on Troop Redeployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Israel has not yet made its
final decision on the percentage of troop redeployment in the
West Bank, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Israel Radio, Netanyahu stressed that
Israel did not say that it is ready to accept a U.S. proposal on
Israeli troop redeployment and that only Israel can determine its
security needs.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made these remarks before U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan's visit to Israel Tuesday afternoon and U.S. peace
envoy Dennis Ross's return to the region on Thursday. This policy
towards the peace process seems setting Israel on a colliding
course with the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Washington has reportedly proposed Israel return 13.1 percent
area in the West Bank to the Palestinian National Authority under
Yasser Arafat in an effort to revive the collapsing Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel, however, dismissed the idea, citing security concerns
as a justification of its self-styled second stage redeployment
from a maximum of 9 percent of West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The peace process has been deadlocked for more than a year,
mainly because of Israel's Jewish settlement expansion and the
dispute over extant of its withdrawal from West Bank. Virtually no
agreements has been reached on Israel's troop redeployment,
opening of Gaza airport and sea port, construction of a safe
passage linking West Bank and Gaza Strip and a host of other
issues.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said on Monday that he was not seeking any conflict
with the U.S., but the decision on redeployment has to be made By
Israel, not the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The same day Ross said in Washington that he was determined to
break the deadlock in the peace process, and that during his
visit to the region he will "finalize" American ideas for
rekindling the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ross said his visit to the region will be "critical."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Israel has stated that it wants to withdraw
from south Lebanon under the U.N. Security Council resolution 425
passed in 1978, provided that security arrangements be made with
Beirut to ensure Israel's northern border security.
</P>
<P>
In order to seek U.S. support on this issue, Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai is scheduled to fly to Washington on Wednesday
for talks with U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
He is reportedly to ask the U.S. to help Israel maintain its
qualitative military edge through U.S. funding a third Arrow
battery, as part of the Israeli-U.S. Arrow missile defense
program.

<HEADLINE> Britons Urged to Stay Calm After Iraqi Anthrax Plot Revealed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The British government urged
people to remain calm on Tuesday after it confirmed intelligence
warnings of a possible Iraqi anthrax attack.
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe that anthrax has been brought in Britain,
there's no evidence for it, and we're not expecting any
imminently," Junior Home Office Minister Mike O'Brian said.
</P>
<P>
"We're vigilant, but there's certainly no grounds for
scaremongering over this, or for frightening people," he added.
</P>
<P>
British intelligence uncovered evidence of a plot by Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein to smuggle anthrax in bottles disguised
as duty-free goods, such as perfume sprays, cosmetics and alcohol,
into Britain if military strikes were launched against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Home Office issued a warning last Wednesday, saying, "Iraq
may launch chemical and biological attack using material disguised
as harmless fluids. Could officers therefore be alert for any
items which might contain harmful substances."
</P>
<P>
The warning was based on information from a source believed to
have access to intelligence in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
"There is a possibility, but not a likelihood of Saddam
Hussein creating an incident," O'Brian said, in an attempt to
reassure the public after the alert warning was revealed in the
media.
</P>
<P>
Anthrax is a deadly bacteria that normally strikes animals,
but the organism can be used as a weapon by releasing its spores
into the air.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad backed down on the issue of U.N. weapon inspections in
key sites on February 22 to avert imminent military strikes by the
United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Iraq on Tuesday denied it planned to send anthrax to
Britain, with a spokesman dismissing the reports as "silly and
baseless".

relations and help promote the friendly relations and cooperation
between China and Africa.
</P>

Sino-Guinean relations and the fruitful results of the cooperation
in political, economic and other fields since the two countries
established diplomatic ties 39 years ago.

to Guinea is within its ability and limited, and it is sincere and
without any preconditions.

friendly relations and cooperation with the developing countries
constitutes an important part of China's foreign policy.

cooperation with Guinea and all African countries," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Facing similar tasks in building the country and striving for
favorable international environment, Tang said, the Chinese
government is willing to work together with the Guinean government
to explore new modes of cooperation in establishing a new type of
relationship of long-term, stability and all-round cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Kamara commented that Guinean-Chinese cooperation has been
effective and satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said President Lansana Conte wanted him to
bring the message that Guinea will continue to pursue the "one
China" policy and firmly support China's reunification cause.
</P>
<P>
He added that Guinea has rich natural resources and immense
economic potential. He said Guinea hopes the Chinese government
encourages Chinese businesses to jointly develop their resources,
eventually making Guinea a showcase of China-Africa cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Kamara passed to Tang a letter written by President Conte to
Chinese President Jiang Zemin. He also invited Tang to visit his
country.
</P>
<P>
Kamara arrived here this morning for an official visit at
Tang's invitation.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Balayogi Elected Speaker of India's Lower House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- G. M. C. Balayogi, a Telugu
Dasam Party (TDP) nominee backed by the Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP), was elected speaker of the just constituted 12th Lower
House of Parliament by a voice vote here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Balayogi, who is the first Dalit (lower caste in India) to
become a speaker, defeated P. A. Sangma, former speaker and joint
candidate of the Congress and the United Front as well as other
opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
The TDP broke away from the United Front Monday and changed its
stand from equi-distance from the BJP and the Congress into
support to the BJP. In exchange, the BJP offered the speakership
to the party.
</P>
<P>
With the election of speaker, the ruling BJP and its allies
emerged victorious in the first trial of strength on the floor of
the House ahead of the confidence vote slated for Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 47-year-old Balayogi from Andhra Pradesh in southern India
was first elected to the Lower House in 1991 as a TDP candidate.
He lost in the 1996 general elections and regained his seat in the
just concluded general elections.
</P>
<P>
Born on October 1, 1951, he is a post-graduate in arts and law,
beginning his political life in 1982.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement Tuesday, leaders of the Congress, United
Front and some other parties charged the BJP with using the office
of speaker as a "bargaining counter" for boosting the strength of
the minority ruling formation on the eve of the confidence vote.

<HEADLINE> Australians to Begin Digital TV, Radio Broadcasting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Australians television viewers
could enjoy cinema-quality viewing as early as January 1, 2001 and
they have to buy digital television sets in the next decade as
current analogue technology will be phased out by December 2008.
</P>
<P>
Australian Communications Minister Richard Alston announced
Tuesday night that free-to-air television networks in Australia
will be required to begin broadcasting in digital television from
January 1, 2001, probably starting with a couple of hours a day in
prime time.
</P>
<P>
The start up of digital radio services will be allowed in
Australia in 2001, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Alston said television would be simulcast in digital and
analogue until 2008.
</P>
<P>
"That will enable a smooth transition path. It will enable
consumers to set their own pace of migrating to digital services
and it will provide an opportunity for the technology to be put in
place," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The digital services, including television and radio
broadcasting, are capable of offering high definition viewing and
also compact disc-quality sound, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Alston said seven megahertz of spectrum would be available free
to each free-to-air television networks until 2008.
</P>
<P>
Alston said the changeover was expected to cost the networks
330 million U.S. dollars, while advertising revenue would be
fragmented, and younger people were switching to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Under the policy announced by the minister, the television
networks could not engage in multi-channeling (using the space for
one digital channel to provide three analogue channels) or
providing pay television, but would be able to use any unused part
of their allocated spectrum with data casting.
</P>
<P>
Data casting is transmission of data, for example weather
reports, news, stock prices, entertainment guides, or newspaper
classified advertising.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Called on U.S. to Lift Embargo Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States displayed
hypocrisy in supporting Africa's economic recovery while it
continued its immoral and inhumane embargo against Cuba, the
South African Friends of Cuba Society said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued ahead of U.S. President Bill Clinton's
visit to South Africa, the Society said the international
community rejected the American notion that Cuba be starved into
submission just because it had a different political system.
</P>
<P>
The Society said it is ironic that Clinton will come to Africa
to discuss U.S. support for Africa's economic recovery when one
of the most critical factors impending economic recovery in Cuba
is America's own economic blockade against the small country.
</P>
<P>
While President Clinton traveled through Africa, the South
African public must be aware of the incredible hardship that he
continued to impose on the people of Cuba, the Society noted.
</P>
<P>
It said part of Clinton's agenda in Africa are discussions
around the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, but Cuba has for
years been calling for peaceful co-existence with the U.S. and
for the economic blockade to be lifted.
</P>
<P>
"We find it very difficult to understand" for this, the
Society stressed in its statement.
</P>
<P>
Describing the blockade as illegal, the Society called on the
Clinton administration to lift it and to recognise its own
hypocrisy as a source of the humanitarian crisis in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The international community through the United Nations had for
many years rejected the idea that Cuba should be starved into
submission just because it had a different political system to
many Western countries, the society said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Province Steps Up Efforts to Increase Farmers' Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hubei Province is
taking steps to raise farmers' income at a time when farmers
enjoyed good harvests but had less income in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the province reported a record grain harvest, but the
growth rate of the farmers' income was 5.6 percentages less than
that in 1995. Last year, it had another all-time high grain
harvest of 26.3 billion kilograms, however, farmers' income from
grain production fell 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Ni Dexin, Director of the provincial Agriculture Department
attributed the decline to the shift of the seller's market for
farm produce to a buyer's one, and also to the inadaptability of
poor quality products to the diversified market demands.
</P>
<P>
So, this year the province will increase some 660,000 hectares
of quality rice in a bid to yield 10 billion kilograms of quality
rice.
</P>
<P>
It is making efforts to improve the farm produce distribution
system and the grain market pricing system, aiming to protect
farmers' rights and interests. Projects are already underway to
establish grain retail markets in major cities to solve the
contradiction of small production and big market, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
Focus is also placed on agricultural infrastructure
improvement, and a strategy to promote agriculture relying on
science and education.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of farmers in the province have signed the
30-year land-use extension contract, and the rest will sign it
this year, showing their confidence in agricultural
production.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Projects Inflation Higher in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Tuesday the country's inflation is
projected to be at seven to eight percent in 1998 as opposed to
2.7 percent in 1997 and 3.5 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who announced a further downward revision of gross
domestic product growth to between 2.0 and 3.0 percent from the
earlier forecast range of 4.0 to 5.0 percent, told Parliament that
unemployment is expected to increase to 3.5 percent this year
compared with 2.7 percent last year and 2.8 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, Anwar, who is also finance minister, announced that
current account deficit would narrow to 0.5 percent of gross
national product in 1998 from 5.1 percent in both 1997 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
He said the country is now expected to enjoy a huge trade
surplus of 27.6 billion ringgit (7.586 billion U.S. dollars) this
year compared with only 424 million ringgit (116.547 million U.S.
dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Money supply growth was projected at 14.7 percent at the end of
February, 1998, but will slow down to 12 percent for the year, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He assured that there will be no use of public funds to
bail-out troubled firms.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the economic performance in 1997, Anwar said the per
capita income declined by 2.9 percent to 4,316 U.S. dollars from
4,446 U.S. dollars in 1996 as a result of the depreciation of the
ringgit.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia's international reserves increased to 59.1
billion ringgit (21.7 billion U.S. dollars) at the end of 1997,
sufficient to finance 3.4 months of retained imports.
</P>
<P>
He said the national debt remained manageable in 1997 despite
being affected by a depreciation in the value of the ringgit, with
the nation's external debt only increasing by 9.5 percent in U.S.
dollar terms.
</P>
<P>
The private sector external debt increased by 82.6 percent,
totaling 61.1 billion ringgit (15.794 billion U.S. dollars) while
that of the federal government only increased by 23.7 percent,
totaling 13 billion ringgit (3.573 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
He said the debt service ratio, however, declined to 5.1
percent as opposed to 5.7 percent in 1996 due to stronger
expansion in exports of goods and services.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Population Meeting Opens in Bangkok </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A high-level United Nations
meeting on population was inaugurated here Tuesday, which aimed to
review the progress in the implementation of the program of action
adopted at the International Conference on Population and
Development (ICPD) four years ago.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, jointly organized by the U.N. Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and the United Nations
Population Fund (UNFPA), will also review the implementation of
the Bali Declaration on Population and Sustainable Development,
adopted by Asia-Pacific countries in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Bali Declaration, which is rooted in the context of
sustainable development, and the ICPD program of action, which
places individuals at the center of development, both underscore
the need for programs to respect individual rights and respond to
individual needs.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, ESCAP Executive Secretary Adrianus
Mooy highlighted the progress made by ESCAP members in raising
income level, improving education, expanding transport and
communication systems, improving health and combating diseases.
</P>
<P>
However, he said problems such as persistent poverty, high
unemployment, lower status of women, high levels of drop-out at
the primary school level, and high rates of mortality during
infancy, childhood and among women of reproductive age, still
exist in the region.
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned the current economic turmoil in East and
Southeast Asia, saying it poses additional questions for the
region's economies to deal with.
</P>
<P>
"Under this scenario, it would be prudent and realistic to
ascertain whether and how the fragile economies of the ESCAP
region can meet the demand for investment in the social sector,
including population," Mooy said.
</P>
<P>
UNFPA Executive Director Nafis Sadik also delivered a speech at
the meeting, which focused on women's rights and their
reproductive health.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand Bhichai Rattakul
informed Thailand's achievements in population control, which made
the country's rapid economic growth possible.
</P>
<P>
More than 150 participants from both the government and
non-government organizations from more than 30 countries of the
Asia-Pacific region attended the meeting, which will end on

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- India accounts for the highest
percentage of tuberculosis (TB) which kills an estimated three
million people every year the world over, said the World Health
Organization (WHO) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a report released on the occasion of world TB day, WHO said
that the epidemic is growing larger and more dangerous, with eight
million people developing the disease each year. TB kills more
adults each year than AIDS, malaria and diarrhea diseases put
together and one-third of the world's population is infected with
TB bacterium.
</P>
<P>
The looming threat of TB in India can be curtailed through
effective implementation of the directly observed treatment
short-course. Under this strategy, health workers monitor whether
a patient has taken medicines described by WHO throughout the
period of treatment.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Military Urges Fighting Fundamentalism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's powerful generals will
reinforce its call on the coalition government to take tough
measures against the rapidly expanding Islamic fundamentalism in
the secular country.
</P>
<P>
The Daily News newspaper said Tuesday that the top brass are
expected to present a state security report to the National
Security Council which is to hold a meeting on March 27.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the generals' report stresses that the
coalition government headed by Mesut Yilmaz has not taken
sufficient steps in battling Islamic fundamentalism which "poses a
direct threat to the republic."
</P>
<P>
"No serious initiative has been taken at the ministries,
police force or local administrations against fundamentalist
cadres," it said, adding that some ministries were reluctant to
sack those officials with Islamic tendency.
</P>
<P>
The report suggests that the government remove all those police
officers, governors and low-level administrative officials who
have links with fundamentalist groups.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it points out that the newly established Virtue
Party (FP) is the continuation of the former Welfare Party (RP),
which was forced to close early this year for its anti-secular
color.
</P>
<P>
It asks the government to take measures in this respect since
the existence of the FP in the parliament shows that the former
RP has not been closed.
</P>
<P>
The military, which always regards itself as a protector of
Turkey's secular system, also stresses that "scarf dressing" must
be banned in governmental institutions and various schools.
</P>
<P>
"Scarf incidents are not innocent demonstrations but rehearsal
for a fundamentalist attempt to attain power," it says.
</P>
<P>
The generals led by Chief of General Staff Ismail Hakki
Karadayi were greatly annoyed by Yilmaz's recent remarks that the
army has not been given the assignment to fight Islamic
fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
In a strongly-worded statement, the military warned that the
Turkish Armed Force will continue to carry out its duty of
defending the country's secular system.
</P>
<P>
Backing down before the military pressure, Yilmaz softened his
stance by saying that the army has the constitutional right and
duty to guarantee the country's democracy and secularism.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts noted that Yilmaz, who himself is a pro-Western
politician, was trying to distance the powerful military from
politics in order not to anger his own party's conservative
factions.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Auditing Bodies Work Harder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The auditing departments of
Shanghai have increased supervisory efforts at state-owned
enterprises and government institutions.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, auditors checked on 1,900 units and had 87 special
projects. Thanks to these efforts, the state collected 632 million
yuan more in levies, saved 200 million yuan in government
allocations or subsidies, recovered 26 million yuan used for
illicit purposes, got 5.3 million in fines, and reduced government
investment in infrastructure by 483 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Last year, auditors brought in 1.35 billion yuan in government
revenues. The director of the Municipal Auditing Bureau, Jin
Zengde, says that local auditing departments will closely follow
these steps.
</P>
<P>
Their work will focus on the efficient use of government funds
and avoiding financial hazards, and greater attention will be paid
to joint stock companies, enterprises that are allowed to operate
in the red with government permission, and the utilization of
foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
Special audits will be done on infrastructure projects, real
estate projects, social security funds, and investment in housing
and water conservation projects.

<HEADLINE> Zambia, Zimbabwe to Sign Trade Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A Zimbabwean delegation is
expected to arrive in Zambia soon to discuss and sign a bilateral
trade agreement, which has been on drawing board for almost three
years now.
</P>
<P>
Progress on the proposed trade agreement has stalled for a
long time due to some quarters of the Zambian business community
objecting to certain issues in the agreement, Financial Mail
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The weekly newspaper said Zambia hopes to increase its exports
to the neighboring country to cut down the huge trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, Zambian Commerce, Trade and Industry Minister
Enock Kavindele said that his country would by last week sign a
long-expected trade agreement with the Southern African Customs
Union (SACU).
</P>
<P>
However, last week no agreement was signed. So far, some
observers are of the view that Zambia has failed to sign any
trade agreement with SACU or Zimbabwe and yet the country is
adversely affected by imports from these countries.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Zambian currency, Kwacha, is experiencing
drastic pressure due to lack of adequate foreign currency, a
situation which has adversely caused price increases of some
imported goods including fuel.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Arrives in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat arrived here Tuesday on a few hours'
visit to Egypt, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will have talks with President Hosni Mubarak on means to
rescue the stalled peace process and then address the opening
session of the 109th Arab League Council meeting, due to open
later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's speech is expected to deal with the risks of Israel's
continued refusal of all proposed initiatives attempting to
salvage the stalled Mideast peace process, said Nabil Abu Rdeina,
advisor to the Palestinian leader.
</P>
<P>
The address is also expected to stress on the necessity of
promoting Arab solidarity in a bid to face up to Israeli
intransigence and preserve the peace march, Abu Rdeina added.
</P>
<P>
The Arab-Israeli conflict will top the 22-item agenda of the
two-day meeting to be attended by foreign ministers of the Arab
League member states.
</P>
<P>
The Mubarak-Arafat talks will center around the outcome of the
latest Egyptian and Palestinian contacts with the EU and U.S. over
the new U.S. initiative to break the peace stalemate, according to
Palestinian Ambassador Zohdi Kedra.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to advance the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks, the U.S. has called on Israel to carry out a 13.1 percent
second withdrawal in the West Bank linked to the fulfillment of
Palestinian commitments to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Both Palestinians and Israelis have expressed reservations over
the plan. Israel said it can afford to pull out from no more than
10 percent of the territories while the PNA demands at least 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
Before heading to Cairo, Arafat called on U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan at the guest House in Gaza, bidding him a
farewell before wrapping up a two-day visit to the Palestinian
self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Anna is expected to head to Israel later Tuesday on the sixth
stop of his Mideast tour which had already taken him to Jordan, Egypt,
Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in an attempt to persuade Israel and the
Palestinians to accept the new initiative, the U.S. Middle East
Peace Envoy Dennis Ross will visit the region later this
week.

</P>
<P>
In a television speech Monday evening, Chirac said he cannot

<HEADLINE> Australian Economic Growth to Be Slower Than Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Australia's economic growth is
expected to ease below the Australian federal Treasury forecast as
Asia's economic crisis led to a worsening trade position,
Australia's chief commodities forecaster said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth is assumed to increase from 2.7 percent in the
financial year of 1996-1997 to 3.7 percent in the current
financial year of 1997-1998, before easing to 3 percent in
1998-1999, the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource
Economics (ABARE) said.
</P>
<P>
This is below the Treasury's mid-year review of budget
forecasts which predicted that growth of 3.75 percent in 1997-1998
would slow to 3.25 percent in 1998-1999 as the fallout from Asia's
economic crisis takes hold in Australia.
</P>
<P>
ABARE said net Australian exports are to make a negative
contribution to growth due to higher imports and lower exports as
a result of the economic slowdown in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Australia's current account deficit is forecast to worsen,
mainly reflecting the worsening trade account and the effect on
Australia's foreign debt of a weaker Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
"In the short term, growth in domestic demand is assumed to
strengthen further in response to low interest rates," ABARE said
in its quarterly Commodities Overview.
</P>
<P>
"The current account deficit is expected to increase, mainly
reflecting a worsening trade account and the revaluation effect on
Australia's foreign debt of a weaker Australian exchange rate
against the U.S. dollar," it said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Formulates Economic Indigenization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government Tuesday
released a policy framework for indigenization of the economy to
enable the economically marginalized black majority to enter the
mainstream economy.
</P>
<P>
The document says the foreign component of the private sector
dominates the country's economy. Foreign ownership is over 80
percent.
</P>
<P>
The year 2020 should see Zimbabwe emerge as a strong and
prosperous nation, with a democratic socio-economic system based
on a high competitive and self sustained industrialized economy,
it says.
</P>
<P>
Indigenization of the economy aims at developing a
democratized and competitive domestic private sector which will
be the engine of economic growth and development.
</P>
<P>
The main component parts of the strategy for indigenization of
the economy include creating an enabling macro-economic
environment, increasing indigenous private investment in the
economy, industrialization of the economy, land redistribution,
skills development, mobilization of financial resources and
review of laws that constrain indigenization of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The document says privatization of state enterprises through
employee stock ownership schemes, strategic partnerships and
indigenous institutions, as well as commercialization of state
enterprises will help reduce the budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
It stresses skills development is crucial for the development
of a competitive and self sustaining domestic private sector
which is the engine of economic growth and development.
</P>
<P>
Skills development is also crucial for industrialization of
the economy as well as for creating tangible wealth and
employment. Zimbabwe particularly requires entrepreneurial
skills, technological know-hows and economic development
management skills.
</P>
<P>
The increase of indigenous private investment in the economy
will be achieved through the establishment of new indigenous
enterprises and new joint ventures, buying of shares in the
existing non indigenous companies by indigenous people,
privatization of state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The government will establish national investment trust as a
vehicle for indigenous population participation in privatization
of state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
At the breakfast briefing, Minister of State in the
President's Office for State Enterprises and indigenization C.G.
Msipa told reporters, "indigenization is not about redistribution
but it is about expansion of the economy and broadening of the
ownership of the country's resources."
</P>
<P>
"If properly implemented, it should lead to prosperity and
harmony throughout the country," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's gross domestic
product (GDP) growth for 1998 has been further revised downward to
between 2 and 3 percent, Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar
Ibrahim announced in the parliament Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This was the second revision to the country's GDP growth
announced by Anwar, who is also finance minister, since last
October when he presented the 1998 budget in which the economic
growth was forecast at 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
He revised the forecast downward to a 4- to 5-percent range on
December 5 last year when he announced several measures to
stimulate the economy affected by the currency crisis in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia and some other economies in the region have been
seriously affected by the financial crisis since the middle of
last year.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said, "The crisis continues to be felt and while the
financial markets in a number of countries have begun to
stabilize, the regional situation remains difficult."
</P>
<P>
He said the prolonged crisis has had a serious impact on the
economies and financial systems of the region.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister said that for the purpose of analyzing
economic development this year, a growth rate of 2.5 percent will
be utilized.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's economic growth was strong in 1997 with the GDP
registering a 7.8-percent increase, Anwar announced.

XI'AN, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Though the output of cigarets
declined by 0.96 percent, the profits generated from the "small
chimney" rose by 4.55 percent in 1997, according to a national
cigarets production meeting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the sale and stockpile of cigarets dropped by 0.38

limiting cigar production had paid off, the meeting held recently
in Baoji City, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, was told.

The campaign has also effectively curbed the over supply of
up market cigars, making the product varieties more rational.

In a bid to improve the management, 22 producers have been
granted ISO9000 standard of the International Standardization
Organization. There are over 100 cigar makers in China.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Interbank Interest Rates Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The predicted hike in interbank
interest rates in Kenya took place last week with interbank rates
rising to the 20-22 percent bracket from 15 percent the previous
week, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The increase was due to the banks' building-up of cash
positions ahead of the tax payments, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's Treasury Bill (TB) auction resulted in a net-out of
1.4 billion Shillings (some 23.3 million U.S. Dollars) and as a
result the money market is expected to tighten further this week,
it said.
</P>
<P>
The market might tighten even further given the selling of the
second floating rate bond issue this year at the primary market,
it warned.
</P>
<P>
The high positive rates on TBs have made the Commercial Paper
market unattractive to the issuer since the cost of raising these
funds is on the rise, not to mention the administrative costs
involved.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there was remarked improvement at the bond market
with turnover up by 38 percent from the previous week to a new
year high of 546 million Shillings (9.1 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The offer for the five billion Shilling (some 83.3 million
dollars) one year floating rate bond second issue remains open
this week to close on Friday, said the report.
</P>
<P>
According to market sources, there may be limited foreign
investor participation citing concerns of the runaway budget
deficit and also that investor confidence is at its lowest.
</P>
<P>
Against expectations, the Nairobi Stock Exchange Index
reversed its two week decline Friday by closing 11.79 points
higher, recouping some of last week's losses.
</P>
<P>
Turnover, however was down 11.85 percent from the previous
week but volume traded was up 45 percent as investors continued
to reduce their holding in overvalued stock.
</P>
<P>
The Shilling firmed against the Dollar for the fourth
consecutive week and gained against all the listed currencies in
the cross currency calculations except vis-a-vis the Pound
Sterling.

<HEADLINE> China, World Bank to Build Wind Power Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- China plans to co-operate with
the World Bank in building four large wind power projects in the
first half of 1999 with a combined generating capacity of 190,000
KW.
</P>
<P>
They will be built at Huiteng Gele in the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, Zhangbei in Hebei Province, Pingtan in Fujian
Province, and on Shanghai's Chongming Island.
</P>
<P>
Total cost is 240 million U.S. dollars, part of it coming from
a 60-million-U.S. dollar loan from the World Bank, according to a
State Economic and Trade Commission official.
</P>
<P>
Specialists say that China has 1.6 billion kw of potential wind
power resources and that 250 million kw of that is exploitable. It
expects to increase its capacity from less than 100,000 kw to
400,000 kw by the end of the century and that will benefit
eight million people who still have no electricity.
</P>
<P>
China's two current development projects are called "Chengfeng"
and "Guangming". The former is for producing large-scale
wind-driven generating projects, and the latter is for providing
electricity for remote mountain areas, islands and pastoral
areas.

<HEADLINE> Yangtze River Dikes Collapse in Jiangxi Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Yangtze River collapsed in
16 places in Jiujiang City of east China's Jiangxi Province and
the total length of dike collapse reached 5.9 kilometers,
according to latest information from the city.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Xuanfa, head of the Jiujiang Water Resources and
Electricity Bureau, said the river water in the collapsed places
has moved several dozen meters closer to the highway and is only
eight meters away from the residents buildings in some areas.
</P>
<P>
Although the city has raised 10 million yuan (1.2 million US
dollars) in emergency fund to reinforce the dykes, but it still
lacks a lot more to meet the safety demands.
</P>
<P>
The official said if the situation becomes deteriorated, the
safety of one fifth of the city's population, one fourth of
farmlands and the Beijing-Kowloon Railway will be threatened.
</P>
<P>
Cheng attributed the continued dike collapse to abnormal
weather from last winter to this spring. The water level of the
part of river in Jiujiang City went up four meters over last
year's same period as a result of constant rainfalls in the past
few months.
</P>
<P>
Weather forecast made by Jiujiang meterological department
indicated that the rainfalls will increase by 30 percent in the
April-June period.
</P>
<P>
The part of Yangtze River in Jiujiang is 195 kilometers.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Launches New Plan to Fight AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government has set aside 80 million Rand (16 million U.S.
Dollars) to mount a new strategy to combat AIDS, the Star daily
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The strategy will be led by an inter-ministerial committee
chaired by Vice President Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for "visible" commitment and leadership from
government at national, provincial and local levels.
</P>
<P>
It also provides for participation by business and labor,
community-based and non-governmental organizations, the media,
education and health sectors, religious groups, traditional
leaders, arts, culture, sports and recreation, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The plan is to be backed up by research and development
functions. In addition, a commitment will be made for South
Africa to collaborate with strategic alliance partners in the
quest for a vaccine that can cure AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Envisaged legislation will prohibit discrimination against
people living with AIDS by outlawing pre-employment HIV-testing
in the public and private sectors. It will prohibit employees
being dismissed because of their HIV status.
</P>
<P>
A worker may only be dismissed when he or she fails to perform
the assigned tasks and not due to HIV/AIDS status, the paper
quoted authors of the plan as saying.
</P>
<P>
The draft plan, which will be discussed and finalized at a
national AIDS conference scheduled for August this year, calls
for the government to raise public awareness about HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The plan also stipulates obligations of the president and
parliamentarians to promote AIDS awareness.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the president should address the
country on the current status of HIV/AIDS during his
state-of-the-nation address.
</P>
<P>
HIV (human immuno-deficiency virus) infection, which leads to
fatal epidemic of AIDS, is spreading rapidly in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about three million South Africans are
HIV-positive and at least 1,500 people are being infected with
the virus every day.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Cuts Back on Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- In a desperate bid to forestall
the downward slide in the oil price in the world market, Nigeria
has followed suit with other oil producing countries to cut down
its daily production of about two million barrels by 125,000
barrels.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government hopes that this cut, along with other
concerted actions by other oil producers, would help bring
orderliness to the oil market.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Ministry of Petroleum Resources
Monday night said Nigeria welcomed the announcement by oil
producing countries that concerted efforts were being taken to
mitigate the impact of the present over-supply on oil prices.
</P>
<P>
According to industry sources, the action of Nigeria followed
a recent meeting attended by Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico,
the first where members and non-members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed to work in concert to
restore stability of the oil market.
</P>
<P>
OPEC increased the production quotas of its members beginning
this year. But demand has since been weak mainly due to the warm
winter in the northern hemisphere and the effect of the financial
crisis in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The falling oil price got down to a new low last weekend, and
oil producing countries had to revise downward their budgets
based on oil income.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is Africa's largest oil producer and a member of OPEC.
The government produced its budget this year based on a 17 U.S.
Dollars per barrel oil price. But the price of Nigeria oil went
down to near 11 dollars last week, putting big pressure on the
government.

<HEADLINE> Northeastern China Moving Heavily Polluting Factories </HEADLINE>

SHENYANG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- As many as 176 heavily polluting
factories have been moved from the downtown area of Shenyang, the
capital of China's Liaoning Province, according to the municipal
environmental protection bureau.
</P>
<P>
The old industrial base does not have a very sensible
industrial layout, something that causes health and other problems
for the city's residents.
</P>
<P>
Early in 1985, the municipal government began removing the
worst polluters from the downtown area and said that they needed
renovating to prevent any more problems with pollution.
</P>
<P>
In the past, people who lived near the Shenyang Adhesive Tape
Manufacturing Factory, a heavy polluter, couldn't open the windows
of their apartments because of the thick black dust from the
factory.
</P>
<P>
After it was moved to the suburbs, the factory used the chance
to make itself into a cleaner plant, and now it's not uncommon to
see workers walking about the workshops in white uniforms.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Visit to Boost S. Africa-U.S. Trade: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has expressed
optimism about the coming visit by the United States President
Bill Clinton, saying the visit will promote trade between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Sowetan Tuesday quoted Thuthu Vilakazi, acting
deputy director-general of Foreign Affairs Department, as saying
that Clinton's visit would strengthen direct foreign investment
and further expose South African products to the American market.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is scheduled to arrive in Cape Town, South Africa
Thursday. He is the first U.S. president to call on Africa since
former U.S. President Jimmy Carter tacked a visit to Liberia and
Nigeria in 1978.
</P>
<P>
The visit, which aimed at "showcasing what South Africa has
achieved since 1994", could strengthen what had been achieved
through the bi-national commission headed by South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki and his American counterpart Al Gore,
Vilakazi said.
</P>
<P>
The year 1994 witnessed the abolition of Apartheid and the
first non-racial elections in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
It was important that Clinton's trip came after the recent
passing of the American Economic Growth Act, which allowed the
importation of agricultural products to the massive U.S. market,
Vilakazi said.
</P>
<P>
However, she indicated that South Africa would express its
concern about the conditions included in the agreement to allow
such access - without adopting a confrontational stance.
</P>
<P>
She also confirmed that the implications of Health Minister
Nkosazana Zuma's proposed Control of Medicines and Related
Substances Amendment Bill on U.S. investment in the South African
pharmaceutical industry would be discussed.
</P>
<P>
Currently the U.S. is opposed to the bill, which allows for
the parallel importation of cheaper drugs, claiming that it
mitigates against substainable investment in the South African
pharmaceutical industry.
</P>
<P>
Vilakazi said there would be bilateral discussions between
South African cabinet ministers and their American counterparts.

<HEADLINE> Australian Export Earnings Set to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Australia's earnings from
commodity exports over the next few years are expected to rise
despite the growing fallout from the Asian financial crisis, the
Australian government's chief commodity forecaster said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the uncertainties in Asian markets, the value of
Australian commodity exports is forecast to rise by 5.2 percent to
64 billion Australian dollars (42 billion U.S. dollars) in (the
current financial year of) 1997-98 and to stay around that level
in 1998-99," the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource
Economics (ABARE) said in its latest March-quarter forecasts.
</P>
<P>
The forecasts follow previous estimates of 63.3 billion
Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Economic growth forecasts remain low for a number of key Asian
markets and this is likely to continue to adversely affect
Australian exports to the region, in particular exports of live
cattle and fresh fruit and to a lesser extent dairy products,
beef, wool and cotton," ABARE said.
</P>
<P>
"However, the effect of a decline in export demand in South
East Asia is expected to be largely offset by currency movements,
which have improved the competitive position of Australian exports
relative to North American supplies," it said.
</P>
<P>
ABARE expected saleyard prices for beef to jump six percent to
average 184 Australian cents a kilogram in 1998-1999 and wool
prices to lift four percent to about 705 Australian cents a clean
kilogram.
</P>
<P>
But despite the yearly rise, the wool price is well down on the
previous forecast and the live cattle trade is tipped to remain in
the doldrums.
</P>
<P>
ABARE's latest forecasts of a 190 Australian dollars per ton
pool return for Australian standard white wheat and 18.5 million
tons in production for 1997-1998 were unchanged on the previous
estimates.
</P>
<P>
But the bureau predicted the return would drop to 185
Australian dollars the following year, almost three percent lower
than in 1997-1998.
</P>
<P>
Wheat export earnings were anticipated to drop to 2.6 billion
Australian dollars in 1998-1999 from 3.2 billion Australian
dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Although some strengthening in world prices is expected, weaker
demand in key Asian markets for Australian wheat means that the
overall returns for Australian wheat exports are forecast to be
lower in 1998-1999, it said.
</P>
<P>
The area sown to winter crops in Australia was put at about 18
million hectares in 1998-1999, a significant rise on the previous
forecasts attributed to the worse outlook for wool in the year
ahead.
</P>
<P>
ABARE assessed the outlook for the major bulk minerals, iron
ore and coal, as mixed this year.
</P>
<P>
The combination of possible further central bank sales, falling
Asian demand and low world inflation was expected to keep gold
prices low.
</P>
<P>
The ABARE forecasts are considered by the commodities industry
to be among the most optimistic analyses, the Australian
Associated Press said.

<HEADLINE> Sub-Saharan Africa Urged to Rely Less on Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Finance Minister Simeon
Nyachae has urged sub-Saharan Africa to look into other options
particularly in harnessing domestic resources as foreign aid to
the region has declined following the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
Governments in Africa must explore other ways to mobilize
domestic resources so as to rely less on foreign aid which was
expected to fall more rapidly in the medium term, he was quoted
by Tuesday's Daily Nation newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We have to accept that foreign aid is not going to continue
forever and can never be a substitute for domestic resource
mobilization and increased domestic savings and investment," he
said Monday at a regional workshop on the management of foreign
aid.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the lack of connections between foreign aid and
economic growth also indicated the poor management of aid in the
region, he added. The workshop was organized by the Harvard
Institute for International Development.
</P>
<P>
Compared with Latin America or parts of Asia, foreign aid to
sub-Saharan Africa has failed in poverty eradication, creating
employment and improving the standard of living of the majority
of people, he lamented.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the problem of debt service, which has plagued a
number of sub-Saharan countries for many decades, was one of the
constraints contributing to the lack of effectiveness of foreign
aid.
</P>
<P>
"Much of the foreign aid is required mainly to service foreign
debts, particularly to the multilateral institutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sub-Saharan Africa has a total debt of about 212 billion U.S.
Dollars and has been paying nearly 10.7 billion Dollars a year on
debt service between 1990 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
Between 1991 and 1992, the net overseas development assistance
to developing countries fell by 14 percent in real terms.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the total assistance by 21 of the world's richest
countries declined to its lowest level in 40 years to 0.27
percent of their gross national product (GNP).

<HEADLINE> Wool Prices Likely to Remain Volatile: ABARE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Australian federal
government's chief commodity adviser Tuesday slashed wool price
forecasts, citing volatility generated by the Asia financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The eastern market indicator is forecast to rise by over four
percent in (the coming financial year of) 1998/99 to average
around 705 cents a (clean) kilogram," the Australian Bureau of
Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) said in its March
quarterly forecasts.
</P>
<P>
ABARE expected the indicator to average 675 cents in the
current financial year of 1997-1998.
</P>
<P>
But this compares with the previous forecasts of 720 and 690
Australian cents respectively.
</P>
<P>
"With uncertainty generated by the Asian financial upheavals,
wool prices are likely to remain volatile," the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
There is a 75 percent probability of the final average price
for wool in 1998-1999 being between 610 and 745 cents a kilogram,
it said.
</P>
<P>
This is a lower range than the previous estimate of 610-755
Australian cents per kg.
</P>
<P>
Australian shorn wool production in 1998-1999 was anticipated
to jump more than three percent to 664,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Export earnings were tipped at 3.92 billion Australian dollars
in 1997-1998 and 3.94 billion Australian dollars the following
year.
</P>
<P>
This compares with the earlier estimates of 3.98 billion and
4.1 billion Australian dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said the touted 1998-1999 price rise reflected extra
demand for private stocks as the wool stockpile ran down and an
expected modest strengthening in world demand for raw wool.
</P>
<P>
Chinese demand for wool was forecast to rise over this period,
due to stronger domestic demand and extra exports to the United
States and western Europe, the bureau said.
</P>

KATHMANDU, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The third round of trade
negotiations under the SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement has
been rescheduled for April 20-22, a senior secretary of the
Kathmandu-based SAARC Secretariat said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the third round of negotiations, expected to be

of some member countries are being involved in meetings at home.
</P>
<P>
He said no disputes have emerged among the member countries
over the negotiations.

The previous two rounds of negotiations offered more than 2,000
items of products for tariff cuts ranging from 10 percent to 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
The third round, which is to adopt a combination of
product-by-product, sectoral and across-the-board approaches, is
expected to expand the list of products for concession.
</P>
<P>
This round should have ended in January, but was postponed as a

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong arrived here Tuesday on a 24-hour official visit to Myanmar
at the invitation of Senior-General Than Shwe, chairman of the
Myanmar State Peace and Development Council and prime minister.
</P>
<P>
This is Goh's second visit to Myanmar since March 1994 and
accompanying him are Foreign Minister S Jayakumar and other
officials as well as a 16-member business delegation.
</P>
<P>
Goh is scheduled to have official talks this afternoon with
Than Shwe on their two countries' cooperation, economic and
political development in Myanmar and regional developments,
according to Singapore sources.
</P>
<P>
After the official talks, Myanmar and Singapore will sign a
memorandum of understanding on mutual exemption of visas for
holders of diplomatic and official passports.
</P>
<P>
Goh's last Yangon visit resulted in a large volume of
Singaporean investment in Myanmar, bringing Singapore to the
second largest foreign investor status in the country after
Britain in the years followed.
</P>
<P>
In June 1995, Chairman Than Shwe visited Singapore, during
which an agreement on bilateral economic cooperation was
initiated.
</P>
<P>
As a follow-up, the two countries formed a Joint Ministerial
Working Committee (JMWC) on Promotion of Economic Cooperation,
Trade and Investment, working out projects in the sectors of
tourism, agriculture, livestock and fisheries, and human resources
development.
</P>
<P>
Two meetings of the two countries' JMWC were respectively held
in Yangon and Singapore in January 1996 and October 1997. During
the last meeting, two agreements were signed, the Maritime
Transport Agreement between the two governments and an agreement
between the two countries' chambers of commerce and industry.
</P>
<P>
Economic cooperation between Myanmar and Singapore has
developed rapidly in recent years.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Singapore's investment in
Myanmar amounted to 1.3 billion U.S. dollars in 65 permitted
projects at the end of 1997, covering sectors of hotels and
tourism, manufacturing, real estate, industrial estate,
construction and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also show that Myanmar and Singapore, one of
Myanmar's five major trading partners, had a bilateral trade
volume of 800 million dollars in 1997, in which Singapore's
exports to Myanmar shared 85 percent favoring Singapore in the
balance of trade, according to Singapore sources.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Rice Producer to Raise Rice Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hunan Province,
the country's largest rice producer, is making a new effort to
improve rice quality.
</P>
<P>
This year, the province plans to increase the acreage of
high-quality rice on slightly over one million hectares, some
300,000 hectares more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Hunan was once China's largest rice distribution center, and
the capital city of Changsha was also one of the country's big
four rice markets.
</P>
<P>
"Declining rice shares in the domestic rice market don't meet
the province's traditional status in rice production," said Liu
Dingshan, senior agronomist with the provincial Agriculture
Department.
</P>
<P>
The province grew rice on more than four million hectares last
year, and yielded some 26 billion kilograms of rice, still
remaining the country's most important rice producer.
</P>
<P>
Hunan has designated 24 counties as bases for rice improvement
projects, with 20 rice processing enterprises selected, in an
attempt to form a chain industry for high-quality rice production,
processing and sales.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that by 2010 the amount of directly consumed
rice will only account for half of the total rice output. That's
why most of the country's grain producers are intensifying efforts
to restructure agriculture.

<P>
Imports and exports are expected to hit 48.4 billion yuan, with
a 7.5 percent increase, he said.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Professionals Attracted to Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- An expert from the United States
has helped his Chinese counterparts develop a new variety of
sunflower seed, and trial production increased more than 1,000 kg
in output per hectare as well as nearly 2,000 yuan in cash to
farmers' pockets.
</P>
<P>
This is only one example of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region in northwest China to use foreign professionals in
promoting local economic development.
</P>
<P>
Expansion of the variety is expected to bring more than 200
million yuan of income to growers annually, according to official
estimates from the regional Academy of Agricultural Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Underdeveloped Xinjiang lacks professionals engaged in high and
new technological research. So, the regional government began in
recent years to use overseas experts for some major construction
or research projects.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Xinjiang invited nearly 300 foreign professionals, and
in turn sent more than 700 local technicians abroad to receive
special training.
</P>
<P>
Lang Zhongqiang, general manager of the Xinjiang United
Machinery Group Co., is a good example in this effort. He applied
the management expertise he had learned in Hong Kong and the
United States to his company, and has brought profits to a once
money-losing enterprise, which now holds the lion's share of the
country's harvester market.
</P>
<P>
Baore, magistrate of Hejing County, is another example. The
Mongolian ethnic official put into practice what he had learned in
Australia about family-based livestock farms.
</P>
<P>
As a result, local herdsmen have been able to settle down
during winter and spring seasons, while in summer and autumn, they
would put out to pastures, moving from on place to another, to
partly end the history of nomadic life.

<P>
Domestic tourists will reach two to 2.5 billion by the year
2010, with annual tourism output value of 1.3 to 1.4 trillion
yuan, accounting for eight percent of China's GDP.

tourism income will be 360 billion yuan, and foreign earnings will
be 14 million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Forest Shelter Around Chinese Capital Producing Good Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A forest shelter around the
Chinese capital city of Beijing has contributed greatly to the
improvement of the local ecological environment and helped over
one million people shake off poverty.
</P>
<P>
The project, one of the key projects of the Sanbei (north,
northwest and northeast China) forest shelter network, covers 3.47
million hectares in an area where 50 counties of north China's
Hebei Province are located.
</P>
<P>
The region is the major water source for Beijing and Tianjin,
as well as a windy and sandy base threatening the two cities. At
present, the region provides 81 percent of Beijing's water source
and 93.7 percent for Tianjin Municipality.
</P>
<P>
The project was designated by the central government in 1986,
and by 1996, the forest coverage rate in 50 project-reached
counties has reached 25.22 percent and soil erosion dropped 88
percent.
</P>
<P>
As a result, sandy days in Beijing dropped from the former
average 20.6 annually to the current 10, and the dust amount in
the air is reduced by 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the project can produce 250 million cubic
meters of timber, and help set up 24 fruit bases.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, processing of forestry side-line products
produced 4.6 billion yuan in output value, with a profit of 1
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
A total of 411 villages involving over 80,000 households have
shaken off poverty through planting trees and develop
fruit-related industries.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Likely to Increase Gas Price By 60 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh's Ministry of Energy
has submitted a proposal for a 60 percent gas price hike in two
phases to the Cabinet for approval, the independent United News of
Bangladesh (UNB) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A 31 percent increase in the gas prices in the first phase is
to be effective from July and a 29 percent rise from October,
according to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Justifying the proposal, Energy Minister Nooruddin Kham said:
"It has become inevitable because of increases in gas prices on
the international market."
</P>
<P>
If the price is not increased immediately, the country would
face tremendous losses when it starts buying gas of the Sangu
field from the Cairn company), an official from the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
According to a contract, the Cairn owns 30 percent of the gas
to be produced from the Sangu field, and the Bangladeshi
government is committed to buying the gas from the Cairn at
international prices.
</P>
<P>
"Buying at international rate and selling at domestic price
will cause a big pressure on the exchequer," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The country presently produces 810 million cubic feet of gas
daily. But the total estimated daily domestic demand is around 1.2
billion cubic feet.

<HEADLINE> Insurance Salespersons Pop Up In Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- When life insurance salespersons
first appeared on the streets of Shanghai six years ago, local
people called them Mr. Street-Runner, because they thought that
people who ran around trying to persuade people to be their
clients were funny.
</P>
<P>
Now however, people have changed their minds and life insurance
is big business. In 1997, insurance companies earned 5.6 billion
yuan in life-insurance premiums, an average of 450 yuan per person
in Shanghai, and ten times the 1992 figure.
</P>
<P>
The are also more than 15,000 insurance salespersons. Recently,
16 of them got meritorious work awards for their success in
developing the insurance business.
</P>
<P>
The people of Shanghai now know the life insurance business
better than the people of any other city in China, owing to the
hard work of these salespersons. A recent study shows that 15 percent
of the local people hold life insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
Another study has shown that 80 percent of the locals want to
cover risks by getting insurance instead of the traditional method
of relying on the government and their work units.
</P>
<P>
To see that insurance sales;persons have the proper
credentials, local insurance companies have placed great
emphasis on training and professionalism. Any salesperson who
breaks the rules will be penalized.
</P>
<P>
Some universities offer special classes on life insurance.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Chinese Woman Welder Becomes Godmother of Greek Tanker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, March 24 (Xinhua) --Cong Juhong, a woman welder with
the new plant of northeast China's Dalian Shipyard, had never
imagined she could someday become godmother of a foreign oil tanker
she helped build.
</P>
<P>
On March 20, M. Vordnis, president and also managing executive
of the Greek Thenamaris Company, announced in front of an imposing
oil tanker that he, on behalf of the ship owner, invited Cong, head
of the welding group of the Dalian plant's pipeline processing
workshop, as godmother of the oil tanker out of gratitude.
</P>
<P>
"I name you as 'Seaqueen', and wish from the bottom of my
heart that you and the crew on board always be safe and lucky, "
proclaimed Cong before the 110,000-dwt (dead weight tonnages) oil
tanker, wearing a crimson suit.
</P>
<P>
Through meticulous makeup of a local beauty parlor, the
46-year-old woman welder looked much younger than her real
age. But her hard-to-hide coarse hands seemingly convey to the
people the great contributions Cong has made in building the
tanker.
</P>
<P>
Cong, who has worked as a welder for 32 years, then used her
coarse hands to cut off a rope tied to the tanker with a golden
axe. The red cloth covering the oil tanker fell off, showing
"Seaqueen", the name of the tanker, amid of applauses of the
on-looking crowd.
</P>
<P>
Cong has won certificates of qualified welding technology
certified by major registers of shipping in the world and her work
is exempted from checkups.
</P>
<P>
Godmothers of foreign vessels are usually acted by wives of
general managers of ship companies. It is the first time for a
Chinese shipbuilding worker to be godmother of a foreign vessel.
</P>
<P>
An insider said the Greek ship owner made the decision of
inviting a common Chinese shipbuilding worker to be the godmother
of the oil tanker as he was quite satisfied with the quality of
the tanker.
</P>
<P>
K. Dokianos, Greece's Ambassador to China, said that ship
owners in Greece are fully confident of China's modern
shipbuilding industry, of both her technology and her workers.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the new plant of the Dalian
Shipyard has received orders for building another eight
110,000-dwt oil tankers.

<HEADLINE> China's Chain Businesses See Rapid Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The latest survey conducted by
China's commercial departments shows that chain businesses in the
country developed fairly fast in 1997, with chain stores rapidly
expanding in both scale and number.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, the number of retail chain stores with a
sales volume of over 50 million yuan (six million US dollars) each
reached 97, while the number of chain stores in the catering trade
with a sales volume of over 20 million yuan each reached 29.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that China's leading chain enterprises largely
enhanced their scales through alliance, merging and
acquisition. The number of chain enterprises with a sales volume
of over 100 million yuan each increased from 20 in 1996 to 57 in
1997, and the total sales volume of chain stores increased sharply
from 4.6 billion yuan to 16.1 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that leading chain enterprises have
expanded their chain networks from coastal cities to inland
areas. In 1996 some 65 percent of large chain enterprises were in
Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, while last year 60 percent of
large chain enterprises were distributed in the provinces of
Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Hubei, as well as in Northeast and
Northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Private enterprises are playing an increasingly bigger role in
chain business, and the business scope of chain stores has also
been expanded from home facilities, garments and shoes to
medicine, motor vehicles and construction materials, the survey
says.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Trade Deficit Drops in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' trade deficit
dropped by 37.4 percent to 717 million U.S. dollars in January
this year from the year-ago level, the National Statistics Office
(NSO) said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The NSO said in a report that the total trade for the month
reached 4.947 billion dollars. Export receipts went up by 25
percent to 2.115 billion dollars while import payments kept almost
the year-ago level of 2.832 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Accounting for nearly 20 percent of the aggregate value of
imports, the Philippines' payment for electronics and components
posted a 37.5-percent increase to 566.2 million dollars, the NSO
said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the payment for capital goods grew by 23.4
percent to 1.29 billion dollars, followed by expenditures on raw
material and intermediate goods.
</P>
<P>
However, electronics and components were also the Philippines'
top export items while capital goods and raw material were a must
for the fast-growing exports industry.
</P>
<P>
The United States was at the same time the top supplier of the
Philippines' imported goods and the top buyer of its exports.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchman
Monday called for more efforts in fighting against the rampant
economic crimes in the country.
</P>
<P>
Kuchman told a meeting of interior officials that economic
crimes in Ukraine have gone up 65.9 percent in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Kuchman said a monitoring system on banking business accounting
has not yet been established, which has led to the illegal flow of
20 billion U.S. dollars to foreign countries between 1991 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
He called on the police to strike at the roots of the notorious
criminal groups and to fight economic crimes.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine has been afflicted with a growing number of economic
crimes in recent years, with 1997 alone seeing some 360 cases of
economic crimes or cases in the field of financial credit and
banking.
</P>
<P>
The "shadow economy," a term to define criminal activities such
as smuggling, producing and selling tax-evading products, has
severely blocked Ukraine's economic development.

<HEADLINE> Hewlett Packard to Bring Internet Monitoring Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Hewlett Packard, the
renowned U.S.-based information technology firm, plans to bring an
Internet mentioning program called "E-monitoring" to Malaysia,
where the company's employees would mentor young people keen in
information technology.
</P>
<P>
Hewlett Packard is confident that Malaysia's Multimedia Super
Corridor (MSC) project will not be affected much by the regional
economic crisis, the company's President and Chief Executive
Officer Lewis E. Platt said here Tuesday after discussions with
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
</P>
<P>
"I think the good news is that the MSC won't suffer because of
the current economic issues," Platt, who is a member of the
International Advisory Panel for the MSC, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said he was satisfied with the way the government was
tackling the currency and economic problems.
</P>
<P>
He said he and Mahathir talked about the MSC in general, its
development and also discussed bringing in Hewlett Packard's
Internet monitoring program called "E-monitoring" whereby the
company's employees would mentor young people keen in information
technology via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The program, started four years ago, has already attracted
1,500 Hewlett Packard employees worldwide on a voluntary basis.
</P>
<P>
Hewlett Packard already has investments in Malaysia with two
companies operating in the MSC, a 750 square kilometer zone
located south of Kuala Lumpur and designated as the hub for the
development of multimedia products and services in the country.
</P>
<P>
Hewlett Packard's first company in the MSC is involved in
management and operations development while the second one is
engaged in software activities.

<HEADLINE> Australia Bans Imports of Semi-Automatic Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Imports of semi-automatic guns
will be banned from midnight Wednesday (tonight) in Australia with
few exemptions as Australian Prime Minister John Howard moves to
enforce the national uniform gun laws forged after the 1996 Port
Arthur massacre.
</P>
<P>
John Howard said the Australian parliament would change customs
laws to make sure the guns could not be made available outside the
guidelines agreed to by police ministers.
</P>
<P>
The move comes after Victoria and Queensland states
foreshadowed plans to amend their state gun laws to give field and
game shooters greater access to semi-automatic weapons, and to
scrap the 28-day waiting period for licensed owners to buy a
second weapon.
</P>
<P>
Howard said the federal government would use all of its powers
to make sure the national gun laws remained intact.
</P>
<P>
"As a first step, the government will be putting a
recommendation to His Excellency the Governor-General this
afternoon, so that with effect from midnight tonight, there will
be a ban introduced on weapons designated as category C under the
1996 agreement," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, an agreement on tougher gun control was reached
between the federal and state governments on gun control soon
after 35 people were killed by a gunmen at Port Arthur in the
island state of Tasmania.
</P>
<P>
Since then, tens of thousands of guns have been surrendered by
gun owners to government departments as a result of the federal
and state governments' program to buy back the guns banned under
the agreement during a fixed period.
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister said farmers would be able to
receive an exemption from the ban if they could produce police
guarantees they were primary producers, and clay target shooters
could receive an exemption with the written authority of the
federal Attorney-General.
</P>
<P>
He said gun dealers would also be able to import a limited
number of guns to hold in bond for customers who passed the
exemptions.

<P>
VIENNA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The average price of OPEC's basket
of seven crudes dropped to 11.22 U.S. dollars per barrel last week
from 11.83 dollars per barrel in the previous week, the
Vienna-based OPEC Secretariat on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The price continued to decline after some producers said they
will cut oil production.
</P>
<P>
OPEC member countries Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and non-OPEC
producer Mexico, announced on Sunday that they would cut oil
production by 1.1 million barrels a day beginning April 1 until
the end of this year in an attempt to stablize and promote oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices have been down since late last year when a rise in
the OPEC output ceiling collided with weak demand from
crisis-struck Asia.
</P>
<P>
The average price of OPEC's basket of seven crudes, which OPEC
uses to monitor the oil market supply, is now at the lowest level
in almost a decade.

registered a deficit of 254 million U.S. dollars in February, a
significant decline from the 384 million dollars a year ago.
</P>

billion dollars while the expense was 5.362 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA -- The traffic toll collected by the

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka MP to Be Asked to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Leader of Sri Lanka's opposition
United National Party (UNP) Ranil Wickremesinghe will call for the
resignation of a member of parliament of its own party for the
sake of the UNP's image cleaning, the official Daily News reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Wijepala Mendis, a cabinet minister in the former UNP
government (1977-1994), was last year found guilty by a Special
Presidential Commission of misuse and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
Mendis, the chief opposition whip, was accused of having used
influence and exchanged 76 acres of fallow land for 76 acres of
prime coconut land, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The commission recommended Mendis be deprived of civil rights
for seven years and expelled from parliament.
</P>
<P>
The government last week moved a motion to implement the
Commission's recommendation despite a UNP boycott of parliament,
and debated the issue for a full day. The debate is to be
continued next month when a vote will also be taken.
</P>
<P>
A two-thirds majority in parliament is required to pass the
motion and this could not be obtained unless the UNP supports the
government.
</P>
<P>
The UNP, however, has decided to ask Mendis to resign as an MP
so that the matter could be resolved.
</P>
<P>
The UNP, which is fighting to project a clean image of itself
to the public, would find it hard to oppose the government motion,
as it would appear that it is still trying to shield dishonest
persons.
</P>
<P>
Almost 90 percent of the UNP's members of parliament have
requested their leader to call for Mendis' resignation as the
easiest way out of the crisis.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Expected to Rise by Two Dollars Per barrel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Oil prices could increase by two
U.S. dollars per barrel since Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico
agreed to reduce oil output on Sunday, the state-run oil company
Petroleos de Venezuela predicted Monday.
</P>
<P>
The three countries said in a statement released in Riyadh,
capital of Saudi Arabia, that they would coordinate with other
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) and non-OPEC members.
</P>
<P>
The countries will cut production by 1.1 million barrels a day
by April 1. The cutbacks are expected to trim from 1.6 million
barrels a day to 2 million barrels from the oil market, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela will cut production by 200,000 barrels a day out of
its total output of 3.2 million barrels daily, the Ministry of
Energy and Mines said.
</P>
<P>
The three countries said they were responding to low oil prices
in the first three months of 1998, caused by lower-than-expected
demand.
</P>
<P>
The Riyadh statement is an attempt to help crude oil prices
recover in the international markets, said the Venezuelan oil
company.
</P>
<P>
The price of OPEC's basket of crudes, which it uses to gauge
the market, is about 11.42 dollars a barrel, down from 18.81
dollars in November, the lowest level in almost a decade when OPEC
decided to raise its production ceiling by 10 percent to 27.5
million barrels a day.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Bank Puts US$ 500 Million in Foreign Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia (BI), the central
bank, has placed 100 million U.S. dollars in each of five overseas
banks to guarantee letters of credit (L/Cs) issued by Indonesian
importers, the bank's director said.
</P>
<P>
The five banks are ABN Amro Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, Bank
of America, Citi Bank and Deutsche Bank, Miranda Goeltom said
Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
The placement of fund followed the signing of bilateral
agreements between Bank Indonesia and the five banks a few days
ago, the official Antara News Agency Tuesday quoted the director
as saying.
</P>
<P>
She said Bank Indonesia is planning to place similar fund in
another five banks.
</P>
<P>
In the past several months, overseas banks had refused to
accept letters of credit issued by Indonesian importers because of
the economic situation in the country and the continued
depreciation of the rupiah against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Miranda said Indonesian importers could now open L/Cs to import
raw materials because the L/Cs had been confirmed by the overseas
banks.

<HEADLINE> More Young People Carry TB Virus in Bulgaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, March 23 (Xinhua) - Two in 10 Bulgarian youths may carry
the tuberculosis virus, said health ministry experts Monday.
</P>
<P>
Although many have been vaccinated, they may develop the
disease at a later stage because regular malnutrition weakens
their immune system.
</P>
<P>
After several TB-free decades in Bulgaria, the disease made a
re-appearance in 1996. Now with more than 13,000 persons infected
as a result of late diagnoses, the virus, they said, may be passed
on to as many as 10-15 family members or friends during daily
contacts.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 children in the country have been registered with
TB, they said.
</P>
<P>
A statistical survey states that living standards are not a
critical factor for TB infection. Poor diet and the absence of
protein in the diet, as well as a general increase in resistance
of the virus to medicines, all make Bulgarians more susceptible to
infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
A total of 3 billion leva (1.67 million U.S. dollars), or 10
times as much as last year, have been allocated to implement the
1998 program for TB control. The government will began in April to
conduct a TB checkup for more than one million Bulgarians,
particularly diabetics, alcoholics and HIV-carriers, to the survey
shows.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government plans to open a national center to
register TB patients. Some 550 patients will enroll in a
state-of-the-art program for treating tuberculosis. The treatment
is being introduced in 77 countries.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Cuba Vow to Strengthen Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Evgeni
Primakov and his visiting Cuban counterpart Roberto Robaina
Gonzalez met here Monday to discuss bilateral relations and
international issues of common interest.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also signed a consular convention the same day.
</P>
<P>
Russia is opposed to the economic blockade and the containment
policy practised by the U.S. and west European countries against
Cuba, Primakov told a news conference after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Russia has made efforts to energize the normalization of
Cuban-U.S. relations and it welcomes the measures taken by Cuba
toward democratization, said the Russian minister.
</P>
<P>
The current Russian-Cuban relations lay emphasis on the present
and the future while drawing experience from the past, Primakov
said.
</P>
<P>
Robaina, who arrived here Sunday, hopes the high-ranking
bilateral talks would help promote the economic cooperation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Russia's relations with Cuba have improved in recent years as
Russia adjusted its western-oriented foreign policy since the
disintegration of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
The "Declaration of the Principles of Reciprocal Relations
between Russia and Cuba," which was signed during Primakov's 1996
Cuban visit, paved the way for a new cooperative partnership
between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Importers Will Buy Tea Directly From Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 24 (Xinhua) -- From June this year, importers
will be able to buy tea directly from Sri Lanka, the Island
newspaper said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Overseas buyers are now purchasing tea from the London tea
auctions. But effective from June 14, the London tea auctions will
be closed and buyers could purchase tea directly from producing
countries, it said.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka is the world's largest black tea exporter with an
output of 276.8 million kilograms last year.
</P>
<P>
What was supplied to states of the former Soviet Union as pure
Sri Lankan tea from the London auctions was in fact a blend of
teas from different countries, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
While 70 percent of the tea consumed in Saudi Arabia was from
Sri Lanka, other main buyers were Turkey, Iran and Jordan, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's tea production has increased by seven percent last
year thanks to adequate rainfall and improved agricultural
practices.
</P>
<P>
The production of tea, one of the country's main export items
and the source of over 25 percent of its export earnings, has
risen steadily in recent years from 242.4 million kilograms in
1994 to 245.9 kilograms in 1995 and again to 259.4 kilograms in
1996.

LONDON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A pair of chairmen of Newcastle
United Football Club resigned after allegations that they made
disparaging comments on football players, a spokesman for them
said on Tuesday in Newcastle, Britain.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of Newcastle United Football Club, Freddy
Shepherd, and vice-chairman Douglas Hall, stepped down their posts
also because they mocked fans and described local women as "dogs".
</P>
<P>
Douglas Hall was quoted as saying Englans star Paul Gascoigne
was "finished", that Newcastle defender Philippe Albert had just
two years left in football and that former England striker Gary
Lineker would never make it as a manager.
</P>
<P>
Newcastle directors discussed the crisis on Monday and some of
the club officials wanted the pair to resign.
</P>
<P>
Speculation is that former Newcastle chairman and father of
Douglas Hall, Sir John Hall, could return to the directorship of
the club.

<HEADLINE> IMF Welcomes Bank Indonesia's Interest Rate Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) Monday welcomed a decision of Bank Indonesia to increase
interest rates on Bank Indonesia Certificate (SBI).
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by IMF Asia-Pacific Director Hubert
Neiss, who has been here since March 18 to discuss with the
Indonesian government economic reforms in the country, said he saw
the action as part of the Indonesian government's strategy to
control inflation and strengthen the rupiah, the country's
currency.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia, the central bank, announced the increase of
short-term SBI interest rates in a bid to stabilize the rupiah
against the U.S. dollar and curb inflation.
</P>
<P>
According to the announcement, the two-day SBI interest rate
was raised from 35 to 41 percent, three to six days from 30 to 42
percent, one month from 22 to 45 percent, two and three months
from 20 to 40 percent and from 19 to 30 percent respectively. For
six-month and one-year SBI, the rates were raised from 18 to 20
percent and from 16 to 18 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
SBI is short-term rupiah-denominated obligations issued by the
central bank to drain excess liquidity from the market.
</P>
<P>
Neiss also expressed satisfaction with the progress made over
the past few days in discussions to review Indonesia's economic
program.
</P>
<P>
"We have had productive meetings and progress has been made in
all five areas of work such as monetary policy, bank
restructuring, the budget and subsidies, structural reforms and
corporate debt," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia signed a 50-point agreement with the IMF on January
15 in exchange for a bailout package of more than 40 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Indonesia promised to conduct wide-ranging
economic, financial and trade reforms in the country.
</P>
<P>
IMF gave its first 3 billion dollar tranche to Indonesia in
December last year.
</P>
<P>
However, it withheld the second tranche worth 3 billion dollars
earlier this month because of what it called the lack of reforms
in the country.

<HEADLINE> Forest Fires Out of Control: Thai Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The forest fires in a sanctuary
and a national park have been out of control due to winds and dry
conditions there, the Thai Forestry Department admitted.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Post newspaper said Tuesday that forest fires in
the Huay Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary in the northern province of
Uthai Thani and the Khao Yai National Park in the northeastern
province of Nakhon Ratchasima have become serious.
</P>
<P>
Besides, another fire is raging for the sixth day at Toa Daeng,
the country's biggest peat swamp forest in Narathiwat Province in
the south, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Forest Fire Control Division Director Kaew Lopatanakasem said
several hot spots in Huay Kha Khaeng, which have been brought
under control, are also likely to catch fire again.
</P>
<P>
Satellite images have confirmed that tens of thousands of
hectares of forest in the sanctuary have been destroyed since
fires broke out last November.
</P>
<P>
The Remote Sensing Division of the National Research Council
reported that some fires seem to have been caused by farmland
clearing by villagers.
</P>
<P>
The Forestry Department said it could be very difficult to
control the fires since the sanctuary is extremely dry, with water
available only from Srinakharin Dam at the southern edge.
</P>
<P>
Officials said they could do nothing more than creating buffer
zones to keep the fires at bay.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the officials estimated that about 3,360 hectares of
deciduous forest have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Thailand have been suffering extraordinarily dry weather this
year, which is believed to be the result of the El Nino
phenomenon.

<HEADLINE> H-Shares to Assist Coal Firm in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Yanzhou Coal Mining in east
China's Shandong Province announced Monday a global offering of
820 million H shares, which is expected to raise two billion Hong
Kong dollars (256 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The float is divided into three parts -- ten percent for public
offering in Hong Kong, 45 percent for offering in the United
States and another 45 percent in the rest of the world, according
to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Shares offered outside Hong Kong will be American Depository
Shares, or ADS, each equal to 50 normal shares, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The shares are expected to be priced between 2.16 HK dollars
and 2.67 HK dollars excluding transaction levy and commission
fees, and final pricing will be available on Friday when public
subscription ends.
</P>
<P>
Trading in the shares will begin next Tuesday on the New York
Stock Exchange and on April 1 on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Net proceeds from the float will be used to finance the listed
arm's purchase from its Shandong-based parent of Jining Coal Mine
phase two.
</P>
<P>
With an output of 16.9 million tons of raw coal last year, the
company has been the dominant coal supplier in east China, said
Luo Taiyan, executive director of Yanzhou Coal Mining.
</P>
<P>
Yanzhou exports roughly one-third of its output, mainly to
Japan, making it one of China's biggest coal exporters.

<HEADLINE> Thai Army Ordered to Protect Border at All Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Thai Army Chief General Chettha
Thanajaro has ordered his troops to use all possible military
means to counter Myanmar Karen guerrillas following another
cross-border raid on a refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
Karen guerrillas early Monday attacked the Mawkier refugee camp
 on the Thai-Myanmar border, killing one refugee and wounding 13
people, including four Thai soldiers, the newspaper Bangkok Post
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The army chief is enraged with the latest cross-border assault
and has ordered the Third Army to use all kinds of military means
in countering the aggression," the paper quoted an unidentified
army source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The paper said some 40 Karen guerrillas crossed into Thailand
and raided the camp. Four Thai soldiers were taken hostage during
the raid but some 10 intruders were thought to have been trapped
behind Thai soldier lines following the attack.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Karen guerrillas, led by the Democratic Karen
Buddhist Army (DKBA), carried out scores of attacks on Karen
refugees taking shelter in Thailand, believing that the displaced
population harbors and supports the DKBA's rivals, according to
the paper.
</P>
<P>
In an attack earlier this month, four refugees were killed and
30 wounded when a camp was hit by mortar rounds.
</P>
<P>
A top Myanmar general at the weekend told the Thai Army chief
that Myanmar troops were not involved in the recent spate of
attacks and had no control over the Karen guerrillas. He said the
Thai Army could talk any action deemed necessary to counter the
raids, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Doctors Use New Form Of Hydrotherapy For Hypertension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Feeling anxious or worried about
your high blood pressure? Well, Chinese doctors have a new form of
therapy where you just lie on a watery surface and try to fall
asleep.
</P>
<P>
The method, "floating therapy", may provide hope for those who
suffer from hypertension or certain other problems like
anxiousness and insomnia, doctors say.
</P>
<P>
It uses a bath of warm water with medicinal materials, in which
the patient is isolated from any outside stimulus, such as light
and sound.
</P>
<P>
In this environment, the patient will fall asleep and be
completely relaxed, making it an effective treatment for
anxiousness and insomnia, according to Dr. Hu Peicheng, who has
pioneered in the use of the treatment.
</P>
<P>
The method caused endorphins to be released by the brain. It
has also been found to be helpful in providing relief from the
pain of rheumatoid arthritis, Hu says.
</P>
<P>
However, Doctor Hu, who has treated about 300 patients in this
way, cautions that this form of treatment is not omnipotent and
will last longer if it is combined with certain drugs.

ROME, March 23 (Xinhua) -- A north-bound express train collided
on Monday with a train near Florence, killing one passenger and
seriously injuring 23 others, reports here said.
</P>
<P>
The express train was traveling from Rome to Bergamo, in
northern Italy, when it collided with a south-bound train
traveling between Florence and Viareggio on the west coast.
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred near the station of Castello on the
outskirts of Florence, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The man who was killed was on board the north-bound train.
Both trains were derailed when the express train collided with the
other.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the express locomotive ignored a stop signal at
the Castello station, which allowed the other train to continue.
The crash happened during a heavy downpour, which is suspected of
having a role in the accident.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers rushed to the scene and the injured were sent to a
nearby hospital after a fireman aboard one of the trains called
for help with his cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
The collision was the latest in a series of accidents involving
the Italian state-run railroads. Three trains derailed on
separate occasions on March 2. Another train derailed last month,

JAKARTA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has

<TEXT>
<P>
VALLETTA, ITALY, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The international
community should take positive steps to narrow the gap in the
level of telecoms development between the developed and developing
countries, a Chinese official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Deqiang, head of a Chinese delegation, told the 2nd World
Telecommunication Development Conference (WTDC'98) that the
shortage of capital and advanced technology and equipment has
prevented developing countries from modernizing their
telecommunication facilities.
</P>
<P>
Thus, developed countries, equipment manufacturers and world
financial institutions have the duty to assist them in the fields
of loans, technology transfer and personnel training.
</P>
<P>
As a developing country, China has made great strides in its
telecommunications in recent years, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
The total capacity of telephone network in China has come to
110 million lines, with a yearly increase of 20 million switching
lines.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this century, the teledensity nation-wide will
reach 13 percent and the total capacity of telephone network will
be 166 million lines, the head of the Chinese delegation said.

NANCHANG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- China is likely to have some
major flooding south of the Yangtze River this year, partly owing
to El Nino, Vice-minister of Water Resources, Zhou Wenzhi, told a
recent meeting on flood control in the capital of Jiangxi Province.

Southern China had an unusual winter, characterized by

<HEADLINE> About 50,000 Poor Panamanian Children Seek Work, Says UNICEF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Extreme poverty is forcing
nearly 50,000 Panamanian children, or 11 out of every 100, to work
or look for a job, a report by the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Eleven of every 100 Panamanian children under 17 years of age
are looking for a job or already work in activities such as
domestic labors, sugar cane harvesting, packing, and street sales,"
the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Sixty-six percent of the working children in Panama are
employed in the agricultural sector, while 34 percent have a job
in a city," it said.
</P>
<P>
These children earn an average of 85 dollars per month. The
minimum wage is double that figure, said a UNICEF official
Anayansi Turner.
</P>
<P>
Turner added that in addition to low incomes, they also have to
work long hours.
</P>
<P>
Among every three maids working for a wealthy family, two are
forced to work more than 12 hours per day, she added.
</P>
<P>
Turner went on to say that employers hire children to save on
salaries, fringe benefits and social welfare.

BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region says it will spend 10.2 billion yuan (1.2
billion US dollars) on infrastructure for the next century,
according to today's People's Daily.
</P>

Investment in infrastructure is expected to grow by more than
20 percent this year, with more funding going to agriculture,
coal, power and energy. Over 600 million yuan will be spent on
agriculture, poverty-relief programs, and agricultural
industrialization.
</P>
<P>
Another four billion yuan will be spent on energy,
transportation, telecommunications, metallurgy, and the chemical
industry.
</P>
<P>
The scale of infrastructure projects will increase also. Ten
out of the 210 construction and expansion projects and seven
technical renovation projects are key projects involving over four
billion yuan.

the Finnish Defense Forces have not made any preparations for an
alignment, she added.

<HEADLINE> Southern Chinese Garden City Beautifying Itself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The reason Nanning, the capital
of south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, has won three
national medals for its environmental protection efforts in a mere
three years seems obvious to most people who have visited the city.
</P>
<P>
The city won the "national sanitary city", "national model city
for comprehensive management of urban environment", and
"state-level garden city" awards between 1995 and 1997, partly
because, for the past three years, it has spent 160 million yuan
(19.27 million US dollars) on greenery.
</P>
<P>
New regulations and measures promoting this in recent years
apply to gardens, tree planting, and tree protection. The city has
files on all of its 141 old trees that are under protection. And,
in the past two years, it has rejected 134 project applications to
protect 849 trees, and has dealt with 590 cases involving illegal
felling of trees and 344 cases in violation of rules on greenery.
</P>
<P>
It has built many gardens for the plants and flowers of
southern China, and has a tea garden and a medicinal plants garden
with over 2,400 types of plants, the largest in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
A grassly area is being built along a five-kilometer stretch of
city streets.
</P>
<P>
The improved environment has attracted more foreign
investors. In 1996 and 1997, foreign investment in the city
exceeded 500 million US dollars, matching the total for the
1991-1995 period.
</P>
<P>
The acid rain, which threatened the city for many years, is now
under control, thanks to the local government's effort to control
industrial pollution. The city government decided to hold an
environmental protection meeting every three months and passed a
series of penalties for those who violate the regulations.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the city has spent 40 million yuan on
desulphurization, and a national environment study in late January
showed that the air quality of Nanning was at Level 1.
</P>
<P>
At present, 85 percent of the city's industrial waste water is
being treated and 70 percent of the industrial waste water
discharge meets standards.
</P>
<P>
A system of contracts helps guarantee the maintenance of a
clean environment in the city, where each government official is
responsible for sanitary conditions on one street. All of the
city's work units and neighborhood committees, even outdoor
markets, have their own sanitary organizations that look after the
removal of garbage right away.
</P>
<P>
The city has also established 437 schools teaching social and
occupational ethics and family morality and has 30 patriotic
education centers and a moral code for its citizens. It has 33
local regulations and over 100 rules that see to it that the city
is managed in accordance with the law.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Begins Probing Jet Overshooting Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Air Transportation
Office (ATO) has ordered an investigation into the overshooting of
a passenger plane Sunday night in Bacolod City in the central part
of the country, local newspaper Malaya reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted ATO chief Carlos Tanega as saying the focus
will be on pilot error since the plane was in good condition
before it overshot the runway, killing three people on the ground
and injuring a total of 150 others.
</P>
<P>
Tanega said safety officials of Airbus Corporation, the
aircraft's manufacturer, will arrive Tuesday from France to help
in the probe and in deciphering the black box of the plane.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the Bacolod Airport tower said the pilots of the
plane should have made a landing on the touchdown zone indicated
by two white stripes at the start of the runway.
</P>
<P>
However, it seemed that due to "miscalculation," the jet
touched down beyond the first half of the runway, making it
difficult for the pilots to stop the plane, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Some other sources said brake failure while landing was the
cause of the accident.
</P>
<P>
The jet, which plowed into a commercial area, is a complete
wreck. Investigators said they would not move it until they finish
their job.
</P>
<P>
There were 127 passengers and crew members aboard the plane.
All of them were safe despite some injuries.
</P>
<P>
The air accident occurred just six weeks after a plane crashed
in a mountain area in the southern Philippines. All the 104
passengers and crew on board were killed in the disaster.

WASHINGTON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- World No.1 Pete Sampras was
eliminated from the Lipton Tennis Championships when he lost to
South Africa's Wayne Ferreira 0-6, 7-6 (8/6) and 6-3 in Key
Biscayne, the United States on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ferreira saved two match points in the second-set tie-breaker
before toppling Sampras in the third round of the 4.6
million-dollar ATP and WTA event. Sampras has now lost four times
in 19 matches this year.
</P>
<P>
Now the American star could be dethroned from his perch atop
the men's tennis world by No.2-ranked Czech player Petr Korda,
third-ranked Marcelo Rios or even Britain's Greg Rusedski, ranked
fourth.

In women's play, American Serena Williams, the bead-tressed
sister of teen star Venus Williams, has a quarter-final date with
world No.1 Martina Hingis.
</P>

</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>

WASHINGTON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- US. national figure skating
champion Michelle Kwan, who settled for Nagano Olympic silver
behind compatriot Tara Lipinski last month, is going for gold in
2002.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese-American star said Monday in a telephone conference
that she wants to take another chance at the gold medal that
eluded her in Japan.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to go to 2002 just to give it another try," Kwan
said. "There's no guarantee I will win there. I would like to go
and try, just to give it another try."
</P>
<P>
Before the next Winter Olympics four years later, Kwan's next
task at hand is the World Championships in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
Lipinski, who lost to Kwan at the US championships before
beating her in Nagano, will skip the worlds, as will Games
medalists Chen Lu of China, Elvis Stojko of Canada and Philippe

<HEADLINE> Tuberculosis Death Rate Surprisingly High in South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Some 8.7 of 100,000 South Koreans
die of tuberculosis (TB) every year, making the nation's
TB-related death rate highest among the countries of Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the Korean National Tuberculosis
Association Monday showed that the nation's improved treatment has
significantly reduced the rate of TB infections from 5.1 percent,
or 1.24 million people, in 1965 to 1.03 percent, or 430,000, in
1995.
</P>
<P>
However, comparing with the developing countries, South Korea's
TB death rate has remained high.
</P>
<P>
The association did not explain what has caused the high death
rate since the country has made great progress in economy and
medicine.

MANILA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items

</P>
<P>
Manila Bulletin:
</P>
<P>
-- President Fidel Ramos Monday called for closer cooperation
among Asia-Pacific countries in the battle against transnational
crime by harmonizing their laws and consolidating all possible
modalities for cooperation on the administrative, legislative and
judicial levels.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Journal:

</P>
<P>
The Business Daily:
</P>
<P>
-- The main share index of the Philippine Stock Exchange
continued its gradual but nevertheless spectacular climb Monday,
closing at a seven-month high as prospects of lower interest rates
spurred buying in property shares.
</P>
<P>
Business World:
</P>
<P>
-- The yield rate on the 91-day Treasury bill, the benchmark
instrument banks use to price their loans, fell to a five-month

<HEADLINE> Study: Deadline Did Little to Move Recipients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- In the first evaluation of
time limits for people on welfare in the United States,
researchers found that a looming deadline did little to encourage
recipients to get off the rolls more quickly on their own.
</P>
<P>
The study of a program in Pensacola, Florida, also found that
only about half of welfare recipients had found a job when kicked
off.
</P>
<P>
For most of the nation's history, cash assistance was available
as long as needed to anyone poor enough to qualify.
</P>
<P>
Today, welfare recipients across the country face a five-year
time limit imposed by the 1996 federal welfare overhaul law. Many
states impose shorter limits. Florida's is two years for most
welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
The Florida report, released Monday by Manpower Demonstration
Research Corp., offered a look into the future but did not measure
conclusively how people forced from the rolls are faring.
</P>
<P>
Florida officials and other supporters of time limits noted
that the study shows the limits didn't produce the positive effect
of getting people to move off the rolls voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
The program began in 1994 in Pensacola, near the Alabama
border. The first participants reached their time limit in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Only 11 percent of the Pensacola families actually hit the
limit after two years because, like families nationwide, they came
on and off the welfare rolls as their circumstances changed.
</P>
<P>
Time limits might have a greater effect on future recipients,
who will see that officials are serious about enforcing them,
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
Time limits aside, the program also offered welfare recipients
special services, such as more personal attention from caseworkers
and enhanced child care, and it let them keep more of the money
they earned while on welfare. It succeeded in increasing the
number of people who combined work with welfare.
</P>
<P>
Two years into the program, 52 percent of the people subject to
the new rules were working, compared with 44 percent in the
traditional program.
</P>
<P>
The two-year time limit applied only to recipients deemed most
likely to find work. Others facing tougher challenges got three
years. They hadn't hit the time limit in time to be studied.

<P>
BONN, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The German government on Monday said
that a possible revival in domestic investment along with
continued export boom is expected to enable the country to reach
the economic growth target of about 3.0 percent for 1998.
</P>
<P>
After a relatively flat period in the last quarter of 1997 when
the gross domestic product (GDP) grew just 0.5 percent over the
previous quarter, the economy was back to a clear upswing at the
start of the new year, said an economic report issued by the
German economics ministry on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Although industrial orders still came mainly from foreign
markets, domestic demand also saw a clear improvement recently,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also expected less job cuts during the course of
this year though average unemployment is set to remain at a
near-record high of 4.4 million.

<HEADLINE> World Trade Grows Up in 1997 Despite Asian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The volume of world merchandise
exports grew by 9.5 percent in 1997, the second highest rate
recorded in more than two decades, according to a report released
here Tuesday by the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
World output grew at three percent last year, matching the best
performance since 1989, WTO said in its first report on trade
developments last year and the outlook for this year.
</P>
<P>
Although trade prospects for 1998 remain clouded by uncertainty
over the impact of the Asian financial crisis, WTO said, global
trade expansion in 1998 would still be above the average rate
recorded for the first half of the 1990s even if merchandise trade
growth were to be reduced by as much as 25 percent of the 1997
rate.
</P>
<P>
WTO noted that much of the higher than expected trade growth in
1997 is attributable to the dynamism of economies in North America
and South America.
</P>
<P>
Both regions recorded a higher share in world trade than they
have attained in more than a decade. Some slowdown is expected in
these regions in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In value terms, merchandise exports amounted to 5.3 trillion
U.S. dollars and commercial services to 1.3 trillion dollars in
1997.
</P>
<P>
On the trade effects of the Asian financial crisis, WTO
believed that they will be felt most within the Asian region.
Because the affected countries, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines and South Korea, account for relatively small shares
of world output and trade (6-7 percent), the impact of the crisis
on trade will be limited.
</P>
<P>
Trade adjustment among the countries most affected by the Asian
crisis has largely been through import contraction so far, but
exports are likely to play a significant role in economic
recovery.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sends Envoy to Sell Peace Ideas to Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. special envoy Dennis Ross
will travel to the Middle East this week to revive the deadlocked
peace process by selling American ideas for a possible
breakthrough to both Israeli and Palestinian leaders, the State
Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Foley said the decision was
made by President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright to send Ross to the region to consult with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
"in order to finalize U.S. ideas."
</P>
<P>
Reports said the Clinton administration had proposed that
Israel make a gradual withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank
over 12 weeks, with each pullback met by Palestinian security
gestures.
</P>
<P>
Israel's cabinet rejected the U.S. initiative Sunday and
Netanyahu said Monday that the U.S. plan endangered Israel's
security.
</P>
<P>
"Israel is a tiny country and every piece of territory here is
tied to security," he said. "You can very quickly reach a
situation in which you endanger the security of the state, and I
will not do it."
</P>
<P>
Responding to the rejection by the Israeli cabinet of the U.S.
proposal, Foley said he did not believe the Israeli cabinet had
acted "on the basis of formal and final U.S. ideas."
</P>
<P>
He said Ross's mission to the region was to finalize the U.S.
ideas through consultation with both Israeli and Palestinian
leaders. And what the Israeli cabinet opposed was something of
press reporting, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about U.S. ideas.... And they are still in the
process of finalization," he said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Officials on Government Dismissal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Russian foreign policy will
not change after the government's resignation, Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He believed the dismissal of the government has nothing to do
with changes or prospects for changes in Russia's foreign policy,
because "the foreign policy implemented by the Russian Foreign
Ministry has been sanctioned by the president and is being carried
out under his supervision," added Primakov.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of whether he would be dismissed from the current
post he said this is premature, "If somebody wants this (the
minister's dismissal) very much, I will have to disappoint them
for the time-being".
</P>
<P>
Dismissed first deputy prime minister Anatoly Chubais told
reporters Monday that "I'm glad that the president has granted my
request for quitting the government service with which I addressed
him last month."
</P>
<P>
He said that the decision taken by president Boris Yeltsin to
dismiss the government has been prepared long. And he is sure the
government resignation would not alter the course of Russia's
reforms.
</P>
<P>
According to Chubais, he will still remain in the team of
Yeltsin regardless of in which capacity and where he works.
</P>
<P>
Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznyov said at a news briefing after
the government was dismissed that the government made serious
failures in its work.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chirac Raps Left in Intervening in Regional  Elections Turmoil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Monday evening condemned the far-right National Front (FN) as "a
racist and xenophobian party of nature" but accused the left of
being responsible for the rise of the FN in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
In a television speech to intervene in the turmoil in the
election of regional council presidents, Chirac said the left
should not "throw oil on fire."
</P>
<P>
"For a long time, some have never hesitated to play the game of
extreme right. It is because of this that the proportional voting
was adopted... and many seats were given to the left by the
National Front in the last legislative elections which clearly and
deliberately made the republican right fail at the profit of the
(left) majority," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
The late Socialist President Francois Mitterrand introduced the
proportional voting system to the regional elections in order to
let the FN have a foothold in the regions to weaken the mainstream
right.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two rightwing candidates who were elected to the
presidency of the regional councils in Haute Normandie and in
southern Midi-Pyrenees immediately resigned after winning the
election with the votes from FN deputies Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Socialists conquered the council of the key southern region
Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur Monday after FN president Jean-Marie Le
Pen failed to win support from the deputies of the rightwing RPR
and UDP.
</P>
<P>
The election of the Paris council is still going on in the
evening and the left is widely expected to win.

<HEADLINE> Annan Proposes Measures to Assist Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Monday proposed a comprehensive set of measures to
assist the government and people of Sierra Leone in both their
immediate and longer-term needs.
</P>
<P>
In his recent report to the Security Council, the
secretary-general recommended strengthening the office of his
special envoy in Freetown, and the possible deployment of human
rights observers in order to contribute to the restoration of
respect for the rule of law, civil order and human rights in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief is also considering attaching to the office two
civilian police officials to advise the government on police
training and procedures in a democratic society.
</P>
<P>
He recommended the deployment to Sierra Leone of up to 10
United Nations military liaison officers, whose functions would
be: to liaison closely with the Economic Community of West African
States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) and to report on the military
situation in the country; to ascertain the state of and to assist
the finalization of planning by the ECOMOG for future tasks.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the removal of the junta by the action of the ECOMOG
has opened the way for the re-establishment not just of the
legitimate government, but also of civil order, the democratic
process and the beginning of economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
He urged all member states to provide generous assistance to
the ECOMOG to enable it to meet its logistical requirements and to
fulfill its mandate in Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Urges France's Political Modernization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- After the election of regional
council presidents plunged France's political life into chaos,
President Jacques Chirac has urged the modernization of the
country's politics.
</P>
<P>
Chirac is clearly aiming to scrap the proportional system in
regional elections introduced by former President Francois
Mitterrand, who allowed the far-right National Front to get a
foothold in the regional councils to weaken the mainstream
rightwing parties.
</P>
<P>
The legislative election of France keeps the run-off voting
system which sees two top political leaders rival in one
constituency and leads to the production of a strong parliamentary
majority countered by a minority.
</P>
<P>
Under the proportional voting system, both the leftwing and the
rightwing can only win a relative majority in most regional
councils while the National Front can always play the role of
kingmaker in the election of council presidents.
</P>
<P>
As a result of this, some rightwing deputies have to solicit
support from the far right deputies to be elected to the
presidency of the councils.

<HEADLINE> Talks on Race Held in Denver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The advisory council for U.S.
President Bill Clinton's Initiative on Race is spending three days
in Denver, Colorado, to discuss racial stereotyping.
</P>
<P>
The seventh meeting for the initiative's advisory board is
overshadowed by criticism that some ethnic groups are not
represented.
</P>
<P>
Organizers hope the Denver meetings are less combative than
earlier sessions. An earlier discussion in San Jose, California,
was reduced to name-calling by a group that believed no
European-Americans -- or conservatives -- were represented.
</P>
<P>
But Initiative spokeswoman Lydia Sermons told United Press
International that former New Jersey Governor Thomas Keane, a
Republican, and former Republican vice presidential candidate Jack
Kemp serve on the board.
</P>
<P>
Native Americans are dissatisfied with the makeup of the board
and planned protests to draw attention to what some of them see as
an unbalanced dialogue.
</P>
<P>
A panel on Tuesday's agenda includes a Native American from
Wisconsin, Sermons said.
</P>
<P>
The meetings will concentrate on the impact racial stereotypes
have had on lives and how to reduce stereotyping's impact has on
race relations.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sees no Change in Russian Policies Despite Reshuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Monday that It does not believe Russian President Boris Yeltsin's
reshuffle of the cabinet signals a shift away from the partnership
U.S. President Bill Clinton has been attempting to build with
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the general direction of policy will be
unaffected by this," Clinton told reporters in Ghana, the first
stop of his six-nation Africa tour.
</P>
<P>
"I have no reason to believe that anything different will occur
in a way that's at all adverse to the partnership we've been
building with Russia," he added.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Foley said Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright will hold a previously arranged meeting Tuesday
with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov in Bonn and will
discuss with him the implications of the change in government.
</P>
<P>
Albright and Primakov will be in Bonn for a meeting of the
Contact Group on the former Yugoslavia, which also groups Britain,
Germany, France and Italy, to discuss crisis in Kosovo. Foley also
shrugged off the shakeup's significance, saying, "This is
something that happens in democracies from time to time." The
announcement, he said, does not necessarily presage "any change
in Russia's basic orientation, either in terms of domestic
economic reform or cooperation with the international community."

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
CyberSchoolBus, an Internet-based online educational service of
the Department of Public Information, has designed a special
project to compile a global atlas of student actions in the field
of human rights.
</P>
<P>
The project has been formed in honor of the 50th anniversary
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
The project, "Human Rights in Action," focuses on student
actions. It aims to demonstrate that young people are actively
concerned about the human rights situation in various parts of the
world, that the notion of rights has relevance everywhere in the
world and that young students can indeed make a difference about
change.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. CyberSchoolBus would like to collect stories of
classes or schools defending and promoting human rights in their
own communities, neighborhoods and cities. By compiling these
stories of student actions, it hopes to create a global resource
that will provide concrete examples to emulate and inspire new and
original actions.

<HEADLINE> European Shares down on Weak Dow, Concern on Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
Monday were driven in opposite directions, boosted by strong gains
in oil stocks but depressed by a weak Dow and Russia's political
upheaval, with major indice ending down slightly.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE 100 index of leading shares had earlier rallied
above the key 6,000-point level, lifted by massive gains in oil
stocks, but failed to sustain the level later and closed slightly
lower, down 9.3 points or 0.16 percent at 5,947.0, undermined by a
weaker Dow.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that oil shares provided a safety net for leading
shares that would otherwise have followed Wall Street into the
red.
</P>
<P>
An urge to consolidate dramatic gains seen since the start of
the year took the index off highs, and Monday's news that Russian
President Yeltsin had dissolved his whole government also caused
concern.
</P>
<P>
The Paris CAC-40 index closed down 8.78 points or 0.24 percent
at 3,680.13 in a wave of profit-taking ahead of the monthly
settlement on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
There had been a lot of profit-taking among banking shares,
dealers said. And in the absence of new broker share-price
targets, investors felt disinclined to buy.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, Germany's blue-chip DAX-30 index also closed
weaker after setting a fresh record high earlier, down 30.23
points or 0.60 percent at 4971.32.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said investors were concerned about instability in
eastern Europe and the proximity of Russian borders rather than
that any trade would be lost.

<HEADLINE> Russian Officials on Government Dismissal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Russian foreign policy will
not change after the government's resignation, Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He believed the dismissal of the government has nothing to do
with changes or prospects for changes in Russia's foreign policy,
because "the foreign policy implemented by the Russian Foreign
Ministry has been sanctioned by the president and is being carried
out under his supervision," added Primakov.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of whether he would be dismissed from the current
post he said this is premature, "If somebody wants this (the
minister's dismissal) very much, I will have to disappoint them
for the time-being".
</P>
<P>
Dismissed first deputy prime minister Anatoly Chubais told
reporters Monday that "I'm glad that the president has granted my
request for quitting the government service with which I addressed
him last month."
</P>
<P>
He said that the decision taken by president Boris Yeltsin to
dismiss the government has been prepared long. And he is sure the
government resignation would not alter the course of Russia's
reforms.
</P>
<P>
According to Chubais, he will still remain in the team of
Yeltsin regardless of in which capacity and where he works.
</P>
<P>
Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznyov said at a news briefing after
the government was dismissed that the government made serious
failures in its work.
</P>
<P>
The wage debt to state employees has been accumulating since
the start of 1998 and the obligations that the government
undertook proved unfeasible, Seleznyov noted.
</P>
<P>
The government resignation was long overdue, Communist Party

<HEADLINE> Greece to Advise Cyprus Problem to Be Brought Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Greece Monday said it would
propose that the Cyprus problem be brought up before the U.N.
Security Council if the Turkish Cypriots could not change its
"negative stance" towards the settlement of the issue.
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Undersecretary Yiannos Kranidiotis made the
statement after meeting with U.N. special adviser on Cyprus Diego
Cordovez here Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said Greece had proposed to Cordovez that if the Turkish
side's negative stand continued, the Cyprus issue should be
brought before the U.N. Security Council which in turn would
undertake its responsibility in order to strengthen the effort for
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Such dialogue could operate in parallel with Cyprus' accession
talks with the European Union (EU), he added.
</P>
<P>
He described the terms set by the Turkish Cypriots to
participate in the dialogue with the Greek Cypriots as
unacceptable, saying that the Turkish side should attend the
dialogue with no preconditions.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Cordovez hoped that the negotiations would
proceed for a settlement of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
He would brief U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan on the matters
raised by Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash and if instructed to, he would go to Cyprus
again to continue consultations, Cordovez said.
</P>
<P>
He said that efforts were being made for a meeting between
Annan and Denktash which was expected to take place in Geneva this
week.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops occupied
the northern third of the island in the wake of an abortive coup
backed by Athens.
</P>
<P>
Denktash said recently that negotiations between Cyprus' two
communities were "off." He reiterated his demand that northern
Cyprus, which unilaterally declared independent in 1983 and has
been recognized only by Turkey, be recognized by the international
community.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez, who arrived here Monday from Nicosia on a mission to
achieve resumption of Cyprus peace talks, will fly to Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Deutsche Bank to Give Holocaust Groups Money from  Gold Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frankfurt, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Germany's largest commercial
bank Deutsche Bank said Monday it would offer Holocaust groups 5.6
million marks (3.06 million U.S. dollars) it gained from sale of
Nazi-era gold of doubtful origin.
</P>
<P>
The money came from the bank's 1995 sale of 323 kilograms of
gold, which it had owned at the end of the World War II.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, it contributed the proceeds to Holocaust
groups because it could not rule out the possibility that the gold
was stolen by the Nazis from Jews.
</P>
<P>
The bank said it found the gold when reviewing its wartime gold
transactions following public discussion of the whereabouts of the
stolen Jewish assets.
</P>
<P>
The proceeds from the bank's gold sale are expected to be
shared equally between the World Jewish Restitution Organization,
which provides assistance to Holocaust survivors, and the March of
the Living Foundation, which organizes annual visits to the former
Nazi death camp at Auschwitz.

UNITED NATIONS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- "The tragedy of
Afghanistan continues as the factions, supported by the
uninterrupted supply of arms from outside, keeping fighting in
defiance of the will of the vast majority of the Afghan people,"
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in his report released on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign interference by countries in the region and beyond in
the form of active political and military support of one faction
or another reinforces the reluctance of the faction leaders to
engage in serious political dialogue with one another and remains
a major cause of the prolonged turmoil on Afghanistan," the
Secretary-General said.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief called for a "hard look" at the external aspects
of the problem, saying the countries concerned must make genuine
efforts to agree on measures to curb the flow of arms to te
country.
</P>
<P>
"I am obliged to repeat the plea already made so many times by
my predecessors and me: that Member States concerned should heed
the wish of the ever more desperate Afghan people that they cease
supply war-making materials to the Afghan factions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan reported a new spirit of cooperation between Iran and
Pakistan which offers promise on the regional front, noting the
two countries had together sponsored a resolution on Afghanistan
at the lasting meeting of the Organization of te Islamic
Conference.
