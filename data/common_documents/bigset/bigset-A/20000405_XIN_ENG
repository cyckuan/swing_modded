<HEADLINE> ASEAN Environment Minister Meet in Brunei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 4 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN environment ministers met
at an informal setting Tuesday in Brunei Darussalam and discussed
a wide range of issues regarding ASEAN environment cooperation,
said a joint press statement reaching here this evening.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the ministers exchanged views on haze
related matters, adopted the ASEAN Strategic Plan of Action on
Environment (SPAE), attended the launch of the ASEAN Environment
Year (AEY) 2000, reviewed the progress of the preparation of the
ASEAN State of the Environment Report (SoER) 2000 and discussed
upcoming environmental events at the regional and global levels.
</P>
<P>
The statement said AEY 2000 stressed the importance of raising
public awareness on environmental matters and called for efforts
to educate and inculcate the public with the right concept of
environment protection, proper resources utilization as well as on
minimizing waste while the SPAE consists of the key activities to
be implemented over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of trans-boundary haze, the statement said, the
ministers held that the haze in Sumatra and Kalimantan in March
was caused mainly by land clearing by some plantation companies
and the ministers expressed strong objection to such irresponsible
behavior.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed to take all possible measures to deal with
the culprits and to enforce the zero-burning policy, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the ministers also discussed cooperation in the

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka, Norway Sign Deal On Deportation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 4 (Xinhua) - Sri Lanka and Norway have signed an
agreement under which the Scandinavian country would deport Sri
Lankans who do not have valid authorization of residency, the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"This agreement signals Norway's intention to repatriate failed
asylum-seekers and reflects the improvement in the human rights
situation in Sri Lanka," the ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Sri Lankans, mostly minority Tamils, leave their
war-torn country every year to seek asylum in Europe due to the
ongoing ethnic war between government troops and the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) who have been fighting a war for a
separate homeland for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and
east for 17 years.
</P>
<P>
Norway has been host to a sizeable Sri Lankan Tamil expatriate
or refugee population since the war started in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Norway, having carved a niche for itself in resolving
international conflicts, said earlier this year that it would work
to bring the government and the LTTE to the negotiating table in
an attempt to end the bloody war which has claimed more than 55,
000 lives.
</P>
<P>
The deportation deal came as Germany was speeding procedures to
deport some 5,500 Sri Lankan nationals whose asylum requests had
been rejected.
</P>
<P>
Last month, 20 Sri Lankans were sent back to Colombo from
Germany on a special flight chartered by the German government.
</P>
<P>
German embassy officials here said another Sri Lankan national
is expected to be deported on Thursday by Germany which with some
60,000 people of Sri Lankan origin deported 150 people last year
in small numbers.

<HEADLINE> ADB Attaches Importance to Bangladesh in War Against Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Poverty Reduction Partnership
Agreement signed between the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the
Government of Bangladesh Monday signifies the great importance the
ADB attaches to the country in implementing its new Poverty
Reduction Strategy, the bank's head said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Briefing newsmen here, visiting ADB President Tadao Chino noted
that over the 27 years since the country joined the ADB in 1973,
the bank has extended 132 loans to Bangladesh, totaling nearly 6
billion U.S. dollars, and grants for 257 technical assistance
projects, totaling 156 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The relationship has been raised to a higher level with the
signing of the Poverty Reduction Partnership Agreement, the ADB
President said, adding that "we now see Bangladesh as a front-line
state in the war against poverty."
</P>
<P>
Tadao Chino pointed out that subject to ADB's resource
availability and the progress of policy and institutional reforms
in Bangladesh,ADB's assistance package could amount to a total of
up to 500 million dollars per year for specific sectors like
agriculture and rural development, primary health and nutrition,
basic education, water resource management, road and rail
transportation, power and energy,urban development and the
financial sector.
</P>
<P>
ADB is committed to further strengthen the development
partnership it share with Bangladesh "for our overarching goal of
poverty reduction," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ADB head stressed that the bank's assistance will promote
the three pillars of it's poverty reduction strategy: pro-poor
economic growth, social development and good governance.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Builds Outlet Highways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Land-locked Ethiopia is trying
to build road linkage with ports of neighboring countries, an
official of the Ethiopian Road Authority (ERA) has said.
</P>
<P>
The highways that link Ethiopia to ports of Djibouti, Berbera
and Sudan are either maintained or under construction, the latest
issue of magazine Efoyta quoted Debebe Gizaw, information and
public relations service manager with the ERA as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia accessed the Djibouti port through two highways and a
railway, Debebe said, adding the 40-kilometer Gelafe-Boke road was
under maintenance at a cost of over 4.4 million birr (about
500,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The 185-kilometer Gondar-Metema road, which gives Ethiopia an
easy access to the Port Sudan, has completed 115 kilometers, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The European Union was finalizing its study on the construction
of the Harar-Jijiga-Wuchale road leading to the port of Berbera,
Somalia, he added.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Iraqi Accusations of Mistreating POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi on Wednesday dismissed as groundless an Iraqi
claim that Iraqi prisoners of war (POWs) are mistreated in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Despite the clear evidence showing Iranian POW's being
mistreated in Iraqi camps, Iran has always adopted the most humane
and respectful behavior toward Iraqi prisoners held in the country,
Asefi was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein recently accused Iran of
mistreating Iraqi POWs held since the bloody war from 1980 to 1988
which killed about 1 million people, IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
At a time when Iran is on the brink of releasing a large number
of Iraqi POWs, the Iraqi president made such baseless accusations,
Asefi regretted.
</P>
<P>
He said as a humanitarian action and a sign of good will, Iran
in cooperation with the International Committee of the Red Cross is
going to set free 2,000 Iraqi POWs next Friday.
</P>
<P>
The obstructive measures taken by Iraqi authorities have
protracted the process of swapping the POWs, he added.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Iraqi government to take an appropriate
initiative in solving the issue of POWs of both countries instead
of leveling baseless allegations.
</P>
<P>
Iran claimed last month that Iraq still holds 2,800 Iranians
according to available documents, in spite of the Iraqi claim that
it has repatriated all Iranian POWs.
</P>
<P>
Last August, Iranian officials said that Iran had released 55,
438 Iraqi POWs since 1981 on 103 occasions while Iraq had freed 39,
417 Iranian POWs in the same period on 70 occasions.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Turkish Ruling Coalition Backs Away From Presidency Extension (By Xing Guoxin, Huai Chengbo) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish coalition government
later Wednesday gave up a constitutional reform bill aimed to
extend President Suleyman Demirel's term in office after it failed
to pass the parliament for a second time in the day.
</P>
<P>
The coalition government decided to withdrawal the bill, which
called for reducing the presidential tenure from seven years to
five years but allowing for re-election, before a third and final
vote.
</P>
<P>
The bill, promoted by Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit's ruling
coalition, suffered another defeat in the second vote with only 303
deputies' approval, the same as the score seven days ago.
</P>
<P>
A minimum of 330 votes in the 550-seat parliament are required
for the legislature's approval of any constitutional amendment
proposal and 367 votes are needed to secure the adoption of the
proposal without a national referendum.
</P>
<P>
Like what happened seven days ago, the defeat was largely due to
defections of many deputies from Ecevit's ruling partner Motherland
Party who have been against the extension of president's tenure.
</P>
<P>
Before the voting, Ecevit called on maverick deputies to cast
their secret votes in open to back up their promise to pave the way
for Demirel's re-election.
</P>
<P>
The result indicated, however, some 100 deputies of the ruling
parties voted against the bill, probably the same as those who
voted against it in the secret ballot last week despite their
earlier written endorsement.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit had argued that the re-election of Demirel, whose tenure
expires on May 16, was crucial for the stability in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister feared that dissent among ruling parties over
Demirel's successor could hamper the government's economic reform
package and much-needed political stability at a time when Turkey
is striving for membership of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Demirel has failed to draw enough support from the deputies who
say that the country's political stability cannot be linked to one
old person and that it is time for him to retire from politics.
</P>
<P>
Demirel, 76, has been active in Turkish politics for almost 40
years. Many see him as the symbol of immobility in Turkish politics
and favor new faces.
</P>
<P>
The ruling parties said Monday after a meeting of leaders of the
three coalition partners that failure to pass the constitutional
amendment will not represent a crisis for the government.
</P>
<P>
But analysts said that the coalition partners will face a
different problem as the search for a new president candidate
begins.

<HEADLINE> PNTR Critical for U.S. Business and Workers, Chamber Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States Chamber of
Commerce said on Wednesday that the Clinton administration's trade
deal with China is "critical" to American businesses and workers,
and Congressmen should pass Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR)
when it comes up for a vote late this year.
</P>
<P>
"This vote is not about politics it's about paychecks. PNTR
for China means more jobs at better wages for American workers,"
said Bruce Josten, Chamber Executive Vice President.
</P>
<P>
"A vote against PNTR is a vote against giving American
businesses, workers and farmers access to 1.2 billion Chinese
consumers," he added.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States reached an agreement on WTO last
November, which would lower China's trade tariffs dramatically and
open its telecommunications, insurance, banking and securities
markets for the first time to foreign competitors.
</P>
<P>
"China will enter the World Trade Organization without regard
to our action on their trading status, but unless we grant China
PNTR, we will not receive the benefits of our own trade agreement
 but our foreign competitors will," Josten said.
</P>
<P>
Recent surveys show that the trade deal would boost annual U.S.
exports by roughly 13 billion U.S. dollars in five years and
increase agricultural exports by 2.2 billion per year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business
federation representing more than three million businesses and
organizations, has launched a nationwide grassroots initiative,
Trade Roots, to educate local leaders and the public about the
importance of international trade to local communities. Trade
Roots currently is working hard to mobilize support for U.S.-China
WTO agreement and the PNTR vote.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) on
Wednesday lauded House Speaker Dennis Hastert for scheduling a
vote on China PNTR for the week of May 22, calling it "a smart and
critical step".
</P>
<P>
"The speaker's leadership in putting this historic vote above
partisan politics is very important to getting China PNTR through
the House," and "holding the vote that week will enable us to
build bipartisan support before the turmoil of the election season
takes over," NAM President Jerry Jasinowski said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Congressional passage of PNTR is of great concern
to America's manufacturers, particularly NAM's small- and medium-
sized firms which account for 82 percent of U.S. companies that
export to China.
</P>
<P>
"Without PNTR, the more open trade that China has promised will
not be available to the thousands of U.S. manufacturers and
employees who want to sell into this market," Jasinowski said on
Monday at a NAM news conference with House Majority leader Dick
Armey.
</P>
<P>
That market, however, will be open to America's competitors in
Europe and Japan, he added.
</P>
<P>
The NAM is America's largest and oldest multi-industry trade
association, composed of 14,000 members, including 10,000 small-
and mid-sized companies, and 350 member associations serving
manufacturers and employees in every industrial sector and all 50
states.

<HEADLINE> Mandelson Urges IRA to Show Positive Signs on Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Northern Ireland
Secretary Peter Mandelson said on Wednesday that he hoped for
progress in the peace process by Easter (April 23).
</P>
<P>
He told the British parliament's Northern Ireland Select
Committee that the British and Irish governments, co-sponsors of
the peace process, were working hard to come up with some sort of
blueprint to help get the province's stalled peace process back on
track.
</P>
<P>
"I think it might be possible...to elicit a response from the
IRA in the coming weeks. But I don't think Easter will be the
finishing line for those discussions," Mandelson said.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of decommissioning must be addressed," Mandelson
said. "People still live under the threat of violence. The guns
may be silent but they have not yet been put beyond use.
</P>
<P>
He also admitted that the prospects for full decommissioning by
May 22 were poor.
</P>
<P>
In Belfast, pro-British Protestant leader David Trimble warned
that if the arms impasse was not soon resolved, political progress
in Northern Ireland could be delayed for years.
</P>
<P>
Trimble told an Ulster Unionist women's conference on Wednesday
he believed the opportunity for progress still existed, but would
not remain for long.
</P>
<P>
The April 1998 Good Friday peace Agreement could go into cold
storage if there is no movement on the arms issue, he added.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't resolve differences before May 22 or before the
summer, then we are going to have problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Unless the decommissioning (disarmament) issue is resolved
with clarity and certainty in the next few weeks, I fear the
chances of political agreement in Northern Ireland might be
postponed for several years," Trimble told the conference.
</P>
<P>
The province's move away from 30 years of sectarian violence to
a lasting peace has stumbled since Mandelson suspended a fledgling
power-sharing executive in February.
</P>
<P>
Britain said the Irish Republican Army's failure to give a
clear commitment to hand in arms in line with the landmark Good
Friday peace agreement left it with no choice.
</P>
<P>
London and Dublin are struggling to find ways of reviving the
political institutions by May 22, which the 1998 agreement set as
the date for a completion of an arms handover.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Mitchel McLaughlin and Bairbre de
Brun from Sinn Fein, the political wing of IRA, will lead a
delegation to lobby MPs in London on Thursday ahead of a half-day
Westminster debate on the reform of the Royal Ulster Constabulary
(RUC).
</P>
<P>
An Ulster Unionist motion will be debated which urges the
British government to retain the RUC name and symbols and attempt
to persuade it to postpone the sweeping reforms recommended in the
Patten Report on future of policing.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Warns Mission in Haiti Short of Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Wednesday informed the United Nations General Assembly
that the resources for the International Civilian Support Mission
In Haiti (MICAH) are insufficient.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the United Nations General Assembly, Annan said
no contributions have been received to date for the Trust Fund of
MICAH.
</P>
<P>
As a result, human rights and law and order activities, which
were to have been covered by voluntary contributions, cannot be
carried out, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Annan suggested that the Assembly consider closing the mission
and transferring its substantive activities to the U.N.
Development Program, rather than "preserving a presence in Haiti
which has only core staff and is unable to carry out the envisaged
activities in the areas of justice, human rights and police."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief also noted that the increasing tendency for the
United Nations to be "given mandates without the necessary
financial resources."
</P>
<P>
The mission began its mandate on March 16 with only core staff,
whose costs are covered through regular budgetary resources.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Kenya Takes Actions to Curb Road Accidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Li Jinqi
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Following Kenya's worst road
accident in which 76 people were killed last week, the Kenyan
government have taken swift actions to curb such road carnage and
save the peoples' lives.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, two buses collided head-on on the
Nakuru-Kericho road in western Kenya, with one of the bus turned
into a fireball, as a result of overloading and overspeeding.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi last Thursday ordered the
police to set up road blocks for immediate crackdown on overloaded
buses and mutatus (mini-bus) to minimize road accidents and ensure
drivers are prosecuted to deter them from violating traffic laws
without punishment.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that his government could not sit back and watch
Kenyans lose their lives because of reckless driving and lack of
action.
</P>
<P>
Moi also directed the Ministry of Roads and Public Works to
repair accident black spots and expand the sections of the highway
to give drivers a clear view of the road ahead.
</P>
<P>
In Kenya, recklessness, overloading and speeding by drivers of
public service vehicles are the major factors behind the rising
accident rates.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported that in the past two weeks alone, more
than 100 Kenyans have perished in road accidents.
</P>
<P>
It is a common scene in the capital Nairobi that the overpacked
matatus always overtake other vehicles regardless of traffic laws
and regulations.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan police across the country have swiftly responded to
Moi's instruction and placed road blocks on all major roads to
crack down on unroadworthy vehicles and those overloading and
speeding buses.
</P>
<P>
In Western Province where the bus collusion occurred, traffic
police on Monday alone impounded over 80 vehicles and arrested 25
drivers for overloading and speeding and other traffic offence.
</P>
<P>
While traffic police in Central Province have impounded 400
vehicles and arrested 243 drivers in the ongoing crackdown, which
began four days ago.
</P>
<P>
Justus Mwangi, traffic police officer in Western Province, said
the drivers netted in the crackdown operation would be charged
with overloading and speeding.
</P>
<P>
He warned that drivers or passengers who attempt to give
bribes to police officers will be apprehended on the spot, and
police officers who allow any overloaded vehicles to pass will
risk losing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Police Commissioner Philemon Abong'o has ordered that
road signs be put up on the spot where two buses collided head-on
to caution drivers against overloading and speeding.
</P>
<P>
The police boss also urged local inspectors to conduct public
lectures on traffic code in schools and other institutions with a
view to enlightening the public in the respect.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the crackdown would continue until
discipline and sanity are restored on the roads.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the International Federation of Red
Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Kenya is ranked among the top
six countries in the world with highest rate of road accidents.
</P>
<P>
The agency estimates that road accidents cost Kenya between 55
million to 70 million U.S. dollars annually although other
researchers put the loss at twice these figures.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Defends Farm Allocations to Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Wednesday defended the issue of some senior officials in his
government acquiring farms, after British Foreign Minister of
State Peter Hain accused him of allocating land to "his cronies".
</P>
<P>
Mugabe told Zimbabwean reporters during a stop-over in Nairobi
on his return from the Africa-European Union summit in Cairo that
the number of ministers in his cabinet was so insignificant that
even if they all got farms under the land reform program this
would not make any impact on the program.
</P>
<P>
"Hain repeated that I was giving land to my 'cronies'. I said
my cabinet has only 23 ministers. Even if each one of them had
land they could not be in possession of the five million hectares
that the government intends to acquire for resettlement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Most of Zimbabwe's 12 million hectares of best farm land is
owned by 4, 000 whites.
</P>
<P>
Mines, Environment and Tourism Minister Simon Khaya Moyo and
Deputy Transport and Energy Minister Zenzo Nsimbi are among the
people that recently handed back their farms at the height of
adverse publicity pointing out that the properties were being
allocated to undeserving people.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers said they were withdrawing their applications
for those farms as they were closer to the communal lands.
</P>
<P>
The government recently came up with a policy decision that
farms close to communal lands should be used to resettle landless
people in those areas.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Civic Groups Concerned Over Rising Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's various civic groups on
Wednesday expressed concern over the upsurge in political violence
and urged political leaders to use their powers to curb
lawlessness.
</P>
<P>
The Legal Resources Foundation condemned the clash that erupted
last weekend in Harare between ex-combatants and demonstrators of
the National Constitutional Assembly.
</P>
<P>
It said: "The conduct of attackers, the slow reaction of the
riot police and their selective use of their powers of arrest are
examples of the breakdown of the rule of law in Zimbabwe."
</P>
<P>
The government and President Robert Mugabe should condemn the
violence, it added.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the National Business Forum said in a statement that
violence would tarnish the domestic and international image of the
country.
</P>
<P>
They said there was need to stop the "senseless violence" to
enable Zimbabwe to hold fair parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
"As business people, we find the prevalence of violence and
lawlessness having the potential to negate the efforts being made
by both the government and the business to create an environment
for national consensus building which will result in attracting
investment and lead to economic growth," they said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Movement for Democratic Change also condemned
the violence that has been going on in the past weeks, but also
raised concern over lack of police intervention.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that more than 120 people have been arrested in
almost 40 cases of recent political violence, which has left two
people dead and 100 others injured.

<HEADLINE> Life Imprisonment for Accessaries in Iranian General Assassination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Intelligence Ministry said
Wednesday two Iranians were sentenced to life imprisonment for
helping military opposition group to assassinate former Vice Chief
of the Joint Staff of Iranian armed forces Ali Sayyad Shirazi.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that Nassir Hussein Sharifat and Abdulzahra
Tamimi had been arrested by the ministry's forces and confessed to
their role in helping the Mujaheddin Khalq Organization (MKO) to
cross into Iran to assassinate Shirazi.
</P>
<P>
The two men had been working with the Iraqi intelligence agency
in cross border sabotage against Iran and had crossed the border
into and from Iran several times, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
They helped two assassins sneak into Iran who assassinated
Shirazi on April 10, 1999, the ministry said, giving no date of
their arrest and trial.
</P>
<P>
Shirazi was gunned down in front of his house in northern Tehran
by the assassins disguised as city street cleaners. The MKO soon
claimed responsibility for the killing.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq-based MKO said that Shirazi was targeted because he was
responsible for purging and executing military personnel, and
responsible for the death of hundreds of thousands of teenagers in
the war with Iraq (1980-88).
</P>
<P>
Shirazi, born in 1944, served as commander of the Iranian army's
ground forces during the Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
The MKO was a main political group which had fought against the
former Iranian shah regime, but it was outlawed in 1981 due to
sharp difference with the then Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
During the past decades, the MKO launched various attacks on
Iranian interests inside and outside Iran. In retaliation, the
Iranian armed forces also bombed the MKO bases in Iraq several
times.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Foreign Minister to Visit Egypt Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said Wednesday that his Syrian counterpart Faruq Shareh will visit
Cairo early next week to discuss the latest developments in the
Mideast peace march, especially on the Syria track.
</P>
<P>
Shareh was to have paid the visit on Wednesday, but his trip was
delayed due to Egypt's busy schedule for the first Africa-Europe
summit attended by leaders of 67 African and European Union
countries, Moussa told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The postponement was reportedly decided during a phone call
Tuesday night between the two ministers.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Egyptian Information Ministry said Shareh's trip
had been called off but gave no details.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak reportedly telephoned his
Syrian counterpart Hafez al-Assad on Tuesday, discussing
developments in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
After meeting United States President Bill Clinton in Washington
at the end of March, Mubarak said he planned to contribute to
efforts to unblock the Syrian-Israeli negotiations and that he
could soon meet Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
The statement followed the failure of the March 26 U.S.-Syrian
summit in Geneva aimed at revitalizing the Syrian-Israeli talks,
which have been stalled since January due to disputes over Israeli
full withdrawal from the Golan Heights that Israel seized from
Syria in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
Chances of resuming the negotiations were hit by the failure of
the Geneva summit. Israel has confirmed its intention to pull its
troops out of south Lebanon, even without an agreement with Lebanon
or Syria. Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, has some 35,000
troops in Lebanon.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 5 (Xinhua) - United Nations Secretary General Kofi
Annan's envoy Rord Larsen Wednesday held talks with Lebanese
President Emile Lahoud over the future of south Lebanon against the
backdrop of upcoming Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Larson, who arrived here in the afternoon for a two-day visit,
has a plan to meet with Lebanese leaders and brief them of the
results of the talks between Kofi Annan and Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Larsen delivered Annan's news statement to Lahoud, which was
released in Geneva Tuesday after his meeting with Levy and
mentioned Israel's resolve to fulfill a withdrawal from south
Lebanon and cooperate with United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Larsen said Annan is waiting for a formal reply from Lebanon
concerning Israel's offer.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud issued a memorandum after his talks with Larsen,
condemning Israel's ferocity over Lebanon since 1978 and voicing
doubt about the Jewish country's real intention of the pullout.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that Palestinian guerrillas will continue
attacks on Israel after its unilateral withdrawal, indicating that
the Lebanese government can not entirely control Palestinian
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
There are some 370, 000 Palestinian refugees living in Lebanon
since the founding of Israel and the first Middle East war in 1948.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has repeatedly reiterated that Palestinian refugees
should return home while Israel has rejected the request.

<HEADLINE> Finding Confirms Severe Loss of Ozone In Arctic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Ozone have lost more than 60
percent in the Arctic stratosphere near 18-kilometer altitude
during one of the coldest stratospheric winters on record, the
European Commission confirmed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the most substantial ozone losses at this
altitude in the Arctic, the European Union (EU)'s executive arm
said in a statement when releasing a research finding conducted by
European and American scientists.
</P>
<P>
"Measurements from the largest international campaign ever
investigating stratospheric ozone depletion have provided more
insight into the processes that control stratospheric ozone,"the
Commission said.
</P>
<P>
"They have also reinforced concerns that the Arctic ozone may
continue to decline despite the benefits of reductions in
stratospheric chlorine levels due to the global climate change."
</P>
<P>
EU research commissioner Philippe Busquin said EU researchers
and an American team demonstrate "how important it is for Europe
to create a European Research Area where the best European
scientists collaborate in a network".
</P>
<P>
"This project will provide decision makers with a sound base to
judge the effects of ozone depletion on the environment and on
citizen's health," he said.

<P>
LUANDA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Security Council is
considering taking punitive measures against the countries proved
to have violated the sanctions on the rebel National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Local informed sources on Wednesday quoted Chairman of the U.N.

Canada proposed that the Security Council examine the issue
after a six- month study on whether the countries that allegedly
violated the sanctions have taken the necessary measures to avoid
repetition, he said.
</P>
<P>
The special report released last month by the U.N. sanctions
committee accused Togo, Burkina Faso, Rwanda, among others, of
breaching the U.N. sanctions meant to cut off military supplies to

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Completes Privatization of Power Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia on Wednesday
announced the completion of the full privatization of its power
sector by establishing the Saudi Electricity Company (SEC), a 9
billion-U.S. dollar group in which the government owns 50 percent
of the shares.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Commerce Minister Osama Faqih said the SEC was formed by a
merger of 10 regional electrical companies, the Saudi Press Agency
monitored here reported.
</P>
<P>
Faqih said the Riyadh-based SEC will generate, transform and
distribute electricity in Saudi Arabia, as well as selling and
purchasing energy service.
</P>
<P>
It will also take part and invest in domestic and foreign energy
ventures, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi government decided to privatize the electricity sector
and establish the new company last November, hoping it would "
provide best services to its clients according to the accredited
technical standards and with the least cost."
</P>
<P>
The electricity sector is the second public sector to be
privatized by Riyadh, after it privatized the communications sector
in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
Since early 1996, when Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz entrusted,
after suffering a stroke, his half-brother Crown Prince Abdullah
Ibn Abdul-Aziz to take charge of the country's daily affairs, the
Gulf kingdom has been striving to diversify its oil economy and
encourage a greater role of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The private sector grew by a moderate 2.4 percent last year,
slightly higher than the 2.12-percent growth in 1998. Its
contribution to the Saudi gross domestic product (GDP) was
estimated at 38 percent.

<HEADLINE> 55 Tons of Narcotics Seized in Iran's Khorasan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Over 55 tons of narcotics were
seized in Iran's northeastern province of Khorasan during the past
Iranian calendar year which ended March 19, Commander of the
Provincial Security Forces Bahram Norouzi said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The consignment, which was seized during 272-day operations,
represented an increase of 8.7 percent from the previous year,
Norouzi told the Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Five tons of the haul was heroin while the rest was opium, he
said, adding that 285 traffickers were killed in armed clashes, 515
injured while 33 Iranian anti-drug personnel lost their lives.
</P>
<P>
During the year, 8,747 smugglers, 423 distributors and dealers
and 21,119 addicts were also arrested in the province which border
Afghanistan, the world's largest drug producing center, he added.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Vice President for Executive Affairs Mohammad Hashemi
said on Monday that Iran confiscated over 253 tons of different
kinds of narcotics in 1999, including six tons of heroin, 22 tons
of morphine, 204 tons of opium, 18 tons of hashish and three tons
of others.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to foreign envoys based in Tehran, he called for
international cooperation among world countries to help Iran in its
campaigns against drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Iran is a main transit route for drugs smuggled from
Afghanistan, the world's largest opium producer, and neighboring
Pakistan to Europe and oil-rich Gulf Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Iran started harsh anti-drug campaigns in 1989 after the Iranian
Majlis or parliament passed an anti-drug law authorizing capital
punishment for drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that some 2900 anti-drug forces have been killed in
operations since the Islamic revolution in 1979.

<HEADLINE> Britain Fines Truck Drivers for Stowaways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Sixteen illegal immigrants were
found in trucks and the drivers fined 32,000 pounds (51,000 U.S.
dollars) in the first three days of a British crackdown on
stowaways, the Home Office said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"As per my latest information, there have been four trucks
found with 16 clandestine entrants aboard," a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Home Office declined to give the nationalities of the
immigrants, who were detained, or of the drivers.
</P>
<P>
They were the first drivers to be punished under the
Immigration and Asylum Act passed last year, which imposed a 2,000
pound (3,200 dollar) penalty for each person arriving without the
correct papers.
</P>
<P>
The fines were introduced by the government in an attempt to
force lorry drivers to tighten up security and search their
vehicles before boarding cross-Channel ferris.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown on asylum seekers follows a vitriolic press
campaign and opposition charges that the Labor government has been
soft on immigration.
</P>
<P>
Other measures include plans to scatter immigrants across the
country and pay refugees a living allowance in shopping vouchers
rather than in cash.
</P>
<P>
Britain received 71,160 asylum applications in 1999, the second
highest tally in the European Union after Germany which had 95,115.
</P>
<P>
The largest group coming to Britain were 11,465 applicants from
the former Yugoslavia. Asylum seekers from Somalia and Sri Lanka
were the next most numerous -- 7,495 and 5,130 respectively in
1999.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Appeals to Assist Climate Disaster In Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has
launched an "Inter-Agency Appeal for Mongolia 'Dzud 2000', An
evolving Disaster," to address the ongoing climate disaster in the
country, A U.N. release said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This "multiple dzud" is the cumulative result of last summer's
drought, a winter which began in September and has been the
coldest for 30 years, repetitive heavy snowstorms and years of
pastoral degradation.
</P>
<P>
 Over 1.8 million head of livestock, including sheep, goats,
cattle, horses and camels, have perished this winter, and half a
million of the country's population is directly concerned.
</P>
<P>
 Nomadic herdsmen make up the majority of the population of
Mongolia, and animal husbandry is the staple source of economy.
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations appeal for 3 million U.S. dollars, issued
in response to the Government of Mongolia's appeal for
international assistance on February 11, focuses on replacement of
livestock, on the provision of food, a safe water supply and
irrigation for pasture land, and on rehabilitation of the health
and education sectors.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Says World Makes Little Progress On Low Birthweight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Babies born under 2.5
kilograms have a 40-fold greater risk of dying in the neonatal
period and a 50 percent greater risk of serious developmental
problems in addition to other illness, the United Nations Children
's Fund (UNICEF) said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Executive Director of UNICEF, Carol Bellamy, stated that little
progress has been made on decreasing these risks over the past
decade and said new partnerships in the future are needed to help
remedy a problem that continues to impact millions of poor
children and their families.
</P>
<P>
This assessment followed a two-day technical consultation
sponsored by UNICEF, the World Bank and the United States'
Department of Agriculture. Over twenty million babies born alive
each year -- mostly in developing countries -- weigh less than 2.5
kilograms.
</P>
<P>
"This figure is unacceptable," Bellamy said. "In 1990, heads of
State and Government at the World Summit for Children identified
low birthweight as a priority over the next decade. The summit set
a goal of reducing low birthweght to 10 percent or less by the
year 2000 and we are far from reaching it."
</P>
<P>
"This consultation gives us the opportunity of really moving
forward," Bellamy said. "UNICEF sees raising the birthweight of
newborns as a key component of our strategy for early childhood
development."
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to engaging ourselves even more in
activities in this crucial area," she added.
</P>
<P>
A two-day gathering of researchers, programmers and U.N.
leaders in New York looked at constraints to progress on the issue
of low birthweight and at research and programming needs in the
short and longer term to address the problem.
</P>
<P>
The group agreed that one key area of focus would be to
improve the nutritional status of adolescent girls and of pregnant
women.
</P>
<P>
 Another key intervention would be to ensure that all births
are registered and that babies are weighted at birth, to help
society as a whole to be more aware of the scope and severity of
the problem.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan on Wednesday urged
the United Nations and the international community to persuade
India to resume dialogue over Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
The move came after Shamshad Ahmad, Pakistan's Ambassador to
the United Nations, met with the president of the Security Council

about the volatile situation in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Ambassador Ahmad said "Pakistan is seriously
concerned about the escalating tension."
</P>

"On our part, we have always sought tension-free and good
neighborly relations with India on the basis of a final settlement
of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute. We have always shown restraint
and will continue to do so. but we will defend ourselves against
any act of aggression," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I informed the president about our recent formal offer to
India for resumption of dialogue at any time, any place and at any
level without any precondition. This is rooted in our belief that
all disputes should be resolved through peaceful means," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As always in the past, India's response regrettably has again
been negative," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I told the president that Pakistan seeks a fair, just and
equitable settlement of the Kashmir dispute in accordance with the
wishes of the people Jammu and Kashmir," the Ambassador added.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 5 (Xinhua) -- South African President Thabo
Mbeki, also Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement, is expected to

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Mamoepa said there is a general view within the Group of 77
that the interests of the South has been somewhat neglected in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
"There is concern that the United Nations does not focuses
sufficiently on development issues, that the South has little say
in the governance of the global economy and that the benefits
flowing from globalization and multilateral trade agreements have
accrued disproportionately to the North," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Mamoepa said South Africa hopes that the summit will contribute
to advancing the debate on people-centered development, increasing
momentum for the democratization of the UN and the reform of the
global economic order.
</P>

Moreover, South Africa is also expected to repeat during the
meeting its call for an early resumption of trade negotiations
within the framework of the World Trade Organization.

<HEADLINE> UN/ECE Presents New Headlamps for Vehicles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe (UN/ECE) has presented a new front-lighting
system for vehicles on the occasion of the 44th session of its
Working Party on Lighting and Light-Signalling.
</P>
<P>
The new lighting technology, known as Adaptive Front-lighting
System (AFS), improves significantly visibility for drivers at
night while reducing glare to drivers going in the opposite
direction,including under bad weather conditions, UN/ECE said at a
presentation here Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Provided with senso-motric control, the new AFS headlamps are
able to adapt their light to different situations such as adverse
weather and wet roads, bending roads, country roads, motorways or
town streets, while permitting a correct visibility to overhead
road signs, according to UN/ECE.
</P>
<P>
The UN/ECE working party will assess the advantages of the AFS
technology and possibly adopt it as a new requirement for future
vehicles.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Northern Border Residents Clash With Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of residents in northern
Israel clashed with police on Wednesday in a demonstration against
what they say is a lack of security in advance of Israel's planned
withdrawal from the occupied buffer zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The residents of the Margaliot village, which is located just a
few meters from the border, burned tires and blocked a road in the
village during the protest. They clashed at one point with the
police and fire-fighters attempting to douse the burning tires.
</P>
<P>
"They are turning us into Israel's front line," the village
secretary Eitan David told the Israel Radio, adding that "we don't
want to be soldiers, but want to be citizens like everyone else and
allow our children to go and play like in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem,
without fear."
</P>
<P>
The residents of the areas have asked the government to improve
their security facilities in light of the planned Israel's troop
withdrawal from the so-called security zone, which Israel set up in
1985 with a self-proclaimed purpose of protecting its northern
border areas from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak decided to pullout the Israeli troops
from the zone by July this year with or without a peace agreement
with Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
On the security problem along the border, Deputy Defense
Minister Ephraim Sneh said Wednesday that it is impossible for the
government to provide each resident in the north with a security
room.
</P>
<P>
But it is possible to provide a security room for three or four
people or each family and the government has this plan in mind,
Sneh said.
</P>
<P>
In the event of rocket attacks launched by Lebanese guerrillas
in south lebanon, local residents in the north usually enter the
security rooms for self-protection.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM Praises Annan's Efforts on Lebanon Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy Wednesday thanked United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan
for his efforts to ensure a quiet and safe withdrawal of Israeli
troops from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Levy said Israel agrees with
Annan to his ongoing consultations with all sides concerned over
the withdrawal issue.
</P>
<P>
Levy was referring to Annan's dispatch of a special envoy to
Beirut earlier in the day. The envoy is to brief Lebanese leaders
on the meeting between Annan and Levy at the U.N. office in Geneva
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Annan told Levy that he plans to help Israel
carry out the withdrawal on the basis of U.N. Security Council
Resolution 425, according to a statement issued by Levy's office.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, which was passed in 1978 after Israel launched a
large-scale aggression against Lebanon in the name of wiping out
Palestinian guerrillas there, calls for an immediate and
unconditional Israeli pullout from all Lebanese territory and for a
return of full sovereignty to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel is planning to pull out its troops under the resolution
from the so-called security zone in south Lebanon to the
international border between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The 15-kilometer-deep buffer zone was set up by Israel in 1985
with a self-claimed aim of preventing cross-border guerrilla
attacks on its north. But mounting Israeli casualties in the zone
have spurred a growing public pressure for a pullout.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet on March 5 gave backing to a key pledge made
by Prime Minister Ehud Barak to withdraw from the zone by July,
with or without a peace deal with Syria, the major power broker in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian talks, which resumed last December after a
45-month break, broke off again in January over a dispute on the
fate of the Golan Heights, a strategic Syrian plateau seized by
Israel in the 1967 Middle East war. 
</P>
<P>
The latest effort to revive the talks, a summit meeting between
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and United States President Bill
Clinton in Geneva on March 26, failed to produce any progress as
expected.
</P>
<P>
Some strategy experts predicted that in such a case, Hezbollah,
the Shiite Muslim militia fighting to end Israeli occupation since
1980s, will escalate its activities against Israeli soldiers and
even launch attacks on Israel's northern settlements.
</P>
<P>
To prevent such ugly things to happen, Barak's administration
had resorted to the mandate of the United Nations and Resolution
425 to ensure international support and assistance for its pullout,
although Israel never openly accepted the resolution before.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Levy reportedly hope the endorsement of Annan and
international certification of Israel's efforts will prevent future
attacks by Hezbollah, or other militant groups which will occupy
the vacuum areas after Israel Defense Forces leaves there this
July.
</P>
<P>
Israeli leaders are of the view that the international support
will at least make Israel's future retaliation operations against
such attacks win more legitimacy and sympathy.
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks, Israel officials were also promoting the
idea of extending authority of the current U.N. Interim Force in
Lebanon (UNIFIL) to the whole security zone to ensure there will be
no vacuum left.
</P>
<P>
The 4,500-strong peacekeeping troops from nine countries are
currently deployed primarily in the western and central sectors of
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Annan promised Tuesday that if it is necessary to increase the
number of or strengthen the mandate of the UNIFIL, he will consider
proposing a new resolution beyond 425.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Court Blocks Controversial Release of Jewish Murderer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli High Court of Justice
Wednesday officially put off the controversial release of Yoram
Shkolnik, a Jewish life prisoner sentenced for murdering a
Palestinian, for at least several weeks.
</P>
<P>
The ruling was issued by a seven-member panel of the High Court
after they heard the appealing filed by liberal Knesset
(parliament) member Zahava Galn against the planned release of
Shkolnik, which is originally due to happen on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The judges decreed in the ruling that the release should be
delayed until the court issued its final ruling of the case, which
usually could take several weeks, Israel Wire reported.
</P>
<P>
The crime took place in March 1993, when a Palestinian man named
Abu Sabah was picked up hitchhiking by two Jewish settlers. The
settles later claimed he attacked them with a knife and they
subdued him and tied his hands and feet.
</P>
<P>
After hearing about the news from a two-way radio in his car,
Skolnik drove to the area, pulled out his Uzi submachine gun and
shot dead the Arab man, who was lying face down on the ground at
that time. 
</P>
<P>
Skolnik was later convicted of murder and sentenced to life
imprisonment for the killing. His sentence was commuted to 15 years
by President Ezer Weizman in 1997, and then reduced again to 11
years in 1999.
</P>
<P>
A Prison Parole Board decided last month to grant an early
release to him because of "his contrition and his good behavior in
prison." 
</P>
<P>
The controversial release immediately prompted objections from
the State Attorney's Office and the Arab parties, who satirized
that the life of an Arab is worth very little, especially if the
one who takes it is a Jew.
</P>
<P>
The Arab parties even submitted a no-confidence motion over the
release. Legislator Galon, from the left-wing Meretz party, also
called upon the High Court to stop the planned release, insisting
it is crazy for a convicted murderer to only serve seven years in
jail.
</P>
<P>
Galon's stand got support from Attorney General Elyakim
Rubinstein and State Attorney Edna Arbel, who argued that such a
decision should be annulled on the grounds of its extreme
irregularity.
</P>
<P>
Justice Aaron Barak, the president of the High Court of Justice,
appointed the seven-judge panel to hear the appeal.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Takes Steps to Ensure Security Along LoC: Musharraf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Chief Executive
General Pervez Musharraf Wednesday said that "adequate measures"
are being taken to ensure security along the Line of Control (LoC)
in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
He said this while presiding over a meeting of the federal
cabinet, according to an official press release issued here.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recent "media hype being generated by India"
about increasing tension in the region, Musharraf said that the
security environment in the region is being constantly reviewed
and monitored.
</P>
<P>
The LoC divides vigilant Pakistani and Indian troops in the
disputed area of Kashmir, where they fought two of their three
wars during the past 53 years and the Kargil conflict brought them
to the very brink of a third all-out Kashmir war last summer.
</P>
<P>
The tension in the LoC area has been high this year when
several military clashes occurred and, especially, after 35 Sikhs
were murdered in India-controlled Kashmir late March, in which
India accused Pakistan of involvement.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Tamil Party Appeals for Civilian Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 5 (Xinhua) -- A Sri Lankan Tamil political party
on Wednesday called on the international community to persuade the
government to let the refugees trapped in northern Jaffna
peninsula leave for safer areas as fighting is continuing between
government troops and Tamil Tiger rebels.
</P>
<P>
"More than 5,000 Tamil civilians, including children, remain
trapped in Palai and Kilali areas for the last several days in the
midst of the on-going military confrontation," the Tamil Eelam
Liberation Organization (TELO), a former Tamil militant group,
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The TELO's appeal was echoed by the separatist Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels who alleged that the Sri Lanka
army was holding thousands of civilians as human shields in the
northern battle zones.
</P>
<P>
"Tamil civilians are trapped in the militarily occupied zones
and have been prevented by the Sri Lankan army from moving to
areas of safety and security," the LTTE said in statement sent
from their office in London on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE said that the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC) and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR)
delegations in Jaffna were failing in their duty to protect
civilians.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, heavy fighting broke out again on Wednesday in
Jaffna's southern sector between the LTTE rebels and government
troops with both sides bombarding each other's positions with
heavy volumes of mortar and artillery fire since morning.
</P>
<P>
The clandestine Voice of Tigers (VoT) radio said that the
guerrillas were continuing Operation Unceasing Waves III by
pushing further into the Jaffna peninsula and that LTTE's Special
Border Force and the Border Force are playing a key role in the
offensive.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's Jaffna peninsula has seen bloody battles since last
week as LTTE rebels try to retake their former stronghold, which
they lost in 1996. Hundreds of rebels and soldiers have been
killed or wounded in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
International aid officials said on Wednesday they had no
access to civilians in the area, who they feared were facing
shortages of food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
They said there were still some 1,300 families stuck in the
Kilali and Palai.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983, have vowed to
take back Jaffna, which might help the LTTE negotiate from a
position of strength if and when peace talks with the government
began.
</P>
<P>
The government is discussing constitutional reform proposals
with the main opposition United National Party that aims to end
the conflict by devolving more powers to regional councils,
including one that would be administered by Tamils.

<HEADLINE> India's Revenue Collections Suffer Marginal Shortfall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On an aggregated basis, India's total direct and indirect tax
collections for the past financial year was 1.65136 trillion
rupees (38.4 billion U.S. dollars) against the targeted figure of
1.6613 trillion rupees (38.63 billion dollars), leaving a deficit
of 9.94 billion rupees (231.2 million dollars), the Press Trust of
India quoted Kumar as saying in the northeastern city of Calcutta.
</P>
<P>
The shortfall of revenue collections was due to a deficit in
income tax, a category of direct taxes. Targeted at 266.84 billion
rupees (6.21 billion dollars), the actual collection of income tax
was only 243.25 billion rupees (5.66 billion dollars), said Kumar.
</P>
<P>
Collections of other categories of taxes, such as customs,
central excise, corporate tax and interest taxes, were all
slightly higher than the estimated figures, he added.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, last year's revenue collections had
grown by nearly 20 percent compared with the figure of the 1998-99
financial year, which was merely 1.37967 trillion rupees (32.09
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Indian government has set the target for revenue
collections in the 2000-01 financial year, starting this month and
concluding at the end of next March, at 2.04 trillion rupees (47.
44 billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Produce Map on Coral Reefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Space and
Aviation Agency will finalize work to produce a map on the country
's coral reefs by the end of 2000 as part of a national reef
rehabilitation program.
</P>
<P>
"The map on coral reefs is the initial target of Coremap (Coral
Reef Rehabilitation and Management Program)," said Bidawi Hasyim,
a researcher at the National Atomic Power Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said production of the map is a condition that must be
fulfilled to obtain funds for Coremap's implementation from a
number of international financial organizations, including the
Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
The map would be used to draw up a program to rehabilitate and
prevent further damage to the country's coral reefs, Bidawi said.
</P>
<P>
No accurate information is currently available on the total
width of sea bottom covered by coral reefs in Indonesia but it is
believed to be somewhere between 7,500 and 120,000 square
kilometers, according to the researcher.
</P>
<P>
"These figures are mainly hypothetical and not based on
research in the field," he was quoted by the Antara News Agency
Wednesday as saying.

HANOI, April 5 (Xinhua) -- A ground breaking ceremony for the
construction of the Ho Chi Minh Highway was held in Bo Trach
district of Vietnam's central province of Quang Binh Wednesday,
according to a report of Vietnam News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The 347-km stretch of the highway in the province will account
for more than a quarter of the total length of the highway, the
second north-south highway in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Ho Chi Minh Highway will connect Hoa Lac village in the
northern province of Ha Tay to Ho Chi Minh City's Binh Phuoc
Crossroads via the historic Ho Chi Minh Trail which was originally
built in 1959.
</P>
<P>
A total investment capital of 5,300 billion Vietnamese dong (
378 million U.S. dollars) will be needed in the first phase to
upgrade 1,094 km of the existing road and build 220 km of new road
which runs through 10 provinces from Ha Tay in the north to the
central highlands province of Kon Tum.
</P>
<P>
The national highway is linked to deep-water ports along the
country's central region to form a communication network
connecting to neighboring countries and ease traffic jams in the
monsoon season.
</P>
<P>
It will play an active role in the planning and reasonable use
of a potential-rich area with some 28 million people.

<HEADLINE> Three African Organizations to Cooperate in Transport Systems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Three African organizations have
signed an agreement over the development of efficient, safe and
integrated transport systems in eastern and southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
These organizations are the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA), the Southern Africa Transport and
Communications Commission (SATCC) and the United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa Sub-Regional Development Center for Southern
Africa (ECA/SRDC-SA).
</P>
<P>
A press release obtained from COMESA Center in Lusaka on
Wednesday said the three organizations had agreed to jointly
promote private sector participation in transport infrastructure
development and services.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to work for improvement of road safety on
international routes, harmonization of definitions and selection
of performance indicators in selected transit corridors and
promotion of measures to prevent and control the spread of
HIV/AIDS in transit transport corridors.
</P>
<P>
Opportunity will be provided for the regional organizations to
present case studies on ongoing activities in eastern and southern
Africa, the release said.
</P>
<P>
It said that a proposal for the improvement of the road safety
in the region will be prepared and submitted to Africa Development
Bank for financing.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of HIV/AIDS along the transit transport corridors,
it was agreed that the intervention of the regional economic
groupings through their transport programs would greatly augment
national and global programs in the prevention and control of the
pandemic.
</P>
<P>
The organizations will therefore cooperate in building up
information and educational elements to go together with programs
such as road safety and transit traffic facilitation, the release
said.
</P>
<P>
The organizations will also cooperate in facilitating the
successful implementation of transit road user charges.
</P>
<P>
According to the release, COMESA and the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) will prepare a manual on
implementation of the harmonized user charges to be used by the
road transport operations/agents and the regulators who manage the
road networks.
</P>
<P>
It is COMESA's policy to consult and collaborate with the other
regional economic groupings in order to eliminate duplication in
the use of resources and enhance complementarities which exist
amply in the region, the release said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Tourism Suffers 50 Percent Business Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's tourism industry has
suffered a 50-percent decline in tourist arrivals due to the fuel
crisis and the prevailing political uncertainty, the Zimbabwe
Tourism Authority (ZTA) said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
ZTA Chief Executive Etherton Mpisaunga told the Zimbabwe News
Agency that the industry estimates that between 40 and 50 percent
of business has been lost since the fuel crisis began last
November, compounded by the pre-election political bickering and
violence.
</P>
<P>
"The picture being painted in the foreign print and electronic
media is one of a not stable situation," he said, adding that the
prevailing situation nullified ZTA's efforts to clean up the
country's image abroad.
</P>
<P>
Chief executive Herbert Nkala of Rainbow Tourism Group, the
country's main tourism company, told the core group of the
National Economic Consultative Forum recently that tourist
arrivals within the group were about 40 percent less than that of
last year.
</P>
<P>
He said there was a general lack of confidence in what is
happening in the country as the fuel crisis entered its sixth
month.
</P>
<P>
"These issues are fundamental and should be urgently resolved.
Tourist arrivals are now 30 to 40 percent less than those of last
year and we still cannot tell those inquiring when the fuel
problem will be solved," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is the third largest contributor to Zimbabwe's Gross
Domestic Growth after agriculture and manufacturing.

<P>
SHANGHAI, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese scientific expedition
ship Xuelong (Snow Dragon) docked at the port of Shanghai today,
marking the successful conclusion of its latest voyage to
Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
The Xuelong left the port of Pudong here on November 1 last
year, embarking on China's 16th expedition to the Antarctic
continent since the first expedition was mounted in 1984. The
Xuelong sailed 27,053 nautical miles over a period of 157 days to
reach its destination.
</P>
<P>
The 137 members of the expedition conducted scientific research
projects and supply tasks for China's Antarctic research stations
of Zhongshan and Changcheng.
</P>
<P>
They collected geographical data for relief maps of 64
Antarctic islands and 110 sq km of the continent.
</P>
<P>
One of the most important findings was a yellow earth-like
substance which proved to be ancient soil, found in an ice gorge.
</P>
<P>
The team also collected 28 samples of aerolite and an abundance
of ice and snow samples, which it is expected will provide a
deeper understanding of global climate changes.

<HEADLINE> Israel Releases a Long-held Lebanese Detainee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Israel freed Rassan Dirani, a 35-
year-old Lebanese citizen who was abducted 14 years ago, from
administrative detention on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tel Aviv District Court issued the order of release 10 days ago,
but the gag order preventing media from publishing the news was
only lifted Wednesday, according to Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Dirani, who was detained by pro-Israeli Lebanese Christian
militias and then transferred to an Israeli jail, will be handed
over to the International Red Cross and return to Lebanon
immediately after his release.
</P>
<P>
His lawyer revealed that his client is mental ill now because of
the long-time detention, arguing that Dirani's only so-called crime
was that he is a nephew of Mustafa Dirani, security chief of the
Lebanese resistance militia Amal.
</P>
<P>
Mustafa Dirani, who was also captured by Israeli agents in a
special operation in 1994, is still held in administrative
detention and no charges have been filed against him.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that 21 Lebanese had been held in Israeli
administrative detention and they are used by Israel as bargaining
chips for information or return of Ron Arad, a Israeli Air Force
navigator who has been missing since 14 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Five of them were freed in last December and two more were freed
in January this year.
</P>
<P>
Arad parachuted from his hit Phantom fighter on Lebanese soils
in October 1986 and then was reportedly captured by Mustafa Dirani,
who is believed to have "sold" Arad later to either Lebanese
Hezbollah guerrillas or Iranian elements.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in March, Mustafa Dirani alleged that he was tortured
and raped when he was under interrogation. He sued the state for 6
million shekels (about 1.5 million U.S. dollars) in compensation in
a lawsuit filed in Tel Aviv District Court.

<HEADLINE> Estrada to Ignore Charges of Protest Movements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said Wednesday he will no longer devote time answering the charges
hurled against him by what he called power-hungry protest groups.
</P>
<P>
The president said in a statement that the groups are make a
lot of noise now because of the upcoming elections in 2001.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that he is more committed than ever to making sure
that his presidency will help the poor cross over to a more decent
quality of life.
</P>
<P>
"I have a sworn duty to serve our people and not just the
elitists.I will continue working to solve our nation's problems,"
he said.
</P>

The president questioned the credibility of some of those
behind the protest movements. Some of them, he said, lost to him
in the last elections, and some of them are facing charges of
graft.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Presidential Palace asked Department of Social
Welfare and Development Secretary Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to
resign from her post due to her alleged links to moves to oust
President Estrada.

will be asked to explain her involvement in the oust Estrada
campaign by the opposition when she come back from her foreign
visit.

Zamora's challenge came after Senate Minority Floor Leader
Teofisto Guingona wrote Estrada an open letter on Monday, asking
him to resign from his post.

Guingona and Arroyo belong to the same political party, Laka-
NUCD.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President to Mediate in Zimbabwe-Britain Stand-Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo has been asked to mediate in the simmering stand-off
between Zimbabwe and Britain over land issue in a bid to restore
the previous confidence and goodwill.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries plummeted to an all-time
low because of issues mainly pertaining to Zimbabwe's land
policies, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The appointment was made following a meeting with British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook this week, said Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We met with Mr. Robin Cook at his own insistence. He had met
with Mr. Obasanjo and other presidents and asked Obasanjo to
assist on the relations between us and Britain," he told
Zimbabwean reporters during a stop-over in the Kenyan capital
Nairobi after attending the first Africa-Europe summit in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe met with Cook during the Africa-Europe summit which
ended on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Britain had earlier approached several presidents including
Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique
before settling on Obasanjo as the mediator.
</P>
<P>
The bad relations between the two countries were further
worsened last weekend when some white people were caught up in
violent clashes between a group of opposition National
Constitutional Assembly members who were marching for peace and
veterans of Zimbabwe's liberation war, whom the marchers accused
of illegally occupying white-owned farms.
</P>
<P>
The land dispute emanated from the fact that the Zimbabwean
government wants to acquire farms for resettlement and only pay
for improvements, while the Britons want compensation to be paid
for the land as well.
</P>
<P>
A bill which seeks to give the Zimbabwean government power to
compulsorily acquire land without paying compensation is going
through the parliament.
</P>
<P>
"I told Cook that we didn't accept the way Britain was treating
us," Mugabe said, adding that Zimbabwe's "relations with the Labor
government are worse than those with the Conservatives."
</P>
<P>
During the Lancaster House talks that culminated in Zimbabwe's
independence in 1980, the British government agreed to fund the
southern African country's resettlement program, Mugabe told Cook.
</P>
<P>
"We said we are at a stage where the people are demanding more
land, and we are supporting the war veterans (on farm invasions),"
he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Mugabe, Cook pledged his government's commitment
to fund the land reform program, but insisted that the program
should be carried out to improve the lot of rural farmers, and
that it should be done through the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said his government would not refuse the assistance as
long as the British government was prepared to go along with the
clause now being debated in Zimbabwe's parliament.
</P>
<P>
A three-man multi-sectoral team from the Zimbabwean government
would now go to London to discuss the proposals over the land
issue with British officials.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for Fast Reaction to Disasters in Horn of Africa  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 5 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Wednesday called for a fast reaction to disasters in the
Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini,
Annan announced that a team led by U.N. World Food Program (WFP)
chief Catherine Bertini will leave for the Horn of Africa next
week to assess the food needs of the famine-threatened region.
</P>
<P>
Bertini is scheduled to visit Ethiopia, Djibouti, Eritrea and
Kenya from April 11 to 19.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the first day of a long visit to Rome, Annan
admitted that the international community had responded a little
slowly.
</P>
<P>
But he insisted that "it's not too late to save lives," urging
"those countries which are able to give" to give generously to
save lives.
</P>
<P>
Dini said Italy was preparing a drought program "which will be
announced very shortly."
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Ethiopia accused rich nations of waiting to "see
skeletons on their TV screens" before acting.
</P>
<P>
Annan appointed Bertini last Thursday as his special envoy on
the drought in the Greater Horn of Africa, where the WFP estimates
that 12.4 million people in seven countries are facing food
insecurity or famine due to prolonged drought.

<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Time is running out for the
organizers of the China Rally race to find adequate money before
the International Automobile Federation (FIA) meets in Paris on
April 6, which will decide the fate of the race.
</P>
<P>
After a successful year of 1999 when China staged the first
ever World Championship Rally event in Huairou County in Beijing
suburbs, an official of the China Automobile Association (CAA)
said they had failed to find suitable sponsors before the deadline.
</P>
<P>
"We're waiting for the final decision from the FIA meeting,"
the CAA official said here on Wednesday. The official declined to
be named.
</P>
<P>
With the principal sponsors pulling out of the race last month,
the organizers have been looking for big-name companies worldwide
to fund the event.
</P>
<P>
The race was originally scheduled for September 7-10, but teams
need at least half a year to make their preparations.
</P>
<P>
But the official said the race would still be included in the
Asian-Pacific Rally circuit.

<HEADLINE> European Plane Leaves Baghdad After Completing Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 5 (Xinhua) -- A European airplane that landed in
Baghdad without getting prior U.N. permission departed on Wednesday
morning for Rome, Italy, after completing its mission in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The plane took off at 10:25 (0725 GMT) from the Al-Rashed
military airport in the southern suburbs of Baghdad, reported the
Iraqi News Agency (INA).
</P>
<P>
The plane, carrying three people from France and Italy, landed
at the Al-Rashed airport on Monday evening defying the decade-long
U.N. embargo on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It was the first group that arrived in Baghdad by plane
disregarding the U.N. resolutions that require all flights to or
from Iraq must get approval from the U.N. Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz met the three Europeans,
one from France and two from Italy, on Tuesday and appreciated
their "brave initiative" that defied the embargo.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the delegation, Vittorio Sgarbi, member of the
European Parliament, expressed solidarity and sympathy with the
Iraqi people who have been under crippling U.N. sanctions since
1990 when Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait, said the INA.
</P>
<P>
In a declaration upon its arrival, the group termed the U.S. and
British regular unilateral bombardments against Iraq as "a
violation of international law," "acts of terrorism" and "a
genocide."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iran to Respond to U.S. Overtures at Right Time: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said here on Wednesday that Iran will respond to U.S.
overtures on improving relations at the right time.
</P>
<P>
"We will give a detailed response and at the right time,"
Kharrazi said while commenting on recent remarks of U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference with visiting Danish
Foreign Minister Niles Helveg Petersen, Kharrazi said Iran would
not be hasty in this respect, as "haste is not good in politics and
diplomacy."
</P>
<P>
Albright last month announced the lifting of a ban on Iran's
three major non-oil exports - carpets, pistachios and caviar - and
called for a new chapter of relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The move came after Iranian reformists won a landslide victory
over their conservative opponents in parliamentary elections in
February, a development welcomed by Western countries.
</P>
<P>
Albright's admittance of U.S. interference in some internal
affairs of Iran in the past is an important and answerable
confession, Kharrazi said.
</P>
<P>
However, what is important is to see how the U.S. administration
will compensate for its admitted breaches of responsibility, he
stressed, adding that the Iranian government has already started
legal studies on this matter and will announce the result in time.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries were severed in 1980 after
Iranian students seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held 52
Americans hostage for 444 days in the heyday of the 1979 Islamic
revolution which overthrew the U.S.-backed Shah regime.
</P>
<P>
Since Iran's moderate President Mohammad Khatami came to power
in 1997, the two countries have softened their hostile tones toward
each other and Washington has repeatedly called for direct dialog
with Tehran.
</P>
<P>
But Iran insists that the U.S. take concrete actions to show
their sincerity in improving ties.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Seeks Death Sentence for Rogue Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said Wednesday that he wants the two rogue soldiers who shot dead
six innocent civilians in Mindoro Oriental province Monday night
to be meted the death penalty for their heinous crime.
</P>
<P>
On his weekly radio program, the president said the
perpetrators deserve no mercy because they have tarnished the good
image of the military.
</P>
<P>
"The justice system will make sure they get the death penalty.
Our military is starting to regain the trust of the people when
they committed the crime. This is a sad development," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the two drunken army soldiers, Marcial
Ambulo and Jovy Rubio, shot dead six civilians Monday night in a
killing spree in Victoria in the southern province.
</P>
<P>
They surrendered to their commanding officer after the killing,
but Ambulo escaped from custody before dawn Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Estrada went to the scene of the massacre Tuesday and condoled
with the families of the victims. The president has given police
and military authorities 48 hours to arrest Ambulo.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Alfredo Lim of the Department of Interior and Local
Government said the Philippine National Police and Armed Forces of
the Philippines are doing their best to meet the president's
deadline.
</P>
<P>
Lim added that the suspects face a court-martial for their
action,along with criminal charges of multiple murder.
</P>
<P>
"The criminal case will be pursued alongside the court-martial.
It is important that justice be done," Lim said.

<HEADLINE> Japan's New PM Re-appoints All Cabinet Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Newly elected Japanese Prime
Minister Yoshiro Mori Wednesday re-appointed all ministers from
the cabinet of his predecessor, Keizo Obuchi, in forming his own
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet lineup was announced ahead of its formal
inauguration later in the day. The ministers were formally
appointed after an attestation ceremony at the Imperial Palace in
the evening.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet became the third in Japanese history to re-appoint
all ministers from the preceding cabinet following Nobusuke
Kishi's cabinet in 1957 and Eisaku Sato's cabinet in 1964.
</P>
<P>
Chief Cabinet Secretary Mikio Aoki said Mori decided to appoint
the ministers to their old posts "because changing ministers would
hinder Diet (parliament) business, including the deliberations of
bills."
</P>
<P>
Mori, who was elected president of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) earlier in the day, was named by both
houses of the Diet as the new Japanese prime minister to succeed
Obuchi, who remains comatose after suffering a stroke Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mori, 62, leader of a major LDP faction, won solid majorities
in both houses of the Diet with the support of the LDP and its two
coalition partners, the New Komeito party and the newly launched
Conservative Party, which was founded by a splinter group from the
Liberal Party (LP).
</P>
<P>
One of the most pressing matters facing the Mori cabinet is the
passage of bills related to the national budget for fiscal 2000,
which is aimed at realizing economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
On the diplomatic front, Mori is expected to meet Russian
President-elect Vladimir Putin later this month and make
preparations for the July summit of the Group of Eight (G-8), to
be held in Japan's Okinawa Prefecture.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian Deputy Foreign Minister
Alexander Losyukov said Wednesday that Moscow hopes that Japan's
new Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori will continue the policy of
advancing close cooperation with Russia in all spheres.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Losyukov expressed his deep regret over the grave
condition of former Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, who was
taken to hospital after a massive stroke and is now in a coma.
</P>
<P>
"Keizo Obuchi contributed much to the advancement of Russian-
Japanese relations," Losyukov said. "We hope that the new premier
is determined on continuing close ties with Russia."
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency quoted Losyukov as saying that signals
from Tokyo indicate that the new prime minister is encouraging
diplomats to keep such close ties with Russia on track.
</P>
<P>
He also said the upcoming informal Russian-Japanese summit "
fits into the dialogue and cooperation between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
The new Japanese prime minister is scheduled to come to Russia
on April 28-30 for the informal summit, but the specific venue has
not been decided yet.
</P>
<P>
"We regard this as a manifestation of the willingness of the
Japanese leadership to move in the same direction as (it did)
under Obuchi -- toward the development of close cooperation with
Russia in all directions," Losyukov said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Yantai Economic and
Technological Development Zone, a major state-level development
zone in the city of Yantai in east China's Shandong Province, has
maintained an annual growth rate of 54 percent on average over the
past 15 years, with gross domestic product reaching 3.71 billion
yuan in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Local experts attributed the upward trend mainly to the
development of high-tech industries in the zone.
</P>
<P>
During the past few years, investors from more than 20 foreign
countries, including the United States, Japan, Germany and the
Republic of Korea, have opened 805 businesses in the zone, with a
total investment of 2.71 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
These businesses have helped the zone build information
technology, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and automotive parts and
components into pillar industries.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics show that these enterprises have
contributed 80 percent of the zone's total industrial output.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts predict that the zone will keep up its rapid
development momentum in the years to come as more high-tech
projects are introduced to the zone.

NANNING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Road links in southwest China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region will be substantially upgraded
with a subsidy of two billion yuan from the Central Government
over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
The region, densely populated by ethnic-minority people, has
lagged behind China's coastal areas. Mountainous conditions are
blamed for the region's tardy economic development.
</P>
<P>
The fund will be spent building roads running through remote
mountain areas in Hechi Prefecture, to benefit 3.73 million people.
</P>
<P>
Road construction has long been one of the most important
poverty-relief measures in China. The project in Guangxi will help
the region export its rich natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi is also expecting a package loan worth three billion
yuan (about 361 million US dollars) from the World Bank for a 236-

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Economic and
Technological Development Zone (BETDZ) will further perfect its
environment for overseas investors, as China's entry into the WTO
is close, Li Fengling, chief of the zone administration, told a
press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
As a state-level new and high technology development zone,
BETDZ enjoys preferential policies, which, however, will not be of
much help after China's entry into the WTO, said Li.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the only way to promote the zone's
competitiveness is to improve the investment environment by means
of more standard, user-oriented and transparent management
according to law.
</P>
<P>
So the zone has drawn up a plan to upgrade its infrastructure,
including a sewage facility with daily capacity of 20,000 tons, a
pipeline for running water, a school and 4,200 square meters of
factory buildings.
</P>
<P>
The zone also promises quality and fast services to investors.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that from 1994 to late February this year,
altogether 530 enterprises from over 30 countries and regions
entered the zone, bringing with them a total investment of 2.2
billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Body Donation Remains Taboo in Tradition-Bound China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The last wish of cancer-ridden Sun
Meiyan was to leave her diseased body to a dissecting room for the
purpose of medical study.
</P>
<P>
Amid profound grief, family members of the middle-aged worker
acted at her behest after she died two weeks ago. Her legacy soon
became front-page news in many Beijing newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The reason why it was news was because offering one's body
after death for autopsy research or organ transplants remains a
taboo among most Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that only 6,000 people have volunteered to be
body donors, among whom nearly 2,000 have had their wish fulfilled,
in Shanghai since the metropolis with some 14 million residents
initiated the endeavor in 1983.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 Beijing residents applied to be donors after three
local medical colleges opened special stations to accept such
donations last May. The cities of Wuhan, Nanjing and Yangzhou have
since followed suit.
</P>
<P>
Medical specialists admit that the current level of donations
can barely meet the enormous demand for organ transplants and
medical research.
</P>
<P>
At least two million Chinese lose their eyesight every year due
to cornea problems, 70 percent of whom, however, can be cured
through cornea transplant surgery.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, only 3,000 people are lucky enough to receive
the operation each year thanks to donations, according to a report
in the People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
Annually, less than 2,000 of 500,000 uremia sufferers
throughout the country receive kidney transplants, a key measure
to prolong the patient's life, leaving the majority struggling on
through time-wasting and expensive haemodialysis.
</P>
<P>
Medical academies also have a problem in carrying out post-
mortem practice due to a serious shortage of human cadavers.
</P>
<P>
Cao Chenggang, a professor at the prestigious Peking Union
Medical College (PUMC), acknowledges that many medical students
across the country have no access to cadavers, even though at the
PUMC every four students can work on one.

<HEADLINE> Body Donation Remains Taboo in Tradition-bound China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although 20 years after the modernization drive started the
Chinese people have become more open-minded, most of them still
shun the topic of body donation as a result of bred-in-the-bone
thinking that one's body is given by one's parents and can never
be destroyed before it is buried in the earth.
</P>
<P>
The adherence to tradition makes the situation of blood and
bone marrow donation formidable, too.
</P>
<P>
Some people who brave traditional opinion often encounter
prejudice or even strong opposition from family members,
colleagues and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"It's really hard to make contributions to society after death,
" Liu Yuqing, a retiree from Wuhan University, said as he recalled
his own experience.
</P>
<P>
Another obstacle is the lack of laws to regulate the matter.
Lots of volunteers have been turned down by medical colleges for
fear of possible disputes if the donor's family declines to follow
his or her wish.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers in Shanghai and Guangzhou are thinking about drafting
local regulations on body donation before a national law is drawn
up.
</P>
<P>
"We can learn from some foreign countries that allow the
volunteer donor to carry a donation card so that the body can be
used if the person is killed in an accident," said Professor Cao
of the PUMC.

<HEADLINE> Local Regulations Issued to Prevent Domestic Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- China's Liaoning and Hunan
provinces have issued local regulations to prevent domestic
violence, and Shaanxi Province is to issue similar regulations,
according to the All-China Women's Federation (ACWF).
</P>
<P>
Northeast China's Liaoning Province issued regulations on the
prevention of domestic violence on March 8, and later the Standing
Committee of the Hunan Provincial People's Congress also approved
a decision for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of such local regulations has enriched the
laws and regulations concerning the protection of women's rights
in China, said an official of the ACWF, who added that the
regulations will also draw more social attention to domestic
violence.
</P>
<P>
The issuing of the regulations is a result of economic and
social progress in China, said Li Hui, a judge of the Supreme
Court of China. She said it is also a general trend that domestic
violence will finally be outlawed by state regulations.
</P>
<P>
There are no national regulations concerning domestic violence
in China yet, but some local governments have used other methods
such as establishing special courts to protect women's rights,
said Li.
</P>
<P>
Domestic violence is becoming rampant in some parts of the
country, especially in rural areas, nowadays, according to surveys
by the ACWF. In the past five years, about one fourth of the
complaints concerning marriage and the family which were dealt
with by the women's federation in Hunan involved domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
The regulations issued by the two provinces will unite judicial
departments and public security departments in dealing with
domestic violence by using stricter and more careful methods.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Reformists Push for Cabinet Reshuffle: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran's reformists are pressing
President Mohammad Khatami to reshuffle the cabinet by removing
ministers who are not fully cooperating with them, the conservative
daily Tehran Times said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Following the overwhelming victory in the parliamentary election
on February 18, the reformist Islamic Iran Participation Front
(IIPF) has put cabinet reshuffle on its agenda, an informed source
told the daily.
</P>
<P>
The source said that the proposed reshuffle would include Vice
President for Executive Affairs Mohammad Hashemi, Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi, Education Minister Hossein Mozaffar and
Construction Jihad Minister Mohammad Saeedi-Kiya.
</P>
<P>
The current cabinet, formed in August 1997, is a coalition of
the IIPP, the centrist Party of Constructive Executives of Iran
(PCEI) and the leftist Assembly of Combatant Clergy in Tehran
(ACC), which helped Khatami win the presidential election in 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, relations between reformists and centrists soured
before the February parliamentary election as the former strongly
opposed the candidacy of former President Hashemi Rafsanjani while
latter supported him.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Times quoted unidentified source as saying that the
reformists wanted to replace Mohammad Hashemi, Rafsanjani's
brother, with Mohammad Ali Najafi, current vice president and head
of the Plan and Budget Organization.
</P>
<P>
Both Hashemi and Najafi are members of the PCEI, which was
headed by disgraced former Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi.
</P>
<P>
Hashemi strongly blasted the reformists for their opposition to
Rafsanjani's candidacy before the parliamentary election. His harsh
words won conservatives' support for Rafsanjani, but caused more
people to drop their support for Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, the current chairman of the powerful advisory State
Expediency Council, barely won a seat in the parliament in Tehran
constituency.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Times named Deputy Foreign Minister for Arab and African
Affairs Mohammad Sadr and Iran's ambassador to France as the
reformists' favorites to enter the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
However, so far the IIPF, headed by Mohammad Reza Khatami, the
president's younger brother, has not officially announced any
reshuffle plan.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Meets Israeli Ministers on Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met
Tuesday night with two visiting Israeli ministers on the latest
developments of the Middle East peace process, particularly on the
Palestinian track, the Palestinian news agency WAFA reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Arafat discussed with Israeli Minister of
Justice Yossi Beilin and Minister of Immigration and Absorption
Yuli Tamir in the West Bank town of Ramallah interim issues,
including the release of more Palestinian prisoners, said Arafat's
advisor Nabil Abu-Rudeina after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has recently demanded Israel release 250
security prisoners while claiming that there are some 1,500
Palestinians still held in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
Beilin said he did not carry any message from Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak to Arafat and expressed his hope that a peace
agreement could be reached before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli minister, regarded as the architect of the 1993 Oslo
Peace Accord, stressed the need for the two sides to make peace and
put an end to the decades-old conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat, who also attended the
meeting, affirmed that the talks were extensive and profound and
focused on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
All efforts should be exerted to reach a comprehensive peace
treaty on solving all final status issues, he added.
</P>
<P>
Led by Yasser Abed Rabbo, Palestinian chief negotiator in the
final-status talks, the Palestinian delegation will leave Wednesday
for Washington to attend Thursday's second session of the
Palestinian-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
The new round of talks will focus on the Israeli troop pullout
from the West Bank in the last stage and the final status issues,
including the fate of Jerusalem, border demarcation, the return of
Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlements and water sharing.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have set a May deadline to draft a framework
agreement on solving those thorny issues before reaching a
permanent peace deal by September.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Vietnam to Promote Tourism Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and Vietnam have agreed
to promote travel and tourism cooperation between themselves and
within the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), the Tourism Authority
of Thailand said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached in a meeting between Thai Minister of
the Prime Minister's Office Praveena Hongsakul and Vietnamese Vice
President Tran Thi Thanh Thanh during the latter's recent official
visit to Thailand, the authority said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to promote bilateral tourism cooperation
and develop essential infrastructure, which is important to the
travel and tourism industry in the region, such as transportation
links, communication and human resources.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will exchange official visits to share
expertise, promote investment and undertake joint marketing and
promotion strategies. Attention will be focused on the development
of air and land links between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"To establish Thailand as the natural gateway to the GMS
countries and facilitate access, more flights between the two
countries should be established," Praveena was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
There are currently 14 direct flights between Bangkok and Hanoi
every week, 17 between Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh City and three
between Bangkok and Vietnam's southern port city of Da Nang.
</P>
<P>
Praveena also hoped to promote land routes to Vietnam via Laos.
</P>
<P>
"The many new roads and bridges being built will link the three
countries in the true spirit of GMS cooperation and we foresee a
very bright future for the tourism industry in the region," she
said.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Vietnamese visitor arrivals in Thailand totaled 44,947,
down 12.46 percent from 1998, while 16,373 Thais visited Vietnam,
up 4.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Somalis Demonstrate to Back Djibouti Peace Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 5 (Xinhua) -- More than 3,000 people
Wednesday marched into the street of the capital city and gathered
in the municipal Stadium of Mogadishu to demonstrate their
determined support for the forthcoming Djibouti conference on the
peace in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators from more than 26 former orphanage camps,
representing some 70,000 people in the war-torn country, have
carried placards with mottoes "force and Bullets are Not the
Solution", Unity is Strength, Separation is Disaster," "victory
for the Djibouti Conference" and others.
</P>
<P>
The streets in the capital were filled with noises of sirens,
music of Somali national anthem and thousands of jubilating
people.
</P>
<P>
All of the slogans and the speeches made in the Municipal
stadium have showed the public how Somalia's orphans are now
determined to support the forthcoming Djibouti conference.
</P>
<P>
Those orphaned people from decades long civil war are now
elderly people many of whom are famous like General Mohamed Nur
Galal, Abdi-Qasim Salad Hassan, Somalia last interior minister and
many others.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of orphans, Muse Abdulleh Mohamud who was among
the people who addressed the demonstrating people said they are
ready to defend with the last drop of their blood for the
obtaining a government for Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said, "the government has been the only parent we
had. Therefore, we should fight in reviving our parents."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there's another demonstration, which was far
smaller in number than the Orphans, was organized by the women
groups supporting faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid inside a
basketball hall of Mogadishu stadium.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 people including women and children have chanted words
against the Djibouti peace conference while Hussein Aidid himself
was listening to their poems and songs.
</P>
<P>
The two opposing demonstrations in Mogadishu in the same day
have been considered as a new and positive step forward since the
people have now got their liberty of expressing their feeling over
the politics affecting the future of their children.
</P>
<P>
Similar large demonstrations have been held in Bulo Burteh,
Beletuein and Jalalaqsi districts of Hiran region since the
beginning of the week in support of the forthcoming reconciliation
conference in Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
Also, the people in Middle and Lower Shabelleh regions have
supported Djibouti President Ghelle's peace initiative for
Somalia.

<HEADLINE> Decision to Harmonize Sharia Welcomed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The decision made by governors in
northern Nigeria to harmonize the controversial Islamic Sharia
code with extant laws was widely praised in the west African
country.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, Wednesday quoted
governor of the Southeast Abia State and Vice Chairman of the
ruling People's Democratic Party Orji Kalu as saying that the move
will get the country back on the road to achieve cohesion.
</P>
<P>
He challenged the northern governors to live up to their
promise, saying that they must put the interest of the country
first in whatever they do.
</P>
<P>
Governors of Nigeria's 19 northern states Monday resolved to
constitute a panel consisting of Muslims and Christians to
harmonize provisions of the Islamic Sharia law with the extant
penal code.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of Sharia was no pure religious decision, Kalu
said, blaming some hidden figures for trying to manipulating the
matter to find excuse for the come-back of military dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
George Igbokwe, Publicity Secretary of the Nigerian Bar
Association, hailed the decision historic on Tuesday. The northern
governors' decision vindicated President Olusegun Obasanjo's stand
that the issue be resolved through persuasion and not court
action, he said.
</P>
<P>
But he also pointed out the fact that some of the governors
didn't materialize the similar pledges made at a meeting of the
Council of State after February's nationwide clashes over Sharia,
killing some 1,000 people.

<HEADLINE> S. African Bank Announces Merger With African Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Standard Bank, a major bank
in South Africa, Wednesday announced a merger with African Bank to
improve service and enhance competition.
</P>
<P>
Standard Bank Chief Executive Officer Jack Marree told a press
conference here that the merger would better meet the need of the
mass market and provide associated insurance services.
</P>
<P>
The partnership would allow Standard Bank to expand its
financial services to the mass market more rapidly and generate
growth in the bank's accounts, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It will allow Standard Bank to optimize its existing
infrastructure more effectively and to extend its mass market
franchise whilst containing risk," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Marree, the partnership would generate an
estimated three billion rand (about 460 million U.S. dollars) in
loans within the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement of merger, Standard Bank would originate
African Bank loans through its AutoBank E and branch network,
while African Bank would originate Standard Bank E Plan accounts
through African Bank outlets.
</P>
<P>
African Bank, meanwhile, will benefit from the rapid expansion
over its private sector lending activities and an anticipated
strong growth in transactions accounts, said African Bank chief
executive officer Leon Kirkins.
</P>
<P>
The partnership would provide another strong channel for
African Bank products as Standard Bank has a well developed
private sector coverage, he said.
</P>
<P>
The mass market credit industry is South Africa's main provider
of loans to the emerging market with outstanding loans to the
value of 12 billion rand (1.84 billion U.S. dollars) per year.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The English Football League are to
launch moves which could block Leeds' proposal to link up with
Nationwide Division Two side Oldham Athletic.
</P>
<P>
The Elland Road club had proposed a 50-50 initiative with
Latics, to help fund their center of excellence for an initial
five-year period.
</P>
<P>
As part of the agreement Leeds Sporting plc, who own Leeds
United, have formed a subsidiary known as Leeds Sporting Youth
Development Limited and aim to acquire a 9.9 per cent stake in
Athletic for a nominal sum.
</P>
<P>
But League spokesman John Nagle said: "The regulations
specifically state clubs cannot hold or deal in shares of other
clubs without prior written consent of the Football League.
</P>
<P>
"We have not given our consent and if necessary have the power
to prevent this from happening. All clubs must abide by our rules
and regulations. This whole issue will need to be examined and we
will be contacting Leeds and Oldham," local paper The Express
quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Furious Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale hit back by saying: "If
this was stopped from going through the only people who would lose
out would be Oldham.
</P>
<P>
"We could set up a center of excellence right on their doorstep.
Is that what the Football League really wants?" he asked.

ZHENGZHOU, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Wheat output will probably
decline by a wide margin this year in Henan Province, a major
grain producer in central China, if the current drought continues.

<HEADLINE> Workers Allowed to Sell Shares of Collective Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- China now allows individual
workers to buy and sell shares of collective enterprises as the
State Administration of Taxation (SAT) asked individual workers
owning such shares to pay income tax today.
</P>
<P>
Sources from SAT said that this is the first time in history
that SAT has put forward such a requirement.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, China has begun to transform
a large number of collective enterprises around the country into
share-holding companies. In this process, it allows individual
workers to own shares of the companies, turning part of the
companies' assets into private ownership.
</P>
<P>
In a notice that it released today, SAT required individual
workers to pay income tax on dividends and proceeds from selling
such shares.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, China has nearly 1.8 million
collective industrial enterprises, which are scaled-down forms of
state-owned enterprises. Many of the collective enterprises are
township enterprises in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
China began to experiment with turning these enterprises into
share-holding companies in 1980. But it only begun to spread the
change to larger parts of the country at the beginning of this
year.
</P>
<P>
SAT did not provide any exact figure of the total amount of
additional income tax revenue that it hopes to collect after the
ownership of collective enterprises are switched.
</P>
<P>
China collected 41.4 billion yuan (about five billion US
dollars) in income tax from individuals last year, up 22 percent
over the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Senior Official on Quality-Oriented Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Personal qualities should include
ethics, culture, working ability, and a sound mind and body, and
one goal of higher education should be to combine these virtues,
according to Zhou Yuanqing, vice-minister of Education.
</P>
<P>
In an article written by Zhou and published in today's
Guangming Daily, he points out that quality-oriented education is
education which improves these qualities.
</P>
<P>
China's higher education has passed through a long period from
stressing knowledge to emphasizing comprehensive quality. "Reality
has proved such truth: those who are equipped with knowledge and
strong ability cannot be called people with high quality," notes
Zhou.
</P>
<P>
The most important part of quality-oriented education is the
harmonious development of knowledge, ability, and good qualities,
which is in accordance with the goal of China's higher education:
a well-knit foundation, profound knowledge, and strong ability.
</P>
<P>
Chinese universities have been stressing quality in cultural
education since 1995 in a bid to improve university students'
cultural qualities, notes Zhou.
</P>
<P>
He also points out that stressing this aspect of education has
been beneficial to implementing the goal of quality-oriented
education among Chinese universities.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Found Aerolites, Ancient Soil at South Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists found 28 pieces
of aerolites, ancient soil, and a number of samples of snow and
ice cores during China's 16th scientific expedition to the South
Pole.
</P>
<P>
The 157-day expedition ended Tuesday when the icebreaker Snow
Dragon carrying the Chinese scientists arrived at Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Ten scientists climbed up the nearly 3,000-meter-high Grove
Mountain at the South Pole, and drew world's first map of the
mountain on a scale of 1:25,000 with advanced methods including
Global Positioning System.
</P>
<P>
They found 28 pieces of precious aerolites at the mountain
region, which will help push forward the development of
cosmological chemistry and astrophysics.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say the aerolites contain much information about the
history of the solar system, and the aerolites found at the South
Pole, compared with those found elsewhere, are of greater value
because they are so well-preserved.
</P>
<P>
Prior to this expedition, scientists from Japan, the United
States, and Germany had found three aerolite-rich sites in the
Antarctic. This time, Chinese scientists discovered a fourth place
abundant in aerolites.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists also found ancient soil at the Antarctic for
the first time. "This finding confirms that the temperature at the
South Pole were much higher in prehistoric times than they are
today," said Liu Xiaohan, a researcher from the Geological
Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The soil samples will be sent to laboratories for further study
of the environmental changes at the South Pole over the ages.

attention of the Chinese government, according to the circular.
</P>
<P>
CCYL organizations at different levels are urged to study
instructions by the central leadership and help improve safety in
these young people's places and take measures to eliminate hidden
dangers, it says.
</P>
<P>
Thorough checks of safety facilities, mainly fire-fighting
equipment, should be carried out at these recreational sites, it
says, adding that young people should be further educated to
protect themselves as well as possible in the event of fire.

<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Participants at a conference on
China's Digital Library Project, which was held here today,
announced that the project has been officially launched after
years of preparations.
</P>
<P>
Government officials and experts from 21 units involved in the
project attended the meeting, at which some prominent experts and
scholars were appointed members of an advisory committee to guide
the project.
</P>
<P>
Digital libraries are electronic data bases for storing and
utilizing knowledge and information, emerging along with the
development of Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
Currently, English-language information dominates the Internet,
while Chinese-language information makes up less than one percent
of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
The creation of the China Digital Library is aimed at
increasing the use of Chinese-language information and promoting
the Chinese culture, the experts noted.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, local experts have conducted a series of
research projects related to the digital library, as the country
is now capable of building this important new storehouse of
culture and information.

<HEADLINE> China Law Society Marks Anniversary of Dong Biwu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The China Law Society held a forum
here today to mark the 25th anniversary of the death of Dong Biwu
(1886-1975), one of the founders of the Communist Party of China (
CPC) and an important trailblazer in the field of law for the
People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Attending the forum were Ren Jianxin, a vice chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) and chairman of the law society, and Luo Haocai,
a CPPCC National Committee vice chairman and a vice president of
the Supreme People's Court.
</P>
<P>
As a young man, Dong studied law in Japan and became a leading
official in charge of legal affairs in CPC-led revolutionary bases.
After 1949, when the People's Republic of China was founded, Dong
held a number of important positions including vice premier-cum-
chairman of the Politics and Law Committee, president of the
Supreme People's Court, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of
the National People's Congress, and acting state president.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Turns Down Arafat's Request for Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese officials said the time is
not appropriate for Palestinian President Yasser Arafat to visit
Beirut, the Daily Star newspaper reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has requested to visit Lebanon for talks on the Middle
East peace process, but a welcome is unlikely without signs that
Arafat is reconciling with Syria, Lebanon's main power broker, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
"Arafat's visit is totally out of the question now. We do not
reject the principle of a visit while suitable circumstances should
be created for such a visit", the paper quoted an official as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Telecommunication Minister Imad Falouji reportedly
delivered the request to President Emile Lahoud when he was
attending a conference in Beirut. But Falouji denied the saying.
</P>
<P>
Before 1982, Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)
made Lebanon its base from which they launched attack against
Israel. The PLO was also involved in Lebanese civil war which
erupted in 1975.
</P>
<P>
In 1978 and 1982 Israel staged large-scale invasions into
Lebanon in a bid to drive PLO out of the Arab country. Arafat and
his colleagues were forced to move to Tunisia in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Syria and the PLO turned sour after the
Palestinians signed with Israel Oslo accords that started the peace
process in 1993. Damascus insisted on a coordinated Arab stance
toward the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
So far, there are about 370,000 Palestinian refugees living in
Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Iran Discovers World Largest Sweet Gas Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar
Zanganeh announced on Wednesday that the largest sweet gas field in
the world has been discovered in southern Iran.
</P>
<P>
Zanganeh said that the independent onshore gas field has an
estimated reserve of more than 445 billion cubic meters of gas and
over 240 million barrels of liquid gas, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Tabnak gas field with an value of about 16.5
billion U.S. dollars was discovered in the southern Fars province
by the National Iranian Oil Exploration Company (NIOEC).
</P>
<P>
The exploration work started in 1998 and so far the drilling has
reached 2,245 meters deep with a cost of 30 billion rials (about 10
million dollars at the official rate), he said.
</P>
<P>
With a proven gas reserve of 21 trillion cubic meters, Iran
ranks second in the world after Russia. It also has a share in the
world's large gas field in the Gulf which has an estimated reserve
of over 12 trillion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Iran has drafted a 30-year exploitation
plan for the field and the production would start in the second
half of the current Iranian calendar year starting March 20.
</P>
<P>
He said that the daily production would be 1.5 billion to 2
million cubic feet or 40.5 million to 54 million cubic meters of
natural gas and 24,000 to 32,000 barrels of liquid gas.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the gas field will help push forward the
economic development of the Fars province on the northern coast of
the Persian Gulf, Zanganeh said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Iran has made desperate efforts to attract
foreign investment on the "buy-back" scheme to develop gas fields
and planned to replace oil with natural gas.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Multimedia
Development Corporation (MDC) Wednesday predicted that about 1.4
million Internet subscribers in the country are expected to
register by the end of this year against 778,000 at the end of
1999.
</P>
<P>
MDC Executive Chairman Othman Yeop Abdullah said in Petaling
Jaya near here that like last year, about 25 percent of the
subscribers are expected to come from the corporate sector.
</P>
<P>
In tandem with the anticipated rise in the number of Internet
subscribers, the number of Internet users in Malaysia is expected
to increase to between 6 million and 7 million by the end of this
year, he said, adding, "For each subscriber, there are normally
four or five users (getting access to the Internet), so you can
time 1.4 million subscribers by four or five."
</P>
<P>
He said the number of Malaysian Internet users who buy online
is also rapidly increasing, with total revenue from e-commerce
activities in Malaysia estimated at 187 million ringgit (49.21
million U.S. dollars) last year from 68 million ringgit (17.894

NEW DELHI, April 5 (Xinhua) -- More than 700 Indian and foreign
experts will attend a two-day conference on maps and geographic
information technologies here on April 10 and 11, the Indian
Center for Spatial Database Management and Solution (CSDMS)
announced here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The "Map India-2000" conference, jointly organized by India's
Ministry of Information Technology, Indian Space Research
Organization and the CSDMS, will discuss issues related to the
usefulness of maps and their availability in India.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is expected to come up with recommendations for
creating a liberalized national spatial data policy which is
needed to allow industry to carry out infrastructural and
developmental projects, CSDMS President M. P. Narayan told the

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Rainfall Declines Due to "La Nina": Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's rainfall in the
current small rainy season is expected to decline in intensity as
compared with the "good" season, the Reporter newspaper quoted a
weather expert as reporting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The main factor causing the decline of rainfall in Ethiopia is
the "La Nina" phenomena that occurred in eastern and central
Pacific Ocean, the expert at the Ethiopian Meteorology Institute
said.
</P>
<P>
The dry whether over the Indian Ocean is diverting the moist
air and clouds coming to Ethiopia as result of which the Tropical
Convergence Zone could not approach the north, he said.
</P>
<P>
This has created unusual rainfall in Mozambique, while have
sucked the moist air which was supposed to approach Ethiopia, the
expert said, adding this problem might continue for some time.
</P>
<P>
The lower intensity of rainfall in the current small rainy
season could lead to poor agricultural productivity in the coming
year, according the expert.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Rebels Kill 19 in Road Ambush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- At least 19 civilians have been
killed and another 15 wounded during a road ambush against
civilian vehicles launched by the Angolan rebel soldiers in the
northeast Lunda-norte province, official news agency Angop said
here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This tragedy, one of a chain of similar events, shows that the
Angolan rebels are making effort to infiltrate into the
diamond-abundant areas for getting logistic support for their
guerrilla troops, said local analysts.
</P>
<P>
The attack took place in the Nheco area, some 47 kilometers
from the city Dundo, located in extreme northeast Angola, when the
passengers of a 12-vehicle civilian convoy were on their way to
Lucapa, capital city of the Lunda-norte province.
</P>
<P>
According to a source from the National Police, eight of the 12
vehicles were destroyed in the attack.
</P>
<P>
Lunda-norte is famous for its abundant diamond reserves, which
has long- term supported the Angolan rebels led by Jonas Savimbi
for staging the civil war against the government troops.
</P>
<P>
After the Restauro Operation launched by the government troops
at the turn of the year, the rebels have been driven out of major
cities. But they scattered into small groups and resorted to
guerrilla warfare.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that the rebels, whose logistic support had
been cut off, need the precious stone for continuing the guerrilla
war.
</P>
<P>
In late March, 15 people died on the Xamacola/Muxinda road in
Capenda Camulemba municipality, as their vehicle hit a landmine.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Governors of Nigeria's Southeast
region Tuesday renewed their calls for confederation, according to
This Day, a leading Nigerian newspaper Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Achike Udenwa, chair of the governors' forum
in the region and governor of Imo State as saying that they would
pursue the matter from the constitutional point of view.
</P>
<P>
He said that the only way to douse the present tension in the
country is to adopt a confederation system, adding that
federation is by no means the break-up of the country.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the statement by President Olusegun Obasanjo last
month and some there prominent Nigerians that the call was
unpatriotic, Udenwa said that they were "not well advised" on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
He said the call truly reflected the "mood of grassroots
easterners", and would prevent the country from disintegrating if
implemented.
</P>
<P>
President Obasanjo last month dismissed the agitation for
federation or a national sovereignty conference as "highly
unpatriotic", and called on politicians to contribute to the
strengthening of a strong and united country.

LONDON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer club
West Ham's Rio Ferdinand has hinted he could quit Upton Park next
season unless the club starts challenging for a trophy.
</P>
<P>
The England defender admitted he was disappointed at the
Hammers form this season and warned that if the club sells any of
their top players it will hasten his departure.
</P>
<P>
"If the club wants to go forward, selling players can't happen,
" he said. "It's as simple as that. If it does, I'm off."
</P>
<P>
"I thought we had a really good chance of winning something
this season. Next year we've got to do it. We've been promising to
for three or four years, but we've under-achieved. It's no good
bringing through all these young players if we don't win something.
I've made no secret of the fact that I would like to play abroad
one day, to experience life in another country," he told New
Nation magazine.

<HEADLINE> Coulthard: I'll Be Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Formula one driver David Coulthard
has refused to write off his championship chances, despite being
kicked out of the Brazilian Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Scot fell 20 points behind Ferrari's Michael
Schumacher, after McLaren lost their appeal, on Tuesday, against
Coulthard's disqualification from second place in Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
But with 15 races still to come, Coulthard believes his title
dream is still alive and plans on launching his fightback in the
heart of Ferrari territory in Sunday's San Marino Grand Prix at
Imola.
</P>
<P>
"They have not won the championship yet and we are not going to
give it to them," Coulthard said.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to fight hard all the way. We can turn things
around and that is what we are going to do. We have a quick racing
car, we are going to a circuit which I like and where I have gone
well in the past and we want to take the challenge to Ferrari and
show them we still believe we have the best car," he said.
</P>
<P>
Coulthard, who along with team-mate Mika Hakkinen who is still
searching for his first point, won at Imola in 1998 and badly
needs to repeat the feat this weekend with Schumacher having won
both of the opening races.
</P>
<P>
The International Court of Appeal in Paris rejected McLaren's
claim that the bumpy nature of the Interlagos track caused the
front wing of Coulthard's car to become illegal.
</P>
<P>
The five-man panel said the Woking-based team should have taken
account of the difficult surface as their rivals had done.
</P>
<P>
"I went to Paris with what I felt was a very strong case,"
Coulthard said.
</P>
<P>
"But we will not allow this to have any affect on team morale.
</P>
<P>
"I have been around in Formula One for a few years and McLaren
have obviously been around much longer and there is always ups and
downs when you are competing. We have that every two weeks and we
are well used to being able to deal with things, put them behind
us and handle the facts," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua)-- A reception given by the Polish
embassy here today marked the 600th anniversary of the renovation
of the nation's academic jewel, Jagiellonian University.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Jizhong, professor of Eastern European languages at
Beijing Foreign Studies University and author of a book on the
university, said in a speech that Jagiellonian University has a
great and honorable tradition of democratic academic thought and
consistent reform.
</P>
<P>
The university, founded by King Kazimierz the Great in 1364,
was the second university ever founded in the Slavic ethnic region,
and was also among the first universities in Europe.
</P>
<P>
After suffering a decline following King Kazimierz's death, it
was renovated in 1400 with the support of King Jagiello and Queen
Jadwiga. It assumed the name of the king in 1818.
</P>
<P>
The university came to be one of the cultural and academic
centers of Europe in the mid-16th century, and the great
Renaissance scientist Nicolaus Copernicus was among its
distinguished students.

<HEADLINE> Trades on Patented Technologies Thrive in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The State Intellectual Property
Office (SIPO) today announced that trades on patented technologies
during the five-day China patent exhibition were valued at roughly
1.2 billion yuan (144.5 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based Xinchuang Company, a branch under Capital
Iron and Steel Company, and the Daxing Real Estate Development
Group signed a deal worth 380 million yuan for transferring
patented high-tech construction technology.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the SIPO said that it was the biggest deal
between two domestic partners in the country.
</P>
<P>
The newly-initiated construction technology, owned by both
Xinchuang Company and an inventor from the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region Li Lingqun, does not cost much to run, emits
little pollution and is energy saving.
</P>
<P>
Architects said that buildings constructed by the technology
might be able to withstand strong earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
The SIPO officials said that the successful transfer of the
technology reflects the thriving of trades on patented
technologies in China.
</P>
<P>
During the nation's largest patent Expo which ends today, many
big enterprises sent personnel to collect useful and profitable
information on patented technologies.
</P>
<P>
According to the organizers, the Expo attracted more than 60,
000 visitors and businessmen. Nearly 1,000 contracts were signed
during the Expo.
</P>
<P>
Intellectual property researchers said that more and more
Chinese enterprises try to own patents on advanced technologies
for achieving a competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
By January 2000, patent applications in China had exceeded one
million. Latest statistics show that about 90 percent of advanced
technologies in the world are protected by authorized patents.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Parliament to Meet on Constitutional Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkish parliament is to meet again
Wednesday afternoon to vote on a government-proposed constitutional
amendment package, which is billed as the last chance for the
president to stay in office for another term.
</P>
<P>
The package, initiated and pushed hard by Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit, got only 303 "yes" votes in the first round of voting last
Wednesday, far fewer than the minimum 330 votes required for the
bill to be legislated.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit has repeated on several occasions after the voting that
he wants the 76-year-old President Suleyman Demirel, whose single
seven-year term is to end on May, to serve another five-year term
for the sake of the country's good, describing Demirel as a "
guarantee of stability."
</P>
<P>
If the bill garners enough votes in the second round of secret
balloting, Demirel can be re-nominated as a presidential candidate
during the candidacy period of April 16-26, thus becoming the most
likely candidate to assume office.
</P>
<P>
However, if the bill still fails to get the backing of the
parliament, the search for a new candidate will begin and the
coalition partners will be faced with a different scenario.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the ruling three-party coalition reached an agreement
at Monday's summit on monitoring ballot casting by deputies during
the second round.
</P>
<P>
The poor voting last Wednesday, which triggered a confidence
crisis on Ecevit's government, was mainly attributed to the
defections by some deputies despite they had promised to vote for
Demirel beforehand.
</P>
<P>
Under the current constitution, a minimum of 330 votes in the
550-member parliament are required for the approval of any
constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
A total of 367 votes are a must for the amendment package to be
adopted by the parliament. If the number of votes remains somewhere
in between 330 and 367, a referendum will be attached to the
procedure.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Reformists Push for Cabinet Reshuffle: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran's reformists are pressing
President Mohammad Khatami to reshuffle the cabinet by removing
ministers who are not fully cooperating with them, the conservative
daily Tehran Times said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Following the overwhelming victory in the parliamentary election
on February 18, the reformist Islamic Iran Participation Front
(IIPP) has put cabinet reshuffle on its agenda, an informed source
told the daily.
</P>
<P>
The source said that the proposed reshuffle would include Vice
President for Executive Affairs Mohammad Hashemi, Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi, Education Minister Hossein Mozaffar and
Construction Jihad Minister Mohammad Saeedi-Kiya.
</P>
<P>
The current cabinet, formed in August 1997, is a coalition of
the IIPP, the centrist Party of Constructive Executives of Iran
(PCEI) and the leftist Assembly of Combatant Clergy in Tehran
(ACC), which helped Khatami win the presidential election in 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, relations between reformists and centrists soured
before the February parliamentary election as the former strongly
opposed the candidacy of former President Hashemi Rafsanjani while
latter supported him.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Times quoted unidentified source as saying that the
centrist wanted to replace Mohammad Hashemi, Rafsanjani's brother,
with Mohammad Ali Najafi, current vice president and head of the
Plan and Budget Organization.
</P>
<P>
Both Hashemi and Najafi are members of the PCEI, which was
headed by disgraced former Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi.
</P>
<P>
Hashemi strongly blasted the reformists for their opposition to
Rafsanjani's candidacy before the parliamentary election. His harsh
words won conservatives' support for Rafsanjani, but caused more
people to drop their support for Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, the current chairman of the powerful advisory State
Expediency Council, barely won a seat in the parliament in Tehran
constituency.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Times named Deputy Foreign Minister for Arab and African
Affairs Mohammad Sadr and Iran's ambassador to France as the
reformists' favorites to enter the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
However, so far the IIPF, headed by Mohammad Reza Khatami, the
president's younger brother, has not officially announced any
reshuffle plan.

<HEADLINE> DPRK, Japan Begin Normalization Talks in Pyongyang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) and Japan started their ninth round of talks here
Wednesday over normalizing of diplomatic ties between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese official, who asked not to be named, told reporters
after the morning session that the DPRK delegation "called for
settling of the historical account, and sought apology and
compensation" from Japan.
</P>
<P>
Jong Thae Hwa, who heads the DPRK's delegation, was quoted as
saying, "All our people are closely watching the talks, and we
want to lead the talks to success in line with their hopes."
</P>
<P>
Kojiro Takano, who leads the Japanese side, repeated Japan's
apology, but again rejected any compensation during the session
this morning.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK delegation declined to comment on the talks.
</P>
<P>
This round of talks is expected to last three days, to be
followed by two more rounds scheduled for Tokyo and then Beijing
or another country.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK and Japan began their normalization talks in the late
1980s, with eight round of talks held before they were suspended
in 1992.

TOKYO, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices fell in Tokyo Wednesday,
dragged down by high-priced information and technology issues
which were dampened by Tuesday's decline on Wall Street.

<HEADLINE> First Radioactive Waste Arrives in Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The first load of radioactive
nuclear waste arrived Wednesday morning at Mol in the Belgian
Province of Antwerp, which met with protests by dozens of people
against the dangerous transport.
</P>
<P>
The shipment came by train from the nuclear recycling plant of
La Hague in northern France. The container with 400 kilograms of
vitrified nuclear waste will be loaded onto a truck and taken to
the nearby town of Dessel for storage.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Belgian government had agreed to a first shipment
of nuclear waste from the reprocessing plant in France to Mol.
</P>
<P>
Environmental organization Greenpeace and three Belgian towns,
Mol, Geel and Dessel, who said last week they would ban the
transport of the highly toxic waste on their territories, failed
to obtain a court injunction stopping the transport for security
reasons.
</P>
<P>
In another Belgian town Dendermonde, the planned transport of
highly radioactive nuclear waste was successfully stopped by a
judge, who stopped the train on the territory of the town in the
Province of East Flanders.
</P>
<P>
The judge agreed with an injunction of Greenpeace that relevant
safety measures were inadequate.

<HEADLINE> Chinese to Watch Comet without Telescopes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese will have a chance to see
a comet without using a telescope in late July, according to today
's Wenhui Daily.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Sichao, a researcher at the Nanjing's Purple
Mountain Observatory attached to the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
the comet, called "Nilier," is probably the only one that will be
visible to the naked eye this decade.
</P>
<P>
The comet was discovered by an astronomy research group at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology on September 27 last year,
and it is thought to be non-periodic and revolving along a
hyperbolic orbit.
</P>
<P>
Called "passing traveler" by astronomers, the comet will never
be seen again from Earth after this, its first appearance.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the comet will begin to approach the Earth next month,
and will be 56 million kilometers from us at its closest point.
</P>
<P>
During the mornings from late May to early July, stargazers
will be able to observe the comet by ordinary telescopes, and by
late July it will be visible in the north sky without the aid of a
telescope.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the best time to observe the comet will be on the
morning of July 16.

of guilt and offenses no longer subject to prosecution due to the
statute of limitations are the three possibilities that could back
the police to close the file.
</P>
<P>
The police are expected to formulate their recommendations by
the end of the week and transfer the file to the Attorney-General's
Office and the State Prosecutors Office for a final decision.
</P>
<P>
The investigation against Weizman was touched off by
investigative reporter Yoav Yitzhak on December 30, 1999. Yitzhak
said in a press conference that Weizman had received some 453,000
U.S. dollars from Edouard Saroussi in monthly payments of various
accounts.
</P>
<P>
The money was allegedly deposited into a trust account managed
by a mutual friend of Weizman and Saroussi, attorney Hanina
Brandes, and from there the money was moved to accounts held by
Weizman and his family members.
</P>
<P>
Yitzhak also claimed that Weizman had not reported this income
to the income tax authority and that he had also allegedly violated
a law that forbids public servants from receiving gifts.
</P>
<P>
On January 12, 2000, Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein and
State Prosecutor Edna Arbel ordered a police "examination" of the
allegations. Five days later, following the discovery of a document
showing that Weizman and Saroussi had maintained unreported
business connections, they upgraded the examination into a full-
fledged criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
However, it later emerged that their business connection had
terminated before Weizman began to receive the money, thus ruling
out a possible bribery charge. The investigation therefore focused
on possible tax violations and a possible breach of the gift-taking
clause of the Public Service Law.
</P>
<P>
A senior judicial source said that whatever tax violations there
may have been were technical in character and did not warrant an
indictment.
</P>
<P>
Weizman's office refused to comment on this issue Wednesday,
saying only that the president will accept whatever the police have
recommended.
</P>
<P>
Weizman has been questioned by the police investigation team
several times and he repeatedly told the police that the money he
received was from a close family friend and the money has been used
mainly for recovering his son's health who was badly injured during
the Israeli-Egyptian war.
</P>
<P>
Weizman also said that there was a political motive behind the
allegations and he would probe that even after the case was over.

ANKARA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>

European force, Turkey had proved the importance of its
contribution to stability and security in the region during and
after the Cold War period.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks upon 51st anniversary of foundation of North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which Turkey has been part of
since 1952.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the European Security and Defense Initiative (ESDI)
which may exclude non-EU NATO members, Demirel said that "with its
contributions, it is clear that Turkey must be involved in every
security organization that will be founded in Europe."
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- Recai Kutan, the leader of the main opposition Islamist
Virtue Party said on Tuesday that ratification of the
constitutional amendment for Demirel's second term in office will
be "quite difficult" in the second round vote to be held on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that his party would vote against the bill unless
it is appended with an article which making party closures more
difficult if not impossible.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israeli Doctors Toughen Sanctions for Higher Wage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Doctors in Israel's public sector
have stepped up their sanctions Wednesday, following Tuesday's
fruitless negotiations between Treasury wage officials and the
Israel Medical Association (IMA).
</P>
<P>
Due to the strike, which entered its 20th day Wednesday, all
public general, psychiatric, geriatric and rehabilitation hospitals
stopped working except the function of emergency rooms, intensive
care units and delivery rooms.
</P>
<P>
In addition, diagnostic institutes and mini-surgical theaters in
community health fund facilities also shut down, while salaried
specialist physicians stopped receiving patients in health fund
clinics.
</P>
<P>
Also on strike are doctors in the Health Ministry's district
health offices, family health centers, school physicians and
doctors working in all government ministries.
</P>
<P>
The IMA is struggling for a new wage contract that will restore
the amount of money lost by erosion since the old contract expired
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The IMA has asked the Treasury for statistical analyses of wage
offers or to calculate the economic effects of a change in wage
structure. IMA Chairman Yoram Blachar claims the Treasury is
willing only to give the doctors a 5 percent raise across the
board.
</P>
<P>
"The impression is that the Treasury is not willing to advance
negotiations but merely aims to tire the doctors out without
solving the problem," he told the Israel Radio.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan told Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy that he plans to help Israel implement U.N.
Security Council Resolution 425, while they were meeting in Geneva
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Levy briefed Annan on Israel's preparations for the upcoming
withdrawal from south Lebanon and told Annan that if the U.N plans
to assist in the implementation of Resolution 425, it will find
Israel to be a willing partner.
</P>
<P>
Annan indicated that the current U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon
would work to maintain quiet when Israel redeploys to the
international border with Lebanon. He added that the sides would
find a way to avoid violence and general deterioration in the
situation in the zone.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Former U.S. President Lyndon Johnson and Secretary of State
Dean Rusk, worried about a threat of nuclear proliferation in the
Middle East, pressured Israel in the mid-1960s to promise not to
develop nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
But the strategy failed, with a White House emissary sent to Tel
Aviv reporting back to Washington that Israel is a tougher
bargainer than the former Soviet Union, then archenemy of the
Americans.
</P>
<P>
Israel refused to make a commitment it considered dangerous to
its national security, according to classified documents released
Tuesday by the State Department historian's office.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- In the most volatile day ever for U.S. stocks, the Nasdaq
composite index and the Dow Jones industrial average each plunged
more than 500 points Tuesday before reversing course as buyers
flooded back into the battered market.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli investors confound fears that the local
bourse would similarly suffer sharp losses and pushed stock prices
even higher.
</P>
<P>
The blue-chip Maof 25 index gained 1.25 percent to 505.81, while
the Tel Aviv 100 index rose 1.02 percent to 498.91. Even the
Teltech index of local technology companies, which is widely
believed to be more vulnerable to developments on Nasdaq, rose 1.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Eli Yishai, chairman of the ultraorthodox religious Shas
party, Tuesday gave National Police Chief Yehuda Wilk a letter
written by Shas spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Yosef comments on his March 18 diatribe against
Education Minister Yossi Sarid in the course of a sermon in a
synagogue, which is being investigated by police.
</P>
<P>
Yosef repeated for the fifth time in the letter that he did not
intend to incite violence against Sarid.
</P>
<P>
The letter was Yosef's own initiative and it is possible that
police will accept it as testimony, sparing the rabbi from
questioning in the case.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah Lower Against U.S. Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian rupiah exchange rate
against U.S. dollar on Wednesday declined to 7,800 per U.S. dollar
from 7,500 early this week due to the slow pace of economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Some dealers even predicted that the rupiah will plunge to 8,
000 per dollar, if the working of the economic ministers does not
improve.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last month, the rupiah exchange rate against U.S.
dollar showed signs of weakening, following news that the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) would delay its aid to Indonesia
due to the government failure in implementing the economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The reforms focus on bank and corporate restructuring programs.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters before attending Cabinet meeting here
Wednesday, Governor of the Central Bank Syahril Sabirin was
optimistic that the rupiah will recover and strengthen again if
the government is successful in implementing a set of delayed key
reforms by the new April 8 deadline agreed with the IMF.
</P>
<P>
He said that the rupiah exchange rate against U.S. dollar could
go back to the level of 7,000 per dollar.
</P>
<P>
"If the deadline of April 8 is met (by the government), that
will be able to strengthen the rupiah," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sabirin also said that the rupiah also could recover if the
country is successful in asking for debt rescheduling from the
donor countries in the upcoming donors meeting.
</P>
<P>
The donor countries grouping in the Consultatives Group on
Indonesia (CGI) is due to meet in Paris on April 10-12, under
which Indonesia will ask for debt rescheduling of its foreign loan
mounting to 2.1 billion U.S. dollars for the April-December 2000
fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Reform Under Review in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's top government
officials and representatives of donor countries and international

financial institutions began a two-day quarterly meeting here
Wednesday to review the reform in the country.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the meeting will provide us with the rare
opportunity to evaluate together the results of the tremendous
efforts of the royal government of Cambodia during the past year,"
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who is presiding over the meeting, said in
his opening speech.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, we will be able to draw experiences and
lessons from the government's action. This evaluation will be used
to develop action plans and new measures aimed at pushing forward
the momentum that has been successfully established," Hun Sen
added.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the government will discuss 10 topics and
will for the first time deal with the government's new anti-
corruption and good governance measures. Other topics include
military demobilization, civil administration reform, forestry
management, fiscal reform and social sector issues.
</P>
<P>
Donor countries have urged Cambodia to take serious measures to
deal with corruption and establish good governance.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the World Bank and the government are now
preparing a good-governance action plan to be submitted to the
Consultative Group meetings in Paris next month.
</P>
<P>
This is the third quarterly donors' meeting after the
Consultative Group's gathering in Tokyo in February 1999 to
monitor and follow up the Cambodian government's implementation of
reform programs.
</P>
<P>
The last meeting was held here on October 27 in Phnom Penh.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Hopes to Become Rice Exporter by 2003 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said Wednesday that he is confident that the Philippines can
attain rice sufficiency by 2002 and even become an exporter of the
commodity by 2003.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, the president assured the people that his
administration would see to it that every Filipino family has
enough food to eat by the time he steps down from office in 2004.
</P>
<P>
"This is what we are focusing on. Perhaps by 2003, we would be
the one to export rice. We are working hard so that our food
security program would ensure that no Filipino goes hungry in his
own land," the president said in Filipino.
</P>
<P>
He said this will be realized through his administration's
continuing efforts to modernize the agriculture sector, which
includes tapping the assistance of the International Rice Research
Institute.
</P>
<P>
Food security is one of the president's five centerpiece
programs, alongside mass housing, peace and order, the fight
against graft and corruption, and electoral reforms.
</P>
<P>
The president said that aside from the record-high yields of
the agriculture sector last year, his optimism that the country
could achieve food sufficiency was further boosted by new
initiatives aimed at increasing rice production in small farms.
</P>
<P>
These, he said, include the propagation of hybrid seeds,
similar to those used in China, Vietnam and Thailand, which will
increase the present national average of paddy yields from 2.9
metric tons per hectare to 6 to 10 metric tons per hectare.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture sector expanded by over 6.5 percent in 1999 and
is expected to sustain this momentum with a growth rate of 3 to 4
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Over 40 billion pesos (1 billion U.S. dollars) has been
allocated under this year's national budget for programs and
projects in the agriculture sector.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Woo More Tourists From West Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Culture, Arts and
Tourism Minister Abdul Kadir Sheikh Fadzir is leading a tourism
promotion team to seven countries in West Asia in an effort to woo
more Arabs to visit Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
During the working visit from April 5 to 19, the team will
visit Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates (UAE),
Bahrain, Oman, Egypt and Qatar, according to Bernama news agency
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that Malaysia has carried out tourism
promotion activities in West Asia. Last year, the minister toured
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the UAE to promote the country as a tourist
destination.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has targeted to attract 200,000 visitors from the Gulf
countries by the end of this year, compared with 23,000 visitors
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the target, the Culture, Arts and Tourism Ministry
has decided to form a task force each in Dubai of the UAE, Kuwait
City in Kuwait and Jeddah in Saudi Arabia to look after and
coordinate Malaysian tourism promotion activities.
</P>
<P>
The culture and arts section of the Malaysian embassies and
consulates general in those countries has also been reactivated to
support and spearhead tourism promotion activities or initiatives.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also plans to set up a regional tourism office in
Dubai to help Malaysia attract travelers and tourists from the
Gulf states and their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
On the schedule of the tourism minister's current trip are
meetings and discussions with the Malaysian embassies in the
countries concerned, dialogue sessions with chief executive
officers of travel agencies and Malaysian multinational
corporations, Bernama said.

BANGKOK, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is now well-prepared for
hosting the Asian Development Bank (ADB) meeting, to be held in
the northern resort province of Chiang Mai next month, the Thai
News Agency (TNA) reported Wednesday.
</P>

Special Branch Commissioner of Royal Thai Police Headquarters
Yodhin Madhayomanandana was quoted as saying that in the security
area, plans to safeguard participating leaders and to tackle

Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD X), which was held in
Bangkok in February, he said.
</P>
<P>
Thai security officers are, therefore, ready for the upcoming
ADB conference, he noted.

In other areas, authorities concerned are also reportedly ready
for the meeting of the Manila-based financial institute, which is
a major support for development projects of developing countries
in the region.

<HEADLINE> Some Spaniards Visit Kanungu Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan security sources have
revealed that some Spaniards last year visited Kanungu in
southwestern Uganda where over 530 people of a cult were burnt to
death in a church fire on March 17.
</P>
<P>
State Minister for Security Muruli Mukasa, appearing before the
 parliamentary committee on presidential and foreign affairs on
Tuesday, said that the information was provided by local
residents.
</P>
<P>
Investigations are being conducted to establish the motive of
the visit, the minister was quoted by Wednesday's New Vision
daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Movement for the Restoration of Ten Commandments of God was
held responsible for the death of over 920 Ugandans revealed by
the police so far. The leaders of the cult are said to be on the
run.
</P>
<P>
Previous reports here quoted police sources as saying that the
cult had received donations from some Western countries like
France, Germany, Italy, Austria and Spain. The donations were
mainly from individuals.
</P>
<P>
However, the police have not yet established the motive of the
donations and how the donations were spent.

<HEADLINE> World Market Responsible for Tanzanian Fuel Price Hikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Zhang Dacheng
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Recent fuel price hikes in
Tanzania arose from oil price hikes in the world market and the
Tanzanian government should not be blamed, a senior World Bank
official has said.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's newspapers here quoted World Bank country
representative James Adams as saying that Tanzania's oil sector
has already been liberalized and the government could no longer
determine the market prices.
</P>
<P>
"There are issues which are within the government's control,
but the recent raising of fuel price was worldwide and would
affect not only Tanzania but many other countries on the
continent," he said.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the recent fuel prices hikes would further
increase the already high cost of doing business in the country
compared with other countries in East and Southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
However, Adams noted that some of the taxes charged by the
government on fuel are too high and needs further streamlining.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania currently imposes six different taxes on imported
petroleum products, including import duty Tanzania Petroleum
Development Corporation margins, processing fees, Road Toll,
Excise Duty, Energy Fund and Windfall Profit tax. In addition,
there is city services levy for Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian oil marketing companies have been complaining that
the government levies and taxes were behind the unpredictable
escalating prices of petroleum products, saying that all these
taxes were approximately 150 percent above the landed prices.
</P>
<P>
The consumer of the products would not enjoy anything from the
liberalization of the oil sector unless world prices drop
drastically, they said.
</P>
<P>
The fuel prices in Tanzanian pump stations last Monday rose to
a historic high, the ninth over the past few months, inflicting a
heavy blow on local consumers.
</P>
<P>
The prices of super petrol and diesel were raised by 20
Tanzanian shillings (one U.S. dollar equals 802 Tanzanian
shillings at present) up to 565 and 518 shillings per liter
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The frequent increases of fuel prices have caused serious
worries among Tanzanian transporters.
</P>
<P>
If not checked, the upward trend would cause untold sufferings
to the end-users in Tanzania as it would paralyze the sector, an
engine for national economic growth, they said.
</P>
<P>
Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Finance Peter Ngumbullu
said last week that the treasury was contemplating to review
petroleum products price structure to ensure that fuel is sold to
consumers at realistic and affordable prices.

<HEADLINE> Ten Percent Blood Donors in Dar Hospital Tested HIV Positive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 5 (Xinhua) -- One out of ten Tanzanians
volunteering to donate blood at the largest hospital in Dar es
Salaam were found to be HIV positive, the African newspaper
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a medical study conducted by the Muhimbili University
College of Health Sciences, it was revealed that 522 out of the
6,000 people who lined up for blood donation at the Muhimbili
Medical Center (MMC) last year were tested positive for HIV.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, HIV was the most prevalent cause for
blood infection, accounting for 8.7 percent of blood donation
cases at the center.
</P>
<P>
Much of the blood donated is meant for anaemic children
patients under the age of five and the screening work is vital to
avoiding the risk of an acute HIV infection, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In the countrywide, the demand for blood infusion has risen to
180,000 cases per year. Earlier, the situation at the MMC blood
bank was reported to have deteriorated to the extent that certain
blood groups were completely missing.
</P>
<P>
The HIV/AIDS infection rate in Tanzania, a country with an
estimated population of 30 million, is said to be around 10
percent. Most of the victims are in the age group of 16 to 40.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Delivers Fewer Jets in First Quarter Due to Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Boeing Co., the largest
aircraft maker in the world, Tuesday said it delivered 50 fewer
jetliners than planned in the first quarter because of delays
caused by the 40-day strike by engineers and technical workers.
</P>
<P>
Boeing had planned to deliver 125 jets, but actually only
delivered 75 jets in the first quarter. News release from the
aircraft giant said 33 jets were delivered in January but a strike
by the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace
trimmed February deliveries to 27 and March shipments to 15.
</P>
<P>
"It's great to have our engineering and technical team back.
Though we have work to make up, our planned commercial deliveries
for 2000 are less than the record output of last year," said
Boeing Chairman Phil Condit.
</P>
<P>
But Boeing still plans to deliver about 490 jetliners by year's
end as projected, down from last year's record 620, the company
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"There will be some impact in the first quarter, maybe in the
second quarter, but nothing to change our margins for the year,"
said company spokesman Larry McCracken.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 5 (Xinhua) --Three residents of Shenzhen in
south China's Guangdong Province have been given permits to work
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The three, Mu Shicheng, Ren Zengyuan and Feng Youmin, are the
first group of Chinese mainlanders to be given work permits since
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) initiated a
program last December to introduce more large-caliber talent into
the region, according to the Guangdong Provincial Public Security
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, Hong Kong-registered companies can submit
applications to the SAR government for the employment of mainland
personnel. The SAR government will sign and issue entry permits to
those who are hired, as well as to their spouses and children
under the age of 21.
</P>
<P>
Mu Shicheng has a doctorate in engineering and has been
awarded a special allowance by the State Council for his
outstanding achievements in mechanical engineering research. He
was also named a honorary senior engineer by the Siemens Company
of Germany.
</P>
<P>
Ren Zengyuan is engineer-in-chief of the Guangsha Recording
Equipment Co. Ltd. of Shenzhen, and Feng Youmin is an engineer
with the Xingqing Electronic Company of Shenzhen.

<HEADLINE> Largest Carbon Single Crystal Developed In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The largest single crystal of
Carbon 60 (C60) numerator, 1.3 centimeters at its widest, has been
developed by scientists at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou,
capital of east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the widest part of the largest single C60 crystal
in the world was only six mm.
</P>
<P>
The Institute of Condensed-Matter Physics attached to the
Department of Physics of Zhejiang University used a gas phase
method to develop this largest C60 single crystal in the world.
</P>
<P>
The C60 round numerator is a fine photo-conductivity and
lubricant material with super-conductive characteristics under low
temperatures when compounded with kalium and other metals, experts
explained.
</P>
<P>
Some experts claim that the development of this crystal is the
most important achievement in fullerene research following the
single-walled carbon nanotube in recent years.

<HEADLINE> China Marital Relations Diversified in 21st Century: Experts (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Since the early eighties, there
have been fundamental changes in marriage and family relations in
China, following the economic development and social progess.
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with Xinhua, Chen Xinxin, a well-known
marriage and family expert with the All-China Women's Federation
said that in the next 100 years, "Marriages and family all over
the world will be more diversified, men and women will be more
independent, and individual rights of family members will be
better respected."
</P>
<P>
In urban areas, she said, 60 percent of families only have
three to four members. This figure is expected to rise. More
people will marry and have children much later.
</P>
<P>
The number of single people will increase and more of them will
prefer not to have any children, she added.

<P>
Economic factors will play a lesser role in choosing a spouse
or partner, while people will pay more attention to how they will
get along, she said.
</P>
<P>
There will be less household chores with the more electrical
and smarter appliances, she said, adding family quarrels over
household chores will be less.
</P>
<P>
Higher education and more knowledge may increase people's
expectations over marriage and love, and may lead to more
misfortune, misery, and thus more divorces, she warned.
</P>
<P>
Chen stated that divorce agreements and trial divorces will be
more opted for and divorce rate will be up.
</P>
<P>
The society will be more tolerant with ultra-marital affairs,
and people's responsibility for marriage and family will come more
from self-reflection, self-discipline and self-redress than from
social pressure, she said.
</P>
<P>
With relaxation of control over people's personal affairs, more
ultra-marital affairs will appear, she predicted.
</P>
<P>
People's freedom of marriage from social pressure will increase
considerably, more will opt not to marry, and the number of single-
parent families will increase, the expert said.

<P>
However, she said, they will face strong opposition from the
traditional forces which stress on parental agreement on marriage
matters.
</P>
<P>
Early marriages and births will decrease along with the rise of
women's social status, improvement of rural economy and
establishment of a pension system, she said.
</P>
<P>
Because of poverty and maladjusted ratio of men and women, a
considerable number of male population will find it difficult to
find a wife, she warned.
</P>
<P>
Divorce will still be difficult, especially when involving the
separation of farmland, care of children, she said, noting that
women working in factories will have more say in this matter.
</P>
<P>
Extra-marital affairs will mean both a temptation and danger
for rural women, which will lead to turbulent life or even tragedy
for them, she concluded.

<HEADLINE> Consumers Cautioned Against Sub-Standard Cosmetics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese consumers are being
cautioned against smuggled and fake overseas cosmetic products
because these substances may lead to skin problems.
</P>
<P>
They are advised to examine the labels on imported products,
such as a CCIB (China Commodity Inspection Bureau) mark or the new
CIQ (China Inspection Quarantine) mark which is issued by the
State Administration for Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine,
along with the dates of production and expiration, and the
instructions in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Chinese are expected to spend 32.2 billion yuan (about 3.88
billion U.S. dollars) on cosmetics this year, and in rich areas,
imports are always favored even though the prices are often much
more than for domestic products.
</P>
<P>
However, the beauty industry has been hurt by smuggled, sub-
standard, and even fake cosmetics, according to a report in today'
s Guangming Daily which said that about 80 percent of imported
commodities on the shelves in south China's Guangdong Province
were found to be sub-standard during an official inspection.
</P>
<P>
Specialists with the administration said there are many quality
problems among those products, such as the use of banned additives,
and over-the-limit amounts of heavy metals and bacteria.
</P>
<P>
An eight-year study conducted by doctors at the Hebei Medical
College suggested that some imported cosmetics, especially hair
dye, can cause pathological changes in the skin, including
allergic reactions and cancer, the report said.
</P>
<P>
China's quarantine authorities have also tightened the quality
control and supervision of exported cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration for Entry-Exit Inspection and
Quarantine will authorize a group of institutions to examine the
claims on product labels, including hygiene standards and
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
Local branches of the administration have been asked to
intensify the inspection of cosmetic imports and exports, and
products failing to meet standards may be confiscated and
destroyed.

BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The rapid growth of the Internet
industry in China will have an enormous impact on China's
traditional economy, said Song Ling, director of the Information
Promotion Department of the Ministry of Information Industry in
Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
"Innovation has been a powerful engine of economic growth in
the new era," said Song. Official statistics showed that by the
end of last year, there were 520 Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
in China, while Internet Content Providers (ICPs) exceeded 1,000.
</P>
<P>
"A number of Chinese enterprises and institutes are aware of
the Internet's potential and are taking active measures to get
online," Song said.
</P>
<P>
For instance, Legend, the country's top computer manufacturer,
has already announced that it will shift its business focus to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
China's leading household electric appliances makers such as
Hai'er Group and the TCL Group are now adopting new marketing and
management strategies on the Internet.

BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- A total of 118 Chinese have been
fined or kept in custody during the latest nationwide campaign
against the illegal production and sale of fireworks.
</P>
<P>
Police have examined 870 licensed fireworks plants in seven
provinces including Hebei, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, closing more
than 80 plants which were found to have serious safety problems.
</P>
<P>
The police also shut down 547 illegal factories, 593
unauthorized retailers, and 274 materials manufacturers, while
confiscating their products and equipment.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen offenders were detained and the other 105 people were
fined.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of several massive explosions at fireworks plants,
the State Council and the Ministry of Public Security issued a
circular last week ordering immediate action against the illegal
production and sale of fireworks.
</P>
<P>
The most deadly recent explosion occurred on March 11 at a
privately owned firecracker factory in a village near Pingxiang in

<HEADLINE> More Seals Spotted in East China's Liaodong Bay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese fishermen reported seeing
hundreds of seals near Liaodong Bay in the northeast Bohai Sea
over the past winter.
</P>
<P>
Zoologists said there were 2,000 to 3,000 seals spending this
winter at Liaodong Bay as a result of the improved marine
environment in the region.
</P>
<P>
Some 30 young seals were caught by fishermen and then sent to
the local aquaculture department, where some were confirmed as
harbor seals, an animal under state-level protection.
</P>
<P>
The seals swim from north to south from December to May every
year to reproduce, and Liaodong Bay is the southernmost
reproduction site for harbor seals in the world, zoologists say.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the 1980s, harbor seals were abundant at
Liaodong Bay, and about 2,000 to 3,000 harbor seals could be found
there every year.
</P>
<P>
Because the seals prey on a large amount of fish, the fishermen
were encouraged to hunt them at that time. In addition, marine
pollution accelerate the falling number of seals.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, local departments have been urged to improve
the marine environment, and in 1992 a state-level nature reserve
for harbor seals was set up in the port city of Dalian on the bay.
Seal hunting has been forbidden since then, and the public is now
more aware of protecting this sea animal.

<HEADLINE> Iran Stops Iraqi Oil Fleet in Gulf Waters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards
have stopped a fleet carrying smuggled Iraqi oil in the Persian
Gulf, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted an unidentified source as saying the elite corps
marine patrol found on April 1 an oil fleet, registered in
Honduras, and ordered it to anchor.
</P>
<P>
The fleeting, named "al-Masroo," was carrying 2,500 tons of
smuggled oil from the Iraq, the source said. It is now in the
waters off the southern coast of Iran, with its 18 crew members
under the command of Captain Qassem Abdul Qader, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not give more details about the
incident, nor did it reveal the destination of the fleet.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two neighbors again soured in the past
months as they accused each other of sheltering rebel groups which
carried out terror attacks in both Tehran and Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, under U.N. sanctions since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
has been banned from selling its on the open market. Starting from
1996, it was allowed to sell limited amounts of oil under the U.N.
oil-for-food program to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian
supplies for its 22 million people.
</P>
<P>
But the United States and its allies has repeatedly accused
Baghdad of smuggling refined oil out of its Basra and Abu Flus
ports.
</P>
<P>
A Multinational Interception Force has been patrolling the Gulf
since 1990 to make sure tankers don't violate the sanctions. But
its
ships and aircraft can only patrol international waters in the
center of the Gulf, thus leaving the door open for oil smugglers.

<HEADLINE> Australia Raises Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Reserve Bank
Wednesday lifted interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point
to 5.75 percent, from 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bank said inflationary concerns over the medium term,
rather than the current strength of the economy, was behind its
decision to increase interest rates.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time in five months that the central bank has
tightened its monetary policy. In February, the bank raised the
interest rate by 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
A further rise in the coming months is expected.
</P>
<P>
An economist was quoted by AAP as saying, "There are inflation
risks from the tightening labor market, stronger global growth and
domestic growth, the Australian dollar in its depressed state
would also be a consideration."
</P>
<P>
Inflationary pressure is evident in some sectors, such as wages,
household credit and oil prices, Australian analysts pointed out.
</P>
<P>
However, Treasurer Peter Costello warned Wednesday against any
lenders raising interest rates by more than 0.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
"There are no grounds for any bank or other home lender to move
their rates up by more than 0.25 percent and I will be watching
them very, very carefully, I can assure you of that," he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Inflation Rate Picks Up in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Year-on-year inflation rate in the
Philippines rose to 3.3 percent in March from 3 percent in
February,although it was lower than the 8.7 percent in March 1999,
the National Statistics Office said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the office, higher prices of items in all
commodity groups contributed to the increase in the inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
The rates for food, beverages and tobacco went up to 0.7
percent in March from a negative 0.6 percent in February while
those for fuel, light and water jumped to 9.2 percent from 9
percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, inflation in services remained at the February rate
of 11.4 percent, the office said.
</P>
<P>
By region, the inflation rate for the national capital area
increased from 2.8 percent in February to 3.2 percent in March,
the highest in the region since October last year.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the inflation rate in areas outside the
capital region went up to 3.4 percent in March from 3.1 percent in
the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of the Philippines said earlier that it would
keep the country's interest rate unchanged if the inflation rate
was below 4 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
The country's overnight borrowing rate now stands at 8.75
percent while the overnight lending rate is 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
Labor and Employment Secretary Blenvenido Laguesma reassured
the public that the government will continue to explore ways to
keep prices of basic commodities stable and inflation from
shooting up.
</P>
<P>
For the whole of 1999, the country's inflation rate averaged 6.
6 percent, mainly due to the agriculture sector's remarkable
turnaround which grew by 6.5 percent in the year.
</P>
<P>
The government has set an inflation target of 6 to 7 percent
for 2000, a goal most analysts believe is achievable.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Australia saw a turnaround in its
trade last year following the East Asian economic crisis although
it still suffered a 980 million U.S. dollar deficit.
</P>
<P>
A government's trade statement for 1999 issued Wednesday shows
a rising trend of total exports in each of the last eight months
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Trade Minister Mark Vaile said the positive trend continued in
January and February this year.
</P>
<P>
Services and manufacturing exports each increased by 6 percent,
with transport equipment up 22 percent due to a strong growth in
passenger vehicle exports.
</P>
<P>
Despite the export recovery later in the year, total goods and
services exports dropped by 0.4 percent to 69.1 billion U.S.
dollars for the year.
</P>
<P>
Treasurer Costello said Wednesday that the strengthening world
economy will bring its advantages for Australia.

"It means that our exports will find better prices and better
volumes," he was quoted by AAP as saying.

<P>
HARARE, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Home Affairs Minister
Dumiso Dabengwa Tuesday night appealed to leaders of all
political parties to restrain their members from engaging in
violent activities.
</P>
<P>
He warned in a statement that the opposition Movement for

</P>
<P>
The police are thoroughly investigating the threats and the
government will take all necessary actions to foil the strategy,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The police are, therefore, under instruction to deal with
violent elements impartially and decisively without fear or favor
of any political party," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Dabengwa, the Ministry of Home Affairs is urgently
 considering various strict measures to deal with public
demonstrations until the completion of the general elections in
May.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Opposition Leader Charged with Stealing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of
Tanzania's opposition Civic United Front (CUF) Seif Sharif Hamad
and seven others Tuesday appeared in a regional magistrate court
in Zanzibar, being charged with stealing with violence, the
Guardian newspaper reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Reading charges against Hamad and his colleagues, the
prosecutor, Inspector of Police Aziz Juma, alleged that the
accused attacked members of the Police Force viciously and were
involved in the theft of a sub-machine gun with 10 rounds of
bullets last Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
He said that several policemen who were attacked by the accused
 sustained serious injuries and were admitted to Mnazi Mmoja
hospital.
</P>
<P>
All the accused were released on a 28 million Tanzanian
shillings (about 35,000 U.S. dollars) bail bond and the case was
adjourned until 18 April.
</P>
<P>
The CUF, Tanzania's main opposition party, refuses to recognize
Zanzibar President Salmin Amour's 1995 election in which Hamad
lost by less than 1 percent amid allegations of ballot-rigging.
</P>
<P>
Authorities in the Indian Ocean archipelago have been accusing
Hamad's party of hatching a scheme to oust Amour after the vote.
</P>
<P>
Though it joined with Tanganyika to form the nation of Tanzania
in 1964, Zanzibar is a semiautonomous state with its own
government and parliament.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Researchers Map Rice Genome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Researchers at the Seattle-
based University of Washington have decoded the genetic make-up of
rice, the university said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"This will give scientists the potential to dramatically
improve the production of rice, a vital food source for half of
the world's population," said the university in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Monsanto Company, a leading provider of agricultural solutions
to growers worldwide, financed the research project that also
tested a method for rapidly sequencing large genomes.
</P>
<P>
The company said Tuesday in a separate statement that it will
share its data with researchers throughout the world. "This will
enable the world's scientific community to greatly accelerate the
development of more nutritious and higher yielding rice," Monsanto
said.
</P>
<P>
It is also expected to lead to similar developments in other
major food crops including corn, wheat, barley, sorghum and millet,
said the company.
</P>
<P>
Rice is the largest genome and first plant to be mapped in a
working draft form, according to the researchers who made the
breakthrough in decoding the genetic make-up of rice. Rice is
important because it is a model species for learning about traits
such as yield, hybrid vigor, and single and multigenic disease
resistance of all grass plants.
</P>
<P>
In addition, researchers said, deciphering the genetic code of
rice is expected to lead to development of new varieties of rice
that will produce greater yields, be more resistant to pests and
disease, and grow in different types of climates and soils.
</P>
<P>
Monsanto quoted the International Rice Institute as saying that
1 billion new rice consumers will be added in Asia by 2020. By
that date, 4 billion people -- more than half the world's
population -- will depend on rice.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that sharing this data will lead to many discoveries
that enhance food security throughout the developing world," said
the Monsanto Company, which undertook this rice genome sequencing
project in support of its ongoing crop research and development
programs.

<HEADLINE> Largest Debt-Equity Swap Agreement in Ningxia Signed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Lingwu Bureau of Mines in
northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region signed an
agreement here Tuesday with its creditor, Xinda Assets Management
Company of China, to swap 1.034 billion yuan of debt for equities.
</P>
<P>
This was the largest debt-equity swap ever signed in Ningxia,
said a regional government official.
</P>
<P>
The Lingwu Bureau of Mines is a large state-owned enterprise in
Ningxia with total assets of 1.99 billion yuan, and the company
had sales revenues of 299 million yuan last year. However, the
mine has a high asset liability ratio as a result of
overproduction and a slide in coal prices.
</P>
<P>
In view of the fact that Lingwu has proven reserves of 27.3
billion tons of low-phosphate, low-sulfur, and high-energy coal,
the local government has adopted a series of measures including
closing small coal mines and offering preferential treatments to
help the enterprise out of difficulties.
</P>
<P>
This debt-equity swap helps Lingwu cut down its bank interest
by 71 million yuan.

<HEADLINE> Holiday Inn Downtown leads Hotels In Room Occupancy Rate in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Holiday Inn Downtown Beijing was
recently announced by the Beijing Tourism Bureau to top the
ranking of hotel room occupancy rate among tourism hotels in
Beijing for 1999.
</P>
<P>
The hotel has topped the ranking for eight years in a row,
since it became one of the Holiday Inn's chains in 1992. Its
averaged hotel room occupancy rate stood above 85 percent in the
1992-1999 period.
</P>
<P>
"Holiday Inn's brandname attraction and its management
mechanism have played an indispensable role for the success," said
Yang Shaohua, the hotel president.
</P>
<P>
The Holiday Inn has a chain of over 2,400 hotels in some 60
countries. Its parent company, Bass Plc, owns another two luxury
hotel chains, Inter-Continental and Crown Plaza hotel chains. Bass
is currently expanding its hotel network in the Asia-Pacific
region. The Holiday Inn now has 25 chains in China.
</P>
<P>
The four-star rank hotel in Beijing with 346 rooms earned 80
million yuan from sales last year. The net profit amounted to 25
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Hu Minkang, general manager of the hotel, expressed his hope
that China should build its own hotel conglomerates. He said that
Jianguo Hotel in Beijing and White Swan Hotel in Guangzhou are
making such endeavor to establish a unique management style in
preparations for expansion. However, they are still at an initial
stage.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, the number of tourist hotels in China had
totaled 5,728 with nearly 250 of them being luxury hotels. In
Beijing alone, there are some 50 luxury hotels.

<HEADLINE> China Continues to Ban Pyramid Schemes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- China began a three-month campaign
this month to ban the long-prohibited pyramid schemes, which have
staged a comeback recently in some places in the country.
</P>
<P>
A circular released by the State Administration of Industry and
Commerce requires that local administrations at various levels
keep a close watch on all kinds of pyramid-type sales, especially
those in disguised form.
</P>
<P>
Notoriously fraudulent pyramid sales were abolished by the
State Council, China's cabinet, when it issued the "Notice on
Prohibition of Pyramid Sales" in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
"However, such schemes in disguised forms, such as sales in
chain stores and via the Internet have popped up again, and seem
to be spreading fast," said an official with the administration.
</P>
<P>
Pyramid schemes deceive people into buying things, mostly fake
products, and have caused severe damage. Some of them in disguised
form even promote superstition among sales personnel, posing a
threat to social order and stability.
</P>
<P>
"These lucrative and quick-yielding schemes have lured many
into fraud and their revival will be severely dealt with," he
added.

<HEADLINE> China to Use "Dry-Water" in Afforestation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- China will import "dry-water" this
year for trial use in the afforestation of the country's western
region, an official with the State Forestry Administration (SFA)
said here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the product, called Driwater, will first be used
in the provinces of Qinghai, Gansu and Shaanxi, and the autonomous
regions of Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia, areas largely arid land

which will irrigate plants or seedlings over a fixed period of
time.

<HEADLINE> China-made Down Jackets Report Good Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- China has become a major exporter
of down jackets, and these products have achieved relatively good
quality, according to a recent random examination.
</P>
<P>
The spot check, conducted by the State Bureau of Quality and
Technical Supervision (SBQTS) among 74 producers of down products
across China, show that 78.4 percent met state standards, and all
the down jackets produced by large state-owned enterprises were
qualified.
</P>
<P>
China's production of down products began in the mid-1970s, and
since then has witnessed rapid development. Currently, China has
more than 1,600 down jacket manufacturers, and among these over
100 are engaged in large-scale production.
</P>
<P>
China-made down jackets are exported to the United States,
Japan, and Europe.
</P>
<P>
However, the examination found some problems in the products
made by private enterprises, which were urged by the SBQTS to

<HEADLINE> Desertification Due To Increased Dust Storms in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Meteorological experts point out
that the desertification of northwestern China is the major cause
of increased dust storms in north China this spring.
</P>
<P>
They said strong winds were not the "chief cause" of four dust
storms over the past month in Beijing and other part of north
China as some people believed.
</P>
<P>
Desertification prevention experts from the State Forestry
Administration said that though Beijing and Tianjin have made
enormous efforts in planting trees and vegetation, worsening
desertification in northwest China has posed threats of dust
storms to the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
In Zhangjiakou, Hebei, a province neighboring Beijing, several
deserts blow nearly one million tons of sand to Beijing each year.
</P>
<P>
An official with the State Forestry Administration said China
will accelerate afforestation in Inner Mongolia plateau and build
three big forestry farms in Hebei Province to form a "green
shelter" for Beijing and Tianjin. The dust storm that swept
through Beijing in late March killed three construction workers.

<HEADLINE> China to Regulate Grassroots Legal Service Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Minister of Justice Gao
Changli has signed decrees issuing two regulations on the
operations of government-funded grassroots legal service agencies,
and on the qualifications of their employees.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will hold the first national examination of the
professional qualifications of lawyers and others who work for
these agencies, the ministry said in a press release today.
</P>
<P>
The so-called grassroots legal service agencies are operated by
judicial departments across the country to provide both paid and
free legal services to the public, including legal aid to the poor.
</P>
<P>
There are 119,000 legal service workers in 35,000 grassroots
agencies, which are located in 74 percent of the country's rural
towns and in neighborhood communities in cities. In 1999, these
people served as regular legal consultants for 400,000 enterprises,
institutions, and individuals.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the ministry, last year, these
legal service workers handled 1.86 million cases, mediated in 1.06
million disputes, help notarized 2.75 million legal documents,
providing legal consultations to 11.83 million, and avoid or
recovered economic losses of 14 billion yuan for the parties
involved.
</P>
<P>
The two regulations provide for the establishment, operating
mechanism, and management of grassroots legal service agencies,
and ensure the qualifications of legal service workers, their
rights and responsibilities, as well as methods of management and
supervision of their work.
</P>
<P>
Punishments were also included in the regulations which will be
imposed on legal service workers who violate rules and discipline.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that the ministry will see to it that local
grassroots agencies conduct training programs on the new
regulations and shakeup their organizations accordingly.

bags (90 kgs per bag) of maize by September this year to fight
the looming hunger in some parts of the country due to severe
drought.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Agriculture Minister Chris Obure made the remarks in the
capital Nairobi Tuesday when he launched this year's Freedom From
Hunger Walk aimed at promoting food security, which is scheduled
for May 20, Kenya media reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said his government had no other alternative other than to
import the cereals to recover the shortfall before next harvest.
</P>
<P>
Obure said persistent drought in North Eastern and Eastern
Provinces and parts of Central Province has brought about
agonizing moments for many households and poses a serious
challenge to his ministry and the government.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the country's National Cereal and Produce
Board had " substantial commercial stocks of maize" which was
being off-loaded as famine relief under the direction of the
Office of the President.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the World Food Program (WFP) office in Nairobi has
launched an emergency appeal for 43.4 million U.S. dollars to
feed hungry Kenyans in the next three months as over 75,000 tons
of food is urgently needed for an estimated 2.7 million hungry
Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
WFP Information Officer Lindsey Davies said statistics gathered
earlier in the year indicated that more people are at risk of
starving in the east African nation than has been reported.

<HEADLINE> Largest U.S. Bank to Deliver Online Financial Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Bank of America, the largest
bank in the United States, said Tuesday that it is teaming with e-
business software maker Ariba to create an Internet-based
financial marketplace to provide financial services.
</P>
<P>
The online services include payment, financing, wire transfers
and purchasing services. The financial firm will use Ariba
technology to build Bank of America Marketplace, a new company
that will launch and run the business-to-business (B2B)
marketplace for the bank's 2 million business customers.
</P>
<P>
Bank of America said the marketplace will provide electronic
invoicing, extensive payments capabilities and a foreign money
exchange. The alliance will gather the bank's roughly 7 billion U.
S. dollars in yearly worldwide purchasing from outside suppliers
and streamline its procurement process.
</P>
<P>
"The digital space needs more financial capabilities," the bank
said in a statement. "The B2B market is greatly outpacing the
online credit card payment market. With this alliance we will try
and meet these financial needs and others."
</P>
<P>
The number of online marketplaces has been growing rapidly in
the United States over the past four weeks. Last month, the Big
Three U.S. automakers of General Motors, Ford and DiamlerChrysler,
as well as Toyota, Nissan and Fiat, jointly announced a B2B
integrated supplier exchange through a single portal.
</P>
<P>
About the same time, four of the world's largest aerospace and
defense companies -- Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and British
Aerospace -- also said that they would connect industry suppliers
and buyers via the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Yoshiro Mori Named Japan's New Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Yoshiro Mori, newly elected
president of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), was
elected Wednesday new Japanese prime minister by the Diet (
parliament).
</P>
<P>
Mori, 62, who was elected the LDP president earlier in the day,
gained 335 of the 488 valid votes at a plenary session of the 500-
member House of Representatives with the support of the LDP and
its two coalition partners, the New Komeito party and the newly
launched Conservative Party, which split from the Liberal Party (
LP).
</P>
<P>
In the 252-member House of Councilors, Mori garnered 137 of 244
valid votes.
</P>
<P>
Mori, leader of a major LDP faction, succeeded ailing Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi to become Japan's 55th prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi has been in a coma after suffering a stroke Sunday.
</P>
<P>
All cabinet ministers are to be retained under the new premier,
and the Mori cabinet will be launched in the evening after an
imperial attestation ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the three ruling coalition parties are then
scheduled to hold talks to confirm their policy accords, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The Mori cabinet is expected to strive toward passing bills
related to Japan's national budget for fiscal 2000 so as to seek
an economic recovery, and to push for a successful July summit of
the Group of Eight (G-8) most industrialized nations in Okinawa
Prefecture, in line with the policies of Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
After being elected the LDP head, Mori told a meeting of the
LDP lawmakers held at party headquarters that he will strive to
get the Japanese economy back onto a growth path.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 5 (Xinhua) -- There is no change in the condition
of Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, who has been in a coma
since Sunday after suffering a stroke, acting Prime Minister Mikio
Aoki said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"There has not been any change in the prime minister's
condition since yesterday," Aoki told a news conference Wednesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Aoki denied remarks by a senior member of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) that Obuchi is showing "signs of recovery."
</P>
<P>
"That has not been confirmed. We have heard from the hospital
that the premier's condition has not changed," Aoki said.
</P>
<P>
Tamisuke Watanuki, leader of the LDP's Obuchi faction,
reportedly told fellow faction members that Obuchi's brain waves
were fine and his hands were moving, after he visited Obuchi at a
Tokyo hospital on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi was hospitalized early Sunday after suffering a stroke
at his official residence. He was moved to the hospital's
intensive care unit and put on a respirator after his condition
worsened Sunday night.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: On-line Share Trading Brings Little Benefit Without Tech Support By Ou Sa and Chen Yu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Many stock brokers in Hong Kong
have launched on-line share trading service since no more than two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, the service, which implies efficiency and low cost,
will disappoint customers without technological support, experts
said.
</P>
<P>
"Many stock brokers in Hong Kong claim they can offer such kind
of service," said Douglas Chen, chief executive officer of SHK
Online, an Internet venture of Hong Kong's Property giant, SHK Co.
Ltd.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the fact that many Internet stock trading
services in Hong Kong are only E-mail based systems -- whereby a
brokerage staff, after receiving a client's order via the Internet
or a closed computer system, still needs to manually post that
order on the market system for execution.
</P>
<P>
Confirmation, settlement and several other steps in processing
the order also have to be handled manually by the broker with such
systems.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, brokers who are not participants of the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange will need to pass on the order to an Exchange
participant for execution.
</P>
<P>
In such cases, on-line dealing is not very different from
traditional ways of placing orders by phone, fax or in person.
</P>
<P>
By August this year, when the Exchange is expected to launch
the third generation of the automatic order matching and execution
system (AMS/3), the Internet orders can be directly fed into the
Exchange's trading system without manual input.
</P>
<P>
But still, "without a highly automatic system, the broker
cannot enable the customers to enjoy the benefit of AMS/3, which
has the capacity of handling one order each second," said Felix
Miao, deputy chief executive officer of the CASH on-line, Inc.
</P>
<P>
What really influences the speed of processing an order hinges
on the broker's own system rather than the Exchange's system,
according to Miao.
</P>
<P>
CASH on-line, Inc. a member of the Celestial Asia Securities
Holdings Limited CASH), is looking forward to the launch of the
AMS/3, which will be able to remove the last manual step in its on-
line share trading system.
</P>
<P>
Technology is equally important for other means of trading
stocks.
</P>
<P>
With an advanced on-line trading system and the launch of AMS/3,
using Internet terminals instead of telephones, the account
executives in the broker's branches can help conduct trade for
their clients more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
But experts said that even if all the brokers in Hong Kong
could provide on-line share trading service with necessary
technology back-up, the business will still be just one of the
forms of serving people's investment needs and cannot replace
other ways of trading, especially trading at branches, in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
First, people have their own preference to choose the way of
trading. The special personal environment at branches where people
can communicate with the account executives and other investors
face-to-face cannot be duplicated on-line.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the gap between the cost for on-line and other forms
of trading stocks is not wide in Hong Kong right now.
</P>
<P>
On-line share trading has a huge room of growth with about 1.7
million Internet users but there are fewer than 16,000 on-line
stock trading users currently in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
CASH, being the first participant of the Exchange to open on-
line service, has planned to spend 70 million HK dollars (about
nine million U.S.dollars) investing in technological development
this year.
</P>
<P>
SHK Online has set up recently partnership with the U.S. on-
line broker Web Street Securities to develop services of on-line
trading of U.S. securities for Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
Tai Fook On-line Services Limited, which jumped on the wagon no
more than three months ago, has just set up an e-wealth club for
its on-line services users to promote the business.
</P>
<P>
"We have to invest in technology, we have to upgrade, we have
to identify more and more ways to serve as many people as possible,
otherwise, we cannot survive," said CASH's Miao.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: ADB, Bangladesh to Strengthen Cooperation in Poverty Alleviation By Chen Jian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Asian Development Bank (ADB)
President Tadao Chino's three-day visit to Bangladesh ended
Tuesday. During his stay, the ADB and Bangladesh signed a Poverty
Reduction Partnership Agreement, which will help further
strengthen the cooperation between the two sides in poverty
alleviation.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, which is the first of its kind signed by
the ADB with a developing member of the bank, Bangladesh became a
model country to implement the ADB's new Poverty Reduction
Strategy first, which signifies the importance the ADB attaches to
the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the Bangladeshi government will
strive to achieve universal primary education by the year 2010,
and reduce maternal and infant mortality rates by 75 percent and
65 percent respectively by 2010.
</P>
<P>
It also aims to lower the proportion of malnourished children
by 40 percent by 2010, and make reproductive health services
available to all women of appropriate age by that year.
</P>
<P>
To support these goals, the ADB plans to lend up to 500 million
U.S. dollars annually to Bangladesh. Most of the loans will be on
a concessional basis subject to resource availability and country
performance.
</P>
<P>
The ADB assistance will support poverty reduction through
interventions in agriculture and rural development, primary health
and nutrition, basic education, water resource management, road
and rail transportation, power and energy, urban development and
the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
The assistance will promote the three pillars of the ADB's
poverty reduction strategy: pro-poor economic growth, social
development and good governance.
</P>
<P>
The ADB president, while briefing newsmen here Tuesday, said
the ADB, as the largest multilateral provider of development funds
for Bangladesh, has extended 132 loans to the country, totaling
nearly 6 billion dollars, and grants for 257 technical assistance
projects, totaling 156 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Chino praised the government's micro-credit policy,
particularly the poverty alleviation program during his talks with
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. He lauded various reform measures
adopted by the government in the economic sector and appreciated
the government's proper tackling of the 1998 floods.
</P>
<P>
Hasina asked the ADB president to consider the objective
situation of a country while making any reforms, expressing the
hope that the ADB would take into consideration her government's
programs for poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Chino also held talks with some civil society
representatives. Speaking at a meeting with the Bangladesh
Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry, he said his bank
has initiated a new private sector development strategy, promoting
the creation of enabling environment, generation of business
opportunities in the private sector and extension of catalytic
support to private sector projects through fund providing.
</P>
<P>
The ADB is committed to further strengthening the development
partnership between the two sides for the overarching goal of
poverty reduction, Chino said.

<HEADLINE> "One Country, Two Systems" Successful in Hong Kong, Tung Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TORONTO, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of China, said
here Tuesday that Hong Kong has made a success of the concept of "
one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has met two challenges "almost simultaneously" since
the handover in 1997. "The first was political, and that was how
to make a success of the untested concept of 'one country, two
systems'," Tung told more than 900 guests at a business luncheon
in the Metro Toronto Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who has been to Hong Kong since the handover can see
that 'one country, two systems' has been transformed from a
concept into an everyday reality," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is working well. We have been given maximum support from
our national leaders. At the same time, it has been made clear
time and again, that it is up to us in Hong Kong to chart our own
course," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Our political structure is evolving in accordance with the
provisions of the Basic Law," which provides a constitutional
framework for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Tung
said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to high-profile constitutional cases, hundreds of
thousands of cases are dealt with in the same way as before the
handover every year, according to the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong also takes pride in meeting the second challenge, "
that was how for Hong Kong to achieve a recovery from the longest
recession in our history brought upon us by the Asian financial
crisis," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
In two successive budgets, Hong Kong introduced tax cuts and
freezes or reductions in government fees and charges as a means to
encourage consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
"We also decided to proceed with massive investments in
infrastructure such as roads, railways and schools, not only as a
means to stimulate the economy but also as a way to build a better
future for our community," he said.
</P>
<P>
With the recovery of the regional economy in Asia, and the
strength of economy in North America, Hong Kong's economy is now
rebounding strongly, Tung told the gathering.

<HEADLINE> Yoshiro Mori Elected New Japanese Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Yoshiro Mori, newly elected
president of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), was
elected Wednesday new Japanese prime minister by both houses of
the Diet (parliament).
</P>
<P>
Mori, 62, who was elected LDP president earlier in the day,
succeeded ailing Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi to become Japan's 55
th prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi has been in a coma after suffering a stroke Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mori, leader of a major LDP faction, was elected prime minister
by a wide margin at plenary sessions of both houses with the
support of the LDP and its two coalition partners, the New Komeito
party and the newly launched Conservative Party.
</P>
<P>
All cabinet ministers are to be retained under the new premier,
and the Mori cabinet will be launched in the evening after an
imperial attestation ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the three ruling coalition parties are then
scheduled to hold talks to confirm their policy accords, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Mori, who got to know Obuchi when they were studying at a
university in Tokyo, has been a staunch supporter of Obuchi and
has helped strengthen the party's ties with New Komeito.
</P>
<P>
He was named LDP secretary general in 1998 when Obuchi took
office as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Before becoming secretary general, Mori served as LDP General
Council chief and the party's top policy-maker.
</P>
<P>
From 1983, Mori served many posts in the Japanese cabinet such
as education minister, international trade and industry minister
and construction minister.
</P>
<P>
A native of Ishikawa Prefecture on the Japan Sea coast, Mori
joined the Sankei Shimbun, a leading Japanese daily, in 1960 and
has been elected to the House of Representatives 10 times since
1969.
</P>
<P>
Mori and Obuchi have known each other since the late 1950s when
they belonged to a debating club at Waseda University in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Mori's influence in the LDP has grown as the party has placed a
high priority on maintaining a solid working relationship with New
Komeito, one of LDP's coalition partners.

<HEADLINE> Handover Ceremony Hall in Macao Might Be Preserved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, April 5 (Xinhua) -- A group of architectural specialists
are assessing the solidity of the hall in which the Chinese and
Portuguese governments held the ceremony for Macao's power
transfer on December 20 last year.
</P>
<P>
The assessment is conducted in response to the public appeal
that the historic structure should be preserved well permanently.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several months, streams of tourists and local
residents have flocked to the site to relish the atmosphere of
that solemn historic event which became a turning point for Macao.
Portuguese rule in Macao ended and the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) of China was founded right after the
handover ceremony.
</P>
<P>
From January 28 up to March 28, the hall had accommodated the
presents given to the Macao SAR by China's provincial governments
and the Hong Kong SAR government. The presents were given to
celebrate Macao's return to the motherland. During the two months,
as many as 220,000 people visited the hall and viewed the presents
with admiration.
</P>
<P>
With the conclusion of the exhibition, the SAR government
invited some architectural specialists from the inland areas of
China to study the feasibility of permanent preservation of the
hall.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with a Sino-Portuguese agreement, the hall had
been designed to be a temporary building and would be disassembled
after the handover ceremony. However, the steelwork and ceiling
were made solid enough to ensure the security of heads of states
of both countries and dignitaries from around the world.
</P>
<P>
Initial assessment showed that the hall's steelwork and ceiling
do not pose significant safety problems, but part of the walls and
floor might need replacement or reinforcement.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 5 (Xinhua) -- India's Central Bureau of
Investigation (CBI) has arrested a key conspirator in the
hijacking of the Indian Airlines flight IC-814 at the end of last
year on charges of procuring and supplying weapons to the
hijackers, the Hindu newspaper reported here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The arrested person, identified as Kumar Bhujel, was picked up
by the CBI on Monday in the state of West Bengal in northeast
India, said the Hindu.
</P>
<P>
It quoted sources as saying that Kumar Bhujel had played a "key
role" in procuring pistols, revolvers and bullets which were later
passed onto the hijackers of the IC-814 flight.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Airlines aircraft was taken by the hijackers on
December 24 after its departure from Kathmandu, Nepal, and was
held in Kandahar, Afghanistan until December 31 when the Indian
government released three jailed militants according to the demand
of the hijackers.
</P>
<P>
Hunting for suspects involved in the hijack case started across
India before the hijack drama came to an end and a dozen people
have since been arrested.

<HEADLINE> NATO Bomb Kills One Old Man in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 4 (Xinhua) -- An old man was killed in Nis on
Tuesday by a cluster bomb left over from NATO attacks last year,
adding to the worry that NATO bombs are still threatening lives of
Yugoslav people although the war ended nine months ago.
</P>
<P>
The 70-year-old Vladimir Jovanovic, a resident of the southern
Serbian city of Nis, was working in his garden when he
accidentally activated the bomb with a shovel, the media reported.
</P>
<P>
His son told reporters that a large number of cluster bombs
were dropped by NATO aircraft during its air strike on Nis last
May, and those which did not explode are now scattering in this
area. The son added that his father helped a team in search of the
unexploded bombs last autumn as a guide.
</P>
<P>
Local government officials said some bombs remained unnoticed
despite the efforts made by police and troops to clear the bombs
left over in the war. Police in Nis warned local residents to stay
away from the scene of explosion. They promised to conduct
thorough search for more unexploded bombs as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
NATO launched attacks against Yugoslavia on March 24 last year.
During the 78-day-long attack, NATO sent out more than 1,100
warplanes and dropped some 25,000 tons of explosives in 25,200
sorties or more, killing over 2,500 civilians and injuring more
than 10,000 others.

<HEADLINE> E-mail Users Increase rapidly Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The number of electronic
mailboxes soared 83 percent in 1999, reaching 569 million by the
end of last year, a study by a U.S. information service company
Messaging Online shows.
</P>
<P>
The study predicts that if e-mail accounts continue to increase
at this rate, they will outnumber both telephone and television
accounts in the next two or three years.
</P>
<P>
Of the 569 million e-mail boxes, 333 million are in the United
States, taking up about 60 percent of the total. The study says
two thirds of the workforce in the United States now uses e-mail
and one fourth of the U.S. families have at least one e-mail box.
</P>
<P>
On average, U.S. families have four e-mail boxes per household.
"It is apparent that e-mail is a new mass communications channel,"
said Messaging Online in a report, estimating that at least 40
percent of Americans use e-mail.
</P>
<P>
The study also shows that e-mail is still in an early stage of
development in countries other than the United States, although
the number of e-mail boxes rocketed 100 percent last year,
increasing from 117 million at the end of 1998 to 236 million.
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, there were only 15 million e-mail boxes in the
entire world. Since then, however, e-mail technology has spread
into both business sectors and households at a dramatic speed,
changing their ways of communication. The study shows that Webmail
and ISP online are the most popular categories of e-mail with 170
million and 149 million mailboxes in use respectively by the end
of 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV April 4, (Xinhua) -- An official with the Ukrainian
Foreign Ministry today rebuked Russia for ending the bilateral
land-delimitation negotiations without providing a good reason.
</P>
<P>
Yuri Kostenko, the Ukrainian envoy for delimitation
negotiations, expressed his uneasiness with Russia for excusing
itself from attending the 13th bilateral negotiation session
scheduled last January.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine had offered to host the session in its northeast Sumy
City several times, but the offer was declined by Russia for "
technical reasons" time and again.
</P>
<P>
Kostenko said the ministry presented a memo to the Russian
Ambassador to Kiev in February on Russia's unilateral decision to
cease negotiations, but there has been no answer from the Russian
side so far.
</P>
<P>
The two country's agreed to finish their land-delimitation
negotiations this summer when Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
visited Ukraine last October.
</P>
<P>
The envoy denied that both sides had encountered irreconcilable
problems that could disrupt the negotiations, while admitting some
differences between the two parties did exist.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Italy has requested the Albanian
government to step up its efforts to prevent illegal emigration.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Albanian Public Security Minister Spartak
Poci, visiting Italian Deputy Interior Minister Mari Tati said
Albania must take vigorous measures to prevent illegal emigration
from Albania to Italy, and that both countries should make efforts
to pursue Albanian criminals hiding in Italy.
</P>
<P>
Poci promised Tati that Albanian police authorities will make
all efforts to thwart illegal emigration to Italy from Albania's
territory.
</P>
<P>
When meeting Albanian Deputy Prime Minister Makb Ule Ceco
earlier in the day, Tati said Italy has decided to increase the
quota of legal Albanian immigrants to 6,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
For her part, Ceco urged the Italian government to accept more
Albanian immigrants and liberalize the granting of visas for
Albanians in order to prevent illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
Italy, separated from Albania by a narrow strait, has been a
major destination for illegals from Albania in recent years. Since
1992, the number of Albanians entering Italy illegally has grown
every year. For this, the Italian government has frequently urged
Albania to curb the illegal emigration to Italy.

BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- An official with the Ministry of

<HEADLINE> hke040504--Indonesian Prosecutors to Take Further Action Soeharto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Attorney General's
Office (AGO) was dissatisfied with the results of Monday's probe
into former president Soeharto's alleged corruption, the
Indonesian Observer reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We will evaluate the results of Monday's probe and determine
what actions to take regarding Soeharto," Head of the AGO's Sub-
directorate of Corruption Crime Antasari Azhar was quoted by the
newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Six investigators from the AGO on Monday questioned Soeharto
for one and a half hours at his house in Central Jakarta, but the
session had to be halted when his blood pressure went up.
</P>
<P>
The probe was done at his home after Soeharto twice failed to
appear when officially summoned by the AGO. His lawyers cited
health grounds on both previous occasions and argued that his
speech was impaired.
</P>
<P>
The investigating team said the 78-year-old Soeharto responded
well to most of the questions, and that they planned to quiz him
again once they receive a report from doctors present during the
session.
</P>
<P>
"We'll see whether the team would go to the suspect's residence
or ask him to appear at the Attorney General's Office. It's up to
the medical team's advice," Antasari added.
</P>
<P>
Separately, spokesman for the AGO Soehandoyo said his office
had not set a schedule to resume the questioning as of Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Attorney General Marzuki Darusman himself will announce the
date and the details of the resumption of the investigation," he
was quoted by the Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was named as a suspect in a case of alleged corruption
during his 32-year-rule after Marzuki Darusman decided to reopen
the case in December last year.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Unemployment Rate Likely to Remain High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's high rate of
unemployment, now officially at about 17 percent, will remain the
country's main problem until 2010, according to Manpower Minister
Bomer Pasaribu.
</P>
<P>
"We won't be able to overcome the unemployment problems for
another five to 10 years," Bomer was quoted by the Indonesian
Observer Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bomer said 36 million Indonesians are now out of work as a
result of the prolonged economic crisis, while the workforce has
increase by 3.5 million since the onset of the financial turmoil
in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
With this year's economic growth estimated at just between 3
percent and 4 percent, only 1.6 million jobs can be created, he
said.
</P>
<P>
To reduce unemployment, Bomer said, Indonesia should continue
to send workers, especially skilled ones, to other countries.
</P>
<P>
"We should open an international market for (Indonesian)
workers," he said.
</P>
<P>
About 400,000 Indonesian workers are sent abroad annually,
mainly to the Middle East and Asia Pacific countries. The number
of Indonesians working abroad on contracts currently stands at
about 2 million.
</P>
<P>
The government earns about 500 million U.S. dollars annually
from the remittances of overseas workers.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Asks Int'l Community to Solve E.Timor Refugee Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
asked the international community to solve the problem of tens of
thousands of East Timorese refugees now still staying in the
Indonesian province of East Nusa Tenggara (West Timor), Antara
news agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are calling on the international community to pay full
attention to the problem because it is a collective responsibility
of the international community," Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab said
before leaving for New York on Tuesday for a meeting with U.S.
Permanent Representative to the U.N. Richard Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
Alwi said that besides discussing aid for the East Timorese
refugees with Holbrooke, he would also inform him about what
Indonesia had done to overcome the problem.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government had made a proposal containing
details about relocation and employment plans which the
international community had orally agreed to, Alwi was quoted by
Antara as saying.
</P>
<P>
The mass exodus of East Timorese to East Nusa Tenggara occurred
due to the violence that followed the overwhelming vote for
independence from Indonesia during a U.N.-sponsored ballot in East
Timor on August 30 last year.
</P>
<P>
While more than 100,000 East Timorese have been repatriated in
recent months, hundreds of thousands of others remain in refugee
camps in the western half of the Timor island because they have no
home or job to return to.

<HEADLINE> Latin American, Caribbean Commission Stresses Poverty-fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, April 4 (Xinhua) - The 25th Session of the
Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC)
Tuesday highlighted the need to fight poverty in this region.
</P>
<P>
In a report entitled, "Equality, Development and Citizenship,"
the commission said that overcoming poverty constitutes an ethical
and political challenge, adding that social policies should make
more considerations for the poor.
</P>
<P>
The more appropriate programs are those of a comprehensive
nature and long duration, and programs centered on preventing
poverty from being passed on from generation to generation, said
the document.
</P>
<P>
Education and employment are two "master keys," and only when
people in this region achieve these basic fundamental supports,
can they meet this challenge, the document stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to ECLAC studies, at least 11 years of education are
required to make it possible for one not to fall into poverty.
</P>
<P>
ECLAC, a United Nations' commission founded in 1948 to co-
ordinate policies for the promotion of economic development in the
Latin American region, normally meets every two years in one of
the Latin American capitals.

<HEADLINE> Financial Sector: Shenzhen's Major Tax Source </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Rapid economic development has
turned the financial sector of the city of Shenzhen in south China
's Guangdong Province into a major source of tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released recently by the Shenzhen Local
Taxation Bureau, the financial sector turned in 13.8 billion yuan
in taxes from 1995 to 1999 at an annual growth rate of 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen is one of the two cities in China with a stock
exchange, and the development of the securities market has also
promoted the growth of banking and insurance services in the city.
</P>
<P>
The city is now home to 55 domestic financial organizations, 31
overseas-backed financial and insurance businesses, 203 securities
brokers, and 70 insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
There are about 200 overseas-backed financial organizations in
China, and these along with insurance companies are given a range
of preferential treatment, including tax holidays in their early
years of operations.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen is the first in the nation in profits generated from
the assets owned by overseas-backed financial and insurance
businesses. The assets of overseas-financed financial
organizations in Shenzhen account for 20 percent of the national
total, while their profits make up 40 percent of the country's
total.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Professor Develops Anti-Drought Agent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 5 (Xinhua) -- A special agent which can absorb
and store water 500 even 3,000 times the weight of a single seed
can help to battle the scourge of drought.
</P>
<P>
The agent, developed by Prof. Wang Shuyu of the Northeast
Agricultural University in this capital of Liaoning Province, can
be mixed with seeds before insemination. It will serve as a "mini-
reservoir" when the seeds germinate.
</P>
<P>
Years of testing have proved that the germination rate can be
raised to around 95 percent from 50 percent when this special
agent is used on farmland with only 10 percent of all the water
needed for plant growth.
</P>
<P>
Farmer Chang Fuyuan of Santaizi Village only spent one yuan (12
US cents) more per mu (one fifteenth of a hectare) when he planted
corn last year, and he harvested nearly 2,000 kg more of corn than
usual.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Wang believes that use of the agent can greatly reduce
the losses caused by drought, as 53.3 million ha of farmland in
China are of the dry farming type. Besides, China is facing a
growing problem of desertification.
</P>
<P>
The agent has been used in 62 arid counties in northeast and
north China since last year.

Shenyang, capital of northeast China's Liaoning province.
</P>
<P>
Workers will build 64 piers and two abutments to support the

tracked with a total length of 404.64 kilometers, and can
accommodate speeds up to 160 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
Listed as one of the country's key projects, the new line will
cost 15 billion yuan, which will be fully covered by the
government and completed and commissioned in August 2003.
</P>
<P>
The new railway will alleviate the serious congestion of
freight transport in northeast China, and will help double the
region's railway freight volume, said one expert with the Shenyang

<HEADLINE> Tax-free Deposit Offered for Education Expenses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China (PBOC)
has decided to allow financial institutions, except postal outlets,
to take tax-free deposits from citizens to be earmarked for their
children's education expenses.
</P>
<P>
The central bank entitled banks to give individual savings
accounts on preferential terms, and give yields on interest that
are excluded from a 20-percent tax levy imposed last November,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The move is expected to help people save money for their
children's non-compulsory education in senior high school and
college, and promote higher education in China, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China was previously the
only bank designated by PBOC to conduct the business last year,
and this was welcomed by Chinese complaining about much lower
interest rate and the tax levy.
</P>
<P>
Depositors, limited to fourth-graders in elementary school or
older, can open education savings accounts on one-year, three-year
or six-year terms by using real names.
</P>
<P>
The minimum amount for opening such an account is 50 yuan (6 U.
S. dollars) and the total amount must be under 20,000 yuan (2400 U.
S. dollars), the PBOC said.
</P>
<P>
Upon withdrawals of the deposits, the depositor must present
credentials provided by his or her school to get the 20 percent
tax exemption.

<HEADLINE> Pets Contribute to Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Pets may grow into a significant
aspect of the Chinese economy, as the small animals are boosting
domestic consumption by costing Beijing residents 500 million yuan
a year, according to the Beijing Association for the Protection of
Small Animals.
</P>
<P>
The association's statistics show that two-fifths of Beijing
households keep an average of 1.2 pets, which might be dogs,
cats, birds, fish or even insects. The city has 1.6 million of
such pets.
</P>
<P>
If people spend 300 yuan a year on one pet, the total cost in
Beijing for this hobby would be 500 million yuan, the association
calculated.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that, with an aging society and more people
becoming affluent, raising pets has become more and more popular.
Many supermarkets sell pet food and pet toys in addition to their
ordinary goods.
</P>
<P>
However, for health and safety reasons, some restrictive
regulations still pose an obstacle to the development of the pet
trade.

SAN JOSE, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso Tuesday defended the necessity for multilateral
control in fighting drug-trafficking, but opposed any form of
certification granted unilaterally by "a single country."
</P>
<P>
He is referring to the United States as a single country.
</P>
<P>
"We're in favor of multilateral cooperation. But we don't
believe any country can serve as a single judge in a matter of
such complexity," he said at a press conference after meeting
Costa Rican President Miguel Angel Rodriguez, referring to a
procedure applied annually by the United States to certify the
appropriate behavior for drug-fighting countries.
</P>
<P>
Brazil backed up the international penal tribunal being created,
he added, "But we don't think this matter can be changed for the
interest of just one country."
</P>
<P>
The demand of the United States has caused friction between
this country and states in Latin America, especially Mexico and
Colombia, where the question of drug-trafficking is particularly
sensitive.

<P>
ZHONGSHAN, April 5 (Xinhua) --A center for making film and
television programs is nearing completion in Cuiheng Village,
hometown of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, after more than 13 months of
intensive construction.
</P>
<P>
Sun Yat-Sen (Sun Zhongshan) was born in Xiangshan (now
Zhongshan), in south China's Guangdong Province, in November 1866.
He died of illness in March 1925. Sun led the revolution which
overthrew the Qing Dynasty, China's last feudal regime, in 1911.
</P>
<P>
The project is jointly funded by four organizations -- the
China Central Television Station, Zhongshan City Tourism Bureau
and China International Television Corporation -- at a cost of 10
million US dollars. The project is expected to be ready for
business by the middle of this month.
</P>
<P>
Covering an area of some 26.7 hectares, the center consists of
distinctive theme parks featuring exotic landscapes from such
countries as the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The center will form a large tourist attraction, along with
other historical structures, including the residence of Dr. Sun
Yat-Sen, old houses in Cuiheng Village and the Dr. Sun Yat-Sen
Memorial Middle School.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that the shooting of a 20-part TV drama featuring
the late leader of China's democratic revolution will start when

TIANJIN, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Daqiuzhuang, an industrial village-
turned-town outside this north China port city of Tianjin, paid
about 530 million yuan (some 64 million US dollars) in taxes to
the national treasury from 1993 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
That means that the 5,000 residents of Daqiuzhuang have paid
more than 10,000 yuan (about 1,205 US dollars) per person annually
over the past seven years, according to Tao Runli, Party secretary
of the village.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the village was turned into a town, and put under the
direct control of Jinghai County, Tianjin Municipality.
</P>
<P>
The economy has continued to boom in Daqiuzhuang ever since,
while its social stability has been maintained, Tao said in a
Xinhua interview.
</P>
<P>
Last year, it generated 1.2 billion yuan in gross product (GDP),
and the per capita net income reached 5,100 yuan.

<P>
All the local families have moved into new multi-story
apartments, with telephones, piped gas, and hot-and-cold running
water. Some have their own cars, Tao noted.

<HEADLINE> Iran Stresses Foreign Policy of Detente and Dialog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Majlis (parliament) Speaker
Nateq Nouri on Wednesday stressed the importance of detente and
dialog in developing relations with foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Iran is seriously following the policy of detente and
constructive dialogue with other countries to develop ties based on
mutual respect, non-intervention in others' internal affairs and
observation of international regulations, Nouri said.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg
Petersen, he said Iran is willing to improve ties with other
countries, especially Denmark and the European Union (EU), the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Nouri called for exchanges of political and parliamentary
delegations between Iran and Denmark to expand bilateral relations
and remove disputes.
</P>
<P>
However, he criticized the so-called selective and double-
standard behavior of EU states and certain international
organizations toward terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The EU members claim their opposition to terrorism but in
practice they have supported in various forms the terrorist group
Mujaheddin Khalq Organization (MKO) which has assumed
responsibility for its crimes such as mortar attacks on residential
units in Iran, Nouri said.
</P>
<P>
An opposition group based in Iraq, the MKO has long been engaged
in activities against the Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, the MKO launched a series of attacks on
Iranian interests inside and outside the country. In retaliation,
Iranian air forces also launched several cross-border raids on the
MKO bases near Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
In his talks with the Danish minister, Nouri also accused Israel
of aggression in south Lebanon and the Palestinian lands and
producing and keeping nuclear weapons. Such violations of human
rights should be dealt with seriously, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Petersen hailed the expansion of Iran-Denmark
political and economic relations.
</P>
<P>
He added that he believes firmly that Iran's relations with
Denmark and the EU will get stronger in the future, IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Peterson arrived here on Tuesday for a two-day visit, during
which he also held talks with his Iranian counterpart Kamal
Kharrazi and Iranian First Vice President Hassan Habibi on

<HEADLINE> Jordan Detains Italian Pilot for Violation of Airspace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian aviation authorities on
Wednesday forced a small Italian aircraft to land down at its Azraq
airport, 80 kilometers east of the capital city Amman and detained
its pilot for alleged violation of the Jordanian air space and
civil aviation laws.
</P>
<P>
The P68 plane, piloted by Italian Claudio Castonia and also
carrying four international activists lobbying for the lifting of
U.N. sanctions on Iraq, was believed to have entered the Jordanian
air space from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The plane was forced down at 0100 pm local time (0200 pm GMT)
Wednesday afternoon by Jordanian aviation officials, who said they
had not been notified by the pilot before his plane entered
Jordanian air space.
</P>
<P>
The small aircraft, which had shuttled between Amman and
Damascus for business missions before the incident, deviated its
routine line on Monday after taking off from Amman, and headed for
Iraq instead of its destination in Syria, Jordanian officials said.
</P>
<P>
The pilot and his passengers were apparently demonstrating their
defiance of an international ban on flights into Iraq, and they
were given a hero's welcome by Iraqi officials after the plane
touched down at an airport in Baghdad on Monday, reports from Iraq
said.
</P>
<P>
The pilot said he had flown his aircraft at a low altitude once
inside Iraq on Monday to avoid radar detection by U.S.-British air
forces, which were policing no-fly zones in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials are further investigating the motives of the
pilot and his passengers for the dramatic mission in and out of
Iraq, the first of its kind since U.S. and British forces imposed
no-fly zones in the south and north of Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Nicaraguan Declaration Worries Costa Rica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican authorities reacted
Wednesday with preoccupation before the threats by Nicaraguan
President Arnaldo Aleman of imposing an extraordinary tax on Costa
Rican imports.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to analyze these threats with attention," said
Vice Foreign Trade Minister Anabel Gonzalez. "This sort of actions
violate every Central American integration as well as other
international norms."
</P>
<P>
This would not be the first time Nicaragua's government would
adopt this kind of measures, since it has applied a 35 percent tax
on imports coming from Honduras, as a reprisal for this country's
border limits establishment adoption.
</P>
<P>
The Honduran Congress recently approved a law divining its
maritime border with Colombia in the Caribbean, which Nicaragua
considers as violating its interests.
</P>
<P>
Now Aleman is threatening to adopt a similar measure against
Costa Rica, in case the country decides to take the dispute on
navigation in the border river San Juan to an international court.
</P>
<P>
The two countries held talks last month in the presence of
Cesar Gaviria, secretary general of the Organization of American
States (OAS), in Managua and San Jose respectively, but did not
reach an agreement on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua, who is enforcing its sovereignty on the river,
opposes the navigation of Costa Rican armed police forces through
that waterway, something which national authorities claim is in
violation of the free navigation right which actual treaties
protect.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica had announced that, in case the bilateral dialogue
flunk, it would be necessary to access other mechanisms, such as
arbitration or international court.
</P>
<P>
Aleman said Tuesday that if Costa Rica decides to go to an
international tribunal, his country will have to raise taxes to
Costa Rican imports, in order to cover the expenses generated by
this process.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua is the second trade partner of Costa Rica in Central
America, after Guatemala. Last year, Costa Rican exports to
Nicaragua reached 177 million U.S. dollars, against 25 million U.S.
dollars in imports.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hopes for Close Relationship With Japan's New Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. officials said Wednesday
that Washington welcomed Yoshiro Mori to be elected the prime
minister of Japan and hoped to have close working relations with
him.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the Clinton
administration was pleased to see a smooth transition of power in
Japan as Mori was overwhelmingly approved by Japan's parliament to
replace the ailing Keizo Obuchi earlier Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I think that the administration at all levels is looking
forward to working closely with Prime Minister Mori during this
very difficult period," Lockhart told reporters.
</P>
<P>
When asked about a possible meeting between President Bill
Clinton and Mori, Lockhart declined a positive answer, saying that
he did not know whether they could have any "one-on-one session
like the president has had with some previous Japanese prime
ministers."
</P>
<P>
"But I do think that because of the importance of the
relationship, the president will have an opportunity to speak to
him soon and will have an opportunity to develop a relationship,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin, while "warmly"
welcoming Mori's election by Japan's parliament, said the United
States hoped for a close and cooperative relationship under the
newly-elected Japanese prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"We ... consider Prime Minister Mori to be a strong supporter
of the U.S.-Japan relationship, and look forward to continuing our
close and cooperative relationship with Japan under his leadership,
" he said.

According to the publication, the good results reached by the

countries, consisting in starting talks sticking to the list of
products known as "coincident", which make up the petition lists
in both countries, thus, enabling an agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian and Mexican lists, each, elaborated from the

Both countries' business sector, not participating directly in
the government negotiations, forecasts that there will be new

A custom preference agreement will also be signed before
president Zedillo's presidential term is over, that is, before
Mexican presidential elections due next July 2.

The official proposal is to negotiate the agreement until next

<HEADLINE> London Stock Market Shutdown For 8 Hours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- There was chaos in the City of
London Wednesday as unprecedented technical problems halted
trading on one of the London Stock Exchange's busiest days of the
year.
</P>
<P>
The LSE said it had been forced to shut down its information
system, or London Market Information Link, for three hours owing
to technical problems.
</P>
<P>
Investors were outraged by the fault -- the second this week --
which came just hours after violent price swings in U.S. stock
markets where leading indices lurched in ranges as big as 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
The breakdown also coincided with the last day of the tax year
when thousands of investors buy and sell stocks to minimize
capital gains tax liability.
</P>
<P>
City watchdog, the Financial Services Authority, announced an
investigation into the collapse which left millions of investors
unable to trade.
</P>
<P>
In a statement it said, "The FSA sees the failure of major
trading systems to open as a serious matter that requires a prompt
and thorough response."
</P>
<P>
It said it would work with the LSE to examine what changes and
back-up arrangements needed to be made to avoid a repeat of the
debacle.

LONDON, April 5 (Xinhua) - Europe's main stock markets closed
lower Wednesday as many technology, media and telecom shares lost
further ground, mirroring the slides on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 slid to a five week closing low, after a

was down 47.70 points, or 0.7 percent, at 6379.3.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Dax share index closed more than two percent lower
but bank shares helped reverse hefty early losses, buoyed by a
sudden collapse of a bank merger between Deutsche Bank and
Dresdner Bank.
</P>
<P>
Insurer Allianz, which would have bought Deutsche's asset
management business and taken a share in the combined personal
banking unit, dropped 13.9 percent.

The Dax index ended at 7330.77 points, down 192.03 or 2.55

</P>
<P>
EMBRAER's sources said that Solitair, which had acquired 30 ERJ

</P>
<P>
Orders to Solitair have totaled 90 so far, with a gross value
of 1.5 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
With the new orders, the regional airplanes ERJ-135 and ERJ-145
order book is in the order of 1,055 orders, out of which 612 are

<HEADLINE> DPRK FM Holds Talks with German Official in Berlin  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Foreign Minister of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea Paek Nam Sun arrived in
Berlin on Tuesday and had talks with the State Minister of German
Ministry for Foreign Affairs Ludger Volmer on Wednesday in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Paek Nam Sun was on his way to take part in a meeting of non-
aligned states in Cartagena in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Ludger Volmer expressed his "deep concern" over possible
development of weapons of mass destruction and the already
successful test of missile delivery systems of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
He called on Paek Nam Sun to open direct dialogue with its
southern neighboring country without any preconditions.
</P>
<P>
Volmer stressed that disarmament was the key to security on
the Korean peninsula and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
could contribute to the stability on the Korean peninsula through
its disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation and acceding to the
treaty for nuclear test ban.
</P>
<P>
Paek stressed also that now the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea is not going to develop the atomic weapons, but
possession of guided missile is a right of every state.
</P>
<P>
Paek's visit to Germany is the first high-level diplomatic
contact between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and
Germany since the 1980s. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea
kept the diplomatic relations with the former German Democratic
Republic in the past. After Germany's reunification in 1990 the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea had not established
diplomatic relations with reunified Germany.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea remained an agency
of rights and interests in Berlin after Germany's reunification.
The embassy of the People's Republic of China in Berlin is in
charge of rights and interests of the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea in Germany. The Swedish embassy in Pyongyang is in charge
of Germany's rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement of the German Ministry for Foreign
Affairs there is no any reason to refuse a talk on the level
because the European Union had resumed a dialogue with the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The Italian Foreign
Minister Lamberto Dini had visited Pyongyang on March 27.
</P>
<P>
"The German government currently has no intention of changing
the status of bilateral relations," said the statement of the
German Foreign Ministry. Germany will still provide with further
aids for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Last year
Germany had given the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 3.6
million marks (1.8 million dollars) worth humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
For the last time a official delegation with a member of the
Political Bureau of the Labour Party of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea had visited the former Federal Republic of
Germany at the beginning of 1980s. At that time the delegation was
received by the member of the presidium of the German Social
Democratic Party (SPD) Erhard Eppler and the politician for the
foreign policy of the German Liberal Democratic Party Juergen
Moellemann.

ATHENS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Greece Wednesday night urged
neighboring Albania to cooperate in combating the increasingly
organized crime.
</P>
<P>
Expressing Greece's concern over the inability of Albanian
authorities to curb organized crime and guard the marine and land
borders of their country, Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman
Panagiotis Beglitis hoped that Albanian authorities would
cooperate with their Greek counterparts to curb illegal activities
and put an end to incidents, such as those of the past days when
migrant traffickers attempted to land on the western Greek island
of Corfu.
</P>
<P>
Beglitis said that Greece respected the rules of international
law and international agreements which govern relations between
states, and it was also at the forefront of initiatives which are
aimed at cooperation, security, peaceful co-existence and economic
development of Balkan countries.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, a large quantity of illegal immigrants have
entered Greece with the aim of seeking a better life, and some of
them have been blamed by Greeks for the increasing crime in Greece.

ATHENS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- A total of nine forest fires broke
out in different parts of Greece over the past twenty-four hours.
</P>
<P>
The most serious of the forest fires broke out in four
different parts of the eastern Aegean island of Samos, and strong

In the Kydonia region of Hania prefecture on the southern

Other forest fires broke out in Drama, northern Greece and on

<HEADLINE> HK Chief Executive Sees "One Country, Two Systems" A Success Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of
China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), said here
Wednesday that "One Country, Two Systems" works well in Hong Kong
since China resumed the exercise of sovereignty over the region in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Tung, delivering his speech at a lunch at the New York-based
Waldorf Astoria Hotel, said, "Anybody who has been to Hong Kong
since the Handover can see that 'One Country, Two Systems' has
been transformed from a concept into an everyday reality."
</P>
<P>
"It is working well," he said. "We have been given maximum
support from our national leaders. At the same time, it has been
made clear time and again, that it is up to us in Hong Kong to
chart our own course -- Hong Kong people running Hong Kong with
high degree of autonomy as stipulated in the Basic Law."
</P>
<P>
Since the Handover, a lot has happened in Hong Kong, he said.
"We have had to face not one, but two distinct challenges as a
community. The first was political, and that was how to make a
success of the untested concept of 'One Country, Two Systems'. The
second was economic, and that was how for Hong Kong to achieve a
recovery from the longest recession in our history brought upon us
by the Asian financial crisis."
</P>
<P>
"That these two challenges were with us almost simultaneously
made our work much more difficult," he said. "Today, however, we
can take pride in the fact that with the support of the entire
community we have met these challenges head on and in the process
emerged with renewed strengths."
</P>
<P>
"'One Country, Two Systems' is working well in Hong Kong," he
said. "We are proud of what we have achieved in almost three years
since Reunification. But it would not have been possible, really,
without the support of Hong Kong people, the international
community and the unwavering determination of the (Chinese)
Central Government to make the 'One Country, Two Systems" a
reality."
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday afternoon, Zhang Hongxi, Chinese consular
general in New York, extended a warm welcome to Tung, saying that
he is the first HK Chief Executive to lead the Hong Kong people in
the practice of the "One Country, Two Systems'."
</P>
<P>
This is the second visit to New York by Tung since Hong Kong's
smooth hand-over in 1997. He is scheduled to visit Washington at
the end of the stay in New York.

<HEADLINE> Italian President to Visit Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Italian President Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi is scheduled to arrive in Sarajevo on Thursday in the midst
of tensions generated by Russia's anger over the capture of an
indicted Serb war criminal by French troops in NATO-led forces in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Russian Foreign Ministry said the arrest of
Momcilo Krajisnik, a former Bosnian Serb official, and transport
to the Hague for trial before the United Nations International
Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia marked "a clear violation
of legal regulations."
</P>
<P>
Ciampi said Wednesday that he wanted to see all countries
involved in the crisis-ridden Balkans to "examine their
consciences" as to why progress on Balkan problems is "lacking or
insufficient".
</P>
<P>
He also urged European Union to have the courage and
imagination to take responsibility for resolve regional crisis.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Ciampi will also go to the Tito Barracks in
Sarajevo to pay his respects to the more than 1,600 Italian troops
committed to the NATO-led peacekeeping operations in Bosnia.
