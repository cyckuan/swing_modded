   NEW YORK _ As Hurricane Georges continued on its destructive
path through the northeastern Caribbean on Tuesday, the storm also
roared to life for millions of people in New York City who have
relatives living in its path.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Martinez spent much of the day Tuesday darting from the
orange street-corner kiosk in the Washington Heights section of
Manhattan where he sells Spanish and English magazines, into a
nearby telephone center to try to reach his family in Santo
Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic. After six tries,
Martinez had his first stroke of luck around noon, when he reached
one of his brothers. But the news was not good.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all locked inside,'' said Martinez, 38, referring to
his parents, three children and 10 brothers who all live only a
quarter-mile from the sea. Martinez was also told that the walls of
some houses in his parents' neighborhood were being knocked down by
the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is fear of flooding and the wind,'' he said. ``It is
dangerous for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Martinez, people across New York were searching for news
and beginning to make plans to start relief efforts for relatives
in the islands.
</P>
<P>
   In Puerto Rico, the hurricane leveled buildings and left people
with little water and no electricity. The storm has left at least
20 people dead in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   The Dominican Republic was struck by winds of 120 miles per hour
barreling toward Santo Domingo, cutting power and forcing residents
into emergency shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Before Maria Diaz opened the doors to Mony Travel, a travel
agency in Washington Heights that advertises ``llamadas
internacionales'' (``international calls''), a line of anxious men
and women were waiting outside.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane reports brought such a brisk business to the narrow
storefront that Ms. Diaz, 33, had no to time to stop and call her
own family. She said her mother was on vacation in Santo Domingo,
where an older sister of Ms. Diaz lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nervous time,'' she said as she sat behind a counter,
distributing customers' keys to one of the eight telephone booths.
``Everyone wants to hear for themselves what is happening, but not
many calls are getting through.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Diaz tried to dismiss her fears for her family, but they
only intensified as customer after customer returned to the counter
with disappointment in their eyes and fear in their voices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid for my family and the country,'' she said. ``It's a
poor place. The houses are not so strong. They cannot survive
something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane unleashed similar fears among other New Yorkers
with ties to the Caribbean, as reports of the toll on Puerto Rico
and smaller islands like St. Kitts, Antigua and Nevis continued to
stream in.
</P>
<P>
   For two days, Sabu Rafael, 19, of Harlem has watched news
footage from Puerto Rico, hoping to catch a glimpse of his
73-year-old grandmother or to at least hear that her neighborhood
survived. ``I've tried to get through but I couldn't through,''
said Rafael, a pet-store manager.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael said he was as nervous about his grandmother as he was
about the damage to Puerto Rico. ``It really hurts to see what
happened. ''
</P>
<P>
   As officials began to calculate the damage, several relief
efforts were already under way in New York. Fernando Ferrer, the
Bronx borough president, and more than a dozen other elected
officials announced a combined relief effort for Puerto Rico and
other Caribbean islands.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to relieve the incredible suffering,'' Ferrer
said. ``Estimates of the damage are mind-boggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferrer asked for donations of water and electrical generators
but discouraged contributions of blankets and clothing. Fire
stations around the city will be used as informal drop-off points
for donations. And in the Bronx, seven hospitals have volunteered
to oversee the collections.
</P>
<P>
   The Caribbean American Chamber of Commerce and Industry, a group
of 1,500 business owners based in Brooklyn Heights, was soliciting
medical supplies, dried food items and money to finance relief
efforts in St. Kitts, where 130 mph winds ripped away the roof of a
major hospital and 70 percent of the homes, and to Antigua, where
at least two people were killed. The donations will be airlifted to
Antigua, which will serve as the distribution point.
</P>
<P>
   ``These islands are so vulnerable,'' said Roy Hastick, the
group's president. ``They depend on the tourism, and to have such a
deadly storm happen now at the beginning of the season is
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   After Hurricane Hugo in 1989, the group sent more than $50,000
to help with relief efforts in the Caribbean. But Hastick said this
hurricane would be more difficult to recover from.
</P>
<P>
   ``This storm has turned the Caribbean into one big disaster
site,'' he said. ``There is damage everywhere.''

PATAKI ON YANKEES: `THEY BELONG IN THE BRONX' 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gov. George Pataki made his most emphatic statement
so far in the fight over the future home of the Yankees, declaring
Tuesday that ``They belong in the Bronx, period.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's comments, made in an interview, could shield him
against attacks from his Democratic challenger _ Peter Vallone, the
City Council speaker _ who has garnered extensive publicity in New
York City by making himself chief advocate of the popular view that
the team should stay put.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's comments also appeared to move him closer than ever to
ruling out Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's proposal to build a new stadium
for the Yankees on Manhattan's West Side.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a great many factors that argue strongly against
that site,'' said the governor, who has ample power to stop such a
project. He cited traffic congestion in the Lincoln Tunnel and on
the West Side Highway, and the estimated $1 billion cost of
building a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone is trying, over Giuliani's objections, to put a
referendum on the stadium question on the November ballot, which
could help his candidacy by increasing turnout in the heavily
Democratic city. If the governor continues to signal opposition to
the project, he could make the referendum _ and Vallone's views _
moot.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's comments will not improve his tense relationship with
his fellow Republican, Giuliani. The two have clashed repeatedly
over West Side development issues, including expansion of the Jacob
K. Javits Convention Center and redevelopment of the New York
Coliseum site.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's press office did not return calls Tuesday seeking a
response to Pataki's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   When Giuliani first floated the idea of a new stadium in 1996,
some of Pataki's top advisers spoke favorably of it.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Vallone's campaign, Peter Ragone, called the
governor's latest remarks ``interesting'' in light of those earlier
comments from administration officials. ``Peter Vallone has been
consistent,'' Ragone said, ``saying all along he will keep the
Yankees in the Bronx unless the people say differently in a
referendum.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor has mostly kept silent in public as Giuliani and
Vallone battled over the team's future. The governor's strongest
previous statement was, ``I'd like to see them stay in the Bronx.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not excited about the idea of a Manhattan stadium, and
never have been,'' Pataki said Tuesday. But he stopped short of
saying flatly that he opposed the project, or that he would quash
it. When pressed, he repeated, ``They belong in the Bronx.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' principal owner, George Steinbrenner III, contends
that having the stadium in the Bronx discourages fans from
attending games, a drawback that would not be corrected by a major
renovation of the 75-year-old, city-owned structure. He has
threatened to take the Yankees to New Jersey after the team's lease
in the Bronx expires in 2002 if he does not get an agreement for a
stadium in Manhattan.,
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner has said he will make a decision on the team's
future after the election. His spokesman, Howard Rubenstein,
declined to comment Tuesday on the governor's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki could single-handedly prevent a Manhattan stadium through
his control of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which
owns the proposed West Side site, a rail yard west of Pennsylvania
Station. He could also block needed highway and tunnel
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   The governor favors renovation of the existing stadium, and said
that the state was prepared to take several steps to make it more
attractive, including a new Metro-North station, reconfiguration of
highways and help in expanding stadium parking.

TOO SOON FOR U.S.-IRAN DIALOGUE, IRANIAN LEADER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for light rewrite throughout)  (mk) 
 By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Mohammad Khatami of Iran said Tuesday that Iran has no
intention of opening an official political dialogue with the United
States until Washington takes concrete steps to change its attitude
toward his country.
</P>
<P>
   In a hastily arranged 90-minute breakfast and news conference
with a score of journalists, Khatami also made his first statement
as president on the fate of the novelist Salman Rushdie, who was
condemned to death by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. He suggested
that the time had come to bring the troublesome human rights issue
to a close.
</P>
<P>
   The news media's meeting with Khatami was described by his aides
as a way for him to get to know American journalists during his
first trip to the United States. Some of America's most prominent
journalists attended, including the anchors of the three major
networks, Peter Jennings of ABC News, Dan Rather of CBS News and
Tom Brokaw of NBC News.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because the news conference was expected to be broadcast
on Iranian television, the Iranian delegation struggled to
redecorate a conference room at the U.N. Plaza Hotel, laying down a
huge carpet borrowed from Iran's mission to the United Nations, and
planting a large Iranian flag beside the president.
</P>
<P>
   Women were not required to cover their heads, as they must do in
Iran, although no members of the all-male Iranian delegation shook
the women's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami, who spoke in Persian, made an effort to charm his
guests, smiling easily, showing flashes of humor and telling them
how he had started out as a journalist and editor. He spoke about
how he admired the American Puritans, summarized the definition of
justice in Plato's Republic and said he wished he could be a
tourist and spend up to a month in America.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his friendly manner, Khatami said his proposal for
cultural exchanges between Iran and the United States had been
misunderstood and did not include any government-to-government
talks, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Even visits to Iran by American legislators or mayors are not
under consideration, he said. ``Unfortunately there seems to be a
misinterpretation of what I've tried to say in this respect and
that is not to confuse a dialogue among people and cultures with
political dialogue,'' he said when asked what specific steps the
United States had to take to break the impasse. ``But it seems
there is a lot of confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Khatami welcomed what he called a ``change in speech'' by
American officials toward Iran. But he criticized the American
economic embargo against Iran and American opposition to the
construction of a pipeline to take oil from the Caspian Sea through
Iranian territory. He also faulted the United States for what he
called its failure to return the remaining assets belonging to
Iranians that were frozen by the U.S. government and for allocating
money to ``hurt the government of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is opposed to the creation of a Persian-language radio
station based in Prague to send broadcasts into Iran and in the
past has criticized the United States for starting a covert program
to destabilize Iran's government.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with CNN in January, Khatami announced the
launching of cultural exchanges as a way to break down what he
called the ``wall of mistrust'' between the two countries. But
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader, who wields more
power than the president, made clear within days that America was
still Iran's archenemy and that the initiative did not signal the
beginning of a warming of relations.
</P>
<P>
   In June, in a speech to the Asia Society, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright called on Iran to work with the United States to
draw up a ``road map'' for establishing relations between the two
countries. But she did not offer any specific incentive or policy
change to entice Iran to move.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Iran's foreign minister, Kamal Kharrazi, will deliver
a speech at the Asia Society that Iranian officials say will be
Iran's formal response to Albright's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Khatami also reiterated that, despite an
Iranian troop buildup and military maneuvers planned on the border
with Afghanistan, his country wants to avoid going to war to stop
the Taliban movement, which controls most of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iran is ready to defend its security and territorial
integrity,'' Khatami said. ``But we are making all efforts so that,
God willing, there will not be a war.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Khatami seemed annoyed only once during the news conference,
when asked why, if Iran is committed to the rule of law, it had
never revoked the death decree against Rushdie, who was accused of
blasphemy against Islam in his novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping and expecting that this question that has been
repeatedly asked over the years would not be mentioned or asked
today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The official position of the Iranian government is that the
decree by Ayatollah Khomeini, who was Iran's supreme religious
leader, cannot be revoked, but that Iran has no intention of
carrying it out.
</P>
<P>
   But Khatami went further, suggesting that Iran wants to put the
matter behind it and that Khomeini was expressing his own view as
an Islamic jurist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should consider the Salman Rushdie issue as completely
finished,'' Khatami said. He added that Khomeini ``as an Islamic
jurist gave us his opinion about this matter and many other
religious leaders have told us their opinions in this respect.'' He
added, ``The Iranian government has officially announced that in
practice it has made no decision to act on this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Khatami's words contrasted sharply with a 1993 statement by
Ayatollah Khamenei, successor to Khomeini. The statement said the
death sentence, or ``fatwa, is irreversible,'' adding: ``Rushdie
should be and will be executed. It is the duty for all Muslims who
have access to the mercenary to carry out the sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   According to some Islamic scholars, Khamenei has the authority
to revoke the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami was similarly relaxed and expansive in an
invitation-only reception on Sunday with about 800 Iranians living
in America, some of whom held positions under Shah Mohammed Riza
Pahlevi or fled Iran during the revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami said little about Islam but appealed to his audience's
sense of Iranian nationalism instead. He told the story of two of
the heroes in the 11th-century Persian epic poem, ``The
Shahnamah,'' adding that even in battle Iranians treated each other
with respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nationhood is not a piece of land,'' he said. ``It's in your
blood.''
</P>
<P>
   He urged those with special skills to return home to help
reconstruct the country. ``You can't expect a hero from outside to
come and change things,'' he said. ``You yourselves are the
heroes.''

CSUN KICK RETURNER STUNNED BY FLOJO NEWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Melvin Blue and Marcus Bivines were listening to
rap music and watching SportsCenter on Monday night when news of
Florence Griffith Joyner's death was given.
</P>
<P>
   Blue learned the news earlier in the day, but this was the first
Bivines heard of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He jumped up, turned the radio off and was like, `Whoa.' It
seemed like he knew her,'' said Blue, a Cal State Northridge
running back. ``I didn't get it at first. I was wondering why it
affected him so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Bivines, who didn't know Griffith Joyner, felt the jolt on a
more personal level. He returns kickoffs for the Matadors, but last
year he was an All-American in the 4x100-meter relay while at the
University of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a serious blow to the track community, and I'm not sure
most of the guys here really understood what she did,'' Bivines
said. ``She has a world record in the 100 and 200, but the time she
ran in the 100 (10.49 seconds), 99.999 percent of the men on this
planet cannot run. That's incredible. It's something utterly
awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it wasn't something Blue understood until he was
educated by Bivines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like, `Dude, if you had a race with her, she'd make you
look like a little kid,' '' Bivines said. ``After a while, he got
it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Abercrombie replacement: Linebacker Cos Ambercrombie, who
leads CSUN with 17 tackles, had surgery to wire his jaw shut
Tuesday at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Woodland Hills and
is feared out for the season. He broke it in the fourth quarter of
Saturday's win at Northern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Matadors coach Ron Ponciano, who planned on visiting Abercrombie
after the surgery, said a medical redshirt will be sought. Ponciano
said the jaw is broken in the same spot where a bullet is lodged,
the result of a shooting two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes sense because it's weaker there,'' Ponciano said. ``I
don't know, but I'm assuming he's (done for the season). He can't
eat a thing. He's just going to drink. And it's such a shame
because he's so well-liked, so well-respected. He's going to be
dearly missed.''
</P>
<P>
   A more pressing concern for the Matadors was finding a
replacement. Junior Quinton Reed and freshman walk-on Lewis Blanton
will battle for the starting job, though Blanton might have the
inside track.
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: A second X-ray showed receiver Eric Carpenter,
a Granada Hills High product, suffered a fracture in his right
ankle at Northern Arizona. But he said he expected to return Oct.
10 against Montana.... Center Beau Cherry continues to make
progress rehabbing his injured knee and said he's moved up his
targeted return date seven days to the Montana game.... The
ESPN/USA Today Division I-AA poll didn't rank CSUN but did have the
Matadors also receiving votes and listed as 30th. Northern Arizona
fell four places to No. 17.

EXPOS DEFEAT METS, 5-3 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Olerud tied a National League record by reaching
base safely in 15 consecutive plate appearances. Turk Wendell
established a New York Mets record for pitchers by appearing in his
eighth straight game.
</P>
<P>
   But what the Mets needed more than any individual accomplishment
_ a victory over a Montreal team that they should beat if they
really deserve to make the playoffs _ eluded them (again) before
32,467 fans at Shea Stadium on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets (88-70) squandered an early three-run lead and
eventually lost, 5-3, to the Expos on a bases-loaded single that
ricocheted off Dennis Cook's back and into right field to break a
3-3 tie.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets left two men on in the seventh and eighth innings and
one man on in the ninth. Todd Hundley, who might have been used as
a pinch-hitter, was not available because his wife, Tiffany, had
gone into labor with their fourth child.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have now lost 7 of 11 games this season to a Montreal
club that was 32 games under .500 when the day began. And so, the
Mets are once again tied with the Cubs in the race for the
wild-card spot with just four games left in the regular season.
Chicago beat Milwaukee by 5-2 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   New York's last two games are in Atlanta against two pitchers
named Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux. Just another reason why Tuesday
night's defeat hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets scored three runs in the bottom of the first inning.
The Expos answered with three of their own in the top of the third.
Then the game turned on a freakish hit in the top of the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   It came off Orlando Cabrera's bat, a one-hopper off Cook's back.
And when it kicked right and skipped over Carlos Baerga's head at
second with the bases loaded and two men out, two Montreal runs
scored and the Mets were down, 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets lighted into the Montreal right-hander Mike Thurman for
three runs and four hits in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud followed a one-out Edgardo Alfonzo single with a walk to
tie Barry Bonds' National League record by reaching base safely for
the 15th consecutive plate appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza then crushed a two-run double inside of third base.
One pitch later, Brian McRae hit a run-scoring double off the top
off the fence in left-center field. Derrick May later threw McRae
out at the plate on Carlos Baerga's two-out single to left, but the
Mets had given Armando Reynoso three runs to work with.
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso had pitched so well for the Mets after missing more than
a year because of arm troubles that Manager Bobby Valentine said
before the game, ``If there was a turning point to our season,
there were really two: Armando coming off the disabled list and Al
Leiter coming off the disabled list.''
</P>
<P>
   But where Leiter won his 17th game on Sunday afternoon to propel
the Mets back into the wild-card lead, Reynoso struggled on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso, 7-1 with a 2.77 earned run average since making his
first start, July 24, got out of the first inning when Tony
Phillips barehanded the carom of a Bob Henley shot off the
left-field fence and then threw the Montreal catcher out at second.
</P>
<P>
   But in the third, May homered off the base of the scoreboard in
right-center field to lead the inning off. Cabrera singled and was
sacrificed to second by Thurman.
</P>
<P>
   Wilton Guerrero followed with a run-scoring triple to right. And
then Terry Jones drove Guerrero home with the tying run on a
grounder to Olerud. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Olerud's streak finally ended when he grounded to second in his
second at-bat; that came with one out in the third.
</P>
<P>
   And so the Met first baseman fell one short of tying Ted
Williams' major league mark of reaching base in 16 straight plate
appearances, set in 1957. (Bonds had set the N.L. mark earlier this
season.)
</P>
<P>
   Olerud, who had been 9 for his last 9, also fell one hit short
of the N.L. record for consecutive hits.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud had not made an out since last Wednesday in Houston
against the Astros.

COLUMN: FOR AN `INVISIBLE' LIFE, NO EXCEPTION IN DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jose Soriano loved walking around the city. It was a
welcome stress-buster from his routine of working long shifts at a
Brooklyn clothing factory. Some days he sauntered through Central
Park to his railroad flat in El Barrio, taking in the sights of the
city he adopted eight years ago when he moved here from Mexico. His
wife, Fausta, worried about him, but he shrugged off her concerns.
There's always light, he reassured her. And people look out, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always said: `I would never leave New York. I love this
city,''' his wife recalled. ``He said he would only leave as a dead
man.''
</P>
<P>
   In the next few days, Soriano will return to Mexico just that
way. In a box. On Saturday night, as he was walking home through
Central Park, he was stabbed to death near Belvedere Castle. He was
47 years old and leaves behind the family that had joined him in
this country only four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As is the custom among the tightly knit extended families that
cushion the hard life of Mexican immigrants in New York, friends
and relatives bearing food and comfort have been trooping up the
dark, narrow staircase of the Sorianos' tenement home on East 106th
Street. The rooms are nearly barren, mostly just beds, dressers and
pictures of Our Lady of Guadalupe. The place is quiet, save for the
sound of murmured adult conversation or the squeals of babies being
carried by young women.
</P>
<P>
   The silence extends to the rest of the city, too. Unlike other
times when people have been beaten or killed in Central Park, there
has been little outrage over Soriano's death. Contrast that with
past attacks on the Jogger or the Piano Teacher, to name two
vicious crimes in the city's great green back yard that infuriated
the public and kept journalists busy for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Nor have there been visits from the mayor or condolence calls
from the police commissioner. Maybe the response would have been
better had early reports not inaccurately called Soriano homeless,
or if the Sorianos had been tourists or more upwardly mobile. But
they are the kind of people whose countrymen do the kind of drudge
work that keeps the local economy growing and humming for the
benefit of the leisure class.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, the reaction is as dead as Soriano. And the people
around him know it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is an obvious difference in how people are
treated and how crimes are treated for people who live below 96th
Street and people who live above 96th Street,'' said the Rev. Bruce
Lewandowski, the associate pastor of St. Cecilia's Roman Catholic
Church, the Sorianos' parish. ``You have somebody here who is a
so-called `invisible person,' an immigrant who is most likely
undocumented. They're invisible. They don't count.''
</P>
<P>
   So much so, that it took the authorities a day to realize that
Soriano was not homeless. That description might have been true a
few years ago, and only in the emotional sense, as he made the
transition from Mexico to New York. He had come to the city to save
some money and bring his wife and two sons up north, a goal that he
accomplished four years ago. His wife can still remember the exact
date, July 29, 1994. A Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had gone to Mexico and I told him I did not want to stay
alone anymore,'' she said in Spanish. ``For good or bad, I came
with him. I didn't want to be separated anymore. I wanted to be by
his side.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough, they even worked together in a factory that made
maternity clothing. It helped ease her transition to a new country,
although she stopped working nearly three years ago when their
daughter Grizelle was born. Mrs. Soriano's health was not good, so
he told her to stay home while he put in six days a week at the
Brooklyn factory for a few hundred dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was paid by the piece,'' she said. ``So when he could, he
would want to continue working. He was one of those people who did
not want to be at home. He would leave at 6 in the morning and come
home at 10.''
</P>
<P>
   As difficult as such an existence was, the Sorianos found pride
in being able to provide for their three children. They knew no
other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always said it was hard here, but it was harder in
Mexico,'' Mrs. Soriano said. ``I never asked the government for
help. We live to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday he left work and went to a store to buy a pair of
baseball cleats for a friend who played with him on a team in Red
Hook. For the first time in their life together in New York, he
never came home. Mrs. Soriano kept an all-night vigil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat,'' she said. ``I stood. I looked out the window for him.
But no.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, she said detectives spoke to her husband's
teammates in Brooklyn, and that's when word of his fate finally
reached her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he wanted to come home walking through the park,''
Mrs. Soriano said. ``And he found death along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Police took her to the precinct station house, she said, then
let her go after a while, promising to let her know when they had
something to report. She said she has not heard anything since
police arrested a suspect, only to drop the charges later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the mayor talking about the crime on the news,'' she
said. ``But nobody called from his office. Is it because we are
Hispanic? Do they think we come here to take something from them?
We only come to work. Or is it because we're poor?''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Soriano does not have enough money to send his body back to
Mexico. Friends and relatives are taking up a collection, but they
are just as strapped as she. Yet they offer lessons in compassion.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something like this happens, we talk to each other and
try to help with what we can,'' she said. ``Maybe they cannot help
with money, but they can help with moral support.''
</P>
<P>
   She will help, too, by returning to work in the coming weeks.
Her husband's bosses said she was welcome to her old job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to push my children ahead,'' she said. ``My husband is
gone. He has to rest. The dead go to rest. The living are here to
struggle to keep living.''
</P>
<P>
   She walked over to the window where she stood on Saturday night.
In her hand was a picture of her husband, natty in a baseball
uniform that had ``Braves'' emblazoned on the jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mira,'' their daughter, Grizelle said, as she tugged at the
picture. ``Papi. Papi.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the streets were grey and damp. A few doors away from
the Sorianos' building, a wall was decorated with a mural of St.
Sebastian tied to a pillar, his nearly naked body pierced by
arrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We walk among each other in a deep dream,'' read an
inscription, ``committing small acts of violence among one another.
The heart that awakens first will take us to the heavens from this
earth.''

CUBS BEAT BREWERS, 5-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BILL DEDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Sammy Sosa conceded the home run race on Tuesday,
saying Mark McGwire ``will finish a little bit higher.'' But the
Chicago Cubs have not conceded the race that Sosa says really
matters.
</P>
<P>
   With a little help from a former New York Met, the Cubs defeated
the Milwaukee Brewers, 5-2, on Tuesday night and pulled even with
the Mets in the National League wild-card race. Each team has four
games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa and McGwire each went 0 for 4 with two strikeouts on
Tuesday night, McGwire doing so in a 4-0 Cardinal victory over
Houston in St. Louis. Sosa failed to manage a hit for his fifth
straight game, spanning 21 straight fruitless at-bats. He is
stalled at 63 home runs, 2 behind McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Pulsipher, the Brewers' starter on Tuesday night, did the
Mets no more good than when he pitched for them. Pulsipher, who was
traded from New York to Milwaukee in July, gave up five runs before
the fourth inning was done. Worse, he gave away two of the runs,
failing to cover home plate on one play, and covering first base
too late on another. His record fell to 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   The one batter Pulsipher and the Brewers shut down consistently
was Sosa, who continued the overswinging that started over the
weekend in the Cubs' final home games. Sosa acknowledged that he
had tried too hard when his mother and sisters visited in Chicago
and the Cubs held ``Sammy Sosa Day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time they throw my pitch right there, I'm just
missing,'' Sosa said after the game. ``All year I haven't been
missing them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he felt rested after a day off Monday and was confident
that he could lead the Cubs to the playoffs. ``I think I'll finish
real strong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's crowd at County Stadium was as friendly to the
Cubs as one confined in Wrigley Field. The Cubs were playing 90
miles north of home, but Milwaukee seemed to have more fans in Cubs
blue than in Brewer green. The attendance of 52,287 was just short
of the 54,000 average attendance here for McGwire over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   When the Mets-Expos final score was posted during the ninth
inning here, Cubs fans stood and cheered. When Mark Grace was then
hit by a pitch, giving Sosa one more at-bat, the fans cheered. When
Sosa was called out on strikes, they booed the umpire.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs did not mince words about their situation in the
wild-card race as they ended a three-game losing streak on Tuesday
night. They will play Wednesday in Milwaukee, then their last three
in Houston, while the Mets play one more at home against the Expos,
then three in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't lose another game,'' said Jeff Pentland, the Cubs'
hitting coach. ``We just need to take the S's off our chests and
not try to do too much.''
</P>
<P>
   For a game they couldn't afford to lose, the Cubs were without
Kerry Wood, their rookie pitching sensation, who has a sprained
elbow. So they relied on a starting pitcher they haven't allowed to
start: Terry Mulholland, the veteran left-hander, whose contract is
heavy with incentives for successful starts, a pitcher who had been
relegated to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Mulholland (6-5) responded with eight strong innings, giving up
only one run in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Beck gave up a home run in the ninth to Jeromy Burnitz, but
struck out the last batter, Bob Hamelin, with runners on second and
third. Lance Johnson, another former Met, hit a home run for the
Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa gave the fans a fright when he crashed into catcher Bobby
Hughes while sliding home with the first run of the game. It
appeared that Sosa's groin hit Hughes's knee. Sosa lay on the
ground for two minutes. He walked gingerly into the dugout and
stayed in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers have been reliable victims, but not even-handed
victims, in the home run race, giving up four home runs to McGwire
and 10 to Sosa.  &QL;

CLOSE CALLS AT SKY HARBOR RENEW CALL FOR WARNING LIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY JO PITZL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three near-collisions in the past month at Sky Harbor
International Airport have re-ignited a call for warning lights
designed to keep waiting planes off runways.
</P>
<P>
   The latest incident occurred about 7 a.m. Tuesday. A Continental
Airlines Boeing 737 headed for Cleveland taxied dangerously close
to the airport's south runway while a cargo carrier raced toward
takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   The cargo plane, a Boeing 727, cleared the runway _ and the
Boeing 737. It was unknown how many people were on the cargo flight
or the Continental flight, but a 737 can carry 141 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Air-traffic controllers had feared the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were within 10 feet of a disaster,'' said David Stock, a
union representative of the National Air Traffic Controllers
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Airport and Federal Aviation Administration officials say there
was more room than that. But the close call renewed the FAA's
request for the warning lights, said Martin Hardy, air-traffic
manager for the Phoenix control tower.
</P>
<P>
   Sky Harbor officials said Tuesday that they haven't received
such a request. They're waiting for an FAA investigation report
before determining whether lights would have prevented the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   They said factors other than an absence of warning lights could
have been involved. For example, the Continental pilot not only
passed up signs, but also crossed over a painted bar that shows
where planes are to line up, airport officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like it's a barren area devoid of signs,'' said
Stephen Bigg, Phoenix deputy aviation director for operations.
</P>
<P>
   Continental officials were not available for comment Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy said his office has filed a complaint against the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   And although Hardy said it is difficult now to say why the pilot
continued rolling toward the runway, he wonders whether flashing
lights would have stopped him sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a visual aid to the pilot that there's something there,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lights, like flashing railroad crossing lights, blink day
and night.
</P>
<P>
   Airport officials said they already plan to install two sets of
the blinking lights. One set will go on the airport's north runway,
and one on the south, Bigg said.
</P>
<P>
   The lights were suggested by an FAA certification officer after
a routine inspection, he said. They will be the first such lights
installed at Sky Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's incident was the third time in a month that planes
have moved too close to the south runway from connecting taxiways,
the FAA said. In each case, the FAA filed a complaint against the
offending pilot.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 16, a King Air plane taxied onto the south runway at
the same time a Boeing 727 was preparing to depart. The air-traffic
controller made the 727 wait and had to send an incoming plane on a
loop around the Valley to let the errant King Air plane take off,
Stock said.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 28, a Mesa Airlines plane taxied onto the runway while a
Cessna 208 was taking off.
</P>
<P>
   In all cases, no one was hurt and no equipment was damaged. &QL;

AD CAMPAIGN, MAYOR START SPREADING THE NEWS ABOUT L.A. IN N.Y.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Daily News Staff Writer Fred Shuster contributed to this story) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mayor Richard Riordan's visit to New York City had
all the makings of a bruising, knock-down fight with his longtime
rival, Mayor Rudy Giuliani, over whose city is better.
</P>
<P>
   As Riordan toured New York on Tuesday to tout what he calls the
``New L.A.,'' Los Angeles boosters launched a $100,000 ad campaign
in New York that claims the Big Apple should be ``turning green
with envy'' over the City of Angels' success.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Giuliani had quipped that ``New York could
kick any other city's ass.''
</P>
<P>
   So on a TV talk show in New York, Riordan met Giuliani's boast
with an equally sharp rejoinder:
</P>
<P>
   ``To kick somebody's ass,'' the mayor said, ``you have to be
behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Riordan, a native New Yorker, came face to face with
Giuliani during a news conference Tuesday, he found himself issuing
an apology to the former federal prosecutor _ and even admitting
that he is somewhat embarrassed by the ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kidding him about it,'' Riordan recalled in a telephone
interview. ``I said to Rudy that I apologized for the ad and said
now that I'm back here, the Big Apple is redder and shinier than
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   It was all part of the long-running feud over who is America's
No. 1 mayor and which is America's No. 1 city, much as Angelenos
and New Yorkers have vied for years.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan has not been shy about questioning how anyone could live
on the East Coast and boasted of Los Angeles' environment, climate,
beaches and universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is kind of an ongoing fun little tug-of-war with New York
to draw attention to the fact of our diversity,'' said Tracy
Williams, a spokeswoman for the New Los Angeles Marketing
Partnership, which ran the newspaper ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to do a little bragging,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   NewLAMP timed its ad campaign to coincide with Riordan's visit
to New York City to basically declare Los Angeles as the tops with
an ad showing a red apple turning green and a headline, ``Uh-oh,
New York's just seen the latest statistics on L.A.'s economy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This tells everybody how well Los Angeles is doing,'' NewLAMP
Executive Director Regina Birdsell said. ``We thought this would be
a fun way to tell them, by using the icon of the Big Apple turning
green.
</P>
<P>
   ``And while we're running these ads, we have our businessman
mayor in New York to be a spokesman for our economy. This puts his
fingerprints on what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   As outlined in the ad, among Los Angeles' claims is that it is
No. &UR;  &LR; 1 in the creation of new jobs and new businesses; No. &UR;  &LR; 1 in
manufacturing, apparel industry, software, multimedia and the
television-film industry; and No. &UR;  &LR; 1 in international trade and
affordability.
</P>
<P>
   Not mentioned but nonetheless a sore spot, Los Angeles has won
back the MTV Video Music Awards after four years at New York's
Radio City Music Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't after any of their businesses,'' Birdsell said.
``We're after their money. We want investors to begin looking at
our entrepreneurs and invest in them. We want to make sure they
know what's happening out here and the future businesses of the
next century.''
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers, in contrast, boast of their cultural landmarks;
corporate, financial and media headquarters; museums; Broadway; the
success of the Yankees and Mets; and the fact it has two
professional football teams _ even though both play in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the posturing and boasting, Riordan said the main point
of his meeting with Giuliani was to discuss common efforts in
fighting crime.
</P>
<P>
   It was during a 1995 visit that Riordan learned of New York's
crime tracking program, which has since taken root in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   On this trip, Riordan said he learned of an anti-narcotics
program he wants studied while Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C.
Parks offered advice on some his programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we adopted their Comstat program, our technology is much
better,'' Riordan said. ``We want to make that available to them.
Also, we told him of our neighborhood code watch program, curfew
violations and the CLEAR (Community Law Enforcement and Recovery)
anti-gang program.''

HACKETT FEELING OPTIMISTIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Call him crazy. Call him an unbridled optimist.
</P>
<P>
   But USC coach Paul Hackett believes that Florida State's 35-game
home unbeaten streak might actually work in the Trojans' favor. And
he's well aware that the Seminoles last lost at Doak Campbell
Stadium in 1991, the famous 17-16 ``Wide Right'' loss to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to believe at some point point the percentages have
to favor the other team,'' Hackett said. ``Since 1991, at some
point, you have to feel like you have an advantage going there. I
may not say that when the game is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great test for us and great time for us to be going on
the road. We're going to have to win on the road to have the kind
of season we want to have.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Still two quarterbacks: Hackett said he is not altering his
system of playing both Mike Van Raaphorst and Carson Palmer, even
though Florida State is expected to put more pressure on the
quarterback than any team USC has faced. The Seminoles actually
knocked nine quarterbacks out of games last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Carson can handle it as well as Mike can,'' Hackett
said. ``I think he's just got to keep playing and developing.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Harris in doubt: Tight end Antoine Harris reaggravated his
already sprained ankle and was carted off the practice field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's uncertain for the game,'' Hackett said. ``Same ankle.
Same problem. Same issue. I think it's an ongoing thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Lonnie Ford is scheduled to start his second straight
game at tight end. Center Matt McShane is supposed to return to
practice today, although Hackett said he will not play this week.
</P>
<P>
   __ Bring on the noise: USC installed loudspeakers on the
practice field blaring crowd noise in hopes of emulating the
atmosphere in Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing I want is to make them conscious of it,''
Hackett said. ``I don't want there to be any surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Who was that man?: There was quite a mystery about who
deserved a roughing-the-passer penalty called against USC in the
Oregon State game. Game films finally revealed defensive end Kori
Dickerson as the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   __ Bad food: Florida State has been hit by a severe case of food
poisoning, according to coach Bobby Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duke said that they had food poisoning for our game, and now
we have the same thing,'' Bowden said. ``Half of our team is sick.
We didn't practice much (Tuesday). I hope we'll be back (today).''
</P>
<P>
   __ Weather forecast: Saturday's weather in Tallahassee is
expected to be 86 degrees with humidity approaching 90 percent.

YANKEES SWEEP DOUBLEHEADER FROM INDIANS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout)   (sw)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even when they are on the verge of tying the American
League record for victories, the Yankees still manage to muster a
bit of intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   Remember how Hideki Irabu appeared to have no chance of being on
the playoff roster? Well, Manager Joe Torre now says that Irabu
(13-9) is all but assured of a spot, after beating Cleveland, 5-1,
in the second game of the Yankees' day-night doubleheader sweep at
Yankee Stadium. And Graeme Lloyd, a solid contributor in the
bullpen for five months? He may be off the team, if he can't edge
out Darren Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Shane Spencer, a little-known minor league
journeyman a month ago. Now, with a burst of power _ he slugged two
homers in the first game of the doubleheader, a 10-4 Yankees
victory _ he may get a chance to play a meaningful role in the
playoffs, while Chad Curtis' stock continues to plummet. As the
Yankees' world turns.
</P>
<P>
   With five games remaining, the Yankees (109-48) need one victory
to match the single-season club record of 110, set by the 1927
Yankees (who finished 110-44), and two victories to tie the
American League record of 111, set by the 1954 Indians.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, the Yankees matched the highest victory total
since baseball expanded to a 162-game schedule in 1961, the 109 won
by the 1961 Yankees and the 1969 Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Torre and his staff met for an hour on Tuesday, between games of
the doubleheader, and should finalize their post-season pitching
rotation in the next 48 hours. But after Irabu allowed one unearned
run in eight innings _ he has not given up an earned run in his
last 16 innings _ Torre said he anticipated that all five of the
Yankees' starters would be on the 10-man playoff pitching staff:
David Wells, David Cone, Orlando Hernandez, Andy Pettitte and
Irabu, with Irabu probably pitching out of the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that Irabu truly impressed Torre and his coaching
staff in his last two starts. It could be that a certain principal
owner cast a tie-breaking vote to keep Irabu; George Steinbrenner
was in the house on Tuesday. No matter, Irabu is expected to
participate in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to keep my self-confidence at the level it's at
right now,'' he said through his interpreter, George Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Add the closer Mariano Rivera, the left-hander Mike Stanton and
the right-handers Ramiro Mendoza and Jeff Nelson, and that leaves
one spot available for Holmes or Lloyd. A month ago, Lloyd would
have been an easy pick for Torre. But Holmes has pitched well of
late, and Lloyd has had trouble getting left-handers out, in spite
of his cumulative 1.78 earned run average. ``There are going to be
a lot of tough decisions to make,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring Lloyd will be extremely difficult, because if the
Yankees play Texas, they will have only one left-hander in their
bullpen to cope with the left-handed hitters Rusty Greer and Will
Clark. Two years ago, Lloyd rebounded to throw well in the
post-season. On the other hand, Holmes' stuff _ his curveball and
fastball _ has been as good as that of any other Yankees pitcher
since he came off the disabled list this month.
</P>
<P>
   Said Torre, ``You try to ride a hot hand when you get in the
post-season.''
</P>
<P>
   Taken literally, that would mean that Spencer, 26, is quickly
becoming a factor in Torre's mind, though Spencer has only 49 major
league at-bats. ``He's opened our eyes,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer's emergence has come just as Darryl Strawberry and Tim
Raines are hobbled by minor leg injuries _ Strawberry bruised his
calf when he was hit by a pitch Monday, and Raines has a sore knee.
Neither injury is considered serious, but both players are older
and have histories of leg trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis, who played well in the first half of the season and was
rewarded with a three-year contract, has had a miserable second
half, batting just .208 in 192 at-bats with 1 home run and 13 runs
batted in, including a .182 average with runners in scoring
position. Pitches on the outer half of the plate have been a
mystery to him, and his defensive play has suffered of late.
</P>
<P>
   Going into September, the Yankees' post-season lineup figured to
include Raines or Strawberry against right-handed pitchers, and
Raines or Curtis against left-handers. But Spencer is crushing the
ball and Curtis is floundering and Torre is watching. ``The way
he's swinging the bat now,'' Torre said of Spencer, ``nobody is
swinging the bat better.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing the Indians' Dave Burba in the first game of the
doubleheader, Spencer slammed a gigantic 410-foot solo home run in
the second inning, the second of three home runs the Yankees hit in
the inning. (Tino Martinez hammered a two-run homer, and Scott
Brosius homered immediately after Spencer.) Two innings later,
Spencer drove his second home run of the game to straightaway
center field. He came close to hitting home runs in the sixth
inning, driving a ball to the wall, and in the seventh, hitting a
towering shot 15 feet foul.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer also made a running, leaping catch in the second inning
and nearly threw out a runner at second base in the sixth inning,
further confirmation of Torre's belief that Spencer can be at least
adequate in playing the outfield. In the second game, Spencer had
two singles, a walk and an rbi He has a .388 average and an .857
slugging percentage. Assigned to Class AAA Columbus most of the
season, Spencer waits to see what Torre has in store for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no control over that,'' Spencer said. ``If I get a
chance to play, I'm just having fun.'' &QL;

D'AMATO SEEKS TO EXPLOIT UPSTATE RESENTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an unusually blunt appeal to upstate antagonism
toward New York City, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato began broadcasting a
television advertisement Tuesday asserting that his Democratic
challenger, Rep. Charles Schumer of Brooklyn, had written off
upstate New York with statements and votes throughout his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liberal Brooklyn congressman Chuck Schumer doesn't think
upstate New York matters,'' the announcer says over the bouncy
sounds of lounge music, while the screen depicts a jagged saw
cutting off the rest of New York state and leaving only downstate
behind. The advertisement will air only north of New York City,
D'Amato's aides said.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement reinforces the principal message spread by
D'Amato, a Republican seeking a fourth term in Washington, during a
two-day trip upstate on Sunday and Monday: that Schumer was hostile
to the concerns of people who live north of New York City. To make
the point, the advertisement pointed to statements and votes cast
by Schumer, going back to 1977, on bills from cutting dairy price
supports to raising gas taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Election Day, send Chuck Schumer a message: There's more to
New York state than just Brooklyn,'' the announcer says.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's advisers attacked the advertisement as polarizing and
politically out of bounds. ``It is a desperate and misleading
attempt at division from a candidate who is behind in the polls,''
said Howard Wolfson, Schumer's spokesman. ``Chuck Schumer is a
tax-cutting, crime-fighting Democrat and Al D'Amato just doesn't
know how to react to that.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's decision to air the stark advertisement _ and risk
both alienating supporters in New York City and courting criticism
that he is seeking to divide voters _ clearly signals the political
weight he is attaching to upstate in this difficult re-election
campaign. D'Amato's advisers, explaining the reasons behind the
pointed attack, said that based on past elections, they expected 45
percent of the vote to come from upstate, compared with 30 percent
from New York City and 25 percent from the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Gov. George Pataki also banked on upstate support to
defeat Mario Cuomo, but avoided direct appeals to rivalries between
the two parts of the state. In this campaign, Pataki, who is by all
accounts in a strong position as he seeks a second term this year,
has made a particularly vigorous appeal for support from downstate
voters _ an appeal that Democrats said Tuesday might be complicated
by the emerging tactic of his fellow Republican.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Pataki and D'Amato are offering different political
responses to what they each perceive as the same problem: that
Republicans will be hurt this year by the struggling upstate
economy. D'Amato is trying to push up his vote upstate, where he
has historically been strong, while Pataki, who is looking for a
large re-election victory to enhance his credentials as a national
candidate, is looking to New York City for support.
</P>
<P>
   In making the advertisement, D'Amato's advisers combed through
Schumer's record in Congress and the state Assembly, seeking votes
that served the interests of Schumer's constituents in Brooklyn but
might not sit well with voters elsewhere in the state. For example,
Schumer voted for two bills to curb payments to dairy farmers, to
the benefit of milk drinkers. He also voted three times to increase
the gas tax, another position that was not likely to offend the
sentiment in his urban district.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's advisers called the attack a fair case based on
Schumer's record. ``These are his quotes and his votes,'' said
Kieran Mahoney, a senior political adviser to D'Amato. ``And I
think if anybody had some concerns about this, it would be the 40
percent of New Yorkers who live west of the Hudson River and north
of the Tappan Zee Bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Schumer's aides disputed one central element of
D'Amato's advertisement _ its quotation of Schumer as saying, ``To
me, the West begins across the Hudson River.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson said the comment was taken out of context. And a
transcript of the April 1997 press conference where Schumer made it
suggests he was making a joke. Schumer mistakenly identified Rep.
Richard Durbin as being from Idaho. He is from Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``To you, I am from a Western state,'' Durbin said, according to
Federal News Service, which transcribes news conferences in
Washington. The transcript describes Schumer as laughing, and then
saying: ``That's right. To me, the West begins across the Hudson
River. In any case, we are glad to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney defended the use of the quotation. ``He said it,''
Mahoney said.

FOR RUSSIAN NEW YORK, A `SUBURB' NEXT DOOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Viktor Angurov lives on a leafy street in the
affluent Brooklyn neighborhood of Manhattan Beach, about one mile
from his mother's apartment in Brighton Beach. It is the same
one-bedroom apartment they shared after arriving from Moscow in
1979 with two suitcases and $90.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the short distance seemed so far: Brighton Beach was the
Russian ghetto, Brooklyn's Little Odessa, teeming with new
immigrants from the Soviet Union, many of them all but penniless.
Manhattan Beach was a quiet, mostly Jewish enclave of old money and
oceanfront houses. To immigrants like Angurov, looking up from the
bottom of the ladder, Manhattan Beach represented the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manhattan Beach, in some ways, was a dream destination for
us,'' Angurov said. ``It was the best of everything in a way.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, nearly two decades later, as a steady tide of immigrants
from the former Soviet Union has reshaped much of southern
Brooklyn, affluent Manhattan Beach is fast becoming the Scarsdale
of Russian New York. Up and down its shady streets, Manhattan Beach
is rife with construction sites as size 12 houses rise on size 6
lots, many of them with a BMW or a Volvo parked behind a gated
driveway. It is not difficult to pick out the renovated or rebuilt
Russian houses; one non-Russian resident classified the
architectural style as ``the fortress look.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, these Russian arrivistes have spawned tensions
in both Manhattan Beach and Brighton Beach. In Manhattan Beach,
many older residents complain that Russian taste is, well,
tasteless. They worry that the character of the neighborhood is
endangered. In Brighton Beach, still a hub of Russian groceries,
restaurants and nightclubs, a few civic leaders complain that they
are being abandoned. They want the most affluent Russians to revive
Brighton Beach's own deteriorating housing stock.
</P>
<P>
   But for many Russian immigrants, the boundary between the two
communities is increasingly irrelevant; in what could be called
Russian New York, Brighton Beach is the equivalent of ``the city,''
a place to work or eat or drink.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Brighton Beach's cultural insularity gave security to its
struggling residents. Now, assimilation is not such a dirty word
for many younger, more prosperous Russians. Angurov, now 45, who
owns a business that sells and repairs electronic pagers, sees
Manhattan Beach as a compromise. He can almost walk to meet his
mother, who prefers the familiarity of Brighton Beach, for lunch.
``It's close, but it's not the same,'' he said. ``It's
suburban-type living.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russianization of Manhattan Beach is but the latest phase in
the creation of a Russian city within a city in the 1990s. Between
1991 and 1996, Russians were Brooklyn's fastest-growing immigrant
group. During the same period, the Immigration and Naturalization
Service admitted more than 339,000 immigrants to the United States
from the former Soviet Union, many of whom settled in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Amid this flow of immigrants, many Russians who had already
prospered in Brooklyn began shopping for their dream house. Some
moved to Staten Island or New Jersey. Others bought old homes in
Manhattan Beach. One of the neighborhood's leading real estate
agents, Jon Sobel, said prices now range from $400,000 to $1.2
million. In the last two years, Sobel said, nearly two out of every
three buyers have been Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Their arrival has not gone unnoticed by longtime residents. ``A
lot of people say, `Look what they have put up,''' said Dana
Borell, president of the Manhattan Beach Community Group, who says
she has tried to remain open-minded. ``Aside from the fact that
it's very massive, it's not so awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, though, dull public hearings on proposed zoning
variances became heated battles. Established residents lobbied to
block expansions and renovations. ``I think Manhattan Beach is a
unique place,'' said Ruth Freets, speaking unsuccessfully against
an expansion proposal at a public hearing last week, ``and if we
build up, out, back and front, it's going to look like a lot of
other places in Brooklyn _ cluttered.''
</P>
<P>
   Some new Russian buyers have simply torn down the existing homes
and started over. Huge columned, brick structures seem to be a
popular style. Even Angurov, laughing gently, concedes that Russian
style can be somewhat flamboyant. ``Over there in the Soviet times,
everything was drab and colorless,'' he said. ``The new styles
would come around five years after it left here.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Not everyone is opposed to the Russian look, though. Sobel said
that the new construction has increased property values in the
neighborhood. He said many of the homes were outdated or suffered
from benign disrepair.
</P>
<P>
   For Pat Singer, longtime president of the Brighton Neighborhood
Association, the Manhattan Beach building boom is bittersweet. In
Brighton Beach, the rent-controlled apartments in the six-story
apartment buildings between Brighton Beach Avenue and the boardwalk
are filled to capacity, mostly with Russian retirees. Yet the rows
of houses north of Brighton Beach Avenue, many of them carved into
small apartments, attract a more transient, less stable population,
Ms. Singer said.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, Ms. Singer has lobbied for a new
waterfront development on the site of the old Brighton Beach Baths.
After several failed proposals, developers are now presenting plans
for a mixed-use development with up to 850 residential units.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the curse of Brighton Beach,'' she said, pointing to a
row of deteriorating houses on a side street above Brighton Beach
Boulevard. ``And if the Russians would come in here and buy these
houses, it would be wonderful. But they're not. They're going to
Manhattan Beach. We want to see young families getting married and
buying our housing here.''
</P>
<P>
   For Oscar and Ada Kitsis, though, their three-story brick home
on Coleridge Street in Manhattan Beach is the reward for an
immigrant odyssey that began in 1976. They had arrived in Rhode
Island from Odessa with $60. They eventually borrowed money and
bought an International House of Pancakes franchise, working
18-hour days, sleeping at times in a small second-floor maintenance
room. Successful, they sold and moved to Brooklyn in 1982,
operating another restaurant in Manhattan, then a wholesale foods
business before beginning a construction and home finance company.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they plan to move into their new home in a few weeks. They
will live on the third floor, accessible by an elevator. ``There's
an elevator because, you know, I'm not getting any younger,'' said
Mrs. Kitsis, 57. The couple's daughter, son-in-law and
grandchildren will live on the first two floors. In all, there are
22 rooms and six bathrooms spread over 3,600 square feet. They tore
down the previous house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manhattan Beach is a very prestigious location,'' said Kitsis,
61, in accented English. ``It's like a village, very quiet. At the
same time, 10 blocks away you have a city.'' That city, of course,
was Brighton Beach, not Manhattan.

BONILLA'S SEASON OVER; REHAB TO START
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Bobby Bonilla,
hampered all season in his recovery from surgery to his left wrist
and left Achilles' tendon, will not play the final week so he can
begin a rehabilitation program.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla, told by doctors last winter it would take one year to
come back from both operations, has played sluggishly since he
arrived May 15 from Florida in the Mike Piazza trade. He also will
work to strengthen a sore left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla played over the weekend in San Francisco because the
Dodgers were facing a contending team and went 1 for 9. Before
that, Bonilla was on his only hot streak as a Dodger, a 20-game
stretch in September in which he batted .315 (20 for 63) with four
homers and 10 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long season, but this rehab will really let me
know where I stand,'' said Bonilla, who finished batting .249 with
11 homers and 45 RBI. ``If I had sat out the entire season, it
would be hard to pick up and begin again next year. There will be a
lot of weight lifting and running.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla will work out in Los Angeles for a week after the season
ends, then will split time between homes in Connecticut and
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   __ Hoffman and Garner: Dodgers manager Glenn Hoffman and
Milwaukee manager Phil Garner will be on same field this weekend
for the first time since the two were briefly Dodgers teammates in
1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy was really tough,'' Hoffman said. ``The first home
game I played for the Dodgers was the night he had a fight with
Mike Marshall. He was something.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman, who took over for the fired Bill Russell on June 22, is
not expected to return as Dodgers manager. Garner, a fixture in
Milwaukee the past five years, also is in danger of losing his job.
</P>
<P>
   __ Mlicki back: Right-hander Dave Mlicki, who left Friday's game
in San Francisco in the sixth inning because of lower-back pain,
will make his final start of the season Thursday against Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the same problem at the end of last year,'' Mlicki said.
``But it was not serious then and it's not serious now.''
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki, acquired from the New York Mets in the June 4 Hideo Nomo
trade, has pitched 1751/3 innings this season, including 118 with
the Dodgers. He is 8-7 with a 4.67 ERA. Last year, he pitched a
career-high 1932/3 innings for the Mets and went 8-12 with a 4.00
ERA. He also made 32 starts in 1997. This year he has 29.
</P>
<P>
   __ Osuna visits: Reliever Antonio Osuna returned to the Dodgers
clubhouse for the first time since undergoing elbow surgery on
Sept. 1. Osuna, who had bone chips removed, has begun
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   During the winter, he will fly every two weeks from his home in
Mexico to Dodger Stadium for checkups and should be ready for
spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything went really well and the doctors are very
optimistic,'' said Osuna, who finished the season 7-1 with a 3.06
ERA and six saves.

BROKERS ADMIT RIGGING BIDS IN FORECLOSURES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The bidding could not have been more public:
foreclosed houses auctioned off by a court-appointed referee on the
very steps of the State Supreme Courthouse in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   But federal prosecutors say that for at least 10 years, a ring
of real estate brokers and speculators, using bribes and threats to
keep outsiders from competing, manipulated the bidding on as much
as $50 million in property and replaced the auctions with a shadow
system of their own.
</P>
<P>
   At the courthouse auctions, which were advertised in newspapers
and open to members of the public, the ring members snapped up the
most desirable properties with low-ball bids. Afterward, the
members of the ring held secret, illicit auctions to determine who
ultimately acquired the properties, prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
   Nine real estate brokers and speculators have already pleaded
guilty to felonies, and 26 others are expected to plead guilty to
felony antitrust or tax charges Wednesday before Judge David Trager
in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, said a federal law enforcement
official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. They face
possible sentences ranging from a few months to three years in
prison and fines up to $350,000.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme dates at least from 1987, according to court papers,
and is said to have involved the court-ordered auctions of hundreds
of properties, mostly one- and two-family houses throughout Queens.
It greatly reduced the amounts that banks could recover on
defaulted home loans in the borough, and in some cases deprived
former homeowners of thousands of dollars in equity payments,
officials say. When problems with the auctions became apparent and
the authorities began to investigate, court officials changed the
system to make it less prone to abuses.
</P>
<P>
   According to court papers, the bid-rigging scheme arose in the
hurly-burly of public auctions held, according to longstanding
practice, on the steps of the courthouse on Sutphin Boulevard in
Jamaica, sometimes two or three times a day, depending on the
volume of foreclosures. The auctions were run by court-appointed
referees, whose job was to get the highest price possible for the
banks seeking repayment of their loans, but also for other
creditors and for the property owners themselves, who stood to
receive any money left over from the auction after all liens were
satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   In time, some referees and courthouse officials noticed that a
small number of bidders _ mainly brokers with offices near the
courthouse, several of them Iranian immigrants who spoke to each
other only in Farsi _ had begun to monopolize the bidding. But the
officials did not realize just how much those bidders had taken
control of the auction process.
</P>
<P>
   According to court papers, the bid-riggers designated one buyer
for a given property, who in the absence of competing bidders would
offer a low-ball price. After the public auction, the group would
meet in secret, usually at the office of a ring member a few blocks
away. There, they would hold a second auction for the property, at
which the participants would submit written bids that more closely
approached the fair market value of the property. The winning bids
ranged from a few thousand dollars to as much as $50,000 more than
the price paid at the first auction.
</P>
<P>
   The high bidder at the secret auction would then reimburse the
designated bidder from the official auction. And the difference
between the two prices _ for example, the $50,000 _ would be split
among the other participants and called a commission. Ultimately,
the winning bidder would either sell the property for a quick
profit or renovate it.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the bid-rigging group had several methods for
preventing unwitting outsiders from interfering with their system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, they would pay the guy not to bid,'' the law
enforcement official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise, they would bid up the price through the roof,
hoping the outside bidder would give up and leave. Then the winning
bidder would say: `Oops, wrong house, I made a mistake, I didn't
mean to bid on this one.' And the referee would be in a bind, and
have to rebid it.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the official said, the clique would agree not to
interfere with outsiders' bids. ``They'd say, `Give us some money,
and we'll back off,''' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   But the group did not shy away from more intimidating tactics.
Michael Reich, a lawyer who has been a referee at foreclosure
auctions in Queens for years, said he became concerned after seeing
the usual group of brokers and speculators trying to obstruct other
bidders from making eye contact with him.
</P>
<P>
   Recounting one incident when a woman tried to make a bid for the
first time, Reich said: ``They blocked her view, and I didn't see
her make another bid. When she came up to me afterwards and told me
about it, I reopened the bid, and she was the successful bidder.
They were furious. One of the guys came up to me and said,
`Somebody's going to put a bullet in your head.'''
</P>
<P>
   The bid-rigging scheme unraveled when agents of the FBI and the
IRS raided six real estate offices in February 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Reich said the auction system was overhauled more than a year
ago by Alfred Lerner, who was then the supervising justice of state
Supreme Court in Queens, and is now the presiding justice of the
First Appellate Department in Manhattan. Similar auctions are still
held in Brooklyn and Nassau County.
</P>
<P>
   In Queens, auctions now are held once a week, in a courtroom,
and are much more orderly, Reich said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got more people bidding on properties _ 100 or 200 a
week,'' he said. ``The prices are higher, the banks are recovering
more money and there are more surpluses now for other people to
split up.''

By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The woman who had imbued his life with goodness
and gaiety for almost 20 years was gone, and Bob Kersee was gamely
trying to describe an anguish that is essentially inexpressable to
a group of mostly strangers bearing microphones and notebooks.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard, and not just because the words kept catching in his
throat as he remembered Florence Griffith Joyner, who started out
as his protege at Cal State Northridge and UCLA and became, in
time, his sister-in-law and the swiftest woman to inhabit the
planet.
</P>
<P>
   As Kersee stood on a makeshift stage on the Drake Stadium track
Tuesday, sounding very much like someone whose world had suddenly
stopped spinning, life carried on all around him. The UCLA band
practiced in the infield, and UCLA track-and-field athletes
gathered nearby to gab before their afternoon workout.
</P>
<P>
   Grieving is best done far away from life's usual distractions,
but Kersee saw a salutary symmetry in addressing Griffith Joyner's
death in a setting otherwise infused with life. It was on this very
track, after all, that Griffith Joyner was transformed _ with the
help of her taskmaster coach, Kersee _ from a semi-serious athlete
to a focused, world-class competitor.
</P>
<P>
   It was on this track that Griffith Joyner laid the foundation
for her national collegiate titles in the 200 meters and 400
meters, the five Olympic medals that followed in 1984 and 1988 and
the two world records that endure, in the 100- and 200-meter
dashes.
</P>
<P>
   It was on this track that Griffith Joyner unearthed her work
ethic and helped Kersee uncover his soft side. Who else but the
fun-loving and fashion-conscious Griffith Joyner could convince the
hard-nosed, results-oriented Kersee that his athletes needed one
afternoon off a week to attend to their homework, their hair and
their nails?
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's easier for me to be here and talk about Florence
because of the nice times Florence and I have had over the years
here,'' Kersee said. ``It was enjoyable coaching her and watching
her develop into one of the greatest sprinters of all time. I guess
it's appropriate that where I had my best victories, I might (talk
about) my most devastating loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffith Joyner, 38, died in her sleep Monday morning at the
Mission Viejo home she shared with her husband Al Joyner and the
couple's 7-year-old daughter, Mary. Kersee, who is married to Al's
sister, Jackie, refuted reports that described the cause of death
as a heart seizure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cause of death hasn't been determined,'' Kersee said. ``We
unfortunately have no idea why Florence left us. It's a mystery to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffith Joyner had suffered a heart seizure during a flight to
St. Louis two years ago and was hospitalized while doctors ran
extensive tests, all of which proved inconclusive, Kersee said.
Beyond that, ``There were just no signs whatsoever that Florence
was ill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of any concrete explanation of her untimely
death, many people have been quick to draw their own conclusions.
Kersee's mood swung from woeful to wrathful when he addressed the
rumors that Griffith Joyner had used illegal, performance-enhancing
drugs while competing and that they could have contributed to her
death.
</P>
<P>
   We wish we could report that Kersee came straight out and said
that he knows of no athlete under his direction who has wittingly
used a drug, be it steroids, human-growth hormone, nasal spray or
Sudafed, to enhance performance. What Kersee said instead was more
ambiguous and therefore a lot less comforting.
</P>
<P>
   ``No athlete I've coached,'' he said, ``has failed a drug
test.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with his answer is that a lot of people in track and
field will say with a wink and a nudge that it's only cheating if
you get caught. It's hard not to be wary of all world-class
performances in view of the poll of more than 100 U.S. runners that
was taken before the Olympics in South Korea that turned Griffith
Joyner into a household name.
</P>
<P>
   The following question was posed: If I could give you a pill
that would make you an Olympic champion but kill you in five years,
would you take it?
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 percent of the respondents said they would.
</P>
<P>
   We dearly want to believe Kersee when he expresses indignation
at the very idea that Griffith Joyner could have been one of those
who answered in the affirmative.
</P>
<P>
   We don't want to believe for 10.49 seconds that any of the
athletes who awe and inspire us are risking their health in the
process. But it's awfully hard to block out the voice of
heptathlete Jane Fleming, who told the British Broadcasting
Company, ``I think (Griffith Joyner's death) is a wake-up call.
There'll be a lot of people running to their doctors today.''

SPORTS COLUMN: VALENTINE'S PROGRAM  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bobby Valentine says he doesn't believe in turning
points, but then he keeps ticking off some turning points of this
season and he gets to six or eight without even mentioning John
Franco's life-flashes-before-your-eyes strikeout last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said it was possible that his best moment in managing
this year had not yet happened. Or maybe his worst. He was not
being mysterious or mystical. Losing to Montreal, 5-3, later in the
evening would not be a highlight of the Mets' battle for the
wild-card slot in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   There was another turning point that Valentine never even
mentioned, and that was the day he put Texas behind him, and got on
with his life. He knows the stereotype is still festering away in
the hard drives and the minds of some baseball writers and fans who
observed him back when, but Bobby Valentine likes to think he has
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a slow learner,'' he said, ``but I learn. I'm only 48, but
I've had a lot of amazing things happen, and they're not over
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those amazing things could be appearing in a post-season
game for the first time. Valentine has managed 1,939 games in the
majors, counting last night, and he managed another 275 in the
minors, without winning a title.
</P>
<P>
   He set a record he does not want in Texas by managing 1,186
games _ the most by one manager with the same team without winning
a title. Pinky Higgins of the Red Sox managed 1,119 games from 1955
to 1962; he even had Ted Williams for seven of those years.
Valentine passed him, before time ran out in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The image still lingers of the brash, young manager nicknamed
Top Step because that was where he perched, heckling the opposing
players, sometimes quite personally. Even last year, Valentine
unzipped his lip and managed to alienate Todd Hundley, but this
year, ``He's changed, he's done a great job,'' said an admirer
named Nelson Doubleday, who owns half the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine thinks he has learned from the mistakes he made as a
young manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a terrible job one year, horrible,'' Valentine said,
thinking it might have been 1991, or maybe 1990, the years run
together. ``In turning points, the majority of times, I made the
wrong decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to elaborate, Valentine said: ``One time I went into a bar
where some players were drinking. I shouldn't have done that. One
time I reprimanded a player who was in no mood to be reprimanded. I
shouldn't have done that. There was one player I banked on who
didn't do it, who broke down. There were things I should have
addressed and didn't. There was no sugarcoating it. I guarantee it,
I was terrible. But I'm probably doing a better job because after I
had a bad season, I was allowed to have another.''
</P>
<P>
   He meant that Tom Grieve, his general manager then, had the
integrity to say that maybe the Rangers had not been good enough to
win a division, so he wasn't about to fire the manager.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually it was time for Valentine to move on, all the way to
Chiba Lotte. He managed only one year in Japan, but among the
highlights of listening to Valentine are the fine points he learned
from the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   How would Japanese managers handle a race like this? ``They'd be
smoking up a storm,'' he said with a fond smile.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Valentine talked about the pitfalls in Atlanta
this weekend and the potential reward of facing Randy Johnson in a
three-of-five-game series, starting in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our challenges have not ended,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he added: ``Winning the wild card was not my goal. I
collect World Series programs.''
</P>
<P>
   So, reaching the World Series is the goal? ``Winning the World
Series is the goal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The World Series programs are all over his office, where all the
Mets' managers, from Stengel to Valentine, have sat. He began
collecting programs when he opened a restaurant in Connecticut in
1979. His father-in-law, Ralph Branca, helped him locate some, and
then there were ``friends' attics, swap meets.''
</P>
<P>
   He's a baseball man. He shuddered Tuesday at the memories of
high school football, where he was an all-state running back for
three years but absolutely hated going six days without a game. Now
he is in a business where you are either a genius or a blithering
idiot every day, albeit a tad remote from his family while thinking
about the next day's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have allowed myself to feel good about the job I've done,''
he said, before a game whose turning points were nothing but
downward.

NEW RANGERS COME THROUGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Texas Rangers beat out the Anaheim Angels
in the bidding for pitcher Todd Stottlemyre before the July 31
nonwaiver trading deadline and picked up shortstop Royce Clayton
and third baseman Todd Zeile in trades. And though the three of
them got off to slow starts with their new team, they came through
when it has counted _ head-to-head against the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre is 2-0 against the Angels in the past week, allowing
only one run in 15 innings. Going into Tuesday's game, Zeile was 5
for 10 with one homer and three RBI in his previous three games
against the Angels; Clayton was 5 for 10 with three RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys have beat us,'' Angels shortstop Gary DiSarcina
said. ``Clayton had a big hit off us, Zeile's had big hits,
Stottlemyre's beat us twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Would DiSarcina like to see Stottlemyre in an Angels uniform?
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, and we would have liked to have (Tim) Belcher out
there, too,'' DiSarcina said. ``But we don't have them. It would be
nice to throw out a rotation of Clemens, Brown, Maddux, Leiter and
Finley, but we don't have them.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Rangers) are very talented. Todd Zeile hits eighth. I
mean, c'mon.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Assignment: Pitcher Ken Hill will start for the Angels
tonight, although his surgically repaired right elbow continues to
bother him. Hill lasted only 32/3 innings in his previous start,
last Friday's loss to the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   In that one, Hill pitched exclusively from a stretch position in
an effort to alleviate some of the elbow pain. But the stretch
position has been scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to make adjustments in his delivery to make him
comfortable with his elbow,'' manager Terry Collins said. ``But it
got him out of sync. He'll go back to the windup, grind it, grab
it, let it go. We'll worry about what happens in five days.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Survival: Darin Erstad was fine and ready to go on Tuesday,
one day after playing his first full game in nearly three weeks. He
survived playing on a strained left hamstring, although he can only
jog on the basepaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's any worse,'' Erstad said, ''but I wouldn't
say it's better.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the Angels simply feel more confident with
Erstad in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``With each at-bat he's getting a little more comfortable,''
Collins said. ``I feel good about having him in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad's not the only Angel with a hamstring injury. Gregg
Jefferies, who also has a bad right ankle and bruised right elbow,
aggravated his already-sore right hamstring running out a ground
ball in the first inning Tuesday night. Todd Greene replaced
Jefferies in left field.
</P>
<P>
   __ Unforgettable: Win or lose, Collins said his 1998 Angels will
be a team he never forgets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going back to my first game I ever managed in the minor
leagues, in A-ball, this team has done more, accomplished more than
any team I've ever been around,'' he said. ``I don't think you can
be on a team that makes you more proud with the way these guys have
played.''

<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ When the baseball commissioner's office was in New
York, the former commissioners from Ford Frick to Fay Vincent had
lunch in their favorite fancy restaurants. But Tuesday Allan (Bud)
Selig, the new commissioner, drove over to where he has had lunch
for more than three decades: Gilles drive-in with a neon ``Frozen
Custard'' sign on the roof.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner usually has a hot dog, but Tuesday he ordered a
grilled cheese sandwich with his usual Diet Coke. Along with a
cheeseburger and a lemonade for his visitor, the bill was $5.63.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his black Lexus sedan, the commissioner was munching
on his sandwich when several teen-age boys, students at nearby Pope
Pius XI High School, walked by. Several said hello and one had a
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Sosa going to hit a home run tonight?'' the boy asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brewers' pitching hasn't been too good lately,'' the
commissioner said, knowing that Sosa had already hit 10 homers
against the Brewers, then he laughed. ``I can say that now.''
</P>
<P>
   He can say that now because, after nearly three decades, he is
the commissioner instead of the Brewers' owner and president.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Selig is the commissioner just when all those
home runs by Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa have done for baseball
after the 1994 World Series cancellation what all those home runs
by Babe Ruth did for baseball after the 1919 Black Sox scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In the Cubs 5-2 victory on Tuesday night, Sosa walked, struck
out twice, grounded out and flied out, extending his slump to 0 for
21.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father always told me that to be successful, you have to be
lucky, too,'' Selig said. ``And with McGwire and Sosa we've been
lucky. Not just because of the home runs, but because of how
they've handled all this with such class and dignity and
graciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball would have been unlucky if, say, Albert Belle and Barry
Bonds, both surly and snarling, were hitting all these homers.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa hasn't even sounded resentful that Selig wasn't at Wrigley
Field a week ago Sunday, when Sosa hit two homers to tie and
surpass Roger Maris' 61 in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called Sammy after that game and told him how bad I felt
that I hadn't been there,'' recalled Selig, who had been in St.
Louis when McGwire hit No. 62.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, Selig was at Wrigley Field for Sammy Sosa day to
present him with a historic achievement award.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the bench before the ceremonies,'' Selig said, ``I told
Sammy, `I hope you didn't misinterpret what happened a week ago.'
And he told me: `Mr. Commissioner, don't worry. I'm not that kind
of person. I'm grateful for everything you and everybody else has
done for me.'''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire and Sosa, the magnets for a projected average attendance
of 2.4 million for each major league team this season, created what
Selig called a ``focus on the field'' rather than on labor strife.
It was that divisiveness that led to Selig's becoming the acting
commissioner before the owners voted him the title July 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``This generation lived through eight work stoppages in
baseball, but the next generation can't have any stoppages,'' he
said. ``As heartbreaking as the cancellation of the 1994 World
Series was, if we can avert that again in 2001, and I think we can,
we will have learned a valuable lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   But can another labor dispute be averted?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it can; I have a lot of ideas I don't want to talk
about yet,'' he said. ``But there's no question that payroll is the
determinant of success. For fans, baseball is hope and faith that
your team has a chance to contend. If you remove that hope and
faith from 20 or 22 teams that can't compete in payroll, there's a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   As the owner of the small-market Brewers, Selig solved one of
the Milwaukee franchise's problems by putting together the
financing for Miller Park, which will open in 2000 with a
retractable roof and natural grass. As the acting commissioner, he
had a reputation for quietly being able to persuade owners to solve
bitter problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Fetzer, the Tigers' former owner, once told me, `The best
owners and commissioners are the ones you read about the least,'''
Selig said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps with that in mind, Bud Selig intends to remain in
Milwaukee, where he has lived all his life, where he grew up
rooting for the minor league Brewers before adopting the Braves
when they moved here from Boston in 1953. He's still at his big
desk in the Brewers' tiny offices, but he'll soon move into a new
commissioner's office on Wisconsin Avenue downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be in New York half the time, too,'' he said, alluding to
Major League Baseball's headquarters on Park Avenue. ``And I want
to visit all the franchises at least once a year.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the new commissioner goes to those midtown Manhattan
restaurants where all the other commissioners had lunch, he won't
be able to get by on $5.63 for two.

   NEW YORK _ Just try to find a copy of Garth Drabinsky's
three-year-old song of himself, ``Closer to the Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   First, accounting irregularities surfaced at Livent, the
Toronto-based company he founded and whose new owners suspended him
on Aug. 10. Drabinsky denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the 496-page autobiography has disappeared from the gift
shop of the Ford Center for the Performing Arts on West 43rd
Street, which Livent developed and where ``Ragtime'' is playing.
</P>
<P>
   The official word is that the book was a sellout. ``The books
are now out of stock and have been reordered,'' said Don Nathan, a
spokesman for Livent.
</P>
<P>
   At the Ford Center, a clerk gave more or less the same answer,
but with a laugh and a smirk. That clerk and a co-worker would not
explain why they considered the matter so funny. Drabinsky's
spokesman, David Weiner, said Drabinsky was disappointed the book
was no longer available there.
</P>
<P>
   Cybill on Cybill
</P>
<P>
   Cybill Shepherd _ singer, movie and television star, feminist,
model, cover girl for the new magazine More (``smart talk for smart
women'') _ is working on a new line for her resume: author. She is
writing an autobiography, ``Cybill Disobedience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been disobedient,'' said Ms. Shepherd, who opened,
obediently and on schedule, a two-week run at Rainbow and Stars in
Rockefeller Center Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In a conversation that included mentions of Anita Hill, Anton
Chekhov and Orson Welles, she said that the book would review her
sitcom, ``Cybill,'' which CBS canceled last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When `Moonlighting' was over, I felt like I'd been let out of
prison,'' she said. ``I've forgiven Bruce Willis because I think
the show holds up so well. On the `Cybill' show, I believe we were
a little ahead of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she talked about what might have been: namely, another
season. ``I asked Bruce Willis, and he didn't come on,'' she said.
``We ended with the same averages as `The Nanny,''' she added,
referring to the Fran Drescher sitcom that CBS renewed.
</P>
<P>
   Honorary Job, But Real Work
</P>
<P>
   Mariah Carey is taking her job as celebrity spokeswoman for
foster and adoptive children seriously. She was named to the
nonpaying post on Sunday by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Nicholas
Scoppetta, the commissioner of the Administration for Children's
Services. Tuesday, surrounded by a dozen or so foster-care
children, she videotaped a public service announcement on the front
stoop of a brownstone on West 139th Street. The stoop belonged to a
neighbor of Anne Williams-Isom, an assistant commissioner for
Scoppetta.

   And Next Week, It Goes to Storage
</P>
<P>
   Robert Isabell has gone back to planning parties _ he is doing a
wedding in Saudi Arabia and several parties at the Museum of Modern
Art, among other events. He almost makes the challenges ahead sound
easy compared with the one just finished, creating a sanctuary for
the Central Synagogue inside the Seventh Regiment Armory on the
Upper East Side.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation, whose 126-year-old landmark home was damaged
in a fire last month, celebrated the first day of Rosh ha-Shanah in
a temporary sanctuary that looked anything but makeshift, what with
an elaborate painted backdrop that Isabell installed for the Sunday
night service.
</P>
<P>
   The backdrop will be used for Yom Kippur services next week,
then go into storage until next year. Repairs to the synagogue are
expected to take two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing was, it was a little brighter than the original
Central Synagogue,'' he said. ``Everybody always said it was too
dark to read the prayer books. We gave them a little more light.''

RANGERS RIP ANGELS, 9-1, INCREASE AL WEST LEAD TO TWO GAMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Right-hander Rick Helling, the Rangers' best
big-game pitcher this season, pitched his best game when it
mattered most.
</P>
<P>
   Helling, who joined Toronto Blue Jays right-hander Roger Clemens
as the American League's only 20-game winners this season,
surrendered only one run and three hits through eight innings in
the Rangers' 9-1 victory against the Anaheim Angels last night at
Edison International Field of Anaheim. Helling didn't walk a
batter.
</P>
<P>
   The victory gave the Rangers a two-game advantage on the
second-place Angels in the American League West and reduced their
magic number to four with five games remaining. The Rangers will
capture their second AL West title in three seasons on any
combination of their victories and losses by the Angels that total
four.
</P>
<P>
   The victory became a near certainty when Angels left-hander
Chuck Finley went into self-destruct mode during the Rangers'
three-run, no-hit seventh inning and a given after a three-run,
eighth-inning home run by reserve infielder Luis Alicea.
</P>
<P>
   Helling (20-7) made a one-run advantage stand until Finley
(11-9) imploded during the decisive seventh inning. Shortstop Royce
Clayton, the Rangers' No. 9 hitter, drew a leadoff walk.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers manager Johnny Oates called for Clayton to be sacrificed
to second base, but Alicea fouled Finley's first two pitches.
Alicea, however, worked the plate appearance for a gritty walk.
</P>
<P>
   Oates again called for the sacrifice, and center fielder Roberto
Kelly got his bunt down. Finley stumbled coming off the mound and
rushed his throw, and it sailed down the right-field line for a
run-scoring error.
</P>
<P>
   The errant throw later led to two more runs on a sacrifice fly
from left fielder Rusty Greer and a run-scoring groundout by first
baseman Will Clark that gave the Rangers a 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' five-run eighth inning _ the product of home runs
by Alicea, Greer and right fielder Juan Gonzalez _ only made the
defeat sting more for the Angels on a night that belonged to
Helling.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander retired the first 10 batters the Angels sent to
the plate before second baseman Randy Velarde ripped a 1-1 fastball
down the left-field line for a one-out, fourth-inning double.
</P>
<P>
   Helling responded to the evening's first and only crisis by
retiring center fielder Jim Edmonds on strikes and inducing an
inning-ending pop-up from designated hitter Tim Salmon.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers granted Helling a lead to protect before the
right-hander threw his first pitch, and it began with one of their
three reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Alicea, who drew the start for sore-kneed second baseman Mark
McLemore and hit leadoff, drew a five-pitch walk from Finley.
Alicea advanced a base on the ensuing error by Angels third baseman
Troy Glaus, who failed to field a slow chopper off the bat of
center fielder Roberto Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Alicea and Kelly advanced 90 feet on a potential, double-play
comebacker to Finley, who did not field the ball cleanly and
settled to retire Greer at first.
</P>
<P>
   Finley pitched around Gonzalez with first base open and issued a
walk to load the bases for Clark, who lined the first pitch into
left field for a run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, though, escaped further damage when catcher Ivan
Rodriguez lined into an inning-ending double play, and the Rangers
could not convert on their scoring opportunities during the third
and fourth innings.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez attempted to score from second on a two-out single by
Rodriguez to center, but Edmonds charged the well-hit ball hard and
fired a one-hop strike to the plate. Catcher Matt Walbeck blocked
the plate and never gave Gonzalez a chance to score on a play that
required perfect execution by the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Clatyon short-circuited the Rangers' fourth-inning threat by
getting caught on his attempted steal of second with one out and
third baseman Todd Zeile on third base. Finley eventually induced
an inning-ending ground ball from Alicea.

DIAMONDBACKS BREAK OUT BIG  
 HIT CLUB BEST 5 HOMERS, BEAT ROCKIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The Diamondbacks, who had been shut out twice in a row
and in three of their past four games and had not hit a home run in
54 innings, broke out of their hitting slump Tuesday night at Coors
Field.
</P>
<P>
   To what degree?
</P>
<P>
   They tied a club record by sending five balls out of the yard
and collected 12 hits. There was so much offense in Arizona's 8-6
victory over Colorado, that Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter
said, ``It was like an Arena football game.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most important thing of all for the Diamondbacks
(63-95) was it means the expansion club won't lose 100 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been talking about it for awhile. You don't want to lose
100 games. We're glad we won 63. It's a big relief,'' said rookie
first baseman Travis Lee, who hit his 21st home run of the season
and made a key appeal play on defense to cut short a Colorado rally
in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter also seemed a bit relieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, it's important for the players and for the
organization,'' he said. ``But in a few years, maybe in won't be
that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Devon White was at the head of the parade. With
two outs in the first, he sent a pitch from right-hander Jamey
Wright over the fence in center field. Lee followed with an infield
hit to deep shortstop, and Matt Williams singled to left. The ball
got past left fielder Derrick Gibson for an error, allowing Lee to
score.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-0 lead didn't last long, as Darryl Hamilton led off the
bottom of the first with a single off left-hander Omar Daal. Two
outs later, Dante Bichette slugged his 22nd homer of the season for
a tie at 2. His team would finish the night with four homers.
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Karim Garcia hit the first pitch from Wright into
the right-field stands for the first of his two homers on the
night, and catcher Kelly Stinnett followed with a boomer to left.
It was the ninth time that the Diamondbacks have hit back-to-back
home runs. The most recent occasion was Aug. 20, when Andy Fox and
Tony Batista made the connections.
</P>
<P>
   Rockies second baseman Mike Lansing led off the second with the
first of his three homers on the night, and Colorado was looking
for more when it loaded the bases with two outs. But Bichette
grounded into a fielder's choice to allow Daal to escape.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's homer leading off the sixth made it 5-3, but the Rockies
tied the score at 5 on Lansing's second homer, a two-run shot.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado (75-83) had a chance to move into position to take the
lead when Wright sent a ball to left field with one out that went
off Andy Fox's glove, but an alert play by Lee short-circuited the
rally.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was watching Wright, who was watching Fox. Wright stumbled a
bit, Lee said, and apparently didn't notice that he missed first
base. The key was, did first-base umpire C.B. Bucknor see it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him (Bucknor) if he saw it, probably a bit too loud
because I wondered if they (Rockies) heard me, but he didn't say
anything,'' Lee said. ``I knew by the look on his face that he did,
so I made the appeal. It's funny. I've been watching guys (runners)
for a long time, and this is the first time that anything has ever
come of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Daal got Hamilton on a tapper back to the mound for the third
out, and left the game for a pinch-hitter in the top of the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   That pinch-hitter, Brent Brede, moved Stinnett to second with a
single after Stinnett had singled to lead off. With two outs, White
singled to left and Stinnett scored, barely ahead of the Rockies
cutting off the ball and throwing to third to get Brede for the
third out.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia's second homer, a two-run, opposite-field shot that
barely got over the fence near the corner in left, made it 8-5 in
the top of the eighth. Lansing's homer off right-hander Aaron Small
came in the bottom of the frame.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth, right-handed closer Gregg Olson came on to strike
out two of the three men he faced, including star outfielder Larry
Walker (who was a pinch-hitter) to pick up his 29th save.
</P>
<P>
   Daal (8-12) got the win despite giving up five runs on seven
hits and walking four.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strange. I had been losing despite not giving up many
runs (his last two losses were shutouts), but I gave up a lot this
time and I still won. I'll take it,'' a smiling Daal said. &QL;

FORGET THE GIPPER; WIN THIS FOR YOURSELVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It was not your typical rah-rah,
let's-go-get-'em, win-one-for-the-Gipper speech that so many
coaches and managers tend to lean on in times like this.
</P>
<P>
   Call it more of a gentle reminder.
</P>
<P>
   With a little help from his friends.
</P>
<P>
   There were no raised voices, was no looking over their
shoulders, was no finger pointing.
</P>
<P>
   When Rangers manager Johnny Oates gathered his players for a
brief get-together Monday night at Edison International Field, less
than two hours before the start of this, his team's most critical
series of the season, he had four points he wanted to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make a personal commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Play with integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't leave anything on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Have some fun out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider it a four-star performance, at least in the first two
games of this series between the American League West leaders. The
Rangers' 9-1 triumph against the Angels in Game 2 last night gave
them a two-game lead to work with heading into the final five games
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are things we believe in as an organization,'' Oates
said. ``After the way we played those last two games at home
against Oakland, I thought that it was important that we talk about
our approach to this series.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers arrived here having blown a two-game lead by losing
two of three to the A's while the Angels were taking two of three
from Seattle. But Todd Stottlemyre and Rick Helling dominated the
Angels' lineup in Games 1 and 2 of the series and the Rangers
provided plenty of run support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important that we leave everything else behind us and
focus strictly on what was ahead,'' second baseman Mark McLemore
said.
</P>
<P>
   The season, Oates said, had been reduced to a best-of-seven
series, and winning the first game was critical.
</P>
<P>
   The team meeting was brief, and Oates invited only two players
to speak: first baseman Will Clark and closer John Wetteland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picked one player to represent the position players and one
to represent the pitchers,'' Oates said. ``I knew those two guys
wouldn't be embarrassed or afraid to speak their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Both, Oates said, emphasized that it was important that each
individual player take care of business and focus on the job at
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until the two Oakland games, we've played better than we
have at any time this season since April, maybe better,'' Oates
said. ``In April, we were winning a lot of games, 10-8. We're
getting more consistent starting pitching now than we were then.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is pitching, Oates insists to anyone who stops by, that
will decide this championship dogfight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every conversation I have, that's what it eventually gets back
to,'' Oates admitted. ``It's not an easy road, but if we go out and
pitch decently, we'll win. I've been saying that for six months
now, and it's still true with less than a week to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't pitch, we'll be fighting for our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   This series and the four games which follow it _ in Seattle for
the Rangers and in Oakland for the Angels _ culminate an almost
mystifying season.
</P>
<P>
   If I'd told you on April 1 that the Rangers would get a
44-homer, 156-RBI season from Juan Gonzalez; that catcher Pudge
Rodriguez would be in the batting race for most of the season; that
Will Clark would have his most prolific offensive season since
arriving in Texas; that four Rangers players would score more than
a hundred runs (they're almost there); that Helling and Aaron Sele
would have more victories by a Rangers starter since Kevin Brown in
1992; and that John Wetteland would set a team record for saves
(42), you would have felt pretty good about this team's chances,
wouldn't you?
</P>
<P>
   And if I'd told you that their chief competitor's player of the
year (Gary DiSarcina) would be a .286-hitting shortstop with 54
runs batted in? And that that team's second-best starting pitcher
would begin the season 0-8 in the minor leagues? Or that its best
hitter would be injured and relegated to DH duty for almost the
entire season?
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like the script for a Rangers runaway, right?
</P>
<P>
   Yet, here we are, deep into this nail-biter's final chapter, and
we still don't know who dunnit.
</P>
<P>
   Or in this case, who's going to do it.
</P>
<P>
   And something tells me who won't until the last sentence of the
last paragraph.

ESPN DEPLOYS TEAM OF 130 FOR `SUNDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GINTONIO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - ESPN-TV has taken over Sun Devil Stadium for one
of its ``Sunday Night'' ``Football'' telecasts. The circus has come
to town.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody is running into (or away from) someone; some are
whispering, others screaming. They are hours away from the finish
line, and at times they're counting the minutes until they can sack
out.
</P>
<P>
   Not Mark Levy.
</P>
<P>
   Oblivious to the near-chaos around him on the outskirts of Sun
Devil Stadium last weekend, Levy, who runs the super slo-mo camera,
was stretched out on the floor, sound asleep beneath a work space
in a trailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on back during the game,'' Levy says when roused from his
slumber by a couple of interlopers. ``I might be sitting up by
then.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever works. And most of what the ESPN crew, 130-plus strong,
does works. There are 80 members of the core team who are on the go
for more than four months.
</P>
<P>
   Levy's life is even more nomadic than most. Take last weekend,
for example. On Saturday, he was in Columbus, Ohio, to do the Ohio
State-Missouri game. As soon as Sunday night's game was over, it
was time to head to New York for Monday night's Cowboys-Giants
game.
</P>
<P>
   Though the focus Sunday was on two winless teams, the Cardinals
and the Eagles, the excitement behind the scenes with ESPN was
evident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows how to do this,'' operations producer Phil
DePietro said. ``I like to come here in the morning and say hi and
then say good night at the end of the day. I think our people are
that good.''
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes, good is only the first step. The big bosses in
the trucks say they want perfection. Even a lapse of a second or
two _ in going from the live action to a commercial, for example _
can interrupt the flow.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the crew for Sunday's game came to town Friday, doing
the groundwork, rolling out the 10,000 feet of cable and wires,
putting the hundreds of plugs into the right outlets, and then
hoping no one accidentally kicks something out of place. Every wire
is coded, but most look at the maze of wires and are happy that
somebody else knows how to hook up all this stuff. &QL; 
Local flavor &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few hours before kickoff, there is still a lot to do. While
play-by-play man Mike Patrick is in the stuffy broadcast booth
doing voice-overs and flicking ashes from a cigarette into a
plastic cup half-filled with a soft drink, DePietro is down on the
blacktop, where the thermometer is stuck at 111 degrees. He's
looking over 20 locals who have been selected to run the field
alongside the cameraman to make sure that no wires get crossed.
</P>
<P>
   This gang, which has a great view of the game and gets a few
bucks as well, is genuinely pleased. Like others around the
country, they are usually college students lucky enough to be in a
class taught by a professor who is an ESPN contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did this as a curiosity,'' said Mike Connelly, a journalism
student at Arizona State University. ``You can't see too many games
from the field. I'd probably do this for free.'' &QL; 
Down to the second &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the two trucks that ESPN brings to every game, producers,
directors, graphic experts, sound personnel and technicians are
checking and double-checking, like pilots getting ready for
takeoff. They try to anticipate almost everything that might
happen, but last-second changes are common. Working on the fly is a
given in televised sports.
</P>
<P>
   For a Sunday night game, 24 cameras roll at all times, including
eight on the field. In contrast, most of ESPN's Saturday college
football games are done with six cameras.
</P>
<P>
   And when the senior coordinating producer, Fred Gaudelli, wants
something, it better be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to be prepared for all situations,'' Gaudelli said.
``We did a Lions game, and Barry Sanders had 215 yards at halftime.
We didn't have a graphic ready for that, so we had to build one on
the fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have researchers at every game who try to be on top of
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   In the truck, Gaudelli, like most producers, operates at a
frenetic pace. If something, or someone, is a second late on a
matter he deems important, he isn't bashful about expressing his
feelings. It's not a place for the thin of skin. But the egos
aren't as large behind the camera as in front, and what happens in
the truck is usually left in the truck, those in the business say.
</P>
<P>
   An important part of the timing involves a person on the
sidelines known as ``Orange Sleeves'' or ``Orange Gloves.'' That
person, highly visible, is in contact with the truck on the exact
second to begin and end TV timeouts. ESPN employs its own Orange
Man, but for other Cardinals home games, the job usually falls to
Mike Jurecki, a reporter for KGME-AM (1360). &QL; 
In the booth &QL; 
But everyone knows that the stars of this shindig are the three
guys in the booth. Patrick is joined by his partner of 10 years,
former quarterback Joe Theismann, and prodigal son Paul Maguire,
who was at ESPN years ago before moving to NBC. The two come at the
game from different angles, and Patrick said that's why the
three-in-a-booth concept works so well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not hard for me to back off,'' Patrick said. ``The most
important thing is the broadcast as a whole. The play-by-play man
has to do what makes the broadcast better.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick said the height of the booth at Sun Devil Stadium makes
his job tougher since he doesn't like to look at monitors until a
play is over. Before the kickoff, he wonders aloud, ``Is that the
field down there?''
</P>
<P>
   The trio's chemistry is obvious. The knock on Theismann over the
years has been that he talks too much. Patrick said that problem is
long gone, but he understands why the feeling remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people get stuck with a label,'' Patrick said. ``If
Mother Teresa robbed a bank, she'd always be a bank robber.''
</P>
<P>
   Theismann and Maguire have joined a couple of reporters for a
pregame meal in the press box at Sun Devil Stadium, and it's
obvious that they like to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   Maguire likes to pick his spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why give an opinion nobody cares about?'' he said. ``This
isn't radio, where you have to paint the picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of joy in this job. It's the best seat on the
house. I've never been far away from football. I played for 11
years, and most people thought that was about three years too many.
Right now, the most challenging part of the job is to get to the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he learned a valuable lesson years ago: Not to tell the
studio host too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never tell him anything good that you want to use,'' Maguire
said. ``He'll use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick, Theismann and Maguire start their prep work early in
the week. Now, about 40 minutes before game time, they had some
odds and ends to take care of, such as getting on makeup, going
over depth charts and checking over their notes.
</P>
<P>
   Kickoff. Time for the circus to begin. The real work has already
been done. &QL;

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Sept. 23:
</P>
<P>
   The race between Alfonse D'Amato and Charles Schumer for the
U.S. Senate hit the rancor level so fast that D'Amato's ``Two
Mayors'' television commercial _ in which Rudolph Giuliani and
Edward Koch vie for the right to say that Al D'Amato is ``the best
senator New York has ever had'' _ may be as good-humored as this
campaign is going to get. Never before have Giuliani and Koch
looked like the most cuddly people in town.
</P>
<P>
   The two mayors of New York City can be seen endorsing D'Amato on
channels in their hometown, while upstate the senator is running
ads aimed at firing up suspicion of New York City politicians. But
Koch and Giuliani inadvertently get their own revenge. The force of
their personalities is so strong that the product they are
endorsing absolutely vanishes. Neither has ever looked more fit,
more good-natured, more full of vigor. D'Amato can barely be
glimpsed in a tiny photo in the end. The mayors look bigger than
life, while the junior senator seems to be shriveling.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers who take the ad seriously might wonder whether Koch
really thinks D'Amato is a better senator than, say, Kenneth
Keating, Jacob Javits or Robert Kennedy, let alone Martin Van
Buren. They might also recall that just four years ago, Giuliani
was warning them to vote for Mario Cuomo over George Pataki in
order to keep New York City clear of D'Amato's pernicious
influence. But good pitchmen are seldom subjected to serious probes
of their sincerity. After all, Koch, who does not drive, once
endorsed a line of tires.
</P>
<P>
   So far Giuliani has limited his career in commercials to public
service announcements. But, as his critics have pointed out, no
matter whether his topic is recycling or mass transit, the real
subject is always Rudy Giuliani. The two mayors' feelings about
D'Amato hardly count in this ad, since the endorsers have taken it
over for themselves.

   PHOENIX - You can go to the ends of the Earth, which he has, and
still not escape the Bulls. You can hole up in a Montana cabin for
the summer and find you're right back in the middle of the big
city. You can hang out with friends in a Sioux tribe, searching for
eternal peace, and end up talking about Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never ends,'' Phil Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   No, it doesn't. Not even when you insist it's over.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, former ringleader of the world's largest circus, is
coming to Phoenix for a speaking engagement Sunday at the Phoenix
Civic Plaza. He is here to talk about his spiritual journey, how
concepts like Zen and meditation and yoga translate to athletic
performance.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, it is a belated tour for his 1995 best-seller,
``Sacred Hoops.'' Only it's serving as a fund-raiser for his best
friend, ex-teammate and ex-senator Bill Bradley, who likely will
make a run for the presidency in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, everywhere he goes, people want to know about the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week alone, Tim Floyd visited Jackson at his home.
Floyd is the Bulls' coach-in-waiting, a guy who said he'll wait if
Jackson wants his job back.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Michael Jordan. When asked for the zillionth time
if he'd play for Floyd, Jordan refused to refuse, contradicting his
previous stance. Jordan simply shrugged his shoulders and made a
goofy face.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Scottie Pippen, rehabilitating from back surgery, a
man who might close out his career in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Except there's a new round of speculation. A theory that goes
like this:
</P>
<P>
   Under the current lockout, the NBA season will not start on
time. As negotiations go nowhere, the two parties will agree to
bargain under a set framework so the season isn't a total wash.
With a shortened campaign, Jordan agrees to come back. Pippen signs
a one-year deal with the Bulls to prove he's healthy. And maybe
Jackson hops on board, too.
</P>
<P>
   It is all lunacy but business as usual for the Bulls. Chaos
management made Jackson so popular in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Not that everyone likes him. Pat Riley thinks Jackson is full of
himself, and the feeling is mutual. Jeff Van Gundy has openly
mocked the Zen approach, wondering how many victories it would
produce without Jordan. And during the last two NBA Finals, Jackson
was widely ripped for coddling of Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Bulls overcame a mini-crisis to squelch the Utah
Jazz in the Finals, Jackson found redemption. Rodman never became
too great a distraction for his teammates. Jordan openly credited
Jackson's unique approach, saying it guided the Bulls through their
roughest postseason of their reign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis is a person who is totally bored 95 percent of the
time,'' Jackson said. ``He suffers from the lack of ability to
concentrate. As soon as Dennis slowed down, he fell asleep. In the
normal team context, guys can't take (Rodman's antics). They want
to act out, and pretty soon, you have anarchy. But we all
understood this was a person who was always going to break the
rules. He couldn't help it. But our players understood that.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for Michael, he just worked with the philosophy. Last year
was not an easy year for him. A year in which he found himself
carrying the team more than he had to. It was a real stressful year
for him, and I know for a fact that during the playoffs, he was
getting only a few hours of sleep during the night. He used (Zen)
to find the relaxation he needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Like him or not, Jackson's heart is in the right place. He
blazed a new trail in the coaching profession. And he may not be
done just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``As many times as I played basketball in my own career, I can
only think of two dozen times where I lost myself in the game, when
the game was me and I was the game,'' Jackson said. ``We can do
that much more frequently. That's what Eastern thought does. It
helps you get in the position when players can release their mind,
where it doesn't get in the way of performance.'' &QL;

MONTANA QB COMMITS TO WASHINGTON STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ He is another tall quarterback with a strong arm who
lives in Montana. He also happens to be Ryan Leaf's first cousin.
Washington State hopes Matt Kegel will have more in common with
Leaf once his college football career concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Kegel verbally committed to attend WSU. He then made a
vow to return the Cougars to Pasadena, just like his cousin did
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to win the Rose Bowl instead of go down there and lose
it,'' he said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5, 205-pound Kegel from Havre High School completed
111 of 222 passes for 1,540 yards and 19 touchdowns last year. This
season he has passed for 800 yards and 7 TDs.
</P>
<P>
   SuperPrep magazine, which rates prep recruits, considers Kegel
to be the 12th-best high school quarterback in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, after passing for 330 yards and two TDs against
Park County High of Livingston, Kegel talked on the phone with WSU
coach Mike Price.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came back and said he just got off the phone with coach
Price and decided he wanted to go to Washington State,'' said Greg
Kegel, Matt's father.
</P>
<P>
   Kegel said his decision came down to Price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everytime I talked to Washington State it was always coach
Price,'' he said. ``That was a big thing, talking to the head
coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Leaf, who led the Cougars to the Rose Bowl last year, Kegel
has size and agility. He has been timed at 4.6 seconds in the
40-yard dash. Last year he was an all-state basketball player,
averaging 17 points and 12 rebounds. He finished second in the
state track meet last year with a 45-foot triple jump and has been
measured at 21 feet in the long jump.
</P>
<P>
   Kegel said he welcomes comparisons to Leaf.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good. Maybe it will make me perform better,'' he said.
``The comparisons are always going to be there. I'd better be able
to deal with it and hopefully live up to the expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Kegel is a pocket passer but can scramble if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every coach who watches his highlight films mentions his
footwork,'' Greg Kegel said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides having what SuperPrep calls a ``rifle arm,'' Kegel has
been impressive with his ability to read defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Kegel also kicks for his team, going 27-for-27 on extra points
last year and owning a 41.3-yard punting average.
</P>
<P>
   Kegel chose WSU over Washington after sifting out Purdue,
Arizona State and Montana among other late suitors like Florida and
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars won what Kegel termed in August ``a big battle''
with the Huskies. Kegel had a difficult time deciding.
</P>
<P>
   His father said Kegel wanted to make sure he had a coach who
looked out for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Price was able to really connect with Ryan,'' Greg Kegel
said. ``Matt saw that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kegel wanted to play for a passing school and one that was
somewhat close to home. Through his relationship with Leaf, Kegel
developed a friendship with Price and fondness for the WSU program.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kind of became a Cougar fan,'' Greg Kegel said. ``It came
down to loyalty to Washington State.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies were narrowly edged.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have terrific people at Washington,'' Greg Kegel said,
mentioning offensive coordinator Scott Linehan and wide receivers
coach Cary Conklin in particular. ``Coach (Jim) Lambright ... I
don't know if you could find a finer person.''
</P>
<P>
   Havre, population 12,000, is 110 miles northeast of Leaf's
hometown, Great Falls. The north-central Montana community about a
nine-hour drive to the Palouse.
</P>
<P>
   Pullman has taken criticism for its remoteness and supposed
unattractiveness to recruits, but for Kegel it was a positive
factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the way Pullman resembles my hometown,'' he said. ``I
made up a whole page of pros and cons. For me, WSU came up with
more pros than cons.''

WRIST INJURY MAY SIDELINE MILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Cardinals outside linebacker  &UR; Jamir Miller has
the most examined left hand in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who suffered a dislocated wrist in Sunday's 17-3 victory
over Philadelphia, will have the injury examined by a Phoenix hand
specialist today to determine the severity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been around a dislocated wrist,'' Coach  &UR; Vince
Tobin said. ``I've never heard of one happening. It doesn't happen
much outside of football.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury has restricted Miller from moving the wrist from side
to side.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can put a cast on it and he can play, that would be
great, but we don't know,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the best-case scenario would be that Miller misses
Sunday's game in St. Louis but returns to practice next week after
the wrist stabilizes.
</P>
<P>
   The worst-case scenario is that surgery is necessary and he
misses most or all of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Miller wanted to go back into the game Sunday, but team doctors
wouldn't allow it. He was replaced by  &UR; Patrick Sapp, who came off
the bench to get four tackles in the win over the Eagles. &QL; 
Good, bad news &QL; 
Starting center  &UR; Aaron Graham, who has missed the past two games
because of a sore calf muscle, is expected to return to practice
today.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver  &UR; Rob Moore likely won't practice this week after
aggravating his sore hamstring against the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   If Moore doesn't play,  &UR; Eric Metcalf likely will start opposite
 &UR; Frank
 &UR; Sanders, and  &UR; Ronnie Anderson will be activated for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rob feels the same as he did at the start of last week,''
Tobin said. ``A hamstring for receivers concerns you. They can
linger. It's a receiver's likelihood to run fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was claimed on waivers from the Green Bay Packers
before the start of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams also could be without their top receiver,  &UR; Issac Bruce,
who remains the NFL's receiving yards leader despite missing
Sunday's victory over Buffalo because of a hamstring injury. In his
first two games, Bruce caught 21 passes for 323 yards. The 21
receptions rank second in the NFC. &QL; 
New wheels &QL; 
Rookie safety  &UR; Pat Tillman no longer has to ride a green Schwinn
bicycle to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got something that has two more wheels than what I've been
driving,'' Tillman said of his new GMC truck. &QL; 
Ball hawks &QL; 
A year ago at this time, the Cardinals had committed five more
turnovers than they forced.
</P>
<P>
   But this season, they have intercepted three passes and
recovered five fumbles while throwing three interceptions and
losing four fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   They have a turnover ratio of plus 1, tied for fifth in the NFC
and better than they were at any time last season.
</P>
<P>
   Their three takeaways inside the Cardinals' 20-yard line are two
more than all of last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has been one of our bugaboos,'' Tobin said of the few
turnovers the defense has forced in previous years. ``You can't win
unless you are on the plus ledger on turnovers or close to even.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Cardinals had a ratio of minus 22, second worst
in the NFL. &QL; 
Get in line &QL; 
About 800 tickets remain for Sunday's game at TWA Dome in St.
Louis, meaning the Rams' streak of 26 consecutive sellouts is in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fighting McGwire mania again,'' Rams ticket manager
Michael Naughton said.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire's final game this
season is Sunday afternoon. &QL;

RICE TO RECEIVE DEFENSIVE HONOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A week ago, Cardinals defensive end Simeon Rice was catching
heat for going nine consecutive games without a sack.
</P>
<P>
   Rice said not to worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I can go out and get four or five in a game,'' Rice
said.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't get four or five in Sunday's 17-3 victory over the
Philadelphia Eagles, but he had two sacks, a fumble recovery and
five tackles.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL will reward him today by selecting him as NFC Defensive
Player of the Week.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time that Rice, a third-year pro who was the No.
3 pick in the 1996 draft, has received that honor.
</P>
<P>
   Rice is tied with Eric Swann for the team sack lead with two. &QL;

AMAZING, SUDDEN FEATS WARRANT QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Maybe Ken Griffey Jr. has the right idea. Eat a pizza.
Stay away from the weight machines. Let the heaviest thing you
bench press be your 4-year-old son. Then go out and try to hit
homers.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, if you are going to take the world by storm with some
amazing athletic feat _ be it baseball, swimming, track and field,
cycling, whatever _ you had better make sure there is not a hint of
impropriety, because there certainly will be questions about how
and why you got so good, so fast.
</P>
<P>
   Is there such a thing as a sport clean of performance-enhancing
drugs?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe curling,'' said Penn State's Charles Yesalis, a national
expert on performance-enhancing drugs. ``I'm being funny, but I'm
being serious. At the elite level, it is my professional opinion
that drug use is epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   Could an Olympic athlete, even one like Florence Griffith
Joyner, get away with using performance-enhancing drugs?
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put it this way, you would either have to be extremely
stupid or extremely sloppy to get caught,'' Yesalis said. ``There
is no confirmed test for human growth hormone. The only reason Ben
Johnson got caught was because he was careless.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is why it should be OK to question how some of our
greatest sports stars _ on football or baseball fields or in the
pool _ got so good, so fast.
</P>
<P>
   That is the question that follows Griffith Joyner into sudden,
sad and untimely death at age 38.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a fair question, since the Olympic track star who still
holds the world records for the women's 100- and 200-meter races
never once tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs?
</P>
<P>
   Is it a fair question, considering she vehemently denied the
accusations, which flowed after her out-of-nowhere breakthrough at
the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is the best question that can come from her tragic
death. The rumors about her stunning rise to world record-smasher
never died, but perhaps it is a good time for a discussion about a
subject sports fans have seemed intent on ignoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry, but there was always a very strong rumor she was on
something _ everyone always talked about it,'' Australian sprinter
Tania Van-Heer told Reuters Tuesday in London. ``I'm sorry for her
family, but she didn't think about them too much. I'm sick of
getting my (butt) kicked when it's only because I'm not on
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt intense jealousies exist between athletes.
Maybe that alone tells why so many people pointed fingers at
Griffith Joyner in Seoul, when her muscles bulged and her voice was
said to have dropped but tests did not confirm any drug use.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the innuendos about Griffith Joyner turn out to be
nothing more than rumor, Van-Heer's anger underscores that there is
a problem in track and field.
</P>
<P>
   Same thing in cycling, where the Tour de France was turned into
a blood-doping scandal this past summer. It is true in swimming,
where the Chinese women have been banned and Ireland's Michelle
Smith clocked Olympic records and no drug test could catch her
until she made a stupid mistake with another test two years later.
</P>
<P>
   And, probably, there is a problem in baseball, even though the
major leagues do not yet ban androdiostene _ a substance banned by
the International Olympic Committee, the NCAA and the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   At what cost, at what price, to what extraordinary measures do
we want our sports stars to go to achieve their victories?
</P>
<P>
   This summer, home run king Mark McGwire has been given a pass by
the adoring press and public because the stuff he takes, andro, is
permissible in his sport. McGwire is not being held up for serious
scrutiny because he and most other players and fans justify his use
of the supplement because it is not technically wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in track and field, shot putter Randy Barnes has
received a lifetime ban because he tested positive for andro. In
that sport, andro is a supplement that doctors know acts exactly
the way anabolic steroids act.
</P>
<P>
   Andro leads to increased levels of testosterone in the body.
That makes it easier to work out longer. Longer workouts make you
stronger. The stronger you are, perhaps there is a chance that your
shot put flies an extra six inches or so.
</P>
<P>
   Same thing in baseball. It would not be that hard to imagine how
a 308-foot fly ball to the wall could become a 415-foot homer, just
because you are that much stronger, thanks to those andro-enhanced
workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think baseball players are using andro and Creatine as a
smokescreen for journalists and fans to cover the use of other
drugs,'' said Yesalis, a physiologist whose new book, ``The
Steroids Game,'' addresses issues in terms suitable for any parent,
coach, athlete or spectator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a cover through a drug test, since baseball doesn't bother
to go through with that, but as an easy explanation. But you don't
find an elite athlete already in good condition who can add 20 or
30 pounds over an offseason or a year using only Creatine and
andro.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the truth is we do find athletes who bulk out and
speed up, as if overnight. It is the price of glory. It is the
price for a big payday. It is a chance to hear the roaring of the
crowd, which is us.

<P>
   They helped take the city to the brink of the Stanley Cup title
five seasons ago before losing to the New York Rangers in the
seventh game of the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   But the cheers they heard once in Vancouver will be jeers when
Coyotes Cliff Ronning, who makes his first start of the preseason,
Gerald Diduck, Jykri Lumme and Greg Adams return to General Motors
Place tonight at 7 for a rematch with the Canucks, who whipped
Phoenix, 4-1, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The four didn't represent the star factor on the Canucks team
that made the Cup run in 1993-94, but they were certainly large
factors.
</P>
<P>
   Ronning, Diduck and Lumme played in all 24 playoff games, while
Adams played in 23. Center Ronning scored five goals and 15 points
during the playoffs, and left wing Adams had six goals and 14
points.
</P>
<P>
   Diduck and Lumme, both defensemen, proved to be active as Diduck
contributed one goal and seven points, and Lumme scored two goals
and had 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great that we're all here now,'' Ronning said Tuesday.
``We weren't the stars on that team, but we were certainly great
support for the stars and we know what it takes to go that far.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crucial that a team has good role players to help take
the pressure off the stars and pick up the slack when their
production falls off. We made big contributions that year.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronning added that the foursome doesn't expect a warm reception
in Vancouver, largely because there has been bad blood between the
franchises for years, dating to a number of playoff series when the
Coyotes were the Winnipeg Jets and the teams were natural Canadian
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Those feelings escalated last year when they met in Vancouver
two days after the All-Star Game and produced a bloody affair with
a combined total of 205 penalty minutes, six 10-minute misconduct
penalties and seven game misconducts in a lopsided Phoenix win.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's exhibition featured two first-period fights. A surface
look at the roster that Phoenix Coach Jim Schoenfeld sent North
shows it has a number of heavyweights who are known far more for
penalty minutes than finesse.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Roenick, Teppo Numminen, Rich Tocchet and Dallas Drake
won't play. But Jim Cummins, Louie DeBrusk, Barry Nieckar, Joe
Dziedzic, Sean Gagnon and Brad Isbister will.
</P>
<P>
   Those six players represent a combined 1,132 penalty minutes in
the leagues they played in last season _ Nieckar had 297 in the NHL
and IHL, and DeBrusk 296 in the NHL and AHL. Nicely put, it means
the Coyotes won't be leaving their flanks exposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, that isn't the reason,'' Schoenfeld said. ``There are only
so many preseason games, and we need to see everybody play. We've
split everybody into two groups, and it's just this group's turn to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Tocchet, ``Yeah, it's the same group that went to Anaheim
and won, so they now call themselves the Road Warriors. Our group?
We're the old guys who don't get to go on the road. I guess we're
the Homers.'' &QL;

WILDCATS LINEBACKER EARNS AWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _  &UR; Marcus Bell has the name for the hit.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kyle McCann's ears must still be ringing from the hit Bell
unloaded on the Iowa quarterback in the third quarter, ensuring an
Arizona victory Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just accelerated through his face,'' said Bell, Arizona's
junior linebacker who Tuesday was selected Pacific-10 Defensive
Player of the Week.
</P>
<P>
   It's a wonder that McCann's face wasn't left to look like that
other Bell, the Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   The hit, with highlight-film impact, has summed up the larger
impact that Bell has had on the defense through three victories.
Over the past two games, he has had 21 tackles _ 10 against
Stanford and 11 against Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   A dynamically skilled offense set the preseason tone for No. 16
Arizona, which plays Thursday at San Diego State (5:05 p.m. kickoff
on ESPN).
</P>
<P>
   A transition was predicted for a program built on a defense with
a nickname. The name might be gone, but the Desert Swarm attitude
is still evident. The Wildcats have yet to give up a rushing
touchdown. Three opponents have been limited to a total of 181
yards on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's emergence is no surprise to Coach  &UR; Dick Tomey. He is a
tough, quiet kid from small-town St. Johns in northern Arizona,
where his wrestling exploits are as legendary as his football
ability. The 6-foot-2, 230-pound Bell, a running back in high
school, never lost on the mat.
</P>
<P>
   ``A wrestling background helps a football player because it's
such a tough way to go,'' Tomey said. ``You're sucking ice one
second and taking somebody's head off the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real glad Marcus got this award. He's been sort of an
anonymous player.'' &QL; 
Time machine &QL; 
Arizona has had very little time, and San Diego State has had a
lot.
</P>
<P>
   Between the Iowa victory and Thursday's kickoff, the Wildcats
have four days to prepare. The Aztecs didn't play last Saturday,
and they will have had 11 days to forget losses to Wisconsin and
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're struggling for confidence right now,'' Aztecs Coach  &UR; Ted
Tollner said. ``Being 0-2 is no fun, but we played two very good
football teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually you don't want a break so early in the season. But the
bye came along at a very good time for us.'' &QL;

L.A. County investigating medical exams on children billed to
government 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Children as young as 9 from south Los Angeles and
nearby communities were recruited by a medical clinic without their
parents' consent for gynecologic exams and other tests, which then
were billed to the government, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Promised payments of $3 to $10, more than 100 children a day
were lured to the clinic for what they were told was a blood test,
said Fred Leaf, chief of staff for the Los Angeles County
Department of Health Services.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf said it is not clear whether any crimes were committed, and
officials suspect the children were recruited simply for purposes
of billing Medi-Cal or some other government program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think, until you review all the medical charts and do
all the law enforcement interviews, that you can determine that,''
said Leaf, who gave a report Tuesday to the Los Angeles County
Board of Supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear whether the clinic remained in
operation, but Los Angeles County officials said they had not moved
to close it because it was not within their jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the District Attorney's Office,
confirmed that investigators were conducting an inquiry and that no
arrests had been made. But Gibbons declined to provide additional
details about the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Supervisors urged a quick investigation by the
state, which has jurisdiction over the programs that were billed
and doctors' conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so outrageous,'' said Supervisor Don Knabe, whose
district includes Paramount. ``We don't want them to look at this
like just another investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke said she wants the clinic
shut down for good if any criminal activity took place. ``There
must be some kind of penalty,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 14, the Sheriff's Department served a search warrant on
the clinic in conjunction with the District Attorney's Office and
the county Department of Health Services. Law enforcement officials
seized all medical records, billing documents and other potential
evidence, county officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The warrant, which remained under seal Tuesday, was served at
Paramount Medical Center, 15551 Paramount Blvd., in the city of
Paramount, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to the clinic Tuesday afternoon went unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   The county Department of Health Services will review the records
and try to contact the parents or guardians to see whether they
want follow-up medical checks of the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to go through thousands and thousands of records,''
said Leela Kapur, acting assistant county counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Health Services Department officials said the clinic appeared to
have billed both Medi-Cal and a separate state program that covers
costs related to family planning and birth control. But Malcolm
Venolia, the local supervisor for the state Department of Justice
Medi-Cal Fraud Bureau, said he understood it was only the family
planning program that was being billed.
</P>
<P>
   While county health services officials highlighted the Medi-Cal
link, Venolia said the allegation in this case was that the clinic
was billing a state program known as the State Only Family Planning
Program, run by the Office of Family Planning and administered by
the state Department of Health Services, not Medi-Cal.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the state Attorney General's Office said that
under the rules of the program, minors may apply without getting
parental consent and there are no age restrictions for eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our understanding that it was the family assistance plan
that was being billed, not Medi-Cal,'' Venolia said. ``All that
stuff with the kids being picked up, passing out condoms and pap
smears, none of that was being paid for by Medi-Cal.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Justice notified county health services
officials at the start of the month that they'd seen some of the
clinic's employees head out in a van to recruit children, then
bring them back to the clinic without parental consent, Leaf said.
He said the Department of Justice was conducting a Medi-Cal fraud
investigation into the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf convened a task force to investigate the matter, including
the county Department of Health Services, the District Attorney's
Office, the Sheriff's Department, the Los Angeles police, the state
Department of Justice and Los Angeles County counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Kapur, from the L.A. County Counsel's Office, said the Paramount
Medical Center is a private clinic that does not have any
partnership contracts or funding agreements with the county.
</P>
<P>
   Kapur said the county has little ability to regulate the
activities of such clinics, which are treated much like a small
doctor's office and do not require a license from the state or the
county. Only the doctors are licensed by the state's Medical
Examiner's Board, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have jurisdiction. There is very little the county
health department can do,'' Kapur said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the County Counsel's Office is advising the Department of
Health Services about what roles it can take as the criminal
investigation proceeds. The Health Services Department and county
counsel have been cooperating with the criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just be involved to see if there is anything DHS can do
from a regulatory point of view. We have children who received
treatment they didn't consent to,'' Kapur said.

FREEDMAN HURTING BUT WANTS TO PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. -  &UR; Mitchell Freedman's thigh strain is painful, but
standing on the sideline hurts even more.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona State safety missed Saturday's game against North
Texas because of an injury that is affecting his hip, groin and
thigh. ASU's medical staff ordered rest to help the healing
process.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect the senior to miss the game with Oregon State on
Saturday night at Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   I'm playing on Saturday,'' he said. ``That's my main goal right
now, no matter what. Even if I'm feeling it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I have to do. It's a Pac-10 game, so I have to
be there.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU coaches will watch Freedman's progress closely this week
because they fear rushing him could aggravate the injury. &QL; 
Pac man &QL; 
 &UR; Erik Flowers knew the adjustment from junior college to Pac-10
football would be tough. But he admits he had no idea how different
it would be.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils opened against Washington, which features one of
the conference's biggest and strongest offensive lines. Then came
Brigham Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look and I'm playing against 26-year-old men,'' he said.
``I'm like, `These are grown men. Goodness gracious.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Many Cougars players return to school after serving Mormon
missions for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers has improved each game and had eight tackles, two for
losses, against North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he played a really fine game,'' Coach  &UR; Bruce Snyder
said.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers admits he came to Tempe expecting too much. He had high
expectations and so did many who follow the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm from a JC, but I was expecting instant success,''
he said. ``I just have to remember I have to relax, I'm only human.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may be off the bandwagon because we lost two games but
this is a really good team that does have talent. We just gave up a
lot of big plays.''
</P>
<P>
   The defensive line will be tested against the Beavers, who
feature the conference's leading rusher in  &UR; Ken Simonton. &QL; 
Third down and out &QL; 
The Sun Devils are spending this week fine-tuning several areas of
their defense, but one that concerns Snyder most is the trouble
with opponents' third-down conversions.
</P>
<P>
   ASU is ranked eighth in the conference. It has allowed teams to
convert 34.9 percent of the time (15 of 43 attempts). By contract,
Oregon State has allowed teams to convert 10 of 46 (21.7 percent).
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defensive stats, including the score, would be much
different if we made some plays on third down,'' he said. ``The
defensive stats really expand if you give them another series.
Situationally speaking, that's one of our biggest concerns, third
and long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally, we need to be there on third down and wired in.'' &QL;

EL PASO PICKED FOR DOUBLE-A CLUB 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The El Paso Diablos of the Texas League will become the first
Double-A affiliate of the Diamondbacks starting next season, a
Diamondbacks official confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement will be made Thursday at dual news conferences
in El Paso and Juarez, Mexico, which is directly across the border.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks General Manager  &UR; Joe Garagiola Jr., Manager  &UR; Buck
Showalter and
 &UR; Tommy Jones, director of minor league operations, &UR; are scheduled to
be in El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Roland Hemond, Diamondbacks senior executive vice president for
baseball operations, Assistant General Manager  &UR; Sandy Johnson and
Director of Hispanic Marketing  &UR; Richard Saenz will be in Juarez.
Johnson and Saenz are fluent in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   It also has been confirmed that former Arizona State catcher &UR; Don
 &UR; Wakamatsu, the California League Manager of the Year with Class A
High Desert this season, will manage the Diablos. He will be joined
by his High Desert coaches, &UR; Dennis Lewallyn and  &UR; Ty Van Burkleo.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Texas League since 1962, El Paso was affiliated
with the Milwaukee Brewers from 1981 through this season. &QL; 
Hurricane worries &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder  &UR; Yamil Benitez looked out of the Diamondbacks dugout
at Coors Field and into a clear blue sky. A cool breeze drifted in,
signaling autumn's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   A beautiful scene for baseball, yet baseball took a back seat
for Benitez. He was thinking about his family, his wife's family
and their friends in Puerto Rico, which was in the path of
Hurricane Georges.
</P>
<P>
   The storm left most of the island without power or drinking
water and caused a handful of deaths, according to initial reports.
After chewing up Puerto Rico and spitting it out, Georges went
looking for more victims to the west on the Caribbean island of
Hispaniola, where the Dominican Republic is located.
</P>
<P>
   Like Puerto Rico, the Dominican is a baseball haven. The
Diamondbacks have three players from the Dominican on their roster
_ infielders  &UR; Tony
 &UR; Batista and  &UR; Hanley Frias and right-handed starter  &UR; Amaury
 &UR; Telemaco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to reach my father. He and my cousins are OK, but
we're not sure about my wife's family yet. She has been trying to
call about once every hour,'' Benitez said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before he signed his first pro contract with the
Montreal Expos in 1989, Benitez, 26, remembered Hurricane Hugo,
which also inflicted damage on parts of the mid-Atlantic states.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad said Hugo was like a baby compared to this. It's pretty
bad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going home next week (after the season ends Sunday). I
don't know what my house is going to look like, but you really
don't care about that. You want everybody to be safe.'' &QL;

COMMENTARY: HOMECOMING AT ABSAROKEE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By VERLYN KLINKENBORG  
  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At halftime in Absarokee, Mont., last Friday night, the
candidates for homecoming queen of Absarokee High School stood at
midfield, young women shivering in bright backless gowns as though
they were creatures just uncocooned. Beside each queen candidate
stood a king candidate who was also a football player with
helmet-matted hair, a running back or tight end or linebacker
carapaced in black and orange, the colors of the Absarokee Huskies.
The rest of the Huskies had just trampled off the field, and the
king candidates looked impatient to follow, detained only by
feminine hands laid lightly upon their arms. The Huskies were
trouncing the Lodge Grass Indians, from the Crow Reservation, and
the mood was high, for this would be the Huskies' first victory of
the season, 42-8.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies had made all the pregame noises required of football
players pumping up for a homecoming game. They groaned and grunted
and thumped each other on shoulder pads and helmets. Yet they
seemed to be trying these noises on for size, as though they didn't
quite believe in the ferocity they showed or weren't quite certain
for whom they were showing it. The psychological distance from the
bleachers to the playing field, even in a small town like
Absarokee, is as great as that from the dress circle to a Broadway
stage. The players felt it. Even the water boy felt it, running in
self-conscious haste to the loose huddle that formed onfield at
timeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Rain was expected, and fans had parked directly behind the
bleachers in case of it. But the rain held off, and so the pep band
played and the cheerleaders labored almost ironically and students
strolled back and forth along the cinder track in front of the
bleachers as if it were a midway of sorts, while on the field a boy
named Wilcox was being tackled by a boy named Rides the Bear or
Three Irons. Young cowboys walked past riding their hips as though
they were horses. Girls walked past in knots of four or five,
borrowing babies from the hands of the mothers they passed.
Children played in the sand pit where broad-jumpers would land
during track season. Everyone felt the season pivoting, as if the
giant illuminated ``A'' on the hill above Absarokee High stood
suddenly for Autumn.

READY TO GO  
 SUN DEVIL RETURNS TO VOLLEYBALL AFTER LAYOFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Robyn Mattingly heard it all about her three-day
career at Long Beach State.
</P>
<P>
   That the volleyball practices were too difficult. That a
boyfriend was responsible. (``I didn't even have one,'' she said.)
Even that she was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents, family and close friends know the truth. Yes, she
was homesick, but most of all she had burned out on athletics that,
at the end of her time at Mesa Mountain View High School, became
too consuming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like playing any more,'' said Mattingly, who
knew upon boarding the plane back to Arizona that she wouldn't be
taking up Long Beach State Coach Brian Gimmillaro on the offer to
save her scholarship. ``The players and coaches were great. It just
wasn't the place for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Mattingly belonged for a year was as a lot attendant at
Earnhardt's in Tempe. Parking cars, changing batteries, the kind of
work to put life in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   To figure out how the rush of big-time college recruiting left
her with little taste for the game. And whether the decision to
pursue volleyball instead of track was the correct one.
</P>
<P>
   ASU volleyball Coach Patti Snyder-Park remembers the initial
pursuit of Mattingly, who played only one full season of club
volleyball, as a shark fest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family was inundated,'' she said of Mattingly's coming out
with Club Red during a February 1997 tournament at ASU. ``Her
parents couldn't watch matches. It was the worst of recruiting.''
</P>
<P>
   The college track train never left the station because Mattingly
committed to play volleyball at Long Beach State before her
greatest prep success: a state title in the 100-meter hurdles and
4x400 relay for the 1997 Class 5A championship team.
</P>
<P>
   ASU track Coach Greg Kraft has had a brief conversation with
Snyder-Park about Mattingly. But she is plenty busy readapting to
academics, learning a new volleyball position and catching up to
teammates and Pac-10 opponents with more experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm really interested (in track), I'll probably go to
them,'' Mattingly said. ``Right now, I haven't even thought about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the 6-foot former middle blocker is trying to learn the
left-side hitting position and, to a lesser degree, the right side.
She also must improve her blocking and ball control, all on
unpredictable playing time.
</P>
<P>
   Mattingly sat out in a win against Washington last week, then
played in three of four games and got 11 swings at the ball in a
loss to Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It keeps me on my toes,'' Mattingly said. ``I understand how
much more consistent others are. I'm a little behind, but not as
much as I used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder-Park says it's only a matter of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's overwhelming when you've been out for a year, but we'd
love to get her on the court this year because she's one of our
best athletes,'' Snyder-Park said.
</P>
<P>
   Mattingly says she has no second thoughts about her decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never looked back,'' she said. ``I'm glad to be close to
home where my family can watch me.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she's living at home and helping her sister Rochelle
prepare for a March wedding. Her family be will be at the Wells
Fargo Center this weekend for matches against California (3-7, 0-2
Pac-10) at 7:30 p.m. Friday and seventh-ranked Stanford (6-2, 2-0)
at 1 p.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Mattingly, 6-2 sophomore Amanda Burbridge of Scottsdale and
6-foot freshman Jami Coughlin of Glendale are critical to ASU's
long-range plans for returning to postseason play. The Sun Devils
(4-5, 1-1) last made the NCAA Tournament, now a 64-team field, in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Mattingly considered Scottsdale Community College after her pit
stop at the car lot but was won over by ASU's low-key
re-recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got permission from Long Beach to contact her just to let
her know we'd love for you to come to ASU,'' said Snyder-Park, who
made one of her recruiting contacts at the car dealership. ``I'd
like to think the fact we didn't push allowed her time to think
about what she really did want.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took her two weeks to settle in. She was like a high-strung
filly, bouncing all over the place. We love her aggression and her
passion to go up and let it all hang out.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe one day Mattingly will be the kind of player for ASU that
former Sun Devil Jenn Snyder became at Long Beach State when she
transferred there in 1996. Snyder and the 49ers reached last year's
NCAA Tournament semifinals before losing to eventual champion
Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Mattingly never formally enrolled at Long Beach State, and
because Gimmillaro released her from her letter of intent, she did
not lose a year of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he owed us one (for Snyder),'' Snyder-Park said.
``Good things come around, I believe that.'' &QL;

ANGELS DROP TWO GAMES BEHIND RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Pity the poor Texas Rangers. Little do they
know, the Anaheim Angels have them right where they want them.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have been at their best when presented with imposing
obstacles, and after Tuesday night's 9-1 loss to the Rangers, they
face their most difficult challenge yet.
</P>
<P>
   After Rangers starter Rick Helling got his 20th victory of the
season with eight stellar innings, the Angels find themselves two
games behind the Rangers with five to play. What that means is the
Angels no longer control their own destiny. They could win all five
of their remaining games and lose the division title.
</P>
<P>
   But no one in the Angels clubhouse seems ready to concede
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been around a group of guys that pulled together
like them,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said of his team.
``They've been through too many instances where they could have
said `Forget it.' But they haven't. We've always bounced back.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Angels seemed to forget Tuesday was how to play sound,
fundamental baseball. Of the Rangers nine runs, three were
unearned. The Angels made three errors, including one by starting
pitcher Chuck Finley that proved to be the final blow.
</P>
<P>
   Finley (11-9) kept the Angels close through six innings as the
Rangers led 1-0. But he asked for trouble by walking Royce Clayton
and Luis Alicea to start the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   When Roberto Kelly bunted, Finley threw the ball down the
right-field line for an error allowing one run to score and giving
the Rangers runners on second and third with nobody out.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers scored two more runs in the inning, both charged to
Finley, who fell to 0-4 against the Rangers this season and 7-16 in
his career. Finley went 61/3 innings, allowed four runs (one
earned) and four hits. He struck out seven but also walked a
season-high seven (one intentional).
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers added insult to injury in the eighth with three home
runs _ a three-run homer by Luis Alicea and solo homers by Rusty
Greer and Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it didn't really matter how many runs the Rangers
scored with the way Helling pitched. Helling gave up one run and
three hits in eight innings. He struck out five and walked none
while becoming the third Rangers pitcher in club history to win 20
games in a season. The others are Ferguson Jenkins (1974) and Kevin
Brown (1992).
</P>
<P>
   Helling was nothing like the pitcher he was last Thursday, when
the Angels ripped him for six runs and seven hits in 11/3 innings.
Fortunately for Helling, the Rangers rallied to win that one.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Helling (20-7) retired 10 in a row before the Angels
had their first baserunner. Randy Velarde doubled with one out in
the fourth inning, but two outs later he was still on second as the
inning ended.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels didn't have another baserunner until Todd Greene
singled with two out in the sixth. But Velarde hit into a force
play to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, meanwhile, settled into a groove after dancing his way
out of several jams in the early innings. The Angels made a
first-inning error _ just like they did Monday _ that led to an
unearned run.
</P>
<P>
   Alicea led off the game with a walk and took second when Angels
third baseman Troy Glaus bobbled Kelly's chopper for an error. One
out later, Will Clark singled home Alicea for a 1-0 Rangers lead.
</P>
<P>
   Finley escaped further damage when Ivan Rodriguez lined into an
inning-ending double play with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning, Finley got help from center fielder Jim
Edmonds. With Gonzalez on second and two out, Rodriguez lined a
single to center. Edmonds fielded the ball cleanly and made a
perfect, one-hop throw to catcher Matt Walbeck, who blocked
Gonzalez off the plate and made the tag.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had runners on first and third with one out in the
fourth, but Finley picked off Royce Clayton at first, then got
Alicea on a groundout to get out of it.

BELTRE BLASTS OFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Adrian Beltre is considered part of the solution,
but his story is not without problems.
</P>
<P>
   He is the Los Angeles Dodgers' future at third base, a quick
glove and a quicker bat. His talent titillates new general manager
Kevin Malone.
</P>
<P>
   But the three-run homer Beltre crushed in the fourth inning
Tuesday night to give the Dodgers a 3-2 victory over the National
League West-champion San Diego Padres is not a guarantee he will be
at third next year.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Bonilla is the incumbent, although the Dodgers have
decided to shut down his season to begin rehabbing his many
injuries. Beltre will play the final week, but Bonilla has two
years and $11.8 million left on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things this winter will dictate what happens next
spring,'' said Malone, who has conceded it will be difficult to
move Bonilla. ``But Beltre is definitely worth the price of
admission. When I was in Montreal, we moved some players along
quickly and they performed. He reminds me of them.''
</P>
<P>
   For Beltre, it was his sixth homer and gave Chan Ho Park (14-9)
the victory despite a shaky ninth inning from Jeff Shaw, who earned
his 45th save.
</P>
<P>
   It was just Beltre's fourth start in the last 32 games, and he
came in with a .217 average. Many think he was rushed from Double-A
when he arrived at midseason. But every time he plays as he did
Tuesday night, smacking Dodgers killer Joey Hamilton's first pitch
off the left foul pole to give Park all he needed, no one wonders
what all the fuss is about.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can do is stay ready,'' Beltre said. ``I take extra
batting practice to stay in shape. Tonight was great. I helped get
a win for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton (13-13) came in with an 8-1 lifetime mark against the
Dodgers. He wasn't as sharp as he was in his 1-0 victory over the
Dodgers two weeks ago in San Diego, walking Mark Grudzielanek and
Charles Johnson before facing Beltre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to throw a sinker in and just got it up,''
Hamilton said. ``He hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Park has done some heavy lifting for the Dodgers the past two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In his last start, a 5-4 loss to Colorado last Tuesday, Park
pitched a complete game and threw 137 pitches. In his two previous
starts, both victories, Park threw 136 pitches in each game.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Park, who threw 107 pitches, spotted the Padres a 1-0
lead in the second. With one out Wally Joyner singled to left and
took third on a single by former Dodger Carlos Hernandez. Joyner
scored on a sacrifice fly by Chris Gomez.
</P>
<P>
   Until the eighth, that was it.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Vaughn, in search of his 50th homer this season, nearly got
it in the second with a drive that just hooked in front of the
left-field foul line. Park came back to strike him out. He limited
the Padres' Nos. 3-4-5 hitters to one hit in 10 at-bats in the
first seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Gwynn doubled with two outs in the third, but was stranded.
Joyner walked with one out in the fourth and was erased on a
double-play grounder by Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Park sailed until the eighth, retiring 11 consecutive batters
during one stretch. But after retiring Gomez to open the eighth,
Park allowed back-to-back doubles by pinch hitter John Vander Wal
to cut the Dodgers lead to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres had the tying run in scoring position with one out,
but Park retired Steve Finley on a grounder to first and got Gwynn
on a fly to left.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw came on to pitch the ninth and immediately gave up a double
to former Angels catcher Greg Myers. After Vaughn flied to left,
Joyner reached on an infield single to short. But Shaw came back
and got Hernandez and Gomez to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Dodgers have been far out of the race in the West,
they wanted to keep Bonilla in the lineup until they were
mathematically eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   That happened Friday night in San Francisco, but Bonilla
remained at third because the Giants were still in contention.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the final week belongs to Beltre.

ANGELS FATE WAS SEALED AT TRADE DEADLINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ All the symbolism the Anaheim Angels could
stomach was delivered by Todd Stottlemyre during his 9-1 victory
here a couple of nights ago, the game that gave the Texas Rangers
control of the American League West.
</P>
<P>
   The symbolism came hard and low across the plate, often with a
wicked bend.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre pitched seven shutout innings for the Rangers and
all the Angels hitters could do was wonder: What if he'd been ours?
What if one of the other bulldog pitchers we wanted had been here
to face him? What if we'd done !ital!anything!off! before the
trading deadline while the Rangers were improving themselves?
</P>
<P>
   ``He made you realize why everybody wanted him,'' shortstop Gary
DiSarcina said of Stottlemyre the next afternoon, before the Angels
went out and lost to the Rangers 9-1 again Tuesday night at Edison
Field and fell two games back with five to play. ``Because he's a
big-game pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that third baseman Todd Zeile and shortstop Royce
Clayton, acquired with Stottlemyre by the Rangers hours before the
July 31 trading deadline, had big hits in the pivotal Game 1 of
this showdown series only reinforced the thought.
</P>
<P>
   If the Angels don't win the division, a smaller ``if'' now, the
fault will lie with general manager Bill Bavasi and the Disney
management, whose tight wallets in the winter free-agent market
left him without spare talent to trade.
</P>
<P>
   When the trading deadline passed, when 23 major-league players
had changed teams and the Angels hadn't got any of them, Bavasi
gallantly took the blame, rejecting the traditional notion that a
GM title means never having to say you're sorry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know by not doing something tonight I've created a void, a
disappointment to the ballclub,'' Bavasi said then. ``I hope it's
short-lived, that in 24 hours it'll be over.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four hours were up long ago and, bad luck, the Angels are
still feeling the effects.
</P>
<P>
   They looked at their lineup card Monday and saw Paco Martin, he
of the seven career home runs, at third base, and Steve Sparks, the
Cinderella knuckleball pitcher, starting. Then they looked at the
Rangers' lineup card and saw a 13-game winner on the mound and a
30-home-run man batting eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd Zeile, hitting eighth!'' DiSarcina exclaimed the next
day. ``I mean, come on! That's a winning team over there.''
</P>
<P>
   At which point DiSarcina, the dean, conscience and institutional
memory of the Angels regulars, delivered what sounded dangerously
like a concession speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to play error-free ball and hope they make a
couple of mistakes,'' DiSarcina said. ``We're not even supposed to
be here (in contention). We've got guys hurt, we didn't make a
damned move before the deadline....
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have thought Steve Sparks would be pitching for us
with seven games to go in a tight race? I mean, if you'd asked that
question in spring training, my jaw would have dropped.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 1, when the Angels led by one game, it was widely
predicted the fortified Rangers would soon pass them and pull away.
Of the fact it hasn't happened, there are two things to say.
</P>
<P>
   That it's a credit to the Angels players and their manager,
Terry Collins.
</P>
<P>
   And that the what-might-have-beens will be louder if the Angels
lose this race by one or two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still go back to that time (the deadline), when a lot was
written about the Angels not doing anything,'' Collins said, ``as
one of those times that could have been a minor letdown, but it
didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   That it didn't shows this is a special group of players, a group
Collins said has made him prouder than any team he's managed in his
major- and minor-league careers.
</P>
<P>
   A group that deserves the October that a trade could have
assured.
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi was rumored to be close to deals for Stottlemyre, Roger
Clemens, Juan Guzman and Carlos Perez in July. He said no, because
the price would have been too high, forcing him to break up the
young Angels nucleus of Edmonds, Salmon, Erstad and Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' effort to build from within is noble. But when they
don't make the moves that put contenders over the top, you wonder
what they're building toward, second place?
</P>
<P>
   You understand why Angels fans fail to fill Edison Field for the
biggest series of the year. You understand why as gritty a player
as DiSarcina gets an inferiority complex.
</P>
<P>
   So what if they finish second by only a game or two? If the
difference is Todd Stottlemyre outpitching Steve Sparks, the trade
the Rangers made and the trade the Angels didn't, that's all the
more painful.

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
ST. LOUIS _ The way the second half of September is going, the
Astros can only hope for an October heat wave. On Tuesday night,
their bats were frozen stiff.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Matt Morris pitched a five-hitter as the St. Louis Cardinals
sent the Astros to their sixth loss in nine games, a 4-0 defeat
before a sellout crowd of 40,739 at Busch Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The loss dampened the Astros' hopes of catching the Braves for
the best record in the National League and home-field advantage
throughout the NL playoffs. With four games remaining, the Astros
(99-59) trail Atlanta (102-56) by three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, you want momentum going into the playoffs, but if
you play too well for the entire month, then you can end up getting
cold in the playoffs,'' first baseman Jeff Bagwell reasoned.
``That's how we have to look at it right now. We're definitely not
playing that great as of late. But hopefully what will happen is
we'll start a string and get on a roll again.''
</P>
<P>
   The only roll the Astros found Tuesday was 1-2-3 as Morris mixed
his fastball, slider and curveball to keep them off-balance. The
top six hitters in the Astros' batting order went a combined
3-for-24 against Morris (7-5), who threw his first career shutout
and matched a personal best with 10 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   On a night when Mark McGwire flirted with home run No. 66, Ron
Gant did his best impersonation of baseball's single-season record
holder with a homer and three RBIs for the Cardinals, winners of a
season-high six straight games.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who remained two ahead of Chicago's Sammy Sosa (65-63)
in the home-run chase, brought the crowd to its feet in the first
inning with a high fly ball that was caught at the center-field
warning track, an estimated 390 feet from home plate. In the third,
McGwire drilled another deep shot that was caught by left fielder
Moises Alou at the wall. McGwire finished the game 0-for-4 with two
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the Cardinals didn't need their power-hitting
first baseman. Morris and Gant provided a formidable one-two punch.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Morris) has been tough on us all year,'' said Astros manager
Larry Dierker, whose team was blanked for the sixth time this
season. ``I didn't expect for us to score very many runs. Sometimes
you do, but tonight we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   In two previous starts against the Astros this season, Morris
had allowed eight runs and 16 hits in 13 innings. Take away his
last outing against them _ an 8-2 loss on Sept. 11 _ and the
righthander has thrown 15 shutout innings against the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Astros had reason for optimism before the game. Derek
Bell, who went 1-for-4 with a triple, entered with a lifetime .545
batting average against Morris. Bagwell, who went 0-for-4, was
hitting .455 against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Matt Morris you see now is different than when I
got a few hits off him before,'' Bagwell said. ``He's been tough on
us. It seems like every time out, he's pitching a great game.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros lefthander Mike Hampton (11-7) allowed three runs and
four hits in five innings _ his shortest outing since Aug. 5 at
Florida _ and fell behind by two runs in the first inning. In his
previous September starts, Hampton was 1-0 with a 0.79 ERA. He had
allowed only two runs in his previous 22 innings and looked nothing
like the pitcher who struggled to find his consistency for most of
the second half.
</P>
<P>
   But he admitted to making a couple of mistakes that figured in
the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Delino DeShields led off the first inning with a walk, and three
batters later, Brian Jordan put runners at first and third by
beating out a slow grounder to the mound. A wild pitch sent Jordan
to second, and Gant, who entered batting .273 with seven home runs
against lefthanders, stroked a two-run single to center field. The
Cardinals added another run in the fourth on Gant's 26th home run
of the season, a 408-foot shot to left field that came on a 3-2
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched McGwire so long, I figured I'd get something out of
it,'' Gant said. ``I don't think I can hit 65 home runs. Hey, you
never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton said it was uplifting not to allow McGwire to add to his
home-run total, but that doesn't mean the rest of the Cardinals'
lineup can be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you focus on one guy, the rest of the team has that much
more advantage,'' Hampton said.
</P>
<P>
   Astros reliever Scott Elarton loaded the bases in the sixth when
he hit Jordan and issued consecutive walks to Gant and Fernando
Tatis. Luis Ordaz executed a squeeze bunt perfectly to put the
Cardinals ahead 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   There were few chances for the Astros to score off Morris, and
the ones they did get never amounted to anything. The Astros were
0-for-6 with three strikeouts with runners in scoring position in
losing for the fifth time in their last seven games with St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just looking to finish strong so I can relax this
offseason,'' said Morris, who missed three months of the '98
campaign with a shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
   With their final road game of the regular season tonight and a
three-game weekend series with Chicago coming up, the Astros
realize now is the time to put this funk behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather this happen now than next week,'' Dierker said.
``We've had a few lulls during the season but not very many. We've
been pretty consistent about scoring. There have been a few periods
of about a week or so, and we seem to be in one now. Normally they
don't last long, and hopefully this one won't either.''

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ST. LOUIS _ If Randy Johnson had a vote, Trevor Hoffman would be
his guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's he got, 51 saves in 52 chances?'' Johnson mused.
``That's strong. How do you beat that?''
</P>
<P>
   The subject, of course, was who deserves the National League's
Cy Young Award, and Johnson was in polite disagreement with my pick
_ him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't be fair,'' he protested.
</P>
<P>
   But it wouldn't exactly be unfair, either. Since his Aug. 2
debut as an Astro in Pittsburgh, he has been the best pitcher in
both leagues, and I say that realizing full well Hoffman's immense
value to the Padres, as well as recognizing that Roger Clemens has
won 15 in a row for Toronto. What's not fair is Johnson, as an NL
short-timer, winds up in limbo, even should he prevail for a 10th
time in 11 Astros starts tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps if he sticks a four-K in Mark McGwire .
</P>
<P>
   Nah, we know Johnson doesn't stand a snowball's chance. But he
does deserve something well beyond a cursory mention, considering
his astonishing numbers and his profound effect on a team nobody
was taking seriously until the moment he set foot in its clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Straight away, Johnson put the Astros on the cover of Sports
Illustrated _ headline: ``Houston, We Have Liftoff'' _ and his
sudden impact has been sustained impact as well, making probable
the franchise's first 100-victory season. Tonight could be the
night, something Tuesday night definitely wasn't with the Deadbirds
clear-cut 4-0 victors on Matt Morris' five-hit shutout.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, Johnson's No. 10 becoming the Astros' No. 100 _ how
neat and tidy would that be?
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's ERA in the NL is 1.28, almost a full run better than
the next man's, the fading Greg Maddux, and Johnson trails Maddux
by just one shutout, four vs. five. His 12.6 strikeouts per nine
innings solidly beats Curt Schilling's 10.1. Speaking of which,
assuming he finishes 10-1, his winning percentage will be tops,
too. Easily.
</P>
<P>
   Big Unit looks Cy-sized to me. Even his overall numbers,
including those from his waning days of bedevilment and distraction
in Seattle, are nothing to sigh about. Johnson is 18-11 with a 3.37
ERA. His 321 strikeouts _ 28 ahead of Schilling, 61 in front of
Clemens _ are the most in the major leagues since Nolan Ryan
whiffed 341 for California in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson notes proudly, being something of a statistics freak,
that he held the AL lead ``for five weeks after I was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   He's having a splendid year, definitely ballpark with Rick
Sutcliffe's for the Cubs in '84, when he went 16-1 after being
traded by Cleveland on June 13. Chicago made the playoffs, and
Sutcliffe, a lowly 4-5 Indian, received the Cy Young.
</P>
<P>
   See, there is precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Johnson seems content to bat .500, and I don't mean
that literally (you've seen him at the plate). If he could choose
between being handed a trophy in November or being handed the
baseball in October, his decision wouldn't require much anguish.
</P>
<P>
   He has a trophy. He doesn't have a World Series ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity to help get this team where it wants to be,
where it has never been and where I haven't been, either, would be
enough of a reward,'' he said. ``These opportunities don't come
along very often, and we've got a great chance to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   A 3-6 swoon of late notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Although Johnson admitted he might be ``speaking out of school''
assuming he'll pitch Game 1 next Tuesday against San Diego or
Wednesday against the Mets _ the two most realistic scenarios _
it's official that he will. Larry Dierker said so.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, he'll also pitch Game 1 of the NL Championship Series.
And the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good plan,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   It's strange how everything has turned out. His wife, Lisa, was
watching Oprah in July when a news bulletin flashed across the
bottom of the screen (``like one of those storm warnings,'' he
said) reporting that he had been traded to the Dodgers. Frantic,
she reached him by phone just as he was about to board a plane in
Baltimore, only to find out the TV station had gotten a bit ahead
of itself.
</P>
<P>
   Because Johnson doesn't want Lisa to have any more surprises
regarding their future, he declined Tuesday to speculate on his
Astros fate beyond the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy here,'' he said, ``but I don't want her reading in
the newspaper that I'm going to be here (Houston) next year before
we sit down and talk about it. That wouldn't be fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, ``fair'' matters to Johnson. And while I appreciate
his regard for Mrs. Johnson's feelings, as far as the Cy Young
thing goes, his modesty is misguided. If he bests Big Mac again
tonight, it should be his.
</P>
<P>
   Fair is fair.

 By JERRY WIZIG  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
University of Houston coach Kim Helton, upset by UCLA quarterback
Cade McNown's claims that the UH defense played dirty and hit late
this past Saturday, returned fire on Tuesday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Conceding the Bruins' 42-24 victory was ``an ugly, mean game,''
Helton said UH played within the rules as the officials saw it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football is meant to be played high and tight,'' Helton said
at his weekly media conference. ``You smash the other guy in the
mouth. There were no flags, no roughing-the-passer calls.''
</P>
<P>
   McNown apparently was unhappy with the fact he got knocked down
16 times (by Helton's count).
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like they played us dirty _ a lot of cheap shots, a lot
of going for knees, late hits,'' McNown said Monday. ``You can see
it on video. It was just rampant in that game. It's just too bad. I
feel like they have a quality team. There are certain teams who
want to play clean, try to win. I think they wanted to do more than
just win. They were dirty. We were very, very upset.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point referring to McNown, a prominent Heisman Trophy
candidate, as ``what's-his-name,'' Helton added, ``He's lost my
Heisman vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Helton's points of emphasis:
</P>
<P>
   ``They made the mistake of thinking they were playing last
year's team (which was routed by UCLA 66-10, UH's worst loss ever).
They played a defensive team with a lot more foot speed than we
have ever had here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though what's-his-name is not a very good coach, he is a
very good player. He's just not used to throwing when he's on his
back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We got beat by 18, and they say we were dirty? Cal beat us
(14-10), and they didn't say we were dirty. Minnesota beat us
(14-7), and they didn't say we were dirty. He (McNown) should play
better and coach less.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an ugly, mean game, and they created the scenario. Who
hit who the lowest the most, I don't know. We lost four starters
hit at the knees or below. We didn't hit them (the UH players).''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not getting into a verbal battle. I have watched their
offensive line play. I would respond they created the situation
they wanted to be in. I think he (McNown) is a great player who
just made a mistake. He needs to watch his offensive line play. You
usually reap what you sow.''
</P>
<P>
   McNown also complained about the turf at Robertson Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The field was a joke,'' he said. ``It was terrible. It looked
like a fairgrounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Retorted Helton, ``They probably don't have a lot of hurricanes
in Los Angeles. If they had an earthquake that went through the
middle of their stadium, what would it look like? We had a
tremendous amount of rain around here (the result of Tropical Storm
Frances the previous week). It didn't affect us.''
</P>
<P>
   UH is playing all its home games at Robertson after moving out
of the Astrodome after last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have chosen to bite the bullet this year,'' Helton said,
alluding to plans for a major renovation of the on-campus stadium
starting next year.

LUCKY LUC LEADING KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ A year ago, Luc Robitaille returned to the
Los Angeles Kings after several seasons away from the team that
launched his career. He was determined to re-establish himself as
one of the NHL's premier goal scorers.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work out that way for the popular left wing, who once
had 63 goals and 125 points in a season. Last year, slowed by an
abdominal strain that required surgery and kept him from the lineup
for 25 games, Robitaille posted career lows with 16 goals and 40
points.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Kings' first exhibition game at the Forum on Tuesday,
Robitaille scored three goals and added two assists against the
Anaheim Mighty Ducks before a crowd of 5,203.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, who won 8-3, are looking for more offense this season
than last and can only hope Robitaille's performance was a sign of
things to come. Coach Larry Robinson said he believes Robitaille is
capable of producing much more than he did a year ago, when he was
only on a 23-goal pace before being injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should get back to the 40-goal mark,'' Robinson said. ``For
him to be successful, that's what he's got to do. But I want him to
be a more complete hockey player. That's why I'm not saying 50 or
60.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he believes that at age 32 he is capable of approaching
the gaudy numbers of his early career, Robitaille said, ``I really
feel I have to. Last year, things went well early. Then I got
injured. I worked hard over the summer. For us to win, I have to
produce.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings fell behind early on a pair of goals by Ducks center
Travis Green, then roared back with a five-goal outburst in a span
of 9:38 in the second period. Robitaille scored the first two
goals, followed by Rob Blake, rookie Olli Jokinen and defensive
forward Sandy Moger. Robitaille and rookies Josh Green and Pavel
Rosa added goals in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his struggles last season, Robitaille said the year was
not a disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I looked at the team before the season, I knew we had
something good going,'' said Robitaille, who has four goals and
eight points in his two exhibition appearances. ``When I said that
at the beginning of the year, people were shocked and had a little
chuckle going. But now, it's a whole different atmosphere. Nobody
is looking at us with a chuckle anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury update: Defenseman Jaroslav Modry suffered a charley
horse to the right thigh in the second period when the Ducks' Jeff
Nielsen ran into him. Modry did not return and will be evaluated
today. First-line center Jozef Stumpel, sidelined since the first
day of camp with a sprained ankle, has skated the last couple of
days but is not expected to play Friday against Phoenix at the
Forum. Rookie center Jason Morgan remains sidelined with knee
tendinitis, but is scheduled to skate today.
</P>
<P>
   __ Tickets on sale: Kings' individual game tickets go on sale at
noon Sunday at the Forum and at TicketMaster outlets.
Wheelchair-accessible tickets go on sale at the Forum at 11:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings will hold an open practice at the Forum at 1 p.m.
Sunday, free for season-ticket holders and $5 for others wishing to
attend. Proceeds will go to the Kings' charitable foundation.

 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Babe, Lou and Ernie have company.
</P>
<P>
   In a game that drew the smallest crowd of the season at the
Kingdome, Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez on Tuesday night
etched their names in the major league record book again as the
Mariners held off the Oakland Athletics, 7-6, before 20,908 fans.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Timlin's 18th save was one of his most difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Inheriting a two-run lead from Jose Paniagua, Timlin faced a
one-out, runners-on-second-and-third situation in the ninth inning
before a run-scoring sacrifice fly cut the gap in half. After
walking Jason Giambi intentionally, Timlin wrapped it up by getting
Eric Chavez to bounce into a force at second.
</P>
<P>
   The ribbon on Seattle's 10th one-run win of the season was
supplied by Griffey and Rodriguez, the two best players who have no
chance of playing in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Already in the record book as the third player to have a
50-homer, 20-stolen base season, Griffey drove in the two runs he
needed to reach 140 RBIs three consecutive seasons with his 54th
and 55th homers.
</P>
<P>
   He joins Babe Ruth (1926-31) and Lou Gehrig (1930-32) as the
only players to climb the 140-RBI plateau three straight seasons.
Griffey drove in 140 runs in 1996 and finished with 147 in last
year's Most Valuable Player season.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey also moved past George Foster and into 53rd place on the
all-time homer list with 349.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's impressive resume also expanded.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariner shortstop last week became the third player in
history to hit at least 40 homers and steal 40 bases in the same
season. He preceded Griffey's first homer Tuesday night with his
41st of the season in the second inning off loser Jay Witasick to
become the most powerful shortstop in American League history.
Rodriguez and Rico Petrocelli of the Boston Red Sox (1969) are the
only ones to hit 40 homers in a season.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said he doesn't know that much about Petrocelli and
asked manager Lou Piniella before the game for some information on
the former Red Sox star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to find out more about him and I'm honored to pass
such a great player,'' Rodriguez said. ``I never really like to
downplay the significance of personal accomplishments, because you
work hard all winter to reach some rewards. Unfortunately, we
haven't really done that well as a team, but maybe we can come back
and use this as a springboard for spring training.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Banks, like fellow Hall of Famers Ruth and Gehrig, is the
only shortstop in big-league history with more homers in one season
than Rodriguez. Banks holds the NL and major league record with 47
in 1958. Banks also had 45-, 44-, 43- and 41-homer seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Junior has had a lot (of milestones) and Alex is joining in on
the party too,'' Piniella said. ``It has been a heckuva year for
those two kids. It's a shame that we haven't been in the pennant
race, because those kids would garner a lot of MVP votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey kept the ball he hit for No. 54.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with his dad's 152 career home runs, the Griffey family
reached 500 career homers.
</P>
<P>
   The Griffey-Rodriguez sock is even more explosive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Together, we make a very good tandem,'' Rodriguez said.
``Junior was great before I was here, but together, I think we are
better than we would be apart.''
</P>
<P>
   For Griffey, joining Ruth and Gehrig is something to cherish.
Some day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't pay that much attention (to records),'' Griffey said.
``I just try to do what I can to help the team. When everything
settles down, I may think about it, but really now, I'm still
enjoying what I do, playing baseball. We may be out of it, but I
still get to do something I love to do.''
</P>
<P>
   His second homer of the game _ the seventh two-homer performance
this season _ ignited a three-run Mariner rally in the fifth inning
that erased the one-run lead Oakland grabbed in the top of the
inning off Seattle starter Jamie Moyer.
</P>
<P>
   Rico Rossy, playing third base in place of injured Russ Davis
(bruised right hand), delivered a go-ahead, bases-loaded double off
Witasick and the Mariners led the rest of the way. Moyer won his
seventh game in his past eight decisions to improve to 14-9 with
one start remaining.

ANGELS FALL TWO GAMES BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (WRITE THROUGH) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Apparently, something needed to be said.
</P>
<P>
   After the Anaheim Angels lost their second game in a row to the
Texas Rangers by the identical score of 9-1, one of the quietest
Angels exploded with a profanity-laced tirade in the clubhouse
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Marcel Lachemann, the manager of the 1995 Angels
club that collapsed in the season's final two months, screamed for
several minutes at the players after they played their second
horrible game in the most critical series of the season before
38,987 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Angels players would talk about the postgame
``meeting'' that could be heard by reporters in another room. But
it was easy to understand Lachemann's disgust with the way the
Angels played. The Angels got only four hits, made three errors and
were embarrassed for the second night in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers starter Rick Helling got his 20th victory of the season
with eight stellar innings (one run, three hits), which left the
Angels two games behind the Rangers with five to play.
</P>
<P>
   What that means is the Angels no longer control their own
destiny. They could win all five of their remaining games and lose
the division title.
</P>
<P>
   But no one in the Angels clubhouse seems ready to concede
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have five games left,'' said Angels left fielder Gregg
Jefferies. ``If you want to say it's over, we can cancel the five
games. But if we win (tonight), we're one game out with four to
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been here long, but I know this team fights back.
Nobody's going to quit now.''
</P>
<P>
   Forgetting the past two nights will be ``easy,'' outfielder Todd
Greene said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost two games in a row before,'' he said. ``We've been
two games out before. If this team didn't have heart, we wouldn't
be where we're at now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, though, appeared to forget on Tuesday what got them
to this point. They failed to play sound, fundamental baseball in a
repeat of Monday's performance. Of the Rangers' nine runs, three
were unearned. The Angels made three errors, including one by
starting pitcher Chuck Finley that proved to be the final blow.
</P>
<P>
   Finley (11-9) kept the Angels close through six innings as the
Rangers led 1-0. But he asked for trouble by walking Royce Clayton
and Luis Alicea to start the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   When Roberto Kelly bunted, Finley threw the ball down the
right-field line for an error, allowing one run to score and giving
the Rangers runners on second and third with nobody out.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers scored two more runs in the inning, both charged to
Finley, who fell to 0-4 against the Rangers this season and 7-16 in
his career. Finley went 61/3 innings, allowing four runs (one
earned) and four hits. He struck out seven but also walked a
season-high seven (one intentional).
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers added insult to injury in the eighth with three home
runs _ a three-run homer by Luis Alicea and solo homers by Rusty
Greer and Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we know we haven't played well the last two days,''
Finley said. ``But we've gone through this many times before. We
don't feel fortunate to be here, we feel we've played well enough
to be here. We've got 25 guys who have been grinding it out all
year. These guys have a lot of heart. In the next five days we'll
see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling gave up one run and three hits in eight innings. He
struck out five and walked none while becoming the third Rangers
pitcher in club history to win 20 games in a season. The others are
Ferguson Jenkins (1974) and Kevin Brown (1992).
</P>
<P>
   Helling was nothing like the pitcher he was last Thursday, when
the Angels ripped him for six runs and seven hits in 11/3 innings.
Fortunately for Helling, the Rangers rallied to win that one.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Helling (20-7) retired 10 in a row before the Angels
had their first baserunner. Randy Velarde doubled with one out in
the fourth inning, but two outs later he was still on second as the
inning ended.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels didn't have another baserunner until Greene singled
with two out in the sixth. But Velarde hit into a force play to end
the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, meanwhile, settled into a groove after dancing his way
out of several jams in the early innings. The Angels made a
first-inning error _ just like they did Monday _ that led to an
unearned run.
</P>
<P>
   Alicea led off the game with a walk and took second when Angels
third baseman Troy Glaus bobbled Kelly's chopper for an error. One
out later, Will Clark singled home Alicea for a 1-0 Rangers lead.
</P>
<P>
   Finley escaped further damage when Ivan Rodriguez lined into an
inning-ending double play with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning, Finley got help from center fielder Jim
Edmonds. With Gonzalez on second and two out, Rodriguez lined a
single to center. Edmonds fielded the ball cleanly and made a
perfect, one-hop throw to catcher Matt Walbeck, who blocked
Gonzalez off the plate and made the tag.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had runners on first and third with one out in the
fourth, but Finley picked off Royce Clayton at first, then got
Alicea on a groundout to get out of it.

RUSSIAN MEDIA FACING SPECTER OF CENSORSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK VIVIANO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Two weeks into the administration of Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov, questions about his government's ideological
thrust vastly outnumber answers.
</P>
<P>
   Dangling in the economic and political void are the Russian
media, a key engine of reform since the collapse of the Soviet
Union in 1991. With newspapers, magazines and radio stations
reeling from devastating financial losses as Russia's banks topple,
journalists are no longer sure whether they will have a job when
they show up for work _ or what they will be free to report.
</P>
<P>
   ``No politician likes what we write now,'' says Andrei Lapik,
deputy editor in chief of Moscow Komsomolets, one of the nation's
most outspoken dailies. ``Unfortunately, that makes a crackdown all
too possible as a response to the crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   A radio journalist who asked to remain nameless agreed: ``All it
would take is a flick of the bureaucratic wrist.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, these fears remain as speculative as the final
cast of the government, which has yet to sign on a minister of
press and information, among many other posts. In an effort to
reconcile his nation's fractious political extremes, Primakov's
goal is a Cabinet that seats free-market democrats and their
Communist adversaries at the same Kremlin table.
</P>
<P>
   ``As they watch this fascinating mutant climbing out of the
state's womb,'' observed the daily New Izvestia last week, ``the
simple Russian citizens who will be governed by this freak of
nature see that the country is faced with a complex genetic design
that could be tentatively defined as three-limbed and two-headed.''
</P>
<P>
   But staffers at leading publications and broadcast news programs
note that democrats, so far, are in the minority. And most are
convinced that some form of censorship lies ahead, in part because
the entire industry has been seriously weakened by the financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chief sign of impending political problems is the economic
crisis itself,'' said the radio journalist. Like many of his
colleagues, he worries that his job will be endangered if he speaks
openly of such matters to a reporter from the West.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis erupted, ironically, just as the press was recovering
from the effects of the Soviet demise eight years ago, which ended
government subsidies _ and control _ of the media. As newsstand
prices skyrocketed in the chaotic market that replaced the Marxist
state system, circulation plummeted at every Russian publication,
regardless of its political orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before 1990, when the price of a daily newspaper was 2 or 3
kopeks (100 kopeks equal 1 ruble), circulations were enormous.
People read as many as eight papers a day,'' said Lapik. ``Then the
bottom fell out.''
</P>
<P>
   The reformist Arguments and Facts saw its sales fall from 32
million _ the globe's highest, according to the Guinness Book of
World Records _ to 3 million. The Communist-led Pravda (``Truth'')
and Trud (``Labor'') went from a combined circulation of 30 million
to 1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors made a slow climb back to stable, if much lower,
sales after privatization. Apart from Pravda and Trud, most former
state publications moved sharply to the center, embracing
hard-hitting investigative techniques and other Western-style media
tools. Newer dailies and periodicals went even further in their
adoption of foreign habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules of the game became the same as those in America or
Western Europe,'' said Natasha Poletayeva, music editor of Cool, a
popular teen magazine. ``Our No. 1 subject is sex and love.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscow Komsomolets, known simply as ``MK'' across Russia, is the
capital's top daily, with a circulation of 700,000 on weekdays and
almost 1 million on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Its sales were 1.8 million per day in 1990. Despite
mind-boggling inflation _ at 1 new ruble, MK fetches 50,000 times
its newsstand price in '90s pre-devaluation currency _ the paper
has lost just half of its readership, the smallest decline of any
leading Russian publication.
</P>
<P>
   Although its name has not changed (``Komsomolets'' translates as
``Communist Youth League member''), MK underwent an ideological
overhaul in the early 1990s. It drew new readers with a mixture of
tough reporting and bright entertainment features.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're populist and unembarrassed about it,'' says Lapik.
``That has gained us a very broad audience, ages 16 to 60, with a
quarter of our circulation going to managerial-level readers.''
</P>
<P>
   MK attracted worldwide attention in 1996, when staff writer
Dmitry Kholodov was assassinated while investigating links between
organized crime and the world of Russia's big-business oligarchs.
Moscow Komsomolets is one of the few big dailies that has no
financial links to that world.
</P>
<P>
   Rem Vyakhirev, chairman of Gazprom, the huge Russian energy
firm, as well as two banks, also controls Trud and a TV station.
Boris Berezovsky of Obyedinenny Bank _ and a close adviser to
President Boris Yeltsin _ owns a daily and a weekly. Izvestia is
run by Vladimir Potanin, president of Uneximbank. Vladimir Gusinsky
and Alexander Smolensky, respectively the bosses of Most Bank and
SBS-Agro Bank, hold controlling interests in Russia's leading
business periodicals.
</P>
<P>
   When the banks shut their doors this month, their media
affiliates were rocked to the core. The Independent, the country's
most serious intellectual daily, halted publication for a week. At
Arguments and Facts, salaries were cut in half.
</P>
<P>
   Even publications and broadcasters without oligarch godfathers
are suffering, thanks to terrified investors from abroad and
bizarre tax policies that tie the fate of Russia's media to the
fortunes of its wobbly currency.
</P>
<P>
   Four of Moscow's top five radio stations and a majority of its
magazines are owned by U.S., Dutch, French and German companies. As
the ruble slid in value from more than 16 U.S. cents to less than 5
cents in two weeks, foreign media moguls demanded huge salary cuts
and staff reductions to protect their investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was given one day to prepare a list of ten people to be
fired from a staff of 25,'' said a magazine editor.
</P>
<P>
   Losses are also mounting fast in production budgets. Newsprint
costs rose 70 percent this month. Worse, most Russian weeklies _
and often, daily features sections _ are printed abroad, usually in
Finland or Italy, where bills must be paid in foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Unless it is deemed pornographic, a foreign-printed publication
is regarded as ``humanitarian aid,'' and is untaxable. By contrast,
``Russian-produced material was heavily taxed, and thus more
expensive _ until now,'' said Moscow Komsomolets editor Lapik.
</P>
<P>
   The sum result, said a magazine editor, ``is that we are caught
in the middle. If the new government doesn't help us out, we'll go
into bankruptcy. If they do, we must assume they'll want something
in return.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Lapik: ``We are about to pay our debts for dreaming over
the last five years _ for living on the illusion of prosperity and
freedom.''

US RETRENCHES AFTER MODERATE CANDIDATE LOSES IN BOSNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Stunned after a pro-American, moderate candidate
conceded defeat Monday in the recent Bosnian elections, the Clinton
administration now must consider what to do next in the fledgling
country.
</P>
<P>
   The painful answer may be nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Several specialists who helped the administration forge the
Dayton peace accords in 1995 and now oversee deployment of
peacekeeping troops say that the election results prove that the
West cannot micromanage Bosnia. Indeed, it must accept the apparent
winner of the contest for the Serbian presidency, extreme
nationalist Nikola Poplasen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like Serbia to be a multi-ethnic, prosperous, democratic
country,'' said Ivo Daalder, who coordinated the peace negotiations
and the first stages of the Dayton accord as director of European
affairs of the National Security Council at the White House from
1995-97. ``But if the people themselves don't want it, who are we
to tell them what to do?''
</P>
<P>
   Daalder called the election a ``defeat of the strategy that if
we just pump in enough money and side with one side, then that side
would win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sept. 12-13 vote, deemed fair by independent observers was a
sharp rebuke to Washington and its European allies, who had openly
supported incumbent Bosnian Serb president Biljana Plavsic. Plavsic
is a former hard-liner who moderated her views and talked of unity
in the war-torn country. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had
visited her to show support, and US officials had all but promised
that trade and aid would follow her re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Plavsic acknowledged defeat Monday even before the
final vote tallies had been completed.
</P>
<P>
   Poplasen has rebuffed plans to integrate Serbs, Muslims and
Croats in Bosnia, and has appealed instead to Serbian unity. He is
considered sympathetic to war criminal Radovan Karadzic and has
made no secret of his suspicions of the West.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department now finds itself caught between two
contradictory impulses: recognition of the legitimacy of the
elections and condemnation of Poplasen for his divisiveness and
suggestions that ethnic fighting might resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing more sacred than the preservation of the
integrity of someone's elections,'' said Major General William L.
Nash, visiting lecturer at the Shorenstein Center at Harvard
University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. Nash, who
commanded the first US ground troops in the Bosnia peacekeeping
force, also hopes that Washington will be measured in its responses
to Poplasen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have been a little too public in our intervention in
their election system,'' Nash said. ``I think there was a reaction
to that.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Serbian part of the Bosnian presidential elections was
a setback for the West, analysts saw positive signs in other
results. Zivko Radisic, a moderate, is thought to have defeated a
hardliner in the race for the Serb seat on the three-man collective
presidency. And Plavsic's Unity coalition apparently ousted several
ultra-nationalist incumbents from the Bosnian Serb parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that we're not able to summon the will to do what
we want, to impose a unified state,'' said Jack Seymour, a retired
State Department official who oversaw foreign policy for the former
Yugoslavia. ``We'll have to try to support the moderates, the
people who want to get on with their lives, and try to isolate the
extremists.''
</P>
<P>
   Some specialists who follow Bosnia blamed the West for doing too
little, not too much. Morton Abramowitz, a senior fellow at the
Council on Foreign Relations and an expert in Bosnia, said the
United States and other countries ``dawdled'' on a project to make
elections more fair in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Abramowitz believes that the West cannot retreat from Bosnia
now. Peacekeeping troops will have to stay for years, and the West
must help enact reforms such as laws for determining ownership of
property, he said. Anything less could trigger a new outbreak of
the fighting that raged from 1992 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it's it's going to be costly and it's going to last
a long time but we have no more alternative than persist,'' he
said. But Abramowitz also cautioned against too much pessimism.
``The world hasn't ended,'' he concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Non-governmental groups that have worked with Bosnian refugees
were the most critical of the new political landscape in Bosnia.
``The west didn't do the things it said it would,'' said John Fox,
president of the Open Society Institute, a non-profit democratic
advocacy group in Washington. ``They didn't arrest the big fish war
criminals. They went after the small and middle fry. They took half
measures and they got half results.''

 &HT;    Jocks making records
 &HT;    Photos available
 &HT;    By Bryon Rivers and Paul Lomartire
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   People fantasize about being professional athletes. Others yearn
to play guitar solos or sing self-penned songs in front of a
screaming audience.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are people who don't dream of either lifestyle
because they live both. Surfer Kelly Slater and Major League Soccer
players Alexi Lalas and Alan Prampin are professional athletes and,
on one level or another, career musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Lalas, Slater and Prampin aren't the only jocks-turned-rockers.
L.A. Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal and Deion Sanders of the Dallas
Cowboys have released rap CDs. (For O'Neal, it was ``Shaq Diesel''
and ``Shaq-Fu: Da Return;'' for Sanders, ``Primetime.'')
</P>
<P>
   Add driver Kyle Petty and his song on the NASCAR ``Runnin' Wide
Open'' CD a few years ago and a half-dozen NBA players who
contributed to the 1995 compilation CD ``B-Ball's Best Kept
Secret,'' and you see that jammin' jocks usually serve as novelty
acts, not headline acts.
</P>
<P>
   There are noteworthy exceptions. Mike Reid, a Cincinnati Bengals
All-Pro NFL defensive lineman, is an award-winning Nashville
songwriter and performer. And former Phoenix Suns forward Waymon
Tisdale plays R&AMP;B/jazz well enough to tour with his band, Fifth
Quarter, and have two CDs that sold more than 100,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   Lalas, Slater and Prampin say their celebrity status may have
helped them land record deals, but it didn't lend credibility in
the music world. Jamming jocks, they say, have many skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it as a challenge to win people over,'' says Lalas.
``For it to be good, it has to be very good.''
</P>
<P>
   ALEXI LALAS
</P>
<P>
   Day job: Professional soccer player
</P>
<P>
   Music gig: Songwriter/singer/guitar player with a band that
bears his name.
</P>
<P>
   Alexi Lalas says being a jock-turned-rocker raises a lot of
eyebrows. And the skepticism is often justified.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of cheesy stuff that's come out in the
past, where you've got guys wanting to live a (music) fantasy or
guys using their notoriety to get publicity, and that's
unfortunate,'' says Lalas, 28, a defender for Major League Soccer's
New York/New Jersey MetroStars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I have a challenge ahead of me, and I have to prove to
people that I know what I'm doing. . . . I look at it as a
challenge to win people over.''
</P>
<P>
   With his signature red goatee and endorsement deals, Lalas is
arguably the most recognized soccer player in the United States. As
a child, he lived in Greece and Birmingham, Mich. He listened to
everything from the Beatles and Rolling Stones to Def Leppard and
Bon Jovi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had music as a part of my life and never
considered it a hobby,'' he says. ``Obviously, people know me from
what I've done on the soccer field, but I've always realized I
needed music in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Lalas made two homemade CDs before signing with CMC
International Records, which just released his catchy rock CD,
Ginger. And although the Major League Soccer season _ stretching
from February through October _ leaves little time for music,
Lalas' talents have taken him to the Letterman and Leno shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to concentrate on making simple melodies with
attention to lyrics,'' he says. ``For me, unfortunately, in this
day and age of music, there's a real emphasis on the anti-melody
and the harshness of the song and lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to listen to that. I wanted to make an album
that I would enjoy that I thought people would want to hear,
especially after being bombarded by all this other stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   KELLY SLATER
</P>
<P>
   Day job: Five-time surfing world champion
</P>
<P>
   Music gig: Singer/guitarist with The Surfers
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Slater doesn't like limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people sort of excel at one thing, and they put
their hearts into those things,'' says Slater, a Cocoa Beach
native. ``But I think if someone genuinely has the ability to do a
couple of different things, once people hear that come through, I
think it can work.''
</P>
<P>
   Slater, who appeared on Baywatch as actress Nicole Eggert's
surfer boyfriend, is currently touring with two other pro
surfers/musicians, Peter King and Rob Machado. Their debut CD,
``Songs From the Pipe'' (Epic Records), was released in August.
</P>
<P>
   While Slater is new to the concert scene, King and Machado have
played in touring rock bands. The trio is using a six-week break in
the competitive surfing season to play about a dozen shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``To us, the music thing was just for fun,'' says Slater, 26.
``If it gets to be a major stress, then we're going to have to
change something.''
</P>
<P>
   And Slater is realistic about making music for money. ``The only
way you make any money is if you're in a huge band and you sell
five trillion records,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Slater admits that long drives and killing time before shows
make the pro music circuit tedious compared to surfing. And there
are different pressures. ``A lot of the pressures in music come
from the record label wanting you to do things, whereas most of the
pressure in surfing is whatever you let yourself take on,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   But, in some ways, music and surfing are alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to listen to anyone tell you how to play,'' he
says. ``That's also the beauty of surfing. You can just go ride a
wave how you want to. In both cases, it's unique, and it's your own
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ALAN PRAMPIN
</P>
<P>
   Day job: Professional soccer player
</P>
<P>
   Music gig: Lead singer for the Tampa band If; songwriter,
drummer, guitarist
</P>
<P>
   Alan Prampin remembers growing up in Richardson, Texas: His
father hated driving him to high school band practice but loved
taking him to soccer. And although he was an award-winning drummer
in school and played in his older brother's garage band, The Range,
music finally gave way to soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer led to a scholarship and All-American honors at Southern
Methodist University before he was drafted into the pros.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we grow up, we tend to break away from anything else that's
a distraction to sports,'' says Prampin, now a forward on the Tampa
Bay Mutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of a lucrative ``day job'' is that Prampin can
create music on his own terms.
</P>
<P>
   He recorded his first solo CD, ``Down Escalator,'' this year in
San Francisco with help from his older brother, David, a studio
musician who also works on movie soundtracks. ``Down Escalator'' is
a moody, jazzy collection of six songs that Prampin wrote, played
all the instruments for and sang.
</P>
<P>
   Making it in sports didn't prepare him for the music business,
says Prampin, 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people out there who make it (in music) who
aren't that talented,'' he says. ``In the sports business, you have
to be good to make it. Either you cut it or you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   In the music business, a gimmick can get you in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people always see you as an athlete playing music as
opposed to a musician,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to do a demo tape that he'll combine with his CD to
shop to record companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CD is not the type of music that's radio friendly,'' he
says. ``I'll write a radio-friendly song for the demo. I just think
there's too much crap on the radio right now.''

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know that if President Clinton resigns, or is impeached,
convicted and removed from office, Al Gore becomes president and
Gore would appoint a new vice president to replace himself. If that
happens, and then Gore is impeached, would that vice president
become president? Or would Newt Gingrich become president?
</P>
<P>
   A: In your scenario, the vice president who had been nominated
by President Gore would become president if Gore were impeached and
convicted (or if he died, resigned or left office for any reason).
Then that president would nominate another vice president, who
would be subject to congressional confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   The only way succession would come into play would be if both
the office of president and the office of vice president became
vacant at the same time; for example, if both were assassinated or
resigned. In presidential succession, the following government
officials would be next in line to the presidency, if they are
American-born: speaker of the House; president pro tempore of the
Senate; secretary of state; secretary of the treasury; secretary of
defense; attorney general; and so on down a specified line.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are legal aliens eligible for Social Security benefits?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, but several conditions must be met, said Social Security
Administration spokeswoman Patti Patterson: The person must be
lawfully admitted into the United States; must be authorized to
work; must work under a job that is covered by Social Security; and
must meet all eligibility requirements to receive Social Security
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've heard that Army is now a member of a football league.
What is it, and what other teams are members?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's Conference USA. These are all the teams: Army Cadets,
Cincinnati Bearcats, East Carolina Pirates, Houston Cougars,
Louisville Cardinals, Memphis Tigers, Southern Mississippi Golden
Eagles, Tulane Greenwave. Before this season, Army was an
independent.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What will comprise the Monet exhibit in Boston, and how can
we get tickets?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Monet in the 20th Century,'' at Boston's Museum of Fine
Arts, is made up of more than 80 paintings. The works include
Monet's early views of his gardens at Giverny, France, with a
concentration on the Japanese bridge paintings of 1900; views of
London (1900-1904) and Venice (1908); a partial re-creation of
Monet's water lily exhibition of 1909, featuring more than 20
canvases painted between 1903 and1908; views of the water lily pond
done in Monet's new bold style between 1914 and 1918; later, more
abstract views of the famed weeping willow and Japanese bridge; and
a gathering of the enormous water lily murals painted between 1919
and 1926, some measuring more than 18 feet long.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit, which opened Sunday, closes Dec. 27. Ticket
information: 617-542-4632; general museum information:
617-267-9300. Information also can be viewed at www.mfa.org online.
After leaving Boston, the exhibition will travel to the Royal
Academy of Arts in London, where it will be on view Jan. 21-April
18.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where does the name Caesar salad originate?
</P>
<P>
   A: Imperial Julius doesn't figure into it. Nor does ``Prince''
Mike Romanoff, who popularized the salad at his Hollywood
restaurant decades ago. The salad _ made with romaine lettuce,
garlic-flavored olive oil, lemon juice, grated parmesan cheese,
Worcestershire sauce and garlic-flavored croutons (anchovies
optional) _ is generally credited to Caesar Gardini, who ran
Caesar's Place, a restaurant in Tijuana, Mexico. According to the
story, one day in the early 1920s many more hungry tourists than
expected stopped at his restaurant on their way north from the
bullfights, races, beaches and other Baja California attractions.
So he improvised a salad from the ingredients he had on hand. The
result: Caesar salad. At one time a raw or coddled egg was another
ingredient, added tableside during preparation _ but for safety
reasons, that isn't done anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We frequently see that old photo of the young Bill Clinton
shaking hands with President John F. Kennedy. Has Clinton ever said
if that meeting with Kennedy was what sparked his interest in
politics?
</P>
<P>
   A: Clinton has said that his meeting Kennedy in the White House
Rose Garden, in the summer of 1963, made him want to run for
president. The teen-ager was an Arkansas delegate to Boys Nation, a
Washington conclave sponsored by the American Legion. In
interviews, Clinton still lists that meeting as the most memorable
day of his childhood. ``I never made a secret of the fact that when
I was 16 years old, I decided, if I can do that, that's something
I'd like to do,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But his interest in politics is said to have begun earlier, at
age 9, when he watched the Democratic and Republican nominating
conventions on television. Clinton's first political campaign was
for Congress in 1974, when he was 27. By the time he launched his
first campaign for president, Clinton had been in 17 primary and
general election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I would like to send a letter of support to the president and
his family. What is the address?
</P>
<P>
   A: President Bill Clinton, The White House, 1600 Pennsylvania
Ave., Washington, DC 20500.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have an address for Kenneth Starr? We want to send him
our thanks and appreciation for what he is doing.
</P>
<P>
   A: Kenneth Starr, Office of Independent Counsel, 1001
Pennsylvania Ave. N.W., Suite 490 North, Washington, DC 20001.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Television coverage of the funeral of former Alabama Gov.
George Wallace showed that his casket, as it was being carried into
the Alabama Capitol, was covered with a white cloth with a red X.
What was that about?
</P>
<P>
   A: The casket was draped with the Alabama state flag, which
bears a crimson cross on a white field. The X is enormous,
stretching across all four corners of the flag. World Book
Encyclopedia notes that the cross is suggestive of the Confederate
battle flag.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does the B.C. stand for in the recent Professional
Golfers Association tour event, the B.C. Open in Endicott, N.Y.?
</P>
<P>
   A: Endicott is in Broome County in south-central New York state.
The Broome County Community Charities has sponsored the B.C. Open
since it began _ as the Broome County Open _ in 1971. The event's
name was abbreviated in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who was the first American pilot shot down and captured in
Southeast Asia in the '60s?
</P>
<P>
   A: Several names are sometimes mentioned, but the Dictionary of
the Vietnam War and the Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War agree that
he was Lt. (jg) Everett Alvarez Jr. of San Jose, Calif. He also was
listed as first in a People magazine interview in February 1990 in
connection with a book he co-wrote about the experience, ``Chained
Eagle.'' Piloting an A-4 Skyhawk from the USS Constellation, he was
shot down over North Vietnam on Aug. 5, 1964. Four aircraft taking
part in the air raid, code-named Pierce Arrow, were lost. Alvarez
was transferred to the prison nicknamed Hanoi Hilton and spent the
next eight-plus years as a prisoner of war.
</P>
<P>
   He was among the first group of American POWs granted freedom
after the Paris truce agreement was signed in January 1973. When he
returned home, he was awarded a Silver Star, two Legions of Merit,
two Purple Hearts and several other medals. He continued in a desk
job with the Navy until retirement in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez subsequently earned a law degree from George Washington
University and served as deputy director of the Peace Corps and
deputy administrator of the Veterans Administration (now the
Department of Veteran Affairs). At last report, he was a computer
consultant in Rockville, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are President Clinton's medical records available to the
public?
</P>
<P>
   A: Generally speaking, no. They aren't public documents, said
White House spokeswoman Megan Maloney. They're his own personal
business, just like anybody else's records, she added. However, in
October 1996, before the general election in November, the White
House released Clinton's most recent such records to the media. It
was done as part of a briefing by press secretary Mike McCurry.
Internet sleuths can find it on the White House Web site _
www.whitehouse.gov _ by searching by term or by date (October
1996), Maloney said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you refresh my memory about Victoria Woodhull, who once
ran for the presidency? Also, doesn't the Libertarian Party
frequently put women on its ticket?
</P>
<P>
   A: Victoria Claflin Woodhull (1838-1927) indeed did run for the
presidency, in 1872, as a candidate of the new Equal Rights Party.
Women's voting rights groups admired her stand in favor of allowing
women to vote, but they rejected her candidacy on other issues she
supported, such as the right of women to have love affairs, whether
married or not. She co-founded a newspaper, then used it to promote
communism, free love and legal prostitution. It also was her
platform to expose the sexual shenanigans of a powerful New York
minister, a move that led to her own jailing. In 1870, Woodhull and
her sister, Tennessee Claflin, established the first stock
brokerage firm owned by women, in New York. After divorcing her
second husband, Woodhull fled in 1877 to England, where she married
a British banker and lived until her death in 1927.
</P>
<P>
   No women have run for president on the Libertarian Party ticket,
but two _ Tonie Nathan in 1972 and Jo Jorgensen in 1996 _ have run
for vice president, said Bill Winter of the Libertarians'
Washington headquarters. Winter added that the party doesn't keep
records on women candidates who have run for all offices
nationwide. ``We don't break (candidates) down by age, race or
sex,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have there been any other female presidential candidates
besides Victoria Woodhull?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, quite a few. Here's a sample of those in recent years,
with their party affiliation. 1968: Charlene Mitchell, Communist.
1972: Linda Jenness, Socialist Labor; Shirley Chisholm, Democratic.
1976: Margaret Wright, People's. 1980: Ellen McCormack, Right to
Life; Maureen Smith, Peace and Freedom; Dierdre Griswold, Workers
World. 1984: Sonia Johnson, Citizens. 1988: Lenora Fulani, New
Alliance; Willa Kenoyer, Citizens. 1992: Fulani; Helen Halyard,
Workers League; Isabell Masters, Looking Back; Glorida La Riva,
Workers World. Q: President Andrew Johnson was impeached by the
House of Representatives for firing a Cabinet member. Johnson was
acquitted by one vote. Who was that Cabinet member? What were the
circumstances of his removal? And did he get his job back?
</P>
<P>
   A: Johnson fired Secretary of War Edwin McMasters Stanton on
Aug. 12, 1867, and nominated Gen. Ulysses S. Grant to replace him.
The Tenure of Office Act, passed the previous March, made consent
of the Senate necessary for such removals. Stanton vacated his
office, but under protest.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, at its next reassembling, refused to sanction
Stanton's removal, and Grant at once resigned in his favor. Then
Johnson again removed Stanton and appointed Gen. Lorenzo Thomas to
the office. The Senate declared that the president had exceeded his
authority, and the House passed a resolution, 126-47, that he be
impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors. Votes on conviction
fell just one short of the two-thirds required. Stanton then
resigned and returned to his law practice. He didn't get the
secretary of war position back, in other words.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, Grant succeeded Johnson as president and nominated
Stanton for the Supreme Court. Stanton died on Dec. 24, 1869, four
days after the nomination.

concentration on the Japanese bridge paintings of 1900; views of
London (1900-1904) and Venice (1908); a partial re-creation of
Monet's water lily exhibition of 1909, featuring more than 20
canvases painted between 1903 and1908; views of the water lily pond
done in Monet's new bold style between 1914 and 1918; later, more
abstract views of the famed weeping willow and Japanese bridge; and
a gathering of the enormous water lily murals painted between 1919
and 1926, some measuring more than 18 feet long.

   Q: Where does the name Caesar salad originate?
</P>
<P>
   A: Imperial Julius doesn't figure into it. Nor does ``Prince''
Mike Romanoff, who popularized the salad at his Hollywood
restaurant decades ago. The salad _ made with romaine lettuce,
garlic-flavored olive oil, lemon juice, grated parmesan cheese,
Worcestershire sauce and garlic-flavored croutons (anchovies
optional) _ is generally credited to Caesar Gardini, who ran
Caesar's Place, a restaurant in Tijuana, Mexico. According to the
story, one day in the early 1920s many more hungry tourists than
expected stopped at his restaurant on their way north from the
bullfights, races, beaches and other Baja California attractions.
So he improvised a salad from the ingredients he had on hand. The
result: Caesar salad. At one time a raw or coddled egg was another
ingredient, added tableside during preparation _ but for safety
reasons, that isn't done anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We frequently see that old photo of the young Bill Clinton
shaking hands with President John F. Kennedy. Has Clinton ever said
if that meeting with Kennedy was what sparked his interest in
politics?
</P>
<P>
   A: Clinton has said that his meeting Kennedy in the White House
Rose Garden, in the summer of 1963, made him want to run for
president. The teen-ager was an Arkansas delegate to Boys Nation, a
Washington conclave sponsored by the American Legion. In
interviews, Clinton still lists that meeting as the most memorable
day of his childhood. ``I never made a secret of the fact that when
I was 16 years old, I decided, if I can do that, that's something
I'd like to do,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But his interest in politics is said to have begun earlier, at
age 9, when he watched the Democratic and Republican nominating
conventions on television. Clinton's first political campaign was
for Congress in 1974, when he was 27. By the time he launched his
first campaign for president, Clinton had been in 17 primary and
general election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I would like to send a letter of support to the president and
his family. What is the address?
</P>
<P>
   A: President Bill Clinton, The White House, 1600 Pennsylvania
Ave., Washington, DC 20500.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have an address for Kenneth Starr? We want to send him
our thanks and appreciation for what he is doing.
</P>
<P>
   A: Kenneth Starr, Office of Independent Counsel, 1001
Pennsylvania Ave. N.W., Suite 490 North, Washington, DC 20001.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Television coverage of the funeral of former Alabama Gov.
George Wallace showed that his casket, as it was being carried into
the Alabama Capitol, was covered with a white cloth with a red X.
What was that about?
</P>
<P>
   A: The casket was draped with the Alabama state flag, which
bears a crimson cross on a white field. The X is enormous,
stretching across all four corners of the flag. World Book
Encyclopedia notes that the cross is suggestive of the Confederate
battle flag.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does the B.C. stand for in the recent Professional
Golfers Association tour event, the B.C. Open in Endicott, N.Y.?
</P>
<P>
   A: Endicott is in Broome County in south-central New York state.
The Broome County Community Charities has sponsored the B.C. Open
since it began _ as the Broome County Open _ in 1971. The event's
name was abbreviated in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who was the first American pilot shot down and captured in
Southeast Asia in the '60s?
</P>
<P>
   A: Several names are sometimes mentioned, but the Dictionary of
the Vietnam War and the Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War agree that
he was Lt. (jg) Everett Alvarez Jr. of San Jose, Calif. He also was
listed as first in a People magazine interview in February 1990 in
connection with a book he co-wrote about the experience, ``Chained
Eagle.'' Piloting an A-4 Skyhawk from the USS Constellation, he was
shot down over North Vietnam on Aug. 5, 1964. Four aircraft taking
part in the air raid, code-named Pierce Arrow, were lost. Alvarez
was transferred to the prison nicknamed Hanoi Hilton and spent the
next eight-plus years as a prisoner of war.
</P>
<P>
   He was among the first group of American POWs granted freedom
after the Paris truce agreement was signed in January 1973. When he
returned home, he was awarded a Silver Star, two Legions of Merit,
two Purple Hearts and several other medals. He continued in a desk
job with the Navy until retirement in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez subsequently earned a law degree from George Washington
University and served as deputy director of the Peace Corps and
deputy administrator of the Veterans Administration (now the
Department of Veteran Affairs). At last report, he was a computer
consultant in Rockville, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are President Clinton's medical records available to the
public?
</P>
<P>
   A: Generally speaking, no. They aren't public documents, said
White House spokeswoman Megan Maloney. They're his own personal
business, just like anybody else's records, she added. However, in
October 1996, before the general election in November, the White
House released Clinton's most recent such records to the media. It
was done as part of a briefing by press secretary Mike McCurry.
Internet sleuths can find it on the White House Web site _
www.whitehouse.gov _ by searching by term or by date (October
1996), Maloney said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you refresh my memory about Victoria Woodhull, who once
ran for the presidency? Also, doesn't the Libertarian Party
frequently put women on its ticket?
</P>
<P>
   A: Victoria Claflin Woodhull (1838-1927) indeed did run for the
presidency, in 1872, as a candidate of the new Equal Rights Party.
Women's voting rights groups admired her stand in favor of allowing
women to vote, but they rejected her candidacy on other issues she
supported, such as the right of women to have love affairs, whether
married or not. She co-founded a newspaper, then used it to promote
communism, free love and legal prostitution. It also was her
platform to expose the sexual shenanigans of a powerful New York
minister, a move that led to her own jailing. In 1870, Woodhull and
her sister, Tennessee Claflin, established the first stock
brokerage firm owned by women, in New York. After divorcing her
second husband, Woodhull fled in 1877 to England, where she married
a British banker and lived until her death in 1927.
</P>
<P>
   No women have run for president on the Libertarian Party ticket,
but two _ Tonie Nathan in 1972 and Jo Jorgensen in 1996 _ have run
for vice president, said Bill Winter of the Libertarians'
Washington headquarters. Winter added that the party doesn't keep
records on women candidates who have run for all offices
nationwide. ``We don't break (candidates) down by age, race or
sex,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have there been any other female presidential candidates
besides Victoria Woodhull?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, quite a few. Here's a sample of those in recent years,
with their party affiliation. 1968: Charlene Mitchell, Communist.
1972: Linda Jenness, Socialist Labor; Shirley Chisholm, Democratic.
1976: Margaret Wright, People's. 1980: Ellen McCormack, Right to
Life; Maureen Smith, Peace and Freedom; Dierdre Griswold, Workers
World. 1984: Sonia Johnson, Citizens. 1988: Lenora Fulani, New
Alliance; Willa Kenoyer, Citizens. 1992: Fulani; Helen Halyard,
Workers League; Isabell Masters, Looking Back; Glorida La Riva,
Workers World. Q: President Andrew Johnson was impeached by the
House of Representatives for firing a Cabinet member. Johnson was
acquitted by one vote. Who was that Cabinet member? What were the
circumstances of his removal? And did he get his job back?
</P>
<P>
   A: Johnson fired Secretary of War Edwin McMasters Stanton on
Aug. 12, 1867, and nominated Gen. Ulysses S. Grant to replace him.
The Tenure of Office Act, passed the previous March, made consent
of the Senate necessary for such removals. Stanton vacated his
office, but under protest.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, at its next reassembling, refused to sanction
Stanton's removal, and Grant at once resigned in his favor. Then
Johnson again removed Stanton and appointed Gen. Lorenzo Thomas to
the office. The Senate declared that the president had exceeded his
authority, and the House passed a resolution, 126-47, that he be
impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors. Votes on conviction
fell just one short of the two-thirds required. Stanton then
resigned and returned to his law practice. He didn't get the
secretary of war position back, in other words.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, Grant succeeded Johnson as president and nominated
Stanton for the Supreme Court. Stanton died on Dec. 24, 1869, four
days after the nomination.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Q: President Andrew Johnson was impeached by the House
of Representatives for firing a Cabinet member. Johnson was
acquitted by one vote. Who was that Cabinet member? What were the
circumstances of his removal? And did he get his job back?
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is meant by the term ``the Beltway''? I heard it
referred to by a commentator in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A: The Capital Beltway is Washington's Perimeter, I-495, which
cuts through the Virginia and Maryland suburbs. In England, ``ring
road'' is the term for the same thing. Think of a belt around one's
waist, and you have the idea.
</P>
<P>
   But the meaning here is not so literal. In referring to
Washington matters, ``inside the Beltway'' refers to the pols and
others with a government-centered mentality, and the business they
do; ``outside the Beltway'' refers to all the rest of
nongovernment-centered America.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does President Clinton actually own a house anywhere? Does he
even own a car?
</P>
<P>
   A: Neither the president nor first lady owns a house, according
to a White House spokeswoman. Clinton does, however, own a car, a
'66 Mustang convertible which he purchased in 1991 from his
half-brother, Roger Clinton. When Clinton left Arkansas for the
White House, the car _ painted a 1960s metallic shade of blue _
stayed behind in Little Rock. It subsequently was put on display at
the Museum of Automobiles atop Petit Jean Mountain in Morrilton,
Ark. Clinton has said that he planned to retrieve the car from the
museum at the end of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm interested in the prayer that President Clinton read when
he was addressing ministers last Friday at a prayer breakfast in
Washington. It was beautiful. Can you print it?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was a passage from a Yom Kippur liturgy contained in the
liturgy book ''Gates of Repentance,'' which Clinton said was given
to him recently by a Jewish friend. This is what he read:
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the time for turning. The leaves are beginning to turn
from green to red to orange. The birds are beginning to turn and
are heading once more toward the south. The animals are beginning
to turn to storing their food for the winter. For leaves, birds and
animals, turning comes instinctively.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for us, turning does not come so easily. It takes an act
of will for us to make a turn. It means breaking old habits. It
means admitting that we have been wrong, and this is never easy. It
means losing face. It means starting all over again. And this is
always painful. It means saying I am sorry. It means recognizing
that we have the ability to change. These things are terribly hard
to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``But unless we turn, we will be trapped forever in yesterday's
ways. Lord help us to turn from callousness to sensitivity, from
hostility to love, from pettiness to purpose, from envy to
contentment, from carelessness to discipline, from fear to faith.
Turn us around, oh, Lord, and bring us back toward you. Revive our
lives as at the beginning. And turn us toward each other, Lord, for
in isolation, there is no life.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: More than 65 percent of the American public has indicated
through numerous polls that we do not want impeachment proceedings
against President Clinton. If Congress decides to act contrary to
the wish of the people, is there any procedure by which the people
(apart from their elected representatives) can take formal steps to
petition and direct the Congress to comply with the wish of the
people?
</P>
<P>
   A: Other than voting against your representative at the next
election if he or she doesn't act in accordance with your wishes,
there's no formal means for voters to ``order'' Congress to do
anything. But Emmett H. Buell, professor of political science at
Denison University in Granville, Ohio, says there's a ``mistakenly
static frame of mind'' inherent in the question. Polls may change,
and public support for Clinton may erode, as inquiries progress.
There was a time, for example, when most Americans didn't think
President Richard Nixon should be forced from office, Buell said,
but as evidence steadily mounted that he had lied and abused his
power, his support eventually eroded in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Buell also pointed out that a majority isn't always right,
especially if it has limited information on which to base its
judgment. Members of the House of Representatives have more
information than private citizens do, he said, adding: ``They're
making a good deal of it available to us, however, and more
information may indeed change the public's mind. But in any case,
the idea that a partially informed majority is always right, as
reflected in a simple poll question, is not what the Founding
Fathers intended for this system, and is not the best means of
making important decisions like the one facing the country today.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was the date when Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) first called for
impeachment of President Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   A: Barr wrote a letter in March 1997 to Rep. Henry Hyde
(R-Ill.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, asking Hyde to
consider beginning an impeachment inquiry of Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore. An article in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution
on March 15, 1997, reporting Barr's request, quoted Rep. John
Conyers of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the committee, as
saying most members of Congress would reject Barr's call. ``His
activity is on the political margins and won't be taken
seriously.'' Barr responded to that by saying, ``I haven't taken a
cheap shot. It is a very measured request. I have not asked for
articles of impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will you print the exact text of the U.S. president's oath of
office? Where is the wording stipulated?
</P>
<P>
   A: Article II, Section 1, clause 8 of the Constitution sets out
the words that every president has restated at inauguration
(capitalization as in the Constitution): ``I do solemnly swear (or
affirm) that I will faithfully executive the Office of President of
the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve,
protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The oath is the only part of the inaugural ceremony required by
the Constitution. Only Franklin Pierce in 1853 affirmed, rather
than swore, to faithfully execute the office that he was about to
enter. The practice of adding the words ``so help me God'' at the
conclusion of the oath was begun by George Washington at the first
inaugural ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What would President Clinton's pension be if he resigns? What
if he is impeached? Would he still be eligible for other perks, and
in what amount?
</P>
<P>
   A: If he resigns, Clinton will be eligible for a pension of
$151,800 a year, said Pete Sepp of the National Taxpayers Union.
Under the Former President's Act of 1958, he is entitled to that
pension only if he is not impeached. He can resign, he can stick it
out to the end of his term, and he even can be convicted outside
the impeachment process _ such as in a criminal case or civil suit
after he leaves office _ but if he is impeached and convicted by
Congress, he forfeits the pension as well as his office allowances.
Those allowances can be as much as $650,000 a year, Sepp said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have been impressed by the insights in the national media
from George Stephanopoulos. Will you refresh my memory about the
circumstances surrounding his departure from the White House? What
was the official explanation?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was in December 1996 that Stephanopoulos, after five years
on President Clinton's White House team _ first as communications
director and later as senior adviser _ accepted a visiting
professorship at Columbia University, teaching a subject he knows
well: political science. He also announced his intention to join
ABC News as a contributing correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews in 1996, Stephanopoulos said this about his career
change: ``It just felt perfect. . . . I love New York. Columbia's
not only a top-ranked university, it's my alma mater.'' (He
graduated in 1982 with a bachelor's degree in political science,
summa cum laude, before going on to earn a master's in theology as
a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford).
</P>
<P>
   He admitted that it would be ``very hard'' to leave the White
House, adding, ``I'm going to miss him (Clinton) and it's tough to
leave the excitement of the White House. But it's time.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was a list of the victims aboard Swissair Flight 111 ever
released?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can find the names (passengers and crew) on the Internet:
www.cnn.com/WORLD/americas/9809/04/victim.list.01/
</P>
<P>
   Q: Mark McGwire has been taking some type of muscle stimulant
medication. Is Sammy Sosa also taking this?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's been widely reported that McGwire has been using
Androstenedione _ legal in baseball, but banned in the NFL,
Olympics and NCAA _ for more than a year. The over-the-counter drug
raises levels of the male hormone testosterone, which builds lean
muscle mass and promotes recovery after injury. Sosa says he
doesn't use Androstenedione or any other testosterone booster, but
admits to using the muscle-builder Creatine, an amino-acid powder,
after games to keep up his weight and strength. For energy before
games, Sosa says he takes the Chinese herb ginseng. McGwire also
says he takes Creatine.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does the violinist Midori have any other name? When did she
start playing?
</P>
<P>
   A: Midori hasn't used her last name, Goto, professionally since
1986. She was born Oct. 25, 1971, in Osaka, Japan. Her father was
an engineer and her mother, Setsu Goto, a professional violinist.
Her mother began teaching her to play when she was 3, and when she
was 6, Midori gave her first public recital. She made her U.S.
debut at the 1981 Aspen Music Festival in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A newspaper column listed presidents who were involved or
rumored to have been involved in affairs before or during marriage.
George Bush was mentioned in connection with a Jennifer Fitzgerald.
Where did that information come from? I've never heard or read
about that.
</P>
<P>
   A: The list in the column you saw was compiled by the Fort Worth
(Texas) Star-Telegram. But long-whispered rumors about the
relationship have circulated, mainly outside the mainstream press,
for some time. The rumors were never substantiated, despite
investigations by a number of news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret that Fitzgerald worked closely with Bush when he
was ambassador to China in 1974, and, in 1975, she was his personal
assistant at the CIA. She did the same job for Bush when he became
vice president. As president, he made her deputy chief of protocol.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, that doesn't mean there was any untoward relationship.
But rumors nevertheless cropped up. For example, at the end of the
1988 presidential campaign, the Los Angeles Weekly, an alternative
newspaper, printed an old tale that she had been Bush's mistress.
In a recap two years later, the Independent of London wrote: ``Wall
Street prices briefly plunged for fear that mainstream newspapers
would pick up the story, destroy Mr. Bush's image as a family man
and dissolve his commanding lead. . . . The story was reprinted
abroad but ignored by the U.S. news media.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the tabloid New York Post printed an article based on
the book ``The Power House'' by Susan B. Trento, a former
congressional aide. Asked about the newspaper report, Bush said,
``I will not respond to it. I have not responded to it in the
past.'' He then continued, ``Except to say it's a lie.'' Mary
Matalin, the Bush campaign's political director, blamed Democrats
for peddling the story.

reflected in a simple poll question, is not what the Founding
Fathers intended for this system, and is not the best means of
making important decisions like the one facing the country today.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was the date when Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) first called for
impeachment of President Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   A: Barr wrote a letter in March 1997 to Rep. Henry Hyde
(R-Ill.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, asking Hyde to
consider beginning an impeachment inquiry of Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore. An article in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution
on March 15, 1997, reporting Barr's request, quoted Rep. John
Conyers of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the committee, as
saying most members of Congress would reject Barr's call. ``His
activity is on the political margins and won't be taken
seriously.'' Barr responded to that by saying, ``I haven't taken a
cheap shot. It is a very measured request. I have not asked for
articles of impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will you print the exact text of the U.S. president's oath of
office? Where is the wording stipulated?
</P>
<P>
   A: Article II, Section 1, clause 8 of the Constitution sets out
the words that every president has restated at inauguration
(capitalization as in the Constitution): ``I do solemnly swear (or
affirm) that I will faithfully executive the Office of President of
the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve,
protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The oath is the only part of the inaugural ceremony required by
the Constitution. Only Franklin Pierce in 1853 affirmed, rather
than swore, to faithfully execute the office that he was about to
enter. The practice of adding the words ``so help me God'' at the
conclusion of the oath was begun by George Washington at the first
inaugural ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What would President Clinton's pension be if he resigns? What
if he is impeached? Would he still be eligible for other perks, and
in what amount?
</P>
<P>
   A: If he resigns, Clinton will be eligible for a pension of
$151,800 a year, said Pete Sepp of the National Taxpayers Union.
Under the Former President's Act of 1958, he is entitled to that
pension only if he is not impeached. He can resign, he can stick it
out to the end of his term, and he even can be convicted outside
the impeachment process _ such as in a criminal case or civil suit
after he leaves office _ but if he is impeached and convicted by
Congress, he forfeits the pension as well as his office allowances.
Those allowances can be as much as $650,000 a year, Sepp said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have been impressed by the insights in the national media
from George Stephanopoulos. Will you refresh my memory about the
circumstances surrounding his departure from the White House? What
was the official explanation?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was in December 1996 that Stephanopoulos, after five years
on President Clinton's White House team _ first as communications
director and later as senior adviser _ accepted a visiting
professorship at Columbia University, teaching a subject he knows
well: political science. He also announced his intention to join
ABC News as a contributing correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews in 1996, Stephanopoulos said this about his career
change: ``It just felt perfect. . . . I love New York. Columbia's
not only a top-ranked university, it's my alma mater.'' (He
graduated in 1982 with a bachelor's degree in political science,
summa cum laude, before going on to earn a master's in theology as
a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford).
</P>
<P>
   He admitted that it would be ``very hard'' to leave the White
House, adding, ``I'm going to miss him (Clinton) and it's tough to
leave the excitement of the White House. But it's time.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was a list of the victims aboard Swissair Flight 111 ever
released?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can find the names (passengers and crew) on the Internet:
www.cnn.com/WORLD/americas/9809/04/victim.list.01/
</P>
<P>
   Q: Mark McGwire has been taking some type of muscle stimulant
medication. Is Sammy Sosa also taking this?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's been widely reported that McGwire has been using
Androstenedione _ legal in baseball, but banned in the NFL,
Olympics and NCAA _ for more than a year. The over-the-counter drug
raises levels of the male hormone testosterone, which builds lean
muscle mass and promotes recovery after injury. Sosa says he
doesn't use Androstenedione or any other testosterone booster, but
admits to using the muscle-builder Creatine, an amino-acid powder,
after games to keep up his weight and strength. For energy before
games, Sosa says he takes the Chinese herb ginseng. McGwire also
says he takes Creatine.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does the violinist Midori have any other name? When did she
start playing?
</P>
<P>
   A: Midori hasn't used her last name, Goto, professionally since
1986. She was born Oct. 25, 1971, in Osaka, Japan. Her father was
an engineer and her mother, Setsu Goto, a professional violinist.
Her mother began teaching her to play when she was 3, and when she
was 6, Midori gave her first public recital. She made her U.S.
debut at the 1981 Aspen Music Festival in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A newspaper column listed presidents who were involved or
rumored to have been involved in affairs before or during marriage.
George Bush was mentioned in connection with a Jennifer Fitzgerald.
Where did that information come from? I've never heard or read
about that.
</P>
<P>
   A: The list in the column you saw was compiled by the Fort Worth
(Texas) Star-Telegram. But long-whispered rumors about the
relationship have circulated, mainly outside the mainstream press,
for some time. The rumors were never substantiated, despite
investigations by a number of news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret that Fitzgerald worked closely with Bush when he
was ambassador to China in 1974, and, in 1975, she was his personal
assistant at the CIA. She did the same job for Bush when he became
vice president. As president, he made her deputy chief of protocol.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, that doesn't mean there was any untoward relationship.
But rumors nevertheless cropped up. For example, at the end of the
1988 presidential campaign, the Los Angeles Weekly, an alternative
newspaper, printed an old tale that she had been Bush's mistress.
In a recap two years later, the Independent of London wrote: ``Wall
Street prices briefly plunged for fear that mainstream newspapers
would pick up the story, destroy Mr. Bush's image as a family man
and dissolve his commanding lead. . . . The story was reprinted
abroad but ignored by the U.S. news media.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the tabloid New York Post printed an article based on
the book ``The Power House'' by Susan B. Trento, a former
congressional aide. Asked about the newspaper report, Bush said,
``I will not respond to it. I have not responded to it in the
past.'' He then continued, ``Except to say it's a lie.'' Mary
Matalin, the Bush campaign's political director, blamed Democrats
for peddling the story.

 &HT;    Lawmaker, insurers in records fight
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A state lawmaker is weighing in to a fight over
the availability and use of insurance reports that he says could
prove insurers are illegally denying coverage to Texans in poor and
minority-dominated areas.
</P>
<P>
   Although a court has ruled that the reports are not public
information, state Rep. Lon Burnam, D-Fort Worth, is seeking the
information under an exception allowed for lawmakers. He must sign
a confidentiality agreement with the Texas Department of Insurance,
which compiled the report, to get the information. But he needs
help analyzing the data. For that, he has turned to a former TDI
employee who now works for a consumer group.
</P>
<P>
   That has some insurers worried.
</P>
<P>
   Burnam said he wants the information _ which shows where
insurers write auto and homeowners' policies _ to investigate for
himself whether Texas insurers are illegally denying coverage
because of a person's race, ethnicity or neighborhood. The practice
is known as redlining.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, I feel that TDI has failed to pursue the
consumers' interest to the same degree that it pursues the
insurers' interest,'' said Burnam, a member of the House Insurance
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Industry spokesman Jerry Johns, president of the Southwestern
Insurance Information Service, said he's concerned for
policyholders if the data is leaked to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``This type of information is considered highly sensitive in
terms of competition in the marketplace,'' Johns said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Insurance Commissioner Elton Bomer said his
department has taken numerous steps to make clear that redlining
will not be tolerated. Those steps include specific redlining
investigations of seven companies in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to take action against a major company within a few
days for alleged violations found in one of these examinations,''
Bomer said.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers earlier this year were granted a court order preventing
the information Burnam is requesting from being made public.
Industry attorneys argued that the reports could reveal companies'
marketing strategies to their competitors.
</P>
<P>
   But Burnam and Birny Birnbaum, a former TDI executive and now an
insurance data analyst for the Center for Economic Justice, said
the information likely shows that insurers systematically avoid
poor and minority-dominated areas of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Burnam said he enlisted Birnbaum's help in seeking the
information and has planned to hire the former department official
to analyze the data. He said there are few people who do that type
of analysis, and most are aligned either with the industry or the
state regulatory agency.
</P>
<P>
   Birnbaum is a strong critic of the insurance department and the
industry. He led the effort to get the reports made public and has
conducted other redlining investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many people focused on the personality and not
on my legitimate right to have adequate information to make a
proper decision,'' Burnam said. ``I have to have someone who can
analyze the data.''
</P>
<P>
   Birnbaum said he did not initiate Burnam's interest in the issue
and is not attempting an end-run around the court's order that the
information not be publicly disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like there aren't that many people who aren't
associated with the insurance industry who are knowledgeable and
available to analyze the data,'' Birnbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see anything really sinister about it,'' he said of
his involvement in gathering and reviewing the information.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Conway, an attorney for State Farm Insurance Cos., said
her clients have never been concerned about Birnbaum or other
consumer advocates getting hold of the data.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that this information shows redlining,'' she
said. ``I don't believe it could be used properly to show
redlining.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the issue is one of protecting competitive information.
</P>
<P>
   Under the court order and state law, lawmakers, their staff and
anyone who sees or has access to the companies' reports must sign
confidentiality agreements. The order also requires the information
be accessed and used for ``legislative purposes only.'' Birnbaum
said he is prepared to sign such a form if required to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Conway nor Paul Berry, a spokesman for USAA Insurance,
which was involved in the court fight, would discuss Birnbaum's
involvement in Burnam's request for the data.
</P>
<P>
   But Johns, the industry group spokesman, said that ``sharing
this type of information would be much like Texaco sharing their
worldwide marketing plan with Exxon. Consumers suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   In previous legislative sessions, lawmakers have considered
allegations of insurance redlining. Industry officials have said
that if companies are acting illegally, the insurance department
has the information and power to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   TDI spokesman Jim Davis said it takes a great deal of work to
prove a company is redlining.
</P>
<P>
   Agency spokesman Lee Jones added that the department has taken
action to address symptoms of redlining. He also said that
something can look like redlining without actually being redlining.
For example, Jones said, a company's market report might show few
policies in a low-income area, but marketing information shows the
company actively promoting policies in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have proof to take action,'' he said.

 &HT;    Climbing Dorsett's Peak
 &HT;    By Mark Wangrin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Tony Dorsett always was tough to catch from
behind _ he still holds the NFL record for longest run from
scrimmage, a 99-yarder against Minnesota in 1983 _ but not all his
records are as unbreakable as that one.
</P>
<P>
   But they're close.
</P>
<P>
   With eight games left, Texas halfback Ricky Williams is faced
with beginning an all-out sprint _ or risk falling short of
Dorsett's NCAA career rushing record of 6,082 yards, set when the
former Cowboy was at the University of Pittsburgh from 1973-76.
</P>
<P>
   After being held to only 43 yards against Kansas State recently,
Williams must now average at least 189 yards over the final eight
games of the season to pass Dorsett. He is 18th, 1,509 yards behind
Dorsett but within a repeat of last season's 249-yard effort
against Rice of passing Heisman Trophy winners Marcus Allen and
Mike Rozier and moving into the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's performance against the Owls started Williams on a
magnificent streak, in which he ran for 200 or more yards in six of
eight games.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot, 220-pound senior could get on a similar roll
starting with an upcoming rematch with the Owls, who are missing
three injured starters on defense and have allowed 171.3 yards a
game against three schools (Southern Methodist, Purdue and
Northwestern) not known for their running attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other factors to consider as Williams mounts his
record assault:
</P>
<P>
   Inflated statistics. It's hard to tell if Williams will truly
face top 50 rush defenses in each of his last six games _ Oklahoma,
Baylor, Nebraska, Oklahoma State, Texas Tech and Texas A&AMP;M _ or if
the numbers are influenced by those teams playing weak competition.
</P>
<P>
   Weak? Dotting the schedules of those six teams are North Texas,
Northern Illinois, Fresno State, Cal and Southern Mississippi _
none of which rank higher than 95th (out of 112) in rush offense
and whose combined average is 2.1 yards a carry.
</P>
<P>
   Those six teams combined have also only faced four rushers in
the current NCAA top 50 (Basil Mitchell, TCU (twice); James
Johnson, Mississippi State; Travis Minor, Florida State; and Ken
Simonton, Oregon State). Need more of a silver lining? Last season
Williams ran for at least 150 yards on three of them.
</P>
<P>
   Opportunistic play by Major Applewhite and, when he comes back,
Richard Walton at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Success breeds imitation, so more teams will stack the line and
try to be more aggressive with their linebackers to have the
success Kansas State did. That means more big plays from receivers
Kwame Cavil and Wane McGarity and more production from tight end
Derek Lewis, who will frequently find himself open against such
schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Help from the defense, though so far this season he hasn't
gotten much.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns' defense has held its opponent without a first
down on only eight of the opponents' 35 possessions _ and six of
those came after Texas already had been down by at least four
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   That has to improve markedly to get Williams more possessions
and more carries, but one area where the Horns are improved is in
forcing turnovers. In three games Texas has forced two
interceptions and four fumbles, averaging twice as many per game as
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   One bittersweet blessing is that the Horns' struggling defense
should prevent any blowouts by UT, which could keep Williams in the
game longer. On the other hand, poor early play by the defense
could get the Horns blown out _ knocking him out of games earlier,
too.
</P>
<P>
   A miracle. Should the Longhorns somehow win the Big 12 South
title, they'll play in the conference championship game on Dec. 5
in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Good news: Those statistics will count toward Williams'
regular-season total.
</P>
<P>
   Bad news: That'll mean a rematch with Kansas State or Nebraska,
against which he has a 1.5 career yards-per-carry average.
</P>
<P>
   Opportunity missed. Texas had an invitation to play Louisiana
Tech in the Eddie Robinson Classic. Bowl games don't count toward
Dorsett's record, but a 12th regular-season game would. The Horns
showed no interest, and Nebraska took the chance, only to be ripped
apart by the Bulldogs' NCAA record-setting combination of Tim
Rattay and Troy Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' young defense would likely have been destroyed by the
Bulldogs, but Williams would have faced a rush defense that's
giving up 193.3 yards a game. Enticing, but there was still too
much to lose.

 &HT;    So who's the half-baked Alaska?
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Like y'all, I'm flat sick of hearing about
Monica Lewinsky. So today I'm fixing to tell you about Perry A., a
South Austin author who does dessert readings.
</P>
<P>
   The reason I picked this subject is that it would be impossible,
even for a smart aleck such as myself, to tie it into the White
House scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how a dessert reading works. Perry A., whose real last
name is Arledge, asks you, ``If you were a dessert, what would you
be?''Then, you tell her you're a cookie, a tart, a cheesecake or
whatever. Based on your selection, Perry A. analyzes your
personality _ the theory being that you and the dessert you claim
to be have similar traits.
</P>
<P>
   So OK, I give up. What kind of dessert is Monica Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Monica is a pudding person,'' said Perry A., who has
written a book about dessert personality interpretations called
``People . . . Are Just Desserts. Experience the Sweet Rewards!''
``She's very adaptable and moldable. Goes with the flow. . . Very
compassionate and caring. Likes to make people feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't touch that line with a potholder.
</P>
<P>
   So if everybody is a dessert, what kind is the First Lady?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can see her as a baked Alaska,'' Perry A. said.
``You just wonder what's inside under the fluff.'' The way things
are going these days at the White House, I suspect what's under the
fluff is a rolling pin.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any money in these dessert readings? Nah. Perry A. had
intended to give dessert readings for $5 a pop last weekend at the
Whole Life Expo at Palmer Auditorium. But she ended up doing them
free, since even the New Age space cadets who attended the show
wouldn't know a dessert reading from an aura fluffing.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder. This is new ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm the only person in the world who has clicked onto
this,'' Perry A. said. ``I may be the world's only dessert
analyst.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry A.'s book divides the human ``Dessert Cart'' into eight
categories, including Cake People, Cookie People and Pie People. So
let's say you wake up one morning and discover, ``I am a pie.''
Other than that you are obviously a couple of quacks short of a
full duck, what does this mean?
</P>
<P>
   ``The pie people are very organized, usually,'' said Perry A.,
who suspects Kenneth Starr is a pineapple. ``Look at the pecan pie.
They have all the little pecans in a row. These people have all
their socks color-coordinated in a drawer.''
</P>
<P>
   Me? I'm ice cream. So what's my story? ``Ice cream tells me
you're a bit of an analyzer,'' Perry A. said. ``It comes frozen.
The big chill. When you step into something new, you kinda fade
back, blend into the wallpaper and become the silent observer,
listener, gathering information.''
</P>
<P>
   All this, and I didn't even tell her what kind of nuts.
</P>
<P>
   So what sort of dessert is the president? ``Right now I think
he's a chocolate-covered strawberry,'' Perry A. said. ``A bit of a
tease, only lets a little of the red show. He was trying not to let
a lot of this part of his life show.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, well, he's just lucky he didn't get his strawberry caught
in his zipper.

 &HT;    PAX TV: Poor Nielsen ratings based on bad data
 &HT;    By Marguerite M. Plunkett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first national Nielsen television ratings for PAX TV came in
at less than half the network's estimates, with all its new and
rerun prime-time shows rating at the bottom of the 122-program
national list.
</P>
<P>
   Paxson Communications, however, says the numbers don't include
all the households it reaches.
</P>
<P>
   PAX drew an average 0.5 rating for its prime-time programming
for the week of Sept. 14-20, according to Nielsen Media Research.
</P>
<P>
   The number means that half of 1 percent of U.S. homes with TV
sets _ or 529,000 households _ tuned in to the new network.
</P>
<P>
   But West Palm Beach, Fla.-based Paxson (AMEX: PAX, $9.75), which
has been estimating a 1 to 1.2 average national rating for prime
time, said Nielsen's numbers were incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   The national survey did not count all the areas PAX is serving,
according to Rob Hebenstreit, Paxson vice president of research.
Nielsen's numbers were preliminary and released before Paxson had
verified them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hebenstreit said he had a Nielsen letter in hand that
acknowledged the ratings did not reflect PAX's full coverage. He
would not release the letter, however.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, he said, cited one example of 40 cable systems that
had not been counted in the Nielsen ratings.
</P>
<P>
   However, Nielsen spokeswoman Anne Elliot said she was not aware
of a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen did not release national numbers for Paxson before this
week because it had difficulty determining where PAX TV was airing,
and when.
</P>
<P>
   Hebenstreit said Paxson wanted the figures released for its
clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hoping that Nielsen's systems were in place,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen measures all networks nightly and weekly, drawing
information from two different groups of metered television sets
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen has been providing overnight ratings of PAX since the
family-oriented network debuted Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   PAX drew a 2.4 overnight rating in the West Palm Beach market

 &HT;    Washington's manufactured crisis far cry from London
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The week of Sept. 14-20 turned out to be a good week to be out
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, ``it'' was all over the news in England, too, but I tuned
out, on vacation from the Clinton scandal as much as anything.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, it was in the Cabinet War Rooms in London _ where
Winston Churchill and his Cabinet bunkered throughout most of World
War II _ that I couldn't stop thinking about our national soap
opera.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, Churchill's old radio addresses were
broadcast in an exhibit room:
</P>
<P>
   ``We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall
fight on the seas and the ocean, we shall fight with growing
confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our
island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we
shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields
and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills, we shall never
surrender.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, these magnificent words _ from a great statesman,
facing a real crisis _ made me think of the manufactured crisis in
Washington and our weakened, foolish leader.
</P>
<P>
   I left London with words like these ringing in my ears: ``Never
in the course of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so
few.''
</P>
<P>
   I came home to ``Why do you think oral sex performed on you does
not fall under the definition of sexual relations?'' and a scene in
the capital more reminiscent of a Monty Python skit than a
political process. (With delicious irony, Channel 2 cut away from
The Jerry Springer Show to air Clinton's testimony.)
</P>
<P>
   None of us wants our national mettle tested by war or hardship.
But why is prosperity bringing out the very worst of the political
beast? This week brings us the Clinton Sex Scandal: The Video, in
which the president ponders the definition of such complex terms as
``alone'' and ``is.''
</P>
<P>
   It borders on theater of the absurd. As if with collective voice
the American people cry, ``Enough!'' The response from Congress and
the press? ``More!'' As my old buddy Winston Churchill might have
said, ``Never in the course of human conflict was so much made over
so little by so many.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it just coincidence this country hasn't had a truly great
orator since Martin Luther King Jr.? Or is the deterioration of the
language of politics symbolic of the deterioration of our political
discourse?
</P>
<P>
   It's not just Clinton's character, or lack thereof, writ large
in this sea of sleaze. Consider the choices we're stuck with: a
president who is trying to tell us we've been wrong all along about
our definition of sex (where's Dr. Ruth when you need her?) and a
Congress that would have us believe they're motivated by high moral
standards and constitutional principle. The release of the tape
makes it glaringly evident what this has been about all along:
``Bury the American people in garbage until they think what we want
them to think.''
</P>
<P>
   With Gallup polls Tuesday showing the president's approval rates
going up to 66 percent, the public stubbornly refuses to cooperate.
Maybe the public understands _ better than their elected officials
_ that lies told under oath aren't the only ones that matter.

 &HT;    De Niro dons new intensity in film
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert De Niro trades method acting for action in Ronin, an
old-school spy thriller from veteran director John Frankenheimer.
</P>
<P>
   As a shadowy covert operative, De Niro relies on the intensity
of his presence, rather than the perceptive performance style that
has earned him two Academy Awards and four additional nominations,
and established him as one of the greatest screen actors of his
generation.
</P>
<P>
   De Niro anchors a solid international cast that also includes
Jean Reno (Godzilla, The Professional), Natascha McElhone (The
Truman Show) and Stellan Skarsgard (Good Will Hunting). All play
displaced spies now willing to sell their loyalties to the highest
bidder. But Ronin _ which takes its title from Japanese legend
about masterless samurai forced to wander the land as hired swords
_ bears the unmistakable mark of Frankenheimer.
</P>
<P>
   Frankenheimer established himself as a concerned, political
director during the 1960s with such films as The Manchurian
Candidate and Seven Days in May before moving on to mainstream
action-adventure with French Connection II, Black Sunday and 52
Pick Up. Most recently, he directed the dreadful remake of ``The
Island of Dr. Moreau'' with Marlon Brando and Val Kilmer.
</P>
<P>
   Ronin finds him back on familiar ground _ not so much with the
film's post-Cold War politics as with its exciting car chase and
stunt sequences. Frankenheimer shot the thrilling scenes the
old-fashioned way _ using real cars, rather than digital
compositing _ putting the audience in the action and his cast in
harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   The final chase, in which De Niro's character careens at top
speed through four lanes of oncoming traffic, will be remembered
among cinema's wildest rides. But the film itself is almost too
deliberately vague about the characters' backgrounds, making it
difficult to become involved in their mission.
</P>
<P>
   Six strangers gather silently in a Paris tavern, recognizing one
another as field soldiers from the Cold War. Sam (De Niro), an
American, is the last to enter, having surveyed the meeting place,
planting a gun near the rear exit. ``I never walk into a place I
don't know how to get out of,'' he later says.
</P>
<P>
   Sam is a battle strategist. Also present are English weapon
specialist Spence (Sean Bean), Eastern Bloc electronics expert
Gregor (Skarsgard), French coordinator Vincent (Reno), American
driver Larry (Skipp Sudduth) and Irish revolutionary Dierdre
(McElhone), the group's only contact to their employer.
</P>
<P>
   The operatives have been hired to retrieve a heavily guarded
suitcase with unspecified contents. Not that they matter _ it's
merely the McGuffin that drives the plot.
</P>
<P>
   The group's distrustful alliance is quickly undone by betrayal.
Suspense builds from one treacherous double-cross to the next,
leading to deadly high-speed chases down winding mountain roads and
narrow city streets in pursuit of the suitcase.
</P>
<P>
   De Niro plays his role with less-is-more stoicism, wearing a
grim, fixed expression through a gauntlet of harrowing situations.
To discuss which of the supporting cast earn our sympathy or enmity
would give up too much of the plot.
</P>
<P>
   The pity is that first-time screenwriter J.D. Zeik's
cloak-and-dagger intrigue is maddeningly ambiguous, leaving us
wanting more information about the characters' histories and ties.
The car chases also get a bit repetitive.
</P>
<P>
   Ronin works best as a visceral thrill ride, with an
overqualified De Niro at the wheel.

 &HT;    Commentary: Mushball for Bush
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Who wants to be president? Not George W. Bush, not
at least for two more years.
</P>
<P>
   Why be president when you're governor of a booming state the
size of France (bigger, actually), where you have a pliant
Legislature and an $8 billion wad of state surplus over the next
two years?
</P>
<P>
   Why leave this job when the most politically damaging thing
you've done is shoot the wrong bird in dove season?
</P>
<P>
   True, the most ambitious initiative you launched went down,
feathers and all, in the last legislative session. But few thought
less of you. After all, ``ambitious'' sounds suspicious in boom
times, unless it's the personal kind in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Someone should tell George Bush it's OK to sound ambitious, the
personal kind, on the campaign trail in Texas _ to say his heart
lusts for the presidency. And, don't worry, Governor, that what you
have in mind policywise for Texas sounds too ambitious, 'cause it
isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Richards used to hail an easy question as a ``softball.'' If
re-elected, the major legislative question facing Bush would be
softer than a softball, bigger and squishier even than the mushball
my old P.E. teacher had for ball games in a snowed-in gym.
</P>
<P>
   The question: How to disburse that $8 billion? Tough job.
Someone has to do it.
</P>
<P>
   The major feature of his proposals is one that Bush portrays as
both an investment in education and also in tax relief. He would
would take $2 billion and lower school property taxes statewide.
This, he says, would free school districts to raise taxes to pay
for their needs. He also talks about $1 billion in direct aid to
schools to spend as they see fit.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic opponent Garry Mauro wants to lift Texas teachers'
salaries to the nation's average with a $6,000 across-the-board
raise. Bush said pay raises above a modest hike in the state
minimum should be school districts' call.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro has ridiculed the $1 billion in property tax cuts approved
by the 1997 legislature under Bush, pointing out that in many cases
it quickly dissolved as school districts raised tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   That tax cut was the fall-back accomplishment of a session that
set out, at Bush's urging, to more dramatically reduce school
property taxes or eliminate them entirely with a more broad-based
tax system.
</P>
<P>
   Asked during a campaign stop in Waco if he would revisit tax
restructuring, Bush said no. He seems intent on the formula of his
first campaign for governor and his first legislative session: Keep
it simple, stupid.
</P>
<P>
   As for ambitions beyond Austin, Bush said he was ``amazed'' that
one poll recently gave him 48 percent support in a race with Al
Gore for president. Gore got 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get it,'' he said. ``Me _ little ol' me _ Gov. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, two key factors are at play: Gore's links to White
House scandals and the governor's having been linked directly to
Barbara Bush. But the governor was of no mind to exploit the
scandal. Perhaps in two years he'll find umbrage to vent. For now:
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very sad, somber moment,'' he said, saying the White
House scandal has a ``palling effect'' on perceptions about public
service.
</P>
<P>
   Too palling for him to make a run? Assuming re-election, Bush
said he'd decide this winter. ``I'm concerned about my daughters,''
he said. They have managed to remain off-limits for the press so
far.
</P>
<P>
   As for himself, Bush said, ``I know what it's like to be in the
bubble.''
</P>
<P>
   This decision will depend, untimately, on whether or not George
Bush wants to play hardball.
</P>

 &HT;    `COPS' on the prowl in Palm Beach
 &HT;    By Joe Brogan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Producers of the Fox television show
``COPS'' have been taping episodes with the Palm Beach County
Sheriff's Office, Martin County Sheriff's Office and Riviera Beach
police and will be in the area until December, producer Murray
Jordan said recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking for the average news story,'' he said,
adding the show was in town about five years ago. ``We're looking
for the off-beat and strange. We're in the entertainment
business.'' West Palm Beach police refused the show's request to
ride with their officers, said department spokeswoman Dena
Peterson. Department policy prohibits civilians on raids and
high-risk activity, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Riviera Beach has allowed the ``COPS'' team to ride along with
detectives, the SWAT team and the vice squad, said department
spokesman Det. Pat Galligan. ``It's a great morale booster,'' he
said. ``The guys love it, and it's a positive image for the
department.'' Jordan said the episodes would probably air in March.

 &HT;    Missionaries: Haitians likely unprepared for hurricane
 &HT;    By Bill Douthat
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Missionaries returning from Haiti
recently said residents of the impoverished country were woefully
unprepared for the winds and flooding of Hurricane Georges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably 90 percent of the people didn't even know it was
coming,'' said Tom Waller of North Carolina, who arrived at Palm
Beach International Airport at 5 p.m. on a Missionary Flights
International plane.
</P>
<P>
   Waller and 11 other church workers left Cap Haitien in northern
Haiti, just before high winds began to lash the coastline.
</P>
<P>
   Another passenger, Charles King, also of North Carolina, said
the permanent missionary in the mountain town of Mombin Crochu
tried to persuade the local mayor to open shelters. He got nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the mayor took it to heart,'' said King, a
refrigeration mechanic who spent two weeks at Mombin Crochu
building a dormitory wing on a hospital. ``He didn't seem
concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   King said most houses in the region are built with mud walls and
thin corrugated roofs, no match for hurricane-force winds.
</P>
<P>
   King said he saw no evidence of residents preparing for the
hurricane during his 48-mile ride from the town to the airport in
Cap Haitien.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there is much they can do,'' said Ric
Hallquist, who piloted the DC-3 plane from Cap Haitien. ``Most of
those houses aren't going to make it even in 40- to 50-mile-an-hour
winds.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Haitian immigrants in Palm Beach County are glued to Creole
language radio reports to follow news of the storm, said Daniella
Henry, coordinator of the Haitian American Community Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want Haiti to suffer another crisis at this
point,'' Henry said, referring to the country's economic and
political turmoil. ``One more disaster would be too much.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. residents with family and friends in the path of the storm
had mixed success reaching them by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane toppled a microwave tower in the U.S. Virgin
Islands, knocking out telephone communications, said AT&AMP;T spokesman
Andy Boisseau. He said service to Puerto Rico was good except in
some outlying areas with hurricane damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is also some network congestion because of so many calls
going down there,'' Boisseau said.
</P>
<P>
   Some lines were being reserved by the government for emergency
communications. Juan Beltran of West Palm Beach said he called the
number for his sister in Adjutas, in the mountainous central
region, but an operator said service was out because of the
hurricane. Beltran said his sister told him she was going to a
neighbor's home to ride out the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I know, there is very severe damage,'' Beltran said.
``But I have no way of finding out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Miami office of the Governor of Puerto Rico said information
on damages in Puerto Rican cities is available by dialing the
office at 888-212-6982.

 &HT;    Newcomers from Russia plant roots in Ohio
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The tiny tomato seeds from Moldavia are thriving
in their new home alongside their American counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to this special garden, those who tend them are thriving
as well. They, too, are transplants in a new land.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the fresh air and I like to work,'' says 75-year-old
Gregory Naydorf, kissing his fingers and waving them at the crisp
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Russia, I had a big garden, a dacha,'' Naydorf says,
explaining that many families in his native land moved to country
cottages in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was a farmer and we had grapes, fruit trees, a
lake,'' says Abram Goykman, who moved to Dayton from Chernovtsy in
the Ukraine nine years ago. ``I was in charge of a little garden
for our family and that is where we got all of our food. We didn't
go to the grocery store like people do here.''
</P>
<P>
   Goykman, 76, says he also was responsible for the family's cow
and the rabbits. ``I would get up early in the morning before
school to work in the garden,'' he remembers.
</P>
<P>
   Goykman and Naydorf are two of eight immigrants from the former
Soviet Union who have transformed land on the grounds of the Jewish
Community Complex into a bountiful garden.
</P>
<P>
   The experience has transformed lives as well, giving the new
Americans meaningful work and a reason to cherish each day.
</P>
<P>
   All of the men _ three teachers, a doctor, a colonel, a
pharmacist and a mechanical engineer _ had gardens at their former
homes. In addition to Naydorf and Goykman, they include Mendel
Shapochnik, David Fishman, Moshko Fishman, Donyel Polotsky, Lyova
Sadikov and Alexander Smolansky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy this, and it is nice to have the vegetables,'' says
Goykman, proudly pointing to his neatly planted rows of flowers,
herbs and vegetables. ``I was wounded with shrapnel in 1943 in St.
Petersburg, so I have a bad hip. But this I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   First plowed in May, the garden has become a gathering spot for
residents of Covenant Manor, the 50-unit apartment complex
developed for senior citizens and the disabled by the Jewish
Federation of Greater Dayton and the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
   From dusk to dawn _ between errands and doctor's appointments
and English lessons _ the men head for their gardens, planting,
weeding and watering. Some have chosen to work in pairs, others
maintain individual plots. The more experienced provide advice to
the neophytes.
</P>
<P>
   Lawn chairs clustered under the trees are a haven for their
wives, who come to chat and socialize. Visitors regularly show up,
too, including children from the Dayton Jewish Center day camp, who
sought advice on their gardening projects during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The women are busy turning the produce into Russian delights _
stuffed tomatoes and stuffed peppers, gevetch (a vegetable dish),
bowls of warm beet borscht.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, my daughter came over and I gave her a jar of sour
tomatoes,'' says Raisa Goykman, her eyes twinkling. ``She likes
them.''
</P>
<P>
   She and the others at Covenant Manor immigrated to the United
States with children and grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much easier to change your lifestyle when you are
young,'' says Dusya Sadikov, explaining that younger family members
are busy with jobs and school.
</P>
<P>
   ``But our English is very poor, we can't communicate with the
outside world a lot, so you have to look for things to do here
inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not for the vegetables and it's not because of (saving)
the money,'' says Sadikov. ``It's about being interested in
something, having something interesting to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The project began with Mendel Shapochnik, a devoted gardener who
began dreaming of a garden as soon as he set foot on American soil
five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always had a big garden in Moldavia,'' he says, ``with fruit
trees, vegetables, flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   First he gardened in a tiny space at Salem Woods Apartments,
later carefully transporting his apartment-grown seedlings on two
buses to his son's yard. Last year, Shapochnik persuaded
representatives from the Jewish Federation to plow some land for
himself and his friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had us put it next to the creek, which runs through the
property,'' says the federation's Barry Nove, who along with
building manager Roger Apple was instrumental in getting the
project under way.
</P>
<P>
   The gardeners, accustomed to improvising, used their ingenuity
as well: fashioning tools and fences from recycled items, damming
the creek, building steps down to the water and creating a system
for hauling it.
</P>
<P>
   As the word spread, the curious began coming, often returning to

<P>
   As a single woman, I can't help but look at America's
relationship with President Clinton as being like certain dating
relationships I've had, where it gets to be ``all about him.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``all about him'' relationship starts off equal. (In
America's case, you give him your vote, he gives you women in the
cabinet, pro-choice policies, a Middle East peace process.)
</P>
<P>
   Things seem to go fine for, oh, six years until suddenly he gets
busy. He can't meet you someplace. He's at the office all the time.
He's having problems he can't explain. It's not about you, America
_ he needs his space.
</P>
<P>
   So then, for eight whole months America is hysterical and on the
phone with everyone else in America. America just doesn't ``get''
him.
</P>
<P>
   America quizzes him endlessly _ and when America does, he gets
peeved. So, except for the special prosecutor (who, frankly, I
would've liked to have in a few of my dating relationships), our
country is having exactly the same kind of affair I often do. It's
``all about him,'' and America is stuck sitting home alone night
after night eating ice cream and watching John Gibson on MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   As a human woman, I don't like guys playing with my head. How
about a whole country's head? No wonder Americans are upset: We're
having a very dysfunctional relationship with whom? Not some guy _
the federal government! And most of us don't like to be hysterical
about the president of the United States all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, I find myself lying in bed, staring wistfully at the
ceiling, endlessly wondering if my president really cares about me,
or if he just wants to go down well in history.
</P>
<P>
   There's another element to this ``dating relationship'' many of
us are deluded about. As a country dating its president, America
seems to fit the mold of the ``trophy wife.'' I mean, in country
terms we're a hot number. The approval ratings for this president,
then, seem to be mostly about our desire to stay with him and go on
as a ``power couple.'' Young. Attractive. Well off. Nice GNP. (I
mean, so far, in the relationship.)
</P>
<P>
   I think America realizes that there are a lot of world leaders
whose calls we'd never even return let alone seriously discuss
impeaching! That's something to be considered.
</P>
<P>
   Dating analogy aside, self-centeredness is what ticks off
Americans most _ not the sex, not Ken Starr (the poor man's Terry
Southern), not even the $40 million (which just would've been blown
on bombers or IRS forms or something just as stupid.) It's the
``All About Him'' presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is this president and the Congress, and the House (the
members of which also seem to have ``all about me'' relationships
with their constituents) have long ago spurned their ``significant
other'' (America) in favor of it being all, and endlessly, about
them (and Geraldo Rivera). It's their air time, their election
campaigns, their pollsters.
</P>
<P>
   Well, guess what. America doesn't want to be laughed at by
France, lectured by England or repeatedly stood up by you. How we
got into this relationship I don't know _ we certainly didn't meet
the federal government at a health club _ but it's assuredly got to
end. We can't take it anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Truly, it should be all about us.

   ADMAN _ ATLANTA _ Luke Sullivan is of that generation who grew
up on Mr. Whipple, the gentle, meddlesome advertising character who
squeezed rolls of Charmin bathroom tissue with almost lascivious
glee. Somewhere along the line, around the time Sullivan became one
of the top admen in America, he began to wonder what it would be
like to put a bullet through the old geezer's head. Instead,
Sullivan _ creative director of Atlanta ad agency West/Wayne _
wrote a book: ``Hey Whipple, Squeeze This.'' The book doesn't so
much kill Mr. Whipple _ Procter &AMP; Gamble did that years ago _ as it
snuffs the idea that America is as dumb as Madison Avenue seems to
think. (Scott, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH PHOTOS. ETA: 6

time of year to plant because new trees, shrubs and perennials
aren't forced to do battle with the stress of heat that follows
spring, roots are allowed time to establish over winter and spring

 &HT;    Sleeping's gotten tricky, thanks to Rambo
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ This raccoon business is getting me down. I'm
not sleeping through the night and the cats are getting jumpy _
going on point every time they hear a suspicious noise. And it's
all because of one overly friendly raccoon who is intent on joining
the family.
</P>
<P>
   Lately I've been waking up in the middle of the night to a
scrabbling sound outside my bedroom window _ the one that opens
onto the porch roof. Owls, I used to think. Bats, I was pretty
sure. But not any more. Now I know what's out there looking in at
me with his
</P>
<P>
   little marble eyes aglow; it's that damned raccoon!
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago this furry fellow took to hanging out on the
roof of my sleeping porch _ a screened, treetop aerie outside the
back bedroom. I (BEGIN ITAL) used (END ITAL) to sleep there in a
hammock. But not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   About a week ago I had to pack up the quilts and move back into
my bedroom because Rambo the Raccoon began practicing his Kung
Fooey moves right over my head and wrecking my sleep. Besides, it's
a little unnerving to awake in the middle of the night to
</P>
<P>
   the sight of an amorphous blob hanging by his toenails from the
gutter and staring in at me
</P>
<P>
   like some masked peeping tom.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I've been asking a few hundred of my closest friends
what to do about this uninvited visitor. Answers vary, but the
theme is the same. Forget it. There is no way I'm going to shoot
anything with fur _ unless it's some pervert in a King Kong suit.
</P>
<P>
   Two nights ago I was blasted out of bed by what sounded like an
explosion. In a fruitless
</P>
<P>
   search for my slippers, I bashed my toe on a basket of books and
careened into a five-foot
</P>
<P>
   ficus tree. That's when I resorted to a few words invented by
the Angles and the Saxons
</P>
<P>
   that may not be reprinted here and are wholly unacceptable in
polite company.
</P>
<P>
   In an old house like mine, the first place to check for disaster
is the basement. I hate that.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong, my basement is a nice one, as basements go.
I have painted the walls
</P>
<P>
   and floor and there's a dried-up sage wreath from 14 Christmases
ago hanging above the
</P>
<P>
   ironing board. Rather a festive touch.
</P>
<P>
   But basements are where the water leaks. Like last week. The
water softener had a blow-out in the middle of the night, and I
never knew it until the cats came upstairs with wet feet. Their
sandboxes had become atolls in the South Basement Ocean. I spoke
Anglo-Saxon that night too.
</P>
<P>
   And now an explosion. On tiptoes lest I disturb the basement
gods in charge of keeping everything free of floods and tigers, I
make my way downstairs, stopping only to peek around the first
landing rail _ not wanting to face the imagined disaster full on.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing. So I press on. The boiler room is not in flame, the
water heater is crouched quietly doing its thing, the floor is dry,
and no rude noises are seeping out from under the cistern cover.
</P>
<P>
   Okay, I'm thinking, this is good. I'm going back to bed and
forget about the noise, but as
</P>
<P>
   I round the corner into my bedroom, I'm faced with the
realization that I have seriously underestimated my wily adversary
who by this time has one paw sticking through the screen. ``Shoo!''
I scream, following up with a series of whoops and hisses in the
biggest voice I can muster. Old Coon just stares. I warn him he has
crashed onto my roof for the last time.
</P>
<P>
   I know I have to do something and quick. Think like a raccoon, I
tell myself as I watch him grope for a pawhold. In a stroke of
brilliance, I grab the first thing at hand _ a perfume atomizer _
and spray the interloper.
</P>
<P>
   He freezes for a brief moment, puzzled, but when he gets a whiff
of himself he makes a grab for the nearest tree limb and boogies on
out of there.
</P>
<P>
   This raccoon has wrecked my sleep and ripped my screen. He has
pooped all over the porch roof and even left paw prints on my
windows, but I can't help feeling a little sorry for him because I
know that somewhere out there, Mr. Raccoon is having to explain to
Mrs. Raccoon how it happened that he came scuttling home in the
middle of the night reeking of White Shoulders.

like to put a bullet through the old geezer's head. Instead,
Sullivan _ creative director of Atlanta ad agency West/Wayne _
wrote a book: ``Hey Whipple, Squeeze This.'' The book doesn't so

   1. ``WE ALL PAY THE PRICE'' : ROBERT REDFORD INTERVIEW Interview
with U.S. movie director and actor Robert Redford on respect for
nature, life as a farmer and his latest film, 'The Horse
Whisperer.' By Bettina Musall and Marianne Wellershoff. From Der
Spiegel. 1,400 words. (English version available.) 2. WHY WE DON'T
TURN OFF THE TV Television is approaching the millennium on the
verge of its biggest upheaval since its invention and our love
affair with it is poised to enter a new and tumultuous phase. As
cable threatens network and old technology merges with new, the
medium that once brought us together is itself coming apart - and
yet television is, was and always will be the same, writes Frank
Rich. From The New York Times Magazine. 2,500 words. 3. ROBIN
WILLIAMS TACKLES THE FIGHT OF HIS AFTERLIFE Robin Williams is going
to hell ... and heaven, in the upcoming metaphysical drama ``What
Dreams May Come.'' Co-starring Annabella Sciorra and Cuba Gooding
Jr., it is his first film since winning a Best Supporting Actor
Oscar for ``Good Will Hunting.'' Williams talks about the new
movie, his own personal views of heaven and hell, how it felt to
finally take home an Oscar and why one of Hollywood's most
freewheeling party animals is now a domesticated, stay-at-home kind
of guy. By Cindy Pearlman. 1,400 words + photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 4.
FACE VALUE : GHOST APPEARANCE - ROBIN WILLIAMS In this new cartoon
feature from The New York Times Syndicate, artist Ricardo Castaneda
offers an intriguing take on Robin Williams, depicted as a
Casper-style ghost in his upcoming film, ``What Dreams May Come.''
5. WHOOPI GOLDBERG INTERVIEW Whoopi Goldberg has won an Oscar,
headlined a smash Broadway musical, staged her own one-woman show
and earned millions of dollars as co-host of ``Comic Relief.'' Now
she's the star and executive producer of a revival of the classic
game show ``Hollywood Squares.'' Goldberg talks about the show, why
she thinks there is no longer a stigma attached to movie stars
doing TV, why she thinks the press is unfair to her and to her
friend, President Clinton, and how she handles her unusual
bi-coastal relationship with Broadway star Frank Langella. By Jean
Oppenheimer. 1,400 words + photo. 
____________________________________________________________________
___ 6. OLD TUNES ARE THE BEST Remember the old saying : when
something is too stupid to say, you sing it? That's not true today.
Now you make a West End musical out of it, says Herb Greer. Modern
musicals try to dominate audiences, unlike older, often better
(usually American) shows. From Prospect magazine. 1,000 words. (N/A
U.K.)
_______________________________________________________________ 7.
OLD FILMS ARE THE BEST At this year's Cannes Film Festival, jury
leader Pierre Henri Deleau commented that British cinema had ``many
new film-makers thanks to the Lottery, but not an artistic movement
like the French nouvelle vague.'' Charles Drazin puts Britain's
current film renaissance into historical perspective. From Prospect
magazine. 1,500 words. (N/A U.K.)
_______________________________________________________________ 8.
MUSIC'S DYING FALL In every generation there are those who bemoan
the death of classical music. But what if, this time round, they
are right? A living musical culture is being crushed between
easy-listening commercialisation and an unmusical avant-garde which
speaks only to itself. Unlike Nato expansion or monetary union, the
death of music is not a trivial subject. It is a tragedy of epic
proportions, writes Geoffrey Wheatcroft. From Prospect magazine.
3,000 words. (N/A U.K.)
_______________________________________________________________ 9.
MALCOLM MCDOWELL PLAYS THE DARK SIDE OF FANTASY ISLAND Malcolm
McDowell, the young English rebel of ``A Clockwork Orange,''
(1971,) is a silver-haired 55-year-old now, just right to step into
the white shoes of ``Fantasy Island's'' Mr. Roarke. McDowell says
he took the part because it was dark. ``I liked the producer's sort
of 'Men in Black' approach to it ... When I show it to friends in
Europe, they see Roarke as God. When I show it to Americans, they
think he's the Devil. What do you think that says about the two
cultures?'' By Ivor Davis. 1,000 words + photos. (N/A Great Britain
and Australia.)
_______________________________________________________________ 10.
BARBARA HERSHEY SOLDIERS ON One of the many intriguing characters
in ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries'' is a flamboyant young man
growing up in Paris who knows that he's destined to have a life in
the creative arts. Barbara Hershey, who stars in the film, can
relate to this. ``I wanted to act all my life, from childhood. I
always felt lucky to know what I felt I was supposed to do. It was
this tiny golden thread of knowledge about myself amidst all the
insecurities of life.'' By J. Mooney.1,100 words. BPI.

NEW MOON BOOK RAISES CHARGES, COUNTERCHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH P. KAHN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new book by the former daughter-in-law of Unification Church
leader Rev. Sun Myung Moon has spawned charges of plagiarism
against the book's authors _ one of whom is a Boston Globe
columnist _ and countercharges that the church is orchestrating a
``smear campaign'' against a prominent defector.
</P>
<P>
   The book, titled ``In the Shadow of the Moons'' and published
this month by Little, Brown, is a scalding memoir by Nansook Hong
of Lexington, Mass. about her marriage into, and troubled exit
from, the Moon family's inner circle. Eileen McNamara, the Globe's
Pulitzer Prize-winning Metro columnist, collaborated on the memoir
with Hong, although ghostwriter McNamara's name appears nowhere in
the text or on the book jacket.
</P>
<P>
   McNamara and Hong have been targeted by a pair of accusers who
maintain that ``Shadow of the Moons'' borrows liberally _ too
liberally _ from a book about the Unification Church by George D.
Chryssides. Both McNamara and Hong deny the accusation.
</P>
<P>
   Chryssides, a professor of religious studies in England,
published his book, ``The Advent of Sun Myung Moon,'' in 1991.
While Hong's book spills secrets about drug use, gambling,
adultery, and domestic violence within the Moon family,
Chryssides's work focuses largely on church history and doctrine,
subjects that Hong's book treats only peripherally.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter faxed to Globe editor Matthew V. Storin Friday,
Chryssides contends that a careful comparison of the two texts
``reveals that several passages have been plagiarized'' and that
other passages and quotes were used without proper authorization or
attribution. Chryssides provided no supporting material. However, a
separate letter sent to the Globe by Moon family attorney Jeremiah
Gutman repeated Chryssides's charges and did specify passages,
eight in all.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a Globe inquiry, Little, Brown attorney Heather
Kirkpatrick termed the charges ``unfounded and without merit of any
kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Kirkpatrick, ``The `parallels' cited by Dr. Chryssides are
factual statements of the history and tradition of the Unification
Church which have appeared in many publications on the subject. The
resulting similarities do not constitute plagiarism.''
</P>
<P>
   Chryssides's accusations all deal with passages involving church
ritual and lore. McNamara contends that many sources recount
similar stories using similar words. However, in at least two of
the examples cited by Gutman, there are textual similarities,
notably in stories about the House of Three Doors and the legend of
the ``great ancestor'' Tangun.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early days of the Unification Church, in 1954,'' writes
Chryssides of the Three Doors, ``the Rev. Moon and his followers
resided in a small house in Seoul, which had only two very small
rooms with a small kitchen. The house was popularly called the
`House of the Three Doors.' ...''
</P>
<P>
   On Page 25 of the Hong book, this passage appears: ``In the
early days of the Unification Church, members met in a small house
with two rooms. It was known as the House of Three Doors.''
</P>
<P>
   McNamara acknowledges having read Chryssides's book and using
it, along with as many as 34 other sources, as research material.
McNamara says she urged Little, Brown to publish a bibliography and
chapter notes with Hong's text, which the publisher concedes it
declined to do. In addition, says McNamara, Chryssides and others
have themselves borrowed liberally from church lore, which Hong
memorized during her years in the church and later repeated to
McNamara.
</P>
<P>
   Of the House of Three Doors, says McNamara, ``That's the way Nan
told me the story. I did read Chryssides's book. I read a lot of
books. I did not plagiarize from Mr. Chryssides.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached in England last week, Chryssides declined to comment,
saying he was seeking the advice of lawyers representing his
British publisher. He did not return a call placed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gutman said Tuesday that he has never met Chryssides and has
only spoken to him once, after receiving a copy of the letter the
author sent to the Globe and ``60 Minutes,'' which broadcast an
interview with Hong Sunday. He denied knowing of any ties between
Chryssides and the Unification Church and rejected charges that
Moon and his followers are out to discredit Hong or her book.
</P>
<P>
   Gutman represented Hong's ex-husband in the couple's divorce
proceedings. Late last year, Moon lawyers tried to limit Hong's
publicity efforts on behalf of the book by invoking a clause in the
divorce agreement prohibiting actions by Hong that would be
detrimental to the couple's children _ including, the lawyers
alleged, Hong's speaking publicly about her ex-husband's behavior.
Middlesex Probate Judge Edward Ginsberg, who presided over the
divorce procedings, dismissed the petition.
</P>
<P>
   Little, Brown publisher Sarah Crichton characterizes the charges
against Hong and McNamara as ``clearly part of the church's many
attempts to discredit this book. To call this plagiarism amounts to
a smear campaign. It's outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Tuesday, Storin said, ``We are pleased
by the statement of Little, Brown refuting the charges made by Dr.
George Chryssides against Eileen McNamara as ghostwriter of the
book, `In the Shadow of the Moons.' We have the highest regard for
Eileen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the Boston Globe had no control over the content or
editing of'' the book, the statement concluded. ``Indeed, we had no
prior knowledge of the material nor any relationship with its
publication.''
</P>
<P>
   Hong, who was on a book tour in New York Tuesday, said through
her publisher: ``They have tried to stop this book before. I've
been expecting some kind of attack. This is one way for them to try
to discredit me and the book _ as well as my integrity.''

 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 NOTE: Full-length article (8,600 words) available on request  
 &HT;    George Walker Bush was visiting his parents in the White House
one day when the talk turned to religion, which is precisely the
subject that some powerful factions in the Republican Party want
their presidential standard-bearer to talk about, forcefully, in
2000.
 &HT;    But Bush, sitting one day recently on a sofa in the governor's
office at the Texas State Capitol, says he is ``cautious about
wearing my religion on my sleeve in the political process.'' And he
offers this particular story to explain why.
 &HT;    ``Mother and I were arguing _ not arguing, having a discussion _
and discussing who goes to Heaven,'' recalls the governor, who at
the time had religion very much on his mind.
 &HT;    Having dealt with a gathering drinking problem by abruptly
swearing off alcohol, he had vowed a renewed commitment to his
family and his faith. Bush pointed to the Bible: Only Christians
had a place in heaven.
 &HT;    ``I said, Mom, look, all I can tell you is what the New
Testament says. And she said, well, surely, God will accept others.
And I said, Mom, here's what the New Testament says. And she said,
OK, and she picks up the phone and calls Billy Graham. She says to
the White House operator, Get me Billy Graham.
 &HT;    ``I said, Mother, what are you doing?'' Bush continues,
chuckling at the memory. ``Seriously. And about two minutes later,
the phone rings, and it's Billy Graham, and Mother and I are on the
phonewith Billy. And Mother explains the circumstances, and Billy
says, From a personal perspective, I agree with what George is
saying, the New Testament has been my guide. But I want to caution
you both. Don't play God. Who are you two to be God?''
 &HT;    For George W. Bush, a man who, in large part because of his
famous name, shows up in most polls these days as the very early
front-runner for a Republican presidential nomination battle that
is still more than a year away, it is an interesting story to
choose to relate.
 &HT;    Bush says it explains in part why he urged an end to ``name
calling'' this summer when a fracas broke out over his party's
decision to bar a gay Republican group from setting up a booth at
the GOP state convention.
 &HT;    ``There are some great admonitions in the Bible, talking about,
you know, don't try to take the speck out of your neighbor's eye
when you've got a log in your own,'' Bush says. ``I'm mindful of
that.''
 &HT;    And in his nearly four years as governor of the nation's
second-largest state, there has been strikingly little name-calling
from Bush. He talks constantly about being a ``unifier, not a
divider,'' and few things seem to make him happier than forging a
bipartisan consensus on some big bill.
 &HT;    He has grown so close to some Democratic lawmakers that he once
said there was ``no way in the world'' he could bring himself to
campaign against them.
 &HT;    Running now for his own re-election, Bush campaigns ferociously
in Democratic strongholds such as El Paso, where he breaks into
near-fluent Spanish before a delighted crowd at a ''Viva Bush!''
rally and where the Democratic mayor, Carlos Ramirez, introduces
him as ``the best governor of Texas that El Paso has ever had.''
 &HT;    For these and many other reasons, the 52-year-old eldest son of
former President George Bush is riding a broad wave of popularity
that, if current polls hold true, will carry him to a sweeping
victory this November as the first governor re-elected in Texas in
24 years, the first ever elected to back-to-back four-year terms.
 &HT;    Already, more than 100 Democratic officeholders have endorsed
him, including the state's lieutenant governor, a gruff political
veteran named Bob Bullock, who announced his support for Bush's
re-election even though he is godfather to the daughter of Bush's
Democratic opponent, Garry Mauro, the state land commissioner.
 &HT;    But if all this bodes well for Bush's re-election prospects in
Texas, and arguably for his prospects as a national candidate in a
general election, it also raises some obvious and perhaps
treacherous questions for the governor.
 &HT;    These are questions he would surely find tossed at him by
primary opponents if, in a step he is widely expected to take, he
runs for his father's old job. Just why do all those Democrats like
him so much? What kind of a Republican is he?
 &HT;    Why, for example, have some of his fiercest battles been with
his fellow Republicans? Some, including the state chairman of his
party at the time, are still furious with the governor over a tax
proposal he devised that would have radically reshaped the state
tax system, providing more money for some of the poorest public
schools in part by slapping new taxes on some of the biggest
industries.
 &HT;    Reticent on abortion, disinclined to denounce homosexuals, a
self-described fiscal conservative who is willing to spend money on
new programs such as a huge public-school reading initiative, Bush
does not seem to be offering the orthodoxy that some Republican
conservatives insist will be necessary in the party's candidate in
2000.
 &HT;    For all the speculation right now over whether Bush will want to
run for president _ speculation that has only seemed to grow more
fevered as scandal engulfs President Bill Clinton and threatens
Vice President Al Gore, the Democrat with the most obvious
presidential ambitions _ the more intriguing question may in time
turn out to be whether today's Republican Party wants someone like
Bush as its nominee.
 &HT;    Many party foot soldiers, still angry over the way they feel the
1996 nominee, Bob Dole, essentially ignored abortion, school prayer
and other issues they care most about, are determined to find a
candidate who will carry the torch _ or else. Many use Dole's name
as a verb, and not in a nice way _ ``We won't get Doled again,''
they say.
 &HT;    Bush insists that he is a cultural conservative and promotes
what he calls ``the responsibility era.'' But candidates are
already lining up to his right, including the deep-pocketed Steve
Forbes, the flat-tax fanatic of 1996 who this time around is making
an all-out pitch to social conservatives.
 &HT;    Forbes describes a ban on the procedure known as partial-birth
abortion as his foremost priority, ``the first step toward putting
abortion on the road to ultimate extinction in the United States of
America.''
 &HT;    Bush describes himself as ``pro-life,'' supports the
partial-birth abortion ban and pledges to propose a bill next year
requiring parental consent for a minor's abortion _ ``issues over
which we can make a difference,'' he says.
 &HT;    But on the basic question of the right of most women in most
circumstances to obtain an abortion, his position is that the
Supreme Court has already settled the law. And, to date, he has not
pledged any kind of crusade to sweep away those rulings; whether he
might do so in the heat of a primary campaign remains an open
question.
 &HT;    The Bush balancing act will be infinitely tougher to sustain in
the glare of the national stage. And how odd it seems, at least to
some, that so many Republicans might look to a man named George
Bush as their savior, given that George Bush lost it all for the
party just six years ago.
 -0- 
 &HT;    President Bush was at a steakhouse in Council Bluffs, Iowa, one
October day in 1994, reminiscing with some supporters from the old
days, when he excused himself to take a cellular telephone call.
The father was intently following the progress of two of his sons,
George and Jeb, in their respective gubernatorial campaigns against
savvy Democratic veterans in Texas and Florida, and new poll
numbers were just in.
 &HT;    ``He came back and he said, It looks like Jeb's OK, but I'm
worried about George,'' recalled Gordon C. James, a member of the
White House advance team in the Bush administration. ``He was upset
about it.''
 &HT;    Both races looked close, but like a lot of people, the president
saw evidence that Jeb (a nickname John Ellis Bush takes from his
initials) would pull it out over Lawton Chiles and that George's
race against a popular incumbent, Ann W. Richards, was just too
uphill a fight.
 &HT;    As things turned out, though, some invisible law of political
primogeniture seemed to kick in _ the older brother won and the
younger did not. (Late this summer, however, while George W. is
cruising toward re-election, Jeb is, according to the polls,
comfortably ahead too in his second bid for the governor's Mansion
in Tallahassee.)
 &HT;    Back in 1994, in seeing the softer-spoken, genial Jeb as the
more likely success in politics, people in the Bush family were
relying on much more than polling data. It's not that George W.
wasn't as determined to win as any Bush.
 &HT;    ``I think the major word to describe George W. circa 1993 and
the governorship was competitiveness,'' said Chase Untermeyer, a
longtime family friend and former presidential personnel director.
(Asked to compare George W. and his father in this regard,
Untermeyer said with a laugh: ``It is such a competitive family,
it's hard to make those shadings there. That's a driven
situation.'')
 &HT;    But if George W. Bush was driven, he was also known for a sharp
tongue and temper _ the ``Roman candle of the family ... and
likeliest to burn the fingers,'' as he is aptly described in
Richard Ben Cramer's ``What It Takes,'' the exhaustive account of
the 1988 presidential campaign.
 &HT;    When the Queen of England came to a White House dinner, Barbara
Bush sat George W. at the other end of the table, just to make sure
he didn't say anything undiplomatic to Her Majesty. He was the pit
bull brought in to deliver the bad news to the president's pit bull
of a chief of staff, John Sununu, when it was time for Sununu to
leave the White House.
 &HT;    And Bush, an unpaid adviser to his father, quarreled with
reporters during the 1992 campaign, frequently accusing them of
having a bias against the president.
 &HT;    Even Bush doesn't bother to deny that he was brusque in those
days.
 &HT;    ``I love my Dad, and it should not surprise you that I was a
fierce warrior on his behalf,'' he said, as his campaign plane
rumbled over the central Texas prairie one day this spring. ``And
if that ruffled people's feathers, so be it. There's a big
difference between being the son of a candidate and being the
candidate. And I understand the difference.''
 &HT;    And certainly, there was a difference by the time George W.
began his campaign for governor in 1994, a bid he contemplated four
years earlier but passed up, in part over concerns that running
with his father in the White House might look too opportunistic _
and be too embarrassing to all the Bushes if he lost.
 &HT;    Running against Ann W. Richards, the feisty and sharp-witted
incumbent who once famously derided his father as ``poor old
George,'' born with a ``silver foot in his mouth,'' Bush would seem
to have had ample reason to lose his cool.
 &HT;    In the course of the campaign, Richards called him ``Shrub,''
``that young Bush boy'' and ''some jerk,'' and joked that he was
``missing his Herbert'' (a reference to his father's two middle
names).
 &HT;    Richards frequently said that if Bush's name were George Walker,
without the Bush, no one would even take his campaign seriously _ a
point not without merit.
 &HT;    All the barbs and his prior reputation notwithstanding, Bush
turned in a truly remarkable performance. He did not lose his cool
at all, and at times he laughed right along with Richards,
basically telling voters that she sure was a funny lady, whom
everybody enjoyed, but that he came from a party and held to a
conservative philosophy that were more in line with what Texans
wanted in government. (Not that Bush wasn't out for revenge: As he
explained at the time, his strategy was to ``kill her with
kindness.'')
 &HT;    And for a man who had seemingly wandered through much of his 20s
and 30s, and who conceded that the main question surrounding him
was, ``What's the boy ever done?'' he ran a thoroughly disciplined
campaign.
 &HT;    Mindful that his father had lacked a coherent message in 1992,
Bush offered voters a precise, four-point plan for better
government: more control for local school districts, stricter
provisions for welfare recipients, tougher juvenile-justice laws
and reform of the state's tort laws. He never deviated from the
message. And while hardly the most scintillating set of political
themes ever developed, it allowed him to sidestep other issues,
particularly abortion.
 &HT;    Bush says the only painful episode from the campaign was a brief
flap over an interview he gave an Austin reporter about religion,
in which he reiterated his own personal belief that the path to
Heaven leads through acceptance of Christ as one's personal savior.
 &HT;    ``It was, of course, picked up and politicized _ you know, 'Bush
to Jews: Go to Hell,''' he recalls. ``It was very ugly. It hurt my
feelings.''
 &HT;    On election night, buoyed by the Republican surge that led to
the takeover of Congress, Bush won going away, 54 percent to 46
percent.
 &HT;    Jeb Bush, meanwhile, ran a campaign with a much sharper
conservative edge, speaking out against abortion and selecting a
Christian Coalition ``legislator of the year'' as his running mate.
To someone who briefly watched him campaign in 1994, the difference
this year is striking. He seems to have taken a page from his
brother, offering a much more upbeat message, reaching out to
minority groups, emphasizing education and greater ``compassion''
in state services.
 &HT;    Taking a break from a sweltering day of campaigning this summer
in West Palm Beach, Jeb Bush let out a tight laugh as he gave
credit to his big brother for proving himself ``the better
politician.''
 &HT;    ``He ran on four or five items or whatever it was, and he stayed
focused on that,'' Bush said. ``And that is a great lesson in
politics.''
 &HT;    Jeb Bush said he speaks to his brother about running for the
White House only ``in the contingent, in the conditional,'' but
adds that he has no doubt that his brother has ``the right stuff''
to be president.
 &HT;    And what if anyone tries to run to George W.'s right, by
emphasizing abortion or other specific social issues?
 &HT;    ``I think they'll fail,'' Jeb Bush said, ``because the broader
moral questions are the ones that concern the great majority of
people out there that fit this criteria of 'cultural
conservatives.' It is so sterile to talk about the things that the
press in this state wants to try to create, or my opponent.
Basically the same thing. There's all this Christian right, and
abortion. These are not the issues that drive people's concerns.
They want to know, how do they get the support to make sure their
children don't take drugs. They want their schools to be safe.
 &HT;    ``I'm very confident,'' he added, ``that George Bush will be
very successful if he stays the course with his message.''

Father'')

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    George W. Bush, the governor of Texas, likes to say that the
fundamental difference between him and his father is that the
former president attended Greenwich Country Day School, while he
went to San Jacinto Junior High School in Midland, Texas.
 &HT;    Born in 1946 in New Haven, George and Barbara Bush's first
child, young ``Georgie'' was along for the famous journey when his
father struck out for West Texas in a 1947 Studebaker.
 &HT;    He was a mischievous boy with a passion for sports, especially
baseball, and a penchant for wisecracks that may well have its
origins in a family tragedy. George was 7 years old when his
sister, Robin, 3, died of leukemia, and both of his parents told
friends that George seemed to develop a joking, bantering style in
a determined bid to lift them from their grief. (There are five
Bush children, four sons and a surviving daughter.)
 &HT;    He did spend many formative years in Midland, and attended the
public schools there. But while his identity as a Texan has never
been mocked to the degree his father's was, the younger Bush has
preppy credentials that parallel those of his father. He went to
Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., and to Yale University. In
fact, much of Bush's life seems to be a slightly eerie, and not
always successful, bid to retrace the footsteps of the famous
father.
 &HT;    ``You have to really understand how much his father was loved
and respected by so many people to understand what it would be like
to grow up as a namesake, the son of George Bush, `` said George W.
Bush's first cousin, John Ellis, a Boston-based marketing and
advertising consultant who is close to the governor.
 &HT;    ``There are all these parallels in his life. 'He went to
Andover, went to Yale, went to West Texas, ran for Congress, and at
every stage of that he was found wanting. To go through every stage
of life and be found wanting and know that people find you wanting,
that's a real grind.''
 &HT;    To Bush's critics, his prolonged rowdy days and his
unspectacular early career make his later political success _ in
which simply having the name ``George Bush'' was undeniably a
crucial, perhaps THE crucial, element _ all the more irritating,
and undeserved. But in Ellis' view, his cousin's later
achievements, which came after his marriage and his decision to
quit drinking, are all the more impressive in light of the wayward
years.
 &HT;    ``He gathered it together,'' said Ellis. ``George was on the
road to nowhere at 40. At the age of 52, he's the front-runner for
the Republican presidential nomination. That's a pretty incredible
turnaround.''
 &HT;    Bush himself does not deny that he is a classic late bloomer; he
refers to the ``nomadic years'' of his youth and once explained he
``kind of floated and saw a lot of life'' throughout his 20s. He
even jokes about all this, though one wonders if the stand-up
monologue he delivered to a howling audience this past winter at
Washington's elite Alfalfa Club, with his father present, had just
a tinge of bitter truth to it.
 &HT;    ``Can you imagine how much it hurt,'' said George Walker Bush,
``to know that Dad's idea of the perfect son was'' _ and then he
paused before delivering the line that brought down the house _
``Al Gore?''
 &HT;    At Yale, just like his father, Bush was in the secretive Skull
and Bones club. He was president of his fraternity, Delta Kappa
Epsilon, though, as a less-than-diligent student, he did not follow
the old man into Phi Beta Kappa. In any event, he says he did not
like a lot of the ``intellectual arrogance'' and ''snobs'' at Yale,
and he cites one incident as particularly galling.
 &HT;    Several months after his father lost the 1964 Texas Senate
campaign to Ralph Yarborough, the incumbent Democratic populist,
Bush said he met Yale's prominent campus chaplain.
 &HT;    ``I ran into William Sloane Coffin, who was the preacher at
Yale, supposedly the guy that was there to comfort students,'' the
governor said. ``I introduced myself and he said, Yeah, I know your
father, and your father lost to a better man.''
 &HT;    Even today, 33 years later, Bush is clearly offended by the
statement, and it is one of the many reasons, he says, that he
couldn't wait to get back to Texas, after his graduation in 1968:
``Texas people are more polite. I don't think a Texan would do that
to a son.''
 &HT;    When Bush talks about his father, this is not the only trace of
bitterness. Victory in the Persian Gulf War, he told Texas Monthly,
was ``one of the great achievements of the 20th century, and it had
a shelf life of about a month.'' He is also still bothered, as he
later puts it in an interview, by the ``factors that caused this
good man to get defeated.''
 &HT;    And he raises at least one that could well resurface in some
fashion: ``Patrick J. Buchanan handing the baton, the proverbial
political knife, off to Ross Perot _ the kind of isolationism and
nativism and very harsh attacks against George Bush. You die a
death of a thousand cuts in the political process.''
 &HT;    George the younger obviously loves and reveres his father, and
he has plenty of characteristics _ the impish half-grin, the chop
in the air, the passion for foods that gross out some of his staff
(bologna sandwiches, in his case) _ that strikingly betray his
genes.
 &HT;    And yet, President Bush has been curiously absent from his son's
campaigns and oratory. Barbara Bush shows up much more often. One
of the governor's stock campaign jokes involves going to get his
hair cut, and having the barber marvel: ``I can't believe I'm
cutting the hair of the son of Barbara Bush.''
 &HT;    Partly, the governor simply wants to be seen as his own man _
not ``just another rich son of a Bush,'' as the Texas populist Jim
Hightower describes him. And for his part, the president ``almost
makes it a point not to advise him too much, on the theory that
people would say, 'Hey, you're just Daddy's boy,' `` said George
Strake, a former Republican state chairman in Texas and a Bush
family friend.
 &HT;    But there is clearly another undercurrent here. While President
Bush remains personally popular with Americans, any prominent role
in a national campaign could resurrect the ambivalence many
Republicans felt about him. And it could lead to questions about
just how his son differs from him politically, if at all.
 &HT;    Neither Bush nor his top aides will even take much of a stab at
that. (One, insisting he not be quoted by name, offered this
thought: ``I think the father was more of a noblesse oblige
politician, while George W. Bush is a conviction politician.''
Hardly a comparison to flatter the old man.)
 &HT;    President and Mrs. Bush declined requests for an interview for
this story. But a couple of weeks ago, a two-and-a-half-page letter
from Kennebunkport came whirring across my fax machine, a response
to a series of written questions.
 &HT;    In it, President Bush wrote of the ``enormous pride'' he felt as
he watched two of his sons make their way in public life. ``Both
Jeb and George were at my side in some pretty tough times,'' he
said, ``and they know firsthand what Teddy Roosevelt's `Arena' is
really like. I hope they never say, 'It's not worth it.'''
 &HT;    The former president said he was reluctant to speak out on
issues these days, ''because I don't want some reporter from
Washington rushing down to one of our sons after I stake out a
position on an issue saying: 'Your Dad says so and so. ... Why
don't you agree?'
 &HT;    ``I had my chance,'' Bush continued. ``Now it is their time and
I am determined to stay out of the way. To support them where they
want me to. But not to inadvertently cause complications for
them.''
 &HT;    George W. Bush knows that if he runs, everybody will be asking
questions about his relationship with his father. ``Doonesbury''
has already given the governor his cartoon identity: a junior-size
point of light. The governor says he's neither concerned nor
interested. ``These are the kind of psychological analyses that I'm
not really thrilled about talking about,'' he explains. ``It's not
my thing.
 &HT;    ``You occasionally read about, 'Well, he must prove himself''' _
the governor draws out the words with a theatrical flair _ ```to be
different from his father.' The voice is out of Washington, and the
Echo Chamber. `Well, he must distinguish himself''' _ more emphasis
_ ```from his father.' Well, therein lies the dilemma. But I don't
listen to them. Because all I've got to do is be myself.
 &HT;    ``By being myself I will distinguish myself from my father,
because we're two separately different people. I've got half my
mother in me and half my father in me, which is a pretty
interesting combination.''
 &HT;    When George W. got back to Texas in 1968, he joined the Texas
Air National Guard and for five years spent some weekends and
longer stints flying fighter jets. His unit was never called for
service in the Vietnam War, and by enlisting in the guard, he was
automatically removed as a candidate for the military draft, an
issue that flared briefly in the 1994 gubernatorial campaign and
undoubtedly would again in a national race.
 &HT;    In 1992, gearing up for his Texas campaign, Bush told The New
York Times that while he was prepared to serve, he had trouble
remembering what his position was on the war when he was in
college. While that may sound implausible, people who knew him at
the time said that Bush indeed showed virtually no interest in
public policy, or politics.
 &HT;    It seems inconceivable, for instance, that he could ever have
written anyone a letter brooding over how to ``maintain my
political viability within the system,'' to use the memorable
phrase from a 1969 letter sent by a young man named Bill Clinton,
born the month after George W. Bush, to the director of the
University of Arkansas' Reserve Officers Training Corps program.
 &HT;    What most seems to have marked the decade after Bush graduated
from college was his wandering, carousing nature. He held a series
of jobs, working on an offshore rig and (miserably) for an
agricultural firm, and mentoring inner-city youth in Houston.
 &HT;    But he was best known as a major-league partygoer, often seen
driving around town in his Triumph and in the company of attractive
young women.
 &HT;    As governor, Bush has clearly succeeded in drawing a rather huge
zone of privacy around the question of just how wild his wild days
were. He declines to answer specific questions about matters such
as drug use.
 &HT;    ``There were things I did that were mistakes,'' he said. ``But I
think inventorying mistakes is a mistake. I think they send wrong
signals. I think they undermine the message.
 &HT;    ``I'd be the first to admit that I did irresponsible things when
I was young and irresponsible,'' he continued. ``I've assumed the
mantle of being a governor and a father in a responsible way, and
the signal we ought to send to our children is that in spite of
what happened in the '60s and '70s, we have learned some lessons.
And the lesson ought to be, don't be using drugs and alcohol. Learn
the lessons from the past.''

 WILD YOUNG '60s GUY JUMPS INTO MARRIAGE, BUSINESS and POLITICS

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    There is something potentially incongruous about George W. Bush
as the self-described promoter of ``a responsibility era.'' As one
who seems to have indulged freely in his past, Bush now routinely
lectures high-schoolers to ``abstain from sex until you've found
the person you want to marry.''
 &HT;    And when Bush stepped ever so gingerly into the White House sex
scandal, saying recently he felt ``embarrassed for the country,''
Lanny J. Davis, a Clinton adviser, leapt in with a response. Noting
that he had been at Yale with Bush, Davis said on national
television that the governor ``shouldn't throw stones.''
 &HT;    On the other hand, Bush's message is reflective of the country
at large. He is, after all, just one of countless tens of thousands
of parents who came of age in the 1960s and are now saying much the
same thing to their kids.
 &HT;    In a generally laudatory piece about Bush's campaign for values
in this summer's edition of City Journal, a publication of the
conservative Manhattan Institute, Tucker Carlson suggested that
Bush may in fact be the perfect spokesman for ``the politics of
virtue.''
 &HT;    ``Before his marriage, Bush had a reputation (from all accounts,
deserved) as something of a wild man,'' Carlson wrote. ``When he
speaks, it is as a grizzled veteran of the sexual revolution. But
he is a changed man.''
 &HT;    In a two-and-a-half-page letter, with responses to a series of
questions I posed for this article, President Bush (he declined to
be interviewed) made a point of dismissing the notion that his son
ever seriously lost his way in any of these years.
 &HT;    ``I asked Barbara to read this letter,'' the president wrote.
``She asked me to add that, like me, she never felt George was a
problem _ that he never had trouble 'finding himself.' She
believes, as I do, that 'the wild young man' thesis is greatly
overblown.
 &HT;    ``George really never had trouble 'finding himself,''' Bush
added in the next paragraph. ``He had some happy times, but none of
this 'worried' Barbara and me. He never lost his bearing. He always
came home.''
 &HT;    In 1973, George W. Bush decided he wanted to become serious
about a business career, and he entered Harvard Business School.
Two years later, driving a 1970 Cutlass, he retraced a famous
journey to West Texas his father made in 1948, and headed back
south and west toward dusty Midland. True, given his family
contacts, this was hardly a journey into the great unknown.
 &HT;    Bush's plan was to jump into the oil business, but before long
he was jumping into other things as well: marriage and politics. In
1977, he married Laura Welch, a librarian and schoolteacher from
Midland who is, by wide agreement, a crucial influence in both the
governor's personal transformation and his political success.
 &HT;    With a down-to-earth style, an infectious sense of humor and
campaigns reminiscent of her mother-in-law's, for breast-cancer
awareness and literacy, she is wildly popular in Texas.
 &HT;    Having rarely even been in the area for a decade before his
return, Bush made a brash decision when the 44-year incumbent
Democratic congressman, George Mahon, announced his retirement that
same year. At the age of 31, Bush declared for the seat, and he and
Laura were off on what they call their extended honeymoon.
 &HT;    ``We had a really great time,'' recalls Laura Bush with a hearty
laugh, during an interview at the Governor's Mansion in Austin.
``It was a great way to spend the first year of marriage. We drove
up and down the Panhandle of Texas, from Hereford to Midland.''
 &HT;    In that campaign, Bush got his first taste of themes that
plagued his father's own races in Texas, which included two losing
bids for the U.S. Senate. George W.'s Democratic opponent, Kent
Hance, now a friend and supporter, cleverly played up Bush's
prep-school, Ivy League credentials, which didn't exactly go over
big in rough-and-tumble places such as Odessa.
 &HT;    With his father serving on international boards such as the
Rockefeller-financed Trilateral Commission, the candidate found
himself hectored by groups who said he too was surely a tool of the
New World Order. He finally had to go on record with his opposition
to ``one-world government and one monetary system.''
 &HT;    ``And if the Trilateral Commission supports those things,'' he
explained at the time, ``I'm sure my father is a dissenting
voice.''
 &HT;    Bush lost and, any political aspirations of his own put on hold
for the next decade and a half, he burrowed into the oil business,
founding an exploration company and digging into mineral records.
He was still known as a big party guy, and his friends gave him no
end of a hard time about being both a tightwad and a notoriously
sloppy dresser.
 &HT;    ``George would wear anything anyone would give him,'' said Dr.
Charles Younger, an orthopedic surgeon in Midland and a longtime
friend.
 &HT;    As the holiday season approached one year, his friends all got
together and collected a sheaf of tacky corporate Christmas cards
from West Texas oil firms, then conspicuously crossed out the
company name under the greeting and replaced it with ``Merry
Christmas, from George and Laura Bush.''
 &HT;    ``The funny thing is, I think at least half the people who got
them probably thought it was for real,'' Younger said, laughing.
``It just looked like, Here's that cheapskate Bush at it again,
trying to save money on his Christmas cards.''
 &HT;    But if Bush was a funny character with a pack of friends and a
fondness for good times, there was, by his own account and that of
his wife and friends, a problem with alcohol. He had drunk a lot
for years, and at times his boisterousness became downright
obnoxious: in one infamous incident, a well-lubricated Bush nearly
gave an old friend of his parents a heart attack at a cocktail
party, when he stumbled up to the matronly, elaborately dressed and
coiffed woman and said to her, ``So, what's sex like after 50,
anyway?''
 &HT;    In another incident, at the age of 26, he ran over a neighbor's
trash can and, according to a story that circulated in the 1994
campaign, challenged his perturbed father to go ``mano a mano''
when the senior Bush came out to inspect the damage. Bush now says
the story originated as a joking account by his mother, and has
been exaggerated.
 &HT;    ``It wasn't a fight,'' he said. ``It was an incident where I
drank too much, I believe was the background. It was kind of a
feisty guy talking to a father, and he kind of dismissed me, I
guess was what happened. I can't remember the exact words.''
 &HT;    Laura Bush says she wanted her husband to give up drinking, a
request she says she made not constantly, ``but every once in a
while, after some night that wasn't particularly great.'' Friends
say the marriage was seriously strained, though the governor denies
accounts by some that Laura gave him some sort of ultimatum.
 &HT;    ``Jack Daniels or the road?'' Bush said. ``I don't think so. I
don't remember that. No. She's a pretty patient person.''
 &HT;    In the end, Bush dealt with the problem in a characteristic way:
decisively, impulsively and without much evident introspection, at
least that he has shared publicly _ unlike, say, his predecessor,
former Texas Gov. Ann W. Richards, a dedicated member of Alcoholics
Anonymous who openly and widely discussed her problems with
alcohol.
 &HT;    On a summer night in 1986, spent with his wife and friends at
the Broadmoor resort in Colorado Springs in celebration of his and
some friends' 40th birthdays that year, Bush partied heartily. He
woke up with a raging hangover. To his stunned friends, he simply
began announcing that he had made a decision never to drink again.
 &HT;    It was a spontaneous pledge but one he has kept, Bush says. As
he put it to me a few years ago when I was preparing a story about
the contrasting ways in which he and Richards viewed
addiction-treatment programs in the state prison system (in sum, he
has much more faith in the cold-turkey approach): ``I quit for the
rest of my life and if you catch me drinking, it's not going to be
a good sign for your old buddy George.''
 &HT;    To this day, Bush says he does not know whether he is or was an
alcoholic. He thinks not, but he isn't really interested in
exploring the subject. ``I'm a high-energy person, and alcohol
competes with your energy,'' he said. ``It really does. So I
quit.''
 &HT;    During this time, Bush also got serious about the oil business,
prospering in the boom and skirting, like just about every other
oilman in Texas, financial ruin in the bust. His company merged
with another, struggled and in 1986 merged with the Harken Energy
Corp. of Irving, Texas, in a deal that gave him a financial
interest, directorship, consultancy and access to below-market
interest rates to buy more than $500,000 worth of stock.
 &HT;    With his father in the White House as vice president, George
W.'s break raised some eyebrows at the time, even more so when the
little-known Harken, which until that point had virtually no
experience in overseas exploration, won a lucrative contract to
drill for oil in Bahrain, in the Persian Gulf.
 &HT;    He also sold a large block of stock just before the company
announced poor quarterly earnings, raising questions of whether he
improperly used inside information. But George W. was never found
to have traded on his father's position to help the company nor
charged with any wrongdoing.

 &HT;    
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    By 1987, with his father set to launch a presidential campaign,
George W. Bush too was immersed in politics.
 &HT;    He spent months traipsing around Iowa and New Hampshire, making
contacts that actually may come in handy if he becomes _ as many
predict will be the case _ the Republican standard-bearer in 2000.
 &HT;    It was George W. who coordinated the job of making sure that
Bush loyalists were rewarded in the new administration.
 &HT;    But the younger Bush, expressing distaste for Washington and
perhaps with an eye on his own political future, moved back to
Dallas in 1989, getting involved in the venture he repeatedly
pointed to in his 1994 campaign for Texas governor as his signal
accomplishment: the new ballpark for the Rangers baseball team.
 &HT;    Part of a group that purchased 84 percent of the Rangers that
year for $86 million, Bush's own personal investment was barely
more than $600,000. He was made one of two managing partners, a
high-profile job that gave him frequent media exposure, at least on
the sports pages in Dallas and Fort Worth.
 &HT;    He was a constant presence at games, somewhat indelicately
explaining that he thought it important for ``folks to see me
sitting in the same seat they sit in, eating the same popcorn,
peeing in the same urinal.''
 &HT;    The major project during Bush's time with the club was the
planning and construction of the Ballpark in Arlington, one of the
new generation of old-fashioned baseball stadiums to which fans
have flocked in recent years. When he ran for governor in 1994 and
faced questions about his record (``eight games out of first,'' ran
the joke), Bush cited the park, more than a bit plaintively, as
proof of his ability to plan and execute big things.
 &HT;    ``My biggest liability in Texas is, What's the boy ever done?''
he told one paper. ``So he's got a famous father and ran a small
oil company. ... Now I can say I've done something. Here it is.''
To another, he explained: ``When all those people in Austin say,
'He ain't never done anything,' Well, this is it.''
 &HT;    The granite-and-brick Ballpark is indeed a thing of beauty, and
attendance at Rangers games soared. That the park was built with
the help of a voter-approved half-cent sales tax as well as with
eminent domain proceedings that generated local controversy has led
Bush's critics to suggest that his one self-described big thing is
curiously inconsistent with his conservative message.
 &HT;    ``Whether the public interest issue is taxes, size of
government, property rights or public subsidies of private sports
ventures,'' editorialized the liberal Texas Observer in a May 1997
article headlined ``Stealing Home,'' ``Bush's personal ownership in
the Texas Rangers baseball team has been wildly at odds with his
publicly declared positions on those issues.''
 &HT;    Whatever it says about his political philosophy, his relatively
small initial investment with the Rangers has turned out to be
immensely profitable, leading to recurring questions about whether
his corporate friends found a clever way to set him up financially
and thus free him up for politics.
 &HT;    Under his contract, his interest grew by an additional 10
percent as compensation for his service as managing partner. That
overall partnership merged with other investors and this year the
whole ownership was sold for $250 million, a deal netting Bush
$14.9 million.
 &HT;    Given the taxpayers' subsidy, this enormous profit has generated
criticism from State Land Commissioner Garry Mauro, Bush's
Democratic opponent, who calls it ``plain old corporate welfare.''
Bush said the ballpark is generating tax revenues that more than
offset the original sales-tax increase, and his office describes
the overall deal as a ``win-win'' situation for both Bush and
Arlington taxpayers.
 &HT;    Dissuading all other Republicans with his famous name and
powerful access to campaign funds, Bush got the gubernatorial
nomination in 1994 unopposed. It ventures far into the realm of
psychology to wonder just how much Bush was _ is _ motivated by
proving himself worthy of his famous name. While all this is
precisely the kind of ``psychobabble'' that both George Bushes
insist they don't indulge in anyway, John Ellis, his first cousin,
who lives in Boston, thinks it is ultimately off base.
 &HT;    ``I really think the opposite is true here,'' Ellis said. ``What
he was caught in for a long time was an 'I'll never be good enough,
I'll never be good enough' deal. At some point, though, he decided,
'I'll just take what I've got and we'll see what we can do with
that.' People will say he's running to prove something to the old
man, but the thing that really liberated him was the realization
that he didn't have to be his old man.''
 &HT;    As governor, Bush is a strong supporter of the death penalty and
has presided over a record number of executions, including that of
Karla Faye Tucker, the first woman put to death in Texas since the
Civil War and whose case sparked an international uproar earlier
this year. Bush's stance is broadly supported in Texas; it could
conceivably cause him problems in a general election in less
conservative states, though not, most likely, in the Republican
primaries.
 &HT;    And while other governors with an eye on the White House,
including those in Wisconsin and Michigan, have devised sweeping
job-training programs aimed at getting recipients off welfare,
Texas lags in that area, in large part because its welfare payments
are so low that there is little money available for such
approaches.
 &HT;    Bush applies the following spin to the state's relatively
minuscule welfare stipends: ``If you're trying to move people from
welfare to work,'' he says, ``that's exactly where you want your
payments to be.''
 &HT;    During his years as governor, Bush has grown far more
comfortable on the hustings. He is capable of moving an audience
with words like this: ``Today's challenge lies not so much outside
our borders as inside our souls.'' And he can make them laugh, as
when he cites his travails as the father of twin teen-age
daughters, Barbara and Jenna.
 &HT;    ``No one warned me!'' he says in mock horror. ``There are not
enough DPS officers in Austin to protect my fellow Texans from
these new drivers.''
 &HT;    Around the Capitol, his style is jocular and informal, and he is
not exactly known as a policy wonk. It is not lost on visitors that
his office is lined with cases full of baseballs, not books.
Meetings with Bush do not drag on into the wee hours.
 &HT;    ``Like a lot of great leaders,'' State Sen. Teel Bivins, a
Republican from Amarillo, jokingly says, ``he has about a 20-second
attention span. He listens to your issues, analyzes, gets to the
heart of them, makes a decision, gets bored and is ready to move
on.''
 &HT;    Everywhere he goes, the governor is asked if he will run for
Dad's old job. He says he genuinely does not know. ``The bubble,''
he says, summarizing what he calls the case against going for it
all. ``It's the perpetual bubble. It's not a one-time bubble. It's
life.''
 &HT;    Or, as Laura Bush cheerfully puts it: ``It's sort of a stretch
for me, because I could just as soon, you know, hang around and
work in the yard.''
 &HT;    Bush says that if he runs, it will be because he has a clear and
compelling idea in his mind of where he wants to take the nation _
and not because he wants to avenge his father's defeat in 1992.
``You can't lead people from a pessimistic or revengeful point of
view,'' he says.
 &HT;    The general consensus among the governor's friends is that,
inevitably, he will run. It's in the family's blood. If Bush does
run, he is likely to encounter little trouble finding money. He is
already generating huge amounts from out of state. (Nearly half of
his most recent four-month haul of $4.4 million came from outside
Texas.)
 &HT;    There is certainly a case to be made against George Bush. There
are entire realms of policy _ such as, say, foreign policy _ that
he has simply never dealt with. Albert R. Hunt, a Wall Street
Journal columnist, recently observed that that Bush would be the
Republicans' ``most inexperienced nominee since Wendell Willkie in
1940.''
 &HT;    As the nomination fight gets under way, Bush is unlikely to
start off with the firm blessing of the religious right. ``I don't
think that George W. Bush would be the favored candidate of the
religious right under any circumstances _ he's far too moderate for
them,'' said John C. Green, a professor at the University of Akron
and an expert on the religious right in American politics. ``He
could be their second choice, or their third or fourth or fifth.
That's the big question.''
 &HT;    The governor does have an important bridge to at least one
faction of religious conservatives: not the militantly
rather-be-right-than-be-president set, but the more pragmatic wing
embodied by Ralph Reed, the former executive director of the
Christian Coalition and current political strategist, with whom
Bush talks frequently.
 &HT;    Many Republicans think Reed is likely to settle on Bush as a
candidate who can advance at least part of the agenda of religious
conservatives _ and actually win a general election. On the record,
Reed would say only that the Republican Party is likely to have
``an embarrassment of riches, a heck of a lot of great candidates
out there'' in 2000.
 &HT;    There is also the question of groundwork. A spokesman for Lamar
Alexander, for instance, notes that the former Tennessee governor,
who ran in 1996 and plans to do so again in 2000, has spent an
average of a few days every month in both Iowa and New Hampshire
these past few years. Since becoming governor, Bush has literally
not set foot in either state. That may mean a great deal, but then
again, it may not.
 &HT;    ``What someone like Lamar Alexander could do with 1,000 lobster
dinners in New Hampshire, someone like George Bush could walk in
and do on the first day,'' says Alex Castellanos, a Republican

 &HT;    
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    By 1987, with his father set to launch a presidential campaign,
George W. Bush too was immersed in politics.
 &HT;    He spent months traipsing around Iowa and New Hampshire, making
contacts that actually may come in handy if he becomes _ as many
predict will be the case _ the Republican standard-bearer in 2000.
 &HT;    It was George W. who coordinated the job of making sure that
Bush loyalists were rewarded in the new administration.
 &HT;    But the younger Bush, expressing distaste for Washington and
perhaps with an eye on his own political future, moved back to
Dallas in 1989, getting involved in the venture he repeatedly
pointed to in his 1994 campaign for Texas governor as his signal
accomplishment: the new ballpark for the Rangers baseball team.
 &HT;    Part of a group that purchased 84 percent of the Rangers that
year for $86 million, Bush's own personal investment was barely
more than $600,000. He was made one of two managing partners, a
high-profile job that gave him frequent media exposure, at least on
the sports pages in Dallas and Fort Worth.
 &HT;    He was a constant presence at games, somewhat indelicately
explaining that he thought it important for ``folks to see me
sitting in the same seat they sit in, eating the same popcorn,
peeing in the same urinal.''
 &HT;    The major project during Bush's time with the club was the
planning and construction of the Ballpark in Arlington, one of the
new generation of old-fashioned baseball stadiums to which fans
have flocked in recent years. When he ran for governor in 1994 and
faced questions about his record (``eight games out of first,'' ran
the joke), Bush cited the park, more than a bit plaintively, as
proof of his ability to plan and execute big things.
 &HT;    ``My biggest liability in Texas is, What's the boy ever done?''
he told one paper. ``So he's got a famous father and ran a small
oil company. ... Now I can say I've done something. Here it is.''
To another, he explained: ``When all those people in Austin say,
'He ain't never done anything,' Well, this is it.''
 &HT;    The granite-and-brick Ballpark is indeed a thing of beauty, and
attendance at Rangers games soared. That the park was built with
the help of a voter-approved half-cent sales tax as well as with
eminent domain proceedings that generated local controversy has led
Bush's critics to suggest that his one self-described big thing is
curiously inconsistent with his conservative message.
 &HT;    ``Whether the public interest issue is taxes, size of
government, property rights or public subsidies of private sports
ventures,'' editorialized the liberal Texas Observer in a May 1997
article headlined ``Stealing Home,'' ``Bush's personal ownership in
the Texas Rangers baseball team has been wildly at odds with his
publicly declared positions on those issues.''
 &HT;    Whatever it says about his political philosophy, his relatively
small initial investment with the Rangers has turned out to be
immensely profitable, leading to recurring questions about whether
his corporate friends found a clever way to set him up financially
and thus free him up for politics.
 &HT;    Under his contract, his interest grew by an additional 10
percent as compensation for his service as managing partner. That
overall partnership merged with other investors and this year the
whole ownership was sold for $250 million, a deal netting Bush
$14.9 million.
 &HT;    Given the taxpayers' subsidy, this enormous profit has generated
criticism from State Land Commissioner Garry Mauro, Bush's
Democratic opponent, who calls it ``plain old corporate welfare.''
Bush said the ballpark is generating tax revenues that more than
offset the original sales-tax increase, and his office describes
the overall deal as a ``win-win'' situation for both Bush and
Arlington taxpayers.
 &HT;    Dissuading all other Republicans with his famous name and
powerful access to campaign funds, Bush got the gubernatorial
nomination in 1994 unopposed. It ventures far into the realm of
psychology to wonder just how much Bush was _ is _ motivated by
proving himself worthy of his famous name. While all this is
precisely the kind of ``psychobabble'' that both George Bushes
insist they don't indulge in anyway, John Ellis, his first cousin,
who lives in Boston, thinks it is ultimately off base.
 &HT;    ``I really think the opposite is true here,'' Ellis said. ``What
he was caught in for a long time was an 'I'll never be good enough,
I'll never be good enough' deal. At some point, though, he decided,
'I'll just take what I've got and we'll see what we can do with
that.' People will say he's running to prove something to the old
man, but the thing that really liberated him was the realization
that he didn't have to be his old man.''
 &HT;    As governor, Bush is a strong supporter of the death penalty and
has presided over a record number of executions, including that of
Karla Faye Tucker, the first woman put to death in Texas since the
Civil War and whose case sparked an international uproar earlier
this year. Bush's stance is broadly supported in Texas; it could
conceivably cause him problems in a general election in less
conservative states, though not, most likely, in the Republican
primaries.
 &HT;    And while other governors with an eye on the White House,
including those in Wisconsin and Michigan, have devised sweeping
job-training programs aimed at getting recipients off welfare,
Texas lags in that area, in large part because its welfare payments
are so low that there is little money available for such
approaches.
 &HT;    Bush applies the following spin to the state's relatively
minuscule welfare stipends: ``If you're trying to move people from
welfare to work,'' he says, ``that's exactly where you want your
payments to be.''
 &HT;    During his years as governor, Bush has grown far more
comfortable on the hustings. He is capable of moving an audience
with words like this: ``Today's challenge lies not so much outside
our borders as inside our souls.'' And he can make them laugh, as
when he cites his travails as the father of twin teen-age
daughters, Barbara and Jenna.
 &HT;    ``No one warned me!'' he says in mock horror. ``There are not
enough DPS officers in Austin to protect my fellow Texans from
these new drivers.''
 &HT;    Around the Capitol, his style is jocular and informal, and he is
not exactly known as a policy wonk. It is not lost on visitors that
his office is lined with cases full of baseballs, not books.
Meetings with Bush do not drag on into the wee hours.
 &HT;    ``Like a lot of great leaders,'' State Sen. Teel Bivins, a
Republican from Amarillo, jokingly says, ``he has about a 20-second
attention span. He listens to your issues, analyzes, gets to the
heart of them, makes a decision, gets bored and is ready to move
on.''
 &HT;    Everywhere he goes, the governor is asked if he will run for
Dad's old job. He says he genuinely does not know. ``The bubble,''
he says, summarizing what he calls the case against going for it
all. ``It's the perpetual bubble. It's not a one-time bubble. It's
life.''
 &HT;    Or, as Laura Bush cheerfully puts it: ``It's sort of a stretch
for me, because I could just as soon, you know, hang around and
work in the yard.''
 &HT;    Bush says that if he runs, it will be because he has a clear and
compelling idea in his mind of where he wants to take the nation _
and not because he wants to avenge his father's defeat in 1992.
``You can't lead people from a pessimistic or revengeful point of
view,'' he says.
 &HT;    The general consensus among the governor's friends is that,
inevitably, he will run. It's in the family's blood. If Bush does
run, he is likely to encounter little trouble finding money. He is
already generating huge amounts from out of state. (Nearly half of
his most recent four-month haul of $4.4 million came from outside
Texas.)
 &HT;    There is certainly a case to be made against George Bush. There
are entire realms of policy _ such as, say, foreign policy _ that
he has simply never dealt with. Albert R. Hunt, a Wall Street
Journal columnist, recently observed that that Bush would be the
Republicans' ``most inexperienced nominee since Wendell Willkie in
1940.''
 &HT;    As the nomination fight gets under way, Bush is unlikely to
start off with the firm blessing of the religious right. ``I don't
think that George W. Bush would be the favored candidate of the
religious right under any circumstances _ he's far too moderate for
them,'' said John C. Green, a professor at the University of Akron
and an expert on the religious right in American politics. ``He
could be their second choice, or their third or fourth or fifth.
That's the big question.''
 &HT;    The governor does have an important bridge to at least one
faction of religious conservatives: not the militantly
rather-be-right-than-be-president set, but the more pragmatic wing
embodied by Ralph Reed, the former executive director of the
Christian Coalition and current political strategist, with whom
Bush talks frequently.
 &HT;    Many Republicans think Reed is likely to settle on Bush as a
candidate who can advance at least part of the agenda of religious
conservatives _ and actually win a general election. On the record,
Reed would say only that the Republican Party is likely to have
``an embarrassment of riches, a heck of a lot of great candidates
out there'' in 2000.
 &HT;    There is also the question of groundwork. A spokesman for Lamar
Alexander, for instance, notes that the former Tennessee governor,
who ran in 1996 and plans to do so again in 2000, has spent an
average of a few days every month in both Iowa and New Hampshire
these past few years. Since becoming governor, Bush has literally
not set foot in either state. That may mean a great deal, but then
again, it may not.
 &HT;    ``What someone like Lamar Alexander could do with 1,000 lobster
dinners in New Hampshire, someone like George Bush could walk in
and do on the first day,'' says Alex Castellanos, a Republican
consultant. ``Because he's not George W. Smith. He's George W.
Bush.''

 WILD YOUNG '60s GUY JUMPS INTO MARRIAGE, BUSINESS and POLITICS

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    There is something potentially incongruous about George W. Bush
as the self-described promoter of ``a responsibility era.'' As one
who seems to have indulged freely in his past, Bush now routinely
lectures high-schoolers to ``abstain from sex until you've found
the person you want to marry.''
 &HT;    And when Bush stepped ever so gingerly into the White House sex
scandal, saying recently he felt ``embarrassed for the country,''
Lanny J. Davis, a Clinton adviser, leapt in with a response. Noting
that he had been at Yale with Bush, Davis said on national
television that the governor ``shouldn't throw stones.''
 &HT;    On the other hand, Bush's message is reflective of the country
at large. He is, after all, just one of countless tens of thousands
of parents who came of age in the 1960s and are now saying much the
same thing to their kids.
 &HT;    In a generally laudatory piece about Bush's campaign for values
in this summer's edition of City Journal, a publication of the
conservative Manhattan Institute, Tucker Carlson suggested that
Bush may in fact be the perfect spokesman for ``the politics of
virtue.''
 &HT;    ``Before his marriage, Bush had a reputation (from all accounts,
deserved) as something of a wild man,'' Carlson wrote. ``When he
speaks, it is as a grizzled veteran of the sexual revolution. But
he is a changed man.''
 &HT;    In a two-and-a-half-page letter, with responses to a series of
questions I posed for this article, President Bush (he declined to
be interviewed) made a point of dismissing the notion that his son
ever seriously lost his way in any of these years.
 &HT;    ``I asked Barbara to read this letter,'' the president wrote.
``She asked me to add that, like me, she never felt George was a
problem _ that he never had trouble 'finding himself.' She
believes, as I do, that 'the wild young man' thesis is greatly
overblown.
 &HT;    ``George really never had trouble 'finding himself,''' Bush
added in the next paragraph. ``He had some happy times, but none of
this 'worried' Barbara and me. He never lost his bearing. He always
came home.''
 &HT;    In 1973, George W. Bush decided he wanted to become serious
about a business career, and he entered Harvard Business School.
Two years later, driving a 1970 Cutlass, he retraced a famous
journey to West Texas his father made in 1948, and headed back
south and west toward dusty Midland. True, given his family
contacts, this was hardly a journey into the great unknown.
 &HT;    Bush's plan was to jump into the oil business, but before long
he was jumping into other things as well: marriage and politics. In
1977, he married Laura Welch, a librarian and schoolteacher from
Midland who is, by wide agreement, a crucial influence in both the
governor's personal transformation and his political success.
 &HT;    With a down-to-earth style, an infectious sense of humor and
campaigns reminiscent of her mother-in-law's, for breast-cancer
awareness and literacy, she is wildly popular in Texas.
 &HT;    Having rarely even been in the area for a decade before his
return, Bush made a brash decision when the 44-year incumbent
Democratic congressman, George Mahon, announced his retirement that
same year. At the age of 31, Bush declared for the seat, and he and
Laura were off on what they call their extended honeymoon.
 &HT;    ``We had a really great time,'' recalls Laura Bush with a hearty
laugh, during an interview at the Governor's Mansion in Austin.
``It was a great way to spend the first year of marriage. We drove
up and down the Panhandle of Texas, from Hereford to Midland.''
 &HT;    In that campaign, Bush got his first taste of themes that
plagued his father's own races in Texas, which included two losing
bids for the U.S. Senate. George W.'s Democratic opponent, Kent
Hance, now a friend and supporter, cleverly played up Bush's
prep-school, Ivy League credentials, which didn't exactly go over
big in rough-and-tumble places such as Odessa.
 &HT;    With his father serving on international boards such as the
Rockefeller-financed Trilateral Commission, the candidate found
himself hectored by groups who said he too was surely a tool of the
New World Order. He finally had to go on record with his opposition
to ``one-world government and one monetary system.''
 &HT;    ``And if the Trilateral Commission supports those things,'' he
explained at the time, ``I'm sure my father is a dissenting
voice.''
 &HT;    Bush lost and, any political aspirations of his own put on hold
for the next decade and a half, he burrowed into the oil business,
founding an exploration company and digging into mineral records.
He was still known as a big party guy, and his friends gave him no
end of a hard time about being both a tightwad and a notoriously
sloppy dresser.
 &HT;    ``George would wear anything anyone would give him,'' said Dr.
Charles Younger, an orthopedic surgeon in Midland and a longtime
friend.
 &HT;    As the holiday season approached one year, his friends all got
together and collected a sheaf of tacky corporate Christmas cards
from West Texas oil firms, then conspicuously crossed out the
company name under the greeting and replaced it with ``Merry
Christmas, from George and Laura Bush.''
 &HT;    ``The funny thing is, I think at least half the people who got
them probably thought it was for real,'' Younger said, laughing.
``It just looked like, Here's that cheapskate Bush at it again,
trying to save money on his Christmas cards.''
 &HT;    But if Bush was a funny character with a pack of friends and a
fondness for good times, there was, by his own account and that of
his wife and friends, a problem with alcohol. He had drunk a lot
for years, and at times his boisterousness became downright
obnoxious: in one infamous incident, a well-lubricated Bush nearly
gave an old friend of his parents a heart attack at a cocktail
party, when he stumbled up to the matronly, elaborately dressed and
coiffed woman and said to her, ``So, what's sex like after 50,
anyway?''
 &HT;    In another incident, at the age of 26, he ran over a neighbor's
trash can and, according to a story that circulated in the 1994
campaign, challenged his perturbed father to go ``mano a mano''
when the senior Bush came out to inspect the damage. Bush now says
the story originated as a joking account by his mother, and has
been exaggerated.
 &HT;    ``It wasn't a fight,'' he said. ``It was an incident where I
drank too much, I believe was the background. It was kind of a
feisty guy talking to a father, and he kind of dismissed me, I
guess was what happened. I can't remember the exact words.''
 &HT;    Laura Bush says she wanted her husband to give up drinking, a
request she says she made not constantly, ``but every once in a
while, after some night that wasn't particularly great.'' Friends
say the marriage was seriously strained, though the governor denies
accounts by some that Laura gave him some sort of ultimatum.
 &HT;    ``Jack Daniels or the road?'' Bush said. ``I don't think so. I
don't remember that. No. She's a pretty patient person.''
 &HT;    In the end, Bush dealt with the problem in a characteristic way:
decisively, impulsively and without much evident introspection, at
least that he has shared publicly _ unlike, say, his predecessor,
former Texas Gov. Ann W. Richards, a dedicated member of Alcoholics
Anonymous who openly and widely discussed her problems with
alcohol.
 &HT;    On a summer night in 1986, spent with his wife and friends at
the Broadmoor resort in Colorado Springs in celebration of his and
some friends' 40th birthdays that year, Bush partied heartily. He
woke up with a raging hangover. To his stunned friends, he simply
began announcing that he had made a decision never to drink again.
 &HT;    It was a spontaneous pledge but one he has kept, Bush says. As
he put it to me a few years ago when I was preparing a story about
the contrasting ways in which he and Richards viewed
addiction-treatment programs in the state prison system (in sum, he
has much more faith in the cold-turkey approach): ``I quit for the
rest of my life and if you catch me drinking, it's not going to be
a good sign for your old buddy George.''
 &HT;    To this day, Bush says he does not know whether he is or was an
alcoholic. He thinks not, but he isn't really interested in
exploring the subject. ``I'm a high-energy person, and alcohol
competes with your energy,'' he said. ``It really does. So I
quit.''
 &HT;    During this time, Bush also got serious about the oil business,
prospering in the boom and skirting, like just about every other
oilman in Texas, financial ruin in the bust. His company merged
with another, struggled and in 1986 merged with the Harken Energy
Corp. of Irving, Texas, in a deal that gave him a financial
interest, directorship, consultancy and access to below-market
interest rates to buy more than $500,000 worth of stock.
 &HT;    With his father in the White House as vice president, George
W.'s break raised some eyebrows at the time, even more so when the
little-known Harken, which until that point had virtually no
experience in overseas exploration, won a lucrative contract to
drill for oil in Bahrain, in the Persian Gulf.
 &HT;    He also sold a large block of stock just before the company
announced poor quarterly earnings, raising questions of whether he
improperly used inside information. But George W. was never found
to have traded on his father's position to help the company nor
charged with any wrongdoing.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    George W. Bush, the governor of Texas, likes to say that the
fundamental difference between him and his father is that the
former president attended Greenwich Country Day School, while he
went to San Jacinto Junior High School in Midland, Texas.
 &HT;    Born in 1946 in New Haven, George and Barbara Bush's first
child, young ``Georgie'' was along for the famous journey when his
father struck out for West Texas in a 1947 Studebaker.
 &HT;    He was a mischievous boy with a passion for sports, especially
baseball, and a penchant for wisecracks that may well have its
origins in a family tragedy. George was 7 years old when his
sister, Robin, 3, died of leukemia, and both of his parents told
friends that George seemed to develop a joking, bantering style in
a determined bid to lift them from their grief. (There are five
Bush children, four sons and a surviving daughter.)
 &HT;    He did spend many formative years in Midland, and attended the
public schools there. But while his identity as a Texan has never
been mocked to the degree his father's was, the younger Bush has
preppy credentials that parallel those of his father. He went to
Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., and to Yale University. In
fact, much of Bush's life seems to be a slightly eerie, and not
always successful, bid to retrace the footsteps of the famous
father.
 &HT;    ``You have to really understand how much his father was loved
and respected by so many people to understand what it would be like
to grow up as a namesake, the son of George Bush, `` said George W.
Bush's first cousin, John Ellis, a Boston-based marketing and
advertising consultant who is close to the governor.
 &HT;    ``There are all these parallels in his life. 'He went to
Andover, went to Yale, went to West Texas, ran for Congress, and at
every stage of that he was found wanting. To go through every stage
of life and be found wanting and know that people find you wanting,
that's a real grind.''
 &HT;    To Bush's critics, his prolonged rowdy days and his
unspectacular early career make his later political success _ in
which simply having the name ``George Bush'' was undeniably a
crucial, perhaps THE crucial, element _ all the more irritating,
and undeserved. But in Ellis' view, his cousin's later
achievements, which came after his marriage and his decision to
quit drinking, are all the more impressive in light of the wayward
years.
 &HT;    ``He gathered it together,'' said Ellis. ``George was on the
road to nowhere at 40. At the age of 52, he's the front-runner for
the Republican presidential nomination. That's a pretty incredible
turnaround.''
 &HT;    Bush himself does not deny that he is a classic late bloomer; he
refers to the ``nomadic years'' of his youth and once explained he
``kind of floated and saw a lot of life'' throughout his 20s. He
even jokes about all this, though one wonders if the stand-up
monologue he delivered to a howling audience this past winter at
Washington's elite Alfalfa Club, with his father present, had just
a tinge of bitter truth to it.
 &HT;    ``Can you imagine how much it hurt,'' said George Walker Bush,
``to know that Dad's idea of the perfect son was'' _ and then he
paused before delivering the line that brought down the house _
``Al Gore?''
 &HT;    At Yale, just like his father, Bush was in the secretive Skull
and Bones club. He was president of his fraternity, Delta Kappa
Epsilon, though, as a less-than-diligent student, he did not follow
the old man into Phi Beta Kappa. In any event, he says he did not
like a lot of the ``intellectual arrogance'' and ''snobs'' at Yale,
and he cites one incident as particularly galling.
 &HT;    Several months after his father lost the 1964 Texas Senate
campaign to Ralph Yarborough, the incumbent Democratic populist,
Bush said he met Yale's prominent campus chaplain.
 &HT;    ``I ran into William Sloane Coffin, who was the preacher at
Yale, supposedly the guy that was there to comfort students,'' the
governor said. ``I introduced myself and he said, Yeah, I know your
father, and your father lost to a better man.''
 &HT;    Even today, 33 years later, Bush is clearly offended by the
statement, and it is one of the many reasons, he says, that he
couldn't wait to get back to Texas, after his graduation in 1968:
``Texas people are more polite. I don't think a Texan would do that
to a son.''
 &HT;    When Bush talks about his father, this is not the only trace of
bitterness. Victory in the Persian Gulf War, he told Texas Monthly,
was ``one of the great achievements of the 20th century, and it had
a shelf life of about a month.'' He is also still bothered, as he
later puts it in an interview, by the ``factors that caused this
good man to get defeated.''
 &HT;    And he raises at least one that could well resurface in some
fashion: ``Patrick J. Buchanan handing the baton, the proverbial
political knife, off to Ross Perot _ the kind of isolationism and
nativism and very harsh attacks against George Bush. You die a
death of a thousand cuts in the political process.''
 &HT;    George the younger obviously loves and reveres his father, and
he has plenty of characteristics _ the impish half-grin, the chop
in the air, the passion for foods that gross out some of his staff
(bologna sandwiches, in his case) _ that strikingly betray his
genes.
 &HT;    And yet, President Bush has been curiously absent from his son's
campaigns and oratory. Barbara Bush shows up much more often. One
of the governor's stock campaign jokes involves going to get his
hair cut, and having the barber marvel: ``I can't believe I'm
cutting the hair of the son of Barbara Bush.''
 &HT;    Partly, the governor simply wants to be seen as his own man _
not ``just another rich son of a Bush,'' as the Texas populist Jim
Hightower describes him. And for his part, the president ``almost
makes it a point not to advise him too much, on the theory that
people would say, 'Hey, you're just Daddy's boy,' `` said George
Strake, a former Republican state chairman in Texas and a Bush
family friend.
 &HT;    But there is clearly another undercurrent here. While President
Bush remains personally popular with Americans, any prominent role
in a national campaign could resurrect the ambivalence many
Republicans felt about him. And it could lead to questions about
just how his son differs from him politically, if at all.
 &HT;    Neither Bush nor his top aides will even take much of a stab at
that. (One, insisting he not be quoted by name, offered this
thought: ``I think the father was more of a noblesse oblige
politician, while George W. Bush is a conviction politician.''
Hardly a comparison to flatter the old man.)
 &HT;    President and Mrs. Bush declined requests for an interview for
this story. But a couple of weeks ago, a two-and-a-half-page letter
from Kennebunkport came whirring across my fax machine, a response
to a series of written questions.
 &HT;    In it, President Bush wrote of the ``enormous pride'' he felt as
he watched two of his sons make their way in public life. ``Both
Jeb and George were at my side in some pretty tough times,'' he
said, ``and they know firsthand what Teddy Roosevelt's `Arena' is
really like. I hope they never say, 'It's not worth it.'''
 &HT;    The former president said he was reluctant to speak out on
issues these days, ''because I don't want some reporter from
Washington rushing down to one of our sons after I stake out a
position on an issue saying: 'Your Dad says so and so. ... Why
don't you agree?'
 &HT;    ``I had my chance,'' Bush continued. ``Now it is their time and
I am determined to stay out of the way. To support them where they
want me to. But not to inadvertently cause complications for
them.''
 &HT;    George W. Bush knows that if he runs, everybody will be asking
questions about his relationship with his father. ``Doonesbury''
has already given the governor his cartoon identity: a junior-size
point of light. The governor says he's neither concerned nor
interested. ``These are the kind of psychological analyses that I'm
not really thrilled about talking about,'' he explains. ``It's not
my thing.
 &HT;    ``You occasionally read about, 'Well, he must prove himself''' _
the governor draws out the words with a theatrical flair _ ```to be
different from his father.' The voice is out of Washington, and the
Echo Chamber. `Well, he must distinguish himself''' _ more emphasis
_ ```from his father.' Well, therein lies the dilemma. But I don't
listen to them. Because all I've got to do is be myself.
 &HT;    ``By being myself I will distinguish myself from my father,
because we're two separately different people. I've got half my
mother in me and half my father in me, which is a pretty
interesting combination.''
 &HT;    When George W. got back to Texas in 1968, he joined the Texas
Air National Guard and for five years spent some weekends and
longer stints flying fighter jets. His unit was never called for
service in the Vietnam War, and by enlisting in the guard, he was
automatically removed as a candidate for the military draft, an
issue that flared briefly in the 1994 gubernatorial campaign and
undoubtedly would again in a national race.
 &HT;    In 1992, gearing up for his Texas campaign, Bush told The New
York Times that while he was prepared to serve, he had trouble
remembering what his position was on the war when he was in
college. While that may sound implausible, people who knew him at
the time said that Bush indeed showed virtually no interest in
public policy, or politics.
 &HT;    It seems inconceivable, for instance, that he could ever have
written anyone a letter brooding over how to ``maintain my
political viability within the system,'' to use the memorable
phrase from a 1969 letter sent by a young man named Bill Clinton,
born the month after George W. Bush, to the director of the
University of Arkansas' Reserve Officers Training Corps program.
 &HT;    What most seems to have marked the decade after Bush graduated
from college was his wandering, carousing nature. He held a series
of jobs, working on an offshore rig and (miserably) for an
agricultural firm, and mentoring inner-city youth in Houston.
 &HT;    But he was best known as a major-league partygoer, often seen
driving around town in his Triumph and in the company of attractive
young women.
 &HT;    As governor, Bush has clearly succeeded in drawing a rather huge
zone of privacy around the question of just how wild his wild days
were. He declines to answer specific questions about matters such
as drug use.
 &HT;    ``There were things I did that were mistakes,'' he said. ``But I
think inventorying mistakes is a mistake. I think they send wrong
signals. I think they undermine the message.
 &HT;    ``I'd be the first to admit that I did irresponsible things when
I was young and irresponsible,'' he continued. ``I've assumed the
mantle of being a governor and a father in a responsible way, and
the signal we ought to send to our children is that in spite of
what happened in the '60s and '70s, we have learned some lessons.
And the lesson ought to be, don't be using drugs and alcohol. Learn
the lessons from the past.''

 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 NOTE: Full-length article (8,600 words) available on request  
 &HT;    George Walker Bush was visiting his parents in the White House
one day when the talk turned to religion, which is precisely the
subject that some powerful factions in the Republican Party want
their presidential standard-bearer to talk about, forcefully, in
2000.
 &HT;    But Bush, sitting one day recently on a sofa in the governor's
office at the Texas State Capitol, says he is ``cautious about
wearing my religion on my sleeve in the political process.'' And he
offers this particular story to explain why.
 &HT;    ``Mother and I were arguing _ not arguing, having a discussion _
and discussing who goes to Heaven,'' recalls the governor, who at
the time had religion very much on his mind.
 &HT;    Having dealt with a gathering drinking problem by abruptly
swearing off alcohol, he had vowed a renewed commitment to his
family and his faith. Bush pointed to the Bible: Only Christians
had a place in heaven.
 &HT;    ``I said, Mom, look, all I can tell you is what the New
Testament says. And she said, well, surely, God will accept others.
And I said, Mom, here's what the New Testament says. And she said,
OK, and she picks up the phone and calls Billy Graham. She says to
the White House operator, Get me Billy Graham.
 &HT;    ``I said, Mother, what are you doing?'' Bush continues,
chuckling at the memory. ``Seriously. And about two minutes later,
the phone rings, and it's Billy Graham, and Mother and I are on the
phone with Billy. And Mother explains the circumstances, and Billy
says, From a personal perspective, I agree with what George is
saying, the New Testament has been my guide. But I want to caution
you both. Don't play God. Who are you two to be God?''
 &HT;    For George W. Bush, a man who, in large part because of his
famous name, shows up in most polls these days as the very early
front-runner for a Republican presidential nomination battle that
is still more than a year away, it is an interesting story to
choose to relate.
 &HT;    Bush says it explains in part why he urged an end to ``name
calling'' this summer when a fracas broke out over his party's
decision to bar a gay Republican group from setting up a booth at
the GOP state convention.
 &HT;    ``There are some great admonitions in the Bible, talking about,
you know, don't try to take the speck out of your neighbor's eye
when you've got a log in your own,'' Bush says. ``I'm mindful of
that.''
 &HT;    And in his nearly four years as governor of the nation's
second-largest state, there has been strikingly little name-calling
from Bush. He talks constantly about being a ``unifier, not a
divider,'' and few things seem to make him happier than forging a
bipartisan consensus on some big bill.
 &HT;    He has grown so close to some Democratic lawmakers that he once
said there was ``no way in the world'' he could bring himself to
campaign against them.
 &HT;    Running now for his own re-election, Bush campaigns ferociously
in Democratic strongholds such as El Paso, where he breaks into
near-fluent Spanish before a delighted crowd at a ''Viva Bush!''
rally and where the Democratic mayor, Carlos Ramirez, introduces
him as ``the best governor of Texas that El Paso has ever had.''
 &HT;    For these and many other reasons, the 52-year-old eldest son of
former President George Bush is riding a broad wave of popularity
that, if current polls hold true, will carry him to a sweeping
victory this November as the first governor re-elected in Texas in
24 years, the first ever elected to back-to-back four-year terms.
 &HT;    Already, more than 100 Democratic officeholders have endorsed
him, including the state's lieutenant governor, a gruff political
veteran named Bob Bullock, who announced his support for Bush's
re-election even though he is godfather to the daughter of Bush's
Democratic opponent, Garry Mauro, the state land commissioner.
 &HT;    But if all this bodes well for Bush's re-election prospects in
Texas, and arguably for his prospects as a national candidate in a
general election, it also raises some obvious and perhaps
treacherous questions for the governor.
 &HT;    These are questions he would surely find tossed at him by
primary opponents if, in a step he is widely expected to take, he
runs for his father's old job. Just why do all those Democrats like
him so much? What kind of a Republican is he?
 &HT;    Why, for example, have some of his fiercest battles been with
his fellow Republicans? Some, including the state chairman of his
party at the time, are still furious with the governor over a tax
proposal he devised that would have radically reshaped the state
tax system, providing more money for some of the poorest public
schools in part by slapping new taxes on some of the biggest
industries.
 &HT;    Reticent on abortion, disinclined to denounce homosexuals, a
self-described fiscal conservative who is willing to spend money on
new programs such as a huge public-school reading initiative, Bush
does not seem to be offering the orthodoxy that some Republican
conservatives insist will be necessary in the party's candidate in
2000.
 &HT;    For all the speculation right now over whether Bush will want to
run for president _ speculation that has only seemed to grow more
fevered as scandal engulfs President Bill Clinton and threatens
Vice President Al Gore, the Democrat with the most obvious
presidential ambitions _ the more intriguing question may in time
turn out to be whether today's Republican Party wants someone like
Bush as its nominee.
 &HT;    Many party foot soldiers, still angry over the way they feel the
1996 nominee, Bob Dole, essentially ignored abortion, school prayer
and other issues they care most about, are determined to find a
candidate who will carry the torch _ or else. Many use Dole's name
as a verb, and not in a nice way _ ``We won't get Doled again,''
they say.
 &HT;    Bush insists that he is a cultural conservative and promotes
what he calls ``the responsibility era.'' But candidates are
already lining up to his right, including the deep-pocketed Steve
Forbes, the flat-tax fanatic of 1996 who this time around is making
an all-out pitch to social conservatives.
 &HT;    Forbes describes a ban on the procedure known as partial-birth
abortion as his foremost priority, ``the first step toward putting
abortion on the road to ultimate extinction in the United States of
America.''
 &HT;    Bush describes himself as ``pro-life,'' supports the
partial-birth abortion ban and pledges to propose a bill next year
requiring parental consent for a minor's abortion _ ``issues over
which we can make a difference,'' he says.
 &HT;    But on the basic question of the right of most women in most
circumstances to obtain an abortion, his position is that the
Supreme Court has already settled the law. And, to date, he has not
pledged any kind of crusade to sweep away those rulings; whether he
might do so in the heat of a primary campaign remains an open
question.
 &HT;    The Bush balancing act will be infinitely tougher to sustain in
the glare of the national stage. And how odd it seems, at least to
some, that so many Republicans might look to a man named George
Bush as their savior, given that George Bush lost it all for the
party just six years ago.
 -0- 
 &HT;    President Bush was at a steakhouse in Council Bluffs, Iowa, one
October day in 1994, reminiscing with some supporters from the old
days, when he excused himself to take a cellular telephone call.
The father was intently following the progress of two of his sons,
George and Jeb, in their respective gubernatorial campaigns against
savvy Democratic veterans in Texas and Florida, and new poll
numbers were just in.
 &HT;    ``He came back and he said, It looks like Jeb's OK, but I'm
worried about George,'' recalled Gordon C. James, a member of the
White House advance team in the Bush administration. ``He was upset
about it.''
 &HT;    Both races looked close, but like a lot of people, the president
saw evidence that Jeb (a nickname John Ellis Bush takes from his
initials) would pull it out over Lawton Chiles and that George's
race against a popular incumbent, Ann W. Richards, was just too
uphill a fight.
 &HT;    As things turned out, though, some invisible law of political
primogeniture seemed to kick in _ the older brother won and the
younger did not. (Late this summer, however, while George W. is
cruising toward re-election, Jeb is, according to the polls,
comfortably ahead too in his second bid for the governor's Mansion
in Tallahassee.)
 &HT;    Back in 1994, in seeing the softer-spoken, genial Jeb as the
more likely success in politics, people in the Bush family were
relying on much more than polling data. It's not that George W.
wasn't as determined to win as any Bush.
 &HT;    ``I think the major word to describe George W. circa 1993 and
the governorship was competitiveness,'' said Chase Untermeyer, a
longtime family friend and former presidential personnel director.
(Asked to compare George W. and his father in this regard,
Untermeyer said with a laugh: ``It is such a competitive family,
it's hard to make those shadings there. That's a driven
situation.'')
 &HT;    But if George W. Bush was driven, he was also known for a sharp
tongue and temper _ the ``Roman candle of the family ... and
likeliest to burn the fingers,'' as he is aptly described in
Richard Ben Cramer's ``What It Takes,'' the exhaustive account of
the 1988 presidential campaign.
 &HT;    When the Queen of England came to a White House dinner, Barbara
Bush sat George W. at the other end of the table, just to make sure
he didn't say anything undiplomatic to Her Majesty. He was the pit
bull brought in to deliver the bad news to the president's pit bull
of a chief of staff, John Sununu, when it was time for Sununu to
leave the White House.
 &HT;    And Bush, an unpaid adviser to his father, quarreled with
reporters during the 1992 campaign, frequently accusing them of
having a bias against the president.
 &HT;    Even Bush doesn't bother to deny that he was brusque in those
days.
 &HT;    ``I love my Dad, and it should not surprise you that I was a
fierce warrior on his behalf,'' he said, as his campaign plane
rumbled over the central Texas prairie one day this spring. ``And
if that ruffled people's feathers, so be it. There's a big
difference between being the son of a candidate and being the
candidate. And I understand the difference.''
 &HT;    And certainly, there was a difference by the time George W.
began his campaign for governor in 1994, a bid he contemplated four
years earlier but passed up, in part over concerns that running
with his father in the White House might look too opportunistic _
and be too embarrassing to all the Bushes if he lost.
 &HT;    Running against Ann W. Richards, the feisty and sharp-witted
incumbent who once famously derided his father as ``poor old
George,'' born with a ``silver foot in his mouth,'' Bush would seem
to have had ample reason to lose his cool.
 &HT;    In the course of the campaign, Richards called him ``Shrub,''
``that young Bush boy'' and ''some jerk,'' and joked that he was
``missing his Herbert'' (a reference to his father's two middle
names).
 &HT;    Richards frequently said that if Bush's name were George Walker,
without the Bush, no one would even take his campaign seriously _ a
point not without merit.
 &HT;    All the barbs and his prior reputation notwithstanding, Bush
turned in a truly remarkable performance. He did not lose his cool
at all, and at times he laughed right along with Richards,
basically telling voters that she sure was a funny lady, whom
everybody enjoyed, but that he came from a party and held to a
conservative philosophy that were more in line with what Texans
wanted in government. (Not that Bush wasn't out for revenge: As he
explained at the time, his strategy was to ``kill her with
kindness.'')
 &HT;    And for a man who had seemingly wandered through much of his 20s
and 30s, and who conceded that the main question surrounding him
was, ``What's the boy ever done?'' he ran a thoroughly disciplined
campaign.
 &HT;    Mindful that his father had lacked a coherent message in 1992,
Bush offered voters a precise, four-point plan for better
government: more control for local school districts, stricter
provisions for welfare recipients, tougher juvenile-justice laws
and reform of the state's tort laws. He never deviated from the
message. And while hardly the most scintillating set of political
themes ever developed, it allowed him to sidestep other issues,
particularly abortion.
 &HT;    Bush says the only painful episode from the campaign was a brief
flap over an interview he gave an Austin reporter about religion,
in which he reiterated his own personal belief that the path to
Heaven leads through acceptance of Christ as one's personal savior.
 &HT;    ``It was, of course, picked up and politicized _ you know, 'Bush
to Jews: Go to Hell,''' he recalls. ``It was very ugly. It hurt my
feelings.''
 &HT;    On election night, buoyed by the Republican surge that led to
the takeover of Congress, Bush won going away, 54 percent to 46
percent.
 &HT;    Jeb Bush, meanwhile, ran a campaign with a much sharper
conservative edge, speaking out against abortion and selecting a
Christian Coalition ``legislator of the year'' as his running mate.
To someone who briefly watched him campaign in 1994, the difference
this year is striking. He seems to have taken a page from his
brother, offering a much more upbeat message, reaching out to
minority groups, emphasizing education and greater ``compassion''
in state services.
 &HT;    Taking a break from a sweltering day of campaigning this summer
in West Palm Beach, Jeb Bush let out a tight laugh as he gave
credit to his big brother for proving himself ``the better
politician.''
 &HT;    ``He ran on four or five items or whatever it was, and he stayed
focused on that,'' Bush said. ``And that is a great lesson in
politics.''
 &HT;    Jeb Bush said he speaks to his brother about running for the
White House only ``in the contingent, in the conditional,'' but
adds that he has no doubt that his brother has ``the right stuff''
to be president.
 &HT;    And what if anyone tries to run to George W.'s right, by
emphasizing abortion or other specific social issues?
 &HT;    ``I think they'll fail,'' Jeb Bush said, ``because the broader
moral questions are the ones that concern the great majority of
people out there that fit this criteria of 'cultural
conservatives.' It is so sterile to talk about the things that the
press in this state wants to try to create, or my opponent.
Basically the same thing. There's all this Christian right, and
abortion. These are not the issues that drive people's concerns.
They want to know, how do they get the support to make sure their
children don't take drugs. They want their schools to be safe.
 &HT;    ``I'm very confident,'' he added, ``that George Bush will be
very successful if he stays the course with his message.''

<P>
   While deploring the loss of his own privacy this summer,
President Clinton set out boldly to invade mine. His administration
promised me a healthier life if I would accept assignment of a
computer code _ a number or thumb print or retina marker or other
electronic gizmo to be called a UHI, a unique health identifier.
</P>
<P>
   It would instantly disclose my medical record to anyone needing
to treat me anywhere, and also to those who labor to improve
medical science with research.
</P>
<P>
   Before I could even calculate the probable costs and benefits of
UHIs, shouts of protest forced the president to retreat. Americans,
it seems, fear snoops even more than they fear germs. Many, in
fact, responded as if their privacy were an absolute right,
guaranteed by the Constitution and not available for negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   The Bill of Rights does indeed forbid ``unreasonable searches
and seizures'' of my person, home, papers and effects. But
society's increasing invasions of my privacy have taught me that
``reasonable'' is actually a term of taste, describing a shifting
community standard, such as permissible beach attire.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike freedom, which is inviolate, privacy has long been
treated by Americans as a possession that they can trade in the
marketplace. For example, we tolerate the intrusion of telephone
sales calls at dinnertime in exchange for the convenience of phone
service around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   So I thought a UHI was worth considering. As explained by Sheryl
Gay Stolberg in The New York Times, Congress ordered the creation
of a health identifier in 1996, as part of the law that allows
Americans to keep their medical insurance whenever they switch
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration was supposed to devise a UHI plan by
February but did nothing until mid-July, when it scheduled public
hearings instead. Just one week later _ and freshly sensitized by
his president to issues of privacy _ Vice President Gore signaled a
retreat and tossed the matter back to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The proponents of UHIs foresaw vast benefits. With my
identifier, I would always be given reliable diagnoses and be
consistently treated no matter how often I changed doctors or
hospitals; my medical ailments and idiosyncrasies would be
instantly accessible. My medical bills would be streamlined, saving
me money. And adding my records to a national database would
facilitate scientific studies to improve the health of the whole
society.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents argued that the government would never properly
guard my records. Once they leaked, I would run the risk of higher
insurance premiums and possibly job discrimination. Even if

insurance, pharmaceuticals and assorted snake oils. I might grow so
fearful or angry that I would lie to my doctors just to keep my
file pristine.

   Bernadine Healy, the former director of the National Institutes
of Health, warned during the debate that government could not be
trusted with such ``sacred secrets'' as sexual practices,
impotence, abortion, depression, suicide attempts, abuse of alcohol
and drugs and a range of ``potentially prejudicial'' illnesses,
procedures and medications.
</P>
<P>
   And the vaunted national research, she said, would violate a
fundamental ethical principle: It would lack the informed consent
of its human subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Those fears were grave enough to tempt me to join the
opposition. But then I reflected on the privacies we have already
traded or given away. I do not think of myself as a ``human
subject'' just because the census regularly records my existence,
types me by income and national origin and counts my children,
toilets and TV sets.
</P>
<P>
   It's an intrusion that mainly benefits commercial enterprises,
but I have always accepted it in exchange for my fair
representation in Congress, for the insight that social statistics
give into American life and for my share of federal subsidies. And
that is only one of the many ways in which I exchange privacy for
some larger benefit.
</P>
<P>
   I have long possessed a unique number to qualify eventually for
Social Security payments. That number now doubles as my Medicare
ID, and Medicare, of course, vigorously logs all my late-life
illnesses and infirmities. The same number links all my income-tax
returns and bank accounts, including one that compiles an
electronic record as it pays my bills.
</P>
<P>
   Several more numbers unique to me record my charge-card
transactions, including meals eaten in and out, movies rented or
attended and cash withdrawn, even in foreign lands.
</P>
<P>
   I value privacy. I once renounced the purchase of a desirable
apartment because I would not let the co-op board members keep
copies of my tax returns. But I have since claimed the right to
inspect the tax returns of political candidates and think it only
fair that my alma mater inspects the tax returns of families
applying for student financial aid. Thus does privacy often yield
to decency, or expediency.
</P>
<P>
   For the safety of children, I no longer object to disclosure of
a nanny's criminal record. To obtain sizable discounts, I no longer
resent registering my medications in the computers of pharmacists
and drug manufacturers. For obviously good reasons, I announce all
my trips away from home with my newspaper deliverer, elevator
operator and building superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   For the convenience of a Visa card, I tolerate the disclosure of
my buying habits to countless merchants who sell and resell my
profile and clog my mailbox with catalogues.
</P>
<P>
   When I can, I resist new computer-age incursions until the
benefit outweighs the cost. But that makes my privacy less a fixed
right than a fluid commodity, more a matter of taste, commerce and
custom than of principle. Americans are obviously not ready to
trade their health records for vague promises of better care, but
as the medical advantages accrue, and insurers make it worth our
while, we will, and should, cut a deal.

<P>
   While deploring the loss of his own privacy this summer,
President Clinton set out boldly to invade mine. His administration
promised me a healthier life if I would accept assignment of a
computer code _ a number or thumb print or retina marker or other
electronic gizmo to be called a UHI, a unique health identifier.
</P>
<P>
   It would instantly disclose my medical record to anyone needing
to treat me anywhere, and also to those who labor to improve
medical science with research.
</P>
<P>
   Before I could even calculate the probable costs and benefits of
UHIs, shouts of protest forced the president to retreat. Americans,
it seems, fear snoops even more than they fear germs. Many, in
fact, responded as if their privacy were an absolute right,
guaranteed by the Constitution and not available for negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   The Bill of Rights does indeed forbid ``unreasonable searches
and seizures'' of my person, home, papers and effects. But
society's increasing invasions of my privacy have taught me that
``reasonable'' is actually a term of taste, describing a shifting
community standard, such as permissible beach attire.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike freedom, which is inviolate, privacy has long been
treated by Americans as a possession that they can trade in the
marketplace. For example, we tolerate the intrusion of telephone
sales calls at dinnertime in exchange for the convenience of phone
service around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   So I thought a UHI was worth considering. As explained by Sheryl
Gay Stolberg in The New York Times, Congress ordered the creation
of a health identifier in 1996, as part of the law that allows
Americans to keep their medical insurance whenever they switch
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration was supposed to devise a UHI plan by
February but did nothing until mid-July, when it scheduled public
hearings instead. Just one week later _ and freshly sensitized by
his president to issues of privacy _ Vice President Gore signaled a
retreat and tossed the matter back to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The proponents of UHIs foresaw vast benefits. With my
identifier, I would always be given reliable diagnoses and be
consistently treated no matter how often I changed doctors or
hospitals; my medical ailments and idiosyncrasies would be
instantly accessible. My medical bills would be streamlined, saving
me money. And adding my records to a national database would
facilitate scientific studies to improve the health of the whole
society.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents argued that the government would never properly
guard my records. Once they leaked, I would run the risk of higher
insurance premiums and possibly job discrimination. Even if
relatively healthy, I would be endlessly badgered by peddlers of
insurance, pharmaceuticals and assorted snake oils. I might grow so
fearful or angry that I would lie to my doctors just to keep my
file pristine.
</P>
<P>
   Bernadine Healy, the former director of the National Institutes
of Health, warned during the debate that government could not be
trusted with such ``sacred secrets'' as sexual practices,
impotence, abortion, depression, suicide attempts, abuse of alcohol
and drugs and a range of ``potentially prejudicial'' illnesses,

 By JAMES TRAUB  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It's 3 p.m., Monday, Aug. 17. President Clinton is in the White
House Map Room, testifying, and Chris Matthews, the flaxen-haired,
pink-faced, know-it-all and occasionally unhinged host of
``Hardball With Chris Matthews,'' is sitting in his office in the
Washington quarters of CNBC, scarfing a basket of Wendy's fried
chicken.
 &HT;    For Matthews, this is the Day of Days _ to be equaled later, of
course, by Sept. 11, the day of the Starr report's release _ and in
his excitement he's spraying bits of biscuit on his tie.
 &HT;    ``Hardball'' is one of a half-dozen shows, mostly on cable, that
for the past seven months have been Monicamonicamonica. There's
``Rivera Live,'' also on CNBC; ``The Big Show'' and ``The News With
Brian Williams'' on MSNBC, and ``Hannity &AMP; Colmes'' and ``The Crier
Report'' on Fox News.
 &HT;    It's a Darwinian world out there, and in this jungle of passion
and diatribe, Chris Matthews is not about to end up as anybody's
lunch.
 &HT;    He calls Bill Clinton a liar about a hundred times a night, and
he mows down the defenders of the president foolish or desperate or
brave enough to appear on the show. There's an almost Rabelaisian
zest about Matthews: He lays about him with such indiscriminate
excitement that he flattens friend and foe alike. ``Hardball'' is
the most fervent of a fervent lot; it's also probably the most
entertaining.
 &HT;    Matthews, 52, is a political junkie of classic lineage. A
streetwise Catholic kid who grew up in Philadelphia, he was trained
by the Jesuit fathers at Holy Cross, served in the Peace Corps
(rather than Vietnam) and worked as a speech writer for Jimmy
Carter and as an aide and quotemeister for House Speaker Tip
O'Neill.
 &HT;    He now writes a newspaper column for The San Francisco Examiner
and has written a book about Capitol Hill (also called
``Hardball'') and a perfectly creditable book about the
relationship between Nixon and the Kennedys. He is a pol, a
moralist and a philosopher.
 &HT;    He has more theories than a Yale English professor; he has a
theory about why he talks fast, a theory about why he yells and, of
course, a theory about our obsessional interest in the president's
sex life. Matthews tends to keep talking until he's interrupted
(and beyond), so his theory is rather involved. It goes, in part,
as follows:
 &HT;    ``The great defining circus of our time was the Cold War, which
was the great gladiatorial spectacle, Us against Them, Us at home
against Us. Every great gladiatorial contest was part of this
wonderful, unbelievably stark, Manichaean struggle. And that went
away. The bad guys are gone. Now you have bread; you have bread
like you've never had it. Bill Clinton thought it was just about
bread, he was convinced it was bread _ give these people their
market, give them their Dow, give them their unemployment rate down
to 4, 3-1/2. Bread! But there's something missing, something we
need to have in our life, something gladiatorial, something
Kulturkampf, the big question, who we are, who's in, who's out,
who's right, who's wrong. Hey, O.J. came along. And Lady Di came
along for working women. That stunned me. That story was a Roman
candle: It only lasted a week and a half or two, but it was really
hot. Why do we have these things? We want to be tested. Think about
the Roman Empire, about the circuses of Nero. Think about a circus
as establishing a society's tests _ who's in, who's out, who's part
of us, who's not part of us, what kind of country do we want to
live in? I haven't figured this out yet, obviously. It's a great
metaphor.''
 &HT;    Or, possibly, it's an appalling metaphor that makes for great
TV. I asked Matthews if maybe the reason most Americans say they
want to hear less, not more, about Monica is that they don't want
their politics to be a circus.
 &HT;    ``Yeah,'' he conceded, with the air of a man accepting a premise
to rebut an inference. ``That's the way some people look at it.''
 &HT;    Several journalists who have appeared on the show told me that
they believe Matthews' assault on the president is dictated
strictly by ratings, not belief.
 &HT;    Matthews angrily denies this. Though he remains at least a
semi-chastened liberal, he also describes himself as something of a
William Bennett conservative who considers nonchalance toward the
president's sexual behavior to be a sign of loose cultural
moorings.
 &HT;    And yet, one of the great oddities of the Lewinsky affair is
that elites in the media and politics _ the very class that people
like Matthews accuse of waging a war against traditional American
values _ have been far more exercised about it than the citizens
whose views they claim to represent.
 &HT;    So if ordinary Americans are not clamoring for more Monica, who
is the ``we'' who need a Kulturkampf? Perhaps it's the media _ that
is, perhaps ``Hardball'' creates Monica, rather than the other way
around. The Cold War didn't need ``Meet the Press'' to grab the
nation's attention; but O.J. needed Geraldo, and Geraldo,
obviously, needed O.J.
 &HT;    The nexus between mega-event and talk show has grown ever
tighter since the hostage crisis created ``Nightline.'' Now it
seems naive to speak of such events as existing independently of
their coverage. The shows live from event to event, circus to
circus.
 &HT;    When Matthews' program was first shown in 1994, on the
short-lived America's Talking channel, it was called ``In-Depth,''
a name that already sounds quaint. In this feverish new world,
Monica was a godsend. No matter what Matthews says about ratings,
it was the scandal that persuaded CNBC to expand ``Hardball'' from
half an hour to an hour in March.
 &HT;    And after Monica? We'll have to have something else _ a new
cliffhanger, a new personal drama inflated to apocalyptic
proportions.
 &HT;    Talk about ``wonderful'' _ on the day of Days, CNBC decided to
air ``Hardball'' live rather than taped, in two segments, before
and after the president's 10 p.m. speech. Waiting to go on before
the speech, Matthews sat in his office, furiously scribbling
questions on blue cards.
 &HT;    A TV set in the corner showed a fixed image of the White House
entrance through which prosecutors were expected to exit _ tedium
laced with tension.
 &HT;    Matthews felt history floating in the atmosphere; he wanted to
be equal to the moment.
 &HT;    ``My goal for tonight,'' he told his staff, ``is three different
levels. We treat the moral, the legal and the political, and we ask
ourselves the right questions, as Roger Mudd did back in '74,''
during Mudd's post-mortem analysis of Richard Nixon's resignation
speech.
 &HT;    At 20 minutes till 8, Matthews took the elevator down to the
studio and seated himself at a crescent-shaped table. His guests
for the first hour included Stuart Taylor, the respected legal
journalist and a harsh critic of the president; Ron Nessen, the
former White House spokesman (for Gerald Ford); Marcia Clark, the
former O.J. prosecutor; and Elizabeth Holtzman and Dennis
DeConcini, former members of Congress.
 &HT;    The Monica shows have been a tremendous boon to former
everythings. The cable programs have so much air time to fill _
Matthews alone runs through 50 guests a week _ that they often have
to rely on people with only the kind of hypothetical expertise
conferred by resumes.
 &HT;    Matthews opened solemnly. The ultimate question, he said, was,
``Can the chief law-enforcement agent of the nation play with the
truth and still lead the nation?'' Then, with the magic words,
``Let's play hardball!'' the circus began.
 &HT;    Taylor said reports indicated that the president would admit in
his speech to ``some sort of sexual relationship'' with Lewinsky,
and that he had not been ``completely candid about it.''
 &HT;    Matthews jumped on him. ``Why do you use terms like 'some sort
of' and 'completely?'''
 &HT;    Taylor was on Matthews' side, but he had made the mistake of
stating the case in neutral terms. On ``Hardball'' there is no
middle. If you have trouble with that, you don't get invited back.
 &HT;    ``He lied,'' Taylor said, dropping the legalistic phrase. ``We
all know he lied.''
 &HT;    The gladiatorial combat that gives ``Hardball'' its faintly
sadistic appeal is not, interestingly, between the guests but
between the host and his guests. Matthews is a gleeful warrior, by
turns mocking, witty, high-minded and bullying. Even if he doesn't
know more than his guests, he can generally out-argue them; and
when he can't do that, he can just talk them into the ground.
 &HT;    Now he turned to Marcia Clark, in Los Angeles, and said, ``He's
now saying that the kind of sex he had with Monica Lewinsky did not
constitute sexual relations, and it seems to me by that definition,
Hugh Grant should be exonerated for what happened to him on the
Sunset Strip several months back, and every hooker that's picked up
on Broadway tonight for selling sex should be exonerated.''
 &HT;    Clark had battled wits with Johnnie Cochran, but Matthews
reduced her to an equivocal stammer.
 &HT;    By now, Matthews didn't need his guests at all. He turned to the
camera and shouted: ``I'd like to suggest that in every household
and every car pool and every barroom in America, and every party
you've been to in the past seven months, there's been somebody
who's spoken up for the president and said, 'I believe he didn't
have this relationship.' All of those people are part of the
recruited, commissioned and put-in-the-field army of Clinton liars.
He has made them all into liars ... and tonight he better come on
and apologize to those people.''
 &HT;    It was a majestic outburst, at least if you hate Clinton. If you
didn't, it was just plain menacing.
 &HT;    Then he cut to Elizabeth Holtzman in New York, a staunch
presidential defender, and reduced her to waving her hands and
saying, ``Chris ... Chris ... Chris'' as he buried her beneath a
torrent of words.
 &HT;    Afterwards, back in his office, Matthews looked out the window
and said: ``I got too emotional. What happened out there?''
 &HT;    What happened to restraint _ the whole rising-to-the-moment
thing? Matthews genuinely would like to give off light as well as
heat, but some combination of intellectual vanity, lack of table
manners and sheer passion does him in every time.
 &HT;    Of course, that's why he's on the air. If you want depth, you
can read a book.

the Roman Empire, about the circuses of Nero. Think about a circus
as establishing a society's tests _ who's in, who's out, who's part
of us, who's not part of us, what kind of country do we want to
live in? I haven't figured this out yet, obviously. It's a great
metaphor.''
 &HT;    Or, possibly, it's an appalling metaphor that makes for great
TV. I asked Matthews if maybe the reason most Americans say they
want to hear less, not more, about Monica is that they don't want
their politics to be a circus.
 &HT;    ``Yeah,'' he conceded, with the air of a man accepting a premise
to rebut an inference. ``That's the way some people look at it.''
 &HT;    Several journalists who have appeared on the show told me that
they believe Matthews' assault on the president is dictated
strictly by ratings, not belief.
 &HT;    Matthews angrily denies this. Though he remains at least a
semi-chastened liberal, he also describes himself as something of a
William Bennett conservative who considers nonchalance toward the
president's sexual behavior to be a sign of loose cultural
moorings.
 &HT;    And yet, one of the great oddities of the Lewinsky affair is
that elites in the media and politics _ the very class that people
like Matthews accuse of waging a war against traditional American
values _ have been far more exercised about it than the citizens
whose views they claim to represent.
 &HT;    So if ordinary Americans are not clamoring for more Monica, who
is the ``we'' who need a Kulturkampf? Perhaps it's the media _ that
is, perhaps ``Hardball'' creates Monica, rather than the other way
around. The Cold War didn't need ``Meet the Press'' to grab the
nation's attention; but O.J. needed Geraldo, and Geraldo,
obviously, needed O.J.
 &HT;    The nexus between mega-event and talk show has grown ever
tighter since the hostage crisis created ``Nightline.'' Now it
seems naive to speak of such events as existing independently of
their coverage. The shows live from event to event, circus to
circus.
 &HT;    When Matthews' program was first shown in 1994, on the
short-lived America's Talking channel, it was called ``In-Depth,''
a name that already sounds quaint. In this feverish new world,
Monica was a godsend. No matter what Matthews says about ratings,
it was the scandal that persuaded CNBC to expand ``Hardball'' from
half an hour to an hour in March.
 &HT;    And after Monica? We'll have to have something else _ a new
cliffhanger, a new personal drama inflated to apocalyptic
proportions.
 &HT;    Talk about ``wonderful'' _ on the day of Days, CNBC decided to
air ``Hardball'' live rather than taped, in two segments, before
and after the president's 10 p.m. speech. Waiting to go on before
the speech, Matthews sat in his office, furiously scribbling
questions on blue cards.
 &HT;    A TV set in the corner showed a fixed image of the White House
entrance through which prosecutors were expected to exit _ tedium
laced with tension.
 &HT;    Matthews felt history floating in the atmosphere; he wanted to
be equal to the moment.
 &HT;    ``My goal for tonight,'' he told his staff, ``is three different
levels. We treat the moral, the legal and the political, and we ask
ourselves the right questions, as Roger Mudd did back in '74,''
during Mudd's post-mortem analysis of Richard Nixon's resignation
speech.
 &HT;    At 20 minutes till 8, Matthews took the elevator down to the
studio and seated himself at a crescent-shaped table. His guests
for the first hour included Stuart Taylor, the respected legal
journalist and a harsh critic of the president; Ron Nessen, the
former White House spokesman (for Gerald Ford); Marcia Clark, the
former O.J. prosecutor; and Elizabeth Holtzman and Dennis
DeConcini, former members of Congress.
 &HT;    The Monica shows have been a tremendous boon to former
everythings. The cable programs have so much air time to fill _
Matthews alone runs through 50 guests a week _ that they often have
to rely on people with only the kind of hypothetical expertise
conferred by resumes.
 &HT;    Matthews opened solemnly. The ultimate question, he said, was,
``Can the chief law-enforcement agent of the nation play with the
truth and still lead the nation?'' Then, with the magic words,
``Let's play hardball!'' the circus began.
 &HT;    Taylor said reports indicated that the president would admit in
his speech to ``some sort of sexual relationship'' with Lewinsky,
and that he had not been ``completely candid about it.''
 &HT;    Matthews jumped on him. ``Why do you use terms like 'some sort
of' and 'completely?'''
 &HT;    Taylor was on Matthews' side, but he had made the mistake of
stating the case in neutral terms. On ``Hardball'' there is no
middle. If you have trouble with that, you don't get invited back.
 &HT;    ``He lied,'' Taylor said, dropping the legalistic phrase. ``We
all know he lied.''
 &HT;    The gladiatorial combat that gives ``Hardball'' its faintly
sadistic appeal is not, interestingly, between the guests but
between the host and his guests. Matthews is a gleeful warrior, by
turns mocking, witty, high-minded and bullying. Even if he doesn't
know more than his guests, he can generally out-argue them; and
when he can't do that, he can just talk them into the ground.
 &HT;    Now he turned to Marcia Clark, in Los Angeles, and said, ``He's
now saying that the kind of sex he had with Monica Lewinsky did not
constitute sexual relations, and it seems to me by that definition,
Hugh Grant should be exonerated for what happened to him on the
Sunset Strip several months back, and every hooker that's picked up
on Broadway tonight for selling sex should be exonerated.''
 &HT;    Clark had battled wits with Johnnie Cochran, but Matthews
reduced her to an equivocal stammer.
 &HT;    By now, Matthews didn't need his guests at all. He turned to the
camera and shouted: ``I'd like to suggest that in every household
and every car pool and every barroom in America, and every party
you've been to in the past seven months, there's been somebody
who's spoken up for the president and said, 'I believe he didn't
have this relationship.' All of those people are part of the
recruited, commissioned and put-in-the-field army of Clinton liars.
He has made them all into liars ... and tonight he better come on
and apologize to those people.''
 &HT;    It was a majestic outburst, at least if you hate Clinton. If you
didn't, it was just plain menacing.
 &HT;    Then he cut to Elizabeth Holtzman in New York, a staunch
presidential defender, and reduced her to waving her hands and
saying, ``Chris ... Chris ... Chris'' as he buried her beneath a
torrent of words.
 &HT;    Afterwards, back in his office, Matthews looked out the window
and said: ``I got too emotional. What happened out there?''
 &HT;    What happened to restraint _ the whole rising-to-the-moment
thing? Matthews genuinely would like to give off light as well as
heat, but some combination of intellectual vanity, lack of table
manners and sheer passion does him in every time.
 &HT;    Of course, that's why he's on the air. If you want depth, you
can read a book.

   CALIF-PRISONS (San Francisco) _ Spending on the state's

decade at the expense of public higher education, according to a
report released Wednesday by a think tank on criminal justice
issues. By VENISE WAGNER.

   SPORTS-QUIZ (Albany, N.Y.) _ First off, the following is an
exercise in futility. Trying to come up with the greatest athlete

speaking, impossible. So we tried anyway. By MARK McGUIRE.

   FOOD (``d'' category)

   GARLIC (Albany, N.Y.) _ Rule No. 1 regarding garlic: There's no
such thing as too much garlic. Rule No. 2: There's no right or
wrong way to cook with garlic, either, provided you don't burn one
of the world's oldest cultivated plants. Back to Rule No. 1. By
DOUG BLACKBURN.

<P>
   LEBANESE-ENTERTAINING (San Pedro, Calif.) _ First, you must

<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-PLEA-BARGAIN (Washington) _ Sure President Clinton and
Monica Lewinsky are guilty of being emotionally fragile and
careless. And there's no question that Clinton committed a stupid

recesses of the Oval Office. But impeach the guy for a dalliance?
Maybe Hillary Rodham Clinton should, but not Congress. By TIMOTHY
SPENCE.

   LYNCH-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ Most freaks you can spot right
away. They have six heads, three eyes or some other physical
characteristic that sets them apart from the rest of humanity. Not
all of them, though. For example, Rachel McEneny looks completely
normal. But Rachel McEneny is clearly a freak of nature. There's no
other way to explain how her body sheds alcohol at such a stunning
rate. By DAN LYNCH.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Improved Find feature important part of OS 8.5 
By Charles Haddad  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apple Computer plans to release its next update to the Mac
operating system in less than a month, and it looks like a keeper.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed OS 8.5, this upgrade not only speeds up basic performance
but adds several important features. Those include a greatly
enhanced Find feature and the ability to customize the look of the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of this OS upgrade is lots of new code written
specifically for the PowerPC chip that runs all new Macs. That code
enables Power Macs to run an average of 30 percent faster. Actions
that will run faster include copying files, searching and emptying
the trash can.
</P>
<P>
   The downside is you can't use this upgrade if your computer is
not a Power Mac. That includes such models as the SE, Centris, LC,
IIsi and Classic.
</P>
<P>
   In OS 8.5, Apple Computer has totally rewritten its Find
feature. It will now be able to search for content within files.
And what's found will be sorted by relevance, with the closest
match listed first.
</P>
<P>
   The new Find feature will also let you search the Internet
without a browser. Of course, you'll still need a modem and an
Internet provider to access the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Another great new feature is the ability of the OS now to check
and repair itself. It won't catch and fix every problem but is
designed to identify the most common ones. This feature used to be
a separate program called Disk First Aid. Now it has been built
into the OS.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the changes in OS 8.5 are cosmetic tweaks that make the
Mac more fun and easier to use. For example, Apple Computer will
now allow you to customize the look of your screen. You can choose
among themes that change the look of scroll bars, arrows and title
boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer will supply two new theme looks, called Hi-Tech
and Gizmo, with the OS 8.5.
</P>
<P>
   Another small but helpful change will be the ability for a
floating window that lets you switch applications with a click of
the mouse. This feature, offered for years by shareware, now will
become part of the OS.
</P>
<P>
   These are just a few of the many changes coming in OS 8.5. No
price has yet been released for this upgrade, expected to be
released Oct. 9.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, check out Mac Web sites such as MacNN. It
features a special page devoted to OS 8.5, called Allegro. You'll
find the site at http://www.macnn.com/reality/allegro.shtml

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Voice recognition software takes work 
By Jack Warner  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was my hope, going into this series on voice recognition
programs, that at some point I would be able to announce that this
column was written without the need for a keyboard. Regrettably,
that will not be the case _ although, if I had all the time in the
world and a lot of inclination, it might be done.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, it is possible for any of you with an Internet
connection to try out this technology at little or no expense,
depending on whether you have a suitable microphone.
</P>
<P>
   FreeSpeech from Philips is a shareware program you can download
for free and try for 30 days. After that, it will cost you $40 to
get a key to keep it going.
</P>
<P>
   FreeSpeech is certainly the cheapest of the voice recognition
programs I've tried, but I find it to be at least the equal of
IBM's ViaVoice Gold, to which it is very similar. Both programs
used several different modes _ command for editing and controlling
programs, dictation for doing just that, plus spelling and other
modes. They are intended to work with virtually any Windows 95 or
NT program.
</P>
<P>
   I spent the usual amount of time ``enrolling'' in FreeSpeech _
that is, reading text it presented to familiarize it with my voice
and speech patterns. This was more enjoyable than either of the
preceding programs because Philips gives you a wide choice of
things to read. I chose the best part of the best horror story ever
written _ Jonathan Harker's diary of his trip through Transylvania
and his stay at that most unpleasant place, Castle Dracula.
</P>
<P>
   I then tested FreeSpeech by dictating my favorite sentence:
``Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their
country.'' FreeSpeech could not distinguish between ``come'' and
``comma.'' It kept inserting a comma when I said ``come.''
</P>
<P>
   You can feed the program text documents you have already written
in order to further familiarize it with your style, or at least
with the language. I gave it a handful of documents to look at and
pushed the Recognition slider from the halfway mark between
``speed'' and ``accuracy'' somewhat into the area of greater
accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Bingo! Now I get punctuation when I say ``comma'' and I get
``come'' when I say ``come.'' However, only three words further
down the line another problem arose. FreeSpeech was unable to
comprehend ``aid.'' It gave me ``ate'' and ``eight,'' but no aid.
At that point someone knocked on the door, sending our dog into his
savage beast act. FreeSpeech nearly came unglued _ ``Please
repeat!'' ``Please repeat!'' it demanded. Finally, it translated
the dog's last statement as ``all.'' The thing couldn't even get
``arf.''
</P>
<P>
   I have no doubt that with further effort, I could teach it the
word ``aid.'' Unfortunately, I have no patience with teaching a
machine. I'd rather type anyway.
</P>
<P>
   For the FreeSpeech test, I used Philips' SpeechMike, a sharp
departure from the flimsy headsets supplied with the previous two
programs. It's a sturdy hand-held gizmo that contains a speaker, a
microphone, a little trackball for running the mouse, left and
right buttons, and another right-clicking button on the underside,
right where your forefinger normally falls. I liked it a great
deal. Of course, it costs around $70, probably more than five times
what the headsets cost.
</P>
<P>
   If your primary goal is to work with Microsoft Word, then L&AMP;H's
Voice Xpress Plus, at $69, is the way to go. If you want to work
less extensively with a lot of different programs, give FreeSpeech
a try. IBM has upgraded its ViaVoice in configurations from $50 to
$150, and I will re-review that program soon. Just remember, if you
choose any of these, you're in for a lot of work to make it
worthwhile.

Smaller packages pack more PC power 
By John Ghirardini  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thin is in these days, and computer manufacturers looking to
fatten their wallets haven't let that fact go unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   IBM and Toshiba have unveiled new desktop machines, aimed at the
high-end consumer and the mid-range commercial markets, that look
almost anorexic when compared with the squat computer cases and
bulky monitors that weigh down many work spaces.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers who must have the fastest and latest, IBM has
topped its Aptiva line with the SE7, which features a 450 MHz Intel
Pentium II MMX chip, 128 megabytes of RAM expandable to 384 megs, a
16.8 gigabyte hard drive, a DVD-ROM drive, a 56K modem and a pair
of Infinity speakers.
</P>
<P>
   To save space, IBM offers a 15-inch flat-panel LCD monitor that
offers the viewable area of a 17-inch standard monitor. The SE7 is
available with either a 17- or 19-inch standard CRT, but the basic
configuration has a purposeful, futuristic look about it that
technophiles will find hard to resist.
</P>
<P>
   Retail price is $2,399 without monitor; the choice of monitor
will raise the price to around $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   For commercial users, there's the new Toshiba Equium 100, which
has a 300 MHz Pentium II chip, 64 megabytes of RAM, a 4 gigabyte
hard drive, a CD-ROM drive and a built-in networking capability.
The entire setup takes up less desk space than a single standard
17-inch monitor, Toshiba says.
</P>
<P>
   Crowning it all is a 15-inch digital LCD monitor with integrated
speakers, a built-in microphone and built-in jacks for headphones
and mike input and output.
</P>
<P>
   The screen can swivel to a 90-degree vertical or horizontal
viewing angle, allowing large documents or spreadsheets to be seen

   Kids 3 to 7 can combine learning and fun with a new product from
Microsoft, ``My Personal Tutor: Preschool-First Grade'' for Windows
95.
</P>
<P>
   The software features a new Tutor Assist learning technology,
which according to Microsoft recognizes when a child needs help
with a concept, then offers a multimedia tutorial to help the child
understand.
</P>
<P>
   The software comes in a suite of four CD-ROMs, all featuring
Professor P.T. Presto, who guides children through tutorials with
music, animation and humor. The CDs contain hundreds of songs,
games, activities and characters designed to foster confidence,
curiosity, exploration and learning, Microsoft says.
</P>
<P>
   The four titles are:
</P>
<P>
   ``Preschool Workshop'' (ages 3-5), in which kids learn shapes,
colors, counting and other skills while helping friendly jungle
animals build toys;
</P>
<P>
   ``Alphabet Playhouse'' (ages 3-5), which highlights letter
recognition, uppercase and lowercase letters and pre-reading skills
with Rosy Raccoon;
</P>
<P>
   ``Reader Railway'' (ages 4-6), which focuses on vocabulary and
reading comprehension during a trip to the circus with Rosy
Raccoon's cousin Rusty; and
</P>
<P>
   ``Mathopolis'' (ages 5-7), in which kids hone their thinking and
problem-solving while developing addition and subtraction skills in
five fast-paced games.
</P>
<P>
   The software will be available in late September for a retail
price of $55. A free trial version has been available since Sept.
10 at http://www.microsoft.com/kids/.

   The number of cool gadgets for home businesses is growing. The
September issue of Small Business Computing takes a quick look at
some of the interesting ones recently released. Among them is the
Novatel Minstrel, an 8-ounce modem for the PalmPilot. The Minstrel
slips around the PalmPilot to create a new device no bigger than a
cellular phone. It enables the PalmPilot to receive e-mail and surf
the Web. A big difference between the Minstrel and a cellular phone
is the price. The Minstrel costs $400. Another product discussed is
a slender little black box called Symphony. It enables users to
wirelessly share files, printers and faxes, as well as connect to
the Internet. Made by Proxim, it retails for $299.
</P>
<P>
   No longer are affluent white males the typical Net users. Users
now are as varied as the country's population. At least that's the
conclusion of a special report in the September issue of Yahoo!
Internet Life. The magazine found that nearly 52 million people are
online. The article features interviews with a varied group of
surfers including students, comedians, park rangers and truck
drivers.

   War game simulations are becoming increasingly realistic. A new
example is ``Spearhead,'' a desert tank game just released by
Interactive Magic. You play a platoon leader in the 3rd Armored
Division. Your platoon is part of Operation Removal, a U.S.
campaign to repel Libyan invaders from Tunisia in North Africa. The
game includes 20 single-player missions and one big campaign. The
tanks and other armored vehicles look like their counterparts in
real life. You can also play the game over the Internet or a
network. The game is available only for PCs with Windows 95 or
higher operating systems and retails for $39.95.
</P>
<P>
   Broderbund Software is releasing a trio of new learning games
using Dr. Seuss characters. Designed for young children, the games
are ``Dr. Seuss Preschool,'' ``Dr. Seuss Kindergarten'' and ``Dr.
Seuss Kindergarten Deluxe.'' Each title includes 250 lessons in
math and reading. The lessons are taught through more than 50 Seuss
characters, who sing original songs and act in the various
activities and games. The first two games retail for $19.99, while
the deluxe game is $29.99.

SEEING THE STARR REPORT ON THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I'm not on line, there's a good chance I'm watching C-SPAN,
the public affairs TV channel that features political speeches and
congressional hearings. I'm not terribly political _ I just like
bathing in the blue glow of pure information.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet offered much the same experience to millions of us
who downloaded Ken Starr's report on President Clinton. Liberated
from the pundits, we could read and decide for ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Predictions of a Starr-spawned Internet meltdown never made
sense. Of the 50 million people in North America who have access to
the Internet, about 13 million use the America Online computer
network, and another couple of million use CompuServe. Neither are
truly part of the Internet. AOL and CompuServe are private
networks, with server computers that distribute information
exclusively to their members. And one of those servers contained a
copy of the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the frenzy, I hopped on to AOL and got a copy
with no trouble. As of Wednesday, more than 750,000 AOL customers
had done the same. Each of those downloads is a rebuke to the
skeptics who predicted the Internet would kill AOL.
</P>
<P>
   It was harder to read the Starr report than it was to download
it, and not just because of its gamy content, or its 445-page
length. Worse yet, there was little effort to create an
easy-to-read electronic version.
</P>
<P>
   Computers make dreadful books. Monitors are hard on the eyes and
hard to carry to the bathroom. Besides, most on-line sources of the
report threw the data up on the Web either as a plain text file, or
with primitive Web page formatting.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad, because documents like the Starr report can actually be
easier to read on computer. The report is filled with
cross-references and footnotes _ the sort of thing that physicist
Tim Berners-Lee had in mind when he invented Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   Web-based versions of the report include crude but serviceable
hyper-linked footnotes. When did Betty Currie decide Monica
Lewinsky had become ``a pain in the neck''? Click note 484. Care
for a cigar? Light up note 42.
</P>
<P>
   The system works, but not very well. The footnotes are linked to
separate Web pages, so it's clumsy to hop between notes and text.
And for a handy overview of the complete document, it's back to the
contents page.
</P>
<P>
   To see the Starr report done right, visit
www.trellix.com/icreport. This site was set up by Trellix Corp. of
Waltham, Mass., makers of an unusually good Web design tool.
Trellix software has been used to turn the complex Starr report
into a comparatively easy read.
</P>
<P>
   The report itself occupies a large window inside the browser.
Above it is a ``document map'' with clickable links to each section
of the document. To the left is an outline of the document, with
abbreviated subject headings. Again, you can click these headings
to move through the report. And at the bottom is a window that
displays footnote data. Click footnote 42. The document stays put,
but the relevant citation appears in the footnote window.
</P>
<P>
   Trellix founder Dan Bricklin hopes government agencies will
someday issue their documents in Trellix format. It's not a bad
idea. Starr's original report was written in WordPerfect, the
favorite word-processing program of attorneys, but little used by
the rest of us. Trellix produces documents in HTML, readable by
everybody with a browser.
</P>
<P>
   But good text formatting is not enough. The government's Web
servers were overwhelmed by demand for the Starr report, and were
forced to fall back on mirror sites. What's needed is a permanent
arrangement for the Internet publication of government documents.
The model for such a system already exists: C-SPAN, a private
entity funded from the profits of cable TV companies.
</P>
<P>
   With billions of dollars at their disposal, the nation's
computer software and hardware companies can easily create an
equivalent service for the Web, to serve up Web versions of vital
government documents. It's the sort of idea that the Clinton
administration would have hailed _ right up until last week.

U.S. AGENCY FAULTS STUDY ON EXPORTS OF COMPUTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JEFF GERTH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the Clinton administration relaxed export
controls on high-performance computers in 1996, it relied on a
flawed report that did not study the national security implications
and concluded with scant data that the computers were already
easily available around the world, government auditors said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The opposite conclusion is true, said the General Accounting
Office, the audit arm of Congress. In a report released to a Senate
panel, the auditors found that such high-performance computers
``are not readily available'' to countries of national security
concern to the United States, like China, India or Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report also said that American manufacturers continue to
dominate the overseas market. An important administration argument
for loosening export controls was that easing controls was the only
way American computer makers could compete against widely available
foreign-made technology.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors said that ``a key element'' in the decision to
relax the export controls was a Stanford University study,
commissioned by the Commerce and Defense departments without any
competition, that said some U.S. computer technology was
uncontrollable worldwide and efforts to control it would harm the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   But the auditors said that the study ``lacked empirical evidence
or analysis regarding its conclusion'' of uncontrollability. The
GAO also said that the study failed to do one of its assigned
tasks: study how countries like China might use the computers for
military purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year after the export rules were loosened, military
installations in Russia and China obtained a few powerful new
American computers, prompting criminal investigations and a
retightening by Congress of the export controls.
</P>
<P>
   The study's authors responded to the GAO, and their responses
were presented to the Senate subcommittee on International
Security, Proliferation and Federal Services by Harold Johnson, the
GAO's associate director.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said that the authors told the accounting office that
they did not do a national security threat analysis because the
federal government does not have the right information to do such a
study. Seymour Goodman, the study's principal author, disputed the
GAO's criticism of his report's analysis. ``We had a lot of
empirical evidence and we did a comprehensive analysis that was
different from theirs and that focused on the availability of
U.S.-built systems.''
</P>
<P>
   William Reinsch, the undersecretary of commerce for export
administration, defended the administration's relaxation of
controls and said the GAO had asked the wrong question in looking
at the computer marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the U.S. today dominates the market for
high-performance computers, there is a performance threshold below
which we can not realistically expect to maintain control of
computers unless we restrict sales to our closest allies,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Reinsch went on to argue that the GAO was wrong to rank national
security as the top priority for looking at this issue. Instead, he
said, the first priority should be the realities of the
marketplace, where high-performance computers ``are becoming less
and less controllable because they are becoming smaller, cheaper,
more powerful and more reliable, requiring less vendor support.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton announced the change in policy in late 1995,
fulfilling a pledge he made early in his administration to computer
executives. The move also helped countries like China, which could
now buy more advanced American computers without any federal
license as long as the technology was used for civilian purposes.
</P>
<P>
   But the new rules made the exporter responsible for deciding
whether a license was required, a decision previously made by the
federal government. This new responsibility, the GAO report said,
was ``particularly difficult'' for companies selling to countries
like China, ``where identifying the distinction between a civilian
and military end user can be difficult without information that is
sometimes available only to the U.S. government.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Clinton administration is weighing whether to further
relax the computer export limits. But the administration's critics
remain ``concerned that the policy is flawed,'' said Sen. Thad
Cochran, R-Miss., who led Wednesday's hearing.

HOW THE INTERNET COULD CHANGE PATIENT CARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ILANA DEBARE   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet someday could revolutionize the way consumers
relate to their health plans and their doctors.
</P>
<P>
   But _ with one big exception _ you wouldn't ever guess that from
the Web pages produced by health plans today.
</P>
<P>
   All of California's largest health plans now have Web pages
aimed at their members and potential members. But most plans simply
use their Web pages as electronic brochures _ listing benefits they
offer or reprinting information that's already been published in
paper form.
</P>
<P>
   The exception is Kaiser Permanente, which is boldly
experimenting with interactive services like online-advice nurses
and appointment-making and electronic discussion groups for
patients suffering from a common ailment.
</P>
<P>
   ``My general impression is that most health plans are doing
marketing online, and Kaiser is the exception that is doing
something substantial,'' said Tom Ferguson, a University of Texas
professor who edits a newsletter about online health information.
</P>
<P>
   How COULD the Internet someday change the relationship between
health plans and their members?
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a time when your medical records are available in a
private electronic file that you can view over the Internet.
Certain words in the file will link you to other Web resources: If
your doctor types in ``asthma,'' for instance, you might see links
to a half-dozen asthma support groups across the country or to a
bibliography of the latest asthma research.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a time when you routinely exchange e-mail with your
doctor or pharmacist. Or when you can consult with specialists in
New York by e-mail _ and show them your medical chart over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a time when the claims process is entirely visible over
the Web so that you can see whether your health plan has processed
a particular bill. Or when you can file a complaint by e-mail and
get a response in just a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people think the action in health on the Web will be in
providing information, but where it really will be is in
interaction and people-to-people connections,'' Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, such innovative electronic services remain a distant
vision.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what almost all health insurers now provide on their Web
sites:
</P>
<P>
   _ Descriptions of the plans they offer but not the prices for
each plan.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lists of doctors affiliated with their plan. Most health plan
Web sites let you type in your address and get names of nearby
doctors. Some sites give you more information than others _ such as
which hospitals each doctor works with, or whether doctors are
accepting new patients.
</P>
<P>
   _ Basic preventive health information, such as articles on
low-fat cooking, or timetables for when children should get
immunizations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some but not all sites provide the health plan's
formulary _ the list of drugs covered by the plan. A few offer
links to other health-related sites, such as the American Cancer
Society's Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Some health plan Web pages feature information that looks
colorful but has little relevance to anyone's health.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross of California, for instance, has a site that might be
mistaken for a travel agency. It includes listings of where to rent
hot-air balloons in the Napa Valley or how much it costs to rent a
houseboat on Lake Shasta. (Visit the Web site at
www.bluecrossca.com.)
</P>
<P>
   ``What a state! You can surf Malibu one day and ski the Sierra
the next,'' Blue Cross says in the welcome to its site.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of plans provide in-depth health information that can
be extremely useful.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna's site includes a health encyclopedia that it developed
with Johns Hopkins University, where visitors can search for
detailed information on everything from arthritis to vertigo. (Go
to www.aetnaushc.com.)
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Kaiser offers a 20,000-page online health
encyclopedia _ much more information than can be found in the
150-page printed health handbook typically given to Kaiser members.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser's health encyclopedia is part of an experimental
interactive Web site that it's gradually rolling out to members in
Northern California, Washington, D.C., and Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   The members-only site is at www.kponline.org, which is different
from Kaiser's general corporate Web site. It is expected to be
available to all Northern California Kaiser members by the end of
this year. (Non-members can tour the site at
www.kaiserpermanente.org /membersonly/overview.htm.)
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser's members-only site offers:
</P>
<P>
   _ Online health assessments that identify your biggest health
risk and provide links to follow-up information.
</P>
<P>
   _ Online access to advice nurses and pharmacists, who will
respond by e-mail within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   _ Online appointment making.
</P>
<P>
   _ Online discussion groups on topics ranging from HIV to
parenting. Some are moderated by doctors and nurses, while others
are led by rank-and-file Kaiser members who have received special
training.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser officials say they envision a ``virtual medical center''
that will someday meet as wide a range of patient needs as today's
brick-and-mortar medical centers do.
</P>
<P>
   Such a goal may be easier to achieve for Kaiser than for other
health plans, which don't have their own doctors, pharmacies and
hospitals all under one corporate roof.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser's current lead in Web services is due partly to this
centralization: Kaiser doesn't have to cajole dozens of different
doctors' groups into linking their appointment books with its
computer.
</P>
<P>
   It's also due to some forethought. Kaiser started looking at how
interactive technology could help its members as early as 1992.
That's given the HMO time to work out issues like how to protect
patient confidentiality, while allowing online interactions.
</P>
<P>
   But other health plans are likely to follow Kaiser down this
path as quickly as they can. Health Net and Blue Cross, for
instance, say they're almost ready to let members check the status
of claims online.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how far down the road you look, the Web doesn't
replace in-person care or telephone access,'' said Tim Kieschnik,
who is overseeing Kaiser's Internet strategy. ``Medicine will
always have a hands-on component. However, a lot of pieces of
medicine can be greatly enhanced by using the Web. We just need to
use it to connect the patient with the physician, rather than to
keep patients and physicians apart.''

STUDIES DIFFER ON INTERNET'S IMPACT ON TV 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   So, are eyes starting to wander?
</P>
<P>
   With tens of millions of people using the Internet every day,
more and more advertisers and media executives are starting to
wonder whether active surfers are watching less television.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, several surveys have found that heavy Internet users say
their time online eats into their television viewing more than any
other activity, although they also say they spend less time
reading, talking to friends and sleeping. One widely reported study
by Nielsen Media Research for America Online last month found that
households that had Internet access watched 15 percent less
television than those that did not.
</P>
<P>
   But the America Online study stopped short of proving that
Internet use was the cause of the lower television use. And a lot
of other research appeared to show the opposite _ that people were
still watching more television even as they increasingly surfed the
Internet. Such research indicates that many people perform both
activities at the same time.

<P>
   A new study scheduled for release Monday, commissioned by
Discovery Networks, the operator of science-oriented cable
television channels and a unit of Discovery Communications Inc.,
takes the side of those who contend that net-surfing does not cut
down on the time devoted to channel-surfing.
</P>
<P>
   The Discovery study, which probed deeper into the same Nielsen
data that America Online used, concluded that as households began
to use the Internet, television use by teen-agers dropped but use
by everyone else increased.
</P>
<P>
   That was consistent with a study commissioned by MTV Networks, a
unit of Viacom Inc., and released in June. ``We see media
consumption leading to more media consumption,'' said Betsy Frank,
executive vice president for research at MTV Networks. ``People
don't quit watching television because they go online. They do more
of both.''
</P>
<P>
   The MTV study asked 25,000 people to keep diaries of their media
use. Those who said they were heavy Internet users also said they
watched more cable television than average and read more books than
the average respondent.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many studies are now finding an increase in what has
become known as multitasking _ surfing the Internet, watching
television, cooking dinner and talking on the telephone, all at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Frank said this phenomenon was confirmed on May 14, the
night of the last episode of ``Seinfeld.'' That evening the
television audience surged, but Internet use increased as well,
according to measurements by Relevant Knowledge, an Atlanta
research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Other seeming threats to television use _ the videocassette
recorder and video games, for example _ have been found not to
reduce the amount of network and cable television that people
watch.
</P>
<P>
   People use VCRs to record TV programs they otherwise would miss,
which offsets whatever decline in television watching may come from
people watching prerecorded movies, said Paul Lindstrom, a vice
president of Nielsen.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of video games was even more surprising: They
increase the number of televisions in a household as well as
viewership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before video games, kids would watch ``The Flintstones'' or
whatever, after school in the family room,'' Lindstrom said. ``When
a family gets a video game, they often buy a television set for the
kids' bedroom. That means the kids can watch TV whenever they want
to and the parents can watch what they want in the afternoon,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes in such findings are high for the television
networks, for the Internet services and for the advertisers who
must choose where to place their messages. Television, after all,
has proved to be the most powerful medium in history for selling
products. And the idea that the rapid growth of the Internet might
pull people away from their sets is frightening to many commercial
interests, especially since advertisements online have yet to prove
effective for sales of many consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   Internet use is certainly taking a big chunk of Americans' time.
The 13 million members of America Online, for example, log an
average of 45 minutes daily. That is why the America Online study
that showed lower television use in Internet homes received such
attention. But many media experts said it glossed over important
demographic variables.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet user base is more upscale than the rest of the
population,'' said Lynn Bolger, senior vice president for media at
APL Digital, a unit of Interpublic Group of Cos. ``And
traditionally that is a group that is not a heavy viewer of
television.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   America Online concedes that its study was limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think online time is eating into television time,'' said
Marshall Cohen, the senior vice president for brand development of
America Online. ``If you say prove it, I say the definitive study
has not been done.''
</P>
<P>
   The best study, of course, would monitor people's use of
television before they signed up for the Internet and then after
they started to go online. So far, that research has not been done,
but the Discovery study with Nielsen came close. In October 1996
and again in October 1997, it measured television use in 2,218
homes that are part of Nielsen's continuing television rating
panel.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen did not ask participants whether they had Internet
access in 1996, so the study could not differentiate longtime
Internet users from those homes that signed up for the Internet for
the first time between the two measurements.
</P>
<P>
   Still, since Internet use was increasing nationwide during that
period, Discovery estimates that 40 percent of the people who had
Internet access in 1997 first went online after the 1996
measurement. Households that told Nielsen in 1997 that they had
access to the Internet increased their television use by 1.8
percent over the previous year, compared with a 1.3 percent
increase over all for the whole sample.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a perfect measure,'' said Steve McGowan, Discovery's
research director. ``But if the Internet was taking time away from
television, you should have seen viewership decline, but in fact it
went up.''
</P>
<P>
   Discovery did find that sort of decline for viewers between the
ages of 12 and 24. In homes with Internet access, television use by
those younger viewers declined by 6.8 percent from 1996 to 1997.
Television use by young people without Internet access remained
constant.

ACCESS TO CLINTON DATA ABETS E PLURIBUS UNUM, '90S STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By AMY HARMON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tim Ericson was not one of the millions of Americans scrolling
through the report by the independent counsel Kenneth Starr in
cyberspace last week. He read it in his local paper. Nor does he
plan to waste bandwidth downloading the videotape of President
Clinton's testimony when it is made available this week.
</P>
<P>
   But Ericson, a 33-year-old graphic designer from St. Paul, has
spent hours composing and absorbing a flood of e-mail about the
report from an online discussion group of about 400
fellow-Minnesotans. ``People have very different opinions, and I
haven't seen anyone giving way too much,'' Ericson said. ``But it's
only been a week. Our debate over carrying concealed weapons has
been going on heavily for months.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress' decision last week to release Starr's report over the
Internet was seen as a defining moment for the global computer
network, a test of both its technical infrastructure and its
ability to play a critical role in the political process.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the ad hoc experiment in electronic democracy was
a success. The extraordinary run on government and news sites _ by
one count, 20 million Americans had read parts of the report online
within 48 hours of its release _ reflected a public thirst for
instant, unfiltered information driven in part by the technology
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The sprawling web of chips and fiber strained under its heaviest
load ever but did not snap.
</P>
<P>
   But as part one of the stampede for the Starr report abates and
Webmasters brace for part two _ the expected release of the
videotape on Monday _ the real test of the Internet as a tool of
citizenship lies in politics beyond scandal and salacious details.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we'll see millions of people downloading
Social Security reform legislation, but we could,'' said Jonah
Seiger, co-founder of Mindshare Internet Campaigns
(www.mindshare.net), a political consulting firm based in
Washington. ``This event on the Internet is changing the way people
perceive their role in our political system.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, invented as a communications network for
scientists and academics and financed by the Department of Defense,
has had plenty of other milestone moments in the last three years
as it evolved into a mass medium and a global platform for
everything from electronic commerce to dating.
</P>
<P>
   When Diana, Princess of Wales, died in a car crash last year,
people the world over convened in cyberspace to mourn. When NASA
published Pathfinder's first pictures from Mars last summer,
millions logged on for a glimpse of the red planet. And when the
stock market took a nosedive last month, traffic surged to record
highs at some financial Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the first time in an unfolding national political
crisis, the Internet has become a place to turn both for
information and debate.
</P>
<P>
   From the rumors of President Clinton's affair with an intern,
first reported in January on the Web site of the Internet gossip
columnist Matt Drudge, to the revelation last week by the online
magazine Salon of Rep.Henry Hyde's extramarital affair 30 years
ago, the Internet has played a central and controversial role in
informing the public about the presidential sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   And at least for the moment, the medium seems inseparable from
that particular message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newspapers go out with the recycling,'' said Jonathan
Zittrain, executive director of the Berkman Center for Internet and
Society at Harvard University. ``Once it's on the Web digitally,
your sister-in-law can send you the best parts by e-mail. It forces
a level of engagement with the primary material there's no way you
would have had otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   For Marilyn Lyon, 54, of Mission, Kan., who read Starr's report
on the Internet the day it appeared, there is another advantage.
``The news today is so loaded with emotion and opinion that it
irritates me.'' Ms. Lyon said. ``This way I can read it without
commercials popping in all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet online activists warn that surfing the Web for alternative
news sources is very different from using the Internet to forge
political consensus over an issue as fraught with emotion as the
impeachment of a president. Access to raw data may make for a more
informed electorate, but not necessarily a more united one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy means more than just reading a document,'' said
Steven Clift, chairman of Minnesota E-Democracy, the group that
runs the e-mail list that Ericson subscribes to. ``What will
determine how the Internet does is what happens in the next few
months as we move from the reading phase to the discussing phase.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some longtime ``netizens'' argue that many Americans have formed
an Internet political habit that will extend beyond the current
scandal _ and beyond the Internet. Others argue that to exploit the
democratic potential of the medium, legislators will have to do
more than just publish the occasional high-profile document online;
they may actually have to interact in cyberspace with their
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sure would be nice to see Congress come out on the Net a
bit and talk to people about these things,'' said Clift. He noted
that the Web site where the House of Representatives published the
Starr report has no area for discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in private e-mail, on Web site forums and chat rooms and
voluntary online polls, Americans found a way to type their
politics into the ether in record numbers all last week.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Clift tried to direct his discussion list back to
its regular diet of Minnesota politics, with only limited success.
It was a phenomenon not unique to Minnesota: As of Friday morning,
subscribers to America Online had posted more than 400,000 messages
in the area set aside for discussion of the president's affair with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conversations over the dinner table are fleeting,'' said Barry
Schuler, America Online's president for interactive services.
``With message boards, what you have is a real-time
member-published journal. Especially with a topic where there's so
much dissonance, it helps to have an ongoing dialogue that's taking
shape over time.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, part of the Internet's appeal is that it resonates
with an American political ideal of unfiltered, unmediated
communication. Now, at a time when national political participation
has been at one of its lowest ebbs _ turnout in the November
election is expected to be sparser than ever _ there is some hope
among the politically and digitally inclined that expanded access
to the Internet will encourage a more activist electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I find most interesting about all of this is the way in
which the Internet has changed our expectations,'' said Jeffrey
Eisenach, president of the conservative Progress and Freedom
Foundation. ``It makes people expect information about government
and everything else to be available instantly and at almost no
cost.''
</P>
<P>
   But the recent events in Washington have been exploited for
commercial purposes as well. Already, marketers have used the Starr
report in mass e-mailings known as spam as a way to tempt consumers
to read advertising pitches.

COMBINED PHONE AND PALM PILOT IMPRESSES TECHNO-ELITE  
 MICROSOFT WORD AS PUNDIT  
 WHAT'S IN A WEB NAME? SOMETIMES MISTAKEN IDENTITY

<P>
   A Combined Phone-Palm Pilot Impresses the Techno-Elite
</P>
<P>
   Mixing technical and political evangelism, the annual Telecosm
conference, sponsored by George Gilder and his libertarian friends
from Forbes magazine, is one of the highest-powered gatherings of
technology experts in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But at last week's conference, held at Lake Tahoe, Calif., the
most provocative moment came not on the ballroom stage but when
Paul Jacobs, a top executive for Qualcomm Inc., conducted a
private, late-night demonstration of his company's latest creation:
a digital wireless phone fully integrated with a Palm Pilot
hand-held computer.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, who runs Qualcomm's consumer products group, was willing
to show off the new unit because it will be formally introduced
Monday _ although it will not be widely available until next year.
If the new Qualcomm product, called the pdQ, lives up to Jacobs'
demonstration, it could become the most popular item among the
techno-elite since the Palm Pilot itself.
</P>
<P>
   But the potential importance of the pdQ goes beyond novelty.
Digital experts these days are betting that the ultimate challenge
to Microsoft's desktop dominance will not come at the desktop but
from mobile devices that blur the line between computing and
communications. The pdQ could be the first to fulfill that vision.
</P>
<P>
   The potential pdQ applications range from e-mail messages that
will automatically dial a phone number to wireless stock trading
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The pdQ is smaller, lighter and easier to use than the Nokia
9000 Communicator, the first integrated phone and hand-held
computer. In the next week Qualcomm intends to distribute
programming tools to help the thousands of enthusiastic Palm
developers come up with new applications to take advantage of the
integration of wireless communications features into the
traditional Palm Pilot.

   Microsoft Word as Pundit: Software Maker Says It Isn't So
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has been buzzing with all sorts of pranks and
trivia related to President Clinton's troubles. But an e-mail tip
that was widely circulated last week made the programmers of
Microsoft Word, the word-processing software, seem predictive.
</P>
<P>
   The tip was this: Type the sentence ``I'd like to see Bill
Clinton resign'' in a Word document, highlight it, and then run it
through the program's thesaurus (with the key combination Shift-F7
or by selecting Tools-Language-Thesaurus from the task-bar menu).
The waggish thesaurus retorts with the phrase ``I'll drink to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, the trick works even in versions of Word that predate
Clinton's election to the White House. Did political oracles help
compile Word?
</P>
<P>
   No. As it turns out, the Word thesaurus issues the same response
with the phrases ``I'd like to see Bill Gates go broke'' and ``I'd
like to see my stocks go up'' _ and any other phrase beginning with
simply ``I'd ....'' People closely familiar with Word have known
about the quirk for years. Apparently, one of them recently started
spreading the Clinton resignation item.
</P>
<P>
   Planting hidden pranks in software is a time-honored
programmers' tradition, of course. And Microsoft Word is known to
have its fair share of these. Run the sequence of letters ``zzzz''
through Word's spell-checker, for example, and the program suggests
that you really meant to type ``sex.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``I'll drink to that'' wasn't the result of programmer
mischief. Rather, explained John Duncan, a Microsoft product
manager, the natural-language thesaurus in Word offers phrases,
listed alphabetically, that it considers to be possible
alternatives for the word used.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he explains, the natural-language feature, in the
effort to simulate conversational human speech, unknowingly gets a
little too creative.
</P>
<P>
   In all but the latest edition of Word, for example, if a user
checks the phrase ``Unable to follow directions'' with the
thesaurus, the first suggested alternative is ``Unable to have an
erection.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan said the latest version of Word omits these two
potentially embarrassing phrase suggestions. ``We want to be
sensitive to customers,'' he said.

   What's in a Web Name? Sometimes, Mistaken Identity
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Woods, the owner of an Internet service provider to Raleigh
and Durham, N.C., has discovered that using an address, or domain
name, that people associate with a well-known company may not be
worth the free publicity that comes with mistaken identity. He owns
delta.com, a domain name he chose in 1993 for his company,
Deltacomm Internet Services.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, nearly everyone who comes to his Web site
(www.delta.com) is really looking for the site of Delta Air Lines _
sometimes as many as 10,000 people a day. Over the years, as
traffic on the World Wide Web has meant more and more mistakes,
Woods has tried to sell the address to Delta Air Lines. But the
airline, which does business on the Web as www.delta-air.com, has
repeatedly rejected his asking price as too high.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said he had lowered the price, to a ``five-figure
amount,'' which he contends will barely cover the cost of
reprinting brochures and manuals and changing his customers' e-mail
addresses to a new domain.
</P>
<P>
   Because he pays another Internet company to carry his Web site's
traffic, Woods says, he is incurring extra costs to redirect
Delta's traffic. And he says he gets no extra advertising value
from most of the people who visit in search of the airline, because
his business serves only customers in the Raleigh-Durham area.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines disputes Woods' economics. ``His asking price is
much higher than his cost to migrate his customers,'' a spokesman,
Kip Smith, said. ``We don't feel that Delta should subsidize his
business interests.'' And besides, Smith said, Delta Air Lines has
a recognized Web address that has been in place since December
1995. ``We're really not interested in pursuing it, although we are
always open to discussion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently. The airline recently acquired another Web-site name,
www.deltaairlines.com from Dennis Toeppen, a speculator in Internet
names, who had originally registered it along with 100 or so other
corporate names. Delta would not comment on the terms of that deal.
</P>
<P>
   After one conversation with Delta that did not go to his liking,
Woods removed all links to Delta Air Lines' official site. But he
soon received so many complaints that he restored the link.
</P>
<P>
   To goad Delta, he also stuck in a link to its main rival,
American Airlines, with a free testimonial that reads, ``If you're
looking for an airline, try American Airlines, the frequent-flier
airline the owners and staff of Deltacomm Internet Services flew
100,000 miles on in 1997.''

YEAR 2000 COMPROMISE BILL OPPOSED BY TRIAL LAWYERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A compromise effort by Congress and the Clinton
administration to promote candid information about year 2000
problems in the United States' computers is being assailed by trial
lawyers because a cornerstone of the plan would grant computer and
chip makers immunity from liability suits.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of proposed legislation say such immunity is needed
to encourage high-technology companies to acknowledge hidden
problems that could cause computers and electronic devices to
malfunction on Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argue that the bill would allow thousands of companies
to shirk their responsibilities for having sold products that cause
problems ranging from the merely annoying to the catastrophic, or
having made repairs that failed to fix the problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this bill does is lower the standard of care for a
supplier,'' Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., said during heated Senate
Judiciary Committee debate.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would protect companies by allowing them to issue
written statements about their readiness for the year 2000, or Y2K,
with the guarantee that the statements could not be used as an
admission of liability in court unless the information was provided
recklessly or with the intention to deceive.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to make it easier for businesses to hold candid
conversations with suppliers, vendors and others, supporters say.
In addition to protecting companies from suits, it protects them
from antitrust violations when sharing information on year 2000
flaws.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With revenue of $12.36 billion in 1997, profits in the music
business have been essentially flat for the last few years. So,
lured by an online music market that the research firm Jupiter
Communications predicts will reach $2.8 billion a year by 2002, the
record industry, from producers to retailers, has struggled with
how to take advantage of Internet technologies to realize better
margins.
</P>
<P>
   After experimenting with audio, video, live ``Webcasts'' and
other multimedia technologies, the vanguard of the new-media
recording industry says it is poised to employ the Internet to
radically alter the way tomorrow's artists will be sold, promoted
and even discovered.
</P>
<P>
   But like everything on the Internet, there is no road map to
profits from online music. On the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, two
very different pioneers are blazing divergent paths to the future.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, N2K Inc. was formed in 1996 as a complete online
music and entertainment endeavor with a huge retail music store,
its own record label and magazine-type content organized around
communities of shared musical tastes and interests _ jazz,
classical, rock and country.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most start-ups in the Internet world, N2K is headed not
by youngsters with more vision than experience but by respected
longtime players in the music industry.
</P>
<P>
   Across the county and in another universe financially _ but just
a mouse click away on the Web _ is Red Button, a San
Francisco-based company founded last spring as a platform for
unknown bands to distribute their music. Recently, the company
shifted into recording and artist management.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing these two companies have in common is a
desire to make a business out of music and an unwavering belief
that the Internet is the place to do it.
</P>
<P>
   N2K's leaders were adapting new technologies to the recording
business long before there was an Internet. Its chief executive,
58-year-old Larry Rosen, founded GRP Music, the label that
introduced all-digital recordings for CDs in 1982. It was sold to
MCA Inc. in 1990 for $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   A great deal of the company's creative force stems from Phil
Ramone, one of the recording industry's premier producers. The
first to use Dolby four-track discrete sound in 1976, two decades
later Ramone was the first to use a fiber-optic system known as
EDNet to record simultaneous performances at different locations
for the Frank Sinatra Duets I and II albums. This month, Ramone
moved into a senior executive position on the corporate side of
N2K. In his new role, he will use the promise of Internet
distribution and promotion to attract established artists.
</P>
<P>
   N2K's mainstay is Music Boulevard, an online music store that
has evolved into the nexus for a network of online music channels,
including Rocktropolis, Jazz Central Station and Classical
Insights, not to mention myriad sites of major artists, including
Stones World and the Miles Davis site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about dealing with more and more artists,'' Rosen said.
``Recently, we signed Wynton Marsalis, exclusively for the
Internet, for his performances online.''
</P>
<P>
   Though N2K did not sign Marsalis, the Grammy award-winning jazz
trumpeter, to a conventional recording contract, it will manage his
online presence and produce his cyberconcerts. The Internet, Rosen
said, is ``a new place for artists to expand _ and not in conflict
with a recording contract'' with another label.
</P>
<P>
   Music Boulevard, the major source of N2K's $17.14 million in
revenue for the first half of this year, is among the most
successful online music retailers, offering some 300,000 titles.
While the company had an operating loss of $30.14 million for the
half-year, Rosen says that N2K is on track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our investors are in for the long run,'' he said. With 80.2
million page views and 130,000 new customers in the second quarter,
Rosen said he expected to turn a profit in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the company's original label, N2K Encoded, which
markets its recordings through traditional retail outlets, it
recently created an imprint, Digital Artists, which will record
established artists who the company feels can best benefit from
online marketing, promotion and digital delivery, in addition to
traditional retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen said the plan was to construct a suite of recording,
distribution and online environments to cultivate tomorrow's stars,
not one-hit wonders. N2K broke new ground last year selling the
Tragically Hip's album ``Live Between Us'' solely online. On Sept.
21, Musicblvd.com will debut and sell Dave Stewart's ``Sly Fi
Mission Control'' album exclusively on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   On the West Coast, Red Button is a shoestring start-up led by
Jake Sloane, 51, who recalls that the company was originally
developed ``to play independent artists' music to the World Wide
Web audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Using an electronic distribution method similar to Music
Boulevard's ``e-mod'' online music delivery system, Red Button
sells CD-quality downloads over the Internet using a technology
known as Liquid Audio. However, the company's primary direction
quickly changed, recognizing opportunities in the electronic world
to begin redefining traditional roles in music.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Braden Merrick, Red Button's 26-year-old vice
president for marketing, decided to invest start-up capital in a
new San Francisco band called Brando. Upon signing a two-year
management contract for 20 percent of Brando's revenues, Red Button
evolved instantly from an online music store to an artist
management company and an independent label.
</P>
<P>
   For an investment in Brando of $16,000, Red Button first placed
the band on its Web home page, offering Liquid Audio singles of
just two songs. The money paid for an eight-track tape recorder, a
mixing console and some microphones, plus a small contribution to
the quartet's living expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two months after the band's Web site went live and
Brando finished recording six new songs, the quartet came to the
attention of 26-year-old Gary Savelson, who four months earlier had
started a free e-mail newsletter called ``Demo Diaries'' devoted to
chronicling unknown bands that he discovers, often on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Each Monday, Savelson focuses on two bands that he believes show
promise and e-mails his newsletter to some 300 people at
established record labels.
</P>
<P>
   Within a week of Savelson's profile of Brando, Red Button's
office fielded calls and e-mailed inquiries from some 40
established record labels, including Geffen, Arista, Reprise and
Dreamworks, said Red Button's Merrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some Liquid Audio singles were sold,'' Sloane said. But in one
measure of how far the industry is from accepting online
distribution, he added, ``All the labels received CDs in the mail,
at their request.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Loftus, Brando's lead singer and song writer, said of Red
Button: ``We're the guinea-pig band _ willingly. This is just an
opportunity for all the good bands out there not to have to wait
for a record deal.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After more than a year of heated debate within the
government, the Federal Trade Commission has all but decided that
it is going to part company with the Clinton administration over
the contention that business can regulate itself when it comes to
Internet privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are losing patience with self-regulation,'' David Medine,
an associate director in the commission's Bureau of Consumer
Protection, said in an interview, reflecting the larger agency
opinion on this issue. ``It's too bad, but I think industry has
lost the opportunity to show that they will do it on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   What was the last straw? Within the FTC, they called it ``the
Big Surf.''
</P>
<P>
   From all corners of the agency's headquarters in the spring,
dozens of lawyers trooped to special training rooms equipped with
personal computers and high-speed Internet connections. And for two
weeks, they spent their days trolling the World Wide Web, searching
for privacy problems.
</P>
<P>
   Their intention was to find Web sites that collected personal
information from visitors but neglected to post any notice about
how that information would be used. The presumption was that many
of the companies sold the information _ some of it highly personal
data on health, income and personal preferences _ to Internet-list
brokers, merchants and advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   The ``surfers'' had no idea what they would find; no one had
ever dedicated the time and manpower needed for this sort of
targeted survey of the vast, tangled, largely unfathomable network
that is the World Wide Web. But the Big Surf produced startling
results published in a report this summer. More than 90 percent of
the roughly 1,400 sites examined collected personal information
from visitors, but only 14 percent of them disclosed how that
information would be used, convincing the FTC that formal
regulation would probably be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, the Clinton White House had been saying
that businesses using the Internet should be allowed to regulate
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's ever an arena that should be market driven, this is
it,'' Ira Magaziner, President Clinton's adviser on Internet
issues, said as the White House announced its Internet policy last
year.
</P>
<P>
   But while the White House was formulating this strategy, a few
blocks away at the FTC _ an independent federal agency not beholden
to the administration _ agency officials were conducting hearings
and workshops on Internet privacy, listening to complaints from
members of Congress and interest groups. They were also installing
up-to-date computer equipment so the agency could carry out the Big
Surf and add the Internet to the list of business arenas subject to
FTC scrutiny and enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with results from the Big Surf and the industry's reaction
to it in hand, several senior FTC officials said, the agency will
give industry just a few more months to respond to the
recommendations in its report by demonstrating that it is
effectively regulating itself.
</P>
<P>
   Medine said he would expect the industry to conduct a survey
like the Big Surf and hand over the results. If, as most commission
officials expect, industry does not provide such proof, the FTC
will draft a bill calling for clear Internet privacy standards and
ask Congress to pass it.
</P>
<P>
   As an independent agency, the commission does not have to get
permission from the Clinton administration to do this. And, given
Congress' repeated statements of concern about Internet privacy, a
bill would probably get the votes needed to pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not our intention to over-regulate,'' said Jodie
Bernstein, director of the agency's consumer protection bureau.
``We don't want to chill new technologies.'' But, she added, Web
sites must begin ``telling consumers if they are collecting
personal information, what they are going to do with it and how the
consumers can get out of it, if they want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, that means posting a privacy statement that answers
these questions. But since the results of the Big Surf were
published in June, commission lawyers have begun to believe that
some Web sites are actually choosing not to post privacy
statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's now a perverse, reverse incentive,'' said Ori Lev, an
FTC official involved in Internet enforcement. ``If you don't post
a privacy policy, we can't go after you.''
</P>
<P>
   That became clear last month, after the commission reached a
settlement with Geocities, a popular site on the World Wide Web
that the commission had accused of lying to its 2 million
subscribers. The site offered a privacy statement that promised not
to give out personal information collected during registration
without permission. But the commission found that Geocities was
selling the information anyway. That supposed deception was the
basis for the government's case.
</P>
<P>
   If Geocities had not promised to keep the information private,
then it would probably not have run afoul of the FTC. As a result,
Medine said, ``clearly there are a lot of corporate lawyers
advising their Web clients not to do anything now'' _ not to post a
privacy statement or anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Connie LaMotta, a senior vice president with the Direct
Marketing Association, calls that idea nonsense. ``It's a very
bureaucratic way of thinking,'' she said. ``It's upside down.
Businesses want to post privacy statements to establish good
customer relationships and customer service. Industry is stepping
up to the plate on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. LaMotta said she and others in the industry agreed with the
FTC's stated Internet privacy goals. But Ms. LaMotta added that she
was certain that businesses could accomplish the task on their own.
``It's our experience that, when you tap them on the shoulder,
change happens. They say: `Oh, gosh. OK.'''
</P>
<P>
   With just a few minutes' effort, most anyone can find a Web site
that collects personal information from visitors, in registration
or order forms, without disclosing how that information will be
used. But how those sites respond when asked about this can differ
markedly.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
NYT-09-20-98 1731EDT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A site called Soccer Patch (www.soccerpatch.com) is a trading
post for soccer-playing children who want to trade team patches. It
lists the names, e-mail addresses and in some cases the hometowns
of children who want to trade patches. That is a red flag for FTC
enforcers. They worry that child molesters can use the information
to find victims.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as a reporter asked Philip Rubin, president of Edge of
Chaos, the company that manages the site, about this, he
immediately promised to change the policy. And a few days later, he
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now require all contributors to provide us with signed
permission letters before e-mail addresses/and or names can be
posted,'' he said. ``Contributors under the age of 18 must provide
a form signed by their parents or guardians.'' And the Soccer Patch
site posted the form so that it can be printed out and mailed.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal Honda, a Washington area car dealer, had a different
approach.
</P>
<P>
   The company, like many car dealers, posts a pre-qualification
form for auto loans, requesting a variety of personal information,
including income, debt load and the amount of rent or mortgage
payments. Nowhere on the site does the company say how that
information will be used. And when asked about that, the company
issued a statement saying, ``We will look at the issue with our Web
developer.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked two weeks later what had come of this, Rosenthal Honda did
not respond.
</P>
<P>
   FTC officials say they are investigating other Web sites and
will almost certainly file charges against other companies, as the
agency did with Geocities.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Forbes, 31, an FTC lawyer, found the Geocities problem and
spends most of his time working on Internet privacy issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally we get ideas from reading the trade press,'' he
said, as well as from ``looking at who is linking up with list
brokers; we get tips from interest groups, usenet news group
postings _ and complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, for one, disagrees with the idea that a Web site can
escape trouble if it simply decides not to post a privacy policy.
``If you don't make a visible statement,'' he said, ``that does not
mean there isn't an implied claim.''
</P>
<P>
   But while his agency and the rest of the government figure out
whether to push for new rules on Web privacy, Forbes sees a bit of
improvement on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying everything's great,'' he said. ``But there is
movement.''

MARKET GYRATIONS CAUSE ANXIETY IN SILICON ALLEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JANET STITES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In contrast to politics, in the world of
entrepreneurs, going public has fabulously positive connotations.
Many founders of start-ups set their sights on taking their
companies public before even filing their incorporation papers.
</P>
<P>
   Going public is how their investors make back their money _ and,
hopefully, then some. It is how entrepreneurs achieve real wealth,
if only on paper. It is how they will be judged for years to come.
It is the consummate measure of business success or failure.
</P>
<P>
   So consider the anxiety of Silicon Alley entrepreneurs like Jack
Hidary, Todd Krizelman, Stephan Paternot and Alan Andreini. All
four run high-profile Internet companies that filed papers in the
summer with the Securities and Exchange Commission to go public.
All have, to this point, capitalized on the innovation and
excitement of the Internet and helped to define the amorphous New
York new-media industry that has come to be known as Silicon Alley.
</P>
<P>
   But as the stock market continues to vacillate, all these men
face a quandary: to go or not to go. They have arrived at the ball
only to discover that the orchestra is taking a break.
</P>
<P>
   In all, six new-media companies in the New York area have filed
for public offerings, including Hidary's Earthweb, Krizelman's and
Paternot's theglobe.com and Andreini's Interworld, plus two New
York companies, Multex and Net Grocer, and All-Tech Investment
Group of Montvale, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Under the SEC's quiet-period rules, the executives of those
companies are prohibited from discussing their situations, but
speculation in the Alley has been rampant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those that are in registration now will wait if they can do
so,'' predicted John Siracuse, vice president and head of East
Coast Internet banking for Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities.
``They don't want to be the first to test the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating the go/no-go question, Siracuse observes,
is that the window of opportunity is diminishing as the holiday
season approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult for small-cap companies to get the investors'
attention between Thanksgiving and Christmas,'' he said. If
companies wait until the new year to go public, he continued, they
will have logistical issues, like having to update their
prospectuses, but more important, they will have to wrangle with
the perception that they were not ready to go public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perception is reality,'' he said. ``And there will be the
perception they couldn't get the deal done.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Cohen, head of Internet research at Merrill Lynch,
believes many companies will turn to mergers and acquisitions. He
notes that mergers and acquisitions have been increasing in the
last six to 12 months anyway.
</P>
<P>
   And while there have been virtually no technology offerings in
the last few weeks, Cohen said, ``The landscape for Internet IPOs
has shifted, but the window is still open for high-quality
companies with compelling business models _ models such as
community and e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors want to see properties with components of high
functionality and high intellectual property,'' he said, saying
that theglobe.com is an example of a community site where users
create a wealth of intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists see the recent correction in technology
stocks as a much-needed dose of reality.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hirschfeld, a principal at Patricof &AMP; Co. Ventures Inc.,
which has interests in Alley-based Medscape Inc. and New
Jersey-based Audible Inc., says that the current market has not
diminished his firm's interest in the Internet and new-media
start-ups. But, he added, ``It does have an impact on price
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   The drop in the market, Hirschfeld says, brings a sense of
sanity to private market valuation.
</P>
<P>
   But it also leaves pre-public Silicon Alley companies in a
precarious position. If they are hard-pressed for cash, they may
have to turn to their original investors or go for a private
placement. They may have to pull their public offerings altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Siracuse adds that delayed initial public offerings can cause
problems back at the office. ``Employees who have other
opportunities may decide to leave the company,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A big issue for Silicon Alley is the fact that it is still being
judged by the number of successful public offerings. Each one is
tallied as younger companies continue to try to lure venture
capital from the West Coast, and to garner the respect of Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Siracuse agrees with Cohen that while the outlook may not be
peaches and cream, neither is it liver and onions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still an appetite for Internet stocks,'' he said.
``What the market needs is a high-profile Internet stock to go out
and do well.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock needs to sell out at its offering, Siracuse said, and
then continue to sell well in the after market.
</P>
<P>
   As for those companies that had already gone public, many
star-struck entrepreneurs and their option-holding employees found
out what their investors already knew: What goes up must come down.
Double Click Inc., an Internet advertising network and an Alley
favorite, watched its stock drop from more than $50 a share in July
to $23 last week. It closed Friday at $19.69.
</P>
<P>
   Double Click's chief competitor, 24/7 Media Inc., TFSM went
public in mid-August, opening at $18.50 and closing at $20.25. Last
week, its stock was selling below $12. It closed Friday at $11.56.
</P>
<P>
   Among other Alley stocks that saw their share prices drop into
single digits were N2K Inc., the owner of Music Boulevard, and
Cyber Shop Inc., an online mall.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Cohen, who has been following Silicon Alley companies
for the last three years, first as an analyst at Salomon Smith
Barney, then at the Union Bank of Switzerland, remains optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silicon Alley has come to be populated with good companies and
intelligent people and will continue to be a source of investment
ideas going forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Music to the ears of New York's high-technology entrepreneurs.

E-MAIL MESSAGES NOT SAFE FROM INVESTIGATORS' EYES, LEWINSKY FOUND
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By MARY BETH REGAN  
c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Released Monday as part of 2,800 pages of
Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr's supporting evidence, Monica
Lewinsky's e-mail messages read like a transcript of private
late-night chats with trusted friends.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a distraught Lewinsky dashes off a message to a
friend in Japan: ``So it's over. I don't know what I will do now
but I can't wait anymore and I can't go through all this crap
anymore. In some ways, I hope I don't hear from him (Clinton)
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many people, Lewinsky composed e-mail messages so personal
and candid it's unlikely she ever envisioned that anyone but her
friends would read them. But unlike telephone conversations, which
must be recorded to be preserved, e-mail messages automatically
live on in computer hard drives _ even if people who send them
don't realize it. For that reason, investigators are turning more
frequently to retrieved e-mail as evidence in court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are using e-mail as a substitute for telephone calls,''
said James X. Dempsey, senior staff counsel at the Washington-based
Center for Democracy and Technology. ``But they are also creating
records that are being used in civil and criminal proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt e-mail usage is skyrocketing. According to a
1998 Forrester Research Inc. report, for example, 15 percent of the
U.S. adult population, or about 30 million people, use e-mail. And
that figure is expected to surge to 135 million people by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, e-mail messages have the same protection as
first-class letters or phone calls. They cannot be intercepted in
transmission without a court order unless there is evidence of
wrong-doing.
</P>
<P>
   The catch occurs when e-mail messages are stored _ and they
become documents. They're stored either on the hard drive of the
sender or recipient, or on the hard drive of an inhouse server or
an Internet service providers (ISP), such as America Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost all messages obtained by the government are from stored
e-mail, not transmitted e-mail,'' Dempsey said.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible to delete e-mail messages from a hard drive, but
they don't usually disappear until they're over-written.
</P>
<P>
   At the onset of the Iran-Contra debacle, for example, National
Security Adviser John Poindexter went into his office one weekend
to delete 5,012 of his 5,062 stored messages. Oliver North erased
750 of his 758 messages. Still, these messages were recovered and
included as evidence because a low-level White House employee
decided not to overwrite backup tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A civil servant decided somebody might come looking for those
messages, `` said Tom Blanton, director of the non-profit National
Security Archive at George Washington University and author of
``White House e-mail: The Top Secret Computer Messages The
Reagan-Bush White House Tried to Destroy.''
</P>
<P>
   Commercial ISPs, such as AOL, also must turn over messages if
ordered to do so by courts. Tricia Primrose, AOL's spokeswoman,
said the company has a policy of giving customers 10 days' notice
in civil proceedings. It turns over records immediately in criminal
investigations. AOL keeps e-mail messages on its servers for
several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scary thing about e-mail is that it's got the immediacy of
a conversation but the permanence of a letter,'' says Blanton.
``Generally you don't want to write anything you wouldn't want to
see on the front page.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Lewinsky never got that advice.

Some simple tweaking will make Windows 98 a bit more speedy 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By now, many of you have a whole new set of problems.
</P>
<P>
   You have installed Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. This isn't going to be a diatribe (well, I
will rant just a little) against Windows 98. For one thing, most PC
users have very little choice in the matter. It's unlikely that
most of you will choose to run IBM's OS/2, or an old version of
DOS, or (despite its merits) Unix. That leaves Windows. And if
you're going to run Windows anyway, you might as well use the
latest version.
</P>
<P>
   If you're like me, you spent several years tuning up Windows 95.
Things like that take a lot of time and a lot of tweaking. Now you
have _ residing like a fat and happy infant _ a brand new and
untweaked version of Windows. Truth is, many new users would be
better off living in peace with that plain vanilla version. This
tweaking stuff can be as dangerous as going to a barber nicknamed
Shakey.
</P>
<P>
   So think of these as speed tips for cowards. Simple stuff that
almost anyone can do without worry they'll end up with a computer
that doesn't compute. We won't discuss hardware tips today, since
we've already talked _ in earlier columns _ about the speed
benefits of adding more RAM or a better video card.
</P>
<P>
   First make sure you take advantage of the defragmenter utility
that comes with Windows 98. Earlier versions of Windows _ even the
last few versions of DOS _ included a defragmenter. But this one is
truly better. Like the earlier versions, it does its best to
assemble programs so that they are stored in one place on your hard
disk. That makes them run faster and more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   But the Windows 98 version actually has some built-in
intelligence. It's smart enough to keep track of the programs you
run most frequently. And when you defragment the disk, it places
these most-often-used programs in areas of the hard disk that can
be accessed the fastest.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of this sort of defragmenting come gradually. Over
time, as you continue to defragment the disk, programs are stored
most efficiently. Eventually the programs you use most often will
load and run the fastest. That comes at the expense, of course, of
speed for the programs you don't use as often. But it's a good
trade-off for most of us.
</P>
<P>
   The next thing to do is to take a good, hard look at your hard
disk. If it's nearly full, you can bet the lack of space is slowing
your PC. Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   Windows uses some of your free hard-disk space to temporarily
store information in a place called a swap file. This information
is swapped _ hence the name _ back and forth as it is needed. That
keeps the information handy and makes your computer run faster.
</P>
<P>
   But if the swap file is tiny, your PC is forced to limit the
amount of information it squirrels away and things get snail-slow.
Here's a general rule of thumb: Make sure the free space on your
hard disk is at least twice as big as the amount of RAM you have.
For instance, my home machine has 64 megabytes of RAM. That means
that _ at a bare minimum _ I need 128 megabytes of free hard disk
space. And up to a limit, more free space is even better.
</P>
<P>
   The next hint offers a slight sacrifice in display quality and a
giant improvement in speed for most folks. Use the Control Panel's
Display Properties box (right click on the desktop, select
Properties, then click on the tab that says Settings) to lower the
number of colors your monitor uses. Most programs won't look much
different when the 256-color setting is selected _ instead of
settings for High Color or True Color. (It's just as easy to set
the display colors back to use more colors when you need that sort
of display for working with photographs or playing some games.)
</P>
<P>
   One last display tip that you can use while that same Properties
window is open. Click on the Background tab and remove the check
mark, if it's found, from the setting called Animate windows, menus
and lists. This will also add some speed.
</P>
<P>
   That's it for today. We haven't turned Windows 98 into a hot
rod, but these tips do offer more speed at almost no risk.

   If there's one thing that's certain about PCs, it's that sooner
or later they break down. The October issue of PC World devotes its
cover story to how to figure out what's wrong and fix it. Better
yet, the issue offers tips on how to improve the performance of PCs
that are working. There are tips on such things as speeding up the
performance of your hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   The same issue of PC World also takes a look at the latest
generation of palmtop computers. Once again, 3Com's PalmPilot wins
top honors among the four handheld computers reviewed by PC World.
The magazine found it the fastest and easiest to use, although it
found plenty of room for improvement. In contrast, PC World found
the newest handheld computers using Windows CE to be sluggish and
complex.

Tiny organizer stands tall 
By John Ghirardini  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For most of this century, bigger was better and biggest was
best, whether the topic was a new ocean liner or a record zucchini.
</P>
<P>
   But that course has been reversed in the digital age. Small now
stands tall.
</P>
<P>
   And nothing is standing taller than Franklin Electronic
Publishers' Rex Pro PC Card organizer, which the New Jersey company
bills as the world's smallest. The credit-card-size device, which
is only 1/4-inch thick, now has data entry and editing capability
for the road warrior on the go. The Pro will hold up to 6,000
records _ contacts, calendar, to-do lists and memos _ in its 512K
of RAM. It also includes both a home clock and world clock.
</P>
<P>
   The six-button organizer uses the SuperKey Light Data Entry
System to enter data directly, and TruSynch Plus software from
California-based Starfish Software for communicating with popular
personal information manager applications, such as Microsoft
Outlook 97/98, Lotus Organizer 97/97GS, Act!, Schedule+ and
Sidekick 98.
</P>
<P>
   Users can plug the 1.4-ounce Pro into a laptop's PC Card slot to
instantly access their PIM data, which is then displayed on the
LCD. A docking station connects to a desktop PC's serial port to
let the user instantly synchronize data.
</P>
<P>
   The device runs on a pair of lithium batteries good for six
months of normal use.
</P>
<P>
   The Pro retails for about $230, and includes the serial docking
station (three AAA batteries included) and a leather case.
</P>
<P>
   The butterfly effect
</P>
<P>
   Chaos.
</P>
<P>
   That's the opposite of what we expect of our digital servants,
which happily live in a world populated only by zeroes and ones and
excel at linear, either-or outlooks and solutions. To do this,
computers move electrical impulses along preordained, unvarying
circuits.
</P>
<P>
   Computers have a kinship with physics. There are very few
problems dealing with the regular movement of objects physicists
and mathematicians can't solve. These are described by what are
called ``linear equations,'' and mathematicians have been solving
such equations for hundreds of years.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other types of events physics has never been able
to handle, says mathematician Ian Malcolm _ turbulence, for
example. Water flowing out of a spigot. A leaf falling through the
air. Weather systems. Turbulent events are ``nonlinear equations.''
They're nearly impossible to solve. So physics came up with a
description about 10 years ago: ``chaos theory.''
</P>
<P>
   In a breakthrough that may not surprise those who have stared at
their computer screen in utter disbelief over a completely
unexpected result, physicists at Georgia Tech and the Institute of
Mathematical Sciences in Madras, India, have come up with a
computing technique that uses a network of chaotic elements to
``evolve'' an answer. The method was detailed in the Sept. 4 issue
of Georgia Tech Research News.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a glimpse of how we can make common dynamic systems
work for us in a way that's more like how we think the brain does
computation,'' said William L. Ditto, a physics professor at
Georgia Tech. ``It's an entirely new computing paradigm.''
</P>
<P>
   In a basic example, values of three and four would be encoded
into a system set with a critical value of one. The values would
create an imbalance that would ``avalanche'' through the chaotic
elements until it was ushered out of the system as the value of
seven. (If you don't completely follow that, don't fret. It is,
after all, chaos).
</P>
<P>
   Development of a practical system based on the paradigm is a
long way off, if it ever occurs, but stay tuned: When it comes to
something based on chaos theory, the next time a butterfly in the
Amazon rain forest flaps its wings, everything may change.
</P>
<P>
   They call it cyber-love
</P>
<P>
   Personal ads for singles have become a staple of the Internet,
and the site holding a sizable quiver of Cupid's arrows is
Dallas-based One &AMP; Only, according to Media Metrix, an online
audience measurement service.
</P>
<P>
   One &AMP; Only (http://oneandonly.com) offers singles a database of
romance profiles featuring 150,000 ads. The ad database is swept
monthly to remove bad e-mail addresses and make sure no duplicate
profiles are included.
</P>
<P>
   The service caters to singles seeking an upscale alternative to
the supermarket and bar scenes, the company says. The typical One &AMP;
Only user, according to the company, is a 35-year-old
college-educated white-collar professional. Placing an ad is free,
but to respond to romance profiles users can join the All You Can
E-Mail Club for as little as $14.95 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The Rex Pro PC Card organizer will hold up to 6,000 records _
contacts, appointments, chores and errands _ in its 512K of RAM.

Toys leap to life in action-movie game 
By Yusuf Davis  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Small Wonders'' was a huge hit in the Farris household, in
Mableton.
</P>
<P>
   The PC fighting game of action toys captivated reviewer Jesse
Farris, 12, and his brothers _ Jacob, 9, and Joseph, 8 _ with its
vivid graphics and fierce fighting action. For hours on end, the
Farris boys and several neighborhood friends waged battle against
enemy forces, knocking off different body parts until the final
blow is struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play it a lot,'' Jesse said. ``It's a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on this summer's popular action-adventure movie ``Small
Soldiers'', the storyline of ``Small Wonders'' is similar to the
film, but different enough to give players a new experience. There
are two different plots that unfold, based on the player's choice.
To win the battle, players must uncover new insights into each
character's strengths and weaknesses. Puzzles are layered within
each mission, requiring players to use their wits and
problem-solving skills. Gamers can create an original Commando or a
Gorgonite by choosing from a variety of bodies, heads, arms and
legs, each with unique battle advantages. New action figures can be
customized from hundreds of textures, colors and decals and
equipped with special battle accessories. Built and dressed for
battle, the soldiers are trained in their new moves, then it's off
to battle in one of five interactive 3-D environments.
</P>
<P>
   Creations can also be saved to disk and imported to play on a
friend's computer.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse said he really liked the graphics, but his favorite part
is that the game offers lots of options.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the fact that you not only play with the regular
characters, but you could create your own,'' he said. ``Another
good thing is that you can select different levels of play.''
</P>
<P>
   Recommended ages: 6 and up.
</P>
<P>
   Minimum PC system requirements: Pentium 100 MHz or higher, 16
megabytes RAM, 30 MB free hard drive space, 4X CD-ROM drive, 1 MB
SVGA card, sound card, mouse, DirectX v.5.

</P>
<P>
   Children's software maker Humongous Entertainment recently
``flipped the start switch'' on two new features to its redesigned,
award-winning http://www.humongous.com Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Families visiting the site can discover an exclusive new
``Making of Blue's Birthday Adventure'' feature dedicated to the
creation of the highly anticipated ``Blue's Clues'' CD-ROMs, plus a
new online weather game starring the world's youngest superhero,
Pajama Sam. The new Web site design makes it easy for kids to find
their favorite activities, the latest downloads and new features
every time they visit.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site also provides families with fun activities kids and
parents can enjoy together, both on and off the computer, said John
Uppendahl, Humongous Entertainment's vice president of
communications and online business development. Whether playing an
online mini-game, asking questions directly to Freddi Fish in
``Frankly Freddi'' or printing out a putt-putt car to color, cut
out and assemble, there are tons of activities that will keep
families entertained for hours.
</P>
<P>
   `Making of Blue's
</P>
<P>
   Birthday Adventure'
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue's Clues,'' the hit TV show for preschoolers, has made the
leap to CD-ROM. Curious families everywhere want to know, ``How'd
they do it?''
</P>
<P>
   In this new Web site feature, the software giant lets everyone
in on the secret by unveiling ``Making of Blue's Birthday
Adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   This feature describes the process behind the collaboration
between Humongous Entertainment and Nickelodeon, which created the
interactive CD-ROM experience for preschoolers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue's Birthday Adventure'' combines the unique playability of
Humongous Entertainment's award-winning software with the rich look
and multilayered educational experience of the TV show. It will
have preschoolers going back for more.
</P>
<P>
   `Pajama Sam's Wacky
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide Weather Report'
</P>
<P>
   Kids recently discovered in ``Pajama Sam 2: Thunder and
Lightning Aren't So Frightening'' that weather across the globe is
amok and the world's youngest superhero is on a mission to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with its wacky weather online game, Humongous Entertainment
provides kids a chance to create their own newspapers based on
``Pajama Sam's Wacky Worldwide Weather Report.''
</P>
<P>
   Pajama Sam asks kids to provide him with the names of some of
their favorite things, including food, color and TV show, and then
places the answers into a weather story. Kids can check out and
print these stories as they would appear in the local newspaper.
With a variety of hand-drawn illustrations and one-of-a-kind
stories, kids will have a blast as they prepare their weather
report again and again.

Take our Word for it, writing programs thrive 
By Charles Haddad  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite Microsoft Word's hegemony, Mac users have plenty of good
choices when it comes to writing programs. All are less expensive
than Word, which now costs a whopping $369.95, and offer most of
its features.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say Word is a bad program. It's just right for
many people _ but not all.
</P>
<P>
   What follows, then, is a quick look at the Mac's best writing
programs. It's an effort designed to help you pick the right
program, given your needs and budget.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with Word, which remains the most popular and
powerful program in terms of features. Word 98 may be the best
version of the program yet for the Mac. It's lightning fast
compared to its predecessors and, as always, chock-full of new
features. Word remains the only program that lets you create
interactive outlines and work collaboratively on one document.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, these strengths are offset by lots of weaknesses.
Word 98 works sluggishly on anything other than the fastest Power
Mac. Many of its features don't work well or as advertised. The
program is also buggy.
</P>
<P>
   None of Word's competitors suffer from these problems. And one
of the best writing programs may have come on your Mac.
</P>
<P>
   It's called AppleWorks, formerly ClarisWorks, and is a wonderful
program. No word processor is easier to use, whether writing a
letter or laying out a newsletter. Like Word, AppleWorks comes with
hundreds of templates for letters, resume and other documents.
</P>
<P>
   AppleWorks' weakness is a lack of advanced features. It won't,
for example, automatically correct typos or create indexes and
tables of content.
</P>
<P>
   Word has these features and so does Nisus Writer, which retails
for $99.95. Nisus is a powerful and innovative program with a
clean, simple interface that avoids the cluttering panels of
buttons favored by Word and AppleWorks.
</P>
<P>
   Nisus also lets you select and edit non-contiguous text, keep up
to 10 clipboards and undo a near endless number of steps at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Nisus' weaknesses are threefold. It can't make outlines and the
way it handles both tables and styles is clumsy. The program
doesn't come with a lot of templates.
</P>
<P>
   A less expensive alternative to Nisus is Mariner Write, which
retails for $69.95. It can't create a table of contents but lets
you easily manage styles and create tables.
</P>
<P>
   Mariner Write is lean, fast and responsive. It's a good choice
for laptops or older Macs.

From free stuff to shareware, surf Web 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today let's visit a store where shoplifting is encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there are literally thousands of stores like this.
They're all located on the Internet and each contains more software
than you could ever use. You're welcome to drop by and download as
much as your hard disk can hold.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, you'll be asked to pay a small registration fee
if you decide to keep and use the software (that's a category of
software called ``shareware'') but in other cases, you don't owe a
penny.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find the same kind of variety of software on the Net that
you'd see in a real store _ everything from games, to databases, to
word processors, to Internet software, to special purpose programs
for most jobs and hobbies.
</P>
<P>
   Since all of us have different interests, your best bet is to go
to one of these download sites and use keywords _ just as you would
to search the Web _ to locate the sort of programs that interest
you.
</P>
<P>
   There are an almost endless number of sites dedicated to storing
and organizing this free stuff. Instead of giving you a long list
of Web addresses, let me tell you about a single site that contains
hotlinks to some of my favorite download services.
</P>
<P>
   It's part of the Web site maintained by MindSpring, but you
don't have to be a member to use it. You'll find the collection of
links at
http://content.mindspring.com/sections/computing/download.html.
</P>
<P>
   Visit the library
</P>
<P>
   Since that list is exhaustive enough for most of us _ you'll
find sites offering shareware for Macintosh and Windows computers;
software for older machines running pure DOS, games that'll run on
that old Atari stuck away in the attic, some good programs for the
wireheads that use Unix and OS/2, and even source code (the raw
code just as it looked when created by the programmer) _ we won't
spend much more space offering addresses for additional sites.
Instead, let's talk about a few of the sites you'll find on this
link page.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us spend at least half of our computing time on the
Internet nowadays. Tucows (http://www.tucows.com) is a specialized
library of Internet software _ newsgroup readers, Web browsers,
e-mail programs and special utilities that measure the quality and
speed of your Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   Since Tucows has mirror sites (duplicate libraries of the
software) all across the world and nation, you should be able to
find a site near you to make it more likely the download will be
speedy.
</P>
<P>
   The next site, Shareware.com (http://www.shareware.com), does
the best job of offering software for almost any type of computer.
It's a good general purpose library with almost any kind of
software you can imagine. Macintosh users will be happy with the
good selection of Mac programs there.
</P>
<P>
   However, since Macintosh users are often shortchanged when it
comes to shareware, they'll also want to pay special attention to
Info-MAC HyperArchive (http://hyperarchive.lcs
</P>
<P>
   .mit.edu/HyperArchive.html), which offers nothing but Mac
programs.
</P>
<P>
   One program most new downloaders encounter, no matter what type
of computer they use, is a decompression program. It's needed
because most programs available for download have been
``compressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, all these sites offer programs that will decompress the
software. Since there are several programs that can be used _ and
since most are specific to the type of computer platform you use _
just search for the programs using the keyword ``compress.''

Economical Lumina PCC scans and copies in color 
By Jack Warner  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I wouldn't expect much from a machine that claims to copy and
scan, with an automatic document feeder and optical character
recognition, all for a list price of $250.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Lumina PCC, I was mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   The maker of this machine, Lumina Office Products, calls the
product a ``color copier.'' It would be more accurate to call it a
color scanner, since it isn't a color copier unless you've got a
color printer.
</P>
<P>
   It's a relatively small but very sturdy-seeming machine that
performs both flatbed and drum scanning. The flatbed area is only a
little larger than letter size, but the drum scanner _ used in
conjunction with the automatic document feeder _ will scan a
document 35 inches long. I don't know of anyone with a document 8.5
inches wide and 35 inches long, but if you're into scrolls, this is
the machine you need.
</P>
<P>
   The PCC connects your printer and your computer. For whatever
reason, it has no on-off button, which I find rather disconcerting.
After 90 minutes of idling, the scanner light goes out, cutting
down on power use and wear and tear. But I'd rather be able to turn
it off without unplugging it.
</P>
<P>
   Once set up, the machine automatically located my Lexmark 5700
printer.
</P>
<P>
   To make copies, you simply position the document to be copied on
the sheet feeder or on the glass of the flat scanner and press the
copy button on the machine. It's no speed demon, but you'll get
your copy out of your printer in a minute or so, and if your
printer is a decent one and in good shape, it'll be a good copy.
</P>
<P>
   It will make a color copy if you punch the color copy button.
</P>
<P>
   Copies can be scaled up or down, depending on what your printer
can handle. Up to 99 copies can be programmed.
</P>
<P>
   Scanning images, of course, is best done on the flatbed scanner
and involves the simple software that comes with the PCC. The
machine takes up to two minutes to calibrate itself before every
scan, which can be a little annoying, but for the price I could
acquire some patience.
</P>
<P>
   The software allows you to prescan the image on the bed and then
select a portion of it for copying. Once scanned, you can save it
in one of several standard graphic formats or drag-and-drop the
image into whatever image-handling software you have. Ulead iPhoto
Express comes with the machine.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't tell any appreciable difference between scans of the
same photograph made with the PCC and with our Microtek scanner.
</P>
<P>
   For optical character recognition _ turning an image into an
editable document _ you simply select that function in the
software. The OCR conversion, done by built-in software, is made
quickly and automatically, and the results are pretty good. You'll
have to do some editing, but with a good original it should be
minimal.
</P>
<P>
   It's here the automatic sheet feeder comes in handy. If you've
got 10 or 12 (or up to 99) sheets to scan, just drop them on the
feeder and they will be done sequentially.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to scan an image or document and then fax it
somewhere, the machine has a fax mode which will make automatic use
of your fax software and fax modem. It will also set up as an
attachment for e-mailing.
</P>
<P>
   The machine is pretty simple and the documentation, while
jumbled, is quite adequate. There is a ``guided tour'' in the
software; avoid it, it's more of a sales pitch then an aid for
someone who's already bought the product.
</P>
<P>
   If you already have a good printer _ it will work with laser
printers as well as ink jets _ the Lumina PCC will do some
yeomanlike work at a very reasonable price. Lumina has a Web page
at http://www.luminapcc.com.

DISNEY PLANNING INTERNET ENTRYWAY
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Walt Disney Co., in a major expansion of its
Internet presence, announced on Monday that it would launch an
easy-to-find Internet site called go.com later this year as one of
the entrance hubs on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment giant, which already has 9 million people
viewing its Web sites regularly, promised that its Go Network will
offer fast access to Disney sites, along with search and directory
services through its partnership with Web search specialist
Infoseek Corp. It proclaimed that go.com will become the
third-most-visited Web site behind only Yahoo! and American Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a lot of sense for Disney to use a name like this
that's easy to remember,'' said analyst Linda Bannister of Edward
Jones &AMP; Co. ``I think it's going to be very successful, given the
strength of Disney's marketing muscle.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney agreed in June to buy 43 percent of Infoseek for $70
million. The deal provided for $165 million in marketing support,
such as ads on Disney's ABC, ESPN and other networks. Analysts
believe Disney can use the worldwide appeal of its brand names and
characters to attract the millions of people who have not yet
become regular Internet users, particularly parents with children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, the Internet is probably going to have a couple of
major points of access, so there's still a lot of opportunity,''
said Sanford Bernstein analyst Tom Wolzien, who noted that fewer
than 30 million U.S. homes have Internet access. ``It's not too
late for a new player.''
</P>
<P>
   Go.com will make it more likely for Web surfers to detour on to
Disney's major sites such as Disney.com, ESPN Sports Zone and
ABCNEWS.com, leading to further promotion of its theme parks,
movies, merchandise and TV networks. ``With Go Network, we are
making clear that we intend to seize this opportunity and be just a
click away from consumers around the globe,'' Disney Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Michael Eisner said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The attraction of the Internet to media giants such as
Burbank-based Disney is growing because operators of directories
get to decide exactly what an Internet user initially views when
entering the World Wide Web.

EXPERTS SAY COPYRIGHT LAWSUIT COULD SET HARMFUL PRECEDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SETH ROSENFELD   
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a lawsuit that experts say threatens the
free-wheeling nature of the World Wide Web, a photographer claims
JC Penney Co. Inc. should be held liable because its Web site was
one of three ``links'' that ultimately led to an unauthorized
display of his photo of movie star Elizabeth Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity photographer Gary Bernstein's complaint contends the
department store, which advertises Taylor's ``Passion'' perfume on
its Web site, violated his copyright even though its own site did
not show his photograph.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit appears to be the first to claim a copyright
violation resulted from multiple linking, the main way of moving
about the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit reflects the convergence of technology, law and
public policy on the Web. It pits an artist's rights to prohibit
unauthorized use of his work against the Web's ability to link
sites virtually anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to define what the (copyright) protection will be
on the new medium,'' said Patrick Grannan, Bernstein's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Several experts said the lawsuit, if successful, could threaten
the essence of the Web, which relies on links to connect millions
of pages stored in separate computers around the world. Viewers
click on links, the underlined or colored words or icons on Web
pages, to move from one site to another, giving the Web its great
informational power.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the suit were upheld, it would be very bad for content on
the Web,'' said Hal Varian, dean of the School of Information
Management at the University of California at Berkeley. ``It would
have a chilling effect on links. The valuable thing about links is,
you point to contradictory material, or supporting material ... You
can build on what's been done before.''
</P>
<P>
   Shari Steele, a lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a
San Francisco-based nonprofit group that defends civil liberties on
the Internet, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole concept of surfing the Web is that you can go to one
site and click and go to another,'' she said. If Web operators are
liable for the content of sites they don't control, she said,
``they would be loath to link to it in the first place, and that
would completely destroy the way the Web works.''
</P>
<P>
   Copyright law prohibits copying or distributing someone else's
photographs, words or other creative works without permission.
People who infringe on copyrighted material may be ordered to stop
and to pay damages.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, JC Penney and Elizabeth Arden Co., the
maker of Passion, in November 1997 promoted the perfume with an
on-line chat on America Online with Taylor, the perfume's
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The chat site was linked to an Elizabeth Taylor-Passion perfume
page at a separate Web site run by JC Penney. On this page, viewers
could click on a biography link that took them to another Web site
run by Internet Movie Database Ltd., which featured information on
the movie star.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, they could click on another link that took them to a
Web site run by the Swedish University Network, which included two
photos of Taylor that had been taken by Bernstein. One _ the ``Pink
Lady'' _ showed Taylor in a pink outfit. Another _ ``the lavender
image'' _ showed her in a floral print dress.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein filed the lawsuit in April, claiming that he licensed
the Pink Lady to Elizabeth Arden Co. to promote the perfume for a
limited period that expired several years ago. The lavender image
appeared on the cover of a photography magazine in 1986 and also
was copyrighted, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit said JC Penney, Arden and Internet Movie Database
all violated Bernstein's copyright because _ through the links _
they reproduced or distributed the images on the Internet without
his permission.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, anyone in the United States who found the photos
through JC Penney's Web site and downloaded them also infringed on
the copyright, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Arden moved to dismiss the case, saying Arden had
no control over JC Penney's Web site and, even if it did, was not
responsible for photos shown on a site three links away in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plaintiff's untenable theory of infringement would bring
traffic on the Information Highway to a stand-still,'' a lawyer for
Arden said in a court brief.

IMPROVING HOME COMPUTER AUDIO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ROB FIXMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When shopping for a computer system, the last features that
buyers typically consider, if they consider them at all, are the
audio speakers. Most multimedia computers are equipped with a
pathetic pair of plastic-encased speakers of a fidelity about equal
to a clock radio.
</P>
<P>
   These acoustic toys are adequate because many computers sold
today are for offices, where any sound above two decibels is likely
to be too loud and anything that smacks of entertainment is frowned
upon.
</P>
<P>
   But the audio capabilities of today's Macintosh or Pentium-class
computers can match and in some ways exceed good high-fidelity home
stereo equipment. And for many home users, game enthusiasts or
people who use multimedia technologies for sales or other
presentations, a set of true high-fidelity speakers is desirable if
not essential.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, a sizable market has grown up around high-end
speaker systems for computers, with some of the most respected
brands in audio, including Altec-Lansing and Bose, offering
high-fidelity speakers that can transform a standard desktop
computer into a first-rate stereo sound system.
</P>
<P>
   The best of these speaker systems are highly directional in
order to take full advantage of the state of the art in so-called
dynamic or interactive 3-D audio _ technologies that trick the ear
into hearing sounds all around the head though they are coming from
speakers in front of the listener. In contrast, static 3-D audio,
or surround sound, achieves the three-dimensional illusion by
assigning stereophonic sounds to front and rear speakers, a
technology that is often worth the expense and effort in a home
theater environment but impractical for multimedia computer setups.
</P>
<P>
   With dynamic and interactive 3-D audio, spatial and directional
illusions are achieved by manipulating audio signals based on
knowledge of how our heads and outer ears interact with and modify
sounds arriving from different directions. By selectively delaying,
echoing or intensifying certain sounds and creating acoustical
collisions in which sounds cancel each other out to varying degrees
when reaching the ear, these technologies can achieve remarkable
acoustical illusions.
</P>
<P>
   These highly complex manipulations of sound are crucial to
gaming and other virtual reality environments in which every move
of a joystick can result in a different three-dimensional movement
within an infinite sphere of virtual directions. Any latency in the
audio response to such movements will greatly diminish the
illusion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the challenges of reproducing sound faithfully
across the audible spectrum, 3-D technologies require that speakers
be highly directional because real acoustical ambience _ that is,
the reflections and absorption of sound in our environment _
competes with the 3-D illusion at the outer portion of the ear, or
pinna, and muddies the cues interpreted as spatial perception.
</P>
<P>
   It is necessary to eliminate as many environmental variables as
possible, and directional speakers go a long way toward preventing
reflections of sound bouncing off desktops, monitors and walls.
</P>
<P>
   The most advanced design to satisfy all these demands on
computer speakers was introduced by the Sonigistix Corp. of
Vancouver, British Columbia. Its $229 system, known as Monsoon, is
designed to maximize the acoustic illusions of 3-D audio by
employing two highly-directional, flat-panel speakers that are
placed on either side of the user's monitor, plus a subwoofer unit
placed under the desk.
</P>
<P>
   The subwoofer combines bass sounds below 200 hertz from both
stereo channels. This does not impair the spatial illusion because
deep bass sounds are the least directional of all audio cues, which
is why it is much harder to determine the direction of a thunder
clap, for example, than the direction of a siren. For this reason,
almost all subwoofers produce bass in mono, although most make the
cut at 90 to 150 hertz.
</P>
<P>
   While the Monsoon's bass response is respectable, it is the
system's 4-inch by 8-inch flat-panel satellite speakers that are
truly impressive. The flat design _ only a half-inch thick _
projects sounds to the rear as well as forward and prevents most
sound reflections from objects on either side of the speaker. They
are also angled 30 degrees upward to eliminate reflections from the
surface of the desktop.
</P>
<P>
   As is the case with all computer speaker systems, the Monsoons
provide their own built-in amplifier. But it is impossible to know
how much power you are getting for your money, because Sonigistix
does not rate the output in RMS, or root mean squared, watts per
channel, which is the only honest measurement of power and the only
figure you can use in comparison shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their actual output, in three days of throwing every
audio source imaginable at them, the speakers, consistently
produced sound that rivaled the performance of high-end component
system speakers.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of fidelity, they were impressive within a broad
dynamic range, handling with equal agility the explosive climaxes
of Hayden's Concerto for Trumpet and Orchestra, subtle nuances of a
Yo-Yo Ma performance of Bach's Suite No. 3 for Cello and the
gut-pounding rhythm section of the bassist Ernest Ranglin's reggae
instrumentals.
</P>
<P>
   But where the Monsoons truly differentiated themselves was in
their articulation of 3-D audio. A demo of ``Grim Fandango,'' a
soon-to-be-released game from LucasArts, immersed the player in a
vivid cacophony of urban sounds triggered by the position and
movement of the on-screen character relative to sound sources and
reflective surfaces like buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, while the environmental illusions were remarkably
realistic, they were also limited to a relatively small listening
area. Audio fidelity was good anywhere within the room, but to
experience the full effect of 3-D audio, the listeners had to keep
their heads within the speakers' ``sweet spot'' _ the area where
the sounds meet in front of the monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The owner's manual offers very precise instructions for speaker
placement, because it is so crucial to the Monsoon's performance.
Yet, every listening environment will be different, so it is
necessary to experiment with the placement of the speakers, trying
several arrangements until the maximum spatial illusion is created
where your head is generally held while working at the computer.
</P>
<P>
   It is best to keep in mind that ultimately this is a matter of
preference. There is really no such thing as spatial fidelity,
because 3-D audio, like many other audio technologies, is as much
psychology as physics.
</P>
<P>
   Micron Electronics recently announced that it was shipping
Monsoons as standard equipment with its top-of-the-line Millennia
desktop systems and as optional equipment with its other computer
lines. Technical specifications and more information on the
speakers are available on line at http://www.monsoonpower.com.

Atlanta firm settles suit around Y2K 
By Mark Clothier  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An Atlanta company last week paid two Michigan grocers
$250,000 in what is being called the first settlement of a
Y2K-related lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Produce Palace International in suburban Detroit sued
Doraville's Tec America, alleging $65,000 worth of cash registers
and credit card verification machines from that company
malfunctioned when cards bearing the year ``00'' expiration dates
were used to pay for groceries.
</P>
<P>
   Tec America, the American subsidiary of Tokyo Electric Co.,
which is part of Toshiba, blamed the glitch on All-American Cash
Register of Inkster, a suburb of Detroit. That company installed
the system in 1995. The statement said Tec America's equipment has
accepted credit cards with 00 expiration dates since May 1997.
Fewer than 24 of the Tec systems are still in use nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with All-American Cash Register could not be reached
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Yarsike, Produce Palace co-owner, said the system crashed
more than 100 times in the first 500 days after the store opened in
1995. Yarsike and co-owner Sam Katz filed suit in July 1997 asking
for $1.8 million in damages, Yarsike said. Tec America lawyer
Joseph Hoover said the pair asked for as much as $5 million during
negotiations. The trial was to have started Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   The Produce Palace suit, filed in July 1997, was the first
individual Y2K suit filed in this country, said Dean Morehous,
chairman of the technology practice for the San Francisco offices
of Thelen Reid &AMP; Priest.
</P>
<P>
   Tec attorney Hoover contends the suit is not a Y2K issue. He
said the cash registers malfunctioned because Michigan banks issued
credit cards with 00 expiration dates before most banks, and that
the system's software was not updated soon enough. Hoover said
All-American did a poor job installing the system. Tec America is
suing All-American, which has counter-sued.
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 problem, or Y2K, prevents older software and
millions of embedded chips from reading the correct date after Dec.
31, 1999. In an era when memory was scarcer, programmers developed
computer systems that read dates in two digits. Unless fixed, older
systems will read the year 2000 as 00, which they consider to mean
1900.
</P>
<P>
   Produce Palace attorney Brian Parker, a Detroit-area lawyer who
specializes in automobile product liability, said Y2K is nothing
more than a high-tech lemon law matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all Y2K is,'' he said. ``They sold a product that you
didn't tell me was flawed. Now I have losses. People see computers
or technology and think it's confusing, but it's not. Y2K just
means someone screwed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Yarsike said the credit card problem usually would cripple the
system for 10 or 15 minutes, backing up checkout lines. The longest
the system was down was one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened continually,'' Yarsike said. ``We eventually
learned to do some things ourselves. Like reboot it and start it
back up. Most of the shutdowns were quick shutdowns, but they were
enough to create aggravation and havoc and things of that nature.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We got attorneys because they wouldn't repair the system,'' he
said. ``We got an attorney and it woke them up.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the settlement, Produce Palace sent the system back
to Tec America. Yarsike said Produce Palace bought their new system
from NCR.

   NEW YORK _ You have probably already read, and you can expect to
read a lot more in coming months, about something called Y2K.
Sounds like the secret ingredient for a miracle hair restorer.
Actually, it is a problem that is supposed to leave all us moderns
quaking in our Nikes, but has to bring a smile to anyone with mild
Luddite tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K is shorthand for the programming bug that will prevent
zillions of computers from recognizing the year 2000 when it comes
around because they were weaned on a two-digit system for dates.
This year, for instance, is rendered simply as 98, with the 19
assumed. Expectations are that many machines will go cross-eyed
with the approaching double-ought rollover, believing that we are
back in 1900 and not in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Terrible consequences have been predicted, from airplanes
falling out of the sky to investment portfolios being wiped out.
But even if you are among those who suspect the world will somehow
muddle through, you have to sneer at a technology that lacks the
sense God gave a desk calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Tytell had to laugh. Y2K? ``To tell you the truth,'' he
said the other day, ``it doesn't bother me at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course it doesn't. Computers are meaningless to Tytell, who
at 85 is one of the few remaining typewriter repairmen in New York
City. ``A dying breed,'' he will tell you. But dying is not dead,
and this breed is not ready for its obituary, not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Tytell has been building and repairing typewriters for 70 years,
the last 30 in a crowded shop up a flight from Fulton Street in
lower Manhattan. In his bow tie and white lab coat, a pen planted
in the breast pocket, he is master of a realm of cogs and key caps,
of rollers and ribbons, all competing for space with hundreds of
typewriters in English, German, Russian, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic,
Farsi, you name it.
</P>
<P>
   Every few years, someone with a pen and note pad climbs the
stairs to see how this throwback to the precomputer age is getting
along. The visitor is always rewarded with grand tales of how
Tytell and his wife, Pearl, verified documents by the typewriters
that were used, how during World War II they built machines in 145
languages for the U.S. Army, how an upside-down letter in Burmese
inadvertently installed by Tytell became the accepted standard for
all Burmese typewriters.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the journey this time was to see if computers had
finally dealt typewriters a fatal blow. Happily, the answer was no.
</P>
<P>
   Young people, women in particular for some reason, have shown
new interest in the old machines, Tytell said. ``Some gal graduated
from Barnard, and her family decided to make her a present of the
typewriter that her grandma used, with Champagne and everything,''
he said. ``Something's going on there.''
</P>
<P>
   As he talked, a young man from Brooklyn carried in a slightly
battered Mercedes Selecta, an antique manual typewriter that he had
bought at a yard sale as a gift for his girlfriend, an aspiring
author. ``She wants to write with the same tools Hemingway wrote
with,'' the Brooklyn man explained.
</P>
<P>
   Some writers _ no names mentioned _ come to the shop when words
fail them, having convinced themselves that the fault lies not in
the stars but in the typewriter. ``They tell me that the machine is
not responding properly, even when it is in perfect shape,'' Tytell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Who is to say they are wrong? Certainly not Tytell, who believes
that typewriters have a soul, unlike you know what.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any question which kind of machine is healthier for
you? In the typewriter's heyday, you never heard about mass
outbreaks of repetitive stress injury, or about eyestrain from
staring too long at blinking images.
</P>
<P>
   Typewriters also fostered mental health. Nothing relieved a
struggling writer's frustration like ripping the paper out of the
roll and crumpling it. Think of all the computer weirdos you read
about these days, like the cybercultists who committed mass suicide
last year. You never had anything like that with the Smith-Corona
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   As for durability, don't waste breath making comparisons. ``You
show me the computer that's going to last 15 years,'' Tytell said.
``But with these'' _ his hand swept across a row of old Olympias _
``you wipe them off and they're good for another 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   And he expects to be around to nurse them, if not for decades
then certainly beyond the irrelevant Y2K.

NUANCE ON THE NET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LINDA MATCHAN   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jonathan Zittrain, executive director of the Berkman Center for
Internet and Society at Harvard Law School, maintains computer
communication is most effective when ``it's between two people with
a strong nuanced e-mail relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   But how do you convey nuance on a computer screen? Below, some
tips proffered by experienced e-mailers:
</P>
<P>
   --To convey anger: Use bold face or upper case lettering, or
lots of exclamation points. Being parsimonious with words can help.
</P>
<P>
   --To convey affection. Use X's and O's, or pet names, or
romantic text art, like flowers. You can utilize smiley faces,
though they are considered by some to be out of vogue. Beyond that,
``people are free to write haikus or whatever,'' offers Zittrain.
</P>
<P>
   --To flirt: Cute nicknames are useful. Concentrate on your
saluations (openings and closings): try matching the style of your
sign-off to that of your partner's greeting, or better yet,
one-upping it. ``If go one step and it's not reciprocated, consider
it a rebuff,'' says New York scientist Zachary Mainen, who has had
a long-term, long-distance e-mail relationship.
</P>
<P>
   --To pine away: Difficult to do via e-mail, ``other than various
versions of ``I miss you a lot,'' says Mainen.
</P>
<P>
   --To show surprise: Gasp! ...............thud.
</P>
<P>
   --To send high-tech greetings: Most mail programs, like the ones
incorporated into web browsers, will let you send graphics, voice
and even video clips in e-mail. A traditionalist could write a love
letter in his or her own hand-writing, then scan it into his
machine and send the resulting graphic as e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   E-lovers with a microphone and a sound card can mail each
other's spoken messages or mood music. Those with digital cameras
or video can send up-to-the-minute still pictures or movies.

MARRIED, WITH E-MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LINDA MATCHAN   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Zachary Mainen, a New York neuroscientist, was trying to sustain
a long-distance relationship with a woman who lived in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   When her birthday rolled around, he did what any modern-day
lover on a limited budget would do. He sent her a bouquet of e-mail
roses, constructed of computer screen letters and numbers. ``I
suppose if you look at it on the negative side, you can say it's
just cheap,'' says Mainen.
</P>
<P>
   But if you look at it on the positive side, you can say it's
just an adaptive solution to a contemporary domestic dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   At a time in American economic life when job demands have forced
numerous couples to live in different places, at least some of the
time, the definition of what it means to be in each other's company
is being radically stretched. Many couples are turning to e-mail
communication as a way to keep the passions going, the domestic
front stable, the news exchanged, and the phone bills down.
</P>
<P>
   Call these text-based relationships e-love. Or, in many cases,
e-marriage.
</P>
<P>
   And while e-mail has its limitations _ it's slower than a phone
call, it lacks inflection, it's easily misconstrued, it drives
employers nuts _ for many, many geographically separated couples,
it is ``like smoking the crack pipe of relationships,'' says Andrew
McLaughlin, a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society
at Harvard Law School.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need that daily fix of words. You can't stop. It is the
fuel that keeps relationships going.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
From: Peter Huff-Rousselle &QL; 
To: Maggie Huff-Rousselle &QL; 
Subject: Still hoping to hear your voice sometime!
</P>
<P>
   Hi, Lover!
</P>
<P>
   The problem you had with WORD sounds like a similar weird thing
that happened to me ... Send me the file as an attachment and let
me check it out for you.
</P>
<P>
   Do you still love me? I tried to imagine you falling for someone
else while I was gone for so long, but I couldn't. ... You're
always on my mind ...
</P>
<P>
   That's one-half of a typical e-mail exchange between Peter and
Maggie Huff-Rousselle, formerly of Brookline, Mass. and now of No
Fixed Address. Maggie, 50, a health care management consultant for
several Third World countries, is working on a project in Phnom
Penh, Cambodia. Peter, 54, a retired health care administrator,
stayed behind in the Caribbean island of St. Lucia, site of
Maggie's last project, to prepare the couple's boat for a
transatlantic sailing trip.
</P>
<P>
   Exchanging megabytes of e-mail ``has made all the difference in
the world,'' says Peter, during a telephone interview from Quebec,
where the two recently vacationed. ``Without e-mail I can't imagine
what I would have done. I would have gone crazy feeling completely
disconnected from Maggie.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple has plenty of cybercompany, such as Doug McCasland
and Virginia Reuter, recently married. He does computer work at
Fidelity Investments in Boston, she has a job in San Francisco.
``We e-mail each other every day, sometimes several times a day,''
says Reuter,via e-mail. ``This is similar to our e-mail output when
we are living together, so it gives me the illusion that he's not
really so far away.''
</P>
<P>
   Or _ at the extreme end of things _ _ Bjorn Johns, a Colorado
engineer who spends two months a year surveying in the Antarctic.
While he's away, e-mail is his only viable way of staying in
contact with the woman he lives with in Boulder: He can telephone
out of the Antarctic but can't get incoming calls, and there's an
inconvenient 18-hour time difference between them. ``E-mail,'' he
says, ``is your main link to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way to know the number of commuting couples in the
country _ the Bureau of Labor Statistics does not track these
numbers _ let alone how many of them e-mail each other. But the
number is surely not small. In 1987, Washington psychologist Karen
Shanor, author of ``How To Stay Together When You Have to Be
Apart,'' estimated there were 2 million commuter marriages in the
United States, , and the number has likely risen. But for many,
it's a critical lifeline _ efficient, cheaper than the telephone,
and convenient, especially for couples living in different time
zones. Some find that e-mail _ with its illusion of distance and
its absence of eye contact _ is an easier way to discuss sensitive
or difficult topics. ``The fact that you seem to not really be
saying it ... makes it feel safer,'' says Helen Palmer, the Boston
bureau chief for the NPR radio show ``Marketplace.'' She uses
e-mail as one way of keeping in touch with her husband, freelance
musician Joshua Rifkin, who travels a great deal.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, when used creatively, playfully, and flirtatiously, e-mail
offers the unexpected benefit of ``kind of spicing things up,''
observes psychologist Shanor.

   The other day I found an ad for Australian emeralds, that said:
``Nothing is so wicked as to love your wife as if she was your
mistress.''
</P>
<P>
   Love, Pra Poon (``wife'' in Khmer)
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, most e-mailing couples say their correspondencee
revolves largely around the mundane business of daily life _ what
the Huff-Rousselles refer to as ``domestic administrivia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good way to get another dose of family information and
news,'' says Curt Lorang, an engineer in St. Paul, Minn., who holds
down the family fort (including two children, aged 10 and 13)
during the week while his wife works in Fort Wayne, Ind., as an
executive for a division of IBM.

   ``It's more of a morale booster, in some respects,'' he says. He
paraphrases the typical one- or two-paragraph e-mail letter he
sends his wife: ```The weather here has been nice, Adam got two
hits last night and made a great play behind the plate. But they
lost.' Then, a few little tidbits about what's coming up for
tomorrow, and I'll tell her when a good time to call would be.'' He
gets the same kind of e-mail in return, since ``she's incredibly
busy,'' says Lorang. ```Got your note, hotter than hell here but
then again I haven't been out long enough. Thanks for the e-mail
and tell Adam better luck at the game next time.'''
</P>
<P>
   Couples say e-marriage correspondence tends to fall into one of
three general categories, representing a hierarchy of communication
needs. At the lowest level is domestic business. (As in: Have you
paid the mortgage, when are you coming home, have you fed the dog?)
At the next level is news exchange (itals)(``Tonight I am having 6
people over for dinner. Naturally, I have made spaghetti sauce, my
standard,''(unitals) as Maggie Huff-Rousselle wrote one day to her
husband.)
</P>
<P>
   At the deepest level is intimate, emotional e-mail communication
that, ideally, sustains the fabric of the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Palmer to husband Joshua Rifkin:
</P>
<P>
   Hi _ as you know I'm a klutz and incompetent when it comes to
technology _ but I really wanted to let you know that I'm thinking
of you as I sit at my desk. This office is frigid _ 65F _ though I
have the thermostat up to 85!
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Rifkin to Helen Palmer:
</P>
<P>
   One good greeting deserves another. It's now 5.13 in the morning
on Thursday. Monday, still on English time, I also woke up at about
this time. Have fun reading this in the privacy of your cold
office, which I hope these words can warm up a bit.
</P>
<P>
   But e-mail can be fraught with pitfalls, couples say. It is hard
to distinguish brevity from irritation. It's difficult, in e-mail,
to convey inflection.
</P>
<P>
   And without the reassurance of a daily presence, even
computer-aided separations can amplify insecurities and other
anxieties. (itals)``I hope you're not feeling so lonely that you'll
start a cyber affair,'' reads one Huff-Rousselle communication.
``You must have got my message about the frequent flyer miles, but
you didn't say anything back.''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   E-mail is ``cold in the way text is cold,'' says McLaughlin at
Harvard, who had a two-year e-mail relationship with a woman in
another city. ``It's no substitute for some of the other senses,
for being physically in the same place. A voice can convey passion
and emotion in a way that text just can't. There is an energy that
can be missing from e-mail, even if it's convincing in an
intellectual way.''
</P>
<P>
   This is why bicoastal couple Doug McCasland and Virginia Reuter
tend to sprinkle their e-mails with endearments _ ``as a sort of
replacement for an affectionate tone of voice,'' says Reuter.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin believes there is a richness and value to e-mail that
hasn't yet been been widely appreciated. He and his ex-girlfriend
kept a journal of their e-mail letters, which they eventually bound
into a volume ``as a record of our relationship. It was very
moving,'' he says. ``It traces everything from the giddiest early
stages to the demise of the relationship in gory detail, but
beautifully so.''
</P>
<P>
   E-mail, he believes, ``is qualitatively different from other
forms of communication _ better in some respects and shallower in
some,'' he says. ``It's no substitute for hearing the quiet voice
of the other person. But you can sit down and spend some time
writing out your thoughts carefully, and speak in a more considered
fashion. It is really quite powerful to receive a page of
beautifully expressed thoughts and reflections.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some believe that e-mail has the potential to be a
parallel mode of communication even for couples living in the same
city.
</P>
<P>
   One woman, an administrator at Tufts University, says she
frequently e-mails her husband during the working day to process
the minutiae of married life _ weekend plans, children's
appointments, and other details that they are too busy or tired to
deal with in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We depend on this. We get a lot of work done that way,'' said
the administrator, who asked not to use her name because she
e-mails from work. ``It's a tension for employees that you can be
audited and have all your messages thrown in your face.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see the power and uniqueness of e-mail,'' says Sherry
Turkle, who teaches the sociology of science at MIT and is the
author of ``Life On the Screen: Identity in the Age of the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it in people who live together and see each other often.
Sometimes they use it as a way to talk about something difficult to
raise. I've interviewed couples where they are literally in bed
next to each other, and one is sleeping and the other is writing an
e-mail to the spouse. ... It has the fantasy of instant
communication but with a little bit of distance.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of some commuting couples, of course, there can be
too much distance. Just ask Mainen, sender of that e-mail bouquet.
He got, by return e-mail, a message that hardly qualified as a
thank-you note: ``That was nice. I got some real ones from
Claudia.''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty soon she logged off, permanently.

UNIVERSITIES FINDING A SHARP RISE IN COMPUTER-AIDED CHEATING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By IAN ZACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKSBURG, Va. _ In a troubling reminder of technology's darker
side, Virginia Tech, the state's largest university, has
acknowledged that computer-aided cheating by students is growing
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot more cases,'' said Leon Geyer, who oversees
the student-run honor system at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and
State University, which has 25,000 students. ``In the olden days,
you had to copy from the book. Now, you just copy and paste.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the university say that the number of cheating
complaints has grown to 280 last year from 80 in 1995-96. Those
complaints include reports of plagiarizing information from the
Internet, sharing answers or other information by e-mail or
diskette and stealing information from a fellow student's computer
screen or electronic mail system.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech is not the only university experiencing growth in
such incidents or worrying about how to detect and prevent them.
The personal computer, while enhancing teaching, has made cheating
as simple as pointing and clicking a mouse or exchanging a floppy
disk with the answers to a take-home test.
</P>
<P>
   Stealing or copying someone's work has become so effortless,
some say, that students may be inured to the ethical or legal
consequences, much like drivers exceeding the speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say everyone in the class has a networked computer,''
said Chris Duckenfield, vice provost for computing and information
technology at Clemson University in South Carolina. ``They can
exchange information electronically. They can pull down information
electronically. Who's going to watch over every student's shoulder
to see what they're doing?''
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Boston University was so concerned about computer
cheating that it filed a federal lawsuit to stop eight companies
from selling term papers over the Internet in Massachusetts. The
university's action came a quarter century after the institution
successfully sued term-paper mills hawking typewritten papers out
of Volkswagen buses in Cambridge. The state now bans the sale of
printed term papers.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of California at Berkeley, a computer science
professor, Alex Aiken, created software to identify plagiarism in
his programming courses. He placed the software, called Moss, for
Measure of Software Similarity, on the Internet (at
www.cs.berkeley.edu/aiken/moss.html) and it is now used by more
than 500 professors at universities worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Aiken attributes the rise to the anonymity of electronic
communication, the vast resources of the Internet and the
ever-multiplying speed of computers. ``The fact that you can do it
more quickly makes it easier to yield to an impulse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This is apparently what happened to the president of the student
union at Oxford University in England, who was expelled after the
university determined she had cheated on a final examination by
downloading an essay she had written earlier.
</P>
<P>
   At Virginia Tech last spring, dozens of students in a
computer-programming course _ roughly 10 percent of a class of 600
_ were accused of electronically sharing information on a year-end
assignment. And recently, two graduating seniors downloaded another
students' work to turn in as their own computer programming
assignment. A piece of software similar to Aiken's found them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does seem to be an increasing problem because it is so much
easier,'' said Amanda Rich, a 21-year-old Virginia Tech senior from
Clinton, Ill., who is chief justice of the university's honor
system court, where accused cheaters are tried.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rich said some incidents were obvious cases of wrongdoing,
while others appear to be ignorance by students who do not
understand the rules of scholarly research.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons, professors and administrators at Virginia
Tech do not quite know how to respond. ``I don't know if this is
the beginning of an ugly, awful trend or just a blip,'' said John
Carroll, a computer science professor. ``It's a new world out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   But professors are not waiting around for a new set of computer
commandments to take hold. Some routinely search the Internet when
information in a term paper appears suspicious. A University of
Iowa professor has written an electronic paper called
``Downloadable Term Papers: What's a Prof. to Do?'' The professor,
Tom Rocklin, says that some teachers unwittingly encourage students
to cheat by giving broad general-knowledge assignments or
scheduling too many large projects at the end of a semester.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you tie assignments really tightly to what you're doing in
class, it becomes more difficult to cheat,'' Rocklin said. He also
suggested that teachers require outlines and rough drafts for term
papers, so they can see a student's work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Geyer, the faculty adviser for Virginia Tech's honor system,
said that while computer cheating was easy to do, once suspected it
was also ``easy to detect _ and students haven't figured out the
latter.''
</P>
<P>
   At Virginia Tech, students found guilty of computer-aided
cheating have received punishments ranging from zeros and
double-weighted zeros on tests _ which can mean a failing grade in
a course _ to community service. Under the university's honor
system, students rarely are expelled for a first offense.
</P>
<P>
   But, Geyer said, ``I know some graduating seniors who had to go
to summer school.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's starting to get laughable. It seems like every other week
or so, we get some blockbuster revelation that is guaranteed to put
the president of the United States out of business.
</P>
<P>
   And every other week or so, the American people react the same
way: They stifle a yawn, take the new revelation in stride and tell
their friendly neighborhood public-opinion pollster that they think
Bill Clinton is doing a good job as president.
</P>
<P>
   So it was on Monday, as the overhyped videotape of Clinton's
Aug. 17 grand jury testimony was released to the media and hurled
unedited across the airwaves in response to the public's supposed
hunger for ever-increasing helpings of information about the White
House sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The operative phrase here is ``supposed hunger,'' since the
public's yearning for scandal news is in fact ever-waning, not
ever-increasing. Polls show that most Americans would prefer to
know less, not more, about Clinton's involvement with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky and the alleged lawbreaking it
inspired.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the portion of the electorate that just plain
despises Clinton and will never be at peace until he is driven from
office, the American people would like nothing better than to see
this whole deal simply go away. No more Monica. No more Ken Starr.
No more embarrassing details about the president's sexual
proclivities.
</P>
<P>
   Let's take a moment, as one of those quirky lawyers on ``Ally
McBeal'' likes to say.
</P>
<P>
   I have no use for Bill Clinton. I pleaded with voters to elect
Bob Dole in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But having no use for Clinton doesn't require me to embrace this
farcical pursuit of him by people who are so out of touch with
actual Americans that they seem to have lost their grip on reality.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment that the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal burst into the
headlines and exploded onto the airwaves, the media and the
anti-Clinton politicians have been predicting the imminent demise
of the Clinton presidency.
</P>
<P>
   It was way back in January that we first heard the pronouncement
that Clinton's presidency could be measured in ``days, not weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Or was it hours, not days?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. Independent counsel Starr somehow convinced the media
and Clinton's opponents that he had an open-and-shut case against
Clinton, that he had the president dead to rights not only for
violating his marriage vows but also on actual criminal charges of
perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the case wasn't quite as open and shut as some
believed. Here we are, eight months later, and Clinton is still in
office. Not only that, he's still racking up job approval ratings
in excess of 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to the grand jury videotape _ which was
billed by Clinton's detractors as the straw that would finally
break the president's back, as the stomach-churning spectacle that
would finally cause the public to decide that Clinton must go.
</P>
<P>
   And what happened? After the tape was aired in its tedious
entirety on CNN and other news outlets, Clinton's job approval
rating went up six points.
</P>
<P>
   Before the videotape, Starr's report to Congress was touted as
the final outrage that would bring Clinton down. Before that, it
was his post-testimony speech. Before that, it was Lewinsky's
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the media have too much invested in this
story; they can't let it go. And Clinton's political enemies are so
blinded by their contempt for him that they can't see that the
public has no interest in dumping him over a sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment is a political process that requires the support of
the people. Absent overwhelming public demand for driving this or
any president out of office, Congress shouldn't even be talking
about impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Resignation? Clinton will never, ever quit. Perseverance is the
only principle he understands.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress has the audacity to impeach a president who has a 66
percent approval rating, well, let's get on with it. If not, let's
change the subject.

WHAT DO THESE `SENIOR WHITE HOUSE ADVISERS' DO? 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ By now, everything that can be said about the Lewinsky
scandal probably has been said, but remarkably little mention has
been made of its introduction of a comparatively new term into the
political lexicon _ and one that doesn't even have a sexual
connotation.
</P>
<P>
   It is the title: senior White House adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, presidential consultants and confidantes have been
around for a long while. However, President Clinton's entanglement
_ if that's the appropriate word _ with onetime White House intern
Monica Lewinsky has been the brought the term ``senior White House
adviser'' to the fore as never in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Few television discussions of the issue have lacked participants
described as past or current White House advisers. The qualifying
attribution is always ``senior.'' If there is such a thing as a
junior adviser, he or she never gets on the air.
</P>
<P>
   But I've been unable to discover what most of these senior
advisers do their advising about or, for that matter, to whom they
give their pearls of wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, one is described in those ubiquitous sub-titles
that tv editors love as a White House counsel, normally suggesting
involvement with legal questions. Otherwise, hovever, no hint is
offered about what the person we are seeing on the screen _ someone
that few of us have ever before heard of _ actually does. For all
we know, he or she is someone who has simply been found roaming
around the Beltway in a government vehicle at the fortuitous
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier presidents like Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman had
aides who were modestly known as presidential assistants and had
specific tasks like filtering requests for meetings with the
president. One or two, such as Clark Clifford, originally Truman's
naval aide, acquired informal influence. But the only figure who
genuinely had the chief executive's ear was Roosevelt's confidante,
Harry Hopkins, who lived in the White House without a job
description.
</P>
<P>
   In still earlier days, presidents dispensed with outside advice
altogether. Lincoln's innermost thoughts were his sole counselor.
The same was true of Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Eisenhower's creation of the post of White House chief of
staff changed things forever. The possibility was launched, as in
the military, for all sorts of extraneous jobs, many of them
unneeded.
</P>
<P>
   An ``adviser'' could now go to the chief of staff to suggest
something like the president changing his hair style or wearing a
different tie.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing discussion probably goes something like this:
</P>
<P>
   CofS: ``Wait a minute, Mort, designating the president's tie is
the responsibility of a senior White House adviser. You're only a
junior adviser. You will have to wait for a promotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Adviser: ``But...''
</P>
<P>
   CofS: ``But nothing. Now, if you can get youself on one of those
TV panel shows designated as a senior adviser, I'll see what I can
do for you about getting the president another tie.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN PEDRO, Calif. _ First you must start your guests eating from
the moment they enter the house. Force feed them, actually. It is
not polite for guests to show any sign of hunger _ and very gauche
of the hostess to believe that they could possibly be sated.
</P>
<P>
   While they munch on humus and pita bread, immediately serve
Turkish coffee and customize each tiny cup to the sweet tooth of
the guest. Bitter, sweet and syrupy are the choices, but don't
worry if you make a faux pas. The Lebanese guest, while expecting a
feast, will express guilt over putting you out. It is the custom.
</P>
<P>
   Apologize for everything. Thank them for visiting your humble
home. Confess that you only spent a week planning for their
gracious visit. Never sit down before dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The main meal must consist of beef and poultry. Pile the chicken
on a huge plate and garnish it haphazardly with lots and lots of
parsley.
</P>
<P>
   The beef could be sliced, ground or diced but it must be
referred to as ``kebab.'' That is so the guests can use the correct
terminology when they critique your menu amongst themselves. It is
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of conversation will change often. Do not remain on
one subject. You must constantly interrupt the ill-mannered guest
who insists on finishing his train of thought.
</P>
<P>
   Never curse the old country, unless the curse is made with a
sigh, and nudge your husband at random times to toast each and
every guest, twice if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner, gather the women in the kitchen. Assign a talker
to brew the coffee, a strong woman to scrub the pots and the female
guest with the lowest self-esteem to empty your dishwasher.
</P>
<P>
   The men, of course, will remain at the dining room table to
discuss manly stuff such as which political cur was really
responsible for the Lebanese civil war and what other cur, in their
opinion, is still fit to run the country.
</P>
<P>
   Send in the baklava and the fruit platter and do not be offended
when the guests begin to peel even the tiny grapes. They are just
being cautious.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Lebanese etiquette demands that the guests all
rise and head to the front door. Quickly assemble their coats and
purses and simultaneously beg them to stay, beseech them to forgive
the inadequate spread and, just so the neighbors will hear, utter a
couple of ``long live America''s.
</P>
<P>
   Now you can sit and eat what remains of your dinner.

NEVER TOO MUCH GARLIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Rule No. 1 regarding garlic: There's no such
thing as too much garlic.
</P>
<P>
   Rule No. 2: There's no right or wrong way to cook with garlic,
either, provided you don't burn one of the world's oldest
cultivated plants.
</P>
<P>
   Back to Rule No. 1. Pat Reppert, whose book ``Mad for Garlic''
was released last year, estimates she goes through as much as two
dozen heads of garlic a week.
</P>
<P>
   Considering there are between eight and 12 cloves on a typical
head, Reppert's generous use of garlic proves there's no such thing
as too much. Keep in mind, she cooks for only three adults,
including herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some nights I'll use 24 or more cloves, it just depends on
what I'm making. Let's see, today's Wednesday and I have 15 heads
in a hanging basket in my kitchen,'' Reppert said last week. ``I'm
sure it will all be used up this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Some nights Reppert will use garlic in every dish she puts on
the table. She begins by taking one or two fresh cloves and rubbing
the inside of the wooden salad bowl, a tradition in many French and
Italian households. The cloves are then discarded, ready to imbue
the greens and tomatoes with a mild, nutty fragrance.
</P>
<P>
   She continues with stir-fried green beans, with minced garlic in
the oil. For the entree, she chooses between any number of baked
chicken dishes that rely on garlic as a primary flavor agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am continuously experimenting with garlic,'' added Reppert,
who is credited with starting the annual Hudson Valley Garlic
Festival, scheduled this weekend at Cantine Field in Saugerties,
N.Y. ``Since I started experimenting with different recipes I've
found how good it is to use in large amounts.''
</P>
<P>
   Which leads us to Rule No. 2. The reason why there's no right or
wrong way to use garlic is that the almond-sized cloves taste
dramatically different, depending more on how they are prepared
than how many are used. Toasted or roasted, sauteed or fried,
minced or pureed, or, as some prefer, raw, garlic is as garlic is
treated.
</P>
<P>
   Raw garlic has a sharp, biting flavor, too strong for many who
nevertheless love how cooked garlic enhances anything from soup to
vegetables to meats. Cooking eliminates the bite and softens the
flavor, while roasting garlic gives it a smooth, mild, nutty
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the world's best-known healing food is garlic, or
Allium sativumr nonpareil.
</P>
<P>
   Its health advantages are diverse because it aids the
circulation and resistance to infection, which in turn affect many
aspects of the body's health. Among its therapeutic properties,
medical experts agree garlic can: lower both blood pressure and
blood cholesterol levels and help diabetics by reducing the rise in
blood sugar in response to food.
</P>
<P>
   And you would be hard-pressed to find a food more universal than
garlic. Almost every culture uses garlic; only the amount of garlic
and the degree to which it is emphasized differ as you travel the
globe.
</P>
<P>
   The entire ancient world from Spain to China revered garlic.
During the time of the Pharaohs, when Egypt was at the peak of its
power, garlic was given to the laborers and slaves who were
building the historic pyramids in order to increase their stamina
and strength as well as to protect them from disease.

MEDICAL MARVEL OR POLICE HARASSMENT? 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Most freaks you can spot right away. They have
six heads, three eyes or some other physical characteristic that
sets them apart from the rest of humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of them, though. For example, Rachel McEneny looks
completely normal. She's a pretty blonde of 26 _ only one nose, no
beard.
</P>
<P>
   But Rachel McEneny is clearly a freak of nature. There's no
other way to explain how her body sheds alcohol at such a stunning
rate.
</P>
<P>
   The Albany police arrested Rachel McEneny last week and charged
her with drunken driving. That happened the same night her father,
New York Assemblyman Jack McEneny, handily fought back a primary
election challenge by Gary Domalewicz, the candidate the mayor of
Albany backed in that race. Mayor Jerry Jennings was eager to
punish Rachel McEneny's father for his unsuccessful but annoying
primary challenge against the mayor the year before.
</P>
<P>
   The cops charged that Rachel McEneny, who managed both her
father's campaigns, ran a stop sign at 2:17 a.m. while on the way
home from her father's victory party. They said that she failed a
sobriety test. So they slapped her in manacles and dragged her off
to the station. There, they gave her a Breathalyzer test that
recorded her blood alcohol content at .11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, though, after she was sprung, Rachel McEneny
had a blood test conducted at Albany Memorial Hospital. The results
of that test _ .04 percent blood alcohol content. Rachel McEneny's
lawyer submitted results of that test to Albany Police Court
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Gerstenzang, a lawyer not involved in this _ but an
acknowledged expert in cases of drunken driving _ told me that the
average human being sheds alcohol at the rate of .02 percent per
hour, tops. That makes Rachel McEneny a certifiable medical marvel,
since her body manages to shed alcohol at twice the normal human
rate.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, though, some other possibilities exist to explain all
this. One is that the hospital blood test was wrong. That is not a
possibility that anybody should bet on, however. Another is that
the Breathalyzer was screwed up. The only problem with that
explanation is that it was recalibrated only two days before Rachel
McEneny blew into it.
</P>
<P>
   Still another possibility is that Rachel McEneny was running a
temperature, which would register a higher blood alcohol content
reading on the Breathalyzer. Also, just before her Breathalyzer
test, she might have used some mouthwash. Why she would do that I
can't imagine, but I couldn't reach her Tuesday to clear up that
question.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is that Rachel McEneny belched just before
the test, which could throw off the machine. But the test was
conducted by an officer specifically trained to watch for that sort
of thing. After all, no police officer would ever want to see
anybody nailed for drunken driving _ not even the daughter of a
politician who has called for creation of a police review board _
if that person wasn't really driving drunk.
</P>
<P>
   So it seems that only one reasonable explanation could exist for
this bizarre turn of events in the Rachel McEneny drunken-driving
case. Jack McEneny has obviously fathered a fantastic genetic blip
so far removed from the normal range of human physical response
that she ought to be written up in the medical books in crimson
ink.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Rachel McEneny's lawyer, Steve Coffey, wants to see
his client written up in other literature. It's Coffey's fondest
wish, once this case is dismissed, that his client appear in court
reports as the recipient of the biggest false arrest damage award
in the history of humankind.
</P>
<P>
   For a lawyer, though, that kind of thinking is perfectly normal.
</P>

   HEART-ATTACKS-MED -- Although deaths from heart disease have

   Breast irregularities send the author, not yet 40, for her first
mammogram. In the waiting room she finds the peculiar intimacy and
comraderie of women facing the same fears. ``In a week, or a month,
we won't recognize each other on the street. But today, in this
place, there is a truth we both know: We are all in this
together,'' Rubenstein writes. (slugged:

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    I am sitting in a room with at least 18 other women, all of us
in standard-issue gowns. We are of varying ages, ethnicity, and
economic standing. We are in varying states of dismay, fear and
apprehension. We are here because of our breasts.
 &HT;    This is my first mammogram. Some irregularities noted while
nursing my baby have prompted my visit, making me, nearing 40, one
of the youngest women in the room. Soon, another woman who looks
about my age comes in and sits next to me, acknowledging me with
worried eyes _ only a problem would have brought us here before the
recommended time.
 &HT;    All of us here have our stories _ if not our body's own, than
that of a close friend, sister, mother, aunt, cousin, friend of
friend, mother of friend. Someone who has found a lump or been told
of a spot, and who has had to enter the world we all now fear to do
battle, endure, survive _ or not. Regardless of our ages or reasons
for being here, it is impossible not to be nervous.
 &HT;    We sit, for the most part, silently, thumbing distractedly
through magazines, watching the parade of womanhood pass in and out
of the various rooms. One group of older women has clearly come
together, strength in numbers. They have brought their knitting and
sit companionably around a table, chatting and counting stitches,
losing track as one or the other of them is brought in for an exam
or consultation.
 &HT;    As we take our turns at the machine (this will only hurt for a
second, dear, a bit of pressure is all) and come back to wait for
our results, we note who goes in before and after us _ each of us
tracking our potential for bad news by the order and flow of our
companions. As name after name is called, the woman next to me and
I exchange glances more frequently, certain at last that many who
were examined after us have been given leave to go.
 &HT;    ``This is how my mother found out,'' she confides, finally.
``Everyone else was coming and going, but they needed to take more
time with her.''
 &HT;    ``Maybe our charts are just in a pile that hasn't been picked up
yet,''I offer inanely, trying to stem the panic that is rising in
us both.
 &HT;    We are silent again, and I pull my robe closer around me,
feeling the protrusions that have brought me here. They have marked
other stages of my life _ their small size the bane of my
adolescence, their sudden growth the first sign of my pregnancy,
their ability to produce nourishment for my baby an endless wonder.
 &HT;    Finally, I am called in and receive good news _ the
irregularities are nothing more than that, unremarkable changes
that can occur with pregnancy and nursing. I come out with a smile
and am greeted with a thumbs-up from my acquaintance.
 &HT;    ``Walk right on out of here,'' she says. ``Don't stop.''
 &HT;    I start to follow her advice but find I cannot leave without
her. We have not even exchanged names, and, if her news is bad, she
may not want or find comfort in a stranger's presence. But still I
linger in the dressing room, making small adjustments, peeking into
the waiting room, until I see her being summoned. When she comes
out, her face is awash in relief _ her mother's fate not yet, if
ever, her own.
 &HT;    She is at first surprised to find me waiting for her, but then
we self-consciously laugh and grasp hands tightly in understanding.
In a week, or a month, we won't recognize each other on the street.
But today, in this place, there is a truth we both know: We are all
in this together.

   &UR; EDITORS: The New York Times Syndicate looks at bilingualism,
politics and celebrity in its Hispanic Heritage Month (Sept.
15-Oct. 15) package. Two articles examine how assimilation has
altered the attitude of many Hispanics toward their native language
and culture. An article from Hispanic magazine describes how the
GOP is cultivating the Hispanic vote after getting a shellacking in
the 1996 election. Finally, we offer a three-part excerpt from the
autobiography of TV superstar Christina Saralegui.

   More and more English is creeping into Spanish-language
television these day. It's a tacit acknowledgement that an
increasingly large percentage of the Hispanic population is heavily
assimilated and speaks English often and well. This trend is also
reflected, Zate notes, in magazines such as the bilingual Latina
and in advertising. (slugged:

   ``I now speak my native language with an accent,'' best-selling
novelist Julia Alvarez declares in this lyrical and touching essay
from her forthcoming book. After Alvarez emigrated from the
Dominican Republic in the 1960s, her English became fluent as her
Spanish become dormant, a reflection of the growing distance
between herself and her native culture. ``It wasn't until I failed
at first love, in Spanish, that I realized how unbridgeable that
gap had become,'' she writes. (slugged:

   In the 1996 presidential race, only 21 percent of the Latino
vote went to GOP candidate Bob Dole. With Hispanics and other
minorities making up an increasingly large percentage of the
electorate, the Republican Party is recognizing the need to win
over a constituency that associates the GOP with English-only,
anti-immigrant policies. One step in this effort is the formation
last year of the New Majority Council. (slugged:

 &UR; By CRISTINA SARALEGUI &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; From ``My Life as a Blonde,'' published by Warner Books &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She is the host of the most-watched TV program in the world _
Cristina Saralegui, the Cuban refugee who worked her way to the top
of the publishing world, then switched to television to create the
``El Show de Cristina,'' viewed daily by 100 million worldwide. Her
story, told in three 1,200-word parts, will inspire anyone to do
more with what they have. Born into wealth and ease, Cristina lost
it all when her family fled to Miami during Castro's revolution.
She defeated racism and poverty with an undaunted will to work and
to believe in her own dreams. Her mission in this book is to show
her readers how to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   In Part 1, Cristina tells of the family's flight to Miami and
how hardships in this country transformed her from a little rich
girl to a compassionate and supremely confidant businesswoman. In
Part 2, Cristina recounts the romance of meeting Marcos Avila of
Miami Sound Machine and of how they overcame her family's
resistance to her marrying a rock star 11 years her junior. In Part
3, Cristina describes her new life in TV, the grueling pace, the
seductions of fame and influence. (slugged:

 By MARIA ZATE  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    While channel surfing on a Sunday night, a familiar face pops up
on the TV screen. It's Giselle Fernandez, former anchor of ``NBC
Nightly News'' and currently anchor of the entertainment show
``Access Hollywood.''
 &HT;    She greets an enthusiastic crowd with the usual pleasantries,
and then slips the phrase ``muy caliente'' into her monologue. She
continues to speak in English and then drops another Spanish word.
She introduces her guest, actress Maria Conchita Alonso.
 &HT;    You check the channel. This isn't ``Access Hollywood.'' The show
is ``Cafe Ole with Giselle Fernandez'' and it's on Galavision, a
Spanish-language cable network.
 &HT;    But she's speaking English. Wait a minute, what's going on here?
 &HT;    Welcome to bilingual television. English-language format and
content are gaining a foothold in a market once occupied solely by
Spanish media. From TV programming to magazines and radio,
bilingual and English-language media continue to grow as a way to
reach the Hispanic market.
 &HT;    Consider recent news items: Emilio Estefan plans to produce a
Latin-themed, English-language TV program for Universal Television
Group.
 &HT;    Latina magazine, a national bilingual women's magazine backed by
the publishers of Essence, switches from quarterly to monthly
distribution.
 &HT;    The Los Angeles Times announces plans to capture more Hispanic
readers, perhaps through a special Hispanic section in English.
 &HT;    In radio, several stations in the top 10 media markets use a
bilingual format with ratings success.
 &HT;    Why this growth in English and bilingual media?
 &HT;    ``It's the next logical step of the evolution of the Latino
population in the U.S.,'' says Alex Nogales, president of the
National Hispanic Media Coalition in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    As immigration laws tighten, and as the second- and
third-generation population increases, marketers and programmers
will focus on capturing the attention of the assimilated and
acculturated Hispanics, he explains.
 &HT;    In fact, the impetus behind Galavision's decision to air
bilingual programming lies in the success of another show that
celebrates assimilation and acculturation. Last year Galavision
began running a weekly half-hour bilingual show called ``Que Pasa
U.S.A.,'' a situation comedy that first aired on PBS in Miami back
in the '70s. The show represents a microcosm of what's happening in
the Hispanic media landscape.
 &HT;    ``Que Pasa U.S.A.'' features a Cuban family, with members from
three generations living under one roof.
 &HT;    ``It's about their experience in trying to retain their culture
and also to assimilate,'' says Michelle Bella, director of
marketing and communications for New York-based Galavision, the
cable network of Univision Communications Inc. in Miami. Galavision
reports that it reaches 7.5 million homes in the United States.
 &HT;    When Galavision first started airing ``Que Pasa U.S.A.,'' the
Nielsen ratings showed that it connected with viewers. This alerted
network executives to try more bilingual programming.
 &HT;    ``Until now, the English-dominant and bilingual crowd has
largely been ignored on TV,'' says producer Jeff Valdez, who along
with partner Bruce Barshop co-manage Si TV, the company that
produces ``Cafe Ole.'' Based in Culver City, Calif., Si TV produces
English-dominant and bilingual programming with Latino appeal.
 &HT;    According to the latest census information on language use at
home, assimilated Hispanics represent about 54 percent of the
Hispanic market. Data from 1990 show that 46 percent of Hispanics
speak Spanish and also speak English ``very well.'' Another 8
percent speak no Spanish. There are 26 percent who speak
predominantly Spanish and don't speak English well or not at all.
The remaining 20 percent say they speak both Spanish and English
``well.''
 &HT;    ``So far, (Hispanic) programming has pulled only from the
Spanish-dominant side,'' Valdez says. The new Galavision fare
creates ``a more competitive programming environment,'' he
believes.
 &HT;    But programming goes beyond language, emphasizes Barshop at Si
TV.
 &HT;    ``It's not just about language. It's also about programming
produced in the U.S.,'' he says. ``Most Spanish-language programs
come from South America and Mexico. Si TV is about recognizing the
cultural difference.''
 &HT;    Coverage of Hispanic culture in English has proven successful
for publishers, as exemplified by the bilingual women's magazine
Latina in New York. Latina publisher Christy Haubegger says she
chose a bilingual format to reflect the assimilated Latina in the
United States. No other magazine addressed the market in this way,
she says.
 &HT;    ``As a second generation Mexican-American who is bilingual,
reading in Spanish is very difficult,'' she says. ``And the
magazines published in Latin America don't relate to my life here
in the U.S.''
 &HT;    Thousands of women appear to share Ms. Haubegger's perceptions.
Latina debuted in May 1996 as a quarterly and this year changed to
monthly distribution. The magazine reports an unaudited circulation
of 300,000. According to Ms. Haubegger, Latina has attracted
high-end advertisers that previously had never placed ads in
Hispanic media.
 &HT;    ``We are the only Hispanic advertising that Ralph Lauren has
ever done, and that the Gap and Tommy Hilfiger has ever done,'' she
says.
 &HT;    Latina illustrates the growing support among advertisers for
English-language Hispanic media. However, many Hispanic advertising
agencies feel threatened by the use of English in the Hispanic
market. But the agencies created this problem in the first place,
says Nogales at the National Hispanic Media Coalition.
 &HT;    ``For years these agencies have been telling advertisers that
they will deliver the Latino market. And they've been telling
clients the only way to do it is to reach them in Spanish,'' he
says. ``They decided to put everything into the Spanish-speaking
game and now they're reaping what they sowed. These agencies are
going the way of the dinosaurs.''
 &HT;    The advertiser's message, including its language, must fit the
target audience.
 &HT;    Levi's, the San Francisco-based clothing manufacturer, launched
its first bilingual ads this summer for its jeans. Created by
Bromley, Aguilar &AMP; Associates in San Antonio, the ads, which ran on
Univision and Telemundo in Los Angeles and Houston, feature young
Hispanics who speak mostly Spanish with some English.
 &HT;    Michelle Vasquez, marketing manager at Levi's, says research
showed bilingual ads were the best way to reach the product's
target market _ young males ages 15 to 25.
 &HT;    ``We looked at the census data and found that 74 percent of this
group are bilingual,'' she says.
 &HT;    Despite an increase in English media that targets Hispanics,
Spanish-language advertising will continue to keep growing, says
Alejandro Ruelas, director of ethnic marketing at Anheuser-Busch in
St. Louis.
 &HT;    ``I think the political climate and the anti-Hispanic
initiatives out there will instill more pride in our people and
ultimately bring us back to our language,'' he says. ``There's the
growth of retro acculturation where a lot of Hispanics are making
an active effort to learn Spanish and consume Spanish-language
media. The Spanish language is here for the long haul and it will
continue to grow by leaps and bounds.''
 &HT;    So far, broadcast heavyweights Univision and Telemundo don't
perceive a threat on the language front. In fact, Univision
recently asked McDonald's to re-edit its latest TV commercial
``English Lessons'' for the air. The spot contained too much
English dialogue.
 &HT;    Univision accepts only all-Spanish advertising, says a company
spokeswoman in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    ``Our success comes from ads and programs being 100 percent
Spanish. Our viewers keep coming back because they are most
comfortable with that programming,'' she says.
 &HT;    At least one man is confident that Hispanics welcome culturally
relevant English media.
 &HT;    ``I've been getting (negative) comments about the viability of
targeting this market since the beginning,'' says Valdez at Si TV.
 &HT;    ``I say to those people, `Laugh all you want to now, but the
times, they are a-changing.'''

 By JULIA ALVAREZ  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 Excerpted from ``Something to Declare,'' published by Algonquin
Books  
 &HT;    The inevitable, of course, has happened. I now speak my native
language ``with an accent.'' What I mean by this is that I speak
perfect childhood Spanish, but if I stray into a heated discussion
or complex explanation, I have to ask, ``Por favor, puedo decirlo
en ingles?'' Can I please say it in English?
 &HT;    How and why did this happen?
 &HT;    When we emigrated to the United States from the Dominican
Republic in the early 1960s, the climate was not favorable for
retaining our Spanish. I remember one scene in a grocery store soon
after we arrived. An elderly shopper, overhearing my mother
speaking Spanish to her daughters, muttered that if we wanted to be
in this country, we should learn the language.
 &HT;    ``I do know the language,'' my mother said in her
boarding-school English, putting the woman in her place. She knew
the value of speaking perfect English. She had studied for several
years at Abbot Academy, flying up from the island to New York City,
and then taking the train to Boston.
 &HT;    At school, there were several incidents of name-calling and
stone-throwing, which our teachers claimed would stop if my sisters
and I joined in with the other kids and quit congregating together
at recess and jabbering away in Spanish. Those were the days before
bilingual education or multicultural studies _ when kids like us
were thrown in the deep end of the public school pool and left to
fend for ourselves. Not everyone came up for air.
 &HT;    Mami managed to get us scholarships to her old boarding school
where good manners and tolerance and English skills were required.
We were also all required to study a foreign language, but my
teachers talked me into taking French. In fact, they felt my
studying Spanish was equivalent to my taking a ``gut course.''
Spanish was my native tongue, after all, a language I already had
in the bag and would always be able to speak whenever I wanted.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, with Saturday drills and daily writing assignments,
our English skills soon met school requirements. By the time my
sisters and I came home for vacations, we were rolling our eyes in
exasperation at our old-world Mami and Papi, using expressions like
``far out,'' and ``what a riot!'' and ``outta sight'' and ``believe
you me'' as if we had been born to them.
 &HT;    As rebellious adolescents, we soon figured out that conducting
our filial business in English gave us an edge over our strict,
Spanish-speaking parents. We could spin circles around my mother's
``absolutamente no'' by pointing out the flaws in her arguments, in
English.
 &HT;    My father was a pushover for pithy quotes from Shakespeare, and
a recitation of ``the quality of mercy is not strained'' could
usually get me what I wanted.
 &HT;    Usually. There were areas we couldn't touch even with a
Shakespearean 10-foot pole _ the area of boys and permission to go
places where there might be boys, American boys, with their mouths
full of bubblegum and their minds full of the devil.
 &HT;    Our growing distance from Spanish was a way in which we were
setting ourselves free from that old world where, as girls, we
didn't have much say about what we could do with our lives. In
English, we didn't have to use the formal ``usted'' that
immediately put us in our place with our elders. We were
responsible for ourselves and that made us feel grown-up.
 &HT;    We couldn't just skirt culpability by using the reflexive: The
bag of cookies did not finish itself, nor did the money disappear
itself from Mami's purse. We had no one to bail us out of American
trouble once we went our own way in English. No family connections,
no tio (uncle) whose name might open doors for us.
 &HT;    If the world was suddenly less friendly, it was also more
exciting. We found out we could do things we had never done before.
We could go places in English we never could in Spanish, if we put
our minds to it. And my sisters and I put our combined four minds
to it, believe you me.
 &HT;    My parents, anxious that we not lose our tie to our native land,
and no doubt thinking of future husbands for their four daughters,
began sending us ``home'' to the Dominican Republic every summer to
Mami's family in the capital.
 &HT;    And just as we had once huddled in the school playground,
speaking Spanish for the comfort of it, my sisters and I now hung
out together in ``the D.R.,'' as we referred to it, kibitzing in
English on the crazy world around us, the silly rules for girls,
the obnoxious behavior of macho guys, the deplorable situation of
the poor.
 &HT;    My aunts and uncles tried unsuccessfully to stem this tide of
our Americanization, whose main expression was, of course, our use
of the English language.
 &HT;    ``Tienen que hablar en espanol,'' they commanded. ``Ay, come
on,'' we would say as if we had been asked to go back to baby talk
as grown-ups.
 &HT;    By now, we couldn't go back as easily as that. Our Spanish was
full of English. Countless times during a conversation, we were
corrected, until what we had to say was lost in our saying it
wrong. More and more we chose to answer in English even when the
question was posed in Spanish.
 &HT;    It was a measure of the growing distance between ourselves and
our native culture _ a distance we all felt we could easily retrace
with just a little practice. It wasn't until I failed at first
love, in Spanish, that I realized how unbridgeable that gap had
become.
 &HT;    He was a honey-skinned young man with wonderful dimples and a
pot belly that made him look like a Dominican version of the
Pillsbury doughboy. His name was Manuel Gustavo, but I
affectionately nicknamed him Mangu, after a mashed plantain dish
that is a staple of Dominican diet.
 &HT;    A few days after meeting him, Mangu's mother sent over an
elaborate dessert with lots of white frosting that looked
suggestively like a wedding cake.
 &HT;    When I tried to talk to Mangu about something of substance, the
conversation foundered. I couldn't carry on in Spanish about
complicated subjects, and Mangu didn't know a word of English. Our
silences troubled me. Maybe, my aunts were right. Too much
education in English could spoil a girl's chances in Spanish.
 &HT;    Evenings, Mangu would come over, and we'd sit on the patio and
try to make conversation or drive out to the country club in his
father's car to dance merengue and see what everyone else was
doing. What we were doing was looking for people to fill up our
silence with their talk.
 &HT;    I never had a Spanish-only boyfriend again. Maybe the
opportunity never presented itself, or maybe it was that as English
became my dominant tongue, too many parts of me were left out in
Spanish for me to be able to be intimate with a potential life
partner in only that language.
 &HT;    Still, the yearning remained. How wonderful to love someone
whose skin was the same honey-dipped, sallow-based color, who said
``concho'' when he was mad and ``cielito lindo'' when he wanted to
butter you up!
 &HT;    ``Ay, to make love in Spanish ...'' the Latina narrator of
Sandra Cisneros' story ``Bien Pretty'' exclaims. ``To have a lover
... whisper things in that language crooned to babies, that
language murmured by grandmothers, those words that smelled like
your house.''
 &HT;    But I wonder if after the Latina protagonist makes love with her
novio, she doesn't sit up in bed and tell him the story of her life
in English with a few palabritas thrown in to capture the rhythm of
her Latin heartbeat?

 c.1998 Hispanic magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   On Sept. 16, 1997, a group of Republicans met in a conference
room at the Marriott Hotel in downtown Washington, D.C., to launch
the party's latest program to enlist minorities. The meeting ended
on an upbeat note, but it had started with a lot of soul-searching
and apologies.
</P>
<P>
   The sense was that Republicans were running out of chances with
Latino voters. This time they vowed they would get it right.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the hosts _ Republican National Committee chair Jim
Nicholson and co-chair Patricia Harrison _ the attendees included
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Sen. Ben Knighthorse Campbell
(R-Colo.), Rep. Henry Bonilla (R-Texas), Rep. J. C. Watts (R-Okla.)
and some prominent minority Republicans who had been enlisted to
lead the new charge.
</P>
<P>
   It had been almost a year since the Republicans had received one
of their worst thrashings from the Democrats in the presidential
elections. The Latino vote had flexed its muscle in almost total
repudiation of the Republican presidential candidate and platform.
</P>
<P>
   Months later some Latino communities still rankled with
anti-Republican sentiment. Warning signs flashed all over the
Republican domain.
</P>
<P>
   An unsolicited report prepared by Republican pollster Frank Lunt
stated, ``Our majority is at stake. Republicans barely maintained
their congressional majority in 1996, and a major reason their
support dropped from 1994 was the utter collapse of the Hispanic
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded, ``The Hispanic vote is up for grabs, and
it is up to individual Republican candidates to say in plain
English and prove by their actions that they deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Party strategist Stu Spencer, in a memo to California GOP
leaders, warned that they would be committing ``political suicide''
if they continued to alienate Hispanics instead of courting what
many party philosophers contend are natural allies.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Hispanic disenchantment, Spencer added, ``The trend is
obvious, and the political danger is real. We are dramatically
losing market share of the fastest growing segment of the
electorate.''
</P>
<P>
   The RNC is concerned about its political standing with Hispanics
but not necessarily impressed with the Luntz and Spencer
appraisals, which an RNC spokesperson considered exaggerated and
overly alarmist.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, if such ominous warnings sound like Chicken Little
to some, the party leaders now seem to accept that the sky could
fall on them if they don't move more decisively and intelligently
to rebuild their minority constituency, particularly Hispanics, to
the heights of the Nixon and Reagan years.
</P>
<P>
   Banking on a new vehicle to attract minorities to the party, the
GOP unveiled the New Majority Council at the September meeting. It
sounds and looks a bit like Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition,
encompassing Hispanics, African Americans, Asian Americans and
Native Americans in a collegial effort with the emphasis on the
word ``majority,'' which the Republicans say foretells the future
status of the ethnic electorate.
</P>
<P>
   On the Hispanic side, statistics tell it better. Today's U.S.
population is 72.5 percent non-Hispanic white and 27.5 percent
minority, with Hispanics making up 11 percent. According to the
U.S. Census, within 50 years the adult population will transform
into 52.8 percent non-Hispanic white and 47.2 percent minority,
with Hispanics making up 24.5 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   RNC co-chair Harrison says, ``We have to stop minority thinking
because we are now talking about a new majority. It's up to us to
move toward people we want at the table and not up to the people to
find the table.''
</P>
<P>
   She credits the late Lee Atwater, the former RNC chairman and
premier political swami, as the originator of this idea. Atwater
was developing what he called the ``big tent'' for the Republicans
at the time of his death, and Harrison says she is just building on
this concept.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the NMC will achieve its goal is another matter. The
council's message of ``heritage, hope and opportunity'' is not
exactly revolutionary, and it relies on the GOP's basic planks of
family values, quality education, crimefighting, entrepreneurship
and less government.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bonilla, who is emerging as the Republicans' Latino star,
says Latinos, by virtue of their culture and values, are ready-made
Republicans, but the party has been slow to mine this bountiful
lode of voters. He credits his own success to dogged community
outreach.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla is a three-term Republican congressman from an area long
known as a Democratic power base. He was the first Latino
Republican congressman elected from Texas, and he has won each
contest with 60 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla attributes his success to delivering the right message _
the Republican message, not a specially crafted Hispanic one _
personally to his constituents and listening to their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to show up at these communities as I do,'' he says.
``I try to get this across to our people, but it's the hardest
thing to make them understand that it's not hard to do and that we
don't have to change our message or our values.''
</P>
<P>
   To start making inroads with Hispanics, the GOP must overcome a
notoriously bad reputation of late for antagonizing Hispanics. The
Republicans are also known for constantly shooting themselves in
the foot on Latino sensitivities.
</P>
<P>
   The Pete Wilsons and Bob Dornans of the party don't help.
Neither do the issues of immigration, affirmative action and
English-only, all attributed to Republican politics.
</P>
<P>
   In the last presidential campaign, the Republican candidate, Bob
Dole, practically ignored the Hispanic constituency. Latinos
responded in kind by helping Clinton clobber him, delivering 72
percent of the Latino vote to the president. Hispanics nationwide
voted 21 percent for Dole, the lowest support among Hispanics for
any presidential candidate in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic congressional candidates also got 72 percent of the
Hispanic vote.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans contend that the Dole shellacking was an aberration.
They insist that better measures of Republican-Latino affinity are
Richard Nixon, the first candidate to seriously court the Latino
vote, and the Great Communicator, Ronald Reagan, still a hero to
many Latinos. Both won the Hispanic vote by large margins,
generating the largest Latino turnouts in a presidential election
up to now.
</P>
<P>
   Republican strategists point out that Latinos will respond to
the right message and messenger. They cite mayoral races in two
cities with large Hispanic populations.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani received 40 percent of the
Hispanic vote, and Richard Riordan of Los Angeles got 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who is building a
large Hispanic following that supporters are confident will
mushroom into a national constituency if he decides to run for
president.
</P>
<P>
   If Democrats have dominated the Latino constituency, it is
largely because they are better _ a lot better _ at exploiting the
issues and playing to Latino emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latinos have no problem with voting Republican,'' says Arturo
Vargas, executive director of the National Association of Latino
Elected Officials Educational Fund, which counts 5,400 members.
``They have shown it in the past, like in l984, when they gave
Reagan over 40 percent of their vote. It means the Republican Party
has the potential to attract Latinos. The Republicans have to
examine what has succeeded and what has driven Latinos away.''
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Gonzalez, president of the Willie C. Velasquez
Institute, suggests that the GOP was punished in 1996 by Latino
voters for its so-called extremist positions, but it doesn't mean
that Latinos have banished it forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``1998 will be the measure of whether this is a long-term trend;
I don't think it is,'' he says. ``The issues will not be the same,
and if you examine the polling trends, many Latinos consider
themselves undecided or independent.''
</P>
<P>
   A Tomas Rivera Policy Institute poll that asked if Latino voters
``lean'' toward Democrats, Republicans or ``neither way,'' 64
percent in California, 67 percent in Florida and 69 percent in
Texas gave the last answer.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans and their NMC are aware of Latino voting
tendencies by now, but since gaining a majority in Congress in
1994, Republicans have provided proof for critics who say the party
is anti-Latino.
</P>
<P>
   Every bit of English-only legislation was sponsored by a
Republican, and welfare and immigration reforms were spearheaded by
Republicans. If the Republican Party can acknowledge past mistakes
and make an honest effort to win Latinos to its style of
government, it's in for better times.
</P>
<P>
   If it fails once again, the consequences will again be
self-inflicted, and, many predict, long-lasting.

``lean'' toward Democrats, Republicans or ``neither way,'' 64
percent in California, 67 percent in Florida and 69 percent in
Texas gave the last answer.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans and their NMC are aware of Latino voting
tendencies by now, but since gaining a majority in Congress in
1994, Republicans have provided proof for critics who say the party
is anti-Latino.
</P>
<P>
   Every bit of English-only legislation was sponsored by a
Republican, and welfare and immigration reforms were spearheaded by
Republicans. If the Republican Party can acknowledge past mistakes
and make an honest effort to win Latinos to its style of
government, it's in for better times.
</P>
<P>
   If it fails once again, the consequences will again be
self-inflicted, and, many predict, long-lasting.

 By CRISTINA SARALEGUI  
 From ``My Life as a Blonde'' 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It isn't easy to be rich.
 &HT;    Everyone wants the people who make it to have started at the
bottom. I didn't start at the bottom, I must admit.
 &HT;    My grandfather was a millionaire. In Cuba he was called the
Paper Czar because he was co-owner of the most important magazines
on the island and also held the monopoly for selling paper.
 &HT;    I was born in Miramar, a wealthy suburb of Havana, where
everyone's main worry was to make sure that during hurricane season
his yacht was secured at the club. I lived in Miramar until we had
to emigrate to Miami in 196O, shortly after Fidel Castro's
revolution had overthrown the dictator Fulgencio Batista.
 &HT;    In the United States, I faced something I had never known:
prejudice. In those early days there were not many Latinos in
Miami. And even though I was blond, with light eyes, my accent and
behavior were unmistakably foreign to the ``natives.''
 &HT;    I didn't understand why I was called ``spic,'' until someone
explained that the word came from the way a Spanish speaker
pronounces the word ``speak,'' shortening the vowel to spic. But
then I couldn't understand why they said, ``Hey, spic, why don't
you go back where you came from?'' when none of the ancestors of
those ``natives'' were from the United States either.
 &HT;    I enrolled in the University of Miami, where I studied
communications with a minor in creative writing. During the last
year of the course, the university required an internship with some
publication.
 &HT;    I chose Vanidades because of my deep sentimental ties to that
magazine. My family had just sold it to a Venezuelan publisher and
his partner. I thought, All right, I'll work as an intern for a
year, and that's the last they'll see of me.
 &HT;    I learned to write every kind of article, from pieces on beauty
and fashion to international news. Then when Frank Calderon, the
editor in chief of Buenhogar (the Spanish version of Good
Housekeeping) was appointed editor of Cosmopolitan en Espanol and
the first thing he did was to hire me from Vanidades as his first
staff writer.
 &HT;    Like a good Cosmo girl, I was 26 and decided to move from our
home on Key Biscayne and rent a small apartment. My father was
going through one of his hard times and was trying to sell the
mansion on Key Biscayne to cut back on expenses. I moved, both to
be independent and not to be a burden on my parents.
 &HT;    I must admit that I had a more difficult time than other girls
my age because I was totally spoiled and immature.
 &HT;    My first excursion into cleaning consisted of buying two spray
cans of foaming cleanser: one for the bathroom, the other for the
oven. From time to time I mixed them up and cleaned the bathroom
with the oven cleaner and the oven with the one for the bathroom.
 &HT;    My mailbox was overflowing with bills. My money ran out because
I earned so little, and I began to lose my credit. My father was
now flat broke and couldn't help me either. I kept moving to
cheaper and cheaper apartments.
 &HT;    Eventually I realized my life was a mess, and I knew I had to
calm down.
 &HT;    One of the young men I was going out with was named Tony
Menendez. He was a firefighter and real estate salesman. I told
myself, ``I need to slow down and have a baby. This is a good man,
and I know he will be a good father.'' I was that cool in my
calculations.
 &HT;    I married him and a year later, at 29, had my first daughter,
Cristina Amalia Menendez y Saralegui, whom we called Titi. When our
daughter was born, Tony and I moved into a small house on Key
Biscayne.
 &HT;    As time went by, I realized that my husband, although he was
working every day (and getting dressed every day in jacket and
tie), simply wasn't selling anything. We had to move into my
father's three-room apartment, with my dachshund, which was covered
with fleas that immediately infested my mother's carpet.
 &HT;    One day my husband said, ``You have to get a job and help out.''
 &HT;    I looked him straight in the eye and said; ``I left my job to
start a family with you. If you ask me to go back to work, you'd
better be ready for whatever happens.''
 &HT;    I wasn't capable of working in an office from 9 to 5 and
trudging home like an automaton to pick up my life. That was work,
not a career. And for me it had to be a career.
 &HT;    I went to Cosmo and visited my former boss. ``I'm sorry,'' he
told me.
 &HT;    On my way out of the building, in desperation I turned and went
to see Elvira Mendoza, whom I had left in the lurch at Vanidades to
go work for Cosmopolitan.
 &HT;    ``Elvira, I have a baby girl now. Here's her picture,'' I began.
 &HT;    She answered, ``What a beautiful child!''
 &HT;    Then it all poured out. I told her the truth and confessed that
I needed a job.
 &HT;    Her reply was instantaneous. ``Well, of course, I'll give you a
job.''
 &HT;    So I came full circle back to where I'd begun, because she paid
me almost the same salary I'd started at, the lowest scale allowed.
 &HT;    I worked at all hours. I did anything they told me. The owner
suggested that I take on the additional responsibility of being
editorial coordinator for Intimidades, a new small-format magazine
in Caracas, Venezuela, that focused primarily on information about
sexuality.
 &HT;    I worked the whole day at Vanidades, writing and editing. Then,
at 5 o'clock, I would save my article on the computer, get into my
car, eat a sandwich as I drove, pick up my baby from the sitter,
put her in her car seat and take her to the home of my
mother-in-law, Marieta, a saint who worked at a factory that made
ballet and exercise clothing.
 &HT;    I would run back to my office, sit back down at the computer,
and with that crazy schedule we got Intimidades under way.
 &HT;    Then one day Frank Calderon, for reasons I don't know to this
day, banged his typewriter against his desk and walked out. The
management offered me his position as editor in chief of
Cosmopolitan.
 &HT;    I was terrified. But I accepted for two reasons: hunger and
ambition. My daughter had turned me into a career woman. And
careers are like children: They grow! I had to dare to grow with
mine.
 &HT;    That was MY CAUSE during the 10 years I directed Cosmopolitan.
Little by little I shaped the magazine to be a motivating force for
working women.
 &HT;    Here are some of the things I've learned:
 &HT;    _ List in a notebook the most important things in your life,
family, job, health, etc.
 &HT;    _ On the basis of those principles, define the goals you want to
reach.
 &HT;    _ Every goal must have a deadline, whether 20 years or two
months.
 &HT;    My goals have been varied because I am convinced that happiness
leads to success but that we are happy only when we achieve a
balance in our lives.
 &HT;    That's why I divide my goals into categories:
 &HT;    _ Cultural goals: Take classes in a foreign language, read a
book every two weeks.
 &HT;    _ Family goals: Have a lasting marriage and children who become
good men and women.
 &HT;    _ Spiritual goals: Read everything that might open the eyes of
my spirit and help my soul evolve.
 &HT;    Every morning review your goals for self-improvement and keep
the last day of the month to check, point by point, what you have
done to reach them.
 &HT;    Begin right now.

 By CRISTINA SARALEGUI  
 From ``My Life as a Blonde'' 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    One day a representative of CBS Records called to ask me a favor
with these fateful words:
 &HT;    ``We just signed a local group called Miami Sound Machine. We're
going to book them into Regine's in New York and launch them as the
company's new artists and we need you to back us up in print.''
 &HT;    At the same time _ life's little coincidences _ another friend,
a newspaperman in Puerto Rico, had called to say that he was
organizing a festival of Caribbean music in Cancun, Mexico, and he
wanted me to recommend the hottest U.S. group playing Latin music.
 &HT;    I recommended Miami Sound Machine.
 &HT;    On the plane carrying us to the festival in Cancun I met Emilio
and Gloria Estefan and (by chance!) Marcos Avila, the band's bass
player.
 &HT;    Emilio and Gloria were very pleasant companions during that
trip, and we quickly became friends, so spontaneously and sincerely
that soon Tony and I began hanging out with them. Since we lived
only five minutes away, we went everywhere together.
 &HT;    Seeing them, watching how happily they were married, I realized
how unhappy I was. I began to realize that following their example
of working together and getting ahead together, I had to change the
circumstances I found myself in.
 &HT;    One day Emilio said, ``I'm going to Peru with Gloria and the
band. You've filed for divorce. Your problems are out of your
hands. Why don't you let me invite you to come with us?''
 &HT;    It was my destiny to meet my destiny.
 &HT;    Emilio who's always joking, began selling me on Marcos, I don't
know why. He said over and over, ``Marcos Avila is my right hand
and a very serious fellow. Why don't you two get together?''
 &HT;    Now I believe that maybe Emilio sensed the chemistry between
Marcos and me before the things happened I'm going to tell you
about.
 &HT;    But I listened and thought, ``Marcos is short, fat,
short-tempered and close-mouthed. And he's married! I like tall,
handsome, elegant men. And I'm short-tempered too. We'd make a
terrible couple!''
 &HT;    One night we all went to a discotheque. I was at Gloria and
Emilio's table but had gone to the ladies' room. There I saw a
black girl and a white girl get in a fight _ with razor blade _
over a musician.
 &HT;    The musician was Marcos! I froze. I did what you do on automatic
pilot and, eyes straight ahead, walked out the door.
 &HT;    As I stepped outside, Marcos came up and said, ``Want to
dance?''
 &HT;    ``Not on your life!'' I answered, and went back to the table to
see how everything turned out.
 &HT;    That night Marcos explained that he was going through the stage
of total upheaval that precedes a divorce. Sometimes he left home
and took refuge in his grandmother's house, where he hid out before
going back to his own house to see his baby girl.
 &HT;    As for me, my husband and I were legally separated.
 &HT;    We were two miserable souls that met like homeless people under
a bridge. Marcos says today that by then he had determined to
captivate me. It's true, we began to see each other differently.
 &HT;    One night after a concert, we all got together in a suite and
had a tremendous party. Afterward Marcos offered to walk me back to
my room. He came in with me, sat on my bed, began to massage my
back, and said, ``If you and I make love ... ''
 &HT;    He corrected himself. ``No. When you and I make love, you're
going to see what a real man is like.''
 &HT;    I pretended I hadn't heard him. I quickly told him good night,
gave him a stupid kiss on the cheek, and he left. But I was left
with that promise in my heart. The next day I got up at 6 a.m. and
carefully painted my toenails red.
 &HT;    That night he came back, and he was better than his promise. It
was like making love with someone for whom you had been created
with that one purpose in mind. The earth moved, bells rang and I
was left stupefied because that had never happened to me and I was
35 years old!
 &HT;    It was well worth painting my toenails.
 &HT;    From that moment Marcos began his campaign to move into my house
so I wouldn't go out with anyone else. He intended that after eight
years of marriage to one man I should pass directly to him, with no
romantic interlude in between.
 &HT;    Marcos is 11 years younger than I am. At that time he had a
ponytail halfway down his back, but a buzz cut in front. And he had
an earring. After all, he was a musician.
 &HT;    My parents were totally opposed to our relationship. My first
marriage had been plagued by economic problems. At one point my
father asked if I was proposing to support men all my life.
 &HT;    To add to the complications, Titi, my daughter, was a holy
terror! I remember the first day Marcos came to the house. Titi had
some plastic handcuffs, and under the pretense of playing cops and
robbers, she cuffed him to the metal stairway and threw away the
key--so he couldn't be with me. We had to break the handcuffs to
get them off.
 &HT;    Faced with that situation, I told Marcos, ``You'll have to win
Titi over, because I'm not going to marry you if she doesn't want
me to.''
 &HT;    By the end of our first year together, Titi was so fond of
Marcos that she told me one day, ``Mami, he loves us. He's nice.
Why don't we marry him?''
 &HT;    All I could do was laugh!
 &HT;    For the wedding I wore a white cotton dress I'd bought in
Mexico, and Titi wore one just like it. I bought white flowers for
my hair and white flowers for hers. She stood by my side in her
identical white dress, and the two of us wed Marcos Avila.
 &HT;    Later, despite his success and the money he was earning, and
after 12 unbroken years with Miami Sound Machine, he decided to
leave the group. ``I've had the fans, the limousines, the Johnny
Carson show,'' he said. ``Now I want a family.''
 &HT;    Marcos opened a public relations agency to offer to
Spanish-language performers the things he had learned while
traveling with Miami Sound Machine.
 &HT;    Once Marcos felt he was on solid ground, he began brainwashing
me to leave Cosmopolitan. My reaction was: Are you crazy?
 &HT;    Marcos, though, convinced me that what I was doing in that
corporation was selling my time instead of my talent.
 &HT;    Take note, all you reading this book, of that important
difference, whatever your situation at the moment.

NEW MOON BOOK RAISES CHARGES, COUNTERCHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH P. KAHN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new book by the former daughter-in-law of Unification Church
leader Rev. Sun Myung Moon has spawned charges of plagiarism
against the book's authors _ one of whom is a Boston Globe
columnist _ and countercharges that the church is orchestrating a
``smear campaign'' against a prominent defector.
</P>
<P>
   The book, titled ``In the Shadow of the Moons'' and published
this month by Little, Brown, is a scalding memoir by Nansook Hong
of Lexington, Mass. about her marriage into, and troubled exit
from, the Moon family's inner circle. Eileen McNamara, the Globe's
Pulitzer Prize-winning Metro columnist, collaborated on the memoir
with Hong, although ghostwriter McNamara's name appears nowhere in
the text or on the book jacket.
</P>
<P>
   McNamara and Hong have been targeted by a pair of accusers who
maintain that ``Shadow of the Moons'' borrows liberally _ too
liberally _ from a book about the Unification Church by George D.
Chryssides. Both McNamara and Hong deny the accusation.
</P>
<P>
   Chryssides, a professor of religious studies in England,
published his book, ``The Advent of Sun Myung Moon,'' in 1991.
While Hong's book spills secrets about drug use, gambling,
adultery, and domestic violence within the Moon family,
Chryssides's work focuses largely on church history and doctrine,
subjects that Hong's book treats only peripherally.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter faxed to Globe editor Matthew V. Storin Friday,
Chryssides contends that a careful comparison of the two texts
``reveals that several passages have been plagiarized'' and that
other passages and quotes were used without proper authorization or
attribution. Chryssides provided no supporting material. However, a
separate letter sent to the Globe by Moon family attorney Jeremiah
Gutman repeated Chryssides's charges and did specify passages,
eight in all.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a Globe inquiry, Little, Brown attorney Heather
Kirkpatrick termed the charges ``unfounded and without merit of any
kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Kirkpatrick, ``The `parallels' cited by Dr. Chryssides are
factual statements of the history and tradition of the Unification
Church which have appeared in many publications on the subject. The
resulting similarities do not constitute plagiarism.''
</P>
<P>
   Chryssides's accusations all deal with passages involving church
ritual and lore. McNamara contends that many sources recount
similar stories using similar words. However, in at least two of
the examples cited by Gutman, there are textual similarities,
notably in stories about the House of Three Doors and the legend of
the ``great ancestor'' Tangun.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early days of the Unification Church, in 1954,'' writes
Chryssides of the Three Doors, ``the Rev. Moon and his followers
resided in a small house in Seoul, which had only two very small
rooms with a small kitchen. The house was popularly called the
`House of the Three Doors.' ...''
</P>
<P>
   On Page 25 of the Hong book, this passage appears: ``In the
early days of the Unification Church, members met in a small house
with two rooms. It was known as the House of Three Doors.''
</P>
<P>
   McNamara acknowledges having read Chryssides's book and using
it, along with as many as 34 other sources, as research material.
McNamara says she urged Little, Brown to publish a bibliography and
chapter notes with Hong's text, which the publisher concedes it
declined to do. In addition, says McNamara, Chryssides and others
have themselves borrowed liberally from church lore, which Hong
memorized during her years in the church and later repeated to
McNamara.
</P>
<P>
   Of the House of Three Doors, says McNamara, ``That's the way Nan
told me the story. I did read Chryssides's book. I read a lot of
books. I did not plagiarize from Mr. Chryssides.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached in England last week, Chryssides declined to comment,
saying he was seeking the advice of lawyers representing his
British publisher. He did not return a call placed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gutman said Tuesday that he has never met Chryssides and has
only spoken to him once, after receiving a copy of the letter the
author sent to the Globe and ``60 Minutes,'' which broadcast an
interview with Hong Sunday. He denied knowing of any ties between
Chryssides and the Unification Church and rejected charges that
Moon and his followers are out to discredit Hong or her book.
</P>
<P>
   Gutman represented Hong's ex-husband in the couple's divorce
proceedings. Late last year, Moon lawyers tried to limit Hong's
publicity efforts on behalf of the book by invoking a clause in the
divorce agreement prohibiting actions by Hong that would be
detrimental to the couple's children _ including, the lawyers
alleged, Hong's speaking publicly about her ex-husband's behavior.
Middlesex Probate Judge Edward Ginsberg, who presided over the
divorce procedings, dismissed the petition.
</P>
<P>
   Little, Brown publisher Sarah Crichton characterizes the charges
against Hong and McNamara as ``clearly part of the church's many
attempts to discredit this book. To call this plagiarism amounts to
a smear campaign. It's outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Tuesday, Storin said, ``We are pleased
by the statement of Little, Brown refuting the charges made by Dr.
George Chryssides against Eileen McNamara as ghostwriter of the
book, `In the Shadow of the Moons.' We have the highest regard for
Eileen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the Boston Globe had no control over the content or
editing of'' the book, the statement concluded. ``Indeed, we had no
prior knowledge of the material nor any relationship with its
publication.''
</P>
<P>
   Hong, who was on a book tour in New York Tuesday, said through
her publisher: ``They have tried to stop this book before. I've
been expecting some kind of attack. This is one way for them to try
to discredit me and the book _ as well as my integrity.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was a fateful day of fear, tears, frantic phone
calls, and reading Psalm 21 ``about a million times,'' Monica S.
Lewinsky told grand jurors last month. She detailed for the first
time the events of Jan. 16: being set up by Linda R. Tripp, seized
by the FBI, and misled by prosecutors pursuing the story of her
affair with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's recollections of that day, released with other
impeachment-related evidence by the House Judiciary Committee on
Monday, are at odds with earlier news accounts from sources in the
office of independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr. Earlier accounts
described the former White House intern's encounter with the law in
a suburban Ritz-Carlton Hotel as stressful but not hostile or
intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so incredibly frightening,'' Lewinsky tearfully told
the grand jury Aug. 20, adding that it wasn't until her mother
arrived at the hotel nine hours into the session that Lewinsky got
an attorney and was told she was not going to be arrested and put
in jail for refusing to cooperate with Starr's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 12, Tripp told Starr's office she had secretly
tape-recorded hours of conversations with Lewinsky, a friend and
colleague at the Pentagon, about Lewinsky's affair with the
president. Tripp said Lewinsky lied about it, and also advised
Tripp to lie, under oath in the Paula Jones case. The next day, the
FBI wired Tripp to record more, and within three days Starr had set
up a sting operation to bring in Lewinsky for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky believed she was meeting Tripp for lunch in the food
court of the shopping mall next to the Ritz-Carlton. But when Tripp
showed up at about 12:45 p.m., she had two FBI agents in tow.
</P>
<P>
   ``They flashed their badges at me,'' Lewinsky told the grand
jurors. ``They told me that I was under some kind of investigation,
something that had to do with the Paula Jones case, that they
wanted to talk to me and give me a chance to cooperate, maybe _ to
help myself.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Starr's account in the documents released Monday,
the FBI agents told Lewinsky she was not under arrest but was
suspected of committing a federal crime.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Lewinsky said she refused to go to the hotel room and
meet with Starr's prosecutors without having a lawyer of her own.
But the FBI agents persuaded her that if she came alone, she could
get more information on both the investigation and how much trouble
she was in, Lewinsky said. ``So I agreed to go. I was so scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Emmick, one of Starr's associate counsels, greeted
Lewinsky in the hotel room and, according to Lewinsky, told her
that Attorney General Janet Reno had given Starr the go-ahead to
investigate her and possibly charge her with perjury, obstruction
of justice, subornation of perjury, and witness tampering based on
the tapes and her false affidavit in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid all that, Lewinsky said the lawyers suggested she could
tell them the full story of her affair with President Clinton as
well as cooperate in taping incriminating conversations with Betty
Currie, the president's personal secretary; Vernon E. Jordan Jr.,
his confidant; and perhaps the president himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt so bad,'' said Lewinsky, who told the grand jurors she
wondered if there might be a way to signal to her friends that she
was wearing a wire. She dismissed the idea when Starr's lawyers
told her ``they would be watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Things did not go well between Lewinsky and the lawyers, by
either account. Lewinsky said she was crying, worried she would
harm Clinton, missing her mother, who was in New York, and puzzled
about how the lawyers knew what was in her affidavit being filed
that day.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was nervous about calling her own attorney, Frank
Carter, because he was a friend of Jordan's, who might pass news of
the developments to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Lewinsky said, the prosecutors ``didn't think it was a
good idea'' for her to call Carter, because he was a civil lawyer
``and really couldn't help me, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sounds as though they were actively discouraging you from
talking to an attorney,'' one of the grand jurors said to Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Lewinsky answered.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky said she tried to ignore Starr's lawyers _ now six of
them _ who were crowding the hotel room and telling her she was
under a ``time constraint'' to decide about cooperating in exchange
for some kind of immunity. She was getting frantic, Lewinsky said,
as well as increasingly mistrustful of the prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   According to a chronology compiled by Starr's lawyers, the first
seven hours with Lewinsky were spent catering to her needs with
bottled water, a towel, more air conditioning, frequent bathroom
breaks, aspirin, a quick trip to Macy's, and dinner at Mozzarella's
American Grill. ``Lewinsky paid for her portion of the dinner,''
Starr's report said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's lawyers finally let Lewinsky summon her mother, Marcia
Lewis, who took a slow train from New York. Lewinsky said she was
``hysterical'' when she told her mother ``the FBI had me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're 24, you're smart, you're old enough, you don't need to
call your mommy,'' deputy independent counsel Jackie Bennett Jr.
told Lewinsky. She said she replied: ``Well, I'm letting you know
that I am leaning toward not cooperating.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Lewinsky, Starr's attorneys ``said I should know
that they were planning to prosecute my mom for the things that I
had said she had done.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis arrived shortly after 10 p.m. While Lewinsky read and
reread Psalm 21, presumably from a hotel-room Bible, her mother met
with the prosecutors and explained she wanted to protect her
daughter, whom she described as ``emotional ... and younger than
her chronological age,'' according to Starr. Lewis confided that
Lewinsky had ``talked about suicide'' six years before and had seen
a therapist.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis knew about her daughter's relationship with the president.
Bernard Lewinsky, Monica's father and Lewis's former husband, did
not, but Lewis called him anyway to retain a lawyer. Lewinsky, a
California oncologist, had William Ginsburg, a medical malpractice
attorney, call Lewis and Lewinsky at the hotel, according to the
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky had already decided not to cooperate with Starr, she
said, a decision Ginsburg endorsed. Emmick told Ginsburg, as he had
told Lewinsky earlier, that the women were free to leave the hotel
room.
</P>
<P>
   According to Starr's chronology, Lewinsky and Lewis departed at
12:30 a.m., and ``thanked the agents and staff of the Office of
Independent Counsel for being so kind and considerate.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Aug. 20, grand jurors pressed Lewinsky to describe the
events at the Ritz-Carlton. Emmick _ who had questioned Lewinsky at
the hotel _ was in charge of the grand jury that day and tried to
steer the jurors away from the topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe, if I could ask, what areas do you want to get into ...
this was a long day ... there were a lot of things that ...,''
Emmick began, before the jurors cut him off with demands that
Lewinsky be heard.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky told the story but first requested that Emmick leave
the courtroom.

VIEWS DIFFER ON JORDAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Monica S. Lewinsky described Vernon E. Jordan Jr.
as the only person ``who did what he said he was going to do for
me.'' President Clinton said he's ``never known him to say anything
that wasn't true.''
</P>
<P>
   But from the evidence gathered by independent counsel Kenneth W.
Starr, a more complicated portrait of Jordan, the prominent lawyer,
Washington power broker, and longtime Clinton friend, has emerged.
</P>
<P>
   According to Starr, Jordan was part of an effort to cover up the
affair between the president and Lewinsky, a former White House
intern. Through the testimony of Clinton and Lewinsky, Jordan is
portrayed as a trusted friend and committed problem solver.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, it's not clear whether the savvy Jordan believed
Clinton's and Lewinsky's denials of an affair, or whether he simply
looked the other way.
</P>
<P>
   It was Jordan to whom Lewinsky turned, after she got the
president's approval, to help find a job outside Washington, she
testified. It was Jordan who helped her find a lawyer to prepare an
affidavit after she was subpoenaed by Paula Jones's attorneys in
their sexual-harrassment suit against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   And it was Jordan who called the White House to alert Clinton
that Lewinsky had been subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has publicly said he did not know about the relationship
between Clinton and Lewinsky, and that he helped the former White
House intern find a job as he had helped many other young people.
</P>
<P>
   A key question for investigators is whether Jordan knew of the
affair and offered to help Lewinsky in an attempt to buy her
silence.
</P>
<P>
   The answer may be buried in the grand jury testimony, including
Jordan's, that has not been released by the House Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Lewinsky testified that ``no one ever asked me to
lie and I was never promised a job for my silence.'' She also said
she felt guilty about lying about Jordan to Linda Tripp, Lewinsky's
onetime friend and former colleague at the Pentagon who secretly
taped recorded phone conversations she had with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lewinsky's testimony, she told Tripp that she had
said to Jordan: ``No job, no affidavit.'' But that was untrue,
Lewinsky testified.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his testimony, did not challenge prosecutors'
descriptions of Jordan's testimony. At one point, the president
said of Jordan, ``If he has a specific memory of when I had some
conversation on a certain day, I would be inclined to trust his
memory over mine.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's testimony revealed the depth of their bond. He
said Jordan has been a friend of two decades or more. ``I would
talk to Vernon Jordan about nearly everything'' he said. ``I
probably would have talked to Vernon Jordan about the Monica
Lewinsky problem if he had never been involved in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked at one point whether he had lied to aides and friends,
including Jordan, Clinton said: ``I recall telling a number of
those people that I didn't have _ either I didn't have an affair
with Monica Lewinsky or I didn't have sex with her. And I believe,
sir, that you will have to ask them what they thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, in her testimony, left the impression that Jordan
looked the other way during the affair. She said Tripp made her
think that Jordan ``kind of knew with a wink and a nod.''
</P>
<P>
   In one meeting with him, Lewinsky recalled Jordan referring to
her as a friend of the president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I remarked that I didn't _ I didn't really look at him as
the president, that I saw him more as a man and reacted to him more
as a man and got angry at him like a man and just a regular
person,'' Lewinsky testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Mr. Jordan asked me what I got angry at the president
about, so I told him when he doesn't call me enough or see me
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sort of bantering back and forth about that and then
he told me that I shouldn't get angry at the president because he's
got a lot of _ it sounds so stupid _ obviously, he has a lot of
other more important things and difficult things to deal with than
someone getting upset with him. And he suggested that if I was
upset that I should call and take my frustrations out on Mr. Jordan
instead of the president.''
</P>
<P>
   After that conversation, Lewinsky said Jordan told her, ```Well,
you know what your problem is?' And I said, `What?'
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Don't deny it ... You're in love, that's what your
problem is.' So I think I just _ probably blushed or giggled,
something like that,'' Lewinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky also testified that he told her there were two
important questions regarding her affidavit: ``Did you have sex
with the president, you know, or did he (Clinton) ask?' And I said
no to both of those.''
</P>
<P>
   But she added, ``When he asked me those questions, I thought he
was asking me, saying essentially, `What are you going to say?' not
necessarily asking me directly what _ you know, `What are the
answers to these questions?' More `What are you going to reply in
regard to the case?'''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky also left the impression of Jordan as naive, even
somewhat puritanical and narrow-minded. When she asked him to give
the president a hug because he would be seeing Clinton at the White
House one night, Jordan responded, ``I don't hug men.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Dec. 22, during another visit to Jordan's office, Lewinsky
said she expressed concern that someone may have listened to calls
between her and the president. When Jordan responded that the
president was allowed to call people, Lewinsky said ``Well, we've
had phone sex. And so Mr. Jordan said, `Well, what's phone sex? ...
I'm just an old man. I don't know what phone sex is.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's testimony depicted Jordan as someone whose loyalty to
the president might lead him to try to interfere with the Jones
civil suit. Lewinsky testified that during a New Year's Eve
breakfast meeting, when she warned him that Tripp may have seen
some notes she had written to the president, Jordan told her: ``Go
home and make sure they're not there,'' which she took to mean to
throw them away.
</P>
<P>
   As they were riding from breakfast in the car, Lewinsky said she
asked Jordan if he thought Clinton would always be married to
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, as he should be,'' Lewinsky recalled Jordan saying.
</P>
<P>
   She said Jordan quoted from the Bible. ``And a few _ maybe a
minute or so later, he said, `Well, maybe you two will have an
affair when he's out of office.'''

   WEST HORSLEY, England _ It is morning and the house hums with
the sounds of making ready for school.
</P>
<P>
   It's the familiar calamity of searching for a clean shirt,
digging through drawers for lunch money, forging a breakfast from
the odd piece of bread or banana and barking tired parental
commands -- ``Put on your socks, NOW!''
</P>
<P>
   The difference here is that my sons, their Southern accents and
American ways obvious to all, are preparing to go to English
schools.
</P>
<P>
   My big son, a 14-year-old who refers to himself as a ``troubled
genius,'' and my 4-year-old, who is given to asking strangers why
they are fat, wrinkled or bald, dress in their uniforms each
weekday and head off to schools where they are the only Americans.
</P>
<P>
   My big son wears the black-and-yellow striped tie of the
Sheridan House at the Howard of Effingham School. He seems
surprisingly mature in his black blazer and dark gray trousers. On
the first day of school, he wondered aloud if we weren't sending
him to undertaker academy.
</P>
<P>
   My small son wears dark gray shorts, gray knee socks, a white
golf shirt and a kelly green pullover with the deer insignia of the
Raleigh School.
</P>
<P>
   After years of debating with our big son the precise meaning of
words such as ``filthy,'' ``ripped'' and ``nerdy,'' it is
reassuring to see him dressed in a way that even I can comprehend.
And with my small son, it is comforting to see him dressed as the
other little ones, a harmony that suggests a feeling of belonging
in a still alien place.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, a recovering advertising professional, and I thought
that such an experience would be the main point in moving to
England. Yet, other Americans, many of whom send their children to
American schools with American kids, seem shocked by our decision.
At a meeting of a book club of American women the other day, gazes
of incredulity fell upon my wife when she let slip that our sons
are in English schools. One woman even asked if we weren't worried
about the damage we were doing our sons.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, it is a complex proposition. The curriculum doesn't
translate directly, and there is a decided difference in approach
here. One headmaster described it this way: English schools provide
information; American schools provide reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, we even detected a subtle prejudice here against
American schools. During pre-admission interviews, administrators
often would reassure us, at times in vaguely patronizing tones,
that they understood the ``special'' needs of American kids in
science and math. One school wanted our big son to start class with
younger kids.
</P>
<P>
   He wisely revolted against this idea and chose a school where he
was offered a place with kids his age. He now scoffs at the math
and can almost understand the science. So there!
</P>
<P>
   Among their classmates, both boys are novelties. On his first
day, my small son was confronted by bigger boys who proclaimed a
dislike for Americans because his father had told him that we are
evil gun toters. My big son has been questioned about such topics
as the alarming surplus of fat people in America. Occasionally,
there is the thing about language: they laugh at my son's calling
the ``pavement,'' ``sidewalks'' and ``bum bags,'' ``fanny packs.''
He has taken a fancy to using the word ``fancy,'' and uses the word
``soccer'' only in the privacy of home.
</P>
<P>
   For all the difficulties, the boys seem to be thriving. And,
perhaps most importantly, in learning so much about other people,
they are learning a great deal more about themselves.

CLINTON GETS THE BETTER OF STARR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget about impeachment. Ditto on resignation. The Republicans
will keep beating the dead horse named after Monica till the
Wednesday after the elections, then vote for censure.
</P>
<P>
   It looks like game, set, and match for the Get Clinton mob. The
polls will start rolling in.
</P>
<P>
   My prediction for the final score: Bill Clinton 2, Kenneth Starr
1. The Democrats will lose some close House and Senate fights,
maybe even some governorships, on depressed turnout, with
presidential morals, or lack thereof, demoralizing many Democratic
voters.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton presidency should run to full term, though
diminished in clout. His inquisitors discover the downside of what
happens after if you fail to slay the king. By rubbing our nose in
this scandal's dirty underwear, the congressional Republicans
overplayed their hand. You have to ask the same question about them
as we all ask about Clinton and his penchant for female trouble:
Don't they ever learn?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's performance was vintage Bill. Starr's prosecutorial
pack had Slick William cornered at last. Using the spurious excuse
of a grand juror's absence, Starr invoked a video camera to get the
president squirming and sweating on tape. Apparently, Starr feared
Clinton using his vaunted skills to charm the jurors, just as
Monica did, bonding with their instinct for humanity, a quality
Starr's engine of vengeance clearly does without.
</P>
<P>
   Having milked the media, salted the leaks into every
journalistic crevice extant, cranked up the GOP Scandal Machine,
and prepped every right winger abroad to go on TV and vent _ does
William Bennett have a day job, or does he just make the rounds of
cable studios? _ Starr sought the coup de grace with the hot home
video for his trophy case.
</P>
<P>
   Except Clinton demolished his inquisitors in the video the House
Republicans thought would cripple him permanently. It was the
faceless questioners, with their shameless pawing over
``genitalia'' and more, who earned the contempt of millions.
</P>
<P>
   On split-screen, Clinton strolled into the United Nations, where
the world leaders stood as one and applauded louder and longer than
they'd ever applauded this president, with Nelson Mandela, the
planet's most revered statesman, leading the tribute. CNN brought
word from Germany that doughty old Helmut Kohl said he felt like
vomiting at what the Congress and Starr were doing to the free
world's preminent leader at a time of economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   For four hours plus, Clinton sat in Starr's grim chamber, a
relentless video camera grinding away, answering questions no one
would want to face. And did it brilliantly. Not completely, not
unevasively, not voluntarily, not fully cooperatively. Just
brilliantly. He refused to take the cheese, every time Starr's men
baited the trap. With a canny politician's instinct, he seemed to
know the tape would eventually be broadcast to a chorus of howls
from his enemies.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers who decry his hair-splitting are now splitting their
own hair on what constitutes perjury or obstruction of justice.
Clinton beat them at their own hair-splitting game.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke to the camera, his questioners, and the grand jurors,
but his real audience was the nation. What we saw was a flawed man,
who succumbed to temptation, who called Monica a good girl, a smart
girl, a nice girl, when we know she was screwed up, volatile,
unprincipled, unstable, and, alas, ditzy, dumb in her conduct, her
dreamy career planning, and in choice of friends. Clinton properly
blamed himself, not her.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's hench-prosecutors took turns crafting their most
intrusive and demeaning queries, trying to goad the clearly
embarrassed and squirming subject into damaging admissions. But
with the cunning of the artful dodger, Clinton avoided voicing the
dirty words the Starr-chamber operatives wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving nothing to our imagination but befuddlement as to why
we'd paid $40 million for this sexual detritus, Starr's
taxpayer-fed lawyers bore into the president. What about those
``genitalia,'' eh, Mr. President? Hmm? Hmm? This was the Church
Lady gone beserk, a Monty Python skit gone horribly wrong. The
Independent Counsel Show was a shocker, all right. But the shock
stemmed from how our legal system has run amok.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI as sexual police, threatening Monica, on Starr's orders,
with 27 years in federal prison or else; with federal judges, even
the Supreme Court, stripping this and every subsequent president of
Secret Service confidentiality, of honest advice from friends or
employees, of privacy, of the integrity of his office, his place of
business, his residence.
</P>
<P>
   You saw how bad it was. Starr, the unelected pharisee, using his
dubious connections with right-wing enemies of Clinton, is a danger
to the Republic. Then all those preachy back-country congressmen,
mouthing their moralistic pieties while they load up the Internet
and our TV screens with Prurience on Parade. Their hysteria is
exceeded only by their hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   Toss in the sputtering outrage of the editorialists, convulsed
by the sad revelations of a Mr. Lonely looking for love in all the
wrong places, and you had a sense of revulsion. But it is revulsion
not just at Clinton and his pathetic antics, but at Starr's
wrecking crew, and their backers, the lusty lawmakers of the
Republican majorities, who seek to inflame the hinterlands against
the duly-elected chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Even the new Miss America got into the act, demanding
resignation, as if on cue from the plugged-in but ultimately
clueless pundit-ocracy who clog our cable channels.
</P>
<P>
   The president is shamed and embarrassed, as well he might be.
But I think he stopped the impeachment tumbril with his virtuoso
rationalizations. I think women voters will save his sorry butt,
one more time. They buy his repentance, and reject his enemies'
lowbrow cunning, from Starr's sex-obsessed privacy-invaders, to the
media jackal-pack that took every cheesy leak, to Clinton's lame
legal team and tongue-tied defenders, to the craven congressional
weathervanes. These all stand diminished, alongside Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP should gain some partisan advantage out of this, but
Bill should still have them to kick around for two more years.

BIOGRAPHY CONTINUES THE REVIVAL OF DAWN POWELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
DAWN POWELL 
By Tim Page 
Holt, 362 pp., illustrated, $30 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In her lifetime, Dawn Powell had a reputation as ``a good
novelist of the second class,'' but some of her influential
literary friends knew better and got on her case. Those who took up
her cause included Edmund Wilson, Diana Trilling, and Gore Vidal,
who called her the best novelist of our American midcentury.
Nevertheless, when Powell died, in 1965, none of her books was in
print, and she wound up in a pauper's grave on Hart Island _ though
as biographer Tim Page observes, she would probably have been
delighted to learn that the city of New York paid for it.
</P>
<P>
   Page, the music critic of the Washington Post, has succeeded
where Wilson, Trilling, and Vidal failed, because he was able to
unsnarl the complications surrounding Powell's literary rights and
to help an ambitious young publishing house, Steerforth Press,
bring the writer forward again. Currently 11 of Powell's 15 novels
are available in handsome editions (``The Happy Island,''
unavailable for nearly 60 years, is the most recent restoration);
the 1995 publication of her diaries, edited and abridged by Page,
also won her many new friends. Page was the architect and engineer
of the Powell revival, but what made it work was the devotion
Powell inspires in readers who discover her. Dawn Powell is now
taught in courses in American literature, which brings her a sort
of posthumous immortality; better still, thousands of people are
reading her books for the sheer and slightly alarming pleasure of
being in her company.
</P>
<P>
   Powell had a difficult and in some ways a sad life. Her Ohio
childhood was full of upheaval, cruelty, and unexpected generosity
on a Dickensian scale; no wonder Dickens was a writer she loved and
``David Copperfield'' one of her favorite books. Her stepmother,
Sabra Stearns Powell, was almost too bad to be true. Dawn's
half-sister died after a life of only 5 days; when Sabra discovered
her daughter had already been buried in unsuitable clothing, she
took her husband and Dawn's sister Phyllis to the cemetery, dug up
the coffin, and clad the body in the dress of Phyllis's only doll.
When Sabra discovered and burned Dawn's early writings, Dawn left
home, for good; she was 13.
</P>
<P>
   A kindly aunt came to the rescure and encouraged Dawn in every
way. The young writer attended Lake Erie College and then fulfilled
the dream of many of the characters in her Ohio novels and moved to
New York, where she remained the rest of her life. For 42 years she
lived in, and outside of, an unconventional marriage with Joseph
Gousha, a colorful and Dickensian character who made his living in
an advertising agency; she left him a lovely and chacteristic
epitaph in her diary: ``I reflected that he was the only person in
the world I found it always a kick to run into on the street.''
Their only child, JoJo, born autistic, was a source of great joy to
them, and of great pain. Gousha was an alcoholic, and Dawn enjoyed
a drink too, although friends said they never saw her drunk, only
``enhanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell lived in Greenwich Village for most of her adult life,
and the parade in which she marched included painters, writers,
composers, the rich and famous, the poor and revolutionary, the
successful and the down-and-out, the gay and the straight, poets,
bartenders, waiters, and cab drivers. She acted in a silent film;
one of her plays, ``Big Night'' was produced by the Group Theater,
and another, ``Jig Saw'' was presented by the Theatre Guild. The
last movie directed by the legendary Erich von Stroheim, ``Hello,
Sister!'' was based on an unproduced play by Powell. She wrote
short stories for magazines and reviewed books, sometime sharply
(tiring of Mary McCarthy's ``magisterially dull'' ``The Oasis,''
she commented on the photo of the author on the dust jacket, the
``pretty author evidently reclining on the other end of Truman
Capote's couch''). At times she lived high on the hog; she also
found herself sitting on the street when her building went co-op.
Her friends relished her wit, but she did not brandish it as a
weapon; personally she was gentle and unassuming, liberated in many
modern ways, conventional in belief in old-fashioned virtues.
</P>
<P>
   What makes her life so interesting is that she wrote about it
and turned it into art in a remarkable series of books, some set in
Ohio and written in the old-fashioned realistic tradition, more of
them set in New York, and written in a smart, satirical style
(Diana Trilling observed that Powell ``really makes the jokes that
Dorothy Parker gets the credit for''). What is interesting about
Powell is that the styles overlapped; there is ruthless comic
observation in the Ohio novels, and what makes the New York novels
memorable is not just the wit but the writer's generously inclusive
heart.
</P>
<P>
   Page as written his book in the nick of time; there are only a
few people left living who knew Powell and her family. But he found
them and earned their trust, just as he earns the reader's trust by
his diligent research, his sympathetic tone, his way of not
pretending to know anything he doesn't. He never makes excuses for
Powell or stakes extravagant claims for the novels; he doesn't set
out to compete with his subject. Readers of Dawn Powell's novels
establish a special relationship to her; they are drawn in by their
enjoyment of her voice, but end up liking her personally _ the way
they like Jane Austen. Page makes an ideal biographer because he
likes Dawn Powell, too.

JEWISH GROUPS PROMOTE US REVIVAL OF HEBREW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like many American Jews, Candace Weiner's schooling in Hebrew
pretty much ended when she was a teenager. Her lack of proficiency
in the language was never really an issue to her. Until last year.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Weiner's 9-year-old daughter started going to Hebrew
school at the family's synagogue in Springfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Weiner says it irritated her that all she could say when her
daughter asked for help with the homework was, ``No, Alexa, I'm
sorry. I can't help you. ... You'll have to wait until your father
comes home.''
</P>
<P>
   After several months, Weiner decided to do something about it.
In a few weeks, she plans to take an eight-hour marathon reading
course in Hebrew at a local Jewish community center.
</P>
<P>
   The class is one of several initiatives aimed at addressing a
worrisome problem for many Jewish leaders _ the widespread lack of
knowledge of Hebrew among US Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems hypocritical of me to tell Alexa to do her homework
when I dropped out of Hebrew school and I know almost nothing of
the language,'' said Weiner, who lives in Longmeadow.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish scholars estimate that as many as 80 percent of the
nearly 6 million Jews in America have virtually no knowledge of
Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Jews worldwide prepare to celebrate Rosh Hashana, the
Jewish New Year that begins at sundown tonight, a national
organization is launching the most ambitious Hebrew literacy
project to date. Read Hebrew America, a five-week crash course,
will be offered free at more than 1,000 sites across the country.
</P>
<P>
   While the course is not expected to make anyone fluent, the
National Jewish Outreach Program's goal is to motivate Jews,
particularly those unaffiliated with a synagogue, to tackle the
subject again.
</P>
<P>
   Many Jewish leaders say the inability of millions of American
Jews to grasp Hebrew is a symptom of the serious erosion of the
American Jewish community's spiritual and cultural roots. Hebrew,
they say, is much more than a means of communication; it is a
window into Judaism's religious and cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every facet of American life, whether it be economic,
academic, civic or entertainment, Jews have accomplished way beyond
anything we could ever have imagined,'' said Rabbi Ephraim
Buchwald, director of the National Jewish Outreach Program in New
York, which is overseeing and funding the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet, despite that, the level of ignorance of Judaism among our
generation is unprecedented in history,'' he said. ``What we're
really trying to do is use Hebrew as a hook to get them back to
being active, informed members of the Jewish community.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchwald said the project was timed to coincide with Rosh
Hashana, the start of the Jewish High Holy Days  &UR;  &LR; that culminate
with Yom Kippur on Sept. 30, because this season is typically when
synagogues draw the largest number of people.
</P>
<P>
   The group hopes to enroll 20,000 Jews nationally.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-hour Hebrew reading marathons already available were
developed 11 years ago by Rabbi Noah Golinkin &UR;  &LR; of Columbia, Md.,
founder of the national Hebrew Literacy Project.
</P>
<P>
   However, Jewish leaders in Boston, recognizing that most Jews
are not fluent in Hebrew, say they have had the most success
offering adult education programs for Jewish studies in English.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Shrage, president of Combined Jewish Philanthropies of
Boston and a national leader in a campaign to spark a renaissance
in Jewish learning, said these courses are popular because,
``You're dealing with a highly educated population who might be
turned off if they walk into a situation where they are made to
feel ignorant because they don't know the language.''
</P>
<P>
   Using English translations of Jewish texts gives ``people
instant access to Jewish learning at a very high intellectual
level, so you don't feel incompetent,'' Shrage added.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Shrage and others say they believe finding ways to
promote Hebrew literacy is crucial to staving off the loss of
Jewish identity caused by assimilation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hebrew is one of the things that have kept Jewish people
together through 2,000 years of exile and diaspora,'' said Shrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that in order to write the Jewish future you need to
be able to read the Jewish past, and the Jewish past is written a
lot in Hebrew,'' said Rabbi Benjamin Lanckton, director of Jewish
education for the Jewish Community Center in Springfield, which is
offering the five-week Read Hebrew America course and the
eight-hour Hebrew reading class.
</P>
<P>
   Hebrew is the sacred language of Shabbat, the Friday night
worship services at the heart of Jewish temple observances. In the
United States, in all but the most Orthodox congregations, services
are held in Hebrew and English, and prayer books contain English
translations.
</P>
<P>
   But many rabbis and Jewish leaders say even the best
translations are no substitute for Hebrew's lyricism. ``There is
rhythm, cadence, emotion and the weight of generations that come
into play when you listen to the prayers in Hebrew,'' said Rabbi
Jonathan Hausman, spiritual leader of Ahavath Torah Congregation in
Stoughton.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Judaism that is completely in translation runs the risk of
being attenuated,'' argued Rabbi Ismar Schorsch, chancellor of the
Jewish Theological Seminary in New York. ``Jewish piety demands
literacy.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; An old Russian adage making the rounds in Moscow these days
cautions: ``You can't cross a hedgehog with a snake.''
</P>
<P>
   The West is now chewing over that maxim. &UR;  &LR; After seven botched
years of throwing billions of dollars and a fiscal straitjacket on
Moscow, Western leaders and economists have discovered that their
institutions and market ideologies aren't easily spliced into
Russia's troubled economy.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as a flock of Soviet-era officials ascended to key
government posts, observers were anxiously wondering what kind of
beast the Russian economy would become.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing answer had little to do with Gosplan, the
planning juggernaut of the Communist era and a hallmark of the
discredited Soviet economic system. But neither did it have much to
do with functioning markets or genuine capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   In rejecting Western remedies in favor of social welfare and
industrial growth, and in opting to finance it all by printing
money and leaning toward curbs on outflows of dollars, Russia is
entering a parlous limbo, neither socialist nor capitalist.
</P>
<P>
   One month after Moscow fell into its steepest economic and
political crisis in years, tripping over a collapsed currency and a
mountain of debt, many observers find it easier to say what the
Russian economy is not rather than what it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what the IMF, Treasury, or G7 would want to see,''
said Salomon Smith Barney analyst Desmond Lachman. ``But they're
not going back to 1989.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't know,'' Lachman said with a sigh.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Dancing to a different tune
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, groping for definitions, last week found themselves
invoking the new self-help rhetoric of Asia's wobbly economies,
using a vocabulary whose terms _ state intervention, currency
controls, capital flow barriers _ reflect new challenges to
Washington's economic orthodoxy. &UR;  &LR; By delaying until this upcoming
week &UR;  &LR; a $40 billion debt rescheduling deal _ a move that could turn
into the biggest default ever by a country _ Russia has become the
latest sick economy to opt for recipes formerly shunned.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia is in far more economic trouble _ and is far
different _ than market mecca Hong Kong, whose government recently
intervened to bolster the stock market, or Malaysia, which has
burned currency traders by abolishing ringgit deals outside the
country.
</P>
<P>
   To grapple with an unstable ruble, huge debts, unpaid salaries
and pensions, and insolvent banks and enterprises, Russia's new
economic team spoke last week of solutions that are the polar
opposite of the agenda preached by the West since the Soviet Union
collapsed in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Now, support for ailing factories and farms, the printing of
more rubles, the restructuring of debts in a way that helps Russian
banks before Western ones, and proposals to limit hard currency
flows have replaced the fiscal austerity, improved tax collection,
and friendly foreign investment laws that Washington wants to see.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``We should give up Argentine tangos and Washington fox
trots,'' populist Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov declared last week,
alluding to Western calls for a Buenos Aires-style currency board
to stabilize the bruised ruble and for more US-led aid.
</P>
<P>
   All this makes Moscow's uncertain economic strategy as big a
challenge to the West's one-size-fits-all reform model for
floundering economies as to the Kremlin, which faces a country in
ruin and few options for revival.
</P>
<P>
   Whether poorly implemented, inherently flawed, or both, Western
solutions could not stave off Russia's collapse. ``The market
economy model that the right policies would create the right
institutions has failed,'' said professor Padma Desai of Columbia
University. ``The reform idea, in the sense of control of
inflation, privatization, and open trading, has failed.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Some of the old, some of the new
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Broke, and a breaker of debt repayment promises, Russia has
locked itself out of the world's capital markets for perhaps a
decade. Its dwindling hard currency and gold reserves cannot
support the ruble indefinitely, which may in time force the
government to fix the ruble after all. Moscow newspapers have been
speculating whether the new Cabinet would re-nationalize key
industries and implement price controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we like it or not, Russia is going in the direction it
has always tried to go in, toward what Russians call a mixed
economy,'' said professor Stephen Cohen of New York University.

REVOLUTION ARE IN SHUTDOWN MODE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just two games remain for the Revolution this season: Wdnesday's
night's match against the Fire in Chicago and Saturday's finale
against the New York/New Jersey MetroStars at Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   Though the team has been mathematically eliminated from the
Major League Soccer playoffs, things have changed a lot since
Walter Zenga took over as coach Aug. 24. The Revolution are 3-1
under his tutelage, with three consecutive shutouts, best in MLS
this season. Ian Feuer has been in net for each of them, and his
teammates have outscored the opposition, 9-1, in the last 315
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're happy about the shutouts, and hopefully, we
can continue it going into Chicago, but it's a strange feeling,''
said Revolution defender Mike Burns. ``It's good for our
confidence, but at the same time, the main objective was to make
the playoffs. We're on a streak lately, but we have no one to blame
but ourselves in not getting to the playoffs. Everything's been
overridden by not making it there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution are in their third year of existence but have
made the playoffs only once _ last season, and largely because of
Zenga's play as a goalkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's proving valuable as the coach, stressing defense, just
as he did on his teams in Italy, for whom he had 38 shutouts in 58
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter brought his experience from playing for Italy, and it
was world-renowned in playing the best defense in the world,'' said
Burns. ``And it's not just the goalkeeper and the back four
players, either, but everyone staying on the ball in presenting a
shutout opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution (11-19) have a chance to tie the league record of
four consecutive shutouts, set in 1996 by MetroStars goalkeeper
Tony Meola.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no pressure anymore,'' said Burns. ``We're laid-back,
but at the same time, we want to win. We're going to try to enjoy
the game. We're looking at next season, with the hope that it
bounces over.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the shutouts, against Columbus Sept. 12, Feuer didn't
even have to make a save.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great line _ a 2-0 win and no saves,'' said Feuer.
``I'll take that any time. We're looking to finish on a high. We're
going for two more clean sheets and two more wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's battling for each other. It's not that we're
working harder, but we've had some luck go our way and we're
organized, with players coming up with the big plays. Walter was
with us for only two days before we played Miami (a 3-2 loss Aug.
30), so he didn't know us that well. We didn't play that well in
the first half, but we've been fine ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were giving up a lot of goals in the beginning and the
middle of the season,'' said defender Brian Dunseth. ``Now we're
going for the zero every game. Right now we're worried about
playing defense first and our scoring chances come out of that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter's experienced in so many ways, and you have to believe
in him, you have to respect him for all the places he's played,''
said defender Ted Chronopoulos. ``You have to respect his
decisions. We're all 100 percent behind him and he's 100 percent
behind us. He's given us a new attitude.''

STUDY: CALIFORNIA PUMPS MORE INTO PRISONS AT EXPENSE OF EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VENISE WAGNER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The rate of state spending on California's
correctional system outpaced that of public universities in the
past decade, according to a report released Wednesday by a think
tank that studies criminal justice issues.
</P>
<P>
   Funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, the nonprofit,
nonpartisan, San Francisco-based Justice Policy Institute conducted
the study comparing state spending on prisons and higher education
from 1988 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   It found that while general-fund appropriations to corrections
rose 60 percent, appropriations for public colleges and
universities dropped 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   From 1993 to 1995, prison spending hit its peak _ consuming 8.7
percent of the general-fund budget, the report said. During the
same period, higher education reached an all-time low, accounting
for 12 percent of the general fund.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts at the Justice Policy Institute said they discovered a
near dollar-to-dollar correlation to the increase of spending on
corrections and the decrease in higher education.
</P>
<P>
   Current spending on higher education is about 13.2 percent of
the $57.3 billion general-fund budget, or $7.6 billion. About 7.8
percent of the state's general fund goes toward the prison system _
about $4.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The budget is the ultimate statement of priority,'' said Dan
Macallair, an institute analyst. ``When you decide to increase one
portion of the budget and decrease another, there is a
connection.''
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Schiraldi, director of the Justice Policy Institute,
said that since prisons and universities are both funded with
discretionary money from the general fund, they are constantly
competing for dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Schiraldi said they also were targeting the same age group and
``symbolize the state's plans and hopes for the future. Are we
going to educate or are we going to incarcerate? It's a hard
question that people have to pose now to the governor,
(gubernatorial candidates) and other officeholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Sean Walsh, a spokesman for Gov. Pete Wilson, called the
comparison of spending on corrections and higher education
ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so nonsensical ... you don't see a lot of kids going to
our higher ed institutions dropping out and going to prison,''
Walsh said. ``That's not where the prison population is coming
from. The real issue that apparently this group doesn't have the
courage to address is the fact that our K-12 system has failed far
too many children, particularly those in economically depressed and
crime-ridden areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They drop out in ninth or 10th grade because they have not
been prepared for school. We're investing literally billions of
dollars to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   While university administrators acknowledge that spending on
state colleges fell in the early 1990s, they contend state funding
is on the upswing, and not just because there was a $4 billion
budget surplus this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel optimistic in California that the governor and the
Legislature have gotten a wakeup call,'' said California State
University Chancellor Charles Reed. ``I sense a turnaround where
people realize California's future is going to be tied to its
higher-education system. There's a lot of work to do, a lot of
make-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Hershman, a vice president in the University of California
system, conceded that state universities have experienced budget
difficulties in the last decade, but expressed concern at the
report's methodology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little bothered by looking only at corrections and
higher education together,'' he said. ``You have to look at all of
(the budget), you can't just look at two categories, because when
the Legislature is looking at it they're looking at the whole
budget.''
</P>
<P>
   The report will be presented Saturday at a University of
California at Berkeley conference, ``Critical Resistance: Beyond
the Prison Industrial Complex.''

<P>
   With much trepidation, I have been tracking the fortunes of
Iridium, the ``world's first global, hand-held satellite phone.''
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't heard of it already, you soon will. The company
is spending $140 million in television and magazine advertising.
The TV ads feature panoramic vistas of faraway climes _ the very
backs of beyond you would visit just to avoid any mention of actor
Alec Baldwin, for instance _ interrupted by ... Alec Baldwin.
``Iridium is coming,'' Baldwin intones. ``It will send a dial tone
to every corner of planet Earth. And you won't have to be out of
touch.''
</P>
<P>
   This is my worst nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Happily for me, less happily for Iridium, the company's plans to
debut its service today have come a cropper. A couple of satellites
burned up, some software fritzed out. But it is only a matter of
time. New satellites will be launched. Twenty-three-year-olds from
Stanford will de-bug the software. Within two or three years,
Iridium will be just one of three cell phone companies that can
dial any phone number in the world, at any time of day or night.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there was evidence that modern times aren't for me, this
is it. What does everyone have to say to each other that's so
important, anyway? I have very little to say, and I devour about
1,600 words a week saying it. Would you like me to phone you, to
drive the point home?
</P>
<P>
   Why does everyone want to be in touch, instantly? I love being
out of touch. I still haven't read my Christmas cards from 1997.
Outside of my immediate family, there are about 13 people on the
planet I can stand (of course that includes you!) and during an
average year I see each one of them in person. Do I want them to
phone me from the Disney Store in Uttar Pradesh? No thanks.
</P>
<P>
   I receive all manner of calls from people on the go. Phoning
from a car always transmits that subtle message: You're not
important enough for me to call from a real phone. Eight times out
of 10, some miscreant is returning my call well after my deadline,
burbling furiously: ``You've got it all wrong, I never (STATIC) My
lawyer ... (STATIC) Wait, I'm going into a (END OF TRANSMISSION).''
</P>
<P>
   I object to all forms of mobile communications, with the
possible exception of nautical semaphore. To be fair, I have had
two positive experiences with wireless phones. My sons and I once
met a hiker atop Mount Israel in New Hampshire who let us call
home, collect. That was fun. And my brother-in-law, with whom I
share a macabre obsession with aircraft turbulence, once phoned me
from the business section of a flight over the Rockies to report:
``They're screaming in economy!'' The flight ended smoothly, thank
heavens.
</P>
<P>
   Do you remember when Charles Stuart tried to ``save'' his wife's
life by dialing 911 on his car phone in 1989? Suburban women
everywhere convinced their husbands they needed car phones to avoid
being brutally murdered by marauding bandits, like poor Carol
Stuart. We later learned that the true lesson of the Stuart killing
was not to acquire a car phone, but to ditch the homicidal husband.
Now every Jeep Cherokee in MetroWest is wired to update grocery
lists, 24/7 as it were. How extraordinarily useful.
</P>
<P>
   If I had my choice, we wouldn't even have a phone at home. Yes,
I'm unlisted, a cowardly overreaction to a windy threat many years
ago. When our home phone does ring, I have been known to answer
``Woof, woof,'' hoping that the caller might hang up. Instead, he
or she quickly deduces who I am and asks to speak with someone
other than the family sociopath.
</P>
<P>
   Call me a Luddite, call me a curmudgeon. Call me
uncommunicative. But best of all, don't call me at all.

`NEWSRADIO' BIDS CLUMSY FAREWELL TO HARTMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
NEWSRADIO 
Starring: Vicki Lewis, Khandi Alexander, Dave Foley, Andy Dick,
Maura Tierney, Joe Rogan, Stephen Root 
On: NBC 
Time: Wednesday night at 9:30

   &UR;  &LR; When McLean Stevenson left ``MASH'' in 1975, the show's
creative team was at a distinct advantage: Stevenson was alive.
This convenience enabled the writers to turn Lieutenant Colonel
Henry Blake's final episode into a beautifully choreographed series
of emotional farewells, capped by the devastating announcement that
his plane had been shot down over the Sea of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The makers of ``NewsRadio'' have been handed a far less
auspicious creative challenge this fall, as one of their leading
ensemble players, Phil Hartman, was killed in May by his wife, who
then killed herself. Tonight, the NBC sitcom must return for its
fifth season with both an explanation for the absence of Hartman's
character, Bill McNeal, and a script device that will provide
catharsis for Hartman's fellow cast members as well as for the
viewing audience. Not an easy task, especially within a sitcom
tradition whose most classic death episode _ ``Chuckles Bites the
Dust'' on ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' _ was a laugh riot notable
for its flaming insensitivity. ``MASH,'' after all, was set in the
middle of the Korean War and had the sort of flexibility to
accommodate tragedy not found in the fluffy likes of ``NewsRadio.''
</P>
<P>
   And so ``NewsRadio'' gets an A for effort and a C for execution
for ``Bill Moves On,'' its adieu to the egomaniancal Bill McNeal
before Jon Lovitz joins the cast next week as WNYX's insecure new
anchor. The episode tries hard to be amusing, as each of the radio
station employees has an fitting response to McNeal's demise, and
it provides one, maybe two tear-threatening moments. But otherwise,
it's a decidedly flat and unspirited half-hour of TV, possibly an
inadvertent reflection of real-life sadness for Hartman on the set
of the show. Sometimes grief inspires greatness, but, alas, not in
the case of tonight's ``NewsRadio.''
</P>
<P>
   The show opens after the funeral of McNeal, who has died of a
heart attack. The ensemble is praising Dave's
two-hour-and-17-minute eulogy, but behind his back they admit they
hated it. Meanwhile, ditzy Matthew is deep in denial, convinced
that Bill is actually still alive and doing something exotic like
starting a boat chartering company in Afghanistan. And Lisa admits
she went on a four-day drinking binge when she heard the news.
Later, each character reads aloud the personal notes that Bill left
in the event of his passing, including a few touching words to
Matthew and lewd comments to Lisa and Catherine. Former cast member
Khandi Alexander returns for a cameo as Catherine.
</P>
<P>
   (By the way: Hartman also needed to be written out of ``3d Rock
From the Sun,'' which returns tonight at 9 on Ch.7. In last
season's cliffhanger, he put in a guest appearance as Randy, the
nut who kidnapped Harry. The season's night's episode begins with
Harry having been sold to a circus by Randy, who is no longer in
the story line.)
</P>
<P>
   While ``NewsRadio'' has been a favorite of some critics over the
years, it has been only marginally popular with viewers. It was a
surprise when NBC announced the show's renewal for 13 episodes this
season, after its consistently mediocre performance in the ratings.
I have found the sitcom frustratingly uneven, a talented ensemble
of actors limited by repetitive, shallow material and
insufficiently defined comic targets. Dave Foley gives a subtle,
boyish edge to his character, and Andy Dick is an original physical
comic. And Phil Hartman brought plenty of verve to his version of
Ted Baxter, a leering, vain man who was as smart as he was stupid.
But this relentlessly broad character does not represent Hartman's
best work, which will inevitably be shown for years to come on the
many ``Saturday Night Live'' repeats.

CLINTON CRISIS HAS ITS ROOTS IN A JONES CASE RULING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER S. CANELLOS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just 17 months ago, the Supreme Court, saying the
Paula Jones case ``appears to us highly unlikely to occupy any
substantial amount'' of the president's time, unanimously brushed
aside the argument that a civil suit should be delayed until after
a president leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the country fixated on an impeachment report stemming
from Clinton's deposition in the Jones case, legal specialists are
wondering whether it was the Supreme Court's poor judgment,
Clinton's uniquely poor conduct _ or some toxic combination _ that
brought about a crisis that threatens the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few people would say, `If we had this to do over again,
we'd do it the same way,' '' said Gerard Lynch, a professor at
Columbia Law School. ``Wouldn't it have been much better for the
world if Paula Jones's lawsuit had waited until after he left
office?''
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil of the past nine months, he said, ``certainly shows
the court was wrong in its prediction of what would happen, and
that it was naive. I'd like to think it doesn't mean they were
wrong on the basic issues, though it's hard to defend at this
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees. Conservative legal scholars who otherwise
condemn the litigious nature of US society emphasize that Clinton's
problems were caused by Clinton _ not by the mere fact of a private
lawsuit being allowed to go forward during his term in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the Supreme Court didn't anticipate that the president
would lie under oath on a deposition,'' said Theodore B. Olson,
president of the Washington chapter of the Federalist Society, a
conservative legal group.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the question remains in many legal circles whether the
high court's decision has inaugurated a new era of presidential
litigation, in which critics of the president can finance lawsuits
based on his private conduct and then use the discovery powers to
embarrass or distract him.
</P>
<P>
   One conservative group alone, Judicial Watch, has filed 19
lawsuits against Clinton, involving both official and personal
conduct. And some legal specialists predict that the tactics used
by the conservative groups backing Paula Jones could be replicated
against future administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Past business deals, unpaid debts, aggreived ex-employees,
unsafe conditions on private property _ all could become fodder for
lawsuits against chief executives, following the logic of the
court's May 1997 decision in Clinton v. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how much one can generalize from this affair, but
maybe the landscape has changed,'' said Randall Kennedy, a
professor at Harvard Law School. ``Maybe this is the inauguration
of a new type of politics, of a group of people who use civil
litigation as a new political tool.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, ``I'm hesitant to generalize based on what's
happened in this one case.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Clinton, in his bile-filled, anger-laced testimony
before the grand jury, believed that the Jones case was a political
attack, not an attempt to resolve a legal dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious. . .that the Jones lawyers' strategy in this case
had nothing to do with uncovering or proving sexual harassment,''
Clinton testified. ``By the time this discovery started, they knew
they had a base case on the law. And they knew what our evidence
was _ they knew they had a lousy case on the facts. And so their
strategy, since they were being funded by my political opponents,
was to have this dragnet of discovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones's case, whatever its legal merits, was substantially aided
by conservative opponents of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Jones first appeared in public at a press conference organized
by longtime Clinton antagonists. Then, last year, her lawyers, who
were working on a standard contingency-fee arrangement, negotiated
a $700,000 settlement. Jones refused to accept it, demanding a more
detailed apology from Clinton. When the lawyers quit, saying Jones
was being unreasonable, the Rutherford Institute, a conservative
legal foundation, took over her representation.
</P>
<P>
   The president's defenders maintain that politics, at a minimum,
distorted the legal process. If Clinton were not president, and
Jones could not count on his political enemies to finance her
lawsuit, she would have been obliged either to accept the $700,000
settlement or to proceed without a lawyer, they said. Instead, the
Rutherford-funded lawyers pushed the case forward, obtained the
right to delve into Clinton's sexual history, and then peppered him
with leading questions.
</P>
<P>
   When evidence emerged that he had lied in his answers, an
independent counsel was already ramped up and ready to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, for one, believes the process could someday repeat
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we've learned is that in the ugly modern
political era, it's very easy to imagine politically funded,
politically inspired lawsuits,'' Lynch, a former federal
prosecutor, said. ``Then, if the president's version is on the
short end of the evidence, which someone's will be, why not crank
up a special prosecutor and you're off to the races?''
</P>
<P>
   But presidents, other legal specialists insist, should not have
trouble telling the truth, even in a political environment that is
humid with innuendo.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Smith, a Washington lawyer and former clerk for Supreme
Court Justice Clarence Thomas, insisted, ``If you conduct civil
litigation like it's supposed to be conducted, you get it thrown
out on the merits, not by giving false statements.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Had Clinton told the truth in his deposition,'' Smith noted,
``the case would have been thrown out and it certainly wouldn't
have been fodder for the spectacle we've seen over the past few
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson, of the Federalist Society, said he, too, finds that civil
litigation can be overbearing, but he believes that everyone should
suffer equally _ even the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The solution shouldn't be to make one person immune from the
system,'' he said. ``It should be to correct the system for
everyone.''

   WEST HORSLEY, England _ It is morning and the house hums with
the sounds of making ready for school.
</P>
<P>
   It's the familiar calamity of searching for a clean shirt,
digging through drawers for lunch money, forging a breakfast from
the odd piece of bread or banana and barking tired parental
commands -- ``Put on your socks, NOW!''
</P>
<P>
   The difference here is that my sons, their Southern accents and
American ways obvious to all, are preparing to go to English
schools.
</P>
<P>
   My big son, a 14-year-old who refers to himself as a ``troubled
genius,'' and my 4-year-old, who is given to asking strangers why
they are fat, wrinkled or bald, dress in their uniforms each
weekday and head off to schools where they are the only Americans.
</P>
<P>
   My big son wears the black-and-yellow striped tie of the
Sheridan House at the Howard of Effingham School. He seems
surprisingly mature in his black blazer and dark gray trousers. On
the first day of school, he wondered aloud if we weren't sending
him to undertaker academy.
</P>
<P>
   My small son wears dark gray shorts, gray knee socks, a white
golf shirt and a kelly green pullover with the deer insignia of the
Raleigh School.
</P>
<P>
   After years of debating with our big son the precise meaning of
words such as ``filthy,'' ``ripped'' and ``nerdy,'' it is
reassuring to see him dressed in a way that even I can comprehend.
And with my small son, it is comforting to see him dressed as the
other little ones, a harmony that suggests a feeling of belonging
in a still alien place.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, a recovering advertising professional, and I thought
that such an experience would be the main point in moving to
England. Yet, other Americans, many of whom send their children to
American schools with American kids, seem shocked by our decision.
At a meeting of a book club of American women the other day, gazes
of incredulity fell upon my wife when she let slip that our sons
are in English schools. One woman even asked if we weren't worried
about the damage we were doing our sons.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, it is a complex proposition. The curriculum doesn't
translate directly, and there is a decided difference in approach
here. One headmaster described it this way: English schools provide
skills; American schools provide reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, we even detected a subtle prejudice here against
American schools. During pre-admission interviews, administrators
often would reassure us, at times in vaguely patronizing tones,
that they understood the ``special'' needs of American kids in
science and math. One school wanted our big son to start class with
younger kids.
</P>
<P>
   He wisely revolted against this idea and chose a school where he
was offered a place with kids his age. He now scoffs at the math
and can almost understand the science. So there!
</P>
<P>
   Among their classmates, both boys are novelties. On his first
day, my small son was confronted by bigger boys who proclaimed a
dislike for Americans because his father had told him that we are
evil gun toters. My big son has been questioned about such topics
as the alarming surplus of fat people in America. Occasionally,
there is the thing about language: they laugh at my son's calling
the ``pavement,'' ``sidewalks'' and ``bum bags,'' ``fanny packs.''
He has taken a fancy to using the word ``fancy,'' and uses the word
``soccer'' only in the privacy of home.
</P>
<P>
   For all the difficulties, the boys seem to be thriving. And,
perhaps most importantly, in learning so much about other people,
they are learning a great deal more about themselves.

   My big son wears the black-and-yellow striped tie of the
Sheridan House at the Howard of Effingham School. He seems
surprisingly mature in his black blazer and dark gray trousers. On
the first day of school, he wondered aloud if we weren't sending
him to undertaker academy.
</P>
<P>
   My small son wears dark gray shorts, gray knee socks, a white
golf shirt and a kelly green pullover with the deer insignia of the
Raleigh School.
</P>
<P>
   After years of debating with our big son the precise meaning of
words such as ``filthy,'' ``ripped'' and ``nerdy,'' it is
reassuring to see him dressed in a way that even I can comprehend.
And with my small son, it is comforting to see him dressed as the
other little ones, a harmony that suggests a feeling of belonging
in a still alien place.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, a recovering advertising professional, and I thought
that such an experience would be the main point in moving to
England. Yet, other Americans, many of whom send their children to
American schools with American kids, seem shocked by our decision.
At a meeting of a book club of American women the other day, gazes
of incredulity fell upon my wife when she let slip that our sons
are in English schools. One woman even asked if we weren't worried
about the damage we were doing our sons.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, it is a complex proposition. The curriculum doesn't
translate directly, and there is a decided difference in approach
here. One headmaster described it this way: English schools provide
skills; American schools provide reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, we even detected a subtle prejudice here against
American schools. During pre-admission interviews, administrators
often would reassure us, at times in vaguely patronizing tones,
that they understood the ``special'' needs of American kids in
science and math. One school wanted our big son to start class with
younger kids.
</P>
<P>
   He wisely revolted against this idea and chose a school where he
was offered a place with kids his age. He now scoffs at the math
and can almost understand the science. So there!
</P>
<P>
   Among their classmates, both boys are novelties. On his first
day, my small son was confronted by bigger boys who proclaimed a
dislike for Americans because his father had told him that we are
evil gun toters. My big son has been questioned about such topics
as the alarming surplus of fat people in America. Occasionally,
there is the thing about language: they laugh at my son's calling
the ``pavement,'' ``sidewalks'' and ``bum bags,'' ``fanny packs.''
He has taken a fancy to using the word ``fancy,'' and uses the word
``soccer'' only in the privacy of home.
</P>
<P>
   For all the difficulties, the boys seem to be thriving. And,
perhaps most importantly, in learning so much about other people,
they are learning a great deal more about themselves.

JUDGE DISMISSES PORTION OF INTERNET COPYRIGHT SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SETH ROSENFELD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A federal judge in Los Angeles has dismissed a
copyright lawsuit filed by a photographer who contended that one of
his photos was improperly used on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Manuel Real on Monday dismissed Gary
Bernstein's lawsuit against Elizabeth Arden Inc., the maker of
Passion perfume.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein claimed that Arden was liable because a J.C. Penney
Internet site that promoted the perfume had a link to a separate
Web site about movie stars, which in turn had a link to a third
site in Sweden that displayed _ without his permission _ his
photograph of Elizabeth Taylor, the spokeswoman for the perfume.
</P>
<P>
   Since Arden acted alone in seeking the dismissal, J.C. Penney
remains a defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Observers said it was the first case to claim a copyright
violation based on multiple Internet links. Viewers click on links,
the highlighted words or icons on Web pages, to move from one site
to another.
</P>
<P>
   Several experts said the lawsuit threatened the way the Web
works, because it presented Web-site operators with the daunting
prospect of screening sites they were linked.
</P>
<P>
   The Beverly Hills photographer claimed that Arden and J.C.
Penney Co. Inc. had violated his copyright. Copyright law prohibits
copying or distributing someone else's creative expression without
his or her permission. Copyright infringements can lead to
injunctions and orders to pay damages.
</P>
<P>
   Arden countered that it had no control over the J.C. Penney Web
site and, even if it did, was not responsible for photos shown on a
site three links away.
</P>
<P>
   Upholding a theory that it was liable for the content of other
Web sites ``would bring traffic on the Information Highway to a
standstill,'' said a brief filed by Arden's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein countered that the case was not about the obligation
to screen ``the entire (Web) for infringing sites.'' He claimed
that Arden and J.C. Penney had designed the Penney Web site to link
to his photo to avoid paying him fees, which Arden denied.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Craft, a Los Angeles lawyer representing J.C. Penney,
said his client would seek a settlement with Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Grannan, Bernstein's lawyer, could not be reached for
comment, and it was unknown whether his client would appeal the
judge's decision.

   CLINTON-LEGAL-THINKING (Washington) _ In the Watergate era, the
misdeeds of lawyers provoked a national discussion about whether
``legal ethics'' was an oxymoron. In recent days, President
Clinton's troubles have spurred a new and broader debate about the
role of lawyers in American society. This time, the issue is not
whether they broke any laws but whether lawyers and their way of
thinking have become so pervasive in America that legalistic
gamesmanship is dominating politics _ and, perhaps, everyday life.

 By RICK MASHBURN 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The Blue Ridge Parkway, a 469-mile Federal scenic highway
running between the Shenandoah National Park in Virginia and the
Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina, skirts the
eastern side of Asheville, N.C., for about 12 miles. But all signs
of the city's commerce and industry are obscured by hills and by
walls of rhododendron bushes.
 &HT;    Distracted drivers _ those with their eyes on autumn leaves, for
instance _ can easily pass the five Asheville exits without
realizing they have missed the largest city in western North
Carolina.
 &HT;    Asheville is particularly appealing in the fall, since it is
surrounded by some of the highest mountains in the eastern United
States, like the 6,684-foot Mount Mitchell, and is just minutes
away from protected wilderness areas and whitewater rivers. In
contrast, there is the Biltmore Estate, a 255-room mansion in the
style of a French chateau.
 &HT;    Asheville, population 67,000, is about 85 miles from the
southern end of the parkway. It makes a good stop for leaf watchers
who need replenishing, or a convenient base camp.
 &HT;    The downtown section, largely neglected for decades, is
undergoing a renaissance. The area has exceptional (and eccentric)
architecture, including Art Deco and Gothic Revival, and in the
past three years more than 20 buildings have been restored or
renovated. Once-empty storefronts house galleries with art,
antiques and the crafts of the region.
 &HT;    In the evenings, sidewalks fill with a mix of skateboarders and
window shoppers. You can hear blues on one side of the street and
bluegrass on the other.
 &HT;    More than a dozen downtown restaurants offer some form of
outdoor dining, including four side by side on Pack Square, three
of them so close that diners can pass a salt shaker from one
restaurant to the next.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    The turning of the leaves begins with the red blush of dogwoods
and concludes with the russet tones of oaks. In late September
visitors will want to seek out higher elevations; those traveling
in early November should stick to valleys and lowlands. Foliage
conditions: (800) 280-0005.
 &HT;    Leaf watchers are not the only creatures flocking in. On clear
days thousands of migrating hawks have been seen following air
currents along the mountain ridges.
 &HT;    The privately owned Chimney Rock Park, 25 miles southeast of
Asheville on Highway 74A, will hold a hawk watch on Sept. 20. From
a rocky perch 1,200 feet above the valley floor, participants will
look for broad-winged, sharp-shinned and cooper's hawks.
 &HT;    An ornithologist will identify less frequent migrants: ospreys,
falcons and the occasional eagle. Admission to the park, $9.95 ($5
for children aged 6 to 16), includes an elevator ride to a gift
shop and a 75-mile view. It can be crowded at the top. Information:
(800) 277-9611.
 &HT;    A simple wooden folk toy is the center of attention at the 18th
annual Gee Haw Whimmy Diddle World Competition, Sept. 19 at the
Folk Art Center, mile 382 on the Blue Ridge Parkway (measured from
the northern end) just north of town.
 &HT;    A whimmy diddle consists of two sticks, one with a propeller
attached to one end, and the trick is to make the propeller spin by
rubbing one stick against the other.
 &HT;    Such traditional crafts as soap carving, blacksmithing and
basket weaving will be demonstrated on the grounds of the center,
which offers exhibits and a sales gallery year round. Free
admission; information, (828) 298-7928.
 &HT;    Handicrafts both homespun and sophisticated will be sold at the
Southern Highland Craft Guild Fair, Oct. 15 to 18 at Asheville
Civic Center, 87 Haywood Street. About 150 crafts experts will
participate, all members of the guild, which was established in
1928 and also operates the Folk Art Center. Tickets are $5;
information, (828) 298-7928.
 &HT;    ``In the City: Urban Vision 1900-1940,'' is an exhibition of 55
paintings by such artists as Edward Hopper, Reginald Marsh and John
Sloan. The pictures are on display through Oct. 31 at the Asheville
Art Museum in Pack Place, 2 Pack Square, and are on loan from the
Whitney Museum of American Art. Admission, $5; information, (828)
253-3227.
 &HT;    The work of the city's own artists can be viewed during the City
Center Arts Walk, which is held every other month, the next one on
the evening of Nov. 6. Twenty-four downtown galleries and studios
will be open for crowds who come for the art, the street performers
and the festive atmosphere. Free; information, (828) 258-0710.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The Blue Ridge Parkway has unblemished views of valleys and
ridges and provides frequent overlooks. Between miles 363 and 369,
about 25 miles north of
 &HT;    Asheville, Craggy Gardens offers trails and picnic areas.
Another eight miles north is the entrance to Mount Mitchell State
Park, where visitors can climb a stone tower to admire a stunning
360-degree view.
 &HT;    When a new road opens on Oct. 24, parkway travelers will have
direct access to the North Carolina Arboretum at mile 393 just
south of Asheville. For now, drivers must follow signs from State
Route 191.
 &HT;    The arboretum showcases native flora in informal plantings and
distinctive theme gardens. Free; grounds open daily from 8 a.m. to
9 p.m. Information, (828) 665-2492.
 &HT;    Cold Mountain is attracting increased attention after giving its
name to Charles Frazier's best-selling novel of Civil War days.
Visible from the overlook near parkway mile 412, the peak is strong
but hardly spectacular, especially when compared with Looking Glass
Rock, the dramatic granite dome that comes into view from the
parkway a few miles farther south.
 &HT;    Asheville's best-known literary landmark, Thomas Wolfe's boyhood
home, was badly damaged in a fire on July 24 and is expected to be
closed for several years. The site's new visitors center, at 52
Market St., remains open and is well worth a trip, with its
well-designed displays, among them the contents of Wolfe's last New
York apartment. Admission is free; open Monday to Saturday, 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m.; Sunday 1 to 5. Information, (828) 253-8304.
 &HT;    F. Scott Fitzgerald visited the city frequently during the
1930's and always stayed in Room 441 of the Grove Park Inn. He
liked the room because it overlooked the courtyard and he preferred
observing people to mountains.
 &HT;    This year the hotel restored the room to look as it did during
his visits, outfitting it with vintage telephone and radio and
Fitzgerald memorablilia. The room can be viewed when unoccupied, or
you can stay there yourself for $185 for two, $195 on weekends.
 &HT;    A thorough tour of the Biltmore estate, (800) 543-2961, with its
chateau, winery and 75 acres of gardens, can take the better part
of a day, yet it is not easy to leave anything out.
 &HT;    The basement, which is a recreation area with two bowling alleys
and a swimming pool, is as fascinating to some as the main floors,
where spacious rooms house fine furniture, paintings, 16th-century
tapestries, and carvings in stone and wood.
 &HT;    Admission is $29.95 a person ($22.50 for children aged 10 to 15;
free for 9 and under). The estate is open daily, the house from 9
a.m. to 6 p.m., the grounds from 8:30 a.m. to dusk, and the winery
from 11 to 7. All are likely to be busy on weekends, and almost
certainly during leaf season, particularly in October.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Beds are at a premium during leaf season, especially on
weekends; reservations are essential. Prices do not include a 9
percent tax.
 &HT;    The shady and historic Montford Park neighborhood, just north of
downtown, has a dozen bed-and-breakfast inns within a six-block
area. Most are in fine old houses, and many have pleasant gardens.
 &HT;    The Lion and the Rose, 276 Montford Ave., (828) 255-7673, fax
(828) 285-9810, dates back to 1895. This neoclassical house has
four guest rooms and one suite, all furnished with antiques and
queen-size beds. A room for two ranges from $115 to $165; the
suite, $195.
 &HT;    The Radisson Hotel, 1 Thomas Wolfe Plaza, (800) 438-3960, fax
(828) 254-1374, is in the heart of downtown. Its 12 stories of
glass and steel do not add character to the city, but the 281 rooms
are comfortable, and some have a view of the mountains. A double is
$99 to $149.
 &HT;    Budget: Many of the city's less expensive hotels and motels can
be found on busy Tunnel Road. Days Inn Central, 199 Tunnel Road,
(828) 254-4311, fax (704) 258-3970, is near the Asheville Mall, the
city's biggest shopping center. The inn has 77 rooms; doubles are
$59 to $79.
 &HT;    Luxury: Richmond Hill Inn, 87 Richmond Hill Drive; (888)
742-4540, fax (828) 252-8726, started out with rooms in a mansion
built in 1889. The inn has been expanded with nine one-room
cottages built around a croquet green, and the newest addition (in
1996), the garden pavilion, with guest rooms and a restaurant for
groups. There are 36 rooms and suites in all, many with fireplaces.
Most, particularly in the main house, are furnished in Victorian
style. Rates for a double room, $135 to $375, include a full
breakfast and afternoon tea.
 &HT;    Grove Park Inn, 290 Macon Ave., (800) 438-5800, fax (828)
252-6102, has also grown considerably over the years. With two
modern wings, it now has 510 rooms and is a resort with golf, a
comprehensive sports facility, three restaurants and a nightclub.
The rooms are furnished in the Arts and Crafts style that evolved
from the turn of the century to the 1920s. Doubles: $185 to $235.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    At the Market Place, 20 Wall St., (828) 252-4162, fall brings
apples, one of the chef's favorite foods. They turn up in soups,
salads, and desserts and in such entrees as trout stuffed with
apple and bacon, and salmon with a red onion and apple crust. The
decor, which is contemporary, includes stainless steel and marble
walls. Dinner for two, with a modest wine, is about $90, not
including tax and tip.
 &HT;    La Caterina Trattoria, 5 Pack Square, (828) 254-1148, has the
feel and the flavors of Italy. It's in a building that is more than
100 years old and has high ceilings plastered with posters, and
small white tiles on floor and walls. Sausages, some pastas and the
mozzarella are made on the premises. Osso buco and braciole are
among the entrees. Outdoor and indoor dining. Dinner for two with
wine is about $75.
 &HT;    The Laughing Seed Cafe, 40 Wall St., (828) 252-3445, has an
eclectic look with a fantasy Caribbean mural stretching the length
of one wall, as well as local quilts. It offers satisfying
vegetarian variations of such traditional foods as the sloppy Joe,
Reuben sandwich and New Orleans muffaletta. Dinner specialties
include Thai green curry and pesto penne primavera. Dinner for two
with beer from the microbrewery in the basement is about $30.
 &HT;    ``Colorful'' does not adequately describe Salsas, 6 Patton
Avenue, (828) 252-9805, a tiny place with Day-Glo decor and wild
Mexican and Caribbean cuisine. One salsa is made with smoked ancho
chiles, cinnamon and charred tomatillos; another has mango, carrot
and habanero pepper. Improbable combinations _ a taco with smoked
trout, eggplant and plantain _ usually manage to please. Always
jammed, but that is part of the fun. Dinner for two, with beer, is
about $25.

 &HT;    
 By RICK MASHBURN 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The Blue Ridge Parkway, a 469-mile Federal scenic highway
running between the Shenandoah National Park in Virginia and the
Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina, skirts the
eastern side of Asheville, N.C., for about 12 miles. But all signs
of the city's commerce and industry are obscured by hills and by
walls of rhododendron bushes.
 &HT;    Distracted drivers _ those with their eyes on autumn leaves, for
instance _ can easily pass the five Asheville exits without
realizing they have missed the largest city in western North
Carolina.
 &HT;    Asheville is particularly appealing in the fall, since it is
surrounded by some of the highest mountains in the eastern United
States, like the 6,684-foot Mount Mitchell, and is just minutes
away from protected wilderness areas and whitewater rivers. In
contrast, there is the Biltmore Estate, a 255-room mansion in the
style of a French chateau.
 &HT;    Asheville, population 67,000, is about 85 miles from the
southern end of the parkway. It makes a good stop for leaf watchers
who need replenishing, or a convenient base camp.
 &HT;    The downtown section, largely neglected for decades, is
undergoing a renaissance. The area has exceptional (and eccentric)
architecture, including Art Deco and Gothic Revival, and in the
past three years more than 20 buildings have been restored or
renovated. Once-empty storefronts house galleries with art,
antiques and the crafts of the region.
 &HT;    In the evenings, sidewalks fill with a mix of skateboarders and
window shoppers. You can hear blues on one side of the street and
bluegrass on the other.
 &HT;    More than a dozen downtown restaurants offer some form of
outdoor dining, including four side by side on Pack Square, three
of them so close that diners can pass a salt shaker from one
restaurant to the next.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    The turning of the leaves begins with the red blush of dogwoods
and concludes with the russet tones of oaks. In late September
visitors will want to seek out higher elevations; those traveling
in early November should stick to valleys and lowlands. Foliage
conditions: (800) 280-0005.
 &HT;    Leaf watchers are not the only creatures flocking in. On clear
days thousands of migrating hawks have been seen following air
currents along the mountain ridges.
 &HT;    The privately owned Chimney Rock Park, 25 miles southeast of
Asheville on Highway 74A, will hold a hawk watch on Sept. 20. From
a rocky perch 1,200 feet above the valley floor, participants will
look for broad-winged, sharp-shinned and cooper's hawks.
 &HT;    An ornithologist will identify less frequent migrants: ospreys,
falcons and the occasional eagle. Admission to the park, $9.95 ($5
for children aged 6 to 16), includes an elevator ride to a gift
shop and a 75-mile view. It can be crowded at the top. Information:
(800) 277-9611.
 &HT;    A simple wooden folk toy is the center of attention at the 18th
annual Gee Haw Whimmy Diddle World Competition, Sept. 19 at the
Folk Art Center, mile 382 on the Blue Ridge Parkway (measured from
the northern end) just north of town.
 &HT;    A whimmy diddle consists of two sticks, one with a propeller
attached to one end, and the trick is to make the propeller spin by
rubbing one stick against the other.
 &HT;    Such traditional crafts as soap carving, blacksmithing and
basket weaving will be demonstrated on the grounds of the center,
which offers exhibits and a sales gallery year round. Free
admission; information, (828) 298-7928.
 &HT;    Handicrafts both homespun and sophisticated will be sold at the
Southern Highland Craft Guild Fair, Oct. 15 to 18 at Asheville
Civic Center, 87 Haywood Street. About 150 crafts experts will
participate, all members of the guild, which was established in
1928 and also operates the Folk Art Center. Tickets are $5;
information, (828) 298-7928.
 &HT;    ``In the City: Urban Vision 1900-1940,'' is an exhibition of 55
paintings by such artists as Edward Hopper, Reginald Marsh and John
Sloan. The pictures are on display through Oct. 31 at the Asheville
Art Museum in Pack Place, 2 Pack Square, and are on loan from the
Whitney Museum of American Art. Admission, $5; information, (828)
253-3227.
 &HT;    The work of the city's own artists can be viewed during the City
Center Arts Walk, which is held every other month, the next one on
the evening of Nov. 6. Twenty-four downtown galleries and studios
will be open for crowds who come for the art, the street performers
and the festive atmosphere. Free; information, (828) 258-0710.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The Blue Ridge Parkway has unblemished views of valleys and
ridges and provides frequent overlooks. Between miles 363 and 369,
about 25 miles north of
 &HT;    Asheville, Craggy Gardens offers trails and picnic areas.
Another eight miles north is the entrance to Mount Mitchell State
Park, where visitors can climb a stone tower to admire a stunning
360-degree view.
 &HT;    When a new road opens on Oct. 24, parkway travelers will have
direct access to the North Carolina Arboretum at mile 393 just
south of Asheville. For now, drivers must follow signs from State
Route 191.
 &HT;    The arboretum showcases native flora in informal plantings and
distinctive theme gardens. Free; grounds open daily from 8 a.m. to
9 p.m. Information, (828) 665-2492.
 &HT;    Cold Mountain is attracting increased attention after giving its
name to Charles Frazier's best-selling novel of Civil War days.
Visible from the overlook near parkway mile 412, the peak is strong
but hardly spectacular, especially when compared with Looking Glass
Rock, the dramatic granite dome that comes into view from the
parkway a few miles farther south.
 &HT;    Asheville's best-known literary landmark, Thomas Wolfe's boyhood
home, was badly damaged in a fire on July 24 and is expected to be
closed for several years. The site's new visitors center, at 52
Market St., remains open and is well worth a trip, with its
well-designed displays, among them the contents of Wolfe's last New
York apartment. Admission is free; open Monday to Saturday, 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m.; Sunday 1 to 5. Information, (828) 253-8304.
 &HT;    F. Scott Fitzgerald visited the city frequently during the
1930's and always stayed in Room 441 of the Grove Park Inn. He
liked the room because it overlooked the courtyard and he preferred

of a day, yet it is not easy to leave anything out.

(828) 254-4311, fax (704) 258-3970, is near the Asheville Mall, the

252-6102, has also grown considerably over the years. With two

The rooms are furnished in the Arts and Crafts style that evolved
from the turn of the century to the 1920s. Doubles: $185 to $235.

 (PLEASE NOTE: This article has been transmitted twice _ into the

 &HT;    
 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    On the second day of their cruise-tour through Alaska, Robert F.
Reiland rushed his wife who was suffering from a life-threatening
breathing problem to a hospital emergency room in Fairbanks.
 &HT;    After four days of intensive care, Mrs. Reiland had recovered
enough to return home to Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., ending the
couple's journey. At the time they wrote us, they had received no
refunds for the portion of the trip that had to be cancelled, for
hotel bills in Fairbanks and for extra airfare _ not a penny from
the tour operator, their travel agent or the airline.
 &HT;    As Reiland says, ``We paid $11,000 up front for what became only
a round-trip to Alaska and a riverboat ride ...''
 &HT;    The truth is that the Reilands hadn't bought trip insurance. In
fact, they didn't even know such a thing existed. And, apparently,
their travel agent didn't tell them, either. As a result, nobody
was required to refund the Reilands' money.
 &HT;    With more mature travelers taking longer and more expensive
vacations, trip insurance is becoming a necessity to protect a
fairly large travel investment _ and it provides peace of mind.
 &HT;    A typical policy costs only 5 percent to 6 percent of the cost
of the trip; some policies cost less. Rates seem to be lower than
they were several years ago, and coverages are better as insurance
vendors expand their claims experience.
 &HT;    On the downside, leading trip-insurance sellers are beginning to
charge rates based on age _ the older you are, the more trip
insurance costs. The higher cost is also a result of the greater
number of claims filed by mature travelers, who have more
experience travelling.
 &HT;    For example, a policy from CSA Travel Protection will insure a
$2,500 trip for a premium of $69 if you are under 55, $105 if you
are 56 to 70, and $135 if you are 70 or older. Even so, those
premiums are a bargain compared with the costs of travel that
aren't reimbursed.
 COVERING THE BIG COSTS  
 &HT;    Make sure you are covered for loses you can't afford to absorb,
and try not to pay high prices for other frills. Make sure, too,
that the policy you choose is an insurance policy and not just an
add-on to a trip offered as an afterthought.
 &HT;    Nancy Hoyt Belcher of Oakland, Calif., was on a trip to Alaska's
Denali Wilderness Retreat on a remote back corner of the national
park, a place where there are no roads, when she suffered a heart
attack. Bad weather prevented a plane from getting in, so she was
helicoptered to the nearest hospital in Fairbanks.
 &HT;    But Fairbanks had no cardiology unit, so she was airlifted to
Anchorage, where she recuperated. Belcher says the bill for that
relatively short evacuation was more than $9,000. Some evacuations
from remote corners of the world to decent hospitals can cost up to
$25,000.
 &HT;    Your insurance policy should cover the following:
 &HT;     _ TRIP CANCELLATION OR INTERRUPTION: This is the primary reason
for all trip-insurance policies. It comes into play when: the death
or serious illness of you, your traveling companion or a close
relative at home requires you to cancel your trip and to stay home;
you have an emergency at home, like a flood or an earthquake; you
miss connections and can't pick up the trip; the ship is disabled
on a cruise the week before yours; your cruise is cancelled; and
your tour operator goes broke and you are stranded overseas.
 &HT;    Insurance reimbursement should cover the cruise fare or cost of
a tour that won't be refunded, any extra meals or lodging bills and
any airfare add-ons to fly home early.
 &HT;     _ EVACUATION:  Emergency medical evacuation insurance (EME) is
also a feature of most trip-insurance policies. Claim it when you
have an illness too serious to be treated on the spot and you must
be airlifted from some remote location to a hospital where you can
get proper care, or you need additional evacuation to a hospital
near your home.
 &HT;    Although evacuation is rarely necessary, it is about the most
expensive thing that can go wrong on a trip _ up to $25,000 for a
long-distance airlift. Clearly, this is an expense most travelers
can't absorb.
 &HT;     _ MEDICAL EXPENSES:  While extra medical or dental expenses may
be covered by your existing health-insurance policies, you should
check your policy to make sure you're covered outside the United
States.
 &HT;    If you've purchased Part B coverage, Medicare will probably
cover expensive options such as medical evacuation under its
provisions for ambulance services _ but only in the United States.
 &HT;    Beware: Medicare does not cover most health-threatening
situations that happen to you outside the country. So you'll need
this supplemental medical/dental coverage when you're traveling
abroad.
 &HT;     _ EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE: Does the policy provide medical
referral to English-speaking doctors overseas (preferably using a
telephone hotline), translation by phone, medical monitoring in a
foreign hospital, prescription help, emergency cash to pay foreign
hospital bills and possible legal assistance?
 &HT;    What you don't need in a trip-insurance policy are items often
already covered by your existing policies or those whose cost you
can handle: for example, coverage for lost or delayed luggage, lost
passports or travelers checks, accidental death or dismemberment,
accident insurance on a rental car.
 &HT;    And make sure you read your policy when you receive it and
understand your coverage. You may want to shop further.
 &HT;    Here are leading companies that provide trip insurance for
mature travelers. All basic policies from these companies provide
coverage for trip cancellation, medical evacuation, extra medical
costs and emergency services:
 &HT;     _ Access America,  (800) 284-8300.
 &HT;     _ American Express,  (800) 758-2639.
 &HT;     _ Berkeley Carefree,  (800) 323-3149.
 &HT;     _ CSA,  (800)348-9505.
 &HT;     _ TravelGuard,  (800) 826-1300.
 &HT;     _ Travelers,  (800) 243-3174.
 &HT;    Of these, ``Consumer Reports Travel Letter'' rated CSA and
Access America policies as best values.
 &HT;    Buy a trip-insurance policy from your travel agent at the time
you book the trip _ most agencies can set you up with these
companies _ or directly from the insurance provider.

 &HT;    
 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    On the second day of their cruise-tour through Alaska, Robert F.
Reiland rushed his wife who was suffering from a life-threatening
breathing problem to a hospital emergency room in Fairbanks.
 &HT;    After four days of intensive care, Mrs. Reiland had recovered
enough to return home to Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., ending the
couple's journey. At the time they wrote us, they had received no
refunds for the portion of the trip that had to be cancelled, for
hotel bills in Fairbanks and for extra airfare _ not a penny from
the tour operator, their travel agent or the airline.
 &HT;    As Reiland says, ``We paid $11,000 up front for what became only
a round-trip to Alaska and a riverboat ride ...''
 &HT;    The truth is that the Reilands hadn't bought trip insurance. In
fact, they didn't even know such a thing existed. And, apparently,
their travel agent didn't tell them, either. As a result, nobody
was required to refund the Reilands' money.
 &HT;    With more mature travelers taking longer and more expensive
vacations, trip insurance is becoming a necessity to protect a
fairly large travel investment _ and it provides peace of mind.
 &HT;    A typical policy costs only 5 percent to 6 percent of the cost
of the trip; some policies cost less. Rates seem to be lower than
they were several years ago, and coverages are better as insurance
vendors expand their claims experience.
 &HT;    On the downside, leading trip-insurance sellers are beginning to
charge rates based on age _ the older you are, the more trip
insurance costs. The higher cost is also a result of the greater
number of claims filed by mature travelers, who have more
experience travelling.
 &HT;    For example, a policy from CSA Travel Protection will insure a
$2,500 trip for a premium of $69 if you are under 55, $105 if you
are 56 to 70, and $135 if you are 70 or older. Even so, those
premiums are a bargain compared with the costs of travel that
aren't reimbursed.
 COVERING THE BIG COSTS  
 &HT;    Make sure you are covered for loses you can't afford to absorb,
and try not to pay high prices for other frills. Make sure, too,
that the policy you choose is an insurance policy and not just an
add-on to a trip offered as an afterthought.
 &HT;    Nancy Hoyt Belcher of Oakland, Calif., was on a trip to Alaska's
Denali Wilderness Retreat on a remote back corner of the national
park, a place where there are no roads, when she suffered a heart
attack. Bad weather prevented a plane from getting in, so she was
helicoptered to the nearest hospital in Fairbanks.
 &HT;    But Fairbanks had no cardiology unit, so she was airlifted to
Anchorage, where she recuperated. Belcher says the bill for that
relatively short evacuation was more than $9,000. Some evacuations
from remote corners of the world to decent hospitals can cost up to
$25,000.

 &HT;    
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The British Royal Family has made its share of gaffes and has
taken its share of knocks in recent years, most memorably when
Diana, Princess of Wales, died last August. So it's refreshing to
take note of one member of the extended Royal Family who's making a
good name for himself _ and his country in the process.
 &HT;    ``I'm very fortunate to be related to certain people'' James
Ogilvy says with characteristic modesty. Ogilvy is the 34-year-old
publisher and editor of the recently launched newsletter,
``Ogilvy's Britain and Ireland: The Insider Guide for the
Sophisticated Traveller.''
 &HT;    He also happens to be the son of H.R.H. Princess Alexandra, the
Hon. Lady Ogilvy, herself a first cousin to H.M. Queen Elizabeth
II. That makes James Ogilvy the 30th in line for the crown. He's
hardly up there with Prince William and Prince Harry, but he's a
Royal nonetheless.
 &HT;    Unlike some of his splashier relatives, Ogilvy lives out of the
spotlight in a small Scottish village not far from St. Andrews,
with his wife Julia and their children, Julia and James. It's a
quiet life but noteworthy enough to make the cover of Town &AMP;
Country in August 1997.
 &HT;    But for fans of Britain and Ireland, what's more important is
that Ogilvy has poured his love for his homeland and his expertise
in the luxury-goods field into this newsletter.
 &HT;    ``I've always been interested in newsletters, which are almost
completely unknown in Europe but big in the United States,'' Ogilvy
says from his 18th-century house with a view of the sea. ``But I
had never come across a newsletter about Britain, which I think is
a big omission.''
 &HT;    Especially given the fact that the British Tourist Authority is
projecting that a record 3.8 million Americans will go to Britain
this year.
 &HT;    Thankfully, Ogilvy already has a track record in the publishing
business. After spending four years as an investment banker and
then four years directing a shipping company, the MBA-wielding
Royal launched ``Luxury Briefing'' in October 1996.
 &HT;    This 16-page trade publication focuses on key events in the
luxury industry throughout the United States and Britain. Now it's
``Ogilvy's Britain and Ireland,'' which is squarely aimed at
affluent Americans.
 &HT;    ``We have something to say,'' Ogilvy explains. ``There's a lot
of information that we already had. We're quite well plugged in.''
 &HT;    The 12-page newsletter, now in its second issue, is as crisp and
well-organized as a good travel magazine. Each issue highlights
three London hotel properties.
 &HT;    In the first issue, properties such as The Hyde Park, The
Athenaeum and the Covent Garden Hotel are singled out.
 &HT;    Each issue also talks about hotels outside London, such as The
Clarence in Dublin and Chewton Glen in Hampshire. There are
features on London's hottest restaurants, on restaurants outside
London and on London shopping districts such as Westbourne Village.
 &HT;    There's also a feature on golf in each issue and a piece on
``Great British Institutions.'' In the first issue, it's about tea.
In the second, it's on bespoke tailoring.
 &HT;    What's best about it, perhaps, is the added attention to detail
_ to driving directions, airport, theater and museum information,
and even VAT refunds.
 &HT;    This is not for would-be Royals heading to Buckingham Palace.
It's for Anglophiles eager for insider news about where to eat, to
shop and to lay their heads at night. The prose is breezy, bright
and friendly, fitting for a newsletter for enthusiasts about all
things British, with a discrete nod to the Irish.
 &HT;    ``I think that as long as you're honest about a place, you can
lay it out for someone else to make their judgement,'' Ogilvy says.
 &HT;    An American enthusiast, he'd just returned from a two-week
summer vacation on the island of Nantucket.
 &HT;    ``I absolutely adore America,'' he says. ``I've got a lot of
very good American friends and I think I understand what Americans
enjoy. Unlike France or Italy or Spain, which are in or out of
fashion, Britain has a peculiar ongoing relationship with the
United States. So many Americans have links back here.''
 &HT;    The newsletter, which is priced at $100 a year, is a product
that Ogilvy hopes will have ``a clublike feel. I think someone like
Andrew Harper of 'The Hideaway Report' has done a tremendous job,
and I'd be very happy if we could emulate some of his success.''
 &HT;    Throughout the newsletter are ``Best-Kept Secrets'' such as
Cliveden Town House hotel in London and the Nefyn and District Golf
Club in Wales.
 &HT;    Does being a Royal give Ogilvy's newsletter special insight?
 &HT;    ``It doesn't necessarily give a particular slant to it,'' he
says. ``But I hope that my own experience and my own exposure to a
lot of the business we're writing about comes through. It's a
personal interpretation of what I feel are some great places. I
just hope people will not be disappointed.''
 &HT;    A one-year, six-issue subscription is $100. For a free sample
issue, contact ``Ogilvy's Britain &AMP; Ireland: The Insider Guide for
the Sophisticated Traveller,'' Coates House, Upper Largo, Fife, KY8
6JF, Scotland (888-OGILVYS/www.ogilvys-britain.com).

shop and to lay their heads at night. The prose is breezy, bright
and friendly, fitting for a newsletter for enthusiasts about all
things British, with a discrete nod to the Irish.
 &HT;    ``I think that as long as you're honest about a place, you can
lay it out for someone else to make their judgement,'' Ogilvy says.
 &HT;    An American enthusiast, he'd just returned from a two-week
summer vacation on the island of Nantucket.
 &HT;    ``I absolutely adore America,'' he says. ``I've got a lot of
very good American friends and I think I understand what Americans
enjoy. Unlike France or Italy or Spain, which are in or out of
fashion, Britain has a peculiar ongoing relationship with the
United States. So many Americans have links back here.''
 &HT;    The newsletter, which is priced at $100 a year, is a product
that Ogilvy hopes will have ``a clublike feel. I think someone like
Andrew Harper of 'The Hideaway Report' has done a tremendous job,
and I'd be very happy if we could emulate some of his success.''
 &HT;    Throughout the newsletter are ``Best-Kept Secrets'' such as
Cliveden Town House hotel in London and the Nefyn and District Golf
Club in Wales.
 &HT;    Does being a Royal give Ogilvy's newsletter special insight?
 &HT;    ``It doesn't necessarily give a particular slant to it,'' he
says. ``But I hope that my own experience and my own exposure to a
lot of the business we're writing about comes through. It's a
personal interpretation of what I feel are some great places. I
just hope people will not be disappointed.''
 &HT;    A one-year, six-issue subscription is $100. For a free sample
issue, contact ``Ogilvy's Britain &AMP; Ireland: The Insider Guide for
the Sophisticated Traveller,'' Coates House, Upper Largo, Fife, KY8
6JF, Scotland (888-OGILVYS/www.ogilvys-britain.com).

LEGENDARY GUITARIST JIMMY PAGE SPEAKS OUT, TOURS WITH LED ZEPPELIN
MATE 
</HEADLINE>
 PAGE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY RODGERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ask any rock musician with a few years under his or her belt for
the short list of truly legendary guitarists, and the name Jimmy
Page is sure to be mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Onstage in the '70s with his monster band, Led Zeppelin, Page
was a force to be reckoned with. Clad in black or white outfits
adorned with flaming dragons or celestial bodies, he attacked his
instrument with such speed that his fingers blurred.
</P>
<P>
   With a flair for the dramatic, Page would saw on the strings of
his Les Paul with a violin bow on occasion, and prance about as he
launched booming musical missiles into the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Page had the licks and chutzpah to go toe-to-toe
with the orgasmic vocals of Robert Plant (who joins Page for a
performance in Phoenix on Thursday).
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two decades after Led Zeppelin's demise, Page and Plant
are on tour together _ their second in four years.
</P>
<P>
   This outing ostensibly supports the pair's energetic new album,
``Walking Into Clarksdale.'' But as Page explained in a recent
interview with ``The Republic,'' it also reprises Zeppelin's
classic catalog in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   Page, 54, spoke via phone from a tour stop in Vancouver, B.C.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUESTION: On your ``Walking Into Clarksdale'' album and current
tour, you and Robert have stripped things back to a four-piece
band. What inspired you to move in that direction?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANSWER: It was the most obvious thing to do, really. We'd
always played that way; it felt (like) the most natural combination
of all, to play as that unit. It is basically a four-piece. . . .
The whole meat and potatoes of the show really is improvisation.
Not lengthy improvisation _ the songs change shape. They're totally
recognizable but then people can see, hey, they're thinking about
that and that's cool. . . . What we're really doing now is really
going out there and doing a serious rock and roll set. . . . Every
set's different every night. If you think about it, that's what
I've done all the way back to the Yardbirds.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: You've loaded up your set list on this tour with Led
Zeppelin classics as well as some tunes from your new album. Why
the decision to go that way?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: We teamed up for the last tour, ``Unledded,'' and we went
around with the orchestras and the ethnic musicians. . . . We
revisited a lot of numbers like ``Kashmir'' and gave them new
colors and new textures. . . . In the (current) set, we're doing
two numbers that one would have assumed would have been on the
``Unledded'' tour _ ``Going to California'' and ``Tangerine.''
Everything seems to work to the opposite of what people would
expect of you! Now, having done the new album, the songs that are
employed from it fit well within the set. They're presented in the
best places, so it doesn't differ at all within context. And the
rest of the material obviously is the songs that we wrote and
performed from the past and the songs that we feel good playing.
That's the most important thing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: Reports from the tour indicate that you two are in your best
musical form in years. Any reason behind that? Perhaps working a
bit of rust off the last time around, and now you're really in
stride?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: No, there was no rust on the last time around; the only
problem was that there was so much information for the audience to
take in with two orchestras going at once with the rock band
underneath. . . . But now it's back to how I've always been used to
playing, which is exploring the dynamics of the guitar so they can
hear every nuance, every subtlety and every attack. . . . It's now
totally up front, and you can't miss it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: I'm curious about the chemistry between you and Robert these
days, as opposed to when you worked together years ago. With the
passage of time, is it still the same basic feeling?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: It's probably more focused now because we've learned from
the past. We know what we are, and we know how to get the best out
of each other, really.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: That's on both a personal and a musical level?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: Oh, absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: How far did the two of you drift apart during that period
(1980 to 1994)?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: About as far a you could go. . . . If you look at what one
was doing and what the other was doing, it was pretty obvious that
we'd gone that far, and we sort of came back around.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: On a personal level, too?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: I would say in every way. But as it came together, like
walking around the edge of a circle in two different directions, we
bonded up.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: It must have been an imposing feeling going into that
rehearsal studio in north London that first day (Page's first
studio session with Plant in 14 years).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: It was sort of a make or break day, but it didn't bother me.
I knew what could be done, what would be done.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: You've been at this game more than 30 years. Is it more of a
challenge to motivate yourself to compose and tour?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: There are certain dates as you go through a tour _ key
dates, magical dates, and they're so good. The most important thing
for me is to keep re-creating that and getting better and better.
That's the prime motivation for me, to keep topping the previous
show. You keep building to a point where it gets scary.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: You've always seemed like a guy who doesn't mind sitting in
the studio and twisting knobs, and you're a wonderful performer.
Does one or the other pull at you stronger as you get a bit older?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: I'm sort of addicted to the adrenaline buzz that you get
playing live. I realize now that it's such a part of my addictive
personality that I have to do that. . . . When you're in the studio
working with the remasters (of Led Zeppelin material), that's
purely technique.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: You've brought so many musical influences to the table over
the years; I understand you traveled to Brazil before this tour.
What types of music currently intrigue you?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: In Brazil, there's the sort of music that most people are
aware of . . . those beautiful chord sequences and melodies which
are astonishing. . . . But really beneath it all, there's this sort
of trance drumming. Where I go in Brazil, there's a river that
intersects a village, so there's a hill on each side of it. And
where I stay is on the far side, where you can hear the drums going
on all night, where they're having their . . . magical ceremonies,
healing ceremonies. And you can't escape it. There's two things
there, really: rhythm and sex. And you breathe it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: Over the years, a Middle Eastern flavor has crept into your
music. What are the roots of that for you and Robert?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: Again, it's rhythm. What we're talking about now from Brazil
and Morocco is basically African. It's what came over here to be
blues and then rock and roll. . . . We found that within Arabic
music, Moroccan music, there were some extremely seductive lines _
especially when they started to bring in strings and orchestras.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: In the years since Zeppelin broke up, you've teamed with
Paul Rodgers in The Firm as well as David Coverdale. Were those
outings satisfying and/or frustrating?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: Working with Robert Plant, Paul Rodgers and John Miles as
well, on the ``Outrider'' tour . . . and then David Coverdale _
they're all tremendous singers and I've been lucky to work with
people like that.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: Was there a reason that you came full circle back to Robert
Plant?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: It was obvious that the two of us had a chemistry which I
didn't have with the other people, though we worked well together.
There was a particularly special chemistry that Robert and I had
together. . . . It was clearly evident when we came back together
and wrote two songs on the first day.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: Led Zeppelin broke so many rules and set so many precedents
as to how rock and roll is performed and marketed. You ignored the
singles charts and tipped the financial scales toward the artist
and away from the concert promoter. What possessed you to push the
status quo instead of playing it safe?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: Because the music was more important than the business. . .
. The music said more than what the business was going to say. In
those days, we didn't want to break up an album and have singles.
These days, singles are really of the utmost importance. But in
those days, you have to see it as what it was: We just believed
collectively and individually in what we were doing. . . . We
didn't want to be sidetracked with any sort of nonsense. The album
would go out, and we'd just do the concerts, and that was that.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: With the ``Clarksdale'' album getting good airplay and the
two of you in fine form, have you and Robert looked past this
current tour?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: We've got a couple of plans, actually, and they're
diametrically opposed. Not that we're disagreeing, it's just that
there's two different things to do. . . . Both projects are very
interesting, but I'd rather it come as a bit of a surprise.

   ``BILLY BREAKS OUT.'' From W magazine. One color slide. Sex,
tragedy and an Olympic athlete with major babe potential: It's no
wonder Hollywood is smitten with handsome sports idol Steve
Prefontaine, who died in a 1975 car accident at the age of 24. So
smitten, in fact, that two films have been made about the legendary
long-distance runner in the last two years. The first tanked, and
now actor Billy Crudup finds himself in the nerve-racking position
of starring in the second, titled ``Without Limits.'' In this
interview from W magazine, Crudup talks to writer Dana Wood about
his portrayal of Prefontaine, his fear of attending the premieres
of his films and his stage work.

   ``BILLY BREAKS OUT.'' From W magazine. One color slide. Sex,
tragedy and an Olympic athlete with major babe potential: It's no
wonder Hollywood is smitten with handsome sports idol Steve
Prefontaine, who died in a 1975 car accident at the age of 24. So
smitten, in fact, that two films have been made about the legendary
long-distance runner in the last two years. The first tanked, and
now actor Billy Crudup finds himself in the nerve-racking position
of starring in the second, titled ``Without Limits.'' In this
interview from W magazine, Crudup talks to writer Dana Wood about
his portrayal of Prefontaine, his fear of attending the premieres
of his films and his stage work.

JACKIE CHAN KNOWS IT' NOW OR NEVER TO BREAK INTO U.S. MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (Photo available through Wieck Photo Database)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Jackie Chan is beaming broadly as we swerve into his
suite at the Alexis Hotel. He's so happy he barely sits still,
humorously punctuating comments and insights made in fractured
English with kung fu movements and guttural noises that typlifyy
the action hero from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The 44-year-old is perfectly aware of his image. He's even
written a book in an effort to demystify the icon and humanize the
real man. Still, Chan would be mobile even if he were in a bad
mood. It's the way Jackie Chan communicates.
</P>
<P>
   And fans of Chan love it. This past week in Seattle, they lined
up in droves to buy his new autobiography, ``My Life In Action,''
and helped give his new movie, ``Rush Hour'' the top September box
office opening ever.
</P>
<P>
   The film grossed $33 million on its first weekend to help
fulfill Chan's deepest wish: to conquer America _ just once. He's
tried for years. But as he approaches middle age, he realizes it's
now or never.
</P>
<P>
   In his hotel suite, Chan zig-zags off the walls. He's here, he's
there and yet, he's ever present in the moment. And while he's
``king of the world'' this week, a phrase that makes him blanch and
hold out his hands in an off-putting gesture, he maintains enough
humility and grace to proclaim the originator of that line,
``Titanic'' director Jim Cameron, ``a genius.''
</P>
<P>
   But what made Jackie Chan write an autobiography? He laughs and
says, ``I didn't decide, Ballantine (the publisher) convinced me.
They said, `Jackie, let's do it. There are so many books already
about you. Just say yes or no.' And so many books just copy from
TV, magazines, radio _ they steal, and it's wrong. So they sent two
people to follow me for 8 months _ South Africa, Yugoslavia _
wherever.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I felt good, they were there. If I was not feeling so good,
they'd leave me alone. On the set, I'm a totally different person.
I'm not nice anymore. But most of the time I'm a happy-go-lucky
guy. So I said OK.''
</P>
<P>
   He stops and thinks for a brief moment. ``I want people to know
about my movies and about my personality. I'm not just the Jackie
Chan of today. I was very poor as a child.''
</P>
<P>
   Chan's childhood included his parents' sending him to an arts
school where the kids were disciplined in Chinese acrobatics,
theater and opera. They worked 19 hours a day and slept 5 hours a
night. They suffered through a ``Big Brother'' chain-of-command
that, while it wasn't very pretty, helped create friendships and
bonds that endure today.
</P>
<P>
   In his teens, Chan became a stunt man in the Hong Kong film
industry, a business which has had several peaks and ebbs. Along
the way, it made international superstars out of Bruce Lee and
Chan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the hardship Chan endured, he's a true optimist. He
bears no hostility toward people who have seemingly had it easy in
the movies, getting by on looks and luck. ``Oh,'' he says, ``Those
kind of people come and go. A lot of American actors are oh so
pretty. But one or two years later, they're gone. How can you just
be pretty?''
</P>
<P>
   ``They aren't like Jodie Foster or Barbra Streisand,'' he says.
``If you have talent, you stay in this business a long time. For
me, it's not about whether I'm a fighter or not. If you want to
stay in Hollywood, you have to be a multi-talent like Danny DeVito.
I love him. I concentrate on those types of people and force myself
to learn all I can so I can direct, produce, write, teach and even
edit. I could even hire the composer,'' he says proudly.
</P>
<P>
   ``After doing this for 30 years I know much about the movies and
I love the movies. The only thing I don't know is special effects.
But that I can learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Chan says the thing that separates his ``Hong Kong sensibility''
from the American action genre is humanity and comedy. ``Little
tiny things,'' he notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is Jackie Chan different from Steven Seagal or Jean-Claude
Van Damme? I'm not proud of fighting. I'm proud of the
choreography, the reason.'' Chan grasps at the meaning of the word.
``I'm reasonable,'' he stresses, explaining that it means he's not
a superhero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like humans, I like comedy. I did violent films when I was
young. But when video came out, I had the chance to watch American
artists like Buster Keaton, Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly. I learned
tempo and rhythm from them.''
</P>
<P>
   Chan breaks into an improvised movement and proclaims how
different it is from the over-the-top, invincible antics of a Bruce
Willis or Arnold Schwarzenegger movie character. ``See?'' he
gleams. ``Choreography is more difficult than fighting. In America,
a motorcyle leap starts from 20 stories and lands in a swimming
pool. It's unbelievable. I want to be between a superman and a
normal person, not the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so if Chan has this view of American movies, why is it so
important for him to conquer the market?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' he says, ``if 'Rush Hour' doesn't work, I'm finished.
I'll just go back to Hong Kong. At least now, with this opening
weekend, I broke a movie record so I'm satisfied. If a second movie
doesn't do as well, at least I am a success once. I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``''I've tried to break into the American market so many times _
`Supercop,' `Rumble In The Bronx,' `First Strike' _ and they're
better than some U.S. movies but when I see a rubbish action film
make 30 or 40 million, I think, `Why?' That's why I did `Rush Hour'
and I tried to do everything the American way with the American
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Chan have to compromise to play a second string Hong Kong
cop to Chris Tucker's outspoken, abrasive LAPD misfit?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he says. ``I feel comfortable with it because if I'm,
say, a New York cop, I'm not comfortable. But if I'm a cop from
Hong Kong helping the Los Angeles or New York police, then I'm
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   This, he says, is the biggest issue he faces, as do his fellow
acting and directing compatriots _ John Woo, Ringo Lam, Michelle
Yeoh, Maggie Cheung, Tsui Hark and Stanley Tong _ being Chinese in
the American film industry and continually facing the challenge of
finding a niche within. And with the recent decline of Hong Kong
film, where do they go if it doesn't work out in America?
</P>
<P>
   ``For a couple years now, lots of people have come here. It
really depends upon how long you can stay,'' says Chan. ``Every
country wants new things. Some producers in the U.S. are now
interested in things Asian. How long will that last? Ringo Lam and
Tsui Hark have already gone home,'' he says with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jet-Li has stayed but Michelle Yeoh went back, too. See, Asian
actors making films here are too limited. Especially by our
English. We can't play a lawyer. They write scripts for us where we
are American-born Chinese. How can I be an American born Chinese?
So they make a special role for us, like a killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really thank Quentin Tarantino and (Sylvester) Stallone for
giving us a way in. Now, after we're in, we need to find a way to
stay. We need the right agent or director because the wrong ones
will kill you and you'll go off home very quietly.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite economic restrictions in the Hong Kong film industry,
why didn't Chan feel the same limitations he does in the States?
</P>
<P>
   ``In Asia I have freedom,'' he says. ``They aren't Asian films,
they're Jackie Chan films. Don't call me an international star. I'm
an Asian star and we're proud we can get into the American market.
When I saw the director Akira Kurosawa win an Oscar, I was proud
because he was Japanese. I'm Chinese, not Japanese, and he has just
died, but even one person representing us in America is good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I've come here and my film has made $33 million and
everyone in Asia is thrilled. Still, it's a lot of pressure. If one
or two people from home make a Hollywood film, everyone is proud.
If `Rush Hour' does badly, I lose face. The money is not
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, however, he's comfortable with the world. ``I'm me,''
he says. ``I'm me in front of the screen and behind. I just follow
my age to change my character.''

IF BANKS AREN'T GOOD AS GOLD, HOW DO WE KEEP THEM SOLID? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barry Eichengreen, the Berkeley professor who wrote a 450-page
history of the collapse of the gold standard, calls the world
financial situation today ``the most precarious I've seen in my
professional life.'' He adds, ``It's as close to a global problem
as any in peacetime in 70 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The chain reaction that began on July 2, 1997, with the Thai
baht has haunting similarities to the gold crisis of 1931. ``The
single most important one,'' Eichengreen says, ``is weak banking
systems _ weak in part because they were used by governments to
further industrial policy.''
</P>
<P>
   It also is similar in the contagion's spread: in 1931 from
Austria to Hungary, Germany, Britain _ and 18 months later, to the
United States; in 1997-1998 from Thailand to Malaysia, Indonesia,
South Korea, Russia and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that so far the current crisis has not spread
to the heartland of the global economy. If Asian, Russian and Latin
American banking systems were shown to be weak, Eichengreen says,
``We have a relatively strong and well-regulated banking system in
the United States and Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Eichengreen said: ``I do not think
it's 1929. That's social-science fiction. But that's not to
diminish the severity of the situation for a large part of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Disaster brings reform, and the greatest reform will come in the
countries with the greatest disasters. Speaking to the House
Banking Committee Sept. 16, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
said Asian banking systems collapsed because of ``large unhedged
exposures in foreign currencies'' and ``near-reckless major
international borrowing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the failure of borrowers,'' he said, ``that creates the
major risks to international stability.''
</P>
<P>
   From that view, it is most worrisome when borrowers blame their
crises on lenders or speculators and opt out of the international
system, as Malaysia has just done. Currency controls were
controversial even in Malaysia; that country's prime minister,
Mahathir Mohamad, had to fire his own finance minister to do it,
and has lately had the hapless man imprisoned without trial.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia will pay for that decision. ``Any economy can operate
with its borders closed to foreign investment,'' Greenspan said.
But that economy ``will be mired at a suboptimal standard of living
and slow growth rate associated with out-of-date technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Think of international capital as electricity, and each nation's
banking system as the wiring in your house. If your fuse box shorts
out, you can blame it on all the new power you're using, or you can
replace the old box with a new one. In countries where the banks
burned out, the new financial wiring includes international
standards of accounting, bank supervision and corporate disclosure,
and the independence of bankers from politicians.
</P>
<P>
   There are some things for this country to do. We and the other
rich countries were the lenders. The lack of reliable information
from borrowers ``ought to have set off alarms,'' as Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the crisis has happened, we have given ourselves only
two options to deal with it. The first is to allow nature to take
its course, as we have just done with Russia. This was costly in
the 1930s, as Eichengreen's book, ``Golden Fetters'' (Oxford,
1992), documents, and will likely prove costly in Russia. The
second option is to rush in with taxpayer money _ a better option
than the first, Eichengreen believes, but not a good one. It may
avoid default, but it undermines the incentives to be prudent. It
is also politically unpopular because of its cost.
</P>
<P>
   Eichengreen testified to Congress Sept. 15. He said, ``Something
must be done to create an alternative to massive international
rescue packages.''
</P>
<P>
   One solution, proposed by the Group of Ten finance ministers in
1996, is to write foreign bond contracts so they are less difficult
and time-consuming to modify. Instead of allowing one bondholder to
hold up the rescheduling of debt by filing a lawsuit, have the bond
agreement be subject to the vote of a majority of creditors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Syndicated bank loan agreements already have such
provisions,'' Eichengreen says. ``The reason they are not included
in bond covenants is that William O. Douglas thought they were a
bad idea in the 1930s.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1937 and 1938, before being appointed to the Supreme Court,
our native son was head of the new Securities and Exchange
Commission. There he pushed through rules to allow small
bondholders to assert their rights.
</P>
<P>
   Thus does an old bit of populism come back and bite us in the
tail.

   HURRICANE GEORGES
</P>
<P>
   HURRICANE-GEORGES _ MIAMI _ People on the island of Hispaniola
began picking up the pieces on Wednesday, as federal officials
ordered a mandatory evacuation of the lower Florida Keys. Hurricane
Georges, which had been reduced in strength to about 75 mph, was
moving on to northern Cuba and the Bahamas by Wednesday morning.
But residents of Miami _ the memory of Hurricane Andrew still in
their minds _ were scrambling to board up homes and buy supplies.
South Florida is expected to be come under a hurricane warning as
early as Thursday morning. Developing. (Emling, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   HURRICANE-PREP _ MIAMI _ For decades, the residents of South
Florida went along thumbing their noses at hurricane watches and
warnings as storms barreled through the Caribbean headed for the
state's most populous region. Then came Andrew. With that, it
didn't take warnings from federal and state officials to get folks
here scrambling into stores _ and in some cases, fist-fighting _
for everything from plywood to water to generators. (Emling, Cox
News Service).
</P>
<P>
   HURRICANE-FEMA _ WASHINGTON _ The latest moves by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency as Hurricane Georges moves closer to

   PREP _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ What kind of furious preparations
are residents making to get ready for Georges? Are there runs on
plywood, gas, ATMs, supermarkets, etc.? Are prices increasing to
match demand? (Bierman, Palm Beach Post).
</P>
<P>
   RUSH _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Are folks pouring onto the
highways, or trying to make plane reservations/hotel reservations?
They've suspended the tolls on Florida's Turnpike. Emergency
officials are telling people to stay put for now, because they fear
a logjam. Still, are people coming to south Palm Beach County to
escape expected evacuations further south? (Desmon, Palm Beach
Post).
</P>
<P>
   COUNTRYWALK _ KENDALL, Fla. _ A visit to the Country Walk
development, which was hit hard in Andrew. How are residents coping

   COLOR _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ What do folks do when it's too
early to put up the shutters? Drink, eat, take extra Valium and
wait to go into labor. Reporter Cara Anna visits grocery and liquor
stores to find out the most popular hurricane comfort foods. One
chocolate shop has reported increased sales. We also call doctors
to see about prescriptions for anxiety pills. And we visit St.
Mary's birthing center to see how the moms-to-be wait for the
barometer to drop. (Anna, Palm Beach Post). 18. WITH PHOTOS.

   MANDELA _ WASHINGTON _ From an embassy speech to a rousing White

in what Mrs. Clinton called ``sort of a slumber party,'' Mandela
was being honored today with the Congressional Gold Medal in a
ceremony at the Capitol Rotunda. The frail, 80-year-old Mandela led
a standing ovation in the East Room after Rev. Bernice King,

she was wearing a winter coat, carrying a large handbag and looked
suspicious, store security guards were alerted. When she left the
fitting room, a guard went inside and counted less than seven items
in the changing room. Cooper was confronted in the parking lot
outside and, according to strikingly different versions of events _
whether you believe Cooper's or the security guards', she was
either accosted, groped and then strip-searched or she became
unreasonably hysterical and took off her own clothes (inside the
store's security offices after being taken screaming down an
escalator) to prove she had taken nothing. In fact, she took
nothing and the security guard missed items in the fitting room. A
verdict in the lawsuit is possible Wednesday morning. (Rankin,

`THE HUGHLEYS' IS AN UPDATE OF `THE JEFFERSONS' WITH POTENTIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If it weren't so decidedly about race, the uneven but watchable
series ``The Hughleys'' would stand a better-than-average chance of
hanging around its new TV neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Stand-up comic D.L. Hughley brings a surprisingly gentle charm
and comedic strut to this series about a black vending-machine
company owner questioning his decision to move his family to an
all-white suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Slated to follow ``Home Improvement,'' the show is most likely
to be ignored by African-Americans, I can't see ``The Hughleys''
making much of a seamless transition in viewer appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Pessimistic? Sure. But when TV audiences continue to be sliced
by race, to expect the ``Home Improvement'' followers to hang loose
with ``The Hughleys'' is naive. As for black viewers, 7:30 p.m.
Tuesdays is the perfect place to hide it.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike its lead-in, at least ``The Hughleys'' has funny moments
and something to say while getting there. Darryl (Hughley) moved to
the suburbs for challenging schools and safer streets. But
African-Americans making this transition often learn that it's
never easy when moving into the upper middle-income ranks.
</P>
<P>
   As Darryl's childhood friend, Milsap (John Henton from ``Living
Single''), theorizes while admiring Darryl's spacious new digs,
``You're on the slippery slope to losing your blackness.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because Darryl's young son is more into Hanson than Marvin
Gaye, his daughter wants a white doll over a black one, he's
decided to take up, of all things, ``this new game called golf''
and a stack of bills are about to be mailed _ on time.
</P>
<P>
   What's next, dumping Kool-Aid for tea?
</P>
<P>
   The couple from next door, Dave (Eric Allan Kramer) and his
pregnant wife, Sally (Marietta DePrima), keep popping up, wanting
to be friends. But Darryl sees this as a smoke screen, telling his
wife, Yvonne (Elise Neal), that he learned long ago not to trust
anyone, particularly white people bearing gifts.
</P>
<P>
   His wife thinks he's paranoid, and in some ways, she's right.
But since she grew up in a predominantly white neighborhood, she
can't possibly feel her husband's psychological pain. But it's
right there for all to see. Why, for instance, can Darryl go from
fear over becoming friends with his white neighbor to telling
Milsap that he has no idea what the gadget on the wall is (looks
like an intercom) ``but white folk got 'em, so you know I bought me
two.''
</P>
<P>
   As ``The Hughleys'' matures, the running theme will revolve
around ``selling out'' and the emotional baggage that blacks bring
when escaping to the suburbs. It's baggage handed to them by other
blacks who make distinctions between being an ``authentic'' black
person (living in the inner city around other blacks) or a ``fake''
one (living in a largely white suburb because you want to be
``them''). When Milsap asks Darryl whether he's ``trying to get
your ghetto pass revoked?'' that's exactly what he's insinuating.
</P>
<P>
   If there's something that may rankle some African-Americans,
it's the move to constantly exonerate the show's white characters.
I noticed a pattern where Darryl cries ``wolf'' about racism only
to be proved wrong. To set the precedent that racism is merely his
paranoia will only make this series scream out for criticism.
</P>
<P>
   It's no diss to say ``The Hughleys'' is an updated version of
``The Jeffersons.'' His character is also self-made and therefore
quite raw in the ways of middle-income protocol. Even though he has
made enough money to keep up with the Joneses, he doesn't feel all
that compelled to spend time with them.
</P>
<P>
   Future episodes show this clearly as Yvonne works her way into
community involvement. That everyone she works with is white is of
no significance to her. ``I want to make friends here, build a
life,'' she informs Darryl.
</P>
<P>
   This is something he has grave difficulty with. This is also
where ``The Hughleys'' can be an edgy comedy with something to say.
What a concept that would be.  &QL;

IT'S IN THE NUMBERS: THE GREATEST ATHLETES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ First off, the following is an exercise in
futility. Trying to come up with the greatest athlete ever by
uniform number in an objective manner is, objectively speaking,
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   So we tried anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The basic criteria from the boss is this: No ties, and get as
many Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Orioles in as possible.
(Unfortunately, a few did make the list _ on merit). Some
selections will be weaker than others because of the quality of
athlete at each number.
</P>
<P>
   The endeavor is inherently flawed, since comparing, say, Bobby
Orr to Lou Gehrig is empirically difficult.
</P>
<P>
   So we tried anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Sports Illustrated did its list, which was not
consulted until after the following was compiled. To show you how
subjective it is, half the selections are different.
</P>
<P>
   Football dominates the list of 101 (0, 1-99, 00) with 58
selections, primarily because of the range of numbers worn by that
sport's players. Baseball was next with 28, followed by basketball
(7), hockey (6) and other (2).
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Bears topped all teams with eight selections,
followed by the Steelers with six. The New York Yankees and New
York (Football) Giants each had four honorees, tying them with the
Baltimore Colts, Dallas Cowboys and Miami Dolphins for third place.
</P>
<P>
   We may have missed somebody, or we may just be wrong. That said,
let the arguing begin:
</P>
<P>
   0. Al Oliver. In a small field, Oliver beats out Rey Ordonez,
Orlando Woolridge (that's a lot of O's) and several others.
</P>
<P>
   1. Jacques Plante. The Montreal Canadiens goalie edges Terry
Sawchuck, Ozzie Smith, Pee Wee Reese and QB Warren Moon for a
numeral dominated by goalies, shortstops and kickers.
</P>
<P>
   2. Doug Harvey. The best hockey defenseman before Bobby Orr
beats old-time Tiger Charlie Gehringer and a pair of Dodgers
managers, Leo Durocher and Tommy Lasorda.
</P>
<P>
   3. Babe Ruth. You expecting Bud Harrelson?
</P>
<P>
   4. Bobby Orr. Hockey legend in a squeaker over Lou Gehrig.
</P>
<P>
   5. Joe DiMaggio. Joltin' Joe barely clips Johnny Bench.
</P>
<P>
   6. Bill Russell. All those rings give him the nod over Stan
Musial and Julius Erving.
</P>
<P>
   7. Mickey Mantle. He will always be the 7.
</P>
<P>
   8. Cal Ripken Jr. The jog around Camden Yards helped the modern
ironman beat Yogi Berra, Bill Dickey, Carl Yastrzemski and Willie
Stargell.
</P>
<P>
   9. Ted Williams. It took the Greatest Hitter Who Ever Lived to
win out over Gordie Howe.
</P>
<P>
   10. Pele. The soccer legend with the compact name and this
compact numeral are perfect for each other.
</P>
<P>
   11. Paul Waner. The name of the Pirates' ``Big Poison'' should
come up more in discussing the all-time greats.
</P>
<P>
   12. Terry Bradshaw. Again, titles win out in a battle with Roger
Staubach, Joe Namath and several other QBs.
</P>
<P>
   13. Wilt Chamberlain. Jump ball with Dan Marino. He's taller.
</P>
<P>
   14. Pete Rose. Hustle helps him beat Oscar Robertson, Don
Hutson, Bob Cousy and Ernie Banks.
</P>
<P>
   15. Bart Starr. Quarterbacks win or lose titles.
</P>
<P>
   16. Joe Montana. See Starr. The ultimate winner.
</P>
<P>
   17. John Havlicek. Celtic stole the number from Cool Papa Bell
and Dizzy Dean.
</P>
<P>
   18. Charlie Joiner. Remember that not too long ago he had the
NFL career record for receptions.
</P>
<P>
   19. Johnny Unitas. A hair better than Bob Feller.
</P>
<P>
   20. Barry Sanders. Potentially the best rusher ever beats the
best 3B ever, Mike Schmidt.
</P>
<P>
   21. Roberto Clemente. Throw a fastball six feet out of the
strike zone and he could still double to right.
</P>
<P>
   22. Elgin Baylor. Over Emmitt Smith. Baylor with two good knees
was grace in high tops, Dr. J before Dr. J.
</P>
<P>
   23. Michael Jordan. Don't even bother trying to think of another
23.
</P>
<P>
   24. Willie Mays. Mays may be seriously challenged in the near
future by Ken Griffey Jr. and Jeff Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   25. Barry Bonds. Check the numbers over the decade. There has
been no one better.
</P>
<P>
   26. Satchel Paige. Would be even more of a legend if not for the
color barrier.
</P>
<P>
   27. Juan Marichal. High-kicking Left Coast pitcher was
overshadowed by Koufax.
</P>
<P>
   28. Darrell Green. The Redskin is one of the best covermen and
returners ever.
</P>
<P>
   29. Rod Carew. The textbook hitter of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   30. Nolan Ryan. A little cheating. Ryan wore the number early in
his career with the Mets and Angels (34 thereafter).
</P>
<P>
   31. Greg Maddux. How long before we realize an immortal is in
our midst?
</P>
<P>
   32. Jim Brown. The toughest competition of any number. Sandy
Koufax and Magic Johnson are also deserving, as are O.J. Simpson,
Franco Harris and Julius Erving (from his ABA days).
</P>
<P>
   33. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Only longevity, and wearing it first,
gives Kareem the nod over Larry Bird.
</P>
<P>
   34. Walter Payton. All-time rushing champ. Along with Sanders
and Gale Sayers, among the most electrifying runners ever.
</P>
<P>
   35. Frank Thomas. The Big Hurt is having a hurting season, but
he has HOF numbers.
</P>
<P>
   36. Gaylord Perry. Just enough juice to get by Robin Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   37. Casey Stengel. Even the number seems stooped.
</P>
<P>
   38. Ray Dandridge. Some argue the Negro League star was the best
3B ever.
</P>
<P>
   39. Roy Campanella. Like Banks, brought joy with him to the
ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   40. Gale Sayers. See 34.
</P>
<P>
   41. Tom Seaver. Power and class, the miracle maker of the 1969
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   42. Jackie Robinson. Good enough to have his number retired by
his sport.
</P>
<P>
   43. Richard Petty. He had the coolest car, the coolest shades
and the coolest hat in auto racing. Oh yeah: He was the best driver
of his generation.
</P>
<P>
   44. Hank Aaron. Something about that 44 trotting around the
bases gives Aaron the edge over the glide of Jerry West and the
swagger of Reggie Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   45. Bob Gibson. The king of the hill from a day when pitchers
owned the outside half of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   46. Doug Plank. The Chicago DB's number was used to name the
famed ``46 Defense'' of the 1980s Bears.
</P>
<P>
   47. Mel Blount. Blunter still were the hits this Steelers DB
delivered.
</P>
<P>
   48. Daryl ``Moose'' Johnston. When God invented fullbacks, he
had Johnston in mind.
</P>
<P>
   49. Hoyt Wilhelm. Reliever outlasts fellow knuckleballer Charlie
Hough.
</P>
<P>
   50. Mike Singletary. This linebacker's bulging eyes pierced
running backs' souls _ and saw fear.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   51. Dick Butkus. THE middle linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   52. Mike Webster. He kept Tery Bradshaw alive.
</P>
<P>
   53. Don Drysdale. As nasty as Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   54. Randy White. A defensive line terror with a linebacker's
number.
</P>
<P>
   55. LeRoy Jordan. He anchored the Doomsday Defense in Dallas in
the '60s and early '70s.
</P>
<P>
   56. Lawrence Taylor. The LB may be the best football player ever
at any position.
</P>
<P>
   57. Dwight Stephenson. The glue at center for the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   58. Jack Lambert. The man in need of a dentist often sent
runners to the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   59. Jack Ham. Anybody Lambert didn't get, Ham did.
</P>
<P>
   60. Chuck Bednarik. The last of the true two-way legends.
</P>
<P>
   61. Bill George. A true Monster of the Midway.
</P>
<P>
   62. Jim Langer. Everyone on that 1970s Dolphins line could go
in.
</P>
<P>
   63. Willie Lanier. In the era of Butkus and Ray Nitschke, Lanier
still ranks as one of the best middle LB of his time.
</P>
<P>
   64. Jerry Kramer. Offensive guard turned a goal-line QB sneak in
the NFL championship into a literary career.
</P>
<P>
   65. Dave Butz. Tough Washington Redskins DT.
</P>
<P>
   66. Mario Lemieux. Only Gretzky may have been greater. Dekes out
Ray Nitschke.
</P>
<P>
   67. Bob Kuechenberg. Dolphin opened a lot of holes for Csonka,
Kiick and Morris.
</P>
<P>
   68. L.C. Greenwood. Another important link in the Steel Curtain.
</P>
<P>
   69. Conrad Dobler. The Cardinals/Bills offensive lineman was
biting people long before Mike Tyson thought of it.
</P>
<P>
   70. Sam Huff. The greatest Giants linebacker ever before LT came
along.
</P>
<P>
   71. Alex Karras. If only for being ``Mongo'' in ``Blazing
Saddles.''
</P>
<P>
   72. Carlton Fisk. Pudge wore 27 with the BoSox, but played most
of his career with ChiSox.
</P>
<P>
   73. John Hannah. The offensive lineman was the only thing that
kept QBs alive on some bad Pats teams.
</P>
<P>
   74. Bob Lilly. Cowboys great beats out Merlin Olsen.
</P>
<P>
   75. Deacon Jones. If the stat was kept at the time, Jones could
be the all-time sack leader. Beats out Mean Joe Greene.
</P>
<P>
   76. Lou Groza. Could go in as a tackle or a kicker.
</P>
<P>
   77. Red Grange. The Galloping Ghost was a double-seven running
back who rang up a lot of sixes.
</P>
<P>
   78. Anthony Munoz. Tackle fends off Bruce Smith, Bubba Smith and
Art Shell.
</P>
<P>
   79. Roosevelt Brown. The anchor of the New York Giants offensive
line during the 1950s and '60s. Beats Dallas DL Harvey Martin.
</P>
<P>
   80. Jerry Rice. See 56.
</P>
<P>
   81. Art Monk. Elegant receiver, even as he was getting hammered
over the middle.
</P>
<P>
   82. Raymond Berry. Colts WR's soft hands could catch an egg from
a sling shot and not break it.
</P>
<P>
   83. Ted Hendricks. The Stork delivered pain for the Colts and
Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   84. Andy Robustelli. Dominating defensive lineman for the Rams
and Giants in the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   85. Nick Buoniconti. The core of the No-Name Defense.
</P>
<P>
   86. Buck Buchanan. Along with Lanier, part of a terrifying
Chiefs defense.
</P>
<P>
   87. Willie Davis. Packers legend who anchored the defense with
Nitschke.
</P>
<P>
   88. Alan Page. A Purple People Eater who may some day end up on
the Supreme Court. Beats Lynn Swann and Drew Pearson.
</P>
<P>
   89. Gino Marchetti. A terror on the Colts line.
</P>
<P>
   90. Bob Kurland. One of the original great college basketball
7-footers.
</P>
<P>
   91. Sergei Federov. Nothing defective about this two-time
Stanley Cup winner for the Detroit Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   92. Reggie White. The Preacher has been in the house every
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   93. Lee Roy Selmon. The pro football hall of famer wore 93
during his legendary career at Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   94. Charles Haley. Pass rushing monster for two different Super
Bowl franchises.
</P>
<P>
   95. Richard Dent. Super Bowl MVP on maybe the greatest defensive
team ever.
</P>
<P>
   96. Clyde Simmons. Longtime lineman with Eagles and others.
</P>
<P>
   97. Art Still. Tough lineman with the Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   98. Tom Harmon. The 1940 Heisman-winning halfback for Michigan
also sired another college football star who turned actor, Mark

   00. Jim Otto. This Raider played center with a quarterback's

<P>
   You might be wondering why some early stars of baseball such as
Ty Cobb, Christy Mathewson and Walter Johnson aren't on the list.
The simple answer is they didn't have jersey numbers, which did not
become commonplace until the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   In 1888, the Cincinnati Reds wore numbers on their sleeves,
after a failed previous attempt by other teams to use different
colors to designate positions that players manned. In 1916, the
Cleveland Indians stole the idea of numbers on sleeves for a June
26 game against the White Sox. The Washington Senators went one
step further, adopting numbers for players for the 1924-25 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until the Yankees of 1929 that large numbers on
the backs of uniforms became a staple. The numbers were assigned
according to the player's normal spot in the batting order, which
is why Babe Ruth was 3 and Lou Gehrig 4.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the American League made numbers mandatory,
followed by the National League two years later.

   Home Section stories in sight at this hour from The N.Y. Times
News Service for Thursday, Sept. 24:
</P>
<P>
   CONSTRUCTION-MANAGER (New York) _ Randy Polumbo is not an
interior decorator. Or an architect. Or a general contractor. In a
way, he is all of them _ the owner's eyes and ears on the job. He
is one of a relatively new breed of home improvement specialists: a
construction manager. By Tracie Rozhon.
</P>
<P>
   LARSEN-TEXTILE-DESIGN (Undated) _ Jack Lenor Larsen was ready
for his close-up. ``It's nun's veiling,'' he said of the sheer,
black, collarless suit he was wearing that summer day, ``designed
by my friend Massimo Vignelli. It's cooler than cotton.'' Larsen is
a man of the cloth, but it's not like that. He is possibly the most
accomplished textile designer living, certainly one of the most
innovative and influential of the second half of the twentieth
century. By
</P>
<P>
   NY-REAL-ESTATE (New York) _ Hundreds of sellers of co-ops and
condominiums dropped their prices last week, according to
principals of two of Manhattan's best-known real estate companies,
the Halstead Property Co. and the Corcoran Group, who call these
the first such recognizable drops since the early 1990s. By Tracie
Rozhon.
</P>
<P>
   CORPORATE-LOGOS (Undated) _ Corporate logos are supposed to be
universal and unchanging, their color, size and placement spelled
out in corporate-image policy books. From the International
Business Machines Corporation to Federal Express, the power to
imprint everything from a headquarters building to business cards
has been a sign of corporate efficiency and organization, implying
a power and dependability customers could trust. But lately logos
show signs of softening up and growing more playful. By Phil
Patton.
</P>
<P>
   NY-MADISON-AVE (New York) _ In retailing, the young, the trendy
and the new have tended to go downtown, to Tribeca, Soho and
Chelsea. So it's nice to see new life appearing this season on
Madison Avenue, especially that stretch between 79th Street and
86th Street. By Marianne Rohrlich.
</P>
<P>
   OFFICE-CUBICLES (Undated) _ Anyone who works in a cubicle knows
that its shroudlike isolation bears no resemblance to real privacy.
But it may come as a surprise that the people who design today's
office systems agree that cubicles are long overdue for a makeover.
By Julie Iovine.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Garden questions answered. By Dora
Galitzski.
</P>
<P>
   HOME-IMPROVEMENT (Undated) _ The Home Improvement column. By
Edward Lipinski.

GERSHWIN'S CENTENNIAL IS A POIGNANT REMINDER OF WHAT COULD HAVE
BEEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mozart died at 35; the quality and quantity of his music would
indicate a life of many more decades. Schubert died at 31, yet his
symphonies and songs seem the product of a long, full life.
Mendelssohn died at 38, having defined the oratorio and saying all
he needed to say. Chopin, dying at 39, left an unmatched body of
piano music. Even Bizet, who died at 36, left us with one work,
``Carmen,'' that seems enough for one lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one composer whose life's work was obviously left
unfinished. George Gershwin, whose 100th birthday is Saturday, was
just starting out when he died at 38.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, the cliche of American politics was to be born
in a log cabin. In American music, the equivalent cliche was to be
born in the tenements of New York _ as was Gershwin. Like other
musical geniuses, he was a slave to his talent, drawn to the making
of music more than to anything else in life.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for us, he was surrounded by the energy and the
music of early 20th-century New York.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ives, who doubtless passed within a few hundred yards of
Gershwin many times without ever meeting him, preserved in his
revolutionary music the rock-solid tunes and stalwart spirit of
small town, Protestant America. It is the America of Independence
Day parades and camp meetings and concerts in the park.
</P>
<P>
   But Gershwin captured the fizz and rattle of the new urban
America, noisy with streetcars and speakeasies and filled with
European Catholic and Jewish immigrants and northward-migrating
African-Americans. Is it just coincidence that Ives, although he
lived 16 years past Gershwin's death, lost his inspiration just as
Gershwin moved into his heyday? The creative vitality of America
had passed from Ives' America to Gershwin's.
</P>
<P>
   First for Gershwin came success on Tin Pan Alley, then Broadway.
Virtually without formal training, he found new twists of harmony
that make the songs he wrote for Broadway shows stand out from
those of his contemporaries like diamonds surrounded by charcoal.
Only Cole Porter, who was just getting warmed up in the 1930s when
Gershwin died, comes close.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other innovators, however, Gershwin never lost his fans.
He knew how to bring them along with him. Although many of the
musicals are forgettable as dramatic works, many of the songs that
came from them are masterpieces that today easily grace the concert
stage.
</P>
<P>
   But Gershwin wanted more than success on Broadway and in
Hollywood. He had sneaked into the concert hall a time or two, and
he envisioned the potential of the concerto and tone poem when
enlivened with the idioms of jazz and Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Thus came into being ``Rhapsody in Blue,'' the Piano Concerto in
F and ``An American in Paris,'' the works that epitomize Gershwin's
music, and, to many, American music.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, ``Porgy and Bess,'' that sprawling but
irresistible hodgepodge, the great American opera, the one work of
art that captured the agony and bittersweet reality of life in
America. Bess left the small, tight-knit world of Catfish Row to go
to New York for ``happy dust'' _ just as America left behind its
simple past for the temptations of the modern, urban world.
Gershwin made the bitter pill easier to swallow when he cloaked it
in the most melodious score ever written in this hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Gershwin died from bad advice: psychoanalyst Gregory Zilboorg
assured him that if he came to grips with his greed and ego, those
terrible headaches would go away.
</P>
<P>
   But Zilboorg was wrong. By the time Gershwin's brain tumor was
discovered, it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   And a rare synthesis of art music and popular spirit died with
him.
</P>
<P>
   What might Gershwin have gone on to? We could use 21 more
Preludes for Piano such as the three he left us. We miss the
second, third or fourth piano concertos, the Ballades and Sonatas
he might have shaped, to be premiered by a young Van Cliburn. We
miss the art songs he would have sent to a young Leontyne Price,
the violin concerto he would have written for Jascha Heifetz. And
we miss the shows that would have picked up where the subtle
political satire of ``Of Thee I Sing'' and ``Let 'Em Eat Cake''
left off.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, we miss and need the operas. It's as if Puccini had
died after writing ``Manon Lescaut,'' the first of his
masterpieces. We miss the steps Gershwin would have taken beyond
``Porgy and Bess,'' the further happy marriage of popular idiom and
classical form. And we miss the insight into the soul of America he
was just beginning to reveal.  &QL;

JUDGE DISMISSES PORTION OF INTERNET COPYRIGHT SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SETH ROSENFELD   
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A federal judge in Los Angeles has dismissed a
copyright lawsuit filed by a photographer who contended that one of
his photos was improperly used on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Manuel Real on Monday dismissed Gary
Bernstein's lawsuit against Elizabeth Arden Inc., the maker of
Passion perfume.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein claimed that Arden was liable because a J.C. Penney
Internet site that promoted the perfume had a link to a separate
Web site about movie stars, which in turn had a link to a third
site in Sweden that displayed _ without his permission _ his
photograph of Elizabeth Taylor, the spokeswoman for the perfume.
</P>
<P>
   Since Arden acted alone in seeking the dismissal, J.C. Penney
remains a defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Observers said it was the first case to claim a copyright
violation based on multiple Internet links. Viewers click on links,
the highlighted words or icons on Web pages, to move from one site
to another.
</P>
<P>
   Several experts said the lawsuit threatened the way the Web
works, because it presented Web-site operators with the daunting
prospect of screening sites they were linked.
</P>
<P>
   The Beverly Hills photographer claimed that Arden and J.C.
Penney Co. Inc. had violated his copyright. Copyright law prohibits
copying or distributing someone else's creative expression without
his or her permission. Copyright infringements can lead to
injunctions and orders to pay damages.
</P>
<P>
   Arden countered that it had no control over the J.C. Penney Web
site and, even if it did, was not responsible for photos shown on a
site three links away.
</P>
<P>
   Upholding a theory that it was liable for the content of other
Web sites ``would bring traffic on the Information Highway to a
standstill,'' said a brief filed by Arden's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein countered that the case was not about the obligation
to screen ``the entire (Web) for infringing sites.'' He claimed
that Arden and J.C. Penney had designed the Penney Web site to link
to his photo to avoid paying him fees, which Arden denied.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Craft, a Los Angeles lawyer representing J.C. Penney,
said his client would seek a settlement with Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Grannan, Bernstein's lawyer, could not be reached for
comment, and it was unknown whether his client would appeal the

A GUIDE TO DETER HACKERS
</HEADLINE>
  (af)  
 By KAREN FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   People who have trouble remembering how to dial into a company
computer from home or retrieve their e-mail while on the road may
find it hard to picture just what a malicious hacker does to break
into government and company computers.
</P>
<P>
   They need wonder no more. In its October issue, Scientific
American offers a startling amount of practical detail in a special
report on how mighty networks can be brought to their knees.
</P>
<P>
   The main article is a fictitious story about a battle of wills
between a criminal hacker and a quick-witted system administrator.
Even though the hacker is named Abednego, for the Biblical
character who walked through a wall of fire (or firewall), he loses
in the end.
</P>
<P>
   The tale is based on actual incidents on the wild Web, according
to the author, Carolyn P. Meinel, a widely known security expert
who calls herself a ``white-hat hacker.''
</P>
<P>
   The story describes many hacking tools, like how a stealth port
scanner looks for an undefended route into a computer system and
how password crackers try every word in a dictionary or phone book
to gain access to a system.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meinel makes more tips available on her Web site
(www.happyhacker.org), including excerpts from her book ``The Happy
Hacker'' (American Eagle Press, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   All that information, of course, can be used as a primer for
computer criminals as well as a self-defense manual for those
trying to protect their systems from attacks.
</P>
<P>
   John Rennie, editor in chief of Scientific American, said in a
note accompanying the special report that the magazine had
seriously considered the risks before deciding to publish its guide
to computer security, which also included descriptions of defenses
against hackers and encryption techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serious hackers already know these secrets,'' he wrote.
``Anyone who wants to know how to crack a system can get all the
advice he (or, rarely, she) needs on Web sites and bulletin boards.
The software equivalents of crowbars and lockpicks are available on
line. Hackers don't need to be programmers these days any more than
burglars need to be architects.''
</P>
<P>
   A quick look on the Web using ordinary search engines found
plenty of hacker programs of the type described by Ms. Meinel
available for downloading. (One can get a taste of the kinds of
hacker aids available on the Web by looking at www.jabukie.com or
www.members.tripod.com/donkboy/filez/virus.htm.)
</P>
<P>
   Many hacker programs seem to be designed for Unix, which isn't
surprising because it's such a popular operating system. And
because that's the system used by most college campuses, where many
hackers cut their cyberteeth.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes spent testing some of the strategies Ms. Meinel
describes showed that they were indeed easy to master, requiring no
programming skills. ``I'm trying to debunk the idea that someone
has to be a genius to run this stuff,'' she said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Hacking is tedious, with successes that come only after much
trial and error. But the thrill of intermittent rewards can be a
powerful motivator of human behavior, as gambling addicts know.
</P>
<P>
   Those hooked on the thrills but not thrilled at the prospect of
having the FBI knocking at the door can blow off steam harmlessly
at the Happy Hacker site, which teaches people how to hack and
challenges hackers to break into computers set up for just that
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a half-hour, teen-agers can do things that can
absolutely amaze their friends, and it's all legal and all
harmless,'' Ms. Meinel said. ``I just like to play around with this
giant computer game out there called the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Malicious hacking, of course, is no game. Hackers have violated
national security laws by breaking into government computers and
have broken into company systems to commit crimes.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 13, an attack forced The New York Times on the Web to
go off line for several hours. Both Ms. Meinel and Scientific
American say publishing a guide to hacking is a responsible way to
make people aware of security risks and give them the information
they need to counter such attacks, not an irresponsible
dissemination of dangerous information.
</P>
<P>
   If such information is kept quiet, the argument goes, malicious
hackers will be armed while many of their targets will be
defenseless. One computer programmer said the argument was
analogous to a National Rifle Association slogan: If guns are
outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meinel said that many of the security loopholes she
described in ``The Happy Hacker'' had been plugged since the book
came out in March, prompting her to plan a new edition for this
fall. ``A lot of things got more secure that I had in the first
book,'' she said, ``and I'm glad of that.''

PAULA WOLFERT'S COOKING LESSONS ARE FLAVORED WITH HISTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paula Wolfert knows from Mediterranean food. And she wants you
to know from Mediterranean food, too.
</P>
<P>
   As a cookbook author, Wolfert has spent 30 years chronicling the
food of her onetime adopted home. She began with ``Couscous and
Other Good Foods From Morocco'' and has just added ``Mediterranean
Grains and Greens'' (HarperCollins, $27.50), for a total of six
books about the region.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, she taught a class at Fort Worth's ode to the
Mediterranean, Bistro Louise. Fifty people watched as Wolfert
demonstrated the fine points of polenta with onions and black
paella.
</P>
<P>
   A class with Paula Wolfert, 60, is no easy undertaking. For one
thing, restaurant owner Louise Lamensdorf had to mail-order
purchase many of the ingredients: Spanish smoked paprika,
Calasparra rice, cuttlefish in its own ink. And the author can be
prickly. Equipment is incorrect (stainless works better than
Calphalon when braising leeks), there's too much shrimp and not
enough mussels in the paella, it's not the best saffron because it
has yellow flecks in it (the best is from Kashmir or Iran).
</P>
<P>
   Even though she's the one doing the cooking, a class with
Wolfert can be exhausting. Indeed, so can cooking from her books in
your own kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Wolfert's recipes are complicated. It's more an
authenticity issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can use risotto (an Italian short-grained rice) to make
paella, but it won't be the same,'' Wolfert says. ``And don't put
in too much seafood. The seafood is only meant to be a garnish.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the lengths that Wolfert has gone to in chronicling these
ancient cultures and their food, you can understand her commitment.
</P>
<P>
   The sea that gives this region life is also a major source of
its food, with offerings of squid, octopus and anchovies. But the
bounty of the land also makes a contribution with wheat, corn,
grains, black-eyed peas, garlic, chiles, pomegranates and pine
nuts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, Wolfert and her ``starter'' husband arrived in Tangier
with an introductory letter to Paul and Jane Bowles. So began her
love affair with Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   Although the culinary love affair continued, the marriage
failed. But a romance, and later marriage, with mystery writer Bill
Bayer (the Frank Janek series) and the publication of her couscous
book in 1973 made her a woman with a mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone should document how it's made, right?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   And she certainly has. From Macedonian relish with green
tomatoes to Kurdish eggplant casserole with lamb, garlic and sumac,
Wolfert goes to the source to find her recipes, tramping around the
region with a guide and a driver (she doesn't have a license). Five
or six times a year she leaves her San Francisco home, bound for
Europe and points beyond to track down recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Her books are lessons in civilization and history as much as
they are cookbooks. For instance, although olive oil is now the fat
of choice throughout the Mediterranean, there is still some use of
sheep-tail fat. In fact, in Herodotus' time (the fifth century
B.C.), sheep were bred to have such large hindquarters that they
could not walk. Smart cooks, these; they rigged two-wheel carts in
which to place the animals' posteriors.
</P>
<P>
   Although Wolfert revels in the history, she doesn't have tunnel
vision about her subject. ``It all seems very romantic, these
cultures,'' she says. ``But the life is very hard. Women do all the
cooking with only a paring knife and a mortar and pestle. A lot of
the women have no real future because of the rise of
fundamentalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as some things are digressing, in other ways they are
moving too far away from the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, long-grain rice is subsidized by the Common Market
because that's what those cultures prefer. So what's happening is
that short-grain rice is getting outrageously expensive. So what
could happen is that short-grain rice will probably die out,''
Wolfert says. This won't matter to the Italians and the French, who
prefer long-grain rice, but the North Africans prefer short-grain
rice.
</P>
<P>
   While Wolfert's beloved Mediterranean continues in its mellow
ways of centuries past, she continues her mission. She is scheduled
to tape a show teaching Martha Stewart how to make couscous in true
North African style _ on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got these big wide pants just for sitting in while making
couscous between your legs on the floor,'' Wolfert says. ``Do you
think Martha will wear them?''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone can convince her, it's Wolfert.  &QL;

DESTROYED GERMAN SYNAGOGUES RETURN TO LIFE ON A WEB PAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MELISSA P. McNAMARA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
  History repeats itself. Haunted by this prophecy, Marc Grellert,
a professor at Darmstadt Technical University in Germany, started a
project that is bringing to virtual life German synagogues that
were destroyed during World War II.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The project serves not only as ``a memorial to German history,''
Grellert said by telephone from Darmstadt, which is near Frankfurt,
but also to ``admonish'' Germany for erasing from the historical
record sacred buildings that once contributed to the country's
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, the project's recreated synagogues have been
prominently displayed on the university's architecture department's
Web site, www.cad.architektur.tu-darmstadt.de. Visitors to the site
can view three-dimensional images of the synagogues and read about
the architectural and cultural history of each.
</P>
<P>
   Three Frankfurt synagogues, located about 20 miles from
Darmstadt, have been completed and are displayed on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Grellert said his class planned to add sketches of 15 more
synagogues by the year 2000 to commemorate Kristallnacht, the
outburst of anti-Semitic violence that presaged the Holocaust.
Grellert wants to the class to concentrate on rebuilding synagogues
destroyed in such large cities as Berlin, Dresden, Dusseldorf and
Hamburg. He said that way he hopes to draw more attention to the
exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Grellert said that a neo-Nazi arson attack on one of the few
remaining synagogues in the German city of Lubeck in 1994 was a
catalyst for setting up the site.
</P>
<P>
   As a frightening reminder of the past persecution of Jews,
Grellert said, it was an impetus for the university's pilot CAD
architecture project to reconstruct on the Web several German
synagogues that could have remained buried in the rubble of
history.
</P>
<P>
   Grellert said he discovered that there was a startling lack of
information available in books and records about the architecture
of German synagogues. Few buildings escaped destruction during
World War II, but in Germany synagogues were specifically targeted
by the Nazi's, who left no trace of their existence, Grellert
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding beyond Germany's borders, during Kristallnacht, or
``night of broken glass,'' in November 1938, Nazis set fire to more
than 35 synagogues in Bohemia and Moravia, now in the Czech
Republic. Twenty-five German synagogues were destroyed after World
War II in arson or bomb attacks. Markers at the original sites of
many synagogues are the only signs of their existence, Grellert
said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidance of Professor Manfred Koob, the project's
director and chairman of Darmstadt University's CAD department, the
synagogues were reconstructed from preserved blueprints, photos,
and from the recollections of Germans who once worshipped in the
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   But the virtual reconstruction of the main synagogue, located
just outside Frankfurt, was not easy. Few pictures of the exterior
existed, there was only one photograph of the interior and one
floor plan.
</P>
<P>
   It is particularly critical to record these memories vivid for
Holocaust survivors, who are advancing in age, Grellert said. The
Judengasse Museum in Frankfurt had preserved some models, which
helped the students construct the synagogues' facades.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, using CAD software, Grellert built a town planning
model of eastern Frankfurt, placing the synagogues at the sites
where each once stood.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a seminar class of eight students and seven professors
began the project using the Speedikon CAD program on Unix computers
to build two-dimensional computer drawings, which provided the
framework for ground plans.
</P>
<P>
   Though CAD software programs render highly detailed,
three-dimensional images, the user first has to put the structural
models into the program. These models are constructed by compiling
detailed information about the building's architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Though he is not Jewish, as a student of architecture, Grellert
``wanted to show the contribution of the Jewish community on German
society.'' Since the exhibition serves, in this sense, as a tribute
to the contribution of German Jews to the country's architecture,
the project's organizers will not accept money for their project
from German Jewish organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The project's expenses to date have come to about $75,000,
Grellert estimates, which includes stipends for the university's
staff, and hardware and software expenses. The German government
has provided nominal financing for the project. The university has
received financial support from the Judengasse Museum in Frankfurt
as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Judengasse Museum also displayed the images in its September
1996 exhibition, ``Fragments and Reconstruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Each synagogue was selected for its distinctive architecture,
Grellert said. The Borneplatz Synagogue, burned down by the Nazi's
on Nov. 10, 1938, was known as the ``red synagogue at Borneplatz''
because of the color of the sandstone used in its 1882
construction. The synagogue once stood as one of four synagogues
silhouetting Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   The exterior shape of the synagogue was influenced by Italian
Renaissance architecture. An orthodox synagogue, it was built so
men could enter through a door close to the tower in the southern
facade, while women entered through an additional building to the
north. A gas station and flower market now stand on the site.
</P>
<P>
   The facade of the main synagogue, the first one to be virtually
created, was originally constructed with red stone from a nearby
river region. The Oriental and Gothic architecture reflected the
bold self-confidence of the Jewish community of the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Koob emphasized the importance of remembering the past.
``Perhaps it has become more important again, to cultivate the
common spiritual site and to preserve it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By reaching out to a wider audience than the history books have,
Koob said the digital processing of information aids ``the
transmission of the cultural knowledge of humankind'' to a third
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Historical preservation via the Internet is making history more
accessible. ``When you do things in print and video, you have to
sell the information in a package, a unit,'' said Michael Declun,
creator of Cybrary of the Holocaust, a Web site he began in 1995 to
provide links to information about the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Cybrary of the Holocaust (www.remember.org) reaches over 30,000
people a month. Darmstadt University's progress on the 15
additional synagogues will be updated on the University's Web site.
The cyber project also includes a movie that simulates a walk
through the Frankfurt synagogues that can be viewed via its
Internet site.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When running water was introduced into American homes, the first
pipes were made of lead. They were made by hammering lead sheets
around a round form. The seams were melted together to form a
watertight seal. Back then, lead was referred to by the Latin word
''plumbum,'' and the man who fashioned and installed the pipes was
called a ''plumber.'' The lead pipes were, of course, toxic, and
many homeowners died from drinking the water.
</P>
<P>
   Today, residential water-supply pipes are made of steel, plastic
or copper. Most builders and plumbers prefer to use copper pipe
because it is easy to work with, and it resists corrosion and scale
buildup.
</P>
<P>
   Copper pipe comes in two types: rigid (sometimes called hard
temper) and flexible (soft-temper). It is available in three
weights. Weight refers to the thickness of the pipe wall and is
designated by the letters ''K,'' ''L'' and ''M.'' L is a
medium-weight pipe and is the best weight for indoor plumbing. K,
the heaviest pipe, is used primarily for underground lines
outdoors. Many building codes restrict the use of M pipe to heating
applications.
</P>
<P>
   Rigid copper pipe is generally available in 10- and 20-foot
lengths (though some suppliers may stock shorter lengths in 1-foot
increments). It can be cut to any length with a hacksaw and a miter
box. The miter box is essential because it allows you to hold the
pipe while making square cuts. Use a 24-tooth blade for cutting,
then remove all burrs with a half-round file, or a reamer. It is
important to remove the burrs because they reduce the flow of water
in the pipe.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting pipe with a hacksaw can be tedious. It's easier and more
efficient to use a pipe cutter for this chore. The pipe cutter is a
clamp-like device with one movable jaw and a round cutting wheel
mounted on the fixed jaw. The tool makes clean, square cuts without
flattening or denting the pipe.
</P>
<P>
   To use the pipe cutter, clamp it on the pipe until the cutting
wheel bites into the metal. Rotate the tool around the pipe. After
each rotation, tighten the movable jaw so the cutting wheel digs
deeper. Continue this procedure until the pipe is cut. Be sure to
remove all burrs around the cut.
</P>
<P>
   Copper pipe can be joined with special fittings, but these are
expensive. It is more economical to join pieces of copper pipe by
sweat-soldering them together. The only tools and materials needed
are fine steel wool or emery cloth, non-acid soldering flux,
lead-free solder and a propane torch.
</P>
<P>
   Start by cleaning the end of the pipe carefully with the emery
cloth. Clean the surface at least 1/2 inch beyond the shoulder of
the fitting. Next, clean the inside of the fitting. It is essential
that the metals parts be bright and clean, otherwise the solder
will not adhere. The cleaning operation should only remove surface
dirt and shine the metal; too much abrasion could increase the gap
between the pieces and weaken the joint .
</P>
<P>
   Apply a coating of flux to the pipe end and to the inside of the
fitting. The flux is important because it keeps the metal parts
from oxidizing when the heat is applied.
</P>
<P>
   Place the fitting over the pipe end. Twist it back and forth to
spread the flux evenly inside the joint, then align it to the
required angle. Do not touch the cleaned surfaces when you join the
pipe and fitting.
</P>
<P>
   Light the torch and, keeping the flame in motion, heat the
fitting. As the fitting heats up, it will also heat the pipe by
conduction. Hold the solder in your free hand away from the flame.
When the fitting and pipe are heated enough to melt the solder,
touch the solder to the joint. As the solder melts, capillary
action will pull it into the joint around the fitting. Remember, it
is the hot metal that melts the solder, not the torch.
</P>
<P>
   Since copper conducts heat readily, it is possible that heat
generated when you are assembling one fitting can travel along the
pipe to another fixed fitting and melt the solder in that joint.
You can prevent this by wrapping nearby joints with wet rags.
</P>
<P>
   When working on existing plumbing, always shut off the water and
drain the system before heating the pipes.
</P>
<P>
   While sweat soldering is relatively easy, it can be hazardous
because you are working with an open flame _ often in close
quarters. It is important to take every precaution against fire.
Set up shields, either metal or other fire-resistant material, to
protect the walls around the pipe. Keep a fire extinguisher or
bucket of water handy in case of accidental fire.

THE LURE OF THE UNDERGROUND

   The lure of secret and mysterious underground places has always
had a hold on some people. For all the online Indiana Joneses out
there, the Web offers plenty of places, from ancient to modern, to
poke around in without getting too grimy or chased by angry guards.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want an early historical start, the Christian
catacombs of Rome are featured in a Web site
 &UR; (www.catacombe.roma.it/welcome.html) &LR;  that takes visitors on an
informative tour filled with pictures and text in six different
languages. The catacombs were the underground cemeteries of Rome's
early Christians, from the second to the fifth century. They
contain miles of crypts and tombs, but the Web site points out that
the catacombs were not used as secret hiding places for persecuted
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is only a fiction taken from novels or movies,'' the text
says. It notes that the catacombs were sometimes used for the
clandestine celebration of the Eucharist.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``catacombs'' may call to mind Paris and its enormous
burial caverns near the Denfert-Rocherau stop on the Metro.
Formerly stone quarries and underground galleries, the French
catacombs _ much younger than the Roman ones _ are less than 200
years old. The Catacombs  &UR; (www.mygale.org/11/ &LR; 
 &UR; houze/english/presentation.html)  &LR; offers a nice mix of history and
anecdotes on the place and is also available to read in French.
</P>
<P>
   Thrill seekers and party hounds have begun hanging out in the
Parisian necropolis, and a small Web page
 &UR; (www.mygale.org/01/lafouine/ &LR;   &UR; kata/htmleng.intro.htm)  &LR; celebrates
these ``Cataphyles.'' Places that were once used as shelter by the
homeless and members of the French Resistance during World War II
are now the site of a subterranean subculture (complete with art,
social gatherings and graffiti) that has been evolving over the
last 15 years, the Web site says. The Paris police play cat to the
Cataphyles' mouse.
</P>
<P>
   An adventure with the Cataphyles is told on Paris Underground in
a first-person narrative by Murray Battle with plenty of pictures
to illustrate the journey, crawling through the Catacombs
 &UR; (www.infiltration. &LR;   &UR; org/catacomb.htm) &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   If modern archeology with a little chutzpah appeals to you,
Infiltration's main site  &UR; (www.infiltration. &LR;   &UR; org)  &LR; offers to take
you through several off-limits areas around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Proclaiming itself ``the zine about going places you're not
supposed to go,'' Infiltration concerns itself with urban
exploration, providing surreptitious virtual trips through
passageways found in Toronto's subway system and several buildings
around town.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a fascinating section devoted to roaming through
steam tunnels on college campuses. Infiltration includes a link to
the College Tunnels page
 &UR; (members.tripod.com/tunnels/tunnels.html) &LR; , which educates its
readers about the hobby but warns them, ``Tunneling is a very
dangerous activity and you do so at your own risk.'' For those who
are curious, the page offers links to information on tunnels at 52
major universities.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of the first purchases Jim McGinn's father made
after the family moved from Glasgow to New York in 1956 was a
shortwave radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``He found the BBC World Service, and every Saturday we'd be
glued to the radio,'' the younger McGinn recalled fondly. Members
of the family listened for results from the Scottish soccer leagues
and especially their beloved Celtic Football Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``If even the word Celtic was mentioned, there would be a glow
to our faces,'' McGinn said.
</P>
<P>
   The technology is more sophisticated today, but the passion is
still elemental. Soccer, the most international sport, has
followers all over the globe, a large percentage of them far from
the teams that stir their deepest loyalties.
</P>
<P>
   If you are an American supporter of Manchester United, perhaps
the most widely marketed soccer team in the world, you will not
have much of a problem keeping up with your team. The English
Premier League, the major league of English soccer, has a
pay-per-view hookup with a game available weekly in the United
States, and Fox Sports World does a Sunday evening highlights
program that invariably features one of the glamour teams like
Manchester United, Arsenal or Liverpool. Similarly, followers of
the Italian Serie A, German Bundesliga or Spanish Liga Primera,
equivalents of the Premier League, can count on fax and ESPN to
provide weekly action.
</P>
<P>
   But for fans whose teams have slipped a little out of the
limelight, or whose preferred league is a notch below those exalted
heights, a little ingenuity is required, along with, if possible,
an up-to-date computer setup.
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of the Internet, e-mail lists and chat rooms,
Liverpool fans can follow their team from Singapore, and displaced
Glaswegians can root for Celtic from a bar on the Upper West Side
of Manhattan. An expatriate Spaniard living in London continues a
third-generation affair with Real Madrid at the same time that a
group of Greek-Americans in Boston worship AEK Athens. Major soccer
leagues all over the world began play in August, and fans are
scrambling to follow the action.
</P>
<P>
   Jim McGough, a Web developer in San Francisco, has followed the
Amsterdam team Ajax since he became friends with a Dutch graduate
student nearly a decade ago. When ESPN carried Dutch First Division
games, the dominant Ajax team was often featured. But those
telecasts stopped two seasons ago, and McGough had to look
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all hooked up through an Amsterdam-based list-serve for
fans of the team,'' he wrote via e-mail. ``I started a Web page
called Ajax USA  &UR; (www.ajax-usa.com/ajax) &LR; , and that quickly turned
into more of a supporters' club.'' He added, ``It was amazing how
many people joined our club, even though we offered no real
benefits and had no official association with AFC Ajax. People were
just desperate to `belong' to Ajax in some way.'' His club now has
more than 1,000 members in about 20 countries.
</P>
<P>
   McGough sends e-mail messages to the members after every game
with the score and a summary, and, relying on the Ajax list-serve,
he posts news and gossip daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second time I went to Amsterdam, I stayed with some
friends whom I had never met before, and whom I only knew through
Ajax USA and the Ajax list-serve,'' McGough wrote. ``I simply sent
e-mail asking if they would put me up for two weeks, arrange for
match tickets and show me the sights, and they agreed. It worked
out great, and they have since been to stay with us here in
California.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane White, a Tottenham Hotspur fan, runs one of several e-mail
lists dedicated to that team, based in London. At her job at the
Columbia University Center for the Humanities, she follows the team
on the site for Soccernet  &UR; (www.soccernet.com) &LR; , which updates
scores throughout games. For the World Cup, she added to her
desktop a soccer-only news feed from  &UR; www.worldsoccernews. &LR;   &UR; com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   In London, Gonzalo San Martin carries on a love affair with Real
Madrid that he inherited from his father and grandfather. He has an
elegant Web site, in Spanish and English, on the legendary team
 &UR; (www.yrl.co.uk./gonzalo/ &LR;   &UR; rm/rm.html) &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``I regularly get e-mails from all around the world because of
my Web page,'' he wrote in an e-mail note. ``They write from places
like Thailand, Morocco, Israel and Russia, not to mention most of
the rest of Europe, the States and South America.''
</P>
<P>
   Many teams have made their radio broadcasts available on the
Internet through Real Audio technology. The Web site Soccer on the
Radio  &UR; (sefl.satelnet.org/philsoc/socrad) &LR;  is devoted to listing
and linking to several dozen other online broadcasting sites, and
it also tells where to find conventional radio broadcasts of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of teams whose match broadcasts are not found on the
Internet can find some solace in the existence of IRC, or Internet
Relay Chat, and chat rooms. Chat rooms devoted to a single soccer
team will often offer a typed-in relay of the game action courtesy
of a dedicated (some might say masochistic) local follower who sits
by a television with a computer at the ready for the benefit of the
less fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   The followers of Liverpool, a Premier League team, have gone the
IRC route one better. Richard Lloyd and other Liverpool fans
maintain a site dedicated to the team &UR; (anfield.merseyworld.com) &LR; 
and have developed software called Commentator, which enables
someone not only to type in running play-by-play accounts but also
to keep complete team lineups on screen with a running game clock
and to note important events (fouls, shots on goal, goals and so on
) in a separate field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commentator is cheaper (and uses far less bandwidth) than Real
Audio, works on ANY platform that has Java and is better than a
chat room or IRC commentary,'' Lloyd said via e-mail. ``One clear
problem of IRC or chat-room game replay is knowing the team lineup,
score, cards, game events and elapsed time without having to either
ask continually in the chat room or have a refresh timer on the Web
page (which is inefficient and heavily loads the Web server).''
</P>
<P>
   The increased availability of satellite programming in bars,
restaurants and clubs has made it easier for fans to congregate at
the nearest friendly watering hole that is willing to dedicate at
least one screen to soccer on a Saturday morning. McGinn's group,
the New York Celtic Supporters Club, takes over Boomer's Sports Bar
in Manhattan several times a month in the fall and winter to watch
the Glasgow side.
</P>
<P>
   For some fans, though, there is a downside to the growing
accessibility of soccer news. Peter Spenser, a 44-year-old
management consultant, put it bluntly. Sitting glumly in
Kavanaugh's, at Third Avenue and 33d Street, waiting for the
satellite broadcast of a Tottenham Hotspur game to begin, he talked
about the team's recent decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came to the United States from London 17 years ago,
Spurs were playing well, but I couldn't keep up with them,''
Spenser said. ``Now I check Soccernet, the Spurs Web site, my
e-mail, all day. The explosion of new technology has made it
possible for me to really suffer.''

A FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT REFLECTS ON TECHNOTRICKS ON, AND OFF, THE
ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the old days, travel meant getting away. Now it means going,
but not getting away. To explore the Third World may still mean
lugging a backpack, but inside it you can have a trove of high-tech
devices that tether you as securely to the first world as a ball
and chain.
</P>
<P>
   When I set off for the hinterlands these days, I sometimes still
pull out the same dark blue Eagle Creek backpack that I used 15
years ago as a graduate student. But in those days I would simply
step out of some Asian or African airport, put on my cool
sunglasses, heave the backpack onto my shoulders and disappear for
five weeks at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Now the backpack is the same, but everything in it has changed.
The most important transformation is that it can now serve as a
communications center.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece is my Thrane &AMP; Thrane satellite phone, which I
can set up in about 30 seconds in the middle of a jungle clearing.
Satellite phones are expensive _ one costs about $3,000, which
doesn't include charges of about $2.50 a minute for calls _ but
they allow voice and data transmission from any place on the planet
outside the polar zones.
</P>
<P>
   When the light plane I was riding in lost the use of its
controls in Uganda last year and was coming down for a crash
landing without even being able to dump its fuel first, I braced
myself in crash position and grimly contemplated the expected
fireball _ then realized that I might have time before the crash to
pull out the satellite phone and use my laptop to buy extra life
insurance off the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen years ago, satellite phones were suitcase-size
contraptions with huge antennas, and they required a large amount
of electrical power. But in the current generation, a satellite
phone is the size of a laptop computer and works from a battery
pack. In contrast with cellular phones, which function only if a
ground station is nearby, a satellite phone can be used almost
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   You point a satellite phone at the sky, turn it on and rotate it
until you find the satellite that best serves the area. The line is
slow for data, 2,400 baud, and there is a slight lag in
conversations as the signals go up to the satellite and back, but
the battery will give you nearly two hours' worth of phone
conversation or an hour of e-mail transmission.
</P>
<P>
   When the battery goes out on my Thrane &AMP; Thrane, a solar panel
is available to recharge it. But for juice, I always pack a
portable power inverter that I picked up from Radio Shack.
</P>
<P>
   It is a device that plugs into a car's cigarette lighter at one
end and offers a regular 110-volt electrical outlet at the other
end. So as long as there is a car around, I can power up my laptop
and satellite telephone _ and electric shaver.
</P>
<P>
   (A cautionary tale: In a remote part of Congo, I once ran a
satellite phone from a car battery and then tried to drive off. But
the phone had drained the battery dead, and I was on a dirt road in
guerrilla-held territory in the middle of a civil war. The moral of
the story is to always keep the engine running when you borrow from
a car battery.)
</P>
<P>
   For following the news, I also carry a little Sony shortwave
radio, scarcely bigger than a cigarette pack. I've been through
many versions, and although my current one is a neat digital
version that also functions as an alarm clock, the key element is
an accompanying antenna with a clip at one end so it can be hooked
onto a hotel curtain or window. Good shortwave reception depends
not on a $300 radio but on a $10 antenna.
</P>
<P>
   My communications center also includes a couple of phone cables,
including a device called a spider that has a United States-style
telephone plug at one end for my laptop and divides into eight arms
with plugs for different kinds of phone systems at the other.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since a desperate struggle with a phone system in Macao
many years ago, I also carry alligator clips to connect my modem
directly into the phone cables if all else fails: I unscrew the
phone outlet from the wall and poke around until I find the phone
wires.
</P>
<P>
   For all this reconnaissance work on phone lines, I carry around
a little screwdriver set that I got in Korea a decade ago to take
apart the telephones in the Chosun Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The screwdrivers have stubby ends so airline security officials
will not confiscate them as weapons, and I also carry folding
scissors and a miniature pocketknife that airlines regard as less
threatening than my Swiss Army knife. I avoid checking bags on
flights, so that makes it impossible to carry anything that bothers
the people who cluster around airport X-ray machines.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out my communications center is a convertible plug set
that I got for about $10 at Heathrow Airport to deal with wall
outlets in various foreign countries and a small Radio Shack device
that plugs into the phone line at one end and my little tape
recorder at the other, allowing me to tape phone interviews. (It's
the same device that Linda Tripp used, I believe, but unlike Ms.
Tripp, I get permission before I tape calls.)
</P>
<P>
   Moving from the communications center to the bedroom, I carry
some low-tech gadgetry in the Third World to make sure that I
survive long enough to play with the high-tech toys. I sleep inside
a sheet sack, which is a bit like a sleeping bag except that it is
made out of a tightly woven sheet and keeps out bedbugs, and I pack
a mosquito net as well. My current version is a wonderful device
that folds up around my face like a little tent.
</P>
<P>
   I once had to bivouac in Africa in an abandoned mud hut that
turned out to have a wasp nest directly above my cot. My mosquito
coils evidently had an effect on the wasps because they dropped on
me all night, sick but not dead.
</P>
<P>
   I ended up covered by a layer of squirming wasps, but with my
sheet sack and mosquito net, I ended up as snug as a bug in a rug.
Well, OK, as snug as a human covered with wasps, which is to say
not so snug at all, but it could have been worse.
</P>
<P>
   Since catching malaria last year, I have been on the warpath
against mosquitoes. So now I also pack disgusting insect repellents
that have a hefty concentration of DEET and also a substance called
Duranon to treat clothing, keeping insects away for two weeks even
after the clothing is washed.
</P>
<P>
   In malarial areas, I also take a nifty Japanese thingamajig (not
available anywhere else, as far as I know) that snaps onto your
belt and holds a burning mosquito coil, which puffs merrily as you
walk around.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   None of that is effective against rats and roaches, which are my
bane. I once settled into a cheap hotel room in Bangladesh and
found it infested with thousands of two-inch cockroaches crawling
all over the bed and floor. I packed a small can of roach spray on
my next Bangladesh trip. But that was a luxury and in any case,
I've stopped carrying sprays ever since an embarrassing incident in
a tiny airport in southwestern China.
</P>
<P>
   When a security guard there found my spray deodorant, he held it
up before a throng of hundreds of curious Chinese and asked me
suspiciously what I intended to use it for.
</P>
<P>
   Deodorant is unknown in rural China, and the term for deodorant
in Chinese literally means ``chemical to drive away the stink.'' So
it was a bit awkward to explain to the crowd that I used such a
chemical on myself and that otherwise I would begin to smell.
Hundreds of pairs of eyes gazed at me in fascination, and noses
began twitching curiously. I have never again packed a spray can in
my carry-on luggage.
</P>
<P>
   My kitchen is the smallest section of the pack. It consists
simply of an iodine dropper to purify water _ a few drops are
supposed to kill even amoebic dysentery _ and a military-issue can
opener, a great little gadget scarcely bigger than a paper clip. I
gave my first one away to a Bedouin who treated me to dinner over
his campfire in the Sinai many years ago, and I've gone through
several since then.
</P>
<P>
   For times when the electricity goes out, I pack a couple of
small candles and matches. Then there's always either a
miniflashlight or a slightly larger flashlight that converts into a
lantern.
</P>
<P>
   Moving from the office, bedroom and kitchen to the front door, I
prefer a profusion of low-tech devices to make sure that my pack
stays in my possession. In India a dozen years ago, I once lost the
key to the minipadlock on my pack and was horrified to discover how
easily I could jimmy it open with a screwdriver.
</P>
<P>
   So I went to a locksmith and bought a dozen much stouter
padlocks that all take the same key, and now I use those hefty
locks and keep a few copies of the key secreted here and there. I
also carry a bicycle lock and run it through the padlocks and then
lock it to something sturdy if I am in a cheap hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The silliest place to carry money and a passport, of course, is
in one's pocket or a purse, but I also lost my faith in the common
waist and neck pouches after running into a Canadian man on a train
in the Ivory Coast. A big hefty man (he was a professional
basketball player), he had been set upon when he had first stepped
onto the train. The first thing the robbers did was to rip open his
shirt and grab the waist pouch containing his money and passport.
The problem with those pouches is that they leave a visible bulge
under one's shirt and tell thieves where to look.
</P>
<P>
   So in bad areas, I carry my passport and other essentials in a
leather pouch that loops around my belt and then slips down against
my leg on the inside of my trousers. It's almost impossible to
detect unless somebody pulls down my pants, which has not happened
so far (even if some drunken Ghanaian soldiers, in the course of
robbing us, once made a traveling companion pull off his shoes and
socks so they could check for hidden money).
</P>
<P>
   In unstable areas, I also wear a nifty black leather belt that
looks like any other but has a zipper on the inside; I keep two
$100 bills folded there. Then, even if everything is stolen, I can
at least pay any lifesaving bribes and get transportation to an
American embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Another essential is a decoy wallet because it is only polite
when you encounter an angry soldier with a machine gun to allow
yourself to be robbed. So I have a wallet in my hip pocket with
some local currency and a library card for identification (it's
amazing what checkpoints an English-language library card will get
you through). The problem is that it is easy to forget that the
wallet is just a decoy, meant to be taken.
</P>
<P>
   One time when I was walking with a friend through a slum in
Lima, Peru, a mugger grabbed my friend's decoy wallet, which had
only about $10 in it. We should have let the mugger take it, but
instead we wrestled around on the ground with the mugger as a crowd
gathered. Finally the mugger ran off empty-handed, and a mysterious
man emerged and began firing a pistol in the general direction of
the fleeing thief.
</P>
<P>
   We had not counted on guns, and the episode had escalated much
more quickly than we had expected. We felt rather foolish
explaining that there had been almost nothing in the wallet, and I
suppose that the incident illustrated the importance of something
even more important than a low-tech decoy wallet or a high-tech
satellite phone: non-tech common sense.

<P>
   There has been much discussion of Monica Lewinsky's thong
underwear.
</P>
<P>
   The Starr report says: ``In the course of flirting with
(President Clinton), (Lewinsky) raised her jacket in the back and
showed him the straps of her thong underwear, which extended above
her pants.''
</P>
<P>
   We called a local Seattle lingerie boutique and was assured that
thong bikini straps--unlike traditional bikini straps--often
continue above the waistband of a woman's trousers. (We also called
his local Victoria's Secret, but the manager thought us a pervert
and hung up.) In other words, Monica was surely being saucy, but
she didn't do anything more than raise her jacket and blouse flaps
to reveal her lower back.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a good reason she didn't disrobe. Contrary to the
Starr report, Lewinsky's newly released testimony suggests that
there were other people in the room! (The room was Leon Panetta's
office, the occasion was a pizza party for a staffer's birthday.)
</P>
<P>
   Her Aug. 11 testimony says ``no one else in the room could have
seen (the thong); this was something that Lewinsky learned to do
when she was having an affair with Andy Bleiler.'' (Bleiler, in
case you've forgotten, is the married high-school drama coach with
whom she dallied.)
</P>
<P>
   In other words, showing the thong isn't a prudish way of saying
that Lewinsky stripped for the president. Showing the thong was a
lewd trick Lewinsky knew, something just slightly more salacious
than a suggestive wink.

A FINE MESS!
</HEADLINE>
  By BRUCE GOTTLIEB 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some people are looking for a way to punish President Clinton
that's tougher than censure but not as tough as impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   On ABC's ``This Week,'' former Clintonite George Stephanopoulos
proposed a fine--Clinton should reimburse the government for the
cost of the Lewinsky portion of Starr's investigation (the part for
which his dissembling was responsible).
</P>
<P>
   Is this suggestion serious? Is it kosher?
</P>
<P>
   Stephanopoulos certainly meant to be serious and subsequent
articles from the New York Times, Baltimore Sun, and the Associated
Press treated his proposal respectfully. A financial penalty might
assuage outraged voters in a way that Clinton's many apologies have
not.
</P>
<P>
   There is precedent. In 1997 Congress fined Newt Gingrich
$300,000 as punishment for lying about ethics violations. Speaker
Gingrich agreed to accept a loan from Bob Dole, who was by then
employed by a Washington lobbying firm. Many pundits pronounced
this deal a conflict of interest, even though Dole pledged not to
lobby his well-connected debtor. Coincidentally, on Monday Gingrich
announced he doesn't need Dole's money since the latest Gingrich
book is selling better than expected.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with the fine idea is how Clinton could be expected
to pay it--on top of his lawyers' bills, etc. The fine
Stephanopoulos proposes would be something like $4 million. It's
hard to think of any way the president, or even the ex-president,
could raise that kind of money without controversy and objection
from the very critics the fine is supposed to assuage.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, a fine can only work as part of a plea bargain.
Clinton must agree to it. If Congress attempted to impose a fine
against his will, Clinton could call it a ``bill of attainder.''
That is a law imposing punishment on an individual without trial,
and it is prohibited by the Constitution. But Bill Clinton is the
only person with the legal standing to dispute a fine levied
against Bill Clinton. If he goes along, no one else can object.
</P>

   &UR; HOME &LR;  (``l'' code)
</P>
<P>
   CONSTRUCTION-MANAGER (New York) _ Randy Polumbo is not an
interior decorator. Or an architect. Or a general contractor. In a
way, he is all of them _ the owner's eyes and ears on the job. He
is one of a relatively new breed of home improvement specialists: a
construction manager. By Tracie Rozhon.

<P>
   LARSEN-TEXTILE-DESIGN (Undated) _ Jack Lenor Larsen was ready
for his close-up. ``It's nun's veiling,'' he said of the sheer,
black, collarless suit he was wearing that summer day, ``designed
by my friend Massimo Vignelli. It's cooler than cotton.'' Larsen is
a man of the cloth, but it's not like that. He is possibly the most
accomplished textile designer living, certainly one of the most
innovative and influential of the second half of the twentieth
century.

<P>
   NY-REAL-ESTATE (New York) _ Hundreds of sellers of co-ops and
condominiums dropped their prices last week, according to
principals of two of Manhattan's best-known real estate companies,
the Halstead Property Co. and the Corcoran Group, who call these
the first such recognizable drops since the early 1990s. By Tracie
Rozhon.

</P>
<P>
   CORPORATE-LOGOS (Undated) _ Corporate logos are supposed to be
universal and unchanging, their color, size and placement spelled
out in corporate-image policy books. From the International
Business Machines Corporation to Federal Express, the power to
imprint everything from a headquarters building to business cards
has been a sign of corporate efficiency and organization, implying
a power and dependability customers could trust. But lately logos
show signs of softening up and growing more playful. By Phil
Patton.
</P>
<P>
   NY-MADISON-AVE (New York) _ In retailing, the young, the trendy
and the new have tended to go downtown, to Tribeca, Soho and
Chelsea. So it's nice to see new life appearing this season on
Madison Avenue, especially that stretch between 79th Street and
86th Street. By Marianne Rohrlich.

   OFFICE-CUBICLES (Undated) _ Anyone who works in a cubicle knows
that its shroudlike isolation bears no resemblance to real privacy.
But it may come as a surprise that the people who design today's
office systems agree that cubicles are long overdue for a makeover.
By Julie Iovine.

BOTTLE YOUR SALSA? A NEW KIND OF KITCHEN MAKES IT POSSIBLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you ever wondered whether you could cash in on your
favorite aunt's rich, creamy cheesecake, or maybe ride to the top
of the culinary world with your secret barbecue sauce?
</P>
<P>
   If only you had a place to prepare it _ a commercial kitchen
that could pass all the health department requirements. If there
was just someone available to help, to explain costs and pricing
and marketing, it might work.
</P>
<P>
   John Echols, a Port Arthur dentist, also wondered.
</P>
<P>
   When Echols was in dental school on the East Coast, he suffered
through a rather bland dinner party on Martha's Vineyard. It was
good food, he said, but bland.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a couple of lawyers there, and a couple of doctors.
They all said they wondered what the poor people were eating,''
Echols remembered. ``I told them the ones I knew were eating better
than we were. They were eating spicy Cajun food and rich pecan
pies.''
</P>
<P>
   Echols began thinking of all the good food around his Port
Arthur home. He asked himself how local people could prepare those
foods and maybe make a couple of dollars in the bargain. How could
they do it without investing in a commercial kitchen?
</P>
<P>
   The answer: an incubator kitchen _ a commercial-grade kitchen
open to individuals on an hourly basis. A place to hatch new
products and new ideas.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, there were only a few in the country: in Seattle,
in Denver, and in Sand Point, Idaho, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came back to Texas after school, and another guy and I
started talking about how this lady had good pies, and another made
great cookies, another had great tamales. We thought there must be
some kind of way we can put them together,'' Echols said.
</P>
<P>
   Working through Southeast Texas Community Development, a private
nonprofit group, Echols and others discovered the concept of
incubators. Now, he expects an incubator kitchen to be open in Port
Arthur by spring.
</P>
<P>
   There is no one floor plan for these communal kitchens. Echols'
group found an old restaurant that will be refurbished. Individuals
who think they can market their favorite cakes and pies, salsas and
dips, can rent the kitchen space for about $8 to $12 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen will be open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   Potential clients want to make barbecue sauces, spice mixes,
herbed vinegars and oils, and even a few seafood entrees such as
shrimp-filled crepes. A few orchards want to turn out jellies and
jams.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Arthur kitchen will be certified by the federal Food
and Drug Administration. No meat-based products will be allowed,
but seafood can be used in specific cases, Echols said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now structuring a partnership with the local community
college,'' he said. ``We will use one of their dietitians, who will
counsel people on how to prepare their foods and how to price their
products.''
</P>
<P>
   Echols said the school, about 10 blocks from the kitchen, will
also work with clients on marketing.
</P>
<P>
   With any luck, he won't have to be without his regional cuisine
again. With any luck, the idea might spread.  &QL;

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Home is where your wife says it is
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was sitting at a bookstore cafe, nursing a bran muffin and a
mug of milk. I couldn't help noticing the young couple at the next
table who were in the process of ruining their lives.
</P>
<P>
   They were poring over three thick books of house plans that
obviously they'd just bought. Lots of house plans. Lots of luck.
</P>
<P>
   Young men, don't buy into the lie that home is where the heart
is.
</P>
<P>
   In matters of the home, a woman is heartless.
</P>
<P>
   There are any number of things a husband and wife can agree on,
and though none happen to come to mind at this particular moment, I
can tell this much _ a house isn't one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Most men would be happy with a cabin in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   Most women aren't happy unless they have a mansion on a hill.
</P>
<P>
   Between the two, there's a lot of misery.
</P>
<P>
   I've been married 33 years. In that time we've owned half a
dozen different houses.
</P>
<P>
   Of those six, there was only one that I loved.
</P>
<P>
   Guess which one my wife hated.
</P>
<P>
   This was a house built of cedar and stone. The roof was gleaming
metal. The front porch was L-shaped. The back deck looked out over
a creek and into the woods beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   From the road you would have thought it was a farmhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, you would have thought it was a mountain ski lodge.
</P>
<P>
   The walls reached up almost two stories. The exposed beams were
like something akin to redwoods. There was a stone fireplace the
size of a Suburban.
</P>
<P>
   Out back on a rim of the creek I'd built a small cabin. That's
where I wrote. A wooden walkway ran from the cabin's front porch to
the back deck of the house.
</P>
<P>
   I was never happier. My wife was never more miserable.
</P>
<P>
   I had ruined her life. That's what she told me. Every day,
that's what she told me.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that I'd been miserable in the house we'd had before,
a two-story, white colonial that we'd built in the country club
subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   A banker lived across the street. A couple of doctors were
around the corner and down the street. About every other house was
a lawyer's.
</P>
<P>
   The front porch wasn't meant to sit on. The back deck took up
most of the back yard. The No. 11 green was part of the view. When
the wind was right you could hear the golfers cursing.
</P>
<P>
   That was her house at the country club. I sold that house to buy
my house by the woods. I can't remember what I paid for it, but I
paid every day of my life that we lived there.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago we finally compromised. We sold my house and
bought one in town. It's a two-story built in the 1930s,
reminiscent of a French country home. My wife has since had it
painted white.
</P>
<P>
   I no longer work in a cabin out back by a creek. I work in the
cabana next to the swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the art of compromise where houses and wives are
concerned. It's an either-or thing. Either do what she wants or
else.
</P>
<P>
   What's a man to do?
</P>
<P>
   Eat your bran. Drink your milk. Keep your mouth shut.

 &HT;    MIAMI RESIDENTS MAKE MAD DASH TO PREPARE FOR GEORGES
 &HT;    With HURRICANE-GEORGES-0924.
 &HT;    By SHELLEY EMLING 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Wednesday was a bad day for Angela Owens.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was Hurricane Georges aiming its wrath in South
Florida's direction, but her kids had dallied that morning, and
arrived late for school.
</P>
<P>
   Now she looked dangerously near tears after a fruitless search
at a Winn-Dixie supermarket for white bread needed to make peanut
butter-and-jelly sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm edgy, and my kids sense that something is up, so they're
edgy,'' the young mother of two said. ``I mean, all this waiting
and uncertainty can drive a person crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Haunted by memories of Hurricane Andrew, which inflicted $30
billion in damage on South Florida in 1992, residents were
scrambling Wednesday to gather the essentials in preparation for
Hurricane Georges, which pushed menacingly to the northwest off the
eastern coast of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters predicted that Georges could crash into the Florida
Keys as early as Thursday evening or Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   At the Winn-Dixie, even the 10-item express line was 20-shoppers
deep.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was bread lacking, but dog food, paper towels, canned
goods, and other items were in short supply at grocery stores
across Miami.
</P>
<P>
   And tempers flared at hardware stores where anxious homeowners
were fighting to snare a piece of plywood to cover doors and
windows.
</P>
<P>
   At one Ace Hardware store, customers scolded themselves for
waiting until the last minute to shop while standing for hours in
the parking lot. They were allowed inside one at a time only when
someone exited the crowded store.
</P>
<P>
   Some homeowners purchased particle board, a poor substitute for
plywood but all many residents could find.
</P>
<P>
   Other customers waited up to two hours in line to purchase items
such as screws, batteries, and generators.
</P>
<P>
   One angry resident searched in vain for a generator at a Home
Depot store, which had run out of its supply but was expecting a
new shipment at any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``During Andrew, I was without electricity for 12 straight days,
which was a nightmare, and I vowed I'd never let that happen
again,'' said Greg Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now it seems that everyone is out of generators,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even more nervous than Steinberg were residents in Florida City
and Homestead, two communities southwest of Miami and just outside
Everglades National Park, where Andrew hit the hardest, wrecking
80,000 homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to get out as soon as they can even though we
might not get the brunt of the storm,'' said Kim Sovia, president
of the Greater Homestead-Florida City Chamber of Commerce. ``By
early this morning, many people had already put shutters up on
their homes and businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at Milam's Market, Fiona Garcia said she had already
purchased enough food and water to last several days, and was only
venturing out Wednesday to buy last-minute extras such as four
boxes of milk and two packages of oatmeal cookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the frosting on the cake for me,'' she said. ``If
you are not ready by now, you'll never be.''

 &HT;    MIAMI RESIDENTS MAKE MAD DASH TO PREPARE FOR GEORGES
 &HT;    With HURRICANE-GEORGES-0924.

   MIAMI _ Wednesday was a bad day for Angela Owens.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was Hurricane Georges aiming its wrath in South
Florida's direction, but her kids had dallied that morning, and
arrived late for school.
</P>
<P>
   Now she looked dangerously near tears after a fruitless search
at a Winn-Dixie supermarket for white bread needed to make peanut
butter-and-jelly sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm edgy, and my kids sense that something is up, so they're
edgy,'' the young mother of two said. ``I mean, all this waiting
and uncertainty can drive a person crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Haunted by memories of Hurricane Andrew, which inflicted $30
billion in damage on South Florida in 1992, residents were
scrambling Wednesday to gather the essentials in preparation for
Hurricane Georges, which pushed menacingly to the northwest off the
eastern coast of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters predicted that Georges could crash into the Florida
Keys as early as Thursday evening or Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   At the Winn-Dixie, even the 10-item express line was 20-shoppers
deep.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was bread lacking, but dog food, paper towels, canned
goods, and other items were in short supply at grocery stores
across Miami.
</P>
<P>
   And tempers flared at hardware stores where anxious homeowners
were fighting to snare a piece of plywood to cover doors and

LEARNING SPANISH ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By LAURA CASTANEDA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For English speakers, Spanish is among the easiest foreign
languages to learn. But can a software program alone help you
achieve fluency? The answer depends not just on the quality of the
program, the amount of time you spend on it or your natural
affinity for the language. It also has to do with the kind of
student you are.
</P>
<P>
   Some students learn more effectively in the social setting
provided by a classroom or with the instant give-and-take of a
one-on-one tutorial, both of which are impossible to duplicate even
with the most sophisticated and interactive software.
</P>
<P>
   Software can be useful, however, for students who are too shy to
speak a new language in front of others. And because programs are
available in a wide range of prices and allow you to study at your
own pace, they are a useful alternative for those who can't afford
tutors or fit language classes into their schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish is by far the most popular tongue in the
foreign-language CD-ROM market, followed distantly by French,
German and Italian, according to PC Data, a market research
company. Sales of Spanish-language CD-ROM's reached almost $19
million in 1997, compared with only about $7 million for French.
Figures for 1998 show Spanish-language CD-ROM sales at more than
$11 million as of July 31.
</P>
<P>
   A typical Spanish software program asks you to listen to
conversations about specific topics like exchanging money or
shopping. These conversations are followed by vocabulary drills,
grammar reviews, exercises and games intended to reinforce what you
have just heard. Some programs are becoming more interactive,
adding speech-recognition features and online support.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Spanish taught by most of these programs is generic
_ avoiding the language variations that occur from country to
country _ there can be subtle differences. Webster's New World
Spanish Tutor by Macmillan Digital Publishing uses words, slang and
accents that are specific to Spain. Cosmi's Swift Multimedia
Spanish speaks the Spanish spoken in Mexico and has a Mexican flag
icon on every screen.
</P>
<P>
   Language software manufacturers tend to make several programs.
The Learning Company, for example, produces Learn to Speak Spanish,
last year's top-selling Spanish title, which sells for $79.95. The
company also offers two less expensive products: Berlitz Spanish
($49.95) and Spanish for Everyone ($29.95). Higher-priced programs
tend to include multiple CD-ROM's, dictionaries, workbooks and
audio cassettes.
</P>
<P>
   All three products have a speech recognition feature (for
Windows only) that evaluates your pronunciation, compares it with
that of a native speaker and gives you a grade ranging from
``tourist'' to ``native.'' Learn to Speak Spanish can also branch
out in different directions during a conversation, based on your
response to a question. If you're asked how long you'll be visiting
Mexico and you say two weeks, the conversation will go in one
direction. If you say two days, it will go in another.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse Language Systems sells three popular Spanish-language
programs for adults and one for children: Self-Study Spanish ($79),
Smart-Start Spanish ($39.95), Success in Spanish ($19.95) and Kids!
Spanish ($29). The three adult products have speech-recognition
capability. Self-Study Spanish, the company's premium product, also
evaluates pronunciation, but for the purpose of providing the same
sort of feedback you would get from an instructor during a
conversation, congratulating you when you're right or correcting
you when you're wrong.
</P>
<P>
   One caveat: If you decide to use a software program that offers
voice recognition, consider upgrading the computer microphone that
comes with the program. Otherwise, your recordings may sound muddy.
</P>
<P>
   SWIFT MULTIMEDIA SPANISH
</P>
<P>
   (The Cosmi Corp; $14.95; Windows 95.)
</P>
<P>
   Language programs do not come much simpler than Cosmi's Swift
Multimedia Spanish. This budget product, which is aimed at
beginners of all ages, includes just one CD-ROM and a 10-page
user's guide.
</P>
<P>
   Swift Multimedia Spanish begins with a walk through seven rooms
of a house. The idea is to teach you the names of various items in
each room and familiarize you with the correct pronunciation. If
you click on Kitchen, for example, you'll hear a native Spanish
speaker say ``la cocina.'' You can then click on the table and
learn its Spanish name, ``la mesa.'' During each scene, English and
Spanish subtitles are automatically shown in cartoon speech
bubbles, but they can be turned off by clicking a translation bar.
</P>
<P>
   In the next scene, an animated cartoon family (mother, father,
teen-age daughter and young son) and its dog is shown in 15
different scenes arranged in three progressive skill levels. The
first level shows family members at a hotel requesting a room, on
the beach asking about weather conditions, in the bar describing
people and places and on a street corner asking for directions.
</P>
<P>
   In the conversation section, you can choose to see and hear a
scene straight through, or you can break it up so it is played one
sentence at a time. You can also review the vocabulary of a
particular scene and conjugate verbs by dragging and dropping the
word into the correct place before or after the scene has played.
</P>
<P>
   In level two, family members describe classroom objects in a
school, order food in a restaurant, talk about going on vacation
and apply for a job at an office. Level three features scenes in
all seven rooms of the house. As you progress, the automatic
translation offers fewer clues: level two shows Spanish subtitles
only, and level three does not show any.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a review of the Spanish alphabet, numbers and
verbs that is accessible at any time from the home page. But there
were a few glitches in the alphabet section. Although the native
speaker pronounced the ``rr'' sound correctly, the word that was
used as an example _ the northeastern Mexican city of Monterrey _
was misspelled on the screen, and the Mexican city of Oaxaca was
mispronounced (as OY-ha-ka instead of wa-HA-ka).
</P>
<P>
   The animation here is rather crude, but Swift Multimedia Spanish
is very easy to use and is a good, inexpensive choice for those who
are just beginning to learn Spanish and who are relatively new to
using software.

<P>
   WEBSTER'S NEW WORLD
</P>
<P>
   SPANISH TUTOR
</P>
<P>
   (Macmillan Digital Publishing; $49.95; Windows 95.)
</P>
<P>
   Webster's New World Spanish Tutor is designed for novice Spanish
speakers who are very serious about learning a new language. The
package includes two CD-ROM's, a Spanish dictionary, an audio
cassette with an introductory Spanish lesson (and a French lesson _
presumably a marketing ploy) , an instant document translation
program called Accent Duo and lots of games.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Macmillan does not provide a user's guide for
this wealth of material. That is particularly detrimental to the
program, which is not very intuitive. There is an interactive
guided tour, but the explanations are not very clear. But it is
better than nothing, so you should take it before jumping into the
lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Each CD-ROM has eight lessons that focus on specific topics,
like shopping, health or how to ask questions. Each lesson begins
with short conversations. There's no animation; you just listen to
the dialogues and read the Spanish subtitles that appear in speech
bubbles. The conversations whiz by, and there is a fair amount of
slang. (At one point, for instance, a foreign girl is referred to
as a ``guiri.'') You can get an instant translation by clicking on
a word. Dialogues can be replayed in their entirety as many times
as you like, or they can be slowed or broken down sentence by
sentence if you want to check the pronunciation or definition of a
word or phrase. Following the dialogues are three vocabulary
lessons that review the words and phrases you have just heard.
</P>
<P>
   Each lesson ends with at least a half-dozen tests. There is also
a pronunciation exercise in which you are asked to record a phrase
in Spanish compare it with the same phrase spoken by a native
speaker. You are encouraged to repeat the tests as often as it
takes to master them.
</P>
<P>
   Among the best features of this software package are the games
in the Language Arcade section. The games provide a relaxed and
easy way to reinforce the lessons.
</P>
<P>
   The Accent Duo document translation program is handy, especially
for students. This word-processing program helps you translate
English words, sentences or entire documents into Spanish or from
Spanish into English. Translations of individual words and simple
phrases are fairly accurate. Not surprisingly, translations of
longer or more complex sentences are trickier.
</P>
<P>
   The New World Spanish Tutor has a lot to offer. But to get the
most out of it, you need to be comfortable using a computer and
software.
</P>
<P>
   SELF-STUDY SPANISH
</P>
<P>
   (Syracuse Language Systems; $79; Windows 95.)
</P>
<P>
   Self-Study Spanish is based on an online course taught by the
Language Connect Institute, a division of Syracuse Language Systems
that offers distance-learning courses for adults. The program is
designed for students of beginning conversational Spanish and
offers 12 units with 5 lessons each, for a total of 60 lessons. The
package includes four CD-ROM's, two audio cassettes, a Spanish
dictionary, two short workbooks, grammar and usage notes and a
technical manual. Although there's no animation or video in the
lessons, the graphics and drawings used are clear and colorful.
</P>
<P>
   Each unit centers on a specific topic, like dining out, hotel
accommodations or medical needs. The five lessons in each unit
focus on conversation, vocabulary, grammar, speaking and reading.
</P>
<P>
   The first lesson begins with a conversation by native Spanish
speakers. In the unit on social engagements, for example, a friend
brings a gift to a couple and stays for dinner. You can choose to
listen to the conversation straight through, or you can break it up
into phrases or sentences. You also have the option of reading the
conversation in English and in Spanish on the screen as it's being
spoken. The lesson ends with a short grammar and usage review. One
such review focused on the difference between ``muy'' (very) and
``mucho'' (much or many).
</P>
<P>
   Lesson Two focuses on vocabulary. A list of words is displayed
on the screen. Click on a word to hear how it is pronounced. You
can hear the word up to three times in a row or hear the entire
list of vocabulary words, one after another. The program also
features speech-recognition software that allows you check your
pronunciation against that of a native speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson Three is a succinct and clear review of gender and number
for nouns, definite and indefinite articles, agreement of
adjectives, greetings and when they're used, and numbers up to 10.
Each section is followed by exercises.
</P>
<P>
   In Lesson Four, you're asked to listen to a conversation several
times at normal and slow speeds, look at the translations and check
grammar and usage notes. Then you're asked to make a recording both
for evaluation by the program and to encourage you to compare your
accent with those of native speakers.
</P>
<P>
   The final lesson is on reading. You're asked to review text that
is presented in several forms, including an e-mail message, an
advertisement, a menu, an invitation, a brochure and a short
article. Then your comprehension is tested.
</P>
<P>
   The exercises and tests on Self-Study Spanish are among the best
reviewed here because they are short and simple. You can get
instant feedback by clicking on Show Results. Incorrect answers
will be left blank so you can try again. The online Language
Enrichment offers more skill-building exercises, vocabulary lists
and links to Spanish-language Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   A separate CD-ROM called Culture Break lets you explore Hispanic
cultures around the world through videos, photographs and sound.
There is even a special section called Talking Hands that teaches
you the 10 most common hand gestures in Spanish-speaking countries,
including the useful signal for getting something to drink.
</P>
<P>
   LEARN TO SPEAK SPANISH, VERSION 7.0
</P>
<P>
   (The Learning Co; $79.95; Windows 95 and Macintosh.)
</P>
<P>
   Learn to Speak Spanish has earned its place as the nation's
best-selling Spanish-language software program. The package, which
includes three CD-ROM's with 30 lessons, a user's guide, a 146-page
workbook and a practice language audiocassette, takes the most
common-sense, focused approach to teaching Spanish of the programs
reviewed here. It is easy to navigate and is packed with a lot more
video footage than other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Learn to Speak Spanish begins with a useful section called
Basics that teaches the Spanish alphabet, vowel and consonant
sounds, and basic vocabulary words covering areas like numbers,
colors, times and seasons. The Learning Company recommends spending
some time here before tackling the lessons.
</P>
<P>
   The program is highly interactive. If you click on a vowel,
consonant or word, you can hear it pronounced by a native Spanish
speaker, listen to it in a sentence, get a phonetic spelling, read
a translation, record your own voice and _ thanks to speech
recognition _ grade your pronunciation with an on-screen gauge.
</P>
<P>
   The chapters are built around topics like taking a taxi,
shopping for food and planning an evening out. Each chapter begins
with a description of the lesson's learning goals. The three goals
of Chapter 1, for example, are to learn how to exchange money at an
exchange office, ask where something is and use simple, polite
exchanges with strangers.
</P>
<P>
   The first lesson in each chapter is a review of the pertinent
vocabulary. The next section, called Story, reinforces these words
by using them in various cartoon scenes that can be played straight
through or sentence by sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The next section, Action, is essentially the same exercise as
Story. But instead of cartoon scenes, you can watch a video of
native speakers and read cultural notes on screen that provide a
more in-depth explanation of the conversation. Action is followed
by some quick and enjoyable exercises.
</P>
<P>
   The Conversation section uses speech recognition and
conversation branching technologies to let you interact with an
on-screen native speaker. Your responses determine the direction
and outcome of a conversation. So you can have the conversation
several times but get many different outcomes. The branching
technology seems to work better with a top-of-the-line microphone,
and your responses need to be grammatically precise.
</P>
<P>
   The program has other valuable features. A Games section helps
strengthen the language skills you've learned. A crossword puzzle
uses vocabulary words from current and previous chapters, but Go
Fish uses vocabulary words from only the chapter you're currently
studying. Each chapter concludes with a Cultural Movie that
highlights a different aspect of a Spanish-speaking country. The
videos, which include advice to tourists, architecture, and customs
and tradition, use vocabulary and grammar studied in previous
chapters.
</P>
<P>
   With Internet access you can use the Online Connection to get
help from an online language tutor (at no extra charge), get in
contact with other Spanish students and even create a study plan.
If you click Progress on the menu bar, you'll get a graphical
presentation of the lessons you've completed so far.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for sophisticated language software that is
easy to use, Learn to Speak Spanish is the best place to start.

   &UR; A Weed by Any Other Name &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. On a recent trip to Britain, I was captivated by a flower
about which I cannot seem to get any information here: Himalayan
impatiens. This impatiens is clearly related to our weedy wild
yellow-orange Touch-me-not (or jewel weed), but its blossom is much
larger and of a different color. Can you give me any information
regarding it, especially where I might be able to purchase the
plants?
</P>
<P>
   A. Buy them? Well, yes, you can occasionally find them at
nurseries _ I even once bought one myself in Vermont before I
realized that they grow wild in the Northeastern United States and
Canada in moist, shady and not-so-shady spots.
</P>
<P>
   While Impatiens glandulifera, the Himalayan impatiens, is not
native to the United States, it long ago used its high-power
springy seed capsules, like those of its smaller cousin, jewel
weed, to spread itself around. Now fully naturalized, it has nearly
lost any garden status that it might once have had and become just
another weed. I'm glad to hear that the British at least still
appreciate the pink, rose-purple or pinkish-white tubular flowers
of this tall (up to six feet), fleshy annual. A reliable
self-seeder, it will quickly cover an area it likes, but can be
controlled because it pulls up easily.
</P>
<P>
   Some of our own native wildflowers had to go to Europe to be
appreciated, including asters, monarda (bee balm), helenium
(sneezeweed) and Joe Pye weed. Echinacea (cone flower) didn't
become popular here until European nurseries spent years picking
the best selections and then proceeded to send them back to us as
desirable garden plants.
</P>
<P>
   Himalayan jewel weed seeds are available from J.L. Hudson,
Seedsman, Star Route 2, Box 337, La Honda, Calif. 94020; no
telephone listed; catalog, $1. They need several months of cold to
germinate, so plant in the fall or chill in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Other Kiwis &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have heard a lot about hardy kiwis but have no idea whether
their fruit tastes like the common fuzzy ones or is as insipid as
mulberries. I have also heard that they are rampant and aggressive.
Do you have any knowledge of these plants?
</P>
<P>
   A. Hardy kiwi fruit (Actinidia arguta, hardy in Agriculture
Department Zones 4 to 7) and superhardy kiwi fruit (A. kolomikta,
hardy in Zones 3 to 7) are smaller and smoother than their fuzzy
grocery-store cousins. They have a similar taste but are even
sweeter. Hardy kiwi fruit are about walnut-size, while the
superhardy tend to be marble-size. Perhaps as compensation for
their lack of size, both have edible skins to go with their
emerald-green flesh and tiny black seeds. No muss, no fuss. Put a
handful in your pocket and go. (Just be careful how you sit.)
</P>
<P>
   Both species need well-drained, slightly acid soil, light shade,
strong supports and plenty of room. These are twining woody vines.
In their native humid mountain forests in Asia they can grow to be
100 feet long, but in the Northeast 20 to 30 feet is more likely.
Perhaps in embarrassment for being so large, they tend to hide
their fruit under the leaves, so you'll need to hunt a bit at
harvest time. One benefit is that the small, green fruits are
almost completely overlooked by birds. Cats, on the other hand, may
eat the leaves and stems, which make them act a little dopey, like
catnip.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the A. arguta cultivated variety Issai, both male and
female plants are necessary for fruiting. Plant the male within 35
to 40 feet to make it easier on the bees. A. kolomikta typically
starts producing fruit when it is two years old, but A. arguta may
wait until it is three to five. Both species are beautiful foliage
plants, especially A. kolomikta, whose variegated leaves are shades
of pink, white and green. The cultivars A. kolomikta Krupnopladnaya
and A. arguta Ananasnaja are particularly heavy bearers.
</P>
<P>
   Sources for hardy kiwi fruit include Burnt Ridge Nursery, 432
Burnt Ridge Rd., Onalaska, Wash. 98570, (360) 985-2873, free
catalog; and Edible Landscaping, P.O. Box 77, Afton, Va. 22920,
(800) 524-4156; free catalog.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Resistant Phlox &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Last summer, my phlox became so unsightly with mildew that I
decided to pull them from my perennial bed. I wonder if you know of
any new mildew-resistant hybrids?
</P>
<P>
   A. Most fungus diseases are at their worst in rainy weather, so
gardeners are constantly amazed and frustrated to find that
distinctive powdery white coating when there hasn't been a cloud in
the sky. You may have to live with some powdery mildew, but you
shouldn't lose sleep worrying that it will spread across the
garden. Powdery mildew on phlox does not spread to roses or lilacs
(and vice versa) because each of these plants is attacked by a
different member of this fungus family.
</P>
<P>
   It's a large family, full of near and distant relations, but all
of them grow and reproduce similarly. Give them dry leaves, high
humidity and cool nights and they are keen to release spores.
Actual water on the leaves inhibits their reproduction, but a hard
rain or spray from your hose can physically move the fungus onto
fresh, uninfected leaves. And just to make things especially
complicated, as water on the leaves begins to dry and just a very
thin film remains, the fungi use it as a sort of amusement park
water slide to travel to other leaves. You have to admire a fungus
like that.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want to commit yourself to a regimen of regular
preventive spraying with ultrafine horticultural oil, help fight
powdery mildew by making sure your phlox are in full sun and that
there is good air circulation around the plants. A few varieties
are more or less resistant, but two are said by many growers to be
the best _ David (white) and Robert Poore (magenta). Remember,
though, resistance does not mean immunity. Apparently, fungi are
cleverer than phlox.

 By BARBARA WHITAKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shopping for an apartment in New York City while living in the
Netherlands could be difficult _ particularly in a hot market in
which properties often sell as soon as they come on the market,
sometimes for more than the asking price. But Gary Ensana and David
Vickrey found a way to bridge the intercontinental divide.
</P>
<P>
   They bought their apartment in the Murray Hill neighborhood
without setting foot in it, after a virtual walk-through courtesy
of digital pictures provided through e-mail by Scott Moore, a
Corcoran Group real estate agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a substitute for being in New York and being able to
go on a moment's notice,'' said Ensana, noting that he and Vickrey
had been familiar with the building where they eventually bought an
apartment. ``But given the fact that we were on the other side of
the ocean, it at least made it possible to shop for a place.''
</P>
<P>
   While most home buyers still step through the front door before
putting their life savings into a home, the Internet is changing
the way real estate is bought and sold. Real estate sites, still in
the early stages of development, have become an invaluable source
for sorting through information ranging from how to pick a
neighborhood and a property to how to get the best mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has great potential,'' said Andy Sernovitz, president of
the Association of Interactive Media, a nonprofit trade association
for businesses that use the Internet. ``What the Web can deliver
matches what you have to do anyway, but it does it better.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, potential house buyers are gaining more control of
the house-hunting process. At the heart of the change is where
consumers look for real estate listings and how they approach the
task of shopping for a new home.
</P>
<P>
   For the people who do much of their research before setting foot
in a real estate office, the days of going out with a real estate
agent and driving around neighborhoods to look at houses chosen by
the realtor are largely gone.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate services on the Web are highly competitive. They
became even more competitive in July when Microsoft entered the
market with its multifaceted Home Advisor site
(www.homeadvisor.com). That site can be seen as a direct competitor
to Realtor.com (www.realtor.com), the Web site of the National
Association of Realtors. Realtor.com has more than 1.2 million
listings, generally regarded as the most on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft scares the daylights out of everybody,'' Sernovitz
said. ``It's assumed that if Microsoft gets into your business,
you're in big trouble.'' But Sernovitz said he saw it as a good
sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time Microsoft gets into something, they add credibility
to that genre as an online medium.''
</P>
<P>
   Realtors need to look only at the sales of airline tickets on
line _ and the ways the travel agent business has changed as a
result _ to become concerned about what the future holds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big issue in the marketplace today is who is going to be
the point of control in any transaction,'' said Ron Lipstone, a
realtor with Sotheby's International Realty in Los Angeles and a
director of the combined Los Angeles/Westside Multiple Listing
Service. ``Is it going to be the agent? Is it going to be the
lender? Or is it going to be Microsoft?''
</P>
<P>
   While realtors ponder those kinds of issues, newspapers and
magazines, which carry real estate listings, are looking at the
threat to their market. Facing the loss of billions of dollars
nationally, newspapers have taken their listings on line and are
creating alliances with companies holding similar interests.
</P>
<P>
   The Village Voice in New York City, for example, has turned its
classified listings into a daily service, putting advertisements on
line as they come in. Its Web site, www.villagevoice. com, allows
viewers to search for real estate by specifying the number of
bedrooms, geographic area and price range sought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live in a paranoid way,'' said David Schneiderman, publisher
of The Village Voice and president of Stern Publishing, which owns
seven papers across the country. ``We can't afford to lose this.
There are so many different options and players, you don't even
know who you're competing with half the time.''
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, the Internet may have as many as 200,000 real
estate sites, which include Web pages put up by individual realtors
and by real estate companies and associations as well as classified
advertisements posted by publications. Some sites list descriptions
of homes, dimensions and photographs (or, in a few cases, a
360-degree virtual walk-through of the property), details on
realtors and mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
   Others present information on property tax rates, schools and
town amenities and include calculators that allow you to figure out
how much house you can afford.
</P>
<P>
   Such listings are ``a great facilitator,'' said Paul Purcell,
executive vice president of Douglas Elliman in New York. ``It's
amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   The wider access to information can be disconcerting for
realtors. ``The realtor of yesterday was totally in control of
basic information,'' said George Stephens, chairman of the Houston
Association of Realtors. ``Today the consumer is basically
controlling the information.''
</P>
<P>
   Realtors are increasingly running into people like Barbara
Nicholson, who did not turn to a realtor until she had found the
house she wanted to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nicholson, who used the Internet extensively for her move
from Boston to Syracuse two years ago, said her first instinct had
been to ``get on the Net.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quicker, easier and more cost-effective and
time-efficient,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond scrutinizing listings on the Internet, she went to a
number of related sites, investigating mortgages and calculating
cost-of-living differences. She checked out jobs, found the best
price from a moving company and even located a company that would
help her send address-change notifications to publications and
credit-card companies.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Nicholson doesn't view house hunting on the Internet
as a substitute for getting out and seeing houses and neighborhoods
in person, she said it had saved her time by letting her narrow
down her choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had an agent until I found the house I bought,'' she
said. ``In fact, I think the real estate agent was a little
dismayed he didn't have to do anything. I think he thought he
hadn't earned his fee.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nicholson began her shopping on line two years ago by
calling up a search engine and typing in ``real estate.'' While
that provided her with an overwhelming number of sites, few sites
at that time offered anything in Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   The process was also time-consuming because it required
following a number of links. While Ms. Nicholson had the most
success with Realtor.com, numerous sites have been added since
then. And there are now many ways to search for a home, tailoring
the listings according to the desired city, price range, house size
and special features, like fireplaces and swimming pools.
</P>
<P>
   But sorting through those options can be mind-boggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a pile of clutter,'' said Barbara Corcoran, founder
of the Corcoran Group real estate company in Manhattan. Speaking of
the company's Web site, she said: ``We build bridges everywhere we
can. The more bridges we have, the more traffic we have.''
</P>
<P>
   To attract and retain visitors to the Web site, Ms. Corcoran
relies on what she calls ``bells and whistles'' _ 360-degree
virtual-reality walk-throughs, for example, a feature that is
generally available only for a handful of more expensive
properties.
</P>
<P>
   One useful feature of Corcoran's site is its inclusion of
addresses (but no apartment numbers) for most properties it
advertises on the Net. But many real estate agents disapprove of
that practice, saying it could jeopardize homeowners' security, and
do not list addresses on Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Corcoran has seen her company's Internet-related sales _
sales that followed an initial contact with the company through
e-mail _ grow to $60 million in 1997 from $4.9 million in 1995,
when the site began.
</P>
<P>
   The company has also found that its Web site helps many
customers find what they want more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of Corcoran buyers found that the clients who had used
the Internet had spent only a quarter as much time house-hunting as
had other clients.
</P>
<P>
   The clients who did not use the Web spent about four months with
a realtor, on average, and looked at about 21 homes, while the
``Webheads,'' as the survey called them, spent an average of only
one month with a real estate agent and saw only 5 properties before
buying.
</P>
<P>
   The Web can make brokers and sales agents more visible. At
Corcoran, Sarah Bond, a vice president at the company, made a
valuable contact with a British client who saw a profile of her on
the Internet and selected her because she rode a vintage bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Frankovic, an associate broker with Windermere Real Estate
in Spokane, Wash., has taken on the persona of Garlic Bob on his
Web site. Frankovic, who was forced to eat garlic sandwiches as a
child in the hopes of keeping polio at bay, now grows acres of the
stuff. His Web site includes a photograph of him on an old red
tractor, and he will happily provide information on garlic as well
as on real-estate listings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a goofy picture,'' he said. ``But even if you don't like
me, you'll remember me.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankovic's site was among a dozen that attracted Larry Barnes
when he was looking for a new realtor to sell a house he had left
350 miles behind in Spokane after moving to Whidbey Island, outside
Seattle. Faced with the option of driving back to Seattle or
calling long distance to find a realtor, Barnes turned to the
Internet, narrowing his search by state and city and then looking
at his options.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had I not been on Realtor.com, he would not have found me,''
Frankovic said, noting that his commission on the house had been
well worth the less than $1,000 he spends a year to operate his
Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   Realtor.com, which has been in operation for more than two
years, has the backing of the National Association of Realtors.
Many of its listings come directly from multiple listing services.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Keller, vice president for marketing at Real Select,
which operates the Realtor.com site, says it has a vast database
and takes a direct approach. ``What we're really about is
convenience,'' he said. ``You go to the grocery store more often
than not to pick up milk. That's what we're about, milk.''
</P>
<P>
   While a variety of companies have top-notch sites, most
observers see a battle shaping up between Realtor.com and Home
Advisor, which at this point is lagging behind in listings.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Morris, the lead product manager for Home Advisor, the
Microsoft site, played down the fact that the site is behind
Realtor.com in listings, pointing out that Home Advisor opened with
a preview only in July. He said Microsoft was providing a
comprehensive guide to home buying that helped consumers figure out
how much they could afford and offered neighborhood information and
loan and closing assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said Microsoft was in the business to generate money from
loan origination fees paid by mortgage brokerage companies
associated with the service. ``It allows us to provide a great
service to consumers for free,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With such competition, the bottom line seems to be that realtors
can jump in or face being left out. ``Things are changing,''
Frankovic said. ``The Internet is the way people like to do
business. It's the way I like to do business. You don't have to go
knocking on doors.''

   As rockers lean back to gaze at a planetarium's dome, they see a
glowing image pulsing in time with the drumbeat of the music. A
figure of a hippie wearing neon red bell-bottoms and playing a
quivering electric guitar disintegrates in a loud crash of cymbals
and is replaced by a fluorescent wash of abstract designs that
coalesce into luminous rising steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stairway to Heaven'' by Led Zeppelin has finished to
celebratory fist-pumping by the audience, ending this laser light
show. Today, about 25 years after these midnight displays of pop
culture began, such kaleidoscopic blends of laser art and radio
favorites can still be found in a few dozen places nationwide, like
New York City and Bradenton, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, the laser show era was an outgrowth of the
fascination of a California filmmaker, Ivan Dryer, with the laser
experiments of a physicist in 1970. When Dryer documented the work,
he said, he found himself ``confronted by an eerie sci-fi
environment.'' So Dryer, the unofficial father of laser light
shows, began his own laser productions, including a stint creating
laser effects for an Alice Cooper concert tour.
</P>
<P>
   He started a company called Laser Images in 1971 and began
presenting his own shows, set to recorded music _ he dubbed them
Laserium shows _ in the planetarium at Griffith Observatory in Los
Angeles. While Pink Floyd's ``Dark Side of the Moon'' played, for
example, fans watched a display of laser lights choreographed to
fit the moods and themes of the music.
</P>
<P>
   Laser shows developed during the analog era, long before virtual
reality, three-dimensional computer games and the Web. Now
computers make it easier to create the images that form the
patterns for the shows.
</P>
<P>
   The International Laser Display Association said many companies
now produce laser light shows at planetariums and science centers
across the nation. The shows are also popular internationally, in
places like Taiwan and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Laser light shows are still the high-tech art of smoke and
mirrors. Laser Fantasy of Redmond, Wash., one of the largest
producers, says the process begins when computer animators and
technicians produce a sequence of laser images that are
synchronized with music.
</P>
<P>
   The laser images are produced by sending a laser beam through a
sequence of lenses and mirrors. For a live performance, a
``laserist'' will manipulate these programmed images by increasing
their intensity, mixing colors or sending them through a fog
machine's haze.
</P>
<P>
   During a guitar solo, wavy lines might tremble in time with the
rhythm, or an outlined image of a sailing boat _ reproduced from a
series of computer-generated animation cells _ could float
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like watching a big spirograph that's being improvised
like jazz,'' said Scott Huggins, director of sales for Laser
Fantasy, referring to a popular art toy from the 1970s that is used
to create complex spiral patterns.
</P>
<P>
   The laser display association estimated that the planetarium
market generates $1 million per year in ticket sales but that the
bulk of the laser art business comes from events like product
introductions and Las Vegas stage shows. Dick Sandhaus, co-founder
of the association, estimated that nonplanetarium business
generated tens of millions of dollars per year.
</P>
<P>
   But the business is struggling. In Denver, the Museum of Natural
History was one of the first museums in the country to have laser
light shows, said its media relations manager, Jennifer Gamblin,
but it recently announced that it was discontinuing the shows
because of low attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Everything from Imax theaters to blockbuster special effects in
movies are competing with laser light shows for audiences. ``We're
going to have to adapt or change,'' said Jack Dunn, who focuses on
science centers for the International Laser Display Association.
``Or planetariums will continue to be in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Dryer predicts that the laser shows' future will be in
large-screen formats. The shows of the future, instead of being
shown in planetariums, will be displayed in Imax-style theaters
that will combine traditional films with live laser effects, he
said. Still, for many rock fans, nothing will replace the simple
thrill of laser Zeppelin as it exists today.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Leahy, part of the 20-something and 30-something crowd
attending a recent laser show at the American Museum of Natural
History in New York, said such shows would always be worth the
trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard about this on the radio in Jersey,'' Leahy said
enthusiastically. ``Fifteen minutes later, I was here.''

   &UR; How to Crack The File Code &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can you tell me what some of those three-letter abbreviations
mean on the end of file names in Windows? I would be less afraid of
the system if I knew what some of these cryptic things meant.
</P>
<P>
   A. Knowledge is power, as the saying goes. Those alphabetic
trios, called file extensions, tell the operating system the roles
the files play. The DOS and Windows 3.1, 95 and 98 systems all use
file extensions that follow the old eight-dot-three DOS convention
(eight-letter name with a three-letter file extension separated by
a period).
</P>
<P>
   Some file extensions relating to basic Windows functions include
.SYS, for system files, and .BAT, for batch files, which contain a
series of instructions for the computer to follow. If you see .DAT,
you know you're dealing with a data file; a device driver is
indicated by .DEV (or .DRV), and an .INI file is an initialization
file that holds text information (which can be edited) that Windows
uses to remember your preferences for programs. A command file is
.COM, and an .EXE file is an executable program.
</P>
<P>
   If you can recognize certain file types, making decisions about
deleting files and whether it's really time to call tech support
may come a little easier. Web pages at
stekt.oulu.fi/jon/jouninfo/extension.html and
camalott.com/rebma/filex.html contain thorough lists.

LEAVING THE RIGHT STUFF BEHIND CAN LEAD TO THE BEST OF TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Sept. 27) 
(JT) 
 By JAN BENZEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time was I'd never leave for a trip to the beach without the
shish kebab skewers. No matter how carefully I wrapped them up,
inevitably they'd poke a hole through a canvas suitcase or stab me
when I unpacked. But year after year I dragged them as part of what
I considered essential vacation apparatus, from the back of the
closets into the overstuffed car and out to a rented summer
cottage.
</P>
<P>
   Packing the car was always trying; precious minutes ticked by as
we shoved beach bags into the back seat and balanced bicycles on
the precarious rack, invariably nicking the paint on the trunk.
Sweating and grumpy, Stu and I would take our place in line on the
highway among the herds of cars packed to the rooftops and
bristling with bicycles, sea kayaks, golf clubs, surfboards and
other outsized toys.
</P>
<P>
   Most of ours then usually sat idle as the much-anticipated days
dwindled away. There'd be too much wind or not enough for the kite
or the Wiffle ball. The waves would be too rough or too calm for
the Boogie board. The pounds of books stacking up by the bed all
winter failed to suit my summer mood. A rainy spell ruled out the
exploring I meant to do on the bike.
</P>
<P>
   I kept packing, though, because whether it happened or not, the
skewers promised the prospect of a barbecue on a long summer's
evening, chunks of steak or tuna sizzling on the grill and mingling
with the juices of cherry tomatoes, and peppers garnered from the
farmer's cart on the road home from the beach that afternoon. The
sports equipment was a sign that, although disproportionate amounts
of our lives were lived in front of computer screens, Stu and I
still defined ourselves as the active, outdoorsy type, eager to
paddle a canoe or fling a Frisbee in the waves. We had the stuff to
prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet over the last few years it's dawned on me that traveling
unprepared for every potential activity is not the disaster I once
thought it to be. Plotting may not be the best means to a
spontaneous good time.
</P>
<P>
   Before we had children, we did a fair bit of camping, and had
honed a getaway drill: One of us grabbed the bag with the tent and
sleeping bags, the other the cooking equipment and food, and we
were off to the mountains. One weekend we were able to recruit our
friends Carol and David to join us.
</P>
<P>
   An hour into the Maryland countryside on the way to Virginia,
their car suddenly slowed, and they waved us to the side of the
road. Not only were they tentless (we were counting on good
weather) but each had thought the other had picked up their
sleeping bags. Turning around was considered and rejected; we'd
make do.
</P>
<P>
   That night, when the campfire was nothing but embers, Carol and
David bedded down in a nest of smoke-scented sweatshirts in the
tent. We zipped ourselves into the sleeping bags under the stars
and woke with dew in our hair. We were still hardly roughing it,
but the weekend was more memorable with less baggage.
</P>
<P>
   We were closer to roughing it one late fall weekend on Mount
Greylock in the Berkshires. We shivered all night in the tent, then
went to wash up at the spigot and found the toothpaste had frozen.
That verification of the cold was all we needed to abandon plans
for hiking and send us into Williamstown in search of hardier gear.
We rented cold-impermeable mattresses, strolled around town and had
a civilized dinner. But it was our unpreparedness for the cold _
the frozen Crest _ that made the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Another friend, Sarah, recently showed up in Wyoming for a week
on horseback at a ranch ahead of her luggage. She was slightly
nervous to begin with about a vacation with a group of strangers,
and the delayed suitcase seemed an inauspicious start. But the same
thing had happened when she arrived as a freshman in our college
dorm, and although this was some 20 years later, she took a breath
and did what she'd done then: sized up the other guests to see
whose clothes might fit her, and set out to meet them. Jeans, a
T-shirt and a pair of socks later, she had broken the ice for the
group. She found out in the days to come that her benefactors were
players in various high-powered arenas in their other lives, which
might have intimidated her had she known it before she wore their
socks.
</P>
<P>
   My children are the ones who've had the most to do with
loosening my grasp on the Suitcase for Every Contingency. Now they
are 6 and 8, meaning the era of required mountains of paraphernalia
is receding into a far-distant nightmare. Lugging all that stuff
just plain wore me down.
</P>
<P>
   These days the girls pack and wheel around their own little
suitcases, blue plastic with big red and yellow stripes and a
zipper pocket for a toothbrush. If an item doesn't fit, it doesn't
come. Toys from home are beside the point anyway in late summer,
when caterpillars with wild stripes and antennae on both ends can
be captured and coerced to climb over rocks picked up at the beach
and fashioned into a three-ring circus. If we run out of books, we
seek out the town library, where the titles in the quiet cool
haven't changed since I was their age.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, though, their father and I had a momentary
relapse. Heading from the city to the country, trying to avoid a
Saturday shopping trip, we loaded up a cooler with all the food
we'd need, and dragged out tennis racquets, astronomy books and
binoculars (``There might be a meteor shower! We don't want to miss
THAT!''). Then we drove blithely out of the garage, leaving the
cooler, racquets and star finder sitting on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   The garage attendants rescued the cooler and racquets, which
were waiting for us on our return. But forgetfulness saved me from
myself. Leaving the food behind meant I ventured out in the early
sun to be the first customer at the local orchard, where the
morning's yield of peaches and tomatoes was piled expectantly in
pyramids. The apple-cider doughnuts were plopping off the conveyor
belt of the old-fashioned steel doughnut-making machine and into
their bath of sugar, and were still warm when the girls dived into
the bag. Instead of playing tennis I walked country roads that
meander through fields thick with wildflowers, blue chicory and
Queen Anne's lace, goldenrod and wild sunflowers, so high that you
might miss the occasional grazing colt or cow. Bees and butterflies
feasted in a late-season frenzy, and milkweed pods split their
seams almost audibly.
</P>
<P>
   That night the harvest moon emerged, rising as if hoisted on a
pulley from behind the darkening hills. It was so full and
brilliant, with one cheeky planet as a sidekick, that any
constellations we might have puzzled out with the star finder were
hopelessly upstaged.

WEB SHOPPING? NOT FOR THE PICKY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On days when life is under control in our household, either my
husband or I will take the baby to shop at a friendly family-owned
grocery. We all benefit from such leisurely outings.
</P>
<P>
   Clementine always gets a cookie (iced) from the owner, who also
remembers to ask us how our older daughters are liking school so
far this year. We bask in the amazing luxury of checkout clerks who
cheerfully insist on bagging all the groceries.
</P>
<P>
   But more often, our household suffers shopping emergencies.
Alerted by the baby sitter that the premises are devoid of some
absolutely vital item, I will jump up from my desk to rush out to
buy, say, diapers.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, that pattern should make me an ideal candidate for
online shopping _ at least for mundane, nonperishable provisions.
After all, I could conveniently arrange for the delivery of whole
truckloads of diapers _ and avoid unduly interrupting my work or
appearing in public in my lucky writing sweatpants (paint-spattered
on one leg).
</P>
<P>
   But in reality, I am as reluctant as the next shopper to tinker
with my habits. That's because shopping isn't really about
shopping. It's about defining ourselves through the acquisition of
goods, the items that tell the rest of the world about our wants,
needs and tastes, including our willingness to eat generic-brand
corn niblets.
</P>
<P>
   So as I browsed through online shopping sites recently, I
realized that I would need an incentive to make an actual purchase,
some prize or reward. Something like _ hey, a chance to earn free
movie tickets.
</P>
<P>
   I had arrived at www.freeride.com, one of a growing number of
marketing Web sites that award prizes to online shoppers. The more
you buy from Freeride partners like www.netgrocer.com,
www.books.com or www.magmall.com, the more points you earn.
</P>
<P>
   Freeride users who accumulate enough points can redeem them for
a $20 gift certificate at Tower Records (1,000 points), a $5 gift
certificate at Red Lobster (275 points) or even a Playboy T-shirt
(800 points). Me? I opened a Freeride account with the relatively
modest goal of getting a free ticket for ``There's Something About
Mary''(460 points) before it left town.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing new about Freeride's brand of marketing, of
course. Today's online techniques borrow heavily from the same
marketing efforts that led to the trading stamp craze that began
throughout the United States and Canada at the turn of the century,
according to David Monot, a historian and author of ``Store Wars:
Shopkeepers and the Culture of Mass Marketing 1890-1939''
(University of Toronto Press, 1996).
</P>
<P>
   In those days, the tedium of routine shopping was replaced by
the excitement of earning stamps for purchases, then pasting them
into books. Full books could be redeemed for prizes. The trading
stamp era ended in scandal after some unscrupulous stamp companies
didn't pony up the rewards they had promised shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   But after I called Freeride's founder, Jordan Stanley, I was
confident that Freeride was a legitimate business _ and not just
because I learned, coincidentally, that Stanley lived in the same
town I do. And not because every time I go to the Little League
fields, I practically drive by his house, which would make it
really convenient to knock on his door to complain if free movie
passes failed to arrive promptly in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   No, what endeared Stanley to me was that he gave me tips for
earning Freeride points without actually buying anything.
</P>
<P>
   How I love to beat the system. By filling out surveys Stanley
told me about, I earned 55 points. By clicking on any of the
designated shopping sites promoted on the Freeride site, I could
earn 5 more points.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley even told me how to set up a second Freeride account to
get around paying a $4.99 shipping fee that Netgrocer wanted to
charge me to get six cases of 48 diapers delivered to my door by
Federal Express.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just started a new promotion _ it waives the shipping,''
Stanley said. ``Go to www.att.net, click on the Freeride ad that
rotates on that site, then set up a new Freeride account in your
husband's name and go to Netgrocer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the head start given me by Stanley, I wavered. The
real problem was one of choice: On the day I shopped, Netgrocer's
best value in the category of diapers was 48 Pampers Baby Dry
Stretch Size 4, packaged in a green bag, for $13.49: about what I
would pay at the store (once the shipping was waived).
</P>
<P>
   But our regular brand is Huggies Ultratrim Girls Size 4, in a
pink bag, which would cost $14.58 for the same number of diapers, a
dollar more than I would pay at the store.
</P>
<P>
   I felt paralyzed by indecision: Should I get the price I want or
the diapers I want? I phoned Daniel Miller, a British
anthropologist, for guidance, and he made me feel much better.
``Shopping isn't just about defining yourself,'' Miller said.
``It's really about defining your relationships to the people
closest to you, in this case, your infant.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who spent a year studying the shopping habits of North
London families for his new book, ``A Theory of Shopping'' (Cornell
University Press), was confident that my crisis was a common case
of ``infant obsession.'' That syndrome is characterized by the
creation of a largely fictitious list of the infant's likes and
dislikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents develop strong views about the particular nature of
their infants,'' Miller explained. ``That comes out with items of
clothing _ what an infant supposedly likes to wear or doesn't like
to wear _ and with particular foodstuffs.''
</P>
<P>
   In case I might have thought that Miller was being too critical
of obsessed parents, he added, ``It's a way of expressing love.''
</P>
<P>
   He was right, of course. Anyone can see that my baby is the sort
who likes to wear diapers that come in a pink bag, not green, and
it makes more sense to buy them at the store than over the
Internet, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   With that problem solved, I logged off, never earning the points
I needed for a movie ticket. But we continue to reap the rewards of
off-line shopping. Both Clementine and her father came home from
the store Thursday licking icing off their fingers.

IDENTITY EVOLUTION: THE MUTANT LOGO  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By PHIL PATTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Corporate logos are supposed to be universal and unchanging,
their color, size and placement spelled out in corporate-image
policy books. From IBM to Federal Express, the power to imprint
everything from a headquarters building to business cards has been
a sign of corporate efficiency and organization, implying a power
and dependability customers could trust.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, logos show signs of softening up and growing more
playful. The logo for Void, a new design firm that just opened in
South Park, San Francisco's high-tech area, is not a single image
but a changing series of shapes, different on each and every
letterhead, business card, fax or envelope.
</P>
<P>
   The series of ringlike ``void'' shapes, like a succession of
ham-slice bones, was designed by Bruce Mau as a kind of anti-logo,
an intentionally mutable brand, a family of shapes. Mau, best known
for his designs for Zone Books and his collaboration with the
architect Rem Koolhaas on ``S,M,L,XL'' (Monacelli Press, 1995),
worked with Nancy Nowacek of his office, playing with the ``o'' in
Void.
</P>
<P>
   Void's logo may be just right for a population increasingly
oversaturated with advertising and marketing _ and perhaps more
cynical as a result. Today, established logos are parodied in
T-shirts and other graphics. Tide is mocked as Jive. Employees long
ago nicknamed AT&AMP;T's logo the Death Star, suggesting a comparison
between the Evil Empire of ``Star Wars'' and the brute force of a
huge company in the midst of layoffs. And the Nike swoosh grew so
ubiquitous, and the company's effort to expand into such sports as
in-line skating and skateboarding so annoyed younger people, that
instead of focusing attention on the company, the logo has come to
focus resentment as the ``swooshstika.''
</P>
<P>
   Lighter, more handmade-looking logos, like Apple's sketchy one
for the Newton or Lucent Technology's apparently brush-drawn
circle, seem to be responses to stamped-out images. Knopf has rung
playful changes on its borzoi colophon for years now.
</P>
<P>
   There are also signs of a backlash to the recent business
obsession with branding, of which the logo is a key element. An
example is Jones soda, with its deadpan generic name and bottles
decorated with a variety of black-and-white snapshots chosen from
many that were submitted by customers.
</P>
<P>
   To Alex Isley, a graphic designer, it seems that companies are
growing more relaxed about their logos. ``They are more willing to
play fast and loose with their identities,'' he said. ``It's a
reaction to what came before _ the modernist abstract icon. They
want to show they are not threatening corporate entities.''
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley's high-tech concerns have led the way in logo
innovation (as in the orthography and language of their names), and
leading those leaders are the design firms that create the logos
for them.
</P>
<P>
   Void stands for ``Virtual Office of Integrated Design,''
recently formed by Thomas Meyerhoffer, who designed the Emate
educational computer while he was at Apple's Newton division, and
Yves Behar, formerly of Lunar Design and Frog-design. The new
company will call on specialists for each project. It is therefore
``virtual,'' Behar said, and for this reason, ``the logo is
`pliable' and reflects an organization adaptable to change.''
Eventually, the shapes may be generated at random, as some software
randomly generates letters of different shapes in avant-garde
typography, a sort of ransom-note approach.
</P>
<P>
   What Mau has created for Void is like a series of frames from an
animation. He even considered a flip book of them. The only place
the family of Void shapes comes together, at least for now, is on
the company's Web page (www.voidweb.com), where the ``o's'' are
laid up on top of one another in varying colors _ a kind of
superlogo resembling some sort of modern sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   Void's logo may be a sign that these days, static, printed logos
look with envy at the elaborate logo changes on television _
consider the computerized mutations of network logos, from MTV to
MSNBC _ or even on the computer screen _ the animated moving logos
of the Netscape or Microsoft Web browsers.
</P>
<P>
   And since, like Void, more and more companies are increasingly
``virtual,'' with more and more temporary workers and changing
projects, changing logos might be the coming thing. Constantly
``re-engineering'' and ``reinventing'' themselves, in biz-think
lingo, companies want to appear dynamic. In such a world, mutating
logos may better represent the aspirations, if not necessarily the
reality, of many companies, than fixed ones.

A FAMILIAR TERROR CLOTHED IN NEW SOFTWARE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Sentinel Returns is a game about surveillance. Based on a 1985
strategy game for eight-bit microcomputers like the Spectrum, the
Amiga and the Atari ST, Sentinel retains the terrifying elegance of
the original.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine playing king of the hill on a lunar landscape under
panoptic surveillance. Starting at the lowest point on a honeycomb
of rocks and cliffs, the player must reach the summit and destroy
the Sentinel, who turns slowly, like a malevolent lighthouse at the
pinnacle, neutralizing any threat in his field of vision.
</P>
<P>
   In the glare of his invisible, energy-draining gaze, your life
force is systematically sapped unless you find something to hide
behind or can scramble into a crevasse or escape to some shielded
lower ground where you can take shelter until the surveillance beam
passes on _ assuming you have enough energy left to take flight.
</P>
<P>
   You can't just run. To move, you have to build a robot tower and
project yourself into it. And creating objects requires energy,
just as absorbing objects, including the robots you once occupied,
absorbs energy.
</P>
<P>
   In advanced levels, the Sentinel can place multiple watchtowers
on the landscape, creating a web of rotating infrared scanners that
give you little time to hide. If they see all of you, they'll
extract your energy. If they can see only part of you, they'll
create drones in your vicinity that can flush you out, perhaps to a
more exposed area where the Sentinel can execute a full scan.
</P>
<P>
   In this unnervingly disembodied universe, all objects are
fungible. You have no physical substance. You are merely a presence
that moves throughout the landscape by transferring itself from one
mechanical host to another.
</P>
<P>
   And surveillance is all that's necessary to absorb things. Look
at an object, and it disappears. You've captured its energy. Fall
under surveillance yourself, and you evaporate. You have been
absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, you are trying to capture the high ground _ you want
to survey the Sentinel and, by doing so, destroy him. In the
meantime, while he maintains the high ground, he's trying to absorb
you.
</P>
<P>
   Should he succeed, there are no theatrics, no bullets, no laser
beam explosions to punctuate your demise. You can only hover,
watching your robot host vaporize as the Sentinel assimilates its
energy. In this context, surveillance is not a prelude to
destruction. Surveillance is itself the destructive force _ the
ultimate weapon. You can't retaliate. All you can do is hide and
watch, compulsively, for signs that you're being monitored.
</P>
<P>
   It's a very tense, paranoiac experience, heightened by the
unearthly vistas, atmospheric score (by John Carpenter, of
``Halloween'' fame) and your own limited ability to survey the
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Scrolling is deliberately slowed so that when you're being
scanned, there's a panicky struggle just to look around for an
escape route or anything to throw between yourself and the
surveillance beam that's draining your last store of energy.
</P>
<P>
   It's not action-movie fear. It's Hitchcock fear. It's not about
what happens on the screen. It's about what happens in your head,
and it has a kind of pressure and intensity that no
computer-generated monster can possibly match. Invisible things are
always the most frightening. And what could be more frightening
than an invisible enemy from whom you can only hide, in a world
where surveillance is siege.
</P>
<P>
   In the Sentinel's world, being watched is not a neutral state.
It's literally erosive _ unlike surveillance in the real world,
where we are constantly watched by security cameras and database
marketers but it's OK because all those people who run credit card
companies and advertising agencies and Web sites want only to
improve your life.
</P>
<P>
   Employers who rifle through office e-mail, companies that
monitor telephone conversations (in the interest of quality
control), governments that oppose electronic privacy (if you're not
a terrorist or a child pornographer, why would you possibly need
it?) _ they're just trying to make the world a safer and more
productive place. Keeping tabs on people doesn't do any harm.
Right?
</P>
<P>
   In the networked economy, our daily lives are predicated on this
assumption. But in fact, the ubiquitous cameras and data mining and
consumer tracking do engender a kind of background stress. You feel
it every time a telemarketer phones during dinner, every time you
throw away a junk mail envelope, view a piece of unsolicited e-mail
or wonder whether an instant message really disappeared or just
tumbled down the corporate memory hole to haunt you at some later
date.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of its end use, surveillance extracts a cost. Time,
energy, information _ control _ flows to the viewer from the
viewed. That's why it matters who is controlling the scanners,
whether it's some guy connecting a Web cam to the Internet, a
government mounting video cameras on telephone poles or an employer
peering over your shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   That's why things change when you put cameras in squad cars,
because police officers act differently when they know they are
being watched.
</P>
<P>
   Surveillance defines the axis of power, and Sentinel reduces
this dynamic to its purest form. Whoever's watching wins. At the
end of each level, you destroy the Sentinel by getting close enough
to view his face. The enemy tower explodes. You build your own
tower on the vacant plinth, and you become the Sentinel.
</P>
<P>
   Before starting at the bottom of a new, even more dangerous
landscape, you have the pre-eminent view. And in a world where
everything's under surveillance, the camera is king.

 By TRACIE ROZHON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Peggy Fitzpatrick was asking $899,000 for her
2,500-square-foot loft at the corner of Broadway and Washington
Place. Since she had just listed it in mid-August, she wouldn't _
in an ordinary season _ be thinking of marking it down yet.
</P>
<P>
   But this is no ordinary time. And on Sept. 11, Ms. Fitzpatrick,
48, a retired Wall Street bond seller, lopped $100,000 off her
asking price. ``People are nervous about what the markets are doing
globally,'' she said. ``They are reluctant to pull the trigger to
buy, and to compensate for their nervousness, I'm dropping my price
10 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fitzpatrick is not alone. Hundreds of sellers of co-ops and
condominiums dropped their prices last week, according to
principals of two of Manhattan's best-known real estate companies,
Halstead Property Co. and Corcoran Group, who call these the first
such recognizable drops since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Clark Halstead, managing partner of Halstead, said that these
``wholesale'' reductions should be seen as a real estate market
correction, not necessarily the beginning of a decline. The stock
market volatility, he said, merely ``brought greedy sellers to
their senses.''
</P>
<P>
   Other brokerage houses say they do not keep statistics on price
drops, but they do report plenty of nervousness among both buyers
and sellers of Manhattan apartments. Nonetheless, at Douglas
Elliman and Brown Harris Stevens, executives say they do not
consider the number of price drops significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``But about one-third of our buyers _ those that don't need to
buy _ are stepping back and delaying,'' Hall Willkie, an executive
vice president at Brown Harris, said. ``And there are a lot of
sellers asking, `Am I going to get less than a month ago?' I tell
them it'll be more difficult to sell; it will depend on what
happens on Wall Street two months from now. And whatever it is,
it'll have a major impact on our market.''
</P>
<P>
   According to statistics gathered by Corcoran Group, 63 of
Manhattan's apartments priced at more than $1 million were marked
down last week, by an average of 10 percent. Of the apartments less
than $1 million, another 303 were dropped in price, by an average
of about 5 percent, Barbara Corcoran, chairwoman of the company,
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding wars, in which ravenous buyers drive the price of
desirable apartments higher and higher, seem to be pretty much a
thing of the past, brokers agreed. Last spring, they made up
one-third of Corcoran's deals. In the last two weeks, Ms. Corcoran
said, there has been one bidding war. Of last week's Corcoran
deals, only two properties had multiple offers and only three sold
for the full asking price. It was a far cry from last spring, when
brokers in Manhattan routinely sold apartments at full asking price
_ or higher.
</P>
<P>
   For those who say the drops might be seasonal, Ms. Corcoran
laughed. ``The week before the stock market dipped, we had 179
price reductions,'' she said. ``The week after, we had 273.'' Other
brokers said that autumn was usually a strong season, second only
to the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Peters, president of Ashforth Warburg Associates, said
he does not track price reductions. But he said the city's co-op
market has suddenly got more negotiable. ``For the first time in
two years, I would use the word `opportunity,''' he said.
``Especially some apartments that need renovations; in the spring,
those would still have sold for record amounts. Now the sellers are
reducing their prices.''
</P>
<P>
   But Peters, like many of the real estate agents interviewed, is
cautious. ``It's not quite like 1991, when you could go for the
jugular, when you could offer half,'' he remarked. He termed
Corcoran Group's average 10 percent drops for the highest-priced
apartments ``right in line'' with his own company's experience. ``I
don't think either the stock market or the real estate market is
going to crater,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   After years of steadily rising stock market averages, the market
has recently raised the curtain on its Jekyll and Hyde show: On
Aug. 31, the market plunged 512 points, recovering 288 points the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   In the Hamptons, territory known to be tied to Wall Street,
Frank Newbold, manager of Sotheby's East Hampton office, said that
after Labor Day, he received a spate of calls from sellers in
middle market _ not from the high end _ asking him to reduce
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say, `Let's drop it a notch and move it before fall,'''
he said. Newbold gave the example of a seller with a house asking
$650,000. ``He's dropping it to $595,000,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike some properties in Manhattan, the Sotheby's executive
say that the multimillion-dollar beach bungalows and Georgica Pond
estates are holding firm.
</P>
<P>
   And in Connecticut, in the counties tied closely to Wall
Street's travails, several well-respected brokers reported that the
stock market's gyrations has had no visible effect on their
thriving real estate market.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are taking cognizance of the market's roller
coastering,'' said Linda Hodge, a broker with Preferred Properties
in Greenwich, but she was quick to add that they are ``not flocking
like lemmings to cut the price of their house.''

A PLEA-BARGAIN FOR THE PRESIDENT

   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIMOTHY SPENCE  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lying about a little hanky-panky between consenting
adults is no reason to abort a presidency. That much is clear from
the crescendo of X-rated details that the Whitewater special
prosecutor and his supporters in Congress are providing to the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Sure President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky are guilty of being
emotionally fragile and careless individuals. And there's no
question that Clinton committed a stupid act in lying so forcefully
about his adolescent indulgences in the recesses of the Oval
Office.
</P>
<P>
   But impeach the guy for a sorry dalliance? Maybe Hillary Rodham
Clinton should, but not Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that the Republicans in Congress will do all they
can to use the affair to discredit the president, just as Clinton
will use his strong poll ratings as proof that the public is
willing to forgive him.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the country is the victim of the petty theft of its
dignity.
</P>
<P>
   There is an escape if these competing forces would show the
leadership that has been so woefully lacking in Clinton's
Washington. There is, for example, a plea-bargain. Congress would
immediately end Kenneth Starr's salacious impeachment investigation
and all the baggage that goes with it. In return, the president
would call it quits.
</P>
<P>
   Such a scenario is not beyond the realm of possible. Michael
McCurry, the presidential spokesman, said Tuesday that the
administration wants to work with Congress ``to find a course of
action that is the correct one, that will have bipartisan support,
that the people of Congress together agree is the right course for
our nation ...''
</P>
<P>
   Well before Clinton admitted fibbing about Monica, he had
demonstrated that his administration would be a middling one at
best. Clinton failed to use the great wealth of this age to improve
the human condition. The promise of providing health care for
millions of Americans collapsed under the president's dithering,
turning national health policy over to the first lady and her
clique.
</P>
<P>
   A man who rescued the Democratic Party from irrelevancy has
consistently alienated lawmakers from his own ranks, through his
sudden compromises with Republicans on ``welfare reform'' and
budget deals _ and ultimately, by lying to them about his
extramarital activity.
</P>
<P>
   And the list goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Candidate Clinton put all regard for the law aside to raise
bucks for his 1996 re-election campaign; President Clinton
denounced the Republicans for scuttling efforts to change the way
political campaigns are financed.
</P>
<P>
   The disappointment extends beyond our borders.
</P>
<P>
   In the Middle East, the administration's floundering lost the
momentum of the peace process. In Asia, the White House ignored
Japan's early efforts to confront the region's looming financial
problems and instead talked the wonders of the global economy. And
in Russia, Clinton's blind support of the faltering Yeltsin
government only hastened that country's meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with his wings clipped and so many of his initiatives
lost, Clinton can't even muscle enough support in Congress to pay
the wealthiest nation's dues to the United Nations. And while
tyrants in Serbia and Iraq flaunt international law, the White
House has failed to muster our allies to respond.
</P>
<P>
   This president might be able to find enough faith in poll
numbers to survive the rest of his term. But he will face hostility
along the way, from Republicans who could capitalize on this lamest
of lame ducks, and from Democrats alienated by their leader's
unpredictable behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In 1861, as he struggled with a restive Congress and a war that
was going badly, Abraham Lincoln urged the nation's leaders to
avoid petty debate and do what would be remembered ``through time
and eternity.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who run Congress today should take the advice of the
founding father of the Republican Party. No more arguments, just a
dignified compromise: Drop all charges against the president and
allow him to leave office honorably.
</P>
<P>
   In his parting words, President Clinton should offer an
unqualified apology to appease the tempest from the right, and ask
that in exchange for his sacrifice, Americans remember that if
purity is the only criterion for leadership, a great nation and its
institutions cannot endure.

DMA SHOW REVEALS THE JEWELER LALIQUE AS A PIONEER OF MODERNISM
</HEADLINE>

   DALLAS _ For most of us, the bright colors and lively anecdotes
of impressionist painting sum up Paris at the turn of the 20th
century. But there is another side to ``fin de siecle'' urban life
in France _ a poetic side that is given short shrift.
</P>
<P>
   Those poetics are strongly evoked in the Dallas Museum of Art's
display of jewelry and decorative objects by Rene Lalique
(1860-1945). Just as Proust's taste of a madeleine triggered his
remembrance of things past, so ``The Jewels of Lalique'' immerses
us in a world of strange delicacy, often-dark dreams and fantastic
hybrids, exquisite observation and other tendencies that could be
seen as precursors of surrealism.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in Lalique's ``Rose Petals'' toilette set (1909),
the brushes, mirror, jars and other silver-and-crystal components
are decorated with thorns and molded-glass rose petals that speak
to the fleeting nature of youthful beauty.
</P>
<P>
   In his massive ``Two Cicadas'' vase (1912) in molded and stained
glass, the bulging heads of two gigantic, dark gray insects flank
the opening, while their wings accentuate its tapering to a narrow
base.
</P>
<P>
   Curiouser and curiouser, in his drawing for a tiara (circa
1885), Lalique tops this symbol of privilege with not only spiky
dandelion leaves but also a fragile pouf _ the weed having gone to
seed.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, Lalique resorts to natural motifs that, in the
context of jewelry, possess an unsettling resonance. Rooted in his
childhood life in the country, this fascination with nature
combined with Lalique's interest in Greek and Roman classicism and
Japanese design to define a personal aesthetic that, in turn,
defined the reach of art nouveau and art deco.
</P>
<P>
   Lalique also made radical breakthroughs in materials and design:
He pioneered the use of horn, enamel, glass and semiprecious
stones, exploiting their properties in previously unimagined ways
with subtlety and clarity. This, at a time when his colleagues were
fashioning conventional settings for conspicuously valuable
diamonds, rubies and the like.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Lalique's earliest designs were relatively
conventional. His breakthrough came when he started creating stage
jewelry for Sarah Bernhardt, whom he met in 1894. By the mid-1890s,
Lalique would proclaim that he wanted to ``create something never
seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   Come the dawn of the new century, it was confirmed: Lalique was
recognized as Europe's most important maker of art jewelry and its
first modernist.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at century's end, it is time to confirm another claim: Rene
Lalique was a major pioneer of modernism, period.  &QL;

are back in a big way. With two ``Scream'' movies each grossing
$100 million, ``I Know What You Did Last Summer'' doing well enough
to have already spawned a sequel, the vampire thriller ``Blade'' a

IT'S A GIRL THING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ David Kirschner has made three ``Child's Play''
films. If you don't know the titles, you might remember their
anti-hero, Chucky, the demon-possessed doll with the butcher-knife
fetish. The last one was released in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Well, `Child's Play 3'' tanked, but Kirschner never gave up on
the notion of another Chucky film. He pitched an idea _ Chucky gets
married! _ to Universal production chairman Marc Platt in December
1996. Platt politely said, ``Wait a month, and I'll get back to
you.''
</P>
<P>
   A month passed. In the meantime, ``Scream'' opened to theaters
packed with teens. Platt's daughter went to a sleep-over at a
friend's house where a gaggle of girls stayed up all night and
watched ``Child's Play,'' ``Child's Play 2'' and ``Child's Play
3.'' The day after his daughter gave him the thumbs-up, Platt
called Kirschner. ``Bride of Chucky'' was a go.
</P>
<P>
   ``This 13-year-old girl got my movie made,'' Kirschner says
laughing. ``I guess what they say about teen-age girls is true.
They do have the power.''
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of ``Titanic'' and all of its Leo-fueled
mania, nowhere has that girl power been more apparent than with the
recent resurgence of horror movies. Twenty years ago, when slasher
fare like ``Halloween,'' ``Friday the 13th'' and ``Prom Night'' was
all the rage, horror movies were aimed at teen-age boys, seen by
teen-age boys and dissected ad nauseam by teen-age boys.
</P>
<P>
   Now the dynamic has changed. It's the girls who are turning
movies like ``Halloween: H20'' and ``I Know What You Did Last
Summer'' into monster hits. It's a new generation _ call them
``Scream'' queens _ and the cinematic blood can't flow fast enough
to suit their tastes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally my daughter thinks I'm cool,'' says ``Halloween: H20''
director Steve Miner. ``I think she's seen the first `Halloween' a
dozen times. She sees Jamie Lee Curtis' character as kind of a role
model.''
</P>
<P>
   A female heroine ... in a horror movie? That's a switch. Ever
since Alfred Hitchcock's ``Psycho,'' critics (social, film and
otherwise) have accused the genre of misogyny, saying that its
violence is primarily directed toward women who are seen as
helpless victims. It's an argument that was parodied in the
self-referential ``Scream.'' Once a young woman has sex, argued
Randy, the film's resident horror movie buff, she'd inevitably be
dead 10 minutes later. Presumably, this was of some comfort to the
young males in the audience who weren't so lucky in the ways of
love.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the filmmakers who make these cinematic blood baths
don't exactly look at it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to see women as victims everywhere, when they're
not,'' says John Carpenter, director of ``Halloween'' and the
upcoming ``John Carpenter's Vampires.'' ``Jamie Lee Curtis said
something interesting about the first `Halloween': `I got to play
the intelligent, surviving, smart teen-ager. I didn't take my
clothes off until I made mainstream movies.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, movies like the ``Scream'' series, ``I Know What You Did
Last Summer'' and its soon-to-released sequel, ``I Still Know What
You Did Last Summer,'' and Sony's suspense thriller ``Urban
Legend'' (in theaters Friday) feature strong, smart female
characters who play significant roles in the films' story lines.
And in the boy's club that is Hollywood, that's a significant
exception to the rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of television shows like `Party of Five' and `Buffy
(the Vampire Slayer),' these movies are the places you go to see
people just like you,'' says Luci Bissinger, a 17-year-old from
Woodland Hills who was standing in line with friends to see ``H20''
for a second time. ``Mostly, though, I think horror movies are just
a lot of fun. It's like a roller-coaster ride. You don't want to
look half the time, but you do want to look, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we do. And so do young actresses, who seem to be among the
genre's biggest fans. Because good parts are hard to come by,
horror movies have attracted a who's who of teens and 20-somethings
to their acting ranks, including Drew Barrymore, Neve Campbell,
Jennifer Love Hewitt, Jada Pinkett, Courteney Cox, Alicia Witt,
Sara Michelle Gellar, Heather Graham, Tori Spelling ... well, you
get the idea. Actresses love these movies so much that the
competition for them has become rather intense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told my agent I had to be in the second `Scream'; I
didn't care if I was on the screen for 10 seconds,'' says Gellar,
better-known to some as Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Gellar was also
in ``I Know What You Did Last Summer'' and says she just might make
another horror movie in the next year or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``These films are so much fun to make,'' Gellar says. ``And I do
think they've changed. They're smarter, for one thing. And they
offer actresses some of the best parts they'll find.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis, the genre's designated godmother, says that was
certainly the case when she took the first ``Halloween'' 20 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 19, I was making $235 a week on `Operation Petticoat'
and I was lucky to have five lines on the show a week,'' Curtis
says. ``When I read the script for `Halloween,' every single page
had the name Laurie on it. She was all over the place. And she was
this smart, vulnerable and interesting girl. I would have killed to
get that part.''
</P>
<P>
   An interesting choice of words, but they get the point across,
don't they? In the 20 years since Curtis first played Laurie
Strode, things have only improved. Nowadays, most horror movies
have several meaty parts for actresses. Even Chucky is getting into
the act, taking a bride.
</P>
<P>
   ``In horror movies, it used to be that women always played the
damsels in distress, and who wants to see that?'' asks Witt, who
stars in ``Urban Legend.'' ``Now, you have female characters that
come out victorious over the evil psychos, and that's not a bad
fantasy to have. I think that's why you see a lot of girls in the
audiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if some of the girls might be a little too young.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think these films _ even the new ones _ are
appropriate for young girls,'' Curtis says. ``My 12-year-old
daughter wanted to see `Scream' because half her friends had seen
it. But I think that's reprehensible. Parents shouldn't allow kids
that age to see movies where young people are stalked and
brutalized.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's the rub. The roles for women may have changed, but
the rules of the horror genre remain etched in blood. Young people
die _ violently. Perversely, that's part of the attraction _ the
``fun,'' if you will _ for teen-age audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Says Kevin Williamson, who wrote both ``Scream'' movies and ``I
Know What You Did Last Summer'': ``If parents don't like it, that
only makes it all the better, doesn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   These days, teen-age boys _ and girls _ couldn't seem to agree
more.

SOMETHING'S COMING TO GET YOU
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; It's no shock that horror movies are back in a
big way.
</P>
<P>
   With two ``Scream'' movies grossing $100 million each, ``I Know
What You Did Last Summer'' doing well enough to have already
spawned a sequel, the vampire thriller ``Blade'' a surprisingly
strong late summer entry and a resuscitated ``Halloween'' franchise
entry that made some $50 million last month, Hollywood has
predictably gone into high monster mash mode.
</P>
<P>
   Before the end of the year, we'll not only be subjected to ``I
Still Know What You Did Last Summer,'' but also ``Urban Legend''
(which opens Friday), the ``Child's Play'' sequel ``Bride of
Chucky,'' ``Cannibal! The Musical,'' ``John Carpenter's Vampires,''
Gus Van Sant's remake of Alfred Hitchcock's seminal ``Psycho'' and
``The Faculty,'' written by genre re-animator Kevin Williamson
(both ``Screams,'' the original ``Last Summer,'' ``Halloween:
H20'') and directed by Robert Rodriguez (``From Dusk Till Dawn'').
</P>
<P>
   Copycat bandwagons like this are, of course, a Hollywood
tradition that goes at least as far back as the original Universal
horror film cycle begun in the early 1930s with the first sound
versions of ``Dracula'' and ``Frankenstein.''
</P>
<P>
   Fright films have phased in and out of mass popularity ever
since, with different formulas dominating each upswing era. Roger
Corman's Edgar Allan Poe pictures and the British Hammer horrors of
the 1960s, for example, emphasized sensuality and sadism, while the
slasher films of the late '70s and '80s were misogynistic
gorefests, often presented from the killer's point of view.
</P>
<P>
   The current wave has its own winning formula, according to those
who make them. ``The `Scream' movies copped a new phrase,''
observes Jamie Lee Curtis, scream queen of the slasher cycle and
star of ``Halloween: H20.'' ``In the '50s it was monster movies, in
the '70s/'80s it was horror movies, in the '90s it's scary movies.
Scary movies are funny horror movies.''
</P>
<P>
   That certainly describes the basic, post-modern Williamson
approach to horror. The victims in his films are usually
media-savvy enough to mention that their predicament resembles this
or that slasher movie cliche before their own throats are slit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the genre ready to be spoofed,'' says actress Famke
Janssen who, after appearing in such horrid misfires as ``Lord of
Illusions'' and ``Deep Rising,'' is grateful to have worked on
``The Faculty,'' a film about possessed schoolteachers. ``Horror is
such a B-movie genre; it's so rare that people make a really good
one. The silliness of it all was captured really well by
`Scream'.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's more than movie reference gags to the new cycle.
Pop-culture figures _ especially of the young, cute and televised
kind _ are evidently a vital component, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the heart of the last few movies that have been successful,
there was Neve Campbell and Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sarah Michelle
Gellar,'' producer Neal H. Moritz says, referring to the stars of
popular TV shows ``Party of Five'' and ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer.'' ``It helps because your key audience already has a
familiarity with these actors. It's kind of some pre-paid-for
marketing that you're getting from these TV shows.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Mortiz has packed ``Urban Legend'' with the likes
of Alicia Witt (TV's ``Cybill''), Jared Leto (``My So-Called
Life'') and Joshua Jackson (the Williamson-created ``Dawson's
Creek''), while ``Moesha'' star Brandy joins Love Hewitt for the
producer's ``Last Summer'' sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure another reason why `Scream' was so popular was
because it stars all these young people, and there hadn't been that
many movies for teen-agers to watch,'' adds Janssen. ``I'm not sure
if it was more the horror part of it or the teen-age part of it
that made the movies so popular.''
</P>
<P>
   But formula alone does not equal hit. The summer's Stepford-teen
thriller ``Disturbing Behavior'' fizzled, despite having starred
``Dawson's Creek'' dream girl Katie Holmes. And ``H20,'' which
boasted both genre in-references and another ``Dawson's'' starlet,
Michelle Williams, played too much like a traditional slasher film
and rapidly bled box office after its opening week.
</P>
<P>
   According to Snipes, who produced ``Blade'' as well as starred
as its superhero vampire slayer, those films' disappointing fates
might also be a result of young audiences' media-drenched
sensibility. The very genre hipness that made ``Scream'' so much
fun now makes any attempt to copy that pattern play like, well, the
knockoff that it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have now become so well-educated about movies, so film
literate, that they can predict certain things ahead of time,''
Snipes observes. ``They go into a movie trying to figure out who
did it. It's a heck of a thing to keep the twists and the turns and
the suspense workable. I think it has to be like a magic trick; you
divert them in one direction and then try to hit them with
something they never, ever expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a kind of twisted mind to do that, though. At least,
to do it well.''
</P>
<P>
   A mind like John Carpenter's, perhaps. Twenty years ago,
Carpenter wrote and directed ``Halloween,'' the widely imitated
slasher film that initiated the last major horror movie cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never worry about being ripped off; stealing is one of the
highest forms of flattery,'' says Carpenter, whose voice
nevertheless swells with pride when he describes his upcoming
``Vampires'' as a horror western with no teen-agers involved. ``But
this latest group of horror films appeals to this very cynical,
young new audience who believe very sincerely that they're smarter
than the movies they see. In some cases they are, in some cases
they aren't.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is because there's been a revolution in media,''
Carpenter adds. ``Before the 1980s, there wasn't the availability
of videotapes and laserdiscs that there is today. Now you can own a
movie, watch it a million times, learn it. It becomes generic to
you, like a piece of furniture.''
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, that makes it harder and harder for genre movies
to get away with repeating the same conventions and tropes.
Ideally, it conversely encourages originality and creativity _ two
qualities that, at least in general and until now, have
distinguished the current scary set from the slasher era's
slapdash, abstract blood baths.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're committing to the story and trying to make good
movies,'' Carpenter says of contemporary fright-film practitioners.
``And budgets are slightly bigger now than when I got into the
business. The only way you could do these films back then was on
the cheap. Now the product's slicker, which is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the scariest thing, at least for copycat-minded
producers, is that horror films now may rise or fail on their
creative quality. That would truly be a chilling break with the
genre traditions of exploitation and cheesiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's kind of odd now is that directors who do this sort of
movie, people think they're doing good work,'' says ``H20''
director Steve Miner, who produced ``Friday the 13th'' and directed
its first two sequels a generation ago. ``What happened? In the
'80s, these directors were called schlockmeisters, and now they're
all, like, venerated.''
</P>
<P>
   One studio, at least, seems to understand the value of that.
Dimension Films, the genre division of art-movie powerhouse
Miramax, has cleaned up with the ``Scream'' films (while making
their director, Wes Craven, a respected auteur), ``From Dusk Till
Dawn'' and ``H20,'' and has ``The Faculty'' scheduled for the
lucrative Christmas holiday session.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Miramax-Dimension people really respect the genre and try
to do these movies for mainstream audiences,'' Miner notes.
``They're passionate and truly believe in the power of movies and
want to make them as good as they can possibly be made. `Scream' is
a top-quality movie, really well-done, well-acted and funny.
Certainly, Dimension provides the arena and the support for us to
do that.''

MAKING `THE CUT'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STACY BROWN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The moment _ it's what every aspiring musician
hopes for when desperately trying to break into the often
intimidating world of pop music.
</P>
<P>
   And it's what an artist does with the moment that could
determine whether he or she ever makes it out of the ranks of
wanna-bes.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen-year-old Pierce College freshman Shenil Coleman's
moment came earlier this month at a Burbank sound stage, where she
was auditioning for the new MTV show ``The Cut.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous when I first got there,'' said Coleman, whose
talent can easily be obscured by her glowing personality and humble
attitude. ``I didn't know who was in the audition room, what they
wanted or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The folks at MTV had just completed nearly 15 hours of listening
to dozens of hopefuls, and Coleman, an avid viewer of the cable
network, was the final artist of the night. Patience was at a
minimum for the panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, my name is Shenil, and I would like to sing a song that I
wrote,'' she told the panel of five music experts who would decide
whether the shy teen would make ``The Cut.''
</P>
<P>
   After belting out ``Whose Gonna Love You Like That,'' a song she
co-wrote with musician David Fitzpatrick, MTV's Edna Simms
presented Coleman with that moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait a minute,'' said Simms, cutting Shenil off halfway
through her second original number, ``If I Told You.''
</P>
<P>
   Simms told Shenil that her pitch range was similar to divas
Anita Baker and Toni Braxton, but what she wanted to hear was an
even higher note.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whitney (Houston) wants to come out,'' Simms said. ``Can you
do something that will bring her out? I mean take us there (to a
higher pitch).''
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect to Baker and Braxton, both of whom she
admires, Coleman used an unrehearsed a cappella version of En
Vogue's ``Wherever You Are'' to capture the moment.
</P>
<P>
   The panel was moved to its feet with applause, leaving little
doubt that Coleman had stolen the moment and secured a spot on the
show, which begins taping Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, who attends classes in paralegal studies as well as
music at Pierce, has been singing since age 5, when her family
heard her belting out Baker's ``Been So Long.'' According to her
dad, Gregory Coleman, by age 7 Shenil had already ``mastered
nuances many artists never get about subtlety and restraint.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Coleman, who has worked for entertainment companies for
30 years, says he feared the hazards of the industry and decided to
wait before allowing his daughter to pursue a professional career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen what can happen to artists both young and old,'' he
said. ``I felt it wasn't time for her. Now it is.'' He says he
heard about ``The Cut'' _ which is a late-'90s version of Ed
McMahon's ``Star Search'' _ while at work, and wasted little time
forwarding material to MTV executives, who responded after hearing
Shenil's demo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know anything about it until the day of the
audition,'' she said. ``I was on the bus coming from school, and my
dad paged me and told me to get ready because they wanted me that
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, an MTV camera crew arrived at Shenil's West Hills home
to tape an interview for the show. Impressed by the crew's
treatment of her, Shenil sent a thank-you card to the show's
producers. ``They were so nice and kind, which was refreshing
because people aren't always that nice,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   We hear you.

APPLEGATE'S JESSE BOLSTERS NBC COMEDY NIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Thursdays are no longer ``must-see TV'' nights,
they are Bright-Kauffman-Crane nights. The creative team behind
``Friends'' and ``Veronica's Closet'' is back with another
half-hour of real estate on television's most popular night.
</P>
<P>
   It is time well-spent.
</P>
<P>
   After ``Friends'' will come ``Jesse,'' starring former ``Married
... With Children'' vamp Christina Applegate. And Buffalo, N.Y.,
never looked so good.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse is a 26-year-old single mother with a 10-year-old son, who
is probably the least trouble of all of the men in her life.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse's dad and boss is John Warner Sr. (George Dzundza) an
Archie Bunker-like tavern owner (not Archie Bunker's Place, but Der
Biergarten). Her older brother, John Jr. (John Lehr), stopped
talking a year ago for personal reasons. Her younger brother,
Darren (David DeLuise), is a schemer always looking to make a buck.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse wants to go back to school to become a nurse, but her
father, who distrusts anyone in the medical profession, is against
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse'' is sweet and funny and something that will help keep
NBC's Thursday-night lineup alive in the post-``Seinfeld'' era.
</P>
<P>
   It will also help Applegate shed her bimbo Kelly Bundy image
over the following, oh, let's say, eight seasons.

   NEW YORK _ In retailing, the young, the trendy and the new have
tended to go downtown, to TriBeCa, SoHo and Chelsea. So, it's nice
to see new life appearing this season on Madison Avenue, especially
that stretch between 72nd and 86th Streets.
</P>
<P>
   Madison Avenue, with its art galleries, luxury jewelry stores
and designer clothiers, is a street of dreams, for both customer
and retailer. But between 57th and 72nd Streets, it is too pricey
for most except big names like Crate and Barrel, Polo Ralph Lauren
and Armani. And until recently, Madison between 72nd and 86th
Streets had as many as 20 vacant storefronts and few takers.
Pottery Barn, wherefore art thou? Not on Madison.
</P>
<P>
   But this month, three flagship stores have moved onto Madison
Avenue in the '80s, with furniture, home accessories and
sweet-smelling soaps. They appeal to the young moneyed families
that walk the avenue _ many with double strollers _ as well as to
the longtime residents and the tourists on their way to and from
the museums.
</P>
<P>
   ``Empty storefronts used to be so depressing to see on
Madison,'' said Ava Baff, a Park Avenue resident for 21 years.
``It's so nice to have new stores here. I buy a lot of candles, and
I used to have to run to Bloomies or Bergdorf's if I needed
something at the last minute. Now, I can go around the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Faith Hope Consolo, the executive director of Garrick-Aug
Associates, a real estate firm, has seen a renewed interest in
retail space on Madison Avenue between 72nd and 86th Streets in the
last few months. ``We've done about a dozen deals,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One new storeowner is Helene Benhamou, a Moroccan-born
Frenchwoman, who last weekend opened a furniture and
home-accessories store, A La Maison, in a 3,000-square-foot space
at 1078 Madison Ave. (81st Street). She sells candles, glassware,
china and furniture, not unlike some at Pottery Barn, Crate and
Barrel or Bergdorf Goodman. Other items, like the colorfully
patterned French dinnerware, are exclusives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't only sell products here,'' said Ms. Benhamou, a
former Parisian antiques dealer. She has a party-planning service,
and will offer classes in table settings and flower arranging soon,
as well as free tea and coffee. ``Within six to eight months, I
plan to be in other locations in Manhattan _ like SoHo,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate brokers say that owners of downtown stores are also
eager to branch out uptown. Face Stockholm, with makeup shops on
Prince Street and on Columbus Avenue, opened on Madison Avenue at
62nd Street in July. Intermix, a trendy Flatiron district clothing
store, plans to open on Madison near 77th. Shops on the Upper West
Side have expanded east, like Olive &AMP; Bette's, a youthful clothier,
which has opened at Madison and 81st.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rentals are going fast north of Ralph Lauren,'' said Beth
Greenwald, a broker at New Spectrum Realty Services, referring to
the Polo shop at Madison and 72nd. ``Madison is booming,'' she
said. Retail rents can be as high as $500 a square foot a month
below 72nd Street, she said, but as low as $150 to $175 above.
</P>
<P>
   Esperanza and Amparo Carrasco plan to open Maison Decor Thursday
at 1100 Madison Ave. (82nd Street), the first American outpost of
their father's textile and furniture store in Madrid, which has
more than 60 shops in Europe and South America. In stock are 200
mid-priced cotton upholstery fabrics. Some 600 more fabrics can be
delivered within two weeks. The fabrics range from $17 a yard for a
cotton check to $75 a yard for a cotton velvet, with most between
$20 and $40 a yard. Maison Decor also offers reupholstery,
slipcovers and window treatments and sells sofas, chairs, cast-iron
coffee tables, bed frames and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   The third new store is Fresh, in a skylighted space at 1016
Madison (81st Street), opposite E.A.T. It sells nearly 500 natural
bath and beauty products; fragrances like vanilla, delphinium and
sweet pea, and table-top and bathroom accessories. The company has
until now sold its products only through stores like Barneys New
York and Portico Bed and Bath; other shops in England, France and
Russia, and its own boutique in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Lev Glazman and his wife, Alina Roytberg, Russian immigrants,
began the company in 1995 with eight scented soaps. Ms. Roytberg, a
Parsons School of Design graduate, is responsible for the
minimalist packaging; Glazman is the nose. ``We wanted to have a
flagship store here, and we wanted it to be on the Upper East
Side,'' she said. ``We didn't want to be a downtown store.''

 &HT;    THE TIES THAT BOUND CLINTON AND LEWINSKY
 &HT;    750&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (l) lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fashion scholars are not surprised that neckties
are so knotted up in the scandal involving Monica Lewinsky and
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Some psychiatrists have long considered the tie to be a phallic
symbol, said Gerald Andersen, director of the Neckwear Association
of America. And, he said, ``the necktie has always had romantic
connotations, going back to its origins when knights would wear
their lady's colors.''
</P>
<P>
   But ties play a remarkably prominent role in the drama involving
a sexual relationship between the 25-year-old former White House
intern and a president known for his fashion sense.
</P>
<P>
   Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's investigators quizzed
Clinton on whether he was using neckties to secretly signal
Lewinsky. And sex wasn't all they talked about in those late-night
calls from the Oval Office to her apartment in the Watergate
complex, Lewinsky told a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost all of our conversations included something about my
ties,'' she testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ties were a big issue with us,'' the Beverly Hills expatriate
explained. ``I worked in a men's necktie store when I was in
college. ... So I love ties. I can pick out, you know, different
designers and stuff. So this was a big thing for me. I liked to
give him ties and I liked to see him wearing them.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Lewinsky might have a special talent for selecting
ties, her feelings weren't unusual for a woman in an affair _ or a
marriage for that matter, said Ruth Rubinstein, a sociology
professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a woman, it's a love thing. When she gives a man a tie, he
can choose to wear it or not wear it. The woman's interest is
personal. If he wears my tie, he loves me. If he doesn't wear it,
he doesn't love me,'' said Rubinstein. ``Men don't always interpret
it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky took considerable pride in several ties by designers
Zegna, Hugo Boss and Calvin Klein. Made of imported silk, the ties
cost $100 or more apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The ties were were carefully chosen, ``beautifully made and very
expensive,'' Rubinstein said. ``She was giving him the message that
she really loved him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky said both she and Clinton took note when he wore one of
her gift ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to bug him about wearing one of my ties because then I
knew I was close to his heart,'' she told the grand jury. She said
that Clinton would call and ask, ``Did you see I wore your tie the
other day?''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky said she was shocked and crushed to see White House
steward Bayani Nelvis ``wearing the first tie I ever gave the
president'' to testify before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Although she knew that Clinton often gave away his ties after
wearing them a few times, Lewinsky concluded that this was not a
coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had two very different thoughts. My first thought was, 'You
jerk. You're trying to show me how little your care about me and
how little this meant to you ... to show me you gave it to someone
else,'' she told the grand jury. ``My second thought was that it
was some sort of message of some sort. I don't know what. ... I
thought there was some sort of deliberateness to it. ``
</P>
<P>
   Again, Rubinstein said such a reaction is not unusual. Giving
away such a carefully chosen tie would be a slap in the face to
many women, making them think ``I gave you something very special
and you gave it away, so you really don't care about my feelings,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky also thought there was a message in Clinton wearing a
tie she had given him around the time she was to testify before the
grand jury. ``The president doesn't wear the same tie twice in one
week, so I didn't know what it meant, but it was some sort of
reminder to me,'' she recounted.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned about the alleged necktie connection, Clinton said he
regularly gave away ties that he had been given. ``There would be
nothing unusual if, in fact, Nelvis had a tie that originally had
come into my tie closet from Monica Lewinsky. It wouldn't be
unusual. It wouldn't be by design,'' he told Starr's investigators.
</P>
<P>
   He said he didn't recall Lewinsky giving him the tie that he
wore around the time of her testimony. In neither instance, he
testified, was he trying to send any sort of signal.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Guild of British Tie Makers has weighed in on the
psychology of Lewinsky's gift selections, Reuters News Service
reported Wednesday from London.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's choice of a yellow tie with a subtle pattern
indicated she envisioned Clinton as caring, romantic and diplomatic
_ but not necessarily as a future mate. If she were looking for an
ideal husband, she would more likely have chosen a plain dark tie,
the Guild suggested.
</P>
<P>
   The tie makers told Reuters that the kind of tie a woman buys
for the man in her life reflects the type of man she thinks, or
wishes, he might be.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, too much can be made of the psychology and symbolism
of neckties. Even Freud said that a cigar is sometimes just a
cigar.

COMMENTARY: LEGACY OF LUST  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating from Tuesday night's file for all needing)   By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He couldn't stop thinking about the thong
underwear. He couldn't believe Monica had pulled up her jacket to
show it off. It so inflamed his imagination. At meetings, at
briefings, at the most unlikely times, his mind suddenly reverted
to the image of those straps, quickening his pulse, making him
catch his breath.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the cigar that undid him. He was driven by the
thought of what had been done with it. Suddenly the capital became
a city of cigars. He saw them wherever he went. They ignited his
desire. When he was alone or talking to other people, he took
secret pleasure in letting smoke rings drift through his mind.
</P>
<P>
   There were times when he worried that he might be a sex addict.
He couldn't stop thinking of Monica: what she wore, when she wore
it, where she wore it, or didn't wear it. Her little letters were
so brazen, promising such wild pleasure. Everything she scribbled,
every gift she gave, mesmerized him.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the power of her voice over him. He knew that
he was entering the dangerous territory of obsession. No matter how
much he heard Monica talk about sex, it was never enough.
</P>
<P>
   He was a busy man. A powerful man. A serious man. But there were
times when all he could remember were the sizzling phone
conversations. They filled his head like a drug. People warned him
that he was endangering his legacy. Friends and strangers tried to
pull him back from the brink of his single-mindedness. But it was
too late.
</P>
<P>
   He had become the helpless victim of his cravings for ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   The big picture was lost. He hungered only for the details, all
the stirring and seamy particulars. Nothing was too small or
insignificant for him to consider, to turn over and over in his
unappeasable mind.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to think about her eating cherry chocolates. He
imagined her wrapped up like Cleopatra in the Rockettes blanket or
panting in that Black Dog T-shirt. He kept seeing her in that blue
Gap dress. It was too tight, and he was glad. Again and again he
was visited by images of a man's roving lips. He knew it was wrong.
But he liked to dip into sin. He needed a release from all the
pressure, from the extraordinary responsibilities of a very public
man.
</P>
<P>
   When he went to church on Sundays, he wrestled with his
conscience. He even wondered if he needed professional help.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he worried that he was abusing his power and hurting
the country. He even fretted that the Constitution itself might be
damaged by his obsession.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes it wasn't easy to behold all the human damage that
he already had caused: ruining a young woman's life, dragging all
sorts of people through the muck, wounding reputations and
bankrupting those who came near him. Would the presidency survive
his lust? It didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   Every time he heard those words _ inappropriate intimate
contact, sex of any kind in any manner, shape or form, arousing or
gratifying as defined in definition 1 _ he felt a fire burn.
</P>
<P>
   He had his own definition of sex. Still, he was drawn to the
endless discussion of the existential meaning of sex _ its forms,
its uses. He was a lawyer, but this was not just tortured legalism.
This was tortured eroticism. He liked to parse the lurid definition
over and over and over again, gaining pleasure from repetition:
``breasts,'' ``genitalia,'' ``inserted,'' ``stain.''
</P>
<P>
   His acolytes and subordinates became agents of shamelessness. It
seemed that everyone around him, everyone in the city, everyone in
the country, was talking about what he wanted to hear. All of them
had become his collaborators in perversity. He was spending
millions and millions of dollars to drag an entire nation down to
his twisted level.
</P>
<P>
   He knew how strong he was. He was the most powerful man in the
land. He could reach into every recess of the government to satisfy
himself. And the prospect of impeachment didn't frighten him.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the more he fixated on the strap of that thong, the
more certain he was that he could hang Bill Clinton with it. And,
of all those naughty words he loved to hear, none filled him with
more pleasure than ``impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, nobody could impeach him. He was Ken Starr.

MARK McGWIRE'S RED-HOT; BROTHER DAN IS NOT 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Mark McGwire's home-run chase has me wondering: What happened
to his brother Dan's NFL career? _ G.P., Grapevine
</P>
<P>
   A: Dan McGwire was cut by the Miami Dolphins before the 1996
season and did not catch on with either the New Orleans Saints or
the World League of American Football the next year. He isn't on an
NFL roster.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Seahawks made McGwire the 16th overall pick in the
1991 draft, but he started only five games before being released in
1995. His career numbers in the NFL: 745 passing yards, two
touchdowns and six interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Sportswriters aren't kind to Mark McGwire's younger sibling, who
at 6-foot-8 was one of the NFL's tallest quarterbacks. Last year,
``Sports Illustrated'' included him in a list of the 10 worst draft
picks of the preceding decade.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Paul Harvey mentioned a Bill Clinton watch in which he has
Pinocchio's nose. Where can I order this? _ F.A., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: The Clinton Growing Nose Watch is sold by the Worldwide Watch
Co. of Seattle for $29.95 plus $3.95 shipping. To order, call (800)
535-0131 or visit the Web site www.worldwidewatch.com.
</P>
<P>
   The leather-banded quartz watch has a caricature of President
Clinton on its face, and his nose triples in length every 10
seconds before repeating the process.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide Watch started producing the novelty watch in early
August. National Sales Manager Al Johnson said that the phone
``hasn't stopped ringing'' since Clinton's televised apology speech
Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``We completely underestimated the response,'' Johnson said.
``We're scrambling to keep up.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the cost of a baseball that all the Major League teams
use? _ M.B.R., Graham
</P>
<P>
   A: The cost of an official baseball is $9. Rawlings Sporting
Goods, the manufacturer of all baseballs used in the Major Leagues
since 1976, ships teams from 600,000 to 750,000 balls each year.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those balls never see action in a game. ``The quantity
of balls used in games are just a portion of the baseballs we
ship,'' Rawlings executive Jim Tietjens told the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch in 1993. ``If you've ever been in a major-league
clubhouse, you always see boxes of balls out for players to
autograph.''  &QL;

`JESSE' IS A GROWN-UP ROLE FOR APPLEGATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christina Applegate, whom you might remember as the slutty,
dimwitted Kelly Bundy on ``Married ... With Children,'' is darn
near unrecognizable the first time you see her as the harried
single mom in ``Jesse.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the clothes. She's wearing some.
</P>
<P>
   Not that NBC and the series' well-heeled creators (the snappy,
one-liner specialists who invented ``Friends'') have gone cold
turkey, forsaking Applegate's obvious skill at smoldering. There
are just enough shots of Applegate's Jesse in a low-cut,
off-the-shoulder, cleavage-revealing barmaid get-up to satisfy
those in dire need. In fact, Jesse is sexy enough to attract plenty
of wannabe suitors. To scare off the boorish ones, she has her
10-year-old son, Little John (Eric Lloyd), leap into their laps
with a scream of ``Daddy!'' Talk about panic.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from its first episode, ``Jesse'' looks like a sweet,
gentle sitcom with charm, but it's a little hard to tell what's in
store. To say ``promising'' is vague, but that's the best I can
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse's father, John (George Dzundza), owns a German-themed
restaurant/bar where Jesse works. There, she converses with her pal
and confidante, the man-crazy Linda (Liza Snyder), a bawdy
loudmouth who seems to have strolled off the set of ``Costello.''
</P>
<P>
   At home, Jesse, 26, toils as surrogate mother and housemaid to
her father and a pair of strange brothers. Younger brother Darren
(David DeLuise), is the prototype get-rich-quick schemer. Other
brother John Jr. (John Lehr) hasn't said a word in a year. He
merely nods, grimaces and gestures with his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse is the responsible, level-headed one in a gallery of
nitwits. She's realistic and empathetic without being a bore. I'm
assuming that part of her maturity comes from having to grow up
fast; if her son is 10, she had him at 16.
</P>
<P>
   Because ``Jesse'' has the look and feel of the working-class
sitcom, it could very well be the ``Roseanne'' replacement everyone
appears to seeking. There's even a bigot. John's first words in the
first episode are about William Shatner being Jewish. ``I just
never pictured those people in space,'' he says, to no one in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   As for Applegate, she is surprisingly sharp at playing referee,
mom and jokester, delivering a fluid, articulate banter that fits
well with the show's mixture of implicit lessons of single
motherhood and jokey one-liners.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Applegate's supporting cast has been saddled with
cliche characterizations. But there will be time to fix that.
``Jesse'' is nestled between ``Friends'' and ``Frasier'' on NBC's
powerful Thursday night, when a dark screen would get good ratings.

APPLEGATE'S TALENT SAVES AN AVERAGE `JESSE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jesse Warner has dreams. At 26, she wants the best for the
10-year-old son she's raising alone, she'd like to go to nursing
school, and she wouldn't mind a little time for romance.
</P>
<P>
   Her struggle to realize these dreams while waiting tables in her
father's bar is the premise of ``Jesse,'' making its debut Thursday
night in NBC's can't-miss slot between ``Friends'' and ``Frasier.''
Christina Applegate (``Married . . . With Children'') is a charming
and sympathetic Jesse, but the show itself isn't nearly as winsome.
</P>
<P>
   Blame Jesse's family. Her father, son and two brothers get the
hokiest, most unimaginative lines in the pilot episode, bringing
everything down a couple of notches. Actually, one brother doesn't
get any lines; for philosophical reasons, he has chosen not to
speak. Only Jesse's moments with her next-door neighbor, Diego
(Bruno Campos), have an authentic ring.
</P>
<P>
   Diego is a one-man warm front from Chile _ a smarter Joey
Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc) from ``Friends,'' a suaver Luis Rivera
(Nestor Carbonell) from ``Suddenly Susan.'' Campos, in fact, has
guest-starred as Rivera's brother on ``Susan.''
</P>
<P>
   But therein lies another problem. ``Jesse'' is so much like
other NBC comedies that it is barely distinguishable. If it weren't
for Applegate's considerable ability as a performer _ yes, that
ditzy sexpot Kelly Bundy on ``Married . . . With Children'' was all
an act _ ``Jesse'' would be another painfully average sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the experts all agree that ``Jesse'' will do well because
of its Thursday night positioning. Advertising Age magazine
estimates ``Jesse'' is already commanding the seventh-highest ad
rate in prime time _ $325,000 for a 30-second spot _ without ever
having aired.
</P>
<P>
   With expectations so high, ``Jesse'' may never be able to
deliver. The show is from Bright/Kauffman/Crane Productions, the
same outfit that created ``Friends'' and another beneficiary of
NBC's Thursday night thunder, ``Veronica's Closet,'' which had a
promising debut last year and ended up as disappointing as the
president's TV testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The producers have actually admitted they didn't follow through
very well on ``Veronica's Closet.'' That's nice, but it raises a
huge question about ``Jesse,'' which has a similar birthing history
and the same midwife as ``Veronica's Closet'': director James
Burrows, a co-creator of ``Cheers.''
</P>
<P>
   Burrows, the dean of sitcom directors, hires out to direct about
a half-dozen pilots each season; then goes off on other projects
and the shows are left in hands far less capable. But where
``Veronica's Closet'' started off with a very polished pilot last
year, ``Jesse'' starts off badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse'' takes place in Buffalo, so get ready for the rust-belt
jokes and the ``big snow'' episode, which Hollywood always finds
amusing. Applegate's character works in her father's working-class
tavern, Der Biergarten, where Jesse has to dress in a Bavarian
getup reminiscent of the label on a bottle of St. Pauli Girl.
</P>
<P>
   George Dzundza plays John Warner Sr., Jesse's dad, in full Dark
Ages nincompoopitude, borrowing from every other lovable bigot that
TV has created. Then there's the dimwit brother (David DeLuise),
the not-too-bright fellow waitress (Jennifer Milmore) and the
assorted low-lifes who patronize the place.
</P>
<P>
   In this group, it's not hard for Jesse to look brighter than a
20-watt bulb. But Applegate's presence and her sense of timing
really do stand out in a show that, in the grand tradition of the
Buffalo Bills, seems to be collapsing around her.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse. Half-hour comedy about a harried single mother who rarely
makes time for herself. Starring Christina Applegate, Bruno Campos,
George Dzundza, David DeLuise, Eric Lloyd, John Lehr and Jennifer
Milmore. Premieres Thursday night, NBC. Check local
listings.Parental guideline rating: TV-PG.

MISS AmERICA AND I, WE GO WAY BACK 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. _ Vanna White, the ``Wheel of Fortune''
letter-turner, turned up on one of the local TV stations the other
day, gushing about how wonderful it is to be in Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   Vanna said that the last time she came to town, there were only
a few casinos. Now, she said, the Boardwalk is ablaze with bright
lights and alive with pulse-quickening activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart was just pounding, I was so excited,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   I know the feeling. My heart was pounding the other day, too.
But it wasn't from the unbridled excitement that permeates
``America's Favorite Playground.'' It was from the fear of being
mugged as I walked along Pacific Avenue, a street that is only a
block off the Boardwalk but a million miles away from the wealth
and glitter of the casino/hotels that make Vanna's heart flutter.
</P>
<P>
   When I first came to Atlantic City in 1981, three years after
gambling stormed the Boardwalk, there were only Resorts
International and a few others. I saw Frank Sinatra at Resorts
sometime later, on a night when he was at the top of his game, and
it was a memory to last a lifetime. Seeing Sinatra in person,
holding the audience in the palm of his hand in the intimate
setting of a casino showroom, I understood how he earned the title
``Chairman of the Board.''
</P>
<P>
   I saw Sinatra on my second trip to Atlantic City. I might never
have come near the place even once if my boss at the newspaper
where I worked in Pennsylvania hadn't suggested that I drive down
to Atlantic City and write some columns about the Miss America
Pageant.
</P>
<P>
   An all-expense paid trip to the beach? Why not?
</P>
<P>
   The Miss America contest _ which I had watched on television but
had never seen in person _ turned out to be an intriguing mix of
show business and cutthroat competition. The pageant went about its
business as if it were a Broadway opening, the Academy Awards and
the Super Bowl all rolled into one.
</P>
<P>
   The pageant retains some of its show-biz magic even today, when
Miss America is marketed as a ``socially motivated activist'' who
grapples with major issues of the day. And the competition is
probably more intense than ever as contestants battle for large
sums of scholarship money and a high-profile, international forum
to promote their causes and their careers.
</P>
<P>
   If memory serves, I picked the winner in that 1981 Miss America
Pageant. I was standing at the end of the runway during the
preliminary swimsuit competition, and a woman standing next to me
asked, ``Have you figured out who's going to win?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here she is now,'' I replied, pointing toward Miss Arkansas,
who happened to be walking down the runway at that very moment.
Miss Arkansas was tall and gorgeous and exuded the sort of
all-American charm that has always been one of the major
qualifications for the job of Miss America.
</P>
<P>
   If she had a social conscience, it wasn't showing on that
particular night.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Arkansas' name was Elizabeth Ward, and she looked for all
the world like the girl next door. Her talent in the Miss America
Pageant was singing, but she wanted to be a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Sure she did. Ward is an actress these days and calls herself
Elizabeth Gracen. She recently confessed to having a one-night
stand with Bill Clinton when he was governor of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the girl next door.
</P>
<P>
   My next trip to the Miss America Pageant was in 1986. My
newspaper sponsored the local pageant that produced Miss
Pennsylvania that year, and the reporter who was supposed to write
about her in Atlantic City couldn't make it. They drafted me.
</P>
<P>
   No excuses in 1989 and '90. I just wanted to be here to watch
Miss Texas compete for the title that has eluded the Lone Star
State since 1974. I vowed that the 1990 trip would be my last.
</P>
<P>
   But then I met the remarkable Tatum Hubbard. So I journeyed to
the Jersey Shore one more time, to root for Miss Texas in the Miss
America Pageant.
</P>
<P>
   And what the heck. As long as I'm here, I think I'll go out on
the Boardwalk and look for Vanna White.  &QL;

CUBICLE MAKEOVERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JULIE V. IOVINE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who works in a cubicle knows that its shroudlike
isolation bears no resemblance to real privacy. But it may come as
a surprise that the people who design today's office systems agree
that cubicles are long overdue for a makeover.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think about having to go to a box every day and perform
a job in one of those little spaces, it doesn't seem human,'' said
Ross Lovegrove, a British designer who was asked by the Herman
Miller company _ which introduced the precursor to the cubicle
concept in the '60s _ to help give new life to the spaces where
roughly 60 percent of America's white-collar work force toils.
</P>
<P>
   The system that the design team developed, which looks in part
like a marauding raptor, might have been conceived for Sigourney
Weaver's console in ``Aliens.'' It is intended as an antidote to
the piles of cables snaking around workers' feet.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the computer mantra ``plug and play,'' it consists
of components that build up from the floor, rather than
cantilevering from shoulder-height panels. A slick shell of
translucent honeycombed plastic, it stands on silvery birdlike legs
that attach directly to floor tiles, integrating the floor into the
structure and masking cables for the computer, telephone and
lights.
</P>
<P>
   The approach was to think inside out. ``As we move further away
from pencil and paper, the support technology needed to convey
voice, power and data becomes massive,'' Lovegrove said. ``The
infrastructure of even 10 years ago can't handle it.'' The goal was
to transform the cubicle into a thing of ``lightness and grace,''
he said. The system is also a lot easier to break down and
reconfigure, a priority for office managers reared on notions of
``high churn'' (turnover) and faced with good old downsizing.
</P>
<P>
   The ``privacy'' this system will provide is open to
interpretation: an assortment of ethereal cotton-spandex screens
that flex like wings can be snapped in place to offer some
semblance of visual and audio separation. (They look great, but
will they do the trick when a colleague is ranting on the phone at
a spouse?) And then there are the file boxes: stacks of perforated
plastic that bear an uncanny resemblance to the milk crates that
another generation used to store LPs.
</P>
<P>
   Still a prototype, the product _ known informally as Emma, after
a grandmother of someone on the design team's staff _ is a
collaboration between Interface Architectural Resources, a carpet
manufacturer, and Herman Miller, the second largest manufacturer of
office furniture in the country and no stranger to office
innovation since it introduced the Action Office in 1964.
Lovegrove's partner on the team was Stephen Peart, a designer who
lives near San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The system was previewed in June at Neocon, the trade show for
the commercial furniture industry. ``Everyone was buzzing around
saying, `You've got to see it,''' said Shashi Caan, a senior
designer at Gensler, an architectural interiors firm.
``Functionally, it wasn't all that new. Conceptually, it was
fascinating. By simplifying all the parts and pieces and letting
them be the decorations themselves, it made a really strong
statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were most impressed by the Legolike components, which can
be built up to accommodate a single worker or a team. ``It comes as
close to real building blocks as I've ever seen,'' said Roger Yee,
editor of Contract Design, a trade magazine. ``All the parts are
universal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't presume how you're going to use it,'' Yee said _
whether in a traditional office with freestanding furniture or in a
cubicle arrangement. He said the system ``is honest enough to say
it doesn't know the shape of the office of the future.''
</P>

   But in a business bred on brown laminates, the translucent
plastic _ inspired by ``the economy of such natural structures as
honeycombs,'' Lovegrove said _ raised the most eyebrows. Kent
Gawart, a business development executive at Herman Miller, which
hopes to introduce the system next year, said many people at Neocon
thought the plastic ``went way beyond being viable.''
</P>
<P>
   So it's back to the drawing board for a few more embellishments
_ namely a nice mahogany desktop, the kind the boss always gets.

<P>
   In the battle for dinnertime, technology has favored the
telemarketers lately, with computerized dialers and more
sophisticated data bases making it easier for telephone solicitors
to reach unsuspecting consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Caller ID is a big help in figuring out who is on the other end
of the ring, but many times the display shows an unhelpful message
like ``blocked'' or ``out of range.'' If a consumer picks up the
telephone to figure out who it is, the caller sometimes end up
being a telemarketer.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the Ameritech Corp., the Midwest's dominant local
telephone company, unveiled a new service, Privacy Manager, that
could help solve that problem.
</P>
<P>
   Think of Privacy Manager as an electronic doorman. If a call
comes in that would not display a name on a Caller ID box, the call
is first intercepted by a voice asking that the caller state their
identity. Only then does the phone actually ring, and the consumer
can hear who is calling before deciding whether to take the call,
skip it, or play a message telling telemarketers to go away.
</P>
<P>
   A bit cumbersome, perhaps, but effective. Privacy Manager is
available now only in Chicago and Detroit, but Ameritech plans to
introduce the service throughout its region next year. Other local
phone companies will be able to license the Privacy Manager
technology from Ameritech and from Lucent Technologies Inc.
beginning next February.
</P>
<P>
   Ameritech is charging $3.95 a month for the service, on top of
the mandatory Caller ID service, which costs about $9 a month.

   A popular way to buy, trade and download music on the Internet
may just get more popular. The Rio PMP 300, created by Diamond
Multimedia Systems of San Jose, Calif., is a portable music player
that is about the size of a pager and does a lot more than beeps.
</P>
<P>
   A departure with Walkman-like music players that use cassette
tapes, compact disks or more recently re-introduced, mini-disks,
The Rio canstore up to 60 minutes of digital-quality music directly
into its 32-MB memory. Because it can only handle music that is
compressed in the MP3 format, the Rio comes with software that also
permits users to convert music on CDs into the MP3 format.
</P>
<P>
   A major feature of the Rio, which is expected to ship to
retailers next month with a suggested price of $200, is that cuts
the tether that has previously tied MP3 music listeners to their
computers. Other advantages: the tiny Rio can run for 12 hours on a
single AA alkaline battery and, during a recent demonstration, it
proved to be highly resistant to flutter and skip, something that
just might cause the hearts of some mobile music lovers to skip a
beat.

   If you are one of the dozens of Americans who cannot get enough
of the Clinton-Lewinsky saga, a California company called Netflix
has just the thing for you: President Clinton's four-hour Grand
Jury testimony is now available on a DVD disk.
</P>
<P>
   And it is only two cents, plus $2 shipping and handling.
</P>
<P>
   Netflix (www.netflix.com), the first company to rent and sell
DVD movie titles over the Internet, announced Monday that it would
make ``resident Clinton's Grand Jury Testimony'' _ catchy title,
eh? _ available on DVD disk for $9.95, or $4 for a seven-day
rental.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday the company cut the sale price to $0.02 ``o
encourage public education regarding these history-making events.''
</P>
<P>
   The videotaped testimony has been digitized and segmented into
99 chapters, allowing DVD owners to search for specific educational
highlights, or lowlights.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton's Grand Jury Testimony,'' which stars
William Jefferson Clinton in the title role, is rated NC-17
(children are effectively barred from buying the disk because the
Netflix online store requires a credit card). Reviews have been
mixed.

   On Oct. 12, at the annual Microsoft Professional Developer
Conference, at least eight personal computer makers are planning to
exhibit their new ``Jupiter-class'' mini-notebook computers.
Jupiter is the code name for Windows CE 3.0, the latest version of
the consumer electronics operating system that Microsoft is
introducing that day.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the generic term for the new generation of portables
that are smaller than conventional subnotebook computers, but
larger than the palm-size computers like the 3COM Corp.'s popular
Palm Pilot III.
</P>
<P>
   A few Jupiter-class computers began appearing earlier this year,
but they are expected to proliferate in coming months, with new
models being introduced by such companies as Acer, Compaq, Fujitsu,
Hewlett-Packard, IBM, LG Electronics, NEC, Philips and Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   The Jupiter devices typically cost $1,000 or less, weigh about 2
pounds and have a battery life of at least 5 hours. The keyboards
are usually scrunched and the color screens are relatively small,
but the Jupiter machines can handle electronic mail, web browsing,
word processing, scheduling and contact management, and other
simple PC tasks.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Jupiter machines are often described as ``companion PCs,''
since they are designed to be mobile accessories for desktop
computer owners.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts think the Jupiter-class devices will cut into
sales of full-size notebook computers, appealing to travelers who
find even the slimmest 4-pound notebooks too heavy or too
expensive.

   America Online wants to get its software into the computers of
as many consumers as possible, and in doing so the world's largest
Internet and online service provider has sometimes been accused of
carpet-bombing the country with millions of 3.5-inch diskettes. No
more.
</P>
<P>
   Starting next week, AOL will begin precision-bombing the country
with millions of CD-ROM disks containing version 4.0 of AOL's
software.
</P>
<P>
   As in the past, consumers will find disks stuffed into
mailboxes, cereal boxes, newspaper wrappers, airline snack packs
and magazine inserts, and perhaps even stuffed in packages of
frozen steaks. They will be distributed at banks, gas stations,
shopping malls ``and anywhere consumers go,'' a company spokeswoman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although finding an AOL diskette stuffed into a package of
frozen steaks might lead one to suspect otherwise, the AOL
spokeswoman insisted that the company has a methodical distribution
strategy for the CD-ROMs. (It did test the diskettes to make sure
they could withstand freezing.)
</P>
<P>
   Version 4.0, which was introduced in July, is widely regarded as
a welcome update to AOL's software. But really, how many AOL CD-ROM
disks does one need? Besides making handy drink coasters, the
diskettes can also be disposed of by surreptitiously dropping them
into children's candy bags on Halloween.

   It's hardly surprising that when the Starr Report went online
earlier this month, most readers skipped the legalese and made a
bee-line for the more salacious sections. But the extent to which
people's online reading habits can be dissected became clear when
Net Ratings, a Web audience measurement company, released figures
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on a panel of number voluntary, anonymous Web users, Net
Ratings measured the pages viewed by visitors to the MSNBC at the
time of the report's release. Some 71 percent of readers went to
the section titled, ``Nature of President Clinton's Relationship
with Monica Lewinsky,'' and another 44 percent were drawn to the
section called ``1995: Initial Sexual Encounters.'' Interest fell
precipitously _ to 4 percent _ for the part titled, ``pril-December
1996: No Private Meeting'', then jumped again, to 27 percent, for
``Early 1997: Resumption of Sexual Encounters.'' Only 2 percent, on
the other hand, perused the chapters titled ``The Subpoena'' and
``The Affidavit.''

   Just how powerful is the Net as a grass-roots political tool?
Joan Blades and Wes Boyd plan to find out. On Tuesday, the two the
founders of Berkeley Systems, famous for its bestselling After Dark
screen saver, posted a petition on the Web (www.moveon.org),
inviting fellow citizens to express collective disgust at
Washington's protracted preoccuption with President Clinton's
relationship with Monica Lewinsky and urge Congress to turn its
attention to more important matters.
</P>
<P>
   The petition calls for Congress to ``mmediately censure
President Clinton and move on to pressing issues facing the
country.'' Once a visitor to the site endorses the petition, it is
automatically transmitted to ``key members of Congress,'' and the
president.
</P>
<P>
   This new project, said Ms. Blades, called ``Censure and Move
On,'' came as a result of being ``absolutely sick to death of how
the media and the government have been focused on a scandal rather
than the business that needs to get done.''

   Purple Moon, the software company whose ``riendship adventures''
cater to pre-teen girls, is getting ready to entice budding
shoppers into getting adventurous with their weekly allowance.
</P>
<P>
   Friday Purple Moon will launch an online shopping center on its
Web site (www.purple-moon.com), featuring backpacks, CD-ROMs,
watches and other items related to the narrative world of
characters in the Purple Moon games.
</P>
<P>
   The Purple Moon Store contains a section where girls can build a
wish list of items and send it to friends and relatives, who can
then visit the site on their own and make the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Girls can also buy swappable digital ``treasures,'' like the
endangered Siberian Tiger, or sparkling gems, which are available
in Beanie Baby-style limited editions.
</P>
<P>
   According to Purple Moon's market research, high among parents'
priorities is a desire to teach their children basic money
management skills. (Parents will have access to their daughters'
lists and, unless the child has a gift certificate, a parent must
be present _ credit card in hand _ when a purchase is made.)
``Parents were very interested in using this to teach girls basic
finance concepts,'' said Amy Robinson, a Purple Moon senior
manager.

<P>
   It looks like an ugly hunk of iron. Its machinery shares space
with wasps' nests and an occasional skunk. It has more rust than
the Titanic. But it's the same model your father drove, or the same
one you supported your family with. Or maybe it's just one you've
always heard about. And what keeps you working on it through the
cuts and bruises is the knowledge that _ unlike the family car _
its parts are usually designed to be fixed easily.
</P>
<P>
   It's an old tractor, and restoring, collecting and showing them
is very popular. It's very American. It's also very understandable
in places where you live by, and on, your tools, where recycling is
necessity, not ecology, and where people open antique stores
instead of throwing stuff out.
</P>
<P>
   The first stop on any Web tractor tour should be Roger Welsch's
home page &UR; (www.micrord.com/rogerwelsch) &LR; . Welsch, a former
professor and the sage of Dannebrog, Neb., is the host of the
``Postcards From Nebraska'' reports on television for ``CBS Sunday
Morning,'' and the author of many books, including ``Old Tractors
and the Men Who Love Them'' (Motorbooks International, 1995). He is
to tractor restoration, and the Allis-Chalmers WC in particular,
what Thoreau was to the lakeside cabin. For details, you can buy
his books, but his Web site will put you in the right mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as tractors kind of exploded on me, so did the Web,''
Welsch wrote by e-mail. ``Now I haunt the Web and use it hourly.
For tractors, too. There are two sites I like and use _ the ATIS
site  &UR; (www.atis.net/) &LR;  and any of the multiple sites (including my
tall-tale site) at agriculture.com.''
</P>
<P>
   The ATIS (Antique Tractor Internet Services) site _ its motto is
``Plow the 'Net'' _ calls itself ``the largest, oldest and the
original antique tractor Web site on the planet, bar none.'' It
gets as many as 1,000 visits a day, and the numbers appear to be
climbing. It began operation in 1993 as a nopnprofit site but
became so popular that it soon became a business. It still says it
is a ``community of friends,'' but besides voluminous listings of
shows, discussion groups, links and free mailing lists (which the
site refers to as a ``support group''), it sells advertisements,
acts as a host for Web pages and offers electronic mailboxes and a
fine assortment of fashion accessories, among other services.
</P>
<P>
   Its Frequently Asked Questions include ``What Implements Do I
Need?'' and ``Does Tractor Restoration Require a Mechanical
Background?'' One FAQ page talks about ``How to Transport Your
Tractor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Show tractors should be as close to the original as
possible,'' the site notes.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 707 members in the site's database profile, only 33, or 5
percent, call themselves as commercial farmers, and another 44, or
6 percent, say they are in a farm-related profession, said Jim
Poole, the profile administrator. (``He works for free T-shirts and
hats,'' said the site's owner, Spencer Yost.) The states with the
most profiled members are Texas, California, Pennsylvania, Ohio and
New York. John Deere and International Harvester are virtually tied
for the most common tractors in the database, with Ford and
Allis-Chalmers runners-up.
</P>
<P>
   Something is going on here that transcends machinery, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since ATIS' inception, it has been my goal to create a true
human community on the Internet, complete with decency, civility,
real friendships backed up with face-to-face meetings (we have
annual gatherings) and a willingness to help and to uplift each
other,'' Yost, founder of ATIS, wrote by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Yost grew up in a suburb of Atlanta and, as a child, imagined
himself riding the rusty machines in the field next door. A stint
in the Forest Service acquainted him with a number of north Georgia
mountain farmers who used antique equipment. He started ATIS as a
mailing list in 1993 because he had bought himself a 1946 Farmall A
and wanted an easy way for him and others to get technical
information. The site grew like Iowa corn.
</P>
<P>
   Yost now owns several tractors and says he likes Massey Harris
the best. ``Yes, there are extremely rare tractors,'' he wrote,
``such as a 730 LP (liquid propane fuel) High Crop (the tractor is
taller for higher crops) that sold recently for $56,000 (John Deere
Expo auction, 1998).'' But unlike other collectors, he said,
tractor buffs are motivated less by rarity and investment value
than by sentiment, utility and fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antique tractors,'' he says in the site, ``are simply a
touchstone we use to understand and find our place in history, in
our own lives and within the greater community of mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ageless Iron''
 &UR; (www.agriculture.com/sfonline/archive/sf/ageless/agiindex.html) &LR; ,
a Web page from Successful Farming magazine, offers photos of
tractors from the Ageless Iron Art Gallery, and tractor trading
cards. Dean Vinson's Farm Life page
 &UR; (www.geocities.com/Heartland/Acres/4901) &LR;  evokes rural Americana
as well as hints for newcomers and special advice on buying or
selling the Farmall M model. Chuck Bealke of Dallas has a site
 &UR; (web2.airmail.net/bealke/rollagshow.htm) &LR;  devoted to the 1997
Labor Day steam thresher show in Rollag, Minn., that is worth
seeing just for the pictures and the people.
</P>
<P>
   Bealke, who uses expressions like ``Dream of Steam'' and ``Lust
for Rust,'' also has a compact index of tractor museums by state
 &UR; (www.atis.net/museums.html) &LR; . His main Web page, Chuck's
Tractorstuf  &UR; (web2.airmail.net/bealke/tractors.htm) &LR;  is a
comprehensive and warmly written complement to the ATIS pages, with
many links.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me,'' Bealke wrote by e-mail, ``the people in this
endeavor are just as much fun as the tractors. I just got back from
three AT shows in Ohio and met several fine fellows I would like to
live up the road from.''

light bulb? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Aries: Just one. You want to make something of it?
</P>
<P>
   Taurus: One, but just TRY to convince them that the burned-out
one is useless and should be thrown away.
</P>
<P>
   Gemini: Two, but the job never gets done _ they just keep
arguing about who is supposed to do it and how it's supposed to be
done!
</P>
<P>
   Cancer: Just one. But it takes a therapist three years to help
them through the grief process.
</P>
<P>
   Leo: Leos don't change light bulbs, although sometimes their
agent will get a Virgo in to do the job for them while they're out.
</P>
<P>
   Virgo: Approximately 1.000000 with an error of /- 1 millionth.
</P>
<P>
   Libra: Er, two. Or maybe one. No ... on second thought, make
that two. Is that OK with you?
</P>
<P>
   Scorpio: That secret information can only be shared only with
the Enlightened Ones in the Star Chamber of the Ancient
Hierarchical Order.
</P>
<P>
   Sagittarius: The sun is shining, the day is young, we've got our
whole lives ahead of us, and you're inside worrying about a stupid

</P>
<P>
   Capricorn: I don't waste my time with these childish jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Aquarius: Well, you have to remember that everything is energy,

</P>
<P>

   &UR; BILL'S WORLD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In her grand jury testimony, Monica Lewinsky said she thinks Mr.
Clinton has ``a beautiful soul.'' We had no idea he'd bared that
part of him, too.
</P>
<P>
   There's talk that Mr. Clinton may make a don't-impeach-me plea
directly to Congress. Apparently he's found he can't veto a vote to
impeach.
</P>
<P>
   The president said in his grand jury testimony that he'd
``rather have taken a whipping'' than admit to a sexual encounter
with Gennifer Flowers. Aunt Ilse from Oelwein says if she'd been
married to him he'd have got one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate Linda Tripp,'' Lewinsky told grand jurors. It's hard to
imagine any jury that would convict her for that.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky calls May 24, 1997, the day Mr. Clinton broke off their
relationship, D-Day _ for Dump Day. What a coincidence. It's always
been D-Day to us, too _ for Bob Dylan's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I looked at him,'' Lewinsky said of the president, ``I
saw a little boy.'' She must have been wearing pose-colored
glasses.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee has 16 boxes of still-private
documents in the Clinton inquiry. Maybe the word in this case
should be spelled evidense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot rest,'' says Mr. Clinton, ``until we solve the
oldest, most stubborn, most painful challenge of our nation.'' Hey,
it's not nice to speak that way about Strom Thurmond.
</P>
<P>
   Memo to St. Peter: Don't try to catch up with that flash that
just rocketed by you. It was your new arrival, Florence Griffith
Joyner.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DAVID LETTERMAN LATE SHOW TOP TEN &LR;

A FATHER-TO-BE GRILLS THE AUTHOR OF THE MOST POPULAR PREGNANCY
MANUAL EVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM ROGERS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you want to grout tile, you call Bob Vila. If you want to
learn the Dromedary Droop, you call Heidi Murkoff.
</P>
<P>
   Murkoff, along with her mom and sister, wrote ``What to Expect
When You're Expecting,'' the guidebook to pregnancy. The
enchiridion of incubation. In a recent survey, 93 percent of
pregnant women said they had read the book.
</P>
<P>
   As luck would have it, Murkoff was recently in Fort Worth to
promote ``Qu Se Puede Esperar Cuando Se Est Esperando,'' a new
Spanish translation of ``What to Expect.'' This reporter _ whose
lovely, long-suffering wife is in her sixth month _ ate lunch with
the author. Between dainty bites of chicken Caesar salad, Murkoff
answered fairly nutso questions with delightfully good humor and
grace.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My wife is crazy. Why?
</P>
<P>
   A: Because she's pregnant. Duh! But she is not crazy. There are
legitimate hormonal reasons for it. For years, doctors said that
women complained of being forgetful, it was just in their heads.
Not true. It's like PMS, only magnified, and it lasts for nine
months. It's no wonder you're seeing these changes in her
personality.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My wife doesn't want to find out the baby's sex, but I do.
Tell me I'm right.
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm not going to tell you you're right! It's just a matter of
personal preference. A lot of people enjoy the waiting game. I like
finding out the old-fashioned way.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where is the magical fantasy land where fat, pregnant women
are beautiful?
</P>
<P>
   A: Are you saying your wife's not?
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm not saying that. I would never say that.
</P>
<P>
   A: First of all, there is beauty in the pregnant form. And she's
not fat; she's pregnant. Many men do find that to be sensuous. What
she really needs is to be told that she's gorgeous, especially
these days, with women obsessing about being thin. A lot of women
have trouble with the weight gain, and it's up to the spouse to
say: ``It really becomes you. It looks great on you.'' The big
breasts, for instance. That can be a plus, for some men.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've noticed those.
</P>
<P>
   A: My husband isn't a breast man, so he instead ran screaming
from the room.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So drinking during pregnancy _ that's a bad thing, right? I
mean for the woman?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But my wife wants me to stop, too. Isn't that insane?
</P>
<P>
   A: I said she wasn't crazy. It's not insane. Obviously, it's
easier to get on the wagon if you have company. If you're on the
wagon by yourself, it can be lonely.
</P>
<P>
   Q: None of these are the answers I was looking for. I just
bought a new iMac computer. My wife complains that I spend too much
time on it and not enough with her. Is, say, five hours a day on
the computer, you think, too much?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'd say five hours is a little excessive.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You see? All the wrong answers. I was hoping you'd say six
hours was too much. My wife is demonstrating a phenomenon that you
mention in your book: absent-mindedness and lack of dexterity. Our
car, for instance, has been in the shop for two weeks because of
that lack of dexterity. How long is it appropriate to punish her
for this?
</P>
<P>
   A: You know the answer to that. First of all, in terms of the
hands, there's swelling. She would have less of a grip on the
steering wheel. And there's also a loosening of all the joints and
ligaments, in preparation for childbirth. So that could affect her,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You wrote in your book, I believe on Page 162, ``A pregnant
woman's best friend can be her husband's closet.'' My wife read
that, and so now I hate you. Do you care to respond?
</P>
<P>
   A: Maternity clothes have come a long way since I was pregnant,
when you had to wear these giant floral Laura Ashley things that
made you look like a sofa. So if you're clever about it, you borrow
big shirts and you belt them and they look really cool.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it ever appropriate to tell your pregnant wife, ``I don't
want to hear {t''?
</P>
<P>
   A: You don't want to hear it?
</P>
<P>
   Q: You know, like if she's going on, and then you just say, in a
loving way, ``Hey, I don't want to hear it.''
</P>
<P>
   A: Sorry. She needs that support 24/7.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've been using the analogy that the baby's like a parasite _
drains her energy, lives off the food she eats, makes her sick. Is
this analogy helpful?
</P>
<P>
   A: To her?
</P>
<P>
   Q: In general.
</P>
<P>
   A: Not particularly. But it's very hard to feel connected to
this little invader until it's actually born. So there are times
when you feel resentful. So that's completely natural. But it's
probably not helpful to use that analogy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is everything going to be OK?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are no guarantees when it comes to having a baby. But
the odds are overwhelmingly in your favor.
</P>
<P>
   Q: That's the first good answer you've given.
</P>
<P>
   A: Are you talking about the baby being healthy, or are you
talking about, like, your marriage?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever you feel qualified to speak on.
</P>
<P>
   A: The baby will be fine. I'm more worried about your marriage
than anything else, after listening to these questions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Well, that's about all I got for you.
</P>
<P>
   A: No sex question? You're a man, aren't you? Come on. Don't let
me down.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Uh, I didn't prepare a sex question. ... You know, the
pregnancy didn't slow us down at first. But ... when was the last
time we had sex?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, that's bad. That's bad. Well, wait till you have the
baby.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I guess my wife and I both have been having erotic dreams,
though.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah, well, pregnant women have crazy dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Q: See? I told you she was crazy.

   WOMEN'S SERIES, DAY FIVE: CONFRONTING THE LESBIAN ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN-LESBIAN _ In several ways, sexual orientation is a
significant if largely unspoken factor in women's sports. Regarding
college basketball, some players say particular programs are
labeled as ``heterosexual'' or ``lesbian'' in terms of welcoming
homosexuals. The Georgia coach says that half of the parents of
players he recruits inquires about this issue. This is a prime
example of how the reality of lesbians in sports _ and the
perceptions and misperceptions that result _ could slow the
momentum of women's athletics. (Fish, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
ETA 8 p.m. ET.

emerged as the favorite for the Heisman Trophy after three strong

Couch's first real test, and possibly his biggest of the season,
will come Saturday on the road against Florida. Couch passed for
348 yards and two touchdowns against the Gators last season, but
was also intercepted three times in a 55-28 loss. An impressive

   WOMEN'S SERIES, DAY FIVE: CONFRONTING THE LESBIAN ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN-LESBIAN _ In several ways, sexual orientation is a
significant if largely unspoken factor in women's sports. Regarding
college basketball, some players say particular programs are
labeled as ``heterosexual'' or ``lesbian'' in terms of welcoming
homosexuals. The Georgia coach says that half of the parents of
players he recruits inquires about this issue. This is a prime
example of how the reality of lesbians in sports _ and the
perceptions and misperceptions that result _ could slow the
momentum of women's athletics. (Fish, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   MIAMI _ Hurricane Georges, the strongest storm to ravage the
Caribbean in years, raged across the poor and ill-prepared island
of Hispaniola before marching relentlessly Wednesday through parts
of Cuba and ominously in the direction of South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane's unofficial death toll from Georges' four-day
rampage across the Caribbean soared to 37, including 17 people in
the Dominican Republic, where the storm spawned looting and street
violence.
</P>
<P>
   A hurricane watch was posted for much of South Florida,
including Monroe, Dade, Broward, and Collier counties, and as many
as 100,000 people in the Florida Keys were instructed to evacuate
for the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want people to panic, but we want them to be
prepared,'' said Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas.
</P>
<P>
   Penelas announced that public schools would be closed on
Thursday and Friday ``no matter what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters predicted that Georges, which packed winds of 75 mph
on Wednesday, could intensify and develop into a Category 2
hurricane by the time it nears Florida. But that would be nothing
compared to Hurricane Andrew, which was nearly a Category 5
hurricane that sustained some wind gusts of up to 175 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Still, South Florida residents took the approaching storm
seriously, scarred by memories of Andrew, packing hardware and
grocery stores before 6 a.m. EDT on Wednesday -- long before
sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew created the most costly natural disaster in U.S. history,
inflicting an estimated $30 billion in damage on South Florida in
1992 -- more than four times the costs run up by Hugo, which killed
85 people and lashed the South Carolina coast in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In the normally laid-back Florida Keys, airline ticket counters
were jam-packed with people trying to flee the area, while rental
cars were no where to be found.
</P>
<P>
   Logjams dotted the two-lane Overseas Highway connecting the
110-mile necklace of islands starting at 7 a.m. EDT, when phased-in
evacuations began in the keys.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, White House spokesman Michael McCurry quoted
Federal Emergency Management director James Lee Witt as saying
Georges could possibly be the worst storm to hit the keys since
1935, when an unnamed hurricane killed 405 people.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m. EDT, Georges was centered over the Windward Passage
some 530 miles southeast of Key West. It was moving west-northwest
at 14 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Georges spent Wednesday dumping heavy rain on the easternmost
provinces of Cuba, where two years of drought has reaped
catastrophic crop and livestock losses.
</P>
<P>
   Civil defense officials evacuated 167,000 people from
flood-prone areas in eastern Cuba, while Cuban President Fidel
Castro appeared on television early Wednesday to urge Cuba's 11
million people to maintain calm and ``revolutionary unity.''
</P>
<P>
   But under sunny skies, residents in the Havana area, which were
not expected to see the brunt of the storm, said they had grown
accustomed to powerful storms, and that they were going about
business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people in Cuba are all that nervous because
we're used to getting storms all the time, and it's just part of
living on an island,'' said Yoselinda Atan, a Havana resident.
</P>
<P>
   Georges took its time trampling the island of Hispaniola
overnight Tuesday and didn't move off-shore until after dawn on
Wednesday, nearly 18 hours after it first made landfall.
</P>
<P>
   The island's 10,000-foot peaks slowed winds from 110 mph on
Tuesday to 75 mph early Wednesday, but the storm was expected to
pick up strength once it moved over the warmer, open waters.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dominican Republic, soldiers enforced a curfew in the
capital of Santo Domingo after Georges ravaged that country.
</P>
<P>
   News reports said that bands of youth with pistols had roamed
the streets while looters waded waist-deep in water, carrying
appliances on their heads even in the midst of powerful winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are occupying Santo Domingo to prevent criminal acts, which
we see practically as acts of terrorism,'' said armed forces chief
Ruben Paulino Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti, the hemisphere's poorest country, was sorely unprepared
for Georges' fury, and had mustered only $130,000 this week to deal
with the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities confirmed 13 deaths in Haiti. Six occurred when a
house collapsed in a neighborhood just outside the capital of
Port-au-Prince.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, many Haitians in the capital did not lose power or
phone service as a result of the storm while many roads were still
drivable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been as much damage as was expected,'' said a
spokesman at the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 90 percent of the roads are still passable, although a
100-foot section of the pier was destroyed, so three commercial
vessels in the harbor were cut loose,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Georges began pummeling a string of Caribbean islands last
weekend, sustaining winds on Sunday as high as 150 mph and leaving
several people dead in its wake from collapsed roofs and mudslides.
Insured losses in the Caribbean are expected to exceed $1 billion,
one of the worst Caribbean hurricane losses ever for the insurance
industry.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the sun sneaked down through a cobwebby skylight
onto centuries-old mahogany planks and other architectural remnants
in an old warehouse in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood, Randy
Polumbo pulled out one dusty board after another, hefting a couple
of them onto a table and wetting them down with alcohol to see
their true color.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could put these two together _ like this _ for one of the
smaller kitchen counters,'' he told his client, a jeweler named
Christopher Walling, who was clutching his Jack Russell terrier.
``How much?'' Polumbo asked the sales assistant and was spirited
downstairs for a discussion of prices, while Walling wandered
around, looking for doors for his cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most of the people who take clients to this little-known
spot to find antique wood, Polumbo is not an interior decorator. Or
an architect. Or a general contractor. In a way, he is all of them
_ the owner's personal representative on the job. He is one of a
relatively new breed of home improvement specialists: a
construction manager.
</P>
<P>
   Besides helping his client find old boards for his new kitchen
counters, Polumbo is supervising the entire renovation of Walling's
Upper East Side kitchen, a job that is still in the planning
stages. The two men are brainstorming. As construction manager,
Palumbo is scouting for materials _ and manpower _ at the best
prices and establishing a budget that will change as the design
takes shape. Finally, he will oversee the various tradesmen to be
sure they live up to their estimates on a job that will grow
organically. Many managers agree to split any savings with the
client.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the way things work with the familiar type of
renovator known as a general contractor. General contractors
usually don't go shopping with clients. They seldom brainstorm with
them. And they are almost never involved in a job with a
free-floating budget. When a general contractor submits a bid, he
usually sticks to it, barring changes that are out of his control.
</P>
<P>
   Construction managers (CMs, as they are called) argue that their
more relaxed approach is well suited to sophisticated homeowners
who can read a balance sheet. They say their records are available
for scrutiny at all times. Both they and their clients recite the
words ``teamwork'' and ``trust'' like a mantra.
</P>
<P>
   To their advocates _ which include a raft of homeowners who
praise their construction managers with a devotion that verges on
zealotry _ the system is perfect. It is adaptable, they say,
allowing as much oversight as a client wants to exercise. There is
the comfort of knowing that spending records are always accessible.
The manager is accessible, too, for long-winded discussions on
molding details, and for day trips to marble yards and
architectural salvage depots.
</P>
<P>
   But to their detractors _ including, not surprisingly, many
general contractors _ this approach is full of pitfalls. A budget
that can grow with an owner's whims is a budget that can balloon
out of control. Trust, they say, can quickly turn into
bewilderment, or worse. And many construction managers are
unlicensed. (They say they don't need to be, although New York City
officials interviewed for this article insist that they must be.)
</P>
<P>
   Construction management is not a new field. Managers have been a
part of commercial work for decades. Unlike general contractors,
who must have extensive plans drawn by architects and engineers
before they can bid, construction managers, using more free-flowing
estimates, can often start jobs months earlier _ months that add up
to a lot of money saved, especially when winter is coming.
</P>
<P>
   But construction managers are relatively new in residential
projects, although several hundred are now working in New York City
alone. They have no listing of their own in the Yellow Pages; they
are found by word of mouth, through satisfied clients, architects,
even lumber yards. Several companies, including the huge HRH
Construction Interiors in Manhattan, say they use construction
managers in about 20 percent of their residential work, compared
with none five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Werter, who owns a Brooklyn co-op with her husband,
Henry Trevor, worked with a construction manager, Jon Olsen, on an
elaborate reconstruction of their seven-room prewar apartment
overlooking Prospect Park. She calls the system ``the wave of the
future.'' Ms. Werter was introduced to Olsen by her architect,
Barry Goralnick of Manhattan, and now considers him indispensable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a brother-in-law who's a lawyer, and he just shakes his
head and says, `This guy could run away to Puerto Rico with your
money,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Jon,'' she added with a chuckle, ``that's not been a
concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Werter explained the arrangement: After the team had drafted
a tentative budget, Olsen began researching options. ``He's
completely compulsive,'' she said. ``He'll get 15 bids from
cabinetmakers.'' Then, she said, he left a job supervisor to keep
track of the day-to-day operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you don't have to make all the decisions up front,'' she
said. ``If you decide belatedly to put in elaborate moldings, the
way we did, you won't be charged a premium. You'll be charged what
it costs. We feel very in touch with what we're spending.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever makes you feel comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Many homeowners prefer the set-in-stone price of the general
contractor. But general contractors have no obligation to divulge
what they pay for each item in their bid, which allows them to make
as much profit as they can along the way. (For example, a
contractor might submit a $50,000 overall bid for plumbing, but pay
subcontractors only $30,000 for the work _ giving himself a
legitimate $20,000 profit.) This system, the advocates of
construction management say, may embolden a general contractor to
cut corners on quality.
</P>
<P>
   And if a client doesn't know the cost, for example, of each
kitchen cabinet and wants to add a another one _ the dread ``change
order'' _ he has no way of knowing if he will be gouged for the
extra one.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With a construction manager _ if the system works the way it is
supposed to _the customer will pay $20,000 for a plumbing job that
receives a $20,000 bid. Sometimes the manager will ask for
incentives: If he can show savings over previous bids, or bids that
the owner gets, he gets a portion of the savings, often 40 percent.
There may be a sliding scale: One construction manager said he
gives back 100 percent of savings over $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole different process,'' said Goralnick, who is using
a construction manager at four other projects besides the
Werter-Trevor renovation. ``We bring in the CM at the beginning,
even before we submit drawings to the client. I know what I want to
design, but I don't know what labor costs, what material costs.
Clients have a budget, and I don't want to go off half-cocked and
design, say, granite counter tops, and they love it, and then find
out it doesn't fit in their budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Both general contractors and construction managers usually
charge a percentage of the cost of the job, or in some cases a flat
fee. The proportion ranges from 10 to 30 percent, depending on the
size, location and complexity of the work. A construction manager
often handles the client's money; checks are written and placed in
construction accounts, although some clients prefer to pay the
bills themselves. As Ms. Werter put it, ``The system is all about
trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some construction managers say that money can be saved
with their approach, the cost may end up about the same as with a
general contractor _ a flexible budget, after all, can go up as
well as down. For many clients, the important differences are in
the level of the owner's involvement, the sense of teamwork (with
or without an architect) and, perhaps, the opportunity to do more
fine-tuning on the quality of the work.
</P>
<P>
   But construction managers are not for everyone. Busy clients may
not take the time to inform themselves about detailed work. There
may be arguments over what constitutes savings. There may be
misunderstandings: ``I didn't tell you to use my friend's
carpenter. I just suggested you use him.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the use of construction managers in residential
construction is so new, there is confusion about whether they must
be licensed. Most managers say no licenses are necessary, and they
are supported in this opinion by C. Jaye Berger, a lawyer and
arbitrator who specializes in construction disputes.
</P>
<P>
   But New York City's commissioner of consumer affairs, Jules
Polonetsky, disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very, very clear these guys need to be licensed,''
Polonetsky said. ``They're negotiating to have construction done.
They're supervising the jobs. They don't have to pick up a hammer _
they don't have to bang a nail.''
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner said that his office does not separate
complaints about construction managers from those about
home-improvement contractors as a category. Last year, he said,
there were 778 complaints about home-improvement jobs, a figure
that is second only to complaints about furniture stores. (If a
construction manager does hold a home-improvement contractor's
license, you can find out if any complaints have been lodged
against him by calling the Consumer Affairs Department at (212)
487-4444.)
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to see a license for one critical reason,''
Polonetsky said. ``Don't forget: No matter how much you like the
guy, you're letting a stranger into your home. You're not just
buying something from a store.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're hiring a construction manager, the experts _ the CMs
themselves, the homeowners and consumer advocates _ will tell you
to check the following:
</P>
<P>
   REFERENCES: Don't just look at a list furnished by a CM. Call
the people listed, and, if possible, visit the job site. (Don't be
embarrassed to ask; many clients are proud to show off their
renovations and may feel indebted to their workmen.) Ask questions
about how the team worked and, especially, how disputes, big or
small, were resolved.
</P>
<P>
   INTERVIEWS: Interview as many CMs as possible. You might also
want to interview some general contractors to make sure you
understand the different way they work.
</P>
<P>
   INSURANCE: Subcontractors _ plumbers, electricians _ must
furnish insurance, and if anything goes wrong, a CM would try to
get the subcontractor's insurance to pay. But make sure the CM has
insurance, too, naming you and anyone else who needs to be named _
like your co-op board.
</P>
<P>
   LOCAL LAWS: Because the term ``construction manager'' is still
relatively new, explain the CM's role to your local
consumer-affairs bureau or building department, and determine what
licenses are necessary. Discuss your findings with the CM. If the
company doesn't have a license, and the municipality says it needs
one, the company will have to procure a license.

 &HT;    Hefty box set chronicles country legend from A to Z
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seventy-five years after his birth in rural Alabama and 45 years
since his death at age 29, Hank Williams is back on store shelves
in perhaps the most ambitious box set ever to come out of
Nashville. This exhaustive collection includes just about
everything the lanky legend ever recorded, from the 66 studio
records to sound bites from old radio shows to audio tracks lifted
from long-forgotten kinescopes of early television programs.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a Hank fanatic, this beautifully packaged and
documented project will be the cornerstone of your collection. If
you're only a marginal Hank fan, you might want to opt for a
smaller, greatest-hits package instead. The point here is not just
to hum along with ``Hey Good Lookin'''; it's more of a historical
exercise, much like watching ``Biography'' on A&AMP;E. Rarely
interviewed while he was alive, Williams turns out to be a complex
blend of Southern storyteller, jokester and frequently maudlin
balladeer, as well as a gut-wrenching country singer. The
recordings he made under the pseudonym ``Luke the Drifter'' are
here, mostly syrupy and morose recitations of turn-of the-century
poems. He chats with Minnie Pearl and hawks over-the-counter
medicine with his horribly off-tune first wife, Audrey.
</P>
<P>
   This set is a comprehensive snapshot of the very short
professional career (1946-1953) of the man who virtually shaped
modern country music. Pencil out a weekend and get to know him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Complete Hank Williams''
</P>
<P>
   Hank Williams. 10-CD boxed set. Mercury.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Everything you ever wanted to know about Hank _ and
maybe more.

 &HT;    Audio Reviews: The latest word on the latest sounds

<P>
   -- ROCK
</P>
<P>
   ``Speak of the Devil''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Isaak. Reprise. 14 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   No, this isn't Chris Isaak's tribute to Ozzy Osbourne. Still,
it's nearly that surprising. After years of mining the same muted,
haunted groove best used on the 1989 hit ``Wicked Game,'' Isaak has
made an album that actually rocks. Stripped of his patented vocal
reverb and twang bar affectations, the San Francisco singer beefs
up his Roy Orbison-influenced croon and cranks the guitars up to
11. True, the lyrics traffic in the overly familiar _ ``Flying''
recounts an all-too-brief affair and ``Breaking Apart'' is, well,
self-explanatory. But the zesty delivery gives these old themes a
new sheen. The rap on Isaak has long been that, if you've heard one
album, you've heard them all. But with this exhilaratingly
different release, he earns another look.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Early Burglary Years''
</P>
<P>
   Morrissey. Reprise. 16 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Some artists' recorded leftovers are almost as tasty as their
main courses _ Van Morrison's recent vault-clearing collection
``Philosopher's Stone'' comes to mind. Alas, Morrissey, Britain's
master of mope, seems to have only crumbs left in his cupboard.
``My Early Burglary Years,'' a roundup of B-sides, previously
import-only singles and a live cover of the T. Rex classic ``Cosmic
Dancer,'' skimps on the gorgeous melancholy that infuses the
singer's best work. There are a few gems, though. ``Michaels
Bones'' is a haunting rumination on the death of a young friend.
And Morrissey's mournful style proves an exceptional match for
``Cosmic Dancer''; too bad the track is marred by the screams of a
deliriously adoring audience.

</P>
<P>
   Don't panic: He hasn't sold out. Joshua Bell, that onetime
prodigy who has blossomed into one of the top violin talents of our
time, here brings the same combination of technical finesse and
sensitivity that he does to more strictly classical fare. The
centerpiece of his Sony Classical debut, after 13 discs on London,
is Alexander Courage's new setting of George Gershwin's ``Porgy and
Bess'' for violin and orchestra. Bell's approach is direct and
non-syrupy; ``I've Got Plenty o' Nuttin''' has swagger and dash,
while ``My Man's Gone Now'' is rendered with the sobbing
plaintiveness of a top-notch vocalist. Also here are Jascha
Heifetz's Gershwin transcriptions.

   ``How We Quit the Forest''
</P>
<P>
   Rasputina. Columbia.15 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Merging gothic pop-rock with a chamber music sensibility, this
New York trio of female cellists is nothing if not original. Led by
singer-songwriter Melora Creager, a classically trained cellist who
once backed Nirvana, Rasputina creates darkly pretty music with a
menacing edge: Imagine the Bangles covering Marilyn Manson. On
``Forest,'' the trio sheds the shock-rock trappings of its 1986
debut, ``Thanks for the Ether,'' to create a more balanced,
accessible album of short, well-crafted pop tunes. Wielding their
cellos like noisy Stratocasters, the trio covers some unusual
subject matter here: Nazi experiments, Rose Kennedy and medieval
exorcism. But Creager's lilting vocals and the trio's strong
musical virtuosity elevate the effort to a thing of strange beauty.

   Mystic/Big Beat/Atlantic. 15 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Fat Joe must take pride in the fact that he was behind the first
Latin rap artist to sell a million records, Big Punisher. But, at
the same time, it has to rankle him a bit that he came out before
his protege, Big Punisher. And now, since Pun's a bigger artist in
terms of sales, Fat Joe's third release will be held up against the
guy he helped get into the business. Luckily, Joe seems to be a
smart businessman, incorporating the more charismatic Pun on some
of the best tracks (``My World,'' ``John Blaze''). In fact, only
two of the 15 tracks on the gangland-inspired album don't have a
featured artist. All this makes for a slightly gratuitous effort
with the kind of star and lyrical power that should make Joe second
on the list that Pun tops.

 &HT;    Crow rides `take-it-easy' vibe
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Absolutely nothing momentous intrudes on the glowingly mellow
vibe Sheryl Crow evokes on her latest album, a what-the-hey song
cycle that's at least one toke over the line and so sweetly
redolent of, oh, 1975 that it might as well be trademarked as
flashback pop. Despite all the hoopla about Hole's ``Celebrity
Skin'' being some sort of definitive end-o'-the-century statement
about decadent, soul-gobbling Los Angeles, ``The Globe Sessions''
is more the real deal, truer to Pacific Rim pop sensibilities, at
least in its musical feel.
</P>
<P>
   Crow signifies the seductive undertow of Lotusland in her
blissfully lazy voice, sexy and a little worn by pleasure or peril.
There are the expected tales of romantic misadventure (``Anything
But Down,'' ``My Favorite Mistake''), but also surprises, as when
she channels something like Celtic balladry on ``Riverwide,'' in
which swelling strings, turntable noise and a bit of Led Zeppish
plucking nudge her into new territory.
</P>
<P>
   More so than previously, Crow enjoys infusing her hit-single
savvy girly-pop with odd sonic effects and tape-loop distortions _
thank studio wizard extraordinaire Tchad Blake for bringing the
noise. Yet she doesn't try to reinvent herself. It's hard to
imagine anyone sounding less worked up when she calls out, ``Hey,
let's party, let's get down'' on the loose, funky ``There Goes the
Neighborhood.'' And it's that bearable ``lite''-ness of Crow's
being, along with her endless catalog of sorta-Stonesy riffs, that
distinguish this eminently disposable, eminently enjoyable paean to
lust and leisure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Globe Sessions''
</P>

 &HT;    Sweat stays the course with `Game'
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trying to figure out Keith Sweat's longevity is much more taxing
than listening to his records. And his records can sometimes be
quite trying.
</P>
<P>
   Here's this guy who has managed to survive the New Jack Swing
era of the 1980s, though musically he has yet to surpass the
incredible 1987 record (``Make It Last Forever'') that gave him his
start.
</P>
<P>
   Is it nostalgia? No. Aaron Hall, Al B. Sure and other singers
who arrived during that magical era when hip-hop and R&AMP;B met have
recorded since then and slipped away.
</P>
<P>
   Is it that Sweat's singing has gotten better? No. The reedy
vocalist heard on his first hit single, ``I Want Her,'' is still
very much the nasal vocalist on the current teaming with rapper
Snoop Dogg, the harmless midtempo boast ``Come and Get With Me.''
</P>
<P>
   It has to be consistency. Since Sweat and New Jack founder Teddy
Riley parted ways after the first recording, Sweat can still be
counted on for a love-driven album where he sometimes pleasurably
emotes (``I'm Not Ready''), begs (``Can We Make Love'') and
promises (``Show U What Love Is'') over tracks that never really
push. It's not an impressive plan. But, hey, he's ``Still in the
Game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Still in the Game''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Sweat. Elektra. 12 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Keith Sweat must be ``Still in the Game,'' because
he continues doing more of the same.

 &HT;    FEMA AWAITS WORD FROM FLORIDA FOR AID, HURRICANE GEORGES CLOSES
IN
 &HT;    EDs: Optional add begins at 250 words.
 &HT;    With HURRICANE-GEORGES-0924.
 &HT;    By NICHOLE MONROE 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Florida emergency preparedness teams began
mobilizing Wednesday ahead of Hurricane Georges expected landfall,
the Federal Emergency Management Agency continued to wait Wednesday
before sending in help.
</P>
<P>
   With its 24-hour emergency management office in Atlanta up and
running, aid will only be sent at the request of Florida Gov.
Lawton Chiles, said Mary Hudak, a FEMA spokeswoman. Agency
officials spent Wednesday making conference calls and coordinating
with Florida emergency preparedness officials to identify potential
problem areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're focused on making sure people are taking protective
measures,'' Hudak said. ``At this moment there is not an active
role for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Hudak said if the governor does ask for federal assistance,
anywhere from 12 to 20 personnel could be sent to work with state
officials at a command center in Tallahassee, the state capital.
</P>
<P>
   The staff would include a management team of FEMA employees, and
others from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Department of Health
and Human Services, and Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   In such a case, FEMA may also order the appropriate agencies to
begin shipping necessary supplies and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Chiles declared a state of emergency Wednesday in the center and
south of the state in anticipation of heavy rainfall, high tides,
gale-force winds and flooding.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration allows the state to use the National Guard, lift
tolls along roads designated evacuation routes and purchase
emergency supplies.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add begins.)
</P>
<P>
   Georges threatens to be the worst hurricane to hit south Florida
since 1992's Hurricane Andrew, which caused the most damage of any
storm in U.S. history, with total losses estimated at some $30
billion.
</P>
<P>
   In Andrew's aftermath, FEMA was harshly criticized for
responding sluggishly and waiting until after the hurricane hit to
send aid. But since the arrival of director James Lee Witt in 1993,
the agency has been lauded for becoming more proactive.
</P>
<P>
   ``FEMA is certainly a different agency today than we were in
1992,'' Hudak said. ``We have learned how to plan better,
anticipate better and develop a response system. We have to
remember that Andrew was a very powerful, very devastating storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Georges) hits, it will still be a tough recovery but we
will be there to meet and respond to their needs,'' she said.

 &HT;    GEORGES WHIPS ACROSS EASTERN CUBA, FLORIDA BRACES FOR DISASTER
 &HT;    EDs: Story may need updating after 6 p.m. EDT.
 &HT;    With HURRICANE-PREP-0924; HURRICANE-FEMA-0924.
 &HT;    By SHELLEY EMLING 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Hurricane Georges, the strongest storm to ravage the
Caribbean in years, raged across the poor and ill-prepared island
of Hispaniola before marching relentlessly Wednesday through parts
of Cuba and ominously in the direction of South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane's unofficial death toll from Georges' four-day
rampage across the Caribbean soared to 37, including 17 people in
the Dominican Republic, where the storm spawned looting and street
violence.
</P>
<P>
   A hurricane watch was posted for much of South Florida,
including Monroe, Dade, Broward, and Collier counties, and as many
as 100,000 people in the Florida Keys were instructed to evacuate
for the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want people to panic, but we want them to be
prepared,'' said Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas.
</P>
<P>
   Penelas announced that public schools would be closed on
Thursday and Friday ``no matter what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters predicted that Georges, which packed winds of 75 mph
on Wednesday, could intensify and develop into a Category 2
hurricane by the time it nears Florida. But that would be nothing
compared to Hurricane Andrew, which was nearly a Category 5
hurricane that sustained some wind gusts of up to 175 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Still, South Florida residents took the approaching storm
seriously, scarred by memories of Andrew, packing hardware and
grocery stores before 6 a.m. EDT on Wednesday -- long before
sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew created the most costly natural disaster in U.S. history,
inflicting an estimated $30 billion in damage on South Florida in
1992 -- more than four times the costs run up by Hugo, which killed
85 people and lashed the South Carolina coast in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In the normally laid-back Florida Keys, airline ticket counters
were jam-packed with people trying to flee the area, while rental
cars were no where to be found.
</P>
<P>
   Logjams dotted the two-lane Overseas Highway connecting the
110-mile necklace of islands starting at 7 a.m. EDT, when phased-in
evacuations began in the keys.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, White House spokesman Michael McCurry quoted
Federal Emergency Management director James Lee Witt as saying
Georges could possibly be the worst storm to hit the keys since
1935, when an unnamed hurricane killed 405 people.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m. EDT, Georges was centered over the Windward Passage
some 530 miles southeast of Key West. It was moving west-northwest
at 14 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Georges spent Wednesday dumping heavy rain on the easternmost
provinces of Cuba, where two years of drought has reaped
catastrophic crop and livestock losses.
</P>
<P>
   Civil defense officials evacuated 167,000 people from
flood-prone areas in eastern Cuba, while Cuban President Fidel
Castro appeared on television early Wednesday to urge Cuba's 11
million people to maintain calm and ``revolutionary unity.''
</P>
<P>
   But under sunny skies, residents in the Havana area, which were
not expected to see the brunt of the storm, said they had grown
accustomed to powerful storms, and that they were going about
business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people in Cuba are all that nervous because
we're used to getting storms all the time, and it's just part of
living on an island,'' said Yoselinda Atan, a Havana resident.
</P>
<P>
   Georges took its time trampling the island of Hispaniola
overnight Tuesday and didn't move off-shore until after dawn on
Wednesday, nearly 18 hours after it first made landfall.
</P>
<P>
   The island's 10,000-foot peaks slowed winds from 110 mph on
Tuesday to 75 mph early Wednesday, but the storm was expected to
pick up strength once it moved over the warmer, open waters.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dominican Republic, soldiers enforced a curfew in the
capital of Santo Domingo after Georges ravaged that country.
</P>
<P>
   News reports said that bands of youth with pistols had roamed
the streets while looters waded waist-deep in water, carrying
appliances on their heads even in the midst of powerful winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are occupying Santo Domingo to prevent criminal acts, which
we see practically as acts of terrorism,'' said armed forces chief
Ruben Paulino Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti, the hemisphere's poorest country, was sorely unprepared
for Georges' fury, and had mustered only $130,000 this week to deal
with the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities confirmed 13 deaths in Haiti. Six occurred when a
house collapsed in a neighborhood just outside the capital of
Port-au-Prince.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, many Haitians in the capital did not lose power or
phone service as a result of the storm while many roads were still
drivable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been as much damage as was expected,'' said a
spokesman at the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 90 percent of the roads are still passable, although a
100-foot section of the pier was destroyed, so three commercial
vessels in the harbor were cut loose,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Georges began pummeling a string of Caribbean islands last
weekend, sustaining winds on Sunday as high as 150 mph and leaving
several people dead in its wake from collapsed roofs and mudslides.
Insured losses in the Caribbean are expected to exceed $1 billion,
one of the worst Caribbean hurricane losses ever for the insurance
industry.

 &HT;    So far so good for ``Jesse'': But, will it last?
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Jesse'' begins tonight (8:30 EDT on NBC) as a terrifically
disposable sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   It's Must-Stare TV _ a rat-a-tat mix of sexy stuff to look at
(Christina Applegate for the fellas, Bruno Campos for the gals) and
a quick-footed, ain't-I-stupid jokiness that's a really nice
changeup for those of us battered every night by that mean old
``Jeopardy!'' (10-year-old doing homework at a bar: ``What's the
capital of Uraguay?'' Grandfather who runs the bar: ``Paraguay'').
</P>
<P>
   It's even got a heart. Applegate, the brilliant ditz on
``Married ... with Children,'' is mid-20s single mom Jesse who
waitresses at a German-themed bar in Buffalo run by her dad, an
Archie Bunker-alike played by George Dzundza (``Did you know
William Shatner is Jewish? ... I just never pictured those people
in space''). Jesse's concern is for her kids, who include a
10-year-old son (Eric Lloyd), her widowed (we assume) father and
two adult brothers, one of whom (John Lehr) has decided not to talk
until he ``finds ways to use language in a more efficient manner.''
</P>
<P>
   It has the working-class warmth of ``Grace Under Fire,'' only
with a title character you might actually get to like after a
while. Jesse is mother, sister and all-around show runner while
thinking of heading off to nursing school. Applegate pulls it off
with that knack she has for being fond of men even as she sees
through them right to their shallow core.
</P>
<P>
   Tension _ and it's a fine tension _ arrives in new neighbor
Diego (Campos), a Chilean hunka-hunka who, with gentlemanly aplomb,
asks Jesse out dancing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't date,'' she tells him straight up. ``I'm a single mom,
and on nights I don't work I like to be with my kid. And there's my
family ... I just made this decision I don't have room for
dancing.''
</P>
<P>
   With dancing out, Jesse and Diego do laundry, and we settle in
for a make-me-laugh season of ``will they ever?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, do they ever. By next week's second episode, the show
collapses into an over-the-top sex farce that only NBC could think
works.
</P>
<P>
   For no good reason, one of Jesse's fellow barmaids wonders
loudly why our heroine didn't just cut off Diego's manhood ``and
toss it in a cornfield?''
</P>
<P>
   In a single episode, ``Jesse'' loses its heart and its mind.
Maybe we should've known. It's brought to us by
Bright/Kauffman/Crane Productions, a smart but dicey shop that
previously hit with ``Dream On'' and ``Friends,'' then bombed last
year with ``Veronica's Closet,'' the season's best sitcom pilot
before the show turned to mud.
</P>
<P>
   After tonight's promising opener, ``Jesse'' looks like a sad
repeat of that.

   Movie Plans for TBS
</P>
<P>
   TBS has signed up Antonio Sabato Jr. to star in its first
original TV film. In the tentatively titled ``Reaper,'' Sabato will
play a doctor (that's right, a doctor) trying to stop a killer
computer virus that evolves into a deadly real-life virus. The
film, to be shot this fall in Vancouver, B.C., will be directed by
Armand Mastroianni (``He Knows You're Alone'') from a script by
Rockne O'Bannon (``Alien Nation''). ``Reaper'' is scheduled to air
on TBS early next year.

 &HT;    Smart, sexy `Beauty' takes its romance with shot of spice
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Dangerous Beauty'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   Bad title, good movie. Set in 16th-century Venice and based on
the true story of a famed courtesan named Veronica Franco, the
movie is a brainy bodice-ripper. Veronica (gorgeous Catherine
McCormack) is truly, madly, deeply in love with Marco (gorgeous
Rufus Sewell), the handsome scion of an aristocratic family.
Unfortunately, she has neither money nor bloodlines, and Marco's
parents expect him to marry according to his station. So Veronica
takes up the world's oldest profession. And thanks to her beauty
and wit (she was a poet, as well), she's soon the toast of Venice.
But there are obstacles: the plague, the Inquisition, the
disapproving wives of her admirers, the kinky sexual preferences of
the king of France, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Feminism and whoring aren't as, um, strange bedfellows as you
might think. True, director Marshall Herskovitz lets things get a
little florid and close to camp. But the real lures here are the
very good actors, the sumptuous costumes and production design, and
the same sort of old-fashioned romantic panache that made
``Titanic'' a mega-hit. You might say ``Dangerous Beauty'' is the
real Spice Girls movie. Only with its frank sexuality and nudity,
it's definitely for adults only. Grade: A-

 &HT;    COLUMN: Revisit classics to discover genius of Orson Welles
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rise, fall and mythologizing of Orson Welles remains one of
Hollywood's quintessential stories. But a new generation may wonder
what all the fuss is about. They can see for themselves on the big
screen with the current re-release of 1958's ``Touch of Evil,''
starring a post-Moses Charlton Heston and a pre-shower Janet Leigh.
(Funny how water figures in both careers.)
</P>
<P>
   But should you want more than just a touch of Welles, here are
some home-video suggestions to give you an idea of why he mattered
so much. And still does.
</P>
<P>
   ``CITIZEN KANE'' (1941)
</P>
<P>
   The one. The only. The biggie. The No. 1 film on just about any
list you'd care to name. Welles hit Hollywood running with this
four-pronged debut _ as director, producer, co-writer and star of
the movie that changed the way we look at movies. A veritable
encyclopedia of innovative film techniques _ Gregg Toland's famed
deep-focus photography, Robert Wise's jump-cuts, the eccentric
camera angles _ the movie is a timeless mystery wrapped inside a
tabloid enigma. When Charles Foster Kane (Welles), newspaper
magnate, power broker and celebrated recluse, dies, a reporter
embarks on a ``Rashomon''-like search in which he interviews those
who were closest _ or as close as you could get _ to Kane. His one
clue is Kane's deathbed utterance, which is, perhaps, the most
famous word in the history of talkies: ``Rosebud.''
</P>
<P>
   ``THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS'' (1942)
</P>
<P>
   Welles' magnificent follow-up to ``Kane'' set the pattern for
his less than magnificent relationship with Hollywood. He wrote and
directed this adaptation of Booth Tarkington's Pulitzer
Prize-winning novel about a prosperous Midwestern family whose
genteel way of life is shattered by the new industrial age,
symbolized by the invention of the automobile. ``Kane's'' Joseph
Cotten and Agnes Moorehead have major roles. But, his narration
aside, Welles is absent from the screen. He was absent from the
editing room, too, thus laying the groundwork for his later
difficulties as a ``difficult'' artist. Where was he? On one of his
typically quixotic jaunts, this time to South America. With Welles
out of reach, the studio exercised its right to final cut, and a
hacked-up ``Ambersons'' became one of the most famous flawed
masterpieces in movie history.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI'' (1948)
</P>
<P>
   Supposedly, when Columbia mogul Harry Cohn saw a rough cut of
this picture, he yelled, ``I'll give $1,000 to anyone who can
explain the story to me.'' But plot isn't this movie's strong
point. It's not even something in which Welles, as writer, director
and star, was especially interested. But, for the record, it's a
tongue-in-cheek thriller about a tough, uncomplicated sailor
(Welles) who becomes a pawn in a deadly game between a rich lawyer
(Everett Sloane) and his beautiful wife (Rita Hayworth, recently
divorced from Welles). What people mostly remember about the film
are two things. One, that Welles cut his ex's famous long red locks
and dyed her hair blond, like her then-rival Lana Turner. Two, the
funhouse finale in which Hayworth's face is reflected endlessly in
a hall of mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   ``CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT'' (1967)
</P>
<P>
   Welles made three Shakespearean films _ the others are
``Othello'' and ``Macbeth'' _ so at least one ought to be included.
Why this one? Because it so eerily presages the Falstaffian parody
of himself that Welles would become in his later years (``We sell
no wine before its time''). Shot in fragments in different parts of
Spain, the movie plays like an elegy. Falstaff, consort of princes,
connoisseur of fine food and flagons of drink, becomes, as he does
in Shakespeare's plays, irrelevant. Not forgotten _ that was
impossible _ but no longer the confidant of Prince Hal (soon to be
King Henry V). It's what happened to Welles; he became the movies'
most famous ghost. As for the movie itself, one critic called it
``often wondrous and nearly always chaotic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``THE THIRD MAN'' (1949)
</P>
<P>
   Carol Reed directed, not Welles, but even so, this celebrated
baroque noir is a must-see Welles movie. His is the small but
crucial role of the elusive Harry Lime, black marketeer
extraordinaire in postwar Vienna. The lead is played by Welles' old
pal and co-worker Joseph Cotten, cast as an American writer chasing
Lime's shadow through the treacherous Viennese underworld.
Apparently Welles did some rewrites, but mostly he was content just
to act; he was beginning work on ``Othello,'' one of his usual
ongoing works-in-progress. Welles later claimed that ``The Third
Man'' was the only movie of his that he ever watched on television
``because I like it so much.'' A final irony: He almost wasn't in
it. David O. Selznick, who owned the American rights, wanted Reed
to use Noel Coward instead.

 &HT;    MINI VIEWS: The latest on video
 &HT;    By Steve Murray and Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   -- ``Happy Together'' (Unrated) _ Happy together is what Tony
Leung and Leslie Cheung never seem to be, playing lovers from Hong
Kong who've moved to Buenos Aires. Written and directed by Wong
Kar-Wai, who won the best director prize at Cannes for his work
here, the movie follows the men through the seamier alleys of
Argentina. And shows them both behaving badly in their
disintegrating relationship. Wong brings a documentary-like
scrutiny to this folie a deux. But the abrasive realism is
ameliorated by style borrowed from the French new wave, jumping
from saturated color scenes to grainy black and white and shuffling
up the time frame. It captures the messy open-endedness of life.
But be forewarned: It's one of those art films that can test your
patience. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Mercury Rising'' (R) _ A gray, tired and joyless Bruce
Willis vehicle that makes ``The Jackal'' look like a classic. This
one casts Willis as Art, an undercover FBI agent who has to protect
a 9-year-old named Simon (Miko Hughes) from killers. Simon is an
autistic boy who accidentally cracks a security code devised by the
shadowy, all-powerful National Security Agency. Alec Baldwin, in
his too-familiar sinister mode, plays an NSA honcho who orders the
kid rubbed out. Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   -- ``My Giant'' (PG) _ A mildly likable family film made less
child-appropriate because of an oral-sex throwaway and too many
insider show-biz jokes. Billy Crystal plays a third-rate talent
agent who thinks he's found his ticket to the big time (literally)
when he discovers a bona fide giant (basketball center Gheorghe
Muresan).
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Nightwatch'' (R) _ This dank, depressing creepfest stars
Ewan McGregor as a student working in a morgue who finds himself
framed by a serial killer. Josh Brolin plays his suspiciously
impetuous best friend, and Nick Nolte (who's made up to look like a
member of the walking dead) plays a morbid police inspector. The
movie is undone by huge plot holes and its own gruesome tone.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Players Club'' (R) _ Rapper Ice Cube, making his debut
as a writer and director, offers a flick that masquerades as the
story of a single mother (Lisa Raye) who nobly struggles to pay her
college tuition and feed her young son by dancing at a strip club.
Cube is a technically accomplished director. But the movie pretends
to be feminist while giving us cliched views of women, two rapes
and a cat fight between the mother and another dancer. It's
prurient ``ho''-some entertainment. Don't get played by it.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Updike has moved beyond the Nobel, work by work
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL SEPTEMBER 27: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    BY Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   His most enduring creation, the one-time high school basketball
star Rabbit Angstrom, has long since padded off into retirement,
not quite sure where his life went or what it amounted to. The
adulterous, middle-age couples who have peopled many of his short
stories, wayfarers in search of something they cannot name, seem
truer to life than we had thought. He has tucked them in bed _
where they spent a lot of time anyway _ and moved on, book by book
by book.
</P>
<P>
   How many years has it been, and how many books ago? John Updike,
66 now. No longer boyish looking, as the newsweeklies invariably
reported when he turned 40 and then 50 (``Going Great at 50,''
Time's cover said in 1982), but the trim frame, gray thatch of hair
and aquiline nose jog the memory and you recall when this was the
coming young man in American fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Here was a writer whose talent promised more than anyone should
be expected to deliver. Since the publication of ``The Poorhouse
Fair,'' his first novel, in 1959 and ``Rabbit, Run'' a year later,
John Updike has been looked to for the ``big'' novel certifying
that he had arrived at last. Instead he has written no fewer than
49 books _ 18 novels, a memoir, volumes of poetry and short
stories, children's books, a play and collections of criticism
unsurpassed since the days of Edmund Wilson. Whatever big novel
Updike was supposed to write _ ``The Brothers Karamazov'' with sex
scenes? _ no one asks any longer when his promise will be
fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   He has won every prize but the Nobel, a subject of annual
conjecture and one playfully at the center of ``Bech at Bay: A
Quasi-Novel'' (Knopf, $23), the third appearance by Updike's
presumed alter ego. You could not call them doubles. Henry Bech is
Jewish and, in an earlier book, suffered a 13-year writer's block.
Updike takes his bearings from the likes of Karl Barth and Soren
Kierkegaard, and produces a book a year. But Bech is a useful
instrument nonetheless, a fictional creation through whom Updike
settles scores with critics while pondering the literary life in a
celebrity culture.
</P>
<P>
   A winner with fancy penmanship
</P>
<P>
   For Henry Bech, obscurity at least had its consolations. ``A
storm of protest,'' Updike writes in a delicious pastiche,
``greeted the announcement that Henry Bech had won the 1999 Nobel
Prize for Literature. Fumed a New York Times editorial: `The
Swedish Academy's penchant for colorful nonentities and
anti-establishment gadflies as recipients of its dynamite-based
bounty has surpassed mere caprice and taken on, in this latest
selection, dimensions of wantonness. If the time for an American
winner had at last come round again, then a deliberate affront must
be read in this bypassing of solid contenders like Mailer, Roth,
and Ozick, not to mention Pynchon and DeLillo, in favor of this
passe exponent of fancy penmanship. ...'''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the Pulitzer Prize-winning ``Rabbit at Rest'' was
published in 1990, Updike answered critics who found in his novels
no ideas, only fancy penmanship (and much sex). ``My original
concept,'' he wrote, ``had been to write two novellas to be bound
in one volume, which would contrast two approaches to the game of
life: one would be the rabbit approach, a kind of dodgy approach _
spontaneous, unreflective, frightened, hence my character's name,
Angstrom _ and the second was to be the horse method of coping with
life, to get into harness and pull your load until you drop. And
this was eventually `The Centaur.' But I began the rabbit book
first.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of unworthiness
</P>
<P>
   Each book would take on a life of its own, each a new beginning.
``And that,'' he wryly wrote, ``is the way we accumulate a shelf of
books; every idea subdivides and becomes two and then four, and in
that manner you can have written 37 books (now 49) without having
had very many ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Bech at Bay,'' Updike's undeserving hero addresses the
members of the Swedish Academy in words dipped in satiric acid.
``The Nobel Prize,'' he says, ``has become so big, such a celebrity
among prizes, that no one is worthy to win it, and the embarrassed
winner can shelter his unworthiness behind the unworthiness of
everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   At 66, Updike almost stands above the prize that has eluded him,
his pre-eminence taken for granted. I got a glimpse of this six
years ago under a large tent in Central Park. It was a literary
gathering associated with a famous prize, and although the little
fish outnumbered the big ones, there were enough of the latter that
one could have spent the afternoon counting kibitzing celebrities.
Mailer here, Roth there. ...
</P>
<P>
   Off to a side, standing by himself and eating a hot dog, was the
tall figure and the profile seen in so many Jill Krementz dust
jacket photographs. Almost bashfully, a woman introduced herself.
She was Annie Dillard, one of the finest stylists of our day. I
remember the look in her eyes. It was undisguised adoration. In a
moment, he finished his hot dog, slipped beneath the folds of the
tent and sauntered off through Central Park under a blue September
sky. In the company of big names and bigger egos, John Updike stood
alone.

 &HT;    Grammer gets his shot at king of Thursdays
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kelsey's home.
</P>
<P>
   That's Kelsey as in Grammer, and home as the most important
patch of real estate on TV, 9 p.m. EDT Thursdays on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frasier,'' which just won an unprecedented fifth straight Emmy
Award as best comedy for its mix of broad farce and sharp
drawing-room wit, has its sixth season premiere tonight, moving
into the slot vacated by ``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   But long before Jerry and his jerky friends lived there, it was
home to ``Cheers,'' the long-running sitcom that introduced Dr.
Frasier Winslow Crane on Sept. 27, 1984, as Diane Chambers'
psychiatrist, then lover, then devoted fool.
</P>
<P>
   He's been lovably foolish ever since.
</P>
<P>
   One of the least likely cast members from ``Cheers'' to be spun
off into his show, Frasier Crane has flourished as a comedic
character. He keeps hitting rock bottom, then keeps digging.
</P>
<P>
   Love life? He occasionally shoots and scores, but the writers
know he's much funnier when frustrated and humiliated.
</P>
<P>
   Professional life? At the end of last season, he was fired from
his dial-a-shrink job at rinky-dink Seattle radio station KACL-AM,
along with the rest of the staff. He won't get back behind the mike
for awhile, as his resulting crisis of confidence will play out
over several episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Family life? As maddening as ever. Brother Niles (David Hyde
Pierce) will continue his protracted divorce from his never-seen,
ultra-neurotic estranged wife, Maris. (``What do you expect from a
woman who thinks a chocolate allergy entitles her to use a
handicapped space?'' Niles once fumed.) Maris' lawyers will start
bleeding away Niles' money this season.
</P>
<P>
   And of course there are housekeeper Daphne (Jane Leeves), who
will finally get a romance of her own this season with a
rough-edged lawyer, whom the brothers Crane will naturally loathe;
Roz (Peri Gilpin), Frasier's producer, now a single mom who's
cleaning up her tramp act; and dad Martin Crane (John Mahoney), the

   It's an unbeatable ensemble, but there's only one name in the
title. Grammer has stayed out of the tabloids of late after a
string of drug charges, rehab, relapses and rather flamboyant young
women. On-screen, he's never been less than clearheaded, a devotee
of the late Jack Benny who has brought Benny's slow burns and
ticked-off mannerisms to a new audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frasier'' has always been popular, but it's never quite been a
pop-culture monolith like ``Cheers'' or ``Seinfeld.'' Its chance
starts tonight.

MAKING BOOKS: POLITICS AS USUAL _ NO WEIRD SEX 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Will it be possible for the virtuosos who write political novels
to top the gaminess and authenticity of the Starr report? Or create
as juicy and mingy characters, and become rich in the doing? After
all we've seen and heard, could a novelist conjure a pair at least
as outrageous as President Clinton and Kenneth Starr, even if they
are sort of the duke and the dauphin of American politics?
</P>
<P>
   Joe Klein, who came close in his ``Primary Colors'' (Random
House), may have been the last to try for a while, having published
under the wire before the preposterous became thinkable.
</P>
<P>
   The political novel is not dead, he said. It can be successful
still with what he laughingly calls ``egregious modesty and
subtlety.'' That is, he says, if the novel is ``not as blatant and
tawdry and obvious as the events in Washington are now, with people
pretty disgusted with what the president and the prosecutor have
done.''
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, Klein is trying, now writing another novel, his
first under a new two-book contract. And it's about politics.
``There's an awful lot of political stuff to write; an election
contest can be made exciting and fun, or the inside guts of
creating legislation; or a politician finding true love,'' he said,
adding, ``What's in retirement for a while is a political novel
exposing weird sexual action.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Greenfield, the CNN political analyst, put it this way:
``Readers are now accustomed to a reality so bizarre that
bizarreness isn't going to win any prizes for creativity. Weird
presidential behavior is pretty much for nonfiction now.''
Greenfield published a political novel, ``The People's Choice''
(Putnam), in 1995, and is working on a second one about the sins of
big media.
</P>
<P>
   So it would seem that what is erupting in Washington now means
that some of our fiction has to be deflated, made narrower in
focus, to work in the marketplace. Even before all this, any writer
whose name wasn't Dostoyevsky but who had the imagination and wild
daring to approach what is actually happening would have been told
by prospective publishers to ``get ahold of yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   And now? Well, Dan Menaker, who edited ``Primary Colors,'' said
that although he doesn't believe events will ``obviate the
political novel,'' it ``will have to be redefined for now. We may
have to try to drive in the opposite direction, a smaller canvas,
some incident. Who knows if there's a congressperson in Des Moines
who will offer creative artists a chance to make a comment?''
</P>
<P>
   As a genre, the political novel is more than 100 years old in
the United States, long predating the latest manifestations of the
freakishness politics has revealed. What is generally considered to
be the first great Washington political insider novel was
``Democracy,'' a vinegary satire that was published anonymously in
1880, making its author, Henry Adams, the first Anonymous in the
line of two.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Penn Warren's ``All the King's Men,'' the 1949 Pulitzer
Prize-winning story of the rise of a political demagogue resembling
Huey Long, announced to novelists that politics could be a vibrant
subject for dissection. But the first modern Washington-based
political novel was Allen Drury's ``Advise and Consent'' in 1959, a
serious and almost scary tale of a Senate confirmation battle over
the nominee for secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   The true successor to Warren and Drury is Ward Just, whose
critically acclaimed novel ``Echo House,'' published last year by
Houghton Mifflin, tracked the evolution of government morality
through three generations of a powerful political family.
</P>
<P>
   As far as Just is concerned, current events have reduced
politics ``to a story for the movies or for soap operas. I doubt
very much I'd ever write another political novel.'' He believes the
public's appetite has been ``satiated for a long time'' by the real
stuff, and in this febrile atmosphere ``only a great satirist could
use this load of material, or maybe a Dreiser.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At any rate, his next novel is about agony of a different sort,
Vietnam in 1965, and it's not about soldiers but about the
Vietnamese and French and American civilians who are there.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Crichton, the publisher at Little, Brown, has a somewhat
different take. ``A certain degree of taking a look back in
politics, a certain degree of distance from now'' will probably be
needed for a political novel to work, she said. Probably true, but
also wishful, since next summer she is publishing a novel by
William F. Buckley Jr. about the rise and fall of Sen. Joseph
McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   There is one recent novel that does in fact approach the
outlandishness of the current reality, though it is a close but
different genre, the political thriller. The book is Charles
McCarry's ``Lucky Bastard'' (Random House), published this summer,
with the premise that John F. Kennedy sired a son out of wedlock
who had a fervently intense libido that made him an ideal
presidential candidate to be subverted by the KGB.
</P>
<P>
   Despite naysaying about trying to compete with reality, there
remains another side to the question of the viability of political
novels in the immediate future. Many publishers, like many movie
makers, cash in on what they perceive to be the heat of the moment
and cannot resist the siren call of blaring headlines, so agents
will be popping clients' proposals about politics.
</P>
<P>
   And with the Starr report's vulgar details of the exchange of
gimcrack gifts between a president and his female diversion, of
sexual acts not even completed to climax, why shouldn't a cunning
novelist try to compete against the nonfiction that for now seems
to be more than satisfying our need for drama? After all that we've
read and watched, what is now so far-fetched about creating a
gigantesque fictional character who smokes dope but doesn't inhale?

STARR DOCUMENTS SUGGEST THAT VERNON JORDAN KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Documents turned over by independent counsel
Kenneth Starr portray presidential confidant Vernon Jordan as a
top-flight fixer and go-between who knew more about President
Clinton's sex affair with Monica Lewinsky than he was letting on.
</P>
<P>
   When published reports of Clinton's affair with Lewinsky first
appeared last January, Jordan was under Starr's scrutiny for
allegedly encouraging Lewinsky to lie under oath and for helping
her find a job to win her silence.
</P>
<P>
   In subsequent public statements, Jordan denied pressuring
Lewinsky to lie and described his assistance in her job search as
just ``giving a helping hand,'' no strings attached.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Jordan said Lewinsky told him there was no sexual
relationship between Clinton and her. But Lewinsky's grand jury
testimony and Starr's Sept. 11 report contradict Jordan on that
point, suggesting that he in fact knew what was going on between
Clinton and Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In their first meeting on Dec. 11, Lewinsky told Jordan she saw
Clinton not as president but ``more as a man'' with whom she got
angry because ``he doesn't call me enough or see me enough.''
Jordan demurred that perhaps Clinton had other things on his mind
and eventually told Lewinsky: ``You're in love, that's what your
problem is.''
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 19, 1997, the day Lewinsky received a subpoena to
testify in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit, Jordan asked
Lewinsky whether she ever had a sexual relationship with the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky said no, but later told the grand jury that she assumed
Jordan knew all about it and was just probing to find out how she
would answer such a question under oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was under the impression that Mr. Jordan kind of knew with a
wink and a nod,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said he was seeing Clinton that evening and Lewinsky
asked him to give the president ``a hug for me.'' Jordan replied,
``I don't hug men.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan arranged a subsequent meeting for Lewinsky with another
lawyer, Francis Carter, to help her respond to the subpoena in the
Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 22, 1997 _ a month before the first published reports of
the Clinton-Lewinsky affair _ Lewinsky said she told Jordan that
she and Clinton had engaged in phone sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what's phone sex?'' Jordan responded, according to
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you know what phone sex is,'' Lewinsky replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't,'' Jordan said, according to Lewinsky. ``I'm just
an old man. I don't know what phone sex is.''
</P>
<P>
   At a breakfast meeting on Dec. 31, Lewinsky said she asked
Jordan if he thought Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
would always be together. Jordan answered ``Yes,'' but offered the
apparently light-hearted suggestion that maybe some day Lewinsky
and Clinton would have an affair some day.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky said she then told Jordan that she and Clinton were
already having an affair.
</P>
<P>
   While ``we didn't have sex,'' they ``did everything but sex,''
she said she told him.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan ``didn't really respond to me,'' Lewinsky said. ``So I
took that as a cue to drop the subject.''
</P>
<P>
   When Lewinsky mentioned that she had drafts of letters to
Clinton lying around her apartment, Jordan urged her to ``go home
and make sure they're not there.'' Later, Lewinsky discarded about
50 of the notes, she testified.
</P>
<P>
   In Jordan's first public statement on Jan. 22, he said that
``Ms. Lewinsky told me in no uncertain terms that she did not have
a sexual relationship with the president.'' He did not explain why
such a topic of conversation would even come up between Lewinsky
and himself.
</P>
<P>
   In his grand jury testimony in March, Jordan said he asked
Clinton whether there had been such a relationship and that the
president responded, ``No, never.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, 63, is a former civil rights leader who has soared to
the height of the legal profession in Washington through close
connections to the powerful, including Clinton. He chaired
Clinton's original transition team in 1993, and has been a golfing
buddy and confidant ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky told the grand jury that enlisting Jordan to help her
find a job in New York was either her idea or Linda Tripp's. Tripp,
a friend and confidant of Lewinsky when both worked at the
Pentagon, secretly recorded Lewinsky's ruminations about her affair
with Clinton and turned the tapes over to Starr.
</P>
<P>
   In a conversation with Clinton in October 1997, Clinton said he
thought getting Jordan involved was ``a good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan did not return a phone call to his office seeking comment
Wednesday. Jordan's grand jury testimony has not been released, but
snippets of it appear in the Starr report. Jordan, for instance,
described Lewinsky as a ``highly emotional lady'' who seemed
``fixated'' on Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, Lewinsky's testimony aids Jordan in his claims
of innocence in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it was part of Tripp's initial claim to Starr that
Jordan was seeking a job for Lewinsky to buy her silence. Tripp
based this claim on one of her secret tape recordings of Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   On the tape, Lewinsky said she told Jordan she would not sign an
affidavit in the Jones case denying a sexual relationship with
Clinton until a job was found for her.
</P>
<P>
   In her grand jury testimony, Lewinsky said she had lied to Tripp
about the conversation with Jordan. Tripp had insisted she sign
nothing until after Jordan found her a job, Lewinsky said. She
added that she feared alienating Tripp, someone with whom she had
shared intimate details of her relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of those things I said got (Jordan) into a lot
trouble,'' Lewinsky told the grand jury. ``He's a good person.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Starr's perjury accusations against Clinton is based on
the independent counsel's decision to believe Jordan's version of
events when they contradicted the president's.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan insisted that he kept the president fully informed of his
efforts to find Lewinsky a job as well as a lawyer after Lewinsky
received a subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, in his January deposition with the Jones lawyers,
said that while he remembered Jordan's employment-related
assistance to Lewinsky, he didn't recall Jordan keeping him abreast
of Lewinsky's growing involvement in the Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In his Aug. 17 grand jury testimony, however, Clinton said he
had no reason to doubt that such conversations with Jordan took
place.
</P>
<P>
   The Starr report concluded that Jordan's testimony was reliable,
referring to him as ``one of the country's leading attorneys.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr went on to accuse Clinton of making deliberate
misstatements under oath in the Jones deposition to ``avoid inquiry
into whether Ms. Lewinsky's job and her testimony were improperly
related.''

 By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jack Lenor Larsen was ready for his close-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nun's veiling,'' he said of the sheer, black, collarless
suit he was wearing that summer day, ``designed by my friend
Massimo Vignelli. It's cooler than cotton.''
</P>
<P>
   Larsen is a man of the cloth, but it's not like that. He is
possibly the most accomplished textile designer living, certainly
one of the most innovative and influential of the second half of
the 20th century. With the success of several thousand fabric
patterns behind him _ many as original as modern architecture _ he
has been prolific and powerful in the design community. And through
the collections that his travels inspired, the middle-class home
and office became conversant with vibrant traditions everywhere _
from Thailand to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   The handsome Larsen's life has also been a fabric of sorts, of
acquaintance with the rich and celebrated, of social prowess and
business sense that have brought him fame and fortune, travels that
have wrapped the world and homes that led the fashionable world to
his door.
</P>
<P>
   Now, this month, at 71, he has published an autobiography,
``Jack Lenor Larsen _ A Weaver's Memoir'' (Harry Abrams, Inc.).
Friends _ he has known everyone, from Marilyn Monroe to Frank Lloyd
Wright _ have undoubtedly heard these stories at the table at
Longhouse Reserve, his 12,000-square-foot home on Long Island,
which is also an arts foundation and a 16-acre garden open to the
public. Larsen spins a good tale.
</P>
<P>
   Larsen doffs a hat _ a black straw Amish number _ and points
inside to the label.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're called `Park Avenue,' but they come from Muncie,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Lenor Larsen lives in East Hampton and on Park Avenue, but
as he would have you remember, he is a weaver from Seattle. He was
born in 1927, to Danish-Norwegian immigrants from Canada. The
simplicity of Larsen's Northwest background can still be felt in
his presence _ the warp to the weft of his sophistication, deeply
rooted in the Douglas firs and Olympic and Cascade Mountains and
glacial, salmon bays of Puget Sound. His father was a building
contractor. Intrigued with design, Larsen studied architecture, at
the University of Washington. In 1945, there was great interest in
the Northwest in crafts. In his junior year, the young designer
took a weaving course that put his future in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``After two years of architecture, drafting things that would
never be built, weaving felt good indeed,'' he recalled. ``It had
horizontals and verticals, like architecture, and was dependent on
materials and light and shadows, but I had real yarns and real
color and real structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Larsen also made the first of a life's work of influential
friends, Chan Khan, born in Lima, the son of the Chinese ambassador
and the last direct descendant of Kubla Khan. Khan was exporting
pre-Columbian textiles. Amazed by the beauty of their systems,
Larsen decided to become a weaver.
</P>
<P>
   Liberated by his decision, he moved to Los Angeles as part of a
company of unattached, young friends involved in art, design, music
and dance. They roved the coast; Larsen wove cloth from pine cones
and seed pods scavenged on beaches.
</P>
<P>
   He met Dorothea Hulse, who owned Handcraft House, a custom weave
shop and a school to the stars. Home crafts like weaving were
voguish in Hollywood in the 1950s; she gave him work teaching
weaving. One of Larsen's students was Joan Crawford, not the first
person one associates with home economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was weaving plaid suits for her children,'' he said. ``She
had burned out on another marriage and she decided, well, she still
had children,'' he recalled with a sharp grin. ``We took her at her
word,'' he said of Ms. Crawford's role as good mother. ``It wasn't
the first part she had studied,'' but, he said, ``It was such a
mask. She wore tremendous amounts of makeup and her personality was
as covered up.''
</P>
<P>
   Larsen had a brief stint back in Seattle. He hung out his sign,
``Jack Larsen _ Weaver,'' on his studio door. A woman brought him
pants to mend. A professor from the Cranbrook Academy of Art in
Bloomfield Hills, Mich., offered him work as a teaching assistant.
Larsen stayed on as a graduate student, on scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``For designers, Cranbrook was a kind of Hollywood,'' he said.
``We were 65 students in the academy, and there were 65 gardeners.
They had just stopped shining the students' shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   He made himself known to Eleanor Lloyd Richards, who had taught
there. ``She was from a Dutch family that owned the upper East
Side,'' Larsen said. In 1952, when Larsen arrived in New York, Mrs.
Richards wrote him a check to help him bring his loom and 40 boxes
of belongings with him.
</P>
<P>
   With his background in architecture and his enthusiasm for new
technologies, the young weaver was gaining a reputation as a
modernist _ innovating in a field that was barely there:
contemporary commercial fabric design. Modern architectural and
interior design found themselves with an American audience in the
1940s and '50s, but there were few fabrics to fit the clean
furniture or drape the glass picture windows. Larsen would create a
strong market for them.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to submit a design for a curtain for Lever House _ New
York's first International Style office building. Larsen's entry,
which was chosen, was a drapery of translucent lace woven with
linen cord and gold metal, an exotic match of materials for which
he would become well known.
</P>
<P>
   By 1953, Jack Lenor Larsen was incorporated. ``I had a Beverly
Hills debutante as my weaving assistant,'' he said. Neither had
ever worked before. They hand-wove ``shaggy'' craft neckties which
found themselves noosed on New York's best-known necks, ``the
people I most admired,'' said Larsen, ``like Sandy Calder and I.M.
Pei and Leonard Bernstein.'' Florence Knoll, the modern design
doyenne, who had turned down his portfolio in 1951 for being ``too
individualistic,'' commissioned furniture fabrics in a palette of
olives and Spanish oranges that became the ``avocado'' and
``harvest gold'' of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   By 1954, he had a showroom on Park Avenue at 58th Street.
Marilyn Monroe walked in with her decorator, shopping for the house
in Connecticut she was setting up with Arthur Miller. Frank Lloyd
Wright walked in, and walked out with 200 yards of a shimmering
blue-green fabric for the music room at Taliesen. Wright was
technically a rival. F. Schumacher and Co. had recently introduced
two lines of his fabric design. It was commonly understood in the
design community, Larsen recalled, that they hadn't been designed
by Wright but by stylists commissioned to produce Wrightian
product. ``He needed the money. He was such a spendthrift, that
he'd never paid his taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   As a weaver Larsen had established a branch of architecture, the
design of fabrics based as much on adventurous structure _
pre-Colombian or postwar American _ as esthetics. ``I like ancient
techniques and the cutting edge,'' he said. ``The extremes are
always more interesting than the middle.'' On his loom, Larsen
shuttled between the two.
</P>
<P>
   By 1958, he had designed his first upholstery fabrics for
airplanes _ Pan American's new 707 fleet. And he showed the
American public the world, long before they became global
consumers, through ikats and batiks that were familiar only to the
privileged. By 1974, Jack Lenor Larsen Inc. was producing fabrics
in 30 countries.

CLINTON SCANDAL RAISES QUESTION: WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO AMERICANS? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For Release Sunday, Sept. 27)   (For Use By New York Times News Service)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Out of the furor over sex, sin and semantics that
has debased the White House and besmirched Bill Clinton's
presidency, an unprecedented dichotomy of opinion has emerged,
built around a single basic question: What is important to
Americans?
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for us to be polarized into opposing camps
over crucial issues such as the war in Vietnam, the role of the
federal government in our lives or the separation of church and
state. But it is unprecedented for us to be in conflict with each
other over how a president should be punished for indulging in
lurid sexual escapades with a White House intern and misleading the
public about the affair.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls demonstrate that millions of Americans are
weary and angry over the concentrated focus of the news media and
politicians on Clinton's indiscretions. They want the probe ended
so that he can finish the presidential tenure to which he was
elected and turn his full attention to vital matters at home and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Those same polls show that millions of other Americans are
deeply offended by Clinton's personal conduct and his technical
explanation of what transpired between him and Monica Lewinsky.
They want him to be gone from the White House, either through
resignation or impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   To Clinton's supporters, the fact that he is a man of great
charm and intelligence has considerable impact. But it may be less
significant than the old bread-and-butter issue that has helped
politicians win elections and remain in office since the republic
was young.
</P>
<P>
   What we are seeing is a classic example of the late Speaker
Thomas ``Tip'' O'Neill's contention that all politics is local.
</P>
<P>
   When times are good and jobs are plentiful and the nation is at
peace and the people are relatively happy, a president fares well.
Measured by that standard, Clinton's performance as president, as
differentiated from his performance as an aging Don Juan, is
approved by a healthy majority of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   When times are bad and the economy is a shambles and America is
perceived by its foreign adversaries to be weak, a president is in
trouble. That was true with Jimmy Carter in 1980 when Iranian
militants held 52 American hostages, gasoline shortages produced
long lines at pumps across the nation and both inflation and
interest rates were in the double-digit category.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, as he demonstrated in his taped August 17 testimony
before Ken Starr's grand jury, is one of the most elusive
politicians and shrewdest manipulator of words in the history of
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Before the tape was televised, some predicted that the American
people would see a new and unattractive Bill Clinton. He would be
bombastic in his anger and insulting in his reply to questions
posed by Starr's investigators and members of the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Based largely on those advance warnings, polls registered a
decline in Clinton's popularity.
</P>
<P>
   But when Americans actually watched Clinton's performance, they
found him courteous and controlled. A majority appear not to have
been turned off by his ability to give new definitions to old words
such as ``is'' and ``alone'' or his narrow interpretation of
``sexual relations.''
</P>
<P>
   What is important to Americans?
</P>
<P>
   Are the news media and the president's political foes so
obsessed with scandal that they are blinded to the need for him to
concentrate on pressing domestic and international problems? Are
critics of the news media and politicians so disenchanted that they
fail to comprehend the gravity of this great nation being led
during dangerous times by a president who is viewed as a perjurer
who may have obstructed justice?
</P>
<P>
   That is the crux of the division among Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Problems abound in the world. The financial structures of
Russia, Japan and many nations in the Far East and Latin America
are teetering on the brink of collapse. We may be reaching the
point where the United States must exert strong international
leadership to help those nations find their way back to financial
stability, just as we helped rehabilitate shattered Europe with the
Marshall Plan after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence indicates that Iraq, North Korea and other Third World
nations are secretly developing weapons of mass destruction which
could propel all of us into war and devastation.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorism is a growing threat to stability of rich and poor
countries alike and it is time, as Clinton told the United Nations
last week, that all nations unite to oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   At home, farmers are suffering the disastrous affects of drought
and violent weather and are in need of help. America in the 1990s
bears little resemblance to the America of the 1920s. But we never
can forget that the Great Depression began on the farm.
</P>
<P>
   No action has yet been taken to provide for the long-range
protection of Social Security and Medicare, to reform laws
governing the raising of campaign funds or to curtail tobacco use
by young people.
</P>
<P>
   One of the major issues facing the president and Congress is
whether taxes should be reduced and, if so, by how much?
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans believe those matters take precedence over months
of public focus on a president's private sins and public lies. Many
others believe the republic cannot afford to be led by a president
who indulges in such indiscretions and outright dishonesty.
</P>
<P>
   The division strikes at the very heart of who we are and what we
are. The founding fathers, meeting in Philadelphia in 1787, faced
the task of drafting a Constitution that would guide the republic
safely through a turbulent and unchartered future.
</P>
<P>
   That Constitution established the office of the presidency but
did not specify the characteristics and talents he should possess.
Today's Americans must decide what we demand of a president and
then relay that decision to Congress, which ultimately will
determine Bill Clinton's fate.

 NEW YORK: in 30 countries.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unlike world leaders, weavers understood each other _ by
watching. Cloth was like an early map.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Larsen's great love is home, which is largely Longhouse
Reserve, completed in 1992 in collaboration _ their 30th _ with
Charles Forberg, an architect. It is an imposing house on stilts,
suggested by the Shinto shrine in Ise, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   His collections of ancient and contemporary crafts, including
textiles, ceramics and furniture, have followed him there, and
continue to grow, as does the garden with its own art collection.
There is also an arboretum _ Larsen collects trees. Last year, he
sold Larsen Inc. to Cowtan and Tout, a fabric and wallcoverings
company, but he remains a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I finished the house, I wanted to put an epitaph on it,''
he said. ```To The Manor Died' _ I wasn't to the manor born.''
Larsen, leading a brisk tour through the garden _ the briskest
takes about 45 minutes _ was debating the offer of a gift of
Italian cypresses made to the foundation that morning. Past an
allee of cedar trunks painted red, his parents' ashes under a fir
leaf birch, and a Buckminster Fuller open-air dome, loaned this
summer by his daughter, Larsen moved his small group toward
Longhouse, a 180-foot-long building hovering above manmade dunes.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Larsen did a quick walk-about in the living room,
beneath its 65-foot skylight. Much of the foundation's loan
collections are on display here. Then he strode the length of the
house, past the center A-frame stairwell, with its two-story Dale
Chihuly lizard-green glass pendant _ it was Larsen who urged
Chihuly, then a weaving student, to take glassblowing lessons after
seeing a project of strips of woven glass _ to the smaller, more
intimate sitting room in Larsen's private quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The peaked room is tented, in the style of Napoleon, in a Larsen
fabric, ``Canterbury,'' a jacquard weave of Egyptian linen designed
in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hoped this tented ceiling and fabric walls would become a
national trend,'' Larsen said. ``It didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign-style room is neatly, snugly enfolded in Larsen's
own personal collections.
</P>
<P>
   There is a Swedish ceramic stove, with two ebony Philippine
armchairs before it. To the side is an 18th-century painted-cloth
Iranian camp table that displays a box turtle shell found on the
property and a 19th-century American patent ladder, which is used
as bookshelves. There are five uncharacteristically delicate Edward
Wormley tables and a good representation of pieces by Wharton
Esherick, the dean of American craft furniture makers, including a
side chair with a puzzle of miners' hammer handles fitted together
to form the base. A pretty varnished rolling table was his
mother's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody made it in the Navy yard in Seattle, for cribbage,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the interior walls at Longhouse are sliding panels,
stretched with fabric, a device based on a Japanese architectural
element, the paper-panel fusama, which creates rooms and conceals
storage. An opaque, woven leather cloth in the bedroom conceals
clothes and bath towels; a sheer linen threaded with hand-clipped
Thai silk floats to showcase, in silhouette, shelves of ceramic
collections. Other panels, rolled aside, reveal a short history of
ceramics _ Yi-xing wine pots, Han Dynasty heads, a Dansk design of
Larsen's and a vase by Dame Lucy Rie, the British studio potter,
and a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Larsen picked the vase from the shelf, turning the milky ceramic
in his hands as though it were a face he was trying to revolve into
view.
</P>
<P>
   ``She became like an abbess, always in white,'' he said.
``Frail, almost like blowing dandelion down.''
</P>
<P>
   Larsen keeps his influences, experiences and memories on a shelf
_ behind him, for others to admire. Weavers live for surprise _
that burst of firsts when paths intersect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I maintained the fantasy, until I was about 34, that I wasn't
really working,'' Larsen said. ``It occurred to me that I spent
more hours doing what I did than anyone I knew. Other people would
call it work,'' he said, composing a salad for lunch _ beets for
color, walnuts for texture, string beans for structure and lettuce
greens for form. ``But I'm just playing very hard.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, in a weakened state, Hurricane Georges crossed the
eastern part of Cuba, bringing windswept rain squalls to portions
of the island. Thursday, Georges is expected to strengthen as its
center emerges over the tepid waters of the Atlantic Ocean. There
is a significant chance that the tropical system will affect
extreme south Florida toward evening and overnight with heavy rain
and strong winds.
</P>
<P>
   Sinking air currents associated with high pressure at 18,000
feet will promote generally dry conditions over the Gulf Coast and
Southeastern states Thursday. Plenty of sunshine will help boost
afternoon readings into the upper 70s and middle 80s over most of
the region. Farther south, intervals of clouds and sunshine will
cover the northern two thirds of the Florida peninsula with
isolated mainly afternoon thunderstorms occurring in the sultry
air.
</P>
<P>
   After a clear and cold start, increasing breezes from the
southwest will transport milder air into the Great Lakes and
Northeast Thursday afternoon. Filaments of high, thin cirrus clouds
will block the sunshine at times across the region. Farther west,
isolated showers and thunderstorms will erupt from the central
Plains to the western Great Lakes as an increasingly moist flow of
air from the southwest intercepts several jet stream disturbances
passing overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Spotty showers will accompany a high altitude low-pressure
center crossing the central Rockies Thursday. Mainly sunny skies
will cover the Pacific states, except for patches of morning low
clouds at the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Narrow Window
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, while all eyes were trained on Hurricane Georges in
the Caribbean, an upstart low-pressure system just off the west
coast of Africa was christened Tropical Storm Jeanne. The position
of the new storm was 21.2 degrees west longitude. Remarkably,
Jeanne became only the third tropical storm to form this far east
over the Atlantic Ocean in more than 100 years. The window of
opportunity for tropical storms to develop over the far eastern
Atlantic is narrow because favorably high sea-surface temperatures
and favorable upper-level winds occur simultaneously only for a
relatively brief time.

SENATE EASILY APPROVES OVERHAUL OF BANKRUPTCY LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate overwhelmingly approved a bill Wednesday
designed to curb the rising number of consumer bankruptcies and
make it more difficult for people to wipe away their debts.
</P>
<P>
   But the measure still faces an uphill fight because it must be
reconciled with a much different House version.
</P>
<P>
   The lopsided vote, 97-1, was in stark contrast to earlier
opposition from Democrats, who said a previous version of the
legislation favored credit card companies. Sen. Paul Wellstone,
D-Minn., was the lone opponent while John Glenn, D-Ohio and John
Warner, R-Va., did not vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The free ride is over,'' Sen. Charles E. Grassley, a
co-sponsor of the bill, said after the vote. ``It's over for
particularly those who would exploit the bankruptcy system as a
tool of financial planning.''
</P>
<P>
   The House, by a 306-118 vote, passed its bill in June.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration supports the Senate bankruptcy
legislation, saying the House bill is ``rigid and arbitrary.'' The
administration also praises the Senate bill for adding more
consumer protections, such as prohibiting creditors from hounding
debtors for money after they have completed bankruptcy proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   With little more than two weeks left before Congress adjourns
for the year, House and Senate negotiators responsible for bridging
major differences between their competing bills have their work cut
out for them.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley, R-Iowa, said one difference is that the House bill
uses a formula to determine whether a debtor files for protection
under Chapter 7 or Chapter 13, while the Senate bill relies on
judges to ascertain how a debtor should file if that filing is
challenged by a creditor.
</P>
<P>
   Under Chapter 7, a consumer can discharge much unsecured debt,
such as credit cards, after liquidating assets and paying as much
as possible to creditors. Under Chapter 13, a debtor commits to
repay at least some of the debt with future earnings over three to
five years.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill automatically would make debtors ineligible for
Chapter 7 if they earned more than the median income _ $51,000 for
a family of four _ and could pay off at least 20 percent of their
unsecured debts.
</P>
<P>
   The more lenient Chapter 7 is favored by debtors: In 1997, 70
percent of all consumer bankruptcy filings were Chapter 7, compared
to 30 percent filing for Chapter 13, according to the American
Bankruptcy Institute, a nonprofit group that represents more than
6,300 bankruptcy professionals.
</P>
<P>
   To make the Senate bankruptcy bill more palatable to Democrats,
senators worked with the White House to add consumer protections to
the bill that emerged from the Senate Judiciary panel in June.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the bill includes a provision by the co-sponsor,
Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., that requires credit card companies to
disclose the length of time it will take and the total cost of
repaying a balance if only the minimum payment is made each month.
</P>
<P>
   Also approved Wednesday was an amendment by Sen. Dianne
Feinstein authorizing the Federal Reserve to study the consumer
credit industry's solicitation and credit practices and to issue
regulations if abuses are found.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein, D-Calif., said irresponsible lending practices are
partly to blame for the record number of consumer bankruptcies _
1.35 million in 1997. ``Responsibility is a two-way street,'' she
said before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said three-quarters of all households carry monthly
credit-card debt and that such debt had doubled from 1993 to 1997,
to $422 billion. She criticized lenders for offering pricey
chocolates, crystal and frequent-flier miles to entice consumers
and said credit cards are often offered to minors.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein also slammed lenders for luring people into credit
with low interest rates, ``and then the interest rate booms up.''
</P>
<P>
   Another change in the bill that helped win broader support is a
provision that says debtors who can repay at least 30 percent of
their unsecured debts, such as credit cards, must file for Chapter
13. It was 20 percent in the earlier version of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also exempted educational savings accounts from
assets that can be seized during bankruptcy proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce hailed the Senate action as ``a
major victory'' for small businesses and retailers.

 &HT;    A 'VIRTUAL MURDERER' STRIKES AT SOCIAL SECURITY FILES
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Naples, Fla., woman had applied for a loan, but
bank officers
</P>
<P>
   told her there was one problem. According to Social Security
records, she was dead.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security Administration eventually uncovered a case
of ``virtual murder,'' acting inspector general James Huse Jr. told
the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee on Wednesday as part of
the panel's continuing investigation of whether private information
is safe on government computers.
</P>
<P>
   Huse said Jorge Yong, a mid-level claims agent at the agency's
Belle Glade, Fla., district office, had had a cyberspace fight with
the unidentified woman that led to his being banned from an
Internet chatroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``He admitted that he had used a co-worker's terminal to make
the date of death input into the victim's record,'' Huse said.
</P>
<P>
   Yong resigned, Huse said, and after pleading guilty to one count
of falsifying personal data, was placed on probation for a year,
ordered to pay $700 to his victim and fined $100 by the U.S.
District Court in Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Social Security computer system contains personal
information on virtually every American,'' said Sen. Fred Thompson,
R-Tenn., the committee chairman. ``If the computer system is
compromised, information about every single one of us in this room
is available for the picking.''
</P>
<P>
   In coordination with the hearing, the General Accounting Office,
the auditing arm of Congress, issued two reports that Thompson said
``raise serious concerns about risks to the public resulting from
information security weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   GAO investigators, the reports said, were able to easily hack
their way into computer systems at both the Social Security
Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which
runs the nation's largest health care delivery system and
guarantees loans on about 20 percent of U.S. homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hacking software has become highly sophisticated and is
readily available off the shelf,'' said Gene Dodaro, the GAO's
assistant comptroller general. ``Even if you had never seen a
computer before, I could show you how to get in by pressing one
(mouse) button,'' he told Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Dodaro testified that ``sensitive information in the VA's
systems, including financial transaction data and personal
information on veterans' medical records and benefit payments, is
vulnerable to inadvertent or deliberate misuse, fraudulent use,
improper disclosure or destruction _ possibly occurring without
detection.''
</P>
<P>
   Huse reviewed the results of ``Operation Pinch,'' which battled
a recent effort to subvert the Social Security Administration's
employees by a ring of ``West African credit card thieves.''
</P>
<P>
   The thieves were aided by federal employees who downloaded
identity information on about 20,000 persons whose credit cards
``were then fraudulently activated by the criminals,'' leading to
bank losses of $70 million, Huse said.
</P>
<P>
   The credit cards were authorized, via toll-free phone lines,
after the information thieves used the card holders' Social
Security numbers, date of birth and mothers' maiden names.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the internal investigation has to the conviction of 12
Social Security employees and three contract security guards. In
return for guilty pleas, all were granted suspended sentences,
including, in some cases, periods of home confinement, and made to
pay only nominal fines.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said the law needed to be changed to provide stiffer
sentences in such internal corruption cases.

 &HT;    ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP TARGETS 'DIRTY DOZEN' FOR DEFEAT
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An environmental group said Wednesday it will spend
$2 million in an effort to defeat 12 congressional candidates,
including a North Carolina hog farmer.
</P>
<P>
   The League of Conservation Voters has targeted Republican Sen.
Lauch(cq) Faircloth, who has extensive farm holdings in eastern
North Carolina, for his ``paltry'' 6 percent voting record on the
league's chosen key environmental issues. Faircloth faces a tough
challenge this year from Raleigh trial lawyer John Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lauch Faircloth is an enemy to the environment,'' said Deb
Callahan, president of the league, a Washington-based environmental
group .
</P>
<P>
   The league blasted Faircloth for voting against the 1995 Safe
Water Drinking Act and for a 1996 incident in which North
Carolina's water quality division fined one of his farms nearly
$50,000 after it discharged more than 80,000 gallons of potato
sludge into a nearby river. Faircloth apologized for the incident,
which killed more than 6,000 fish.
</P>
<P>
   While being at odds with some environmental groups since his
term began in 1992, Faircloth supporters point out that he has more
recently used his position on the Senate Appropriations Committee
to steer millions of dollars to North Carolina environmental
causes. Faircloth's campaign manager, Chuck Fuller, said Wednesday
that the senator is leading the fight to fund research into the
fish-killing pfiesteria(cq) toxin, stop offshore drilling and
protect coastal estuaries.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Faircloth aides said that many of the votes upon
which the league based its decision are not about the environment.
For example, Faircloth said he voted against the 1995 Safe Water
Drinking Act because it contained a provision requiring union wages
for certain construction projects. Faircloth voted in favor of an
almost identical bill the next year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Fuller said the league was a ``liberal Washington,
D.C.-based special interest group'' that is ``out of touch'' and
that Faircloth opponent Edwards has no political experience and no
record on environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan said the league will use the $2 million for TV ads,
grassroots organizing and get-out-the-vote campaigns. The group
hasn't decided if it will run TV ads against Faircloth but promised
to make his record known to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The league announced four other targeted candidates Wednesday:
Rep. Linda Smith, R-Wash., who is running for U.S. Senate;
California state Rep. Tom Bordonaro, a Republican running for a
House seat; incumbent Rep. Robert (Bud) Cramer, D-Ala.; and Rep.
John Ensign, R-Nev., who is running for U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Six other candidates on the groups ``dirty dozen'' list were
announced in June. They include incumbent Reps. Helen Chenoweth,
R-Idaho; John Hostettler, R-Ind.; Bill Redmond, R-N.M.; and Charlie
Stenholm, D-Texas. Also on the list were former Rep. Bob Dornan,
R-Calif., who is trying to win back his seat, and Rep. Mark
Neumann, R-Wis., who is running for a Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan said the final spot on the list will be announced in a
few weeks because the group is still watching Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates should take the list seriously, she said. ``We
targeted 12 folks in 1996 and sent home seven.'' And this year, the
group has $500,000 more to spend.

BASEBALL QUILTS ARE DIAMOND-QUALITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Sliding pads are quilted. There's stitching
on a quilt and stitching on a baseball _ and on umpires' and
catchers' chest protectors.
</P>
<P>
   But once you've seen ``Grand Slam: 20th-Century Baseball
Quilts'' at the Legends of the Game Baseball Museum in Arlington,
you won't need to think of reasons why baseball and quilting have
things in common. You'll just know that a lot of people love both.
</P>
<P>
   Shoehorned into the museum's gallery for temporary exhibits,
``Grand Slam'' features more than 30 quilts. Some are by amateurs,
some by longtime traditional quilters and some by adventuresome art
quilters. It opened this week and will continue through Jan. 17.
</P>
<P>
   The show was curated by Heather Urquhart, a quilter and Oakland
A's fan who lives and works in San Jose, Calif. Urquhart says she
conceived ``Grand Slam'' during the baseball strike in 1994. It
took her three years of contacting quilt guilds and scanning the
Internet to put ``Grand Slam'' together.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the exhibit's more evocative and impressive works are by
Clara Rothmeier, a St. Louis Cardinals (and Mark McGwire) fan from
Gerald, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Rothmeier's ``My Favorite Baseball Stars'' quilt took 10 years
to complete _ and it's easy to see why. She hand-appliqued the 44
portraits on it and, after each player autographed his picture,
embroidered over the signatures. Then she collected about 450 other
autographs on cutouts of baseballs, embroidered those and used them
along the borders and at the corners of each portrait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did the embroidery and the piecing, but my mother and sister
did the actual quilting,'' Rothmeier says. ``I never did learn how
to quilt; isn't that terrible?''
</P>
<P>
   It is tempting to say that devotion such as Rothmeier's must be
innate. In any case, she says she was born into baseball:
Rothmeier's dad was a minor-league player, and she and her siblings
played baseball or softball.
</P>
<P>
   Urquhart is a fan, although she came to her love of baseball
more recently. ``I've been a quilter for 20 years and a serious
baseball fan for 10,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Urquhart says she was looking for quilts ``made more from the
heart than the mind.'' She wanted quilts that would echo a
nostalgia not only for their own traditions, but for ``the good old
days of baseball, when teams were family-owned, when players didn't
go on strike and a family might spend the day at the ballpark.''  &QL;

`ROADSTER': HANDS-ON DEFINITION OF, WELL, AN AUTODIDACT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(lb) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can understand easily enough why Chris Goodrich decided, in
his middle 30s, to build by hand from a kit what he calls ``a
street-legal roadster'' he had fallen in love with.
</P>
<P>
   As he describes the project in the introduction to ``Roadster:
How (and Especially Why) a Mechanical Novice Built a Sports Car
From a Kit'': ``I pictured it as a great adventure, a break from 15
years of writing and editing and reporting, the opportunity to
learn some skills completely foreign to my professional
existence.'' It was a chance to trade in ``abstract ideas for
concrete objects, subjective interpretation for objective
measurement.''
</P>
<P>
   The more elusive question is why he decided to write a book
about the experience, a book that describes the actual steps in the
process and investigates at some length the implications of what he
is doing.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he doesn't do the job well enough. In fact,
``Roadster'' is consistently provocative and diverting. Goodrich
makes you fond of his car, a Caterham Super Seven (based on a 1957
Lotus design), which various car magazines cited by the author have
described as follows: a ``brutal, forgiving, funny, frightening
little vehicle'' that ``doesn't accelerate so much as explode off
the line''; ``as Spartan and unadorned as a rowboat''; to enter it
in winter is ``like climbing into a frozen sleeping bag with a
wooden leg''; ``the Caterham felt like Superman unable to find a
telephone box'' in which ``to change back into his Clark Kent
persona.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodrich describes just enough of the process to keep you
happily engaged. He isn't great at technical description, and the
sparseness of illustrations is frustrating. (There's no picture of
the car he's building.)
</P>
<P>
   But you get the idea of what he's up to: the inventorying of
parts, which to his regret he never completed; the single-handed
mounting of the chassis onto sawhorses; the waiting for missing
pieces to arrive; the bleeding of the brake liners; the lowering of
the motor onto the chassis mounts, and the long-awaited moment of
turning on the ignition: It starts!
</P>
<P>
   And then, after 14 months of work on it: ``I walked around the
Seven, checking for oversights, but found none. My senses were
indescribably alive: I drank in the noise, the smell, the
vibration, the success.'' He concludes, ``The damn car was real!''
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty with ``Roadster'' is the connection between the
activity of building the car and what Goodrich spends most of his
book writing about. For the one does not follow seamlessly from the
other.
</P>
<P>
   Contradictorily, having taken up his project in order to escape
abstraction, in his free time from building the car he goes back to
reading books and thinking abstract thoughts. This leads him to the
paradoxical discovery ``that the automobile was largely responsible
for the specialized, balkanized, expertise-dominated world I longed
to flee.''
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate what he means by this he launches on a history of
the car and the social consequences of its mass production, among
them the obvious ones like air pollution, traffic jams and road
deaths, as well as more subtle ones like ``the suburb, the mall,
the office park, the billboard, even talk radio,'' ``the asphalting
of the landscape'' and ``the fact that more U.S. land is devoted to
autos than to housing.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the most significant consequence of the car for Goodrich was
the creation of the assembly line by Henry Ford and the invention
of planned obsolescence by Alfred P. Sloan Jr. of General Motors.
As Goodrich sees it, these innovations combined to rob work of its
core meaning, to strip labor, as he puts it, ``of everything but
monetary value.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes sense as Goodrich presents it. But such heavy
analysis eventually compels the reader to look more closely at what
the author is doing by building his car. Is he really emulating
heroes of his like Thoreau and Simone Weil, who altered their lives
radically to explore the true meaning of work? If so, how could he
afford to give up his job as a journalist writing for California
Lawyer and spend $27,000 for his car kit?
</P>
<P>
   His overt answer to this question is that while building his car
in his brother's garage in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., he worked
three days a week for a New York City trade magazine, that his wife
was an editor in a New York publishing house and that he had socked
away the money from a house in Berkeley Hills, Calif., that he had
sold at a hefty profit.
</P>
<P>
   But between the lines you read that he comes from a family of
wealth. His forebears include Elizur Goodrich, a Yale divinity
professor whose family ``almost certainly'' invested in Eli
Whitney's firearms plant just outside New Haven, Conn., and Noah
Webster, the dictionary maker. His father, a professor of classical
Chinese language and literature, ``needed to work for his own
psychological health.''
</P>
<P>
   Discussing Veblen's ``Theory of the Leisure Class,'' Goodrich
ends up by asking: ``Could I really be building the Seven, this
vehicle of quintessentially honorific crudeness, to advertise my
economic and social freedom? To patronize rather than to learn,
exploit rather than experience?'' He concludes, ``I hoped not, but
those questions remained unanswered to this day.''
</P>
<P>
   The feeling you have when closing ``Roadster'' is that these
questions are answered, that by begging comparison with ``Walden''
and ``Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,'' his book seems a
little frivolous and self-indulgent. This isn't to say that it
isn't good fun and stimulating. Only that up against the
heavyweights, ``Roadster'' comes away with its fenders a little
bent.

<P>
   A new scholarship program at a California state college is one
of the first in the nation to give students computers instead of
financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   By handing out $2,400 Fujitsu laptops to 40 incoming freshman,
aid officials at California State University at San Marcos hope to
narrow a technology gap among lower-income students that they think
contributes to the low retention rate for first-year students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have tremendous concerns with low-income students,'' said
Paul E. Phillips, director of financial aid and scholarship at the
campus, in north San Diego County, where, like elsewhere in the
22-campus system, about half of the students qualify for some
financial aid. ``We had students who had never turned a computer
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Since faculty at the nine-year-old campus expect all of the
5,000 students to turn in assignments on computer disks or by
e-mail, computer access is as much a requirement at San Marcos as
textbooks and backpacks.
</P>
<P>
   And while computers are available to students on campus, access
may be impractical for those students who have family or work
obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Aid officials decided their resources would be most valuable
buying PCs and software directly from a manufacturer and winning a
volume discount. ``We wanted to be sure they had every
technological advantage they could to succeed,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for public access to digital services argue that the
inability to harness technology's power will undercut economic and
social advancement by the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The San Marco laptop recipients are known as Evers computer
scholars, named after their benefactor, the late Leonard Evers, a
former resident of the region. He bequeathed $2 million for the
college's needy students.
</P>
<P>
   The Evers scholars, selected from among 60 applicants with B
average high school grades who also wrote essays, also are
receiving $5,000 in monetary grants to cover tuition, books and
some expenses. A full-time student's costs average $12,000 a year
at a state college, which sets minimum entry requirements of
grade-point average and test scores.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the laptop, loaded with Microsoft's Windows 95 and Excel
spreadsheet programs, the students also spent the first day of the
semester learning how to click and close and dial up cyberspace
under the tutelage of the campus computer-lab staff.
</P>
<P>
   While self-help with their own computer glitches is encouraged,
the students also have been provided with a special call-in number
for technical support. ``They get V.I.P. treatment,'' Phillips
said. They also get to keep the laptops if they graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips says it's too soon to look for results, although he is
already hoping this year's laptop recipients become Evers scholars'
mentors next year.
</P>
<P>
   Financial aid experts say the unusual award at California State
University at San Marcos is likely to be copied as a computer
requirement becomes more prevalent at other campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colleges that require computers, the cost is allowable as part
of the expense budget,'' said John D. Joyce, a manager for the
College Board scholarship service. He said the San Marcos program
is the first he is aware of that defrays costs with equipment
rather than cash.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, students borrowed 60 percent of $55.7 billion
awarded in financial aid during the 1996-1997 year, the most recent
figures available.  &QL;

 &HT;    MILITARY MEDICAL SYSTEM FACES BUDGET SHORTFALL
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon's suggested budget for military
medicine next year will fall as much $600 million short of the
level necessary to provide acceptable medical care in Army, Navy
and Air Force hospitals and clinics, congressional staff members
have learned.
</P>
<P>
   The $16 billion budget for fiscal 1999, which is in the last
stages of congressional approval, goes into effect Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The House National Security subcommittee on personnel has
scheduled a hearing for Thursday to grill the surgeons general of
the Army, Navy and Air Force on how their budgets could be hundreds
of millions of dollars short the week before they take effect.
</P>
<P>
   A congressional staff member said the $600 million figure was
based on estimates by the three surgeons general of the differences
between the appropriations they are to receive and the costs they
expect to incur.
</P>
<P>
   Other Pentagon officials say a shortfall of around $200 million
is more likely, the staff member said.
</P>
<P>
   The staff member said the looming shortfall developed because
military hospitals have been forced to defer medical equipment
purchases and building maintenance repeatedly in recent years to
cover other budget shortfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, the staff member said, the postponed expenditures
accumulate, and have now reached the point where the surgeons
general have complained that they can postpone them no longer.
</P>
<P>
   The staff member said the crisis in next year's budget was
discovered accidentally by members of the subcommittee staff as
they reviewed Defense Department e-mail on an unrelated subject.
</P>
<P>
   In a message to a hospital commander, one of three surgeons
general expressed the belief that he could not operate within the
budget he was given. The e-mail appeared to have been inadvertently
included in those the subcommittee was reviewing.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence that the upcoming budget will provide less than the
surgeons general have said they must have in order to pay for
acceptable medical care comes to light at a time when Pentagon
budget writers are considering downsizing and consolidating several
military hospitals to avoid an even larger budget crunch five years
from now.
</P>
<P>
   In a draft memorandum marked ``secret,'' analysts for the
Defense Resources Board suggested that five military medical
centers, including the facility at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
in Dayton, Ohio, might have to be downsized to ``community
hospitals'' in order to meet budget shortages between 2000 and
2005.
</P>
<P>
   The memorandum also suggested that Walter Reed Army Medical
Center in Washington and the National Naval Medical Center at
Bethesda, Md., might have to be consolidated.
</P>
<P>
   Other medical centers the budget planners suggested downsizing
were Keesler Medical Center in Mississippi, David Grant Medical
Center at Travis Air Force Base in California, Eisenhower Army
Medical Center at Ft. Gordon, Ga., and William Beaumont Army
Medical Center at El Paso, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   They also suggested that Brooke Army Medical Center and the Air
Force's Wilford Hall Medical Center in San Antonio could be
consolidated.
</P>
<P>
   The memorandum appears to be primarily an internal discussion
document for Pentagon budget planners as they consider out-year
revenues and obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Army Col. Chuck Partridge, legislative affairs director
of the National Association for the Uniformed Services, said
Wednesday he was told by Pentagon budget analysts that the military
medical system could face budget shortfalls totaling nearly $6
billion between 2000 and 2005 at current spending trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem at the Pentagon is not in the Office of Health
Affairs,'' said Partridge. ``Budget managers over there have just
continued to put the squeeze on them and they are left scrambling,
trying to provide care they know they cannot provide.''

SOON YO-YOS WILL BE ADDED TO PILE OF LONELY TOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hooray! The yo-yos are back! No, not the Australian hip-hop
group that tried to rap to classical music. Although I did so enjoy
their one hit, ``Beethoven Is The Bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   No, I'm referring to the children's toy that most of us enjoyed
despite our inability to walk the dog, rock the baby or loop the
loop. Frankly, I'd forgotten about the little gizmos until my
children begged me to buy them one at the toy store.
</P>
<P>
   It seems we have a new craze for the winter. Every six months or
so, it's something else with these youngsters. Let's see, how many
neglected toys do we have around here?
</P>
<P>
   Well, there are those Giga Pets, the computerized animals that
you have to feed and care for, or they die. Let's just say that I
hope my boys are more nurturing by the time they have kids of their
own. When I commented on the untimely demise of one of their pets,
my son said, ``Oh, it's OK. All I have to do is press the reset
button whenever I feel like playing with it.''
</P>
<P>
   If only parents had that option.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, we were big on Pogs. Pogs are the newest version of
milk caps, except cardboard disks have replaced the metal milk
caps. To win the game, you throw your pog at a stack of pogs on the
floor, and whichever pogs flip over belong to you. It's probably
the stupidest game I've ever played. Besides, the pogs don't hold
up real well in the washing machine. What else?
</P>
<P>
   Footballs with tails, skateboards, water guns that pump out 50
gallons of pressurized water before you have to refill them, and on
and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, between the birthdays, Christmases and other
special occasions, we've managed to accumulate an arsenal of dusty
toys that my kids ignore until we have a young guest who wants to
play with one. Suddenly, that faded Pog game is an heirloom to be
admired, envied even, but definitely not touched.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, they could not possibly care less about Beanie
Babies. I bought them one, Frog Beanie, or whatever, and they used
him for a hockey puck. It was not a pretty sight.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they're clamoring for the new generation of hyper yo-yos
with the transaxle design for maximum speed. Huh?
</P>
<P>
   ``Do a book report on the origin of yo-yos, and if it's good,
I'll buy each of you one Yomega Firestorm as requested,'' I said in
answer to their fervent petitions.
</P>
<P>
   Their faces fell and, although they spoke no words of protest, I
read their minds: ``Of all the women in the universe, why did we
have to get her as a mother?''
</P>
<P>
   The yo-yo has an interesting history. It was invented in China
ten centuries ago. Originally, it was made from ivory disks and
silk thread. At one time, yo-yos were used as weapons for hunting
in the Philippines. Donald Duncan made them popular in the United
States in the 1920s, and the Duncan yo-yo is still a leading brand.
Today, yo-yos are primarily made of plastic and twine.
</P>
<P>
   The history lesson and my impression that the toy would help
build manual dexterity persuaded me to buy a couple of inexpensive
yo-yos. What on earth was I thinking? In the first hour, two
fragile household items were damaged. You really could kill an
animal with one of those things.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this too shall pass. What will it be next? Jacks?
Hula Hoops? Pierced toes? They say that whatever goes around comes
around. I sure hope so. I've got a Cabbage Patch doll around here
somewhere. She'd make a good football.  &QL;

in what Mrs. Clinton called ``sort of a slumber party,'' Mandela
was being honored today with the Congressional Gold Medal in a
ceremony at the Capitol Rotunda. The frail, 80-year-old Mandela led
a standing ovation in the East Room after Rev. Bernice King,

   NEIMAN-SUIT _ ATLANTA _ Around 1 p.m. on Nov. 3, 1996, Dianne
Lynn Cooper, walked into Neiman Marcus at Lenox Square, picked out
seven items and went into the dressing room to try them on. Because
she was wearing a winter coat, carrying a large handbag and looked
suspicious, store security guards were alerted. When she left the
fitting room, a guard went inside and counted less than seven items
in the changing room. Cooper was confronted in the parking lot
outside and, according to strikingly different versions of events _
whether you believe Cooper's or the security guards', she was
either accosted, groped and then strip-searched or she became
unreasonably hysterical and took off her own clothes (inside the
store's security offices after being taken screaming down an
escalator) to prove she had taken nothing. In fact, she took
nothing and the security guard missed items in the fitting room. A
verdict in the lawsuit is possible Wednesday morning. (Rankin,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   LOTTERY-KIDNAPPING _ ATLANTA _ Dwayne Bryant was lucky enough to
win $5,100 on Georgia Lotto's pick three game. Bragging about it
brought him plenty of bad luck. He was kidnapped Sunday by three
gunmen, who told his wife to bring the winnings to an Atlanta park
or they would kill her husband. Atlanta police saved Bryant. The
kidnappers got away without the money. (Good, Atlanta

   TEXAS-INSURANCE _ AUSTIN, Texas _ A state lawmaker is weighing
in to a fight over the availability and use of insurance reports
that he says could prove insurers are illegally denying coverage to
Texans in poor and minority-dominated areas. (Elizondo Jr., Austin

MEAT DIET: LOSE WEIGHT _ AND YOUR MIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURI NOTARO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - I knew exactly what I was doing. I had given the
matter a great deal of thought, and my words were deliberate. I
knew I was about to cheat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really need you right away,'' I quietly stressed to the man
on the other end of the phone, while my husband sat in the living
room, watching TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an emergency! I have to see you soon. Please HURRY!!''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, OK,'' the man agreed, and hung up.
</P>
<P>
   I walked into the living room and flashed my husband a quick
smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you want for dinner?'' I asked, without any trace of
my deceit.
</P>
<P>
   He looked at me disgustedly. ``No more meat,'' he said simply.
``I can't eat any more meat.''
</P>
<P>
   I knew how he felt. I was really sick of meat, too. Ever since
we had started a high-protein, no-carbohydrate diet two weeks
before, we had eaten more meat than the entire Clan of the Cave
Bear in one hunting season. We learned about the diet from our
friends, Jon and Kevin, who had lost an amazing amount of weight in
just two weeks by cutting out bread and sugar from their meals. It
sounded like a dream. Eat all the cheese, butter, cream and meat
you want, and watch the pounds drop from your butt like fleas off a
hairless dog.
</P>
<P>
   After thinking about it for 15 minutes and deciding that we were
prime candidates for this diet, I sprang it on my husband that we
were going to start the following Monday to lose the 20 pounds we
had gained during the course of our marital bliss. I stocked the
fridge with roasts, chops, steaks and cheeses, some from animals
I'd only seen on the Discovery Channel.
</P>
<P>
   During our first dinner, we were enthusiastic. Hovering over our
plates piled with steak, we dug in, convinced that each mouthful of
flesh got us that much closer to wearing old jeans. In that first
week, one, two, three, four pounds magically disappeared while we
slept. I had visions of myself in three weeks' time, wearing a cute
little sleeveless J. Crew dress without the disturbing presence of
Hoppy and Bob, the two swags of flesh that live under each of my
arms. I had dreams of tucking my shirt in, and actually fastening a
seat belt in the car without bumping into my belly baguette first.
</P>
<P>
   We chewed and chewed and chewed. Five, six, seven, eight pounds
floated away. Life without bread and sugar was indeed nearly empty,
but watching the scale drove me on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey,'' I asked my husband a week and a half into the diet,
``pick me up to see if I feel lighter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said tiredly, almost in a whine. ``My shoulder still
hurts from picking you up yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, pick me up,'' I coaxed. ``Pick me up like those
dancing kids on the Gap commercial. I'll kick my legs this time!''
</P>
<P>
   During the second week, however, things were beginning to drag,
even though we had lost 12 pounds each. We had eaten enough meat
that we should have been branded and pierced with an ear tag. Our
back molars had been ground down to the size of Tic Tacs. I knew
things were bad when I passed a Taco Bell and my mouth watered, but
my desperation was sealed after I saw a fat family buying a bag of
pretzels at Smitty's and I burst into tears. I was ready to quit
the diet and lose the remaining eight pounds by shaving my legs.
Frantic, I called Jon and Kevin for support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't give in,'' Jon urged me. ``Be strong. A lady at work
lost so much weight that she looks like Karen Carpenter. Now, put
down the box of Oreo cereal and get yourself a nice ball of
mozzarella.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you need a treat, make the recipe we gave you for the
`Cheezy Beef' popsicles,'' Kevin suggested. ``That will pep you
up!''
</P>
<P>
   ``How can anything pep me up?'' I questioned. ``Because of all
the cheese and meat I've eaten, I haven't gone Number 2 since
August. I'm a walking septic tank!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe she's eaten too much meat,'' I heard Jon whisper to
Kevin. ``This sounds like mad cow disease.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need to be shot,'' I hissed into the phone. ``I just
want to eat a roll. I found some hot dog buns from the Fourth of
July on top of the refrigerator. I'm going to take a bite!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Step away from the buns!'' they both shouted over the phone.
``We're going to talk you down. Put your hand to your face. Push
in. What do you feel?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The nubs that used to be my teeth,'' I answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go higher,'' they said. ``Now what do you feel?''
</P>
<P>
   I did feel something. ``I don't know what that is,'' I replied.
``It feels . . . hard. And it's kind of . . . round.''
</P>
<P>
   ``IT'S A BONE!'' they said. ``IT'S A BONE!''
</P>
<P>
   ``A bone?'' I said weakly. ``I have bones in my face?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes!'' Jon exclaimed. ``And you have more! They're all over
your body!''
</P>
<P>
   I looked at my hands. I saw BONES. At my elbow. BONES. Right
under my neck. BONES.
</P>
<P>
   I had BONES.
</P>
<P>
   And this was what I was thinking as I hung up with Jon and Kevin
and dialed another number with my bony fingers, telling the man at
the other end that it was an emergency, and that I needed to see
him right away.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   Within 30 minutes, he was at the door, knocking. I took the box
from his hands. ``I knew I could depend on you,'' I told him
earnestly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only a pizza, lady,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   My husband looked stunned. ``A pizza? You ordered a pizza?'' he
stuttered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' I answered without flinching. ``We have suffered. We
deserve this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a lot of weird things, lady,'' the pizza guy said.
``But I've never had anybody order a pizza without the crust.''
</P>
<P>
   My husband just looked at me, his hand on his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep your hand right there,'' I said to him. ``Now, push
in.'' &QL;

IS WIFFLE BALL READY TO HIT MAJOR LEAGUE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Boston Red Sox legend Ted Williams once said hitting a
baseball was the hardest thing to do in sports.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Williams never tried hitting a Wiffle ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you just don't know where the ball is going,'' says
Jay McGregor of Poway, Calif., who played in a recent San Diego
tournament and is traveling with his teammates to play this coming
weekend in Tempe, Ariz.``You just have to react.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, about 150 teams will take their hacks at Diablo
Stadium in the first Yard Ball tournament, a four-on-four Wiffle
ball competition sponsored by Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-city tour will expand to 20 cities next year. Eventually,
plans call for the tournament to stop in all 30 major-league
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Yard Ball applies a majority of baseball's rules with a few
twists. For example, four balls are a walk and three strikes are an
out. But a batter also is out if he or she fails to swing at a ball
that lands in the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen to 18 miniature diamonds will be constructed with
outfield fences (100 feet to center field), chalk baselines and
dugouts.
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego, players did their best imitations of Mark McGwire
and Sammy Sosa and feasted on the short fences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of those guys were just crushing the ball,'' says Larry
Eyler, McGregor's teammate.
</P>
<P>
   But with a perforated ball that gets caught in the wind and
takes nasty twists and turns on its way to the plate, Eyler
contends that pitching is key. Some have it down to a science _
strange grips, different release points, perhaps a little scuffing
for that extra movement.
</P>
<P>
   But McGregor, the Randy Johnson of his team, scoffs at the
mechanics involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just pick it up and throw it,'' says McGregor, a lefty who
tossed a no-hitter in San Diego _ but still lost. ``All I can tell
you is just throw it as hard as you can.'' &QL;

KIRK FRANKLIN FANS ARE DOUBLY BLESSED THIS MONTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Holy synergy! Fort Worth's Kirk Franklin not only has an eagerly
awaited CD out this month, but his new autobiography as well.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin, the first gospel artist to sell a million copies of a
debut CD, is set to release (on Sept. 29) his fourth CD with the
Family, ``The Nu Nation Project.'' At the same time, his
autobiography, ``Church Boy,'' will be in stores.
</P>
<P>
   The CD's first single, ``Lean on Me,'' features vocals by Bono,
R. Kelly, Mary J. Blige and Crystal Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin, whose ``Stomp'' was a big crossover hit a couple of
years back, is the first gospel artist to have a CD ship platinum,
according to ``Billboard;'' 300,000 copies of the CD are going out
initially.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's huge,'' says Drew Dawson, program director with KHVN/970
AM in North Texas. ``The thing about it is, everything Kirk has
done so far has been so wildly successful and so good that people
can't wait for the CD.''
</P>
<P>
   Dawson says he has heard most of the CD and calls it
``amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The writing is superb and the musicianship is awesome _ when
you hear strings you hear real strings, not a guy with a
synthesizer, and when you hear horns they're real horns, not two
guys with synthesizers,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's personal songs where he's dug deep down into his heart
that'll touch people. You can identify it immediately as Kirk, but
it's not cookie-cutter, formula stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Church Boy'' will hit mainstream and Christian bookstores with
an initial printing of 98,000 copies, according to Word Publishing
spokeswoman Pamela McClure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest printings are usually 30,000 to 50,000, but
there's so much demand for this,'' McClure says. ``It'll be
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The book's publication date was pushed back from the spring so
that it would tie in with the CD release. There will be a blurb
advertising the book inside the CD, and vice versa.  &QL;

&HT;        CLINTON, GOP PUMMELED IN POLL
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Paul Kane  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Sept. 23 -- Public opinion has ricocheted completely
against the sex-and-lies investigation of President Clinton,
leaving both the president and Congress in poor standing, according
to a national poll released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Within 36 hours of the broadcast Clinton's grand jury testimony,
the president received a slight bump in approval from the public
but still remains an uninspiring figure to most Americans. And the
Congress -- both Republicans and Democrats -- has lost serious
support for its handling of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has all the elements of a triangular firing squad,
although the wounds are self inflicted,'' said John Zogby,
president Zogby International, an independent polling firm based in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Zogby's findings confirmed what earlier polls had showed: that
the much-ballyhooed testimony had not hurt Clinton. The president's
job approval rating jumped from 55 percent, a week ago, to 60.9
percent, according to a sampling of 898 likely voters Monday and
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton continues to remain in the muck in terms of how
voters view him as a person. Asked if they were ``ashamed to have
Bill Clinton as your president'', 51.8 percent said yes, an almost
2 percent increase from the week before.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not out of hot water by any stretch of the
imagination,'' Zogby said.
</P>
<P>
   Political consultants pay particular attention to Zogby's
findings because he polls likely voters, the people who will impact
elections, and because in recent years he has proven to be one of
the most accurate in the business. Polling numbers among likely
voters are consistently a bit lower for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   While Zogby had a mixed bag of polling for Clinton, his poll
showed unequivocally negative results for Congress, saying there
was indeed a backlash for releasing the videotape.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, 43.4 percent of likely voters had a favorable
impression of how Republicans were handling the investigation.
After the broadcast, only 30.1 percent approved of the GOP's probe.
</P>
<P>
   Even fewer likely voters, 25.5 percent, approve of how the
congressional Democrats have responded to the investigation, which
Zogby attributed to the their overall absence from the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the overall findings, however, lurk several major
contradictions in public sentiment, showing that there is no
``critical mass'' of opinion for anything other than a quick
resolution to the crisis, Zogby said.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the public now believe Clinton lied under oath
before the grand jury, Zogby said. And 55.7 percent of likely
voters think, if he perjured himself before the grand jury, he
should ``consider leaving office.''
</P>
<P>
   But, asked if Clinton should currently consider leaving office,
the public said no: 52.4 percent against leaving, 43.9 for
consideration of resignation.
</P>
<P>
   And judging Clinton's impact on congressional elections could
vary from region to region. In the East, 58.1 percent held a
favorable impression of Clinton, which measures people's wider view
of the president as a person, not just job performance.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for a pair of Pennsylvania Democrats, Joseph
Hoeffel of Montgomery County and Pat Casey of Scranton, trying to
take over Republican-held House seats.
</P>
<P>
   That contrasts sharply from the rest of the country, especially
the South and the Central/Great Lakes region, where Clinton's
favorability ratings are below 48 percent. Which could spell
disaster for incumbent House Democrats from those areas.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton will be persona non grata on the campaign trail.
Nationally, 31.1 percent of voters said they would be less likely
to vote for a candidate if Clinton made a campaign stop in the
district, compared to just 14.6 percent who would be more likely to
support the candidate. The rest said it wouldn't make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congressional Republicans may have overplayed their hand in
the release of the videotape,'' Zogby said, but added, ``There are
no heroes here, there are no winners. ... There is enough in this
poll to disappoint all the players.''
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE THE NUMBERS:
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's job performance rating:
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 22 -- 60.9 percent approve 38.3 percent disapprove
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 14 -- 55.0 percent approve 44.8 percent disapprove
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans performance during scandal:
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 22 -- 30.1 percent approve 64.6 percent disapprove
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 14 -- 43.4 percent approve 49.7 percent disapprove
</P>
<P>
   Should President Clinton consider leaving office:
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 22 -- 43.9 percent, yes 52.4 percent, no
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 14 -- 45.3 percent, yes 46.4 percent, no

GROUP SAYS NEW IMMIGRATION LAW MAY CURTAIL TRADE WITH CANADA,
MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A group of lawmakers and business leaders is
redoubling efforts to revoke a new immigration law that they
contend will cause extensive traffic delays in U.S. border
communities and squeeze regional economies that subsist on Canadian
and Mexican trade.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a provision in a 1996 law that mandated the
installation of a computerized system by Oct. 1 to record
departures from the United States of each non-U.S. citizen and
match them with arrival records.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to discourage foreign nationals from staying beyond
the time allowed by their visas.
</P>
<P>
   ``A new immigration law threatens to cause massive traffic
delays of 12 hours or more at the U.S. borders. It will take full
effect on Oct. 1, unless Congress acts now. The new law is
burdensome, disruptive, costly and goes too far,'' the Washington,
D.C.-based organization Americans for Better Borders said in a
statement Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those delays could cost U.S. companies and local economies
millions in lost sales, lower productivity and higher overhead,''
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's highly unlikely that the Immigration and
Naturalization Service will meet the Oct. 1 deadline for putting
the system in place.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans for Better Borders, which plans a news conference
Thursday to demand that Congress revoke the provision known as
Section 110, is a coalition of lawmakers and major business
organizations. The coalition includes the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, General Motors Corp.,
Eastman Kodak Co. and Chrysler Corp.
</P>
<P>
   About 14 House lawmakers, mainly from communities along the
Canadian and Mexican borders, also are expected to attend. They
include Reps. Jack Quinn, R-N.Y., Jack Metcalf, R-Wash., and John
LaFalce, D-N.Y. Texas lawmakers who also may attend are Republican
Rep. Henry Bonilla and Democratic Reps. Ciro Rodriguez and
Silvestre Reyes.
</P>
<P>
   But there is strong support for the provision.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, the chairman of the House immigration
subcommittee, has been outspoken about the need for a
state-of-the-art entry-exit system. ``This is a vital
national-security issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without such a system, our government has no idea who is
coming to the United States and whether they leave when they are
supposed to do so,'' Smith said last month.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster his case, Smith has pointed to a Canadian government
study from last spring that concluded: ``Most of the world's
terrorist groups have established themselves in Canada, seeking
safe haven, setting up operational bases and attempting to gain
access to the U.S.A.''
</P>
<P>
   Setting up such a system so that trade and tourism don't suffer
will not be easy, Smith said. ``But the technology exists to do
this in a way that will expedite legitimate border crossings while
addressing the threats of terrorists, drug smugglers and illegal
immigration,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   However, INS officials have conceded in recent weeks that they
won't meet the Oct. 1 deadline. And as a result, the deadline will
come and go with no measurable impact along the U.S. border, said
Allen Kay, a spokesman for Rep. Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that the INS didn't do their job,'' Kay said.
``This is hardly the first time that the INS has missed a
congressionally mandated deadline.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith isn't likely to give into demands that the border system
be scuttled, Kay said. In fact, Smith is pushing for Congress to
force the INS to mandate a ``date-certain'' for the entry system to
be put into use.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what the congressman is hoping for and he thinks that
will happen,'' Kay said.

TRUMAN SCANDALS SEEM QUAINT COMPARED TO TODAY'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN BURNES  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Kansas City, Mo.) _ Harry S. Truman didn't want the 1944
Democratic vice presidential nomination, he told friends.
</P>
<P>
   He had a skeleton in his closet.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, it soon emerged that Truman had put his wife, Bess,
on the payroll of his Senate office staff. Bess earned $4,500 a
year. The incident suggests that Truman, renowned today for his
personal integrity, nevertheless suffered occasional lapses of
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   It also suggests that, when compared to the material dredged up
in today's scorched-earth politics, Truman's skeletons were quaint.
</P>
<P>
   Political enemies, of course, were eager to list Truman's
shortcomings _ ranging from his connections to machine boss Tom
Pendergast to his alleged brief membership in the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   But they never found evidence of sexual misbehavior. More than
once, Truman literally fled from temptation.
</P>
<P>
   One day in the 1920s, while serving as Jackson County presiding
judge, Truman had knocked on a door inside a Kansas City hotel.
</P>
<P>
   A blond woman wearing only a negligee answered. The future
president, who apparently smelled a rat after being asked to go to
the hotel room, turned and ran.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel incident illustrates Truman's fear of being entrapped,
according to Truman friend Edgar Hinde, who had accompanied Truman
to the hotel at Truman's request. Hinde, who has since died,
recalled the incident in a 1962 oral history for the Truman
Library.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a phobia'' about such situations, Hinde said.
</P>
<P>
   Truman's relentless decorum seemed strange even to Hinde, who
recalled how Truman remained on the alert for compromising
situations while attending American Legion conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had his room there, and naturally everybody would kind of
gravitate to his room,'' Hinde said in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   ``If some fellow brought a woman in there, or his wife, even,
I've seen him pick up his hat and coat and take off out of there,
and that would be the last you'd see of him until those women left.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just didn't want any women around his room in a hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ku Klux Klan rumor, meanwhile, dogged Truman for years. It
surfaced in 1944, after Truman accepted the vice presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1920s, the Klan had been an active force in Missouri
state politics. Most Truman biographers agree that Truman met with
Klan leaders while running for eastern Jackson County judge, and
even went so far as to forward a $10 membership fee.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly changed his mind, however, after learning that one
condition of Klan support was that Truman could not hire any
Catholics in county government.
</P>
<P>
   Truman's political sponsors, the Pendergasts, were Catholics. So
were about 90 percent of the men who had served in the artillery
battery Truman had commanded in World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Truman asked for his $10 back.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Truman supporters were concerned enough in 1944 to attack
the allegation. The Kansas City Jewish Chronicle published an
advertisement denouncing the rumor with statements from Samuel
Mayerberg, a prominent Kansas City rabbi, as well as Eddie
Jacobson, Truman's former haberdashery partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is regretted that rumor-mongers...should besmirch the
character of a fine American,'' Jacobson wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Some Truman haters had special zeal.
</P>
<P>
   One of them was William Bradford Huie, editor of American
Mercury magazine. In the early 1950s, he wrote several anti-Truman
articles and once visited Kansas City and Independence to research
his topic.
</P>
<P>
   One of his stops was to visit Sue Gentry, longtime journalist
with the Examiner in Independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came into the office and said, `I know all this Pollyanna
stuff about Harry Truman, but I am looking for some dirt,' ''
Gentry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Sir, if I knew any dirt about Harry Truman I would
certainly never tell you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Huie persisted, asking to see the Examiner obituary of David
Wallace, father of Bess Wallace Truman, who had committed suicide
in 1903.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all this, however, Truman's enemies knew they would find
no hint of sexual scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Even before he was married, Truman was a straight arrow. In his
autobiography, Truman described how, like a lot of American
soldiers waiting to come home from France after World War I,
received a three-day leave to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   For posterity, the future president listed his Paris itinerary.
It included a performance of the Folies Bergeres, the famous
women's dance review.
</P>
<P>
   ``A disgusting performance,'' Truman wrote.

 Clinton's job performance rating rises after broadcast of
testimony  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN and KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton staged a mini-comeback of sorts
Tuesday following his unprecedented video telecast of his grand
jury appearance in the Monica Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight polls after Monday's broadcast pushed up the
president's job performance rating. A CBS poll showed the biggest
jump, nine points after his testimony aired, with 68 percent of the
respondents still approving of the job he is doing.
</P>
<P>
   Constituent calls to some members of Congress, which had been
running heavily against Clinton last week, began to tilt more in
his direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thursday and Friday of last week, it was as heavy as I've ever
seen it,'' said Republican Sen. Mike DeWine of Ohio. ``We've never
seen people as agitated. It was running 8-1 against the president.
Yesterday it changed. Over half was for the president.''
</P>
<P>
   And although some Republicans said they expect a formal inquiry
of impeachment to reach the House floor in the next two weeks, at
least one proposal to defuse the political crisis before it gets to
an impeachment stage was making the rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat, has suggested that
Clinton testify before the House Judiciary Committee, which must
decide whether to begin an impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said he thought Clinton should
come to Capitol Hill. House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde said if
the president ``wants to testify, we would certainly hear from
him.'' But Hyde also said any talk of a deal was ``premature.''
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the president
appreciated Kerry's ``desire to find a constructive solution to
this matter and to bring this matter to some kind of closure.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the White House, however, should not be in a position of
suggesting what kind of compromise might be put on the table. But
McCurry, added, `` A lot of people have got ideas. We will continue
those conversations.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats continued to talk of a censure, perhaps accompanied by
a financial penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats steeled for further bombshells in the Lewinsky
investigation when more boxes of testimony by presidential
secretary Betty Currie and presidential friend Vernon Jordan are
released. But they took the constituent calls and the polls as a
glimmer of light after weeks of gloom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overnight polling data suggests the American people have a
more sympathetic view of the president than they had before, and I
think that a reflection of what they view as to the (lack of)
fairness of this process,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle, a Democrat of South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   The mood of many Republicans was still for an all-out aggressive
pursuit of the president, which could mean a floor vote telling the
Judiciary Committee to proceed before adjournment Oct. 9. That vote
could make many Democrats uncomfortable before the November
election.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Assistant Majority Leader Don Nickles, a Republican of
Oklahoma, said his office's calls were still running overwhelming
against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's changed,'' Nickles said. ``Did he perjure
himself before the grand jury? Did he perjure himself in the
deposition? Those are very serious charges that he's in trouble
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Ashcroft's office reported that more than 80 percent
of about 5,300 people who called in last week wanted Clinton to
resign or be impeached. On Monday and Tuesday, that was down to
about 67 percent, although the number of calls was considerably
lower, too, said the Missouri Republican's press secretary, Steve
Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   In Sen. Kit Bond's Washington office, calls had dropped from
almost 90 percent against Clinton last week, to about 60 percent
against him for the first two days of this week, said Leanne
Jerome, an aide to the senator from Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa said the
calls to his office had narrowed from 7-1 against the president a
week ago to being ``split, 50-50.''

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: TO SOUTHERNERS, A BELLE IS NOT A BUTTERFLY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., La.)  (lb) 
 By BERNARD HOLLAND    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Witnessing Andre Previn and Colin Graham struggle with the
Southern mind on Saturday night at the San Francisco Opera was like
getting transmissions from some distant moon exploration. Previn
was the composer for a brand-new operatic setting of ``A Streetcar
Named Desire,'' Tennessee Williams' famous take on New Orleans
life. Graham was the director.
</P>
<P>
   The composer represents a happy collision of German culture,
jazz and the Hollywood studios. The director, an Englishman, has
been creating opera productions in the United States for almost a
generation. Both have probably traveled south during their lives
but appeared not even to have rolled down the car window.
</P>
<P>
   I can say this as a Southerner. And though I came north more
than 50 years ago and seldom go back, people like me still feel a
proprietary expertise about what Southern is and isn't. Does this
make our opinions more important? Not always.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Streetcar'' sent me back to an Irish writers' seminar
held at the University of Virginia many years ago and attended by
eager English majors like myself. Elizabeth Bowen was there, also
Sean O'Faolain, Padraic Colum and Oliver St. John Gogarty, James
Joyce's model for Buck Mulligan in ``Ulysses.'' All knew Dublin
from a lifetime of living in it. Apart from our reading of Joyce,
the city was as real to us as outer space.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of ``Ulysses'' soon arose, and we brandished our
well-marked copies like loyal Maoists waving the chairman's
teachings. The response was not what we expected. Nearly to a
person, our Irish panel wondered what all the fuss was about.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce, they said in various ways, wrote winningly and acutely
about a city. He also brought more international attention to
Dublin from the world's culturati than anyone they could think of.
Still, from their point of view, he was just one more Irish writer
describing parochial concerns shared by all of them.
</P>
<P>
   We who had read the text, texts about the text, Freudian
interpretations of the text and various parsings of classical
references to the text, were taken aback by such casualness. For
these were all brilliant people, as either writers or literary
scholars or both.
</P>
<P>
   If some of us were disappointed, time has made their attitude
clearer. Indeed, the world may have made more of this book because
it saw it from a distance. Having to invent our own details, to
translate Joyce's descriptions into our own vocabulary of sights
and sounds, allowed the supposed grandness of Joyce's themes a
certain room to breathe and spread out over our field of vision.
</P>
<P>
   Profundity profits from a little distance. Imagining a Cormac
McCarthy cowboy from the printed page, the reader proceeds
naturally from the particular to the general. It is another matter
when we are standing next to the flesh-and-blood source of
McCarthy's cosmic speculations.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing past the smell of horses, cigarettes and Lone Star beer
is not easy when we are surrounded by sheer physicality. This is
what probably happened to our Irish writers. In ``Ulysses,'' they
saw what they knew and not much else.
</P>
<P>
   My complaints about ``A Streetcar Named Desire'' have a lot to
do with Graham's view of Southerners. Indeed, I think he has turned
Williams' play into ``Madama Butterfly'' with Spanish moss. It is
not the first time an opera figure has nailed in a Southern
setting. Remember Puccini, careful geographer that he was, who set
the finale of ``Manon Lescaut'' in a ``desert near New Orleans.''
</P>
<P>
   Southerners do not behave as Graham would have them do,
especially Blanche DuBois, the faded belle of Williams' dreams.
Blanche is a type known and dreaded by most Southern men.
Self-deluding and self-destructive, she manipulates the men around
her to selfish ends, often by preying on their guilt feelings. She
drinks too much (or just enough, depending on your point of view).
I see a lot of my own mother in her, and the mothers of many of my
childhood acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   But Blanche is not Blanche unless her willful doings emanate
from a basic dignity and outer quietude. Graham, I fear, has spent
too much time directing Italian operas, and so he sends Renee
Fleming, for whom Previn wrote the part, through the usual operatic
repertory of staggers, grimaces, hand-wringings, head-holdings and
semaphoric waving of arms.
</P>
<P>
   Southerners do not act this way, but would probably get in a lot
less trouble if they did. They can't purge their feelings on the
spot; they wait until they are out of control.
</P>
<P>
   This is a real problem for opera directors, for how is one to
keep the stage busy and the audience engaged when everyone stands
around and smolders? There are no Scarpias in ``A Streetcar Named
Desire,'' no Violettas, no Santuzzas.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Southern formula for meltdown begins with the long fuse and
ends with the mega-explosion. This is why Italian households can be
loud but are rarely a threat to one's physical safety. Southern
families, on the other hand, tend to be quiet and lethal. Mitch's
eruptions at the end of the opera are compromised by exaggerating
him everywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Like Wozzeck, he is clumsy, taciturn and passive, that is until
events become too pressing for him. Anthony Dean Griffey sings the
part beautifully, but he has been made into something of a boob.
Without his original dignity, Mitch has little potency.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Opera evidently brought in a drawl expert to
set Southern diction in the proper place, but in the process
someone seems to have forgotten that Southern accents are various
and, as in British culture, go a long way toward indicating class
and social status.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Kowalski and friends are pretty much dead-on. Stella, as
played by Elizabeth Futral, is blessedly neutral. Ms. Fleming, on
the other hand, has been led in the wrong direction. The Civil War
was being felt in the South as late as the 1930s and '40s, and one
of its manifestations was that poverty and gentility were not
mutually exclusive.
</P>
<P>
   A family financially ruined by Reconstruction could still
command great respect, something that made accent an important
badge of aristocracy. Blanche certainly circles this milieu. Having
her enunciate in wavering trailer-trash diphthongs was not helpful.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think Previn, Graham or Ms. Fleming have any idea who
Blanche DuBois is or where she comes from. It may not bother them,
but it bothers me. Yet wasn't it Turgenev who wrote that fictional
characters pale next to the most mundane life actually lived? On
the other hand, fictional characters let us hold on to bigger
ideas. Real people lock us into the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the point of this operatic exercise is not to be faithful
to Tennessee Williams' South or my South, but just to be opera,
just to carry on a tradition that developed in Italy first as bel
canto and then verismo, and now has come to New Orleans. Previn
created his role of Blanche especially for Ms. Fleming. The vocal
lines are graceful, and she sings them beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   Opera has always been about beautiful singing anyway, not about
sociological correctness. What does it matter whether Ms. Fleming's
wholesome-sounding soprano has little to do with Blanche at all. It
certainly doesn't matter in ``I Puritani.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Streetcar Named Desire'' is an opera that people who don't
know much about the South will probably get more out of than those
who do. That may end up being its strength, although you will never
prove it by me. Like my Irish writers, I have seen too much for my
own good.

FINES LEVIED FOR ILLEGAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO DOLE CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE STEPHENS  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) A Las Vegas executive and his company have paid
$160,000 in fines for funneling illegal contributions to Bob Dole's
1996 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The payments and a guilty plea by the executive come two years
after The Kansas City Star uncovered the scheme at DeLuca Liquor &AMP;
Wine Ltd., one of Nevada's largest liquor wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   The Star reported in 1996 that Ray Norvell, vice president in
charge at DeLuca, supplied thousands of dollars to his workers and
their families. They then wrote individual checks to the Dole
campaign, evading a ban on corporate contributions and a $1,000 cap
on individual donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray Norvell did not know he was doing anything wrong,'' his
lawyer, Ken Gross, said Tuesday. ``But he has come to this
resolution to put the matter behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   In a plea agreement, Norvell acknowledged using the scheme to
funnel $10,000 into the Dole campaign. He pleaded guilty to one
count of making an illegal campaign contribution and one count of
using the name of another person to make a contribution. Both
charges are misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   Norvell paid a $100,000 criminal fine and a $10,000 civil fine
to the Federal Election Commission. His company paid $50,000 to the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   In return, prosecutors agreed not to file criminal charges
against the corporation. DeLuca is controlled by the William Wirtz
family of Chicago, whose half-billion-dollar business empire
includes the Blackhawks hockey team.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview two years ago, Norvell said he gave his
employees $5,000 each to use for political contributions, and they
were free to contribute the money to whomever they liked. Although
that arrangement would have been illegal, a resulting U.S. Senate
investigation concluded Norvell's true actions were an even more
clear violation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Documents indicate that those employees who contributed to the
Dole campaign were given money specifically for those donations and
not as part of some general `contribution allowance,' '' the Senate
governmental affairs committee said in a report issued earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The corporate payment stub attached to the check for Norvell
actually included the notation `Campaign - Dole.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The committee found no evidence that Dole or his staff knew of
the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Norvell told The Star in 1996 that he engineered the arrangement
so his company could participate in a major fund-raising reception
spearheaded by Las Vegas casinos. The event generated $477,000 in
donations for Dole's campaign, most of it in $1,000 checks from
individual casino workers.
</P>
<P>
   Norvell said the money was given to fight a short-lived plan by
the Clinton administration to levy a 4 percent tax on gambling
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Norvell did not respond to phone messages Tuesday. Dole also
could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Boston multimillionaire Simon Fireman pleaded guilty to
masterminding a similar scheme, also uncovered by The Star.
Fireman, a vice chairman of Dole's campaign, pleaded guilty to
felony charges and was sentenced to six months of home confinement.
Two of his associates pleaded guilty, too.
</P>
<P>
   Fireman and his company, Aqua-Leisure Industries, paid fines
totaling $6 million _ 10 times the previous record in a campaign
case.
</P>
<P>
   In August, a subsidiary of Sun-Diamond Growers pleaded guilty to
making illegal contributions to Dole's political action committee
in 1993 and to the Bush-Quayle presidential campaign. The
California company was assessed $480,000 in fines and civil
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The company acknowledged that it used stipends paid to outside
directors to make $37,000 in illegal campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said the company paid $2,500 to each of
its 16 directors who were not part of company management in both
1992 and 1993, and suggested contributions to the Bush and Dole
committees.

KICK-STARTING (KAPOW!) A TV SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (cb) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The broadcast networks have spent 50 years
perfecting one of the most regimented and costly creative processes
in the arts, producing new fall series. Script ideas are pitched en
masse by October, 11 months before the new season; some 300 full
scripts are then delivered by Christmas. In January, 100 or so are
selected for filming as pilots, usually in March; the pilots are
delivered by May 1, and in mid-May maybe 35 shows win coveted spots
on the new schedule, presumably the best of the best.
</P>
<P>
   Now forget all that. In a television world turned upside down by
cable and changing viewing habits, ``Martial Law,'' on CBS, is
possibly the most unusual, and revealing, new show. It was given
the nod before there was even a script, thrown together in seven
weeks and approved without shooting a full-fledged pilot. And it
stars a Hong Kong movie director who speaks broken English and has
not done much acting in years.
</P>
<P>
   The show is an oddity that illustrates what many experts say is
the increasingly vulnerable Achilles heel of television in this
ultra-competitive era: the chaotic state of programming. The
networks have never spent more to put on shows that attracted fewer
viewers or failed with greater frequency. Occasionally, that
results in desperate efforts to strike pay dirt by breaking out of
the old regimen.
</P>
<P>
   So imagine, if you will, someone like the heavyset Lieutenant
Sipowicz of ``NYPD Blue'' spinning from the roofs of cars onto the
chests of criminals like an overweight Jackie Chan, thrashing a
towering rival with a chalk eraser while spouting aphorisms on how
imagination forms the soul of warfare. Throw in an episode in which
the kung fu hero wins some patio furniture on ``The Price Is
Right,'' and you have ``Martial Law,'' which will have its premiere
on Saturday night at 9 Eastern time.
</P>
<P>
   It stars Sammo Hung as a Chinese cop who teams up with some
American detectives to hunt Lee Hei, his nemesis, in the Los
Angeles underworld. The idea was to produce a martial arts series
for prime time. But Hung, 44, who is a skilled martial arts expert,
is no lithe Bruce Lee; he is 5 foot 7 and weighs 220 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   More than just a genre-bending sendup, ``Martial Law'' reflects
the lengths to which CBS is willing to go to win back some of the
young male viewers who have mostly fled to other channels. CBS
executives decided to abandon their normal development process and
broadcast the show shortly after agreeing to spend several billion
dollars to regain the rights to broadcast National Football League
games, also part of the effort to woo this audience.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS Television, said that since
the network's loss of football several years ago, its audience had
become about 60 percent female, which is considered a liability.
``The proportion was way out of whack,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By casting off its image as the network for an older, more
sedate and earnest crowd (``Martial Law'' essentially replaces
``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman''), CBS hopes to attract the affluent
male channel flippers advertisers covet. Indeed, ``Dr. Quinn'' had
scored a mediocre 7.7 overall rating for the past season, but a
weak 1.7 for men aged 18 to 34. (Each rating point represents
994,000 homes.)
</P>
<P>
   Increasing the proportion of young male viewers can translate
into dollars and cents. According to Advertising Age, the trade
publication, CBS' average 30-second commercial sells for $129,000,
lowest among the four major networks and well behind the leader,
NBC, which commands a reported $168,000.
</P>
<P>
   The story behind ``Martial Law,'' many people in the television
industry said, demonstrates that the old process of creating shows
has all but collapsed, particularly since there are now six
broadcast networks, not just three, and numerous cable channels are
developing original programming and vying for the same viewers.
</P>
<P>
   These days, shows are pulled after being shown just a few times
if ratings are poor, and many executives complain that there are
simply not enough good writers and actors to fill so many time
slots with high-quality material. Just 6 of the 37 shows introduced
last fall are back, compared with 17 the previous year, and critics
are already busy panning the latest slate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that all six networks are going at this in the same
way at the same time makes it incredibly difficult,'' said Sandy
Grushow, the president of 20th Century Fox Television, which is
involved in the production of ``Martial Law.'' ``I think what
you're seeing is a dilution of the talent, and there's been a
dilution of the overall quality of the programming.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, ``Martial Law'' and its quirky mix of comedy and
chop-socky action has been noticed by critics. Entertainment Weekly
went so far as to conclude, ``The oddly appealing show has cult
breakout written all over it (in pencil at least).''
</P>
<P>
   The seed for the series was planted last March when Terry
Botwick, a senior vice president at CBS, sat next to his lawyer,
Ernie Del, at a Los Angeles dinner party. Botwick told Del that for
some time he had been thinking of introducing a martial arts drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't believe this, but I may have had a drink with your
guys last night,'' Del replied. ``But I guess it's too late'' for
the coming season.
</P>
<P>
   Botwick said he was intrigued, and Del explained that he had
spoken the previous evening with Andre Morgan, a veteran of Hong
Kong martial arts films, and that he and a partner, Stanley Tong,
were interested in a humorous kung fu show for television. Tong,
who was originally trained as a stuntman in Hong Kong, has directed
several Jackie Chan films, including ``Rumble in the Bronx'' and
``First Strike.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's not too late,'' Botwick said. The next day, Del met
with Moonves, Botwick and other executives to discuss the idea. (As
it happens, one of Del's partners at his firm, Del, Shaw, Blye and
Moonves, is Moonves' younger brother. In addition, Del and Leslie
Moonves are best friends.)
</P>
<P>
   Moonves jumped at the proposal, even though it meant the show
would leapfrog at least one series that had been in development,
``Texarkana,'' a small-town police drama. But CBS was eager to
appeal to the same sort of audience that tuned in loyally to
another Saturday evening action show, ``Walker, Texas Ranger,''
with Chuck Norris, also a martial arts expert.

 LOS ANGELES: also a martial arts expert. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``There was a development process, if you can call writing a
script in less than a week a development process,'' said Grushow of
20th Century Fox Television.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first steps was to recruit a writer-producer who
could not only develop a script but begin casting and other
preparations. Moonves asked if Carlton Cuse was available. Cuse is
a Harvard-educated producer who created ``Nash Bridges,'' a CBS
drama that stars Don Johnson. Del is Cuse's lawyer, too.
</P>
<P>
   Cuse recalled that all of his children's passports were on the
desk in front of him for a long-planned vacation, when the phone
rang. ``I was mentally halfway to Costa Rica at that point,'' he
said. ``He asked whether I was interested in getting involved in a
martial arts show for CBS. I asked if this was for next year, and
he said no, it had to be ready in May.''
</P>
<P>
   By the third week of March, the deal had been struck and the
contracts signed. Cuse started writing on his 39th birthday, March
22. ``I literally locked myself in a room for five days,'' he said.
``I told them there's no time for a full pilot. I had already done
the counting of the days and realized we had just nine shooting
days. Normally you'd have 15 at least.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``All I knew really was that it would be a Chinese cop
in L.A., a fish out of water kind of story.''
</P>
<P>
   The first major problem was finding a star. Cuse said the
producers tried to sign Jackie Chan, who combines the elements of
humor and action they were seeking. But he was not available on
such short notice.
</P>
<P>
   After some discussions, they decided to talk with Hung, who grew
up with Chan and knows Tong. Among other things, Hung directed Chan
in ``Mr. Nice Guy,'' but he had a colorful past in Hong Kong's
cinema. He had performed in a classic kung fu battle in the Bruce
Lee movie ``Enter the Dragon.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hung had an eye for comedy. He later starred in a film
called ``Enter the Fat Dragon.'' He also helped initiate a new
genre, horror kung fu, with ``Encounters of the Spooky Kind.''
</P>
<P>
   The producers reached Hung on a golf course in China and
discussed the idea. ``He doesn't exactly look like Tom Selleck,''
said Cuse. ``The obvious choice was someone more in the Bruce Lee
school. But he really knows the moves, and he is good at comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   (In the first episode, Dana, a Los Angeles detective, first sees
Hung's character after he gets mugged. She mutters: ``The guy we're
looking for is a martial arts expert. That guy looks like a
cook.'')
</P>
<P>
   It took a while to persuade Hung, particularly because of the
rigorous schedule. Hung, who now divides his time between Hong Kong
and Los Angeles, said: ``I had never thought about acting in a TV
series in America. One problem is that this is in English. My
English is not very good. I'm Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   Shooting began on April 22.
</P>
<P>
   Problems cropped up immediately. Martial arts scenes can take a
long time to choreograph and set up, and they require skilled stunt
coordinators and doubles. But Hung's usual stunt coordinator was
unable to obtain his visa in time and was stuck in Hong Kong. And
Hung's double, a martial arts instructor from San Jose, Calif.,
injured himself in training, which meant Hung, called Sammo Law in
the show, had to do everything himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought, `Oh God, if Sammo goes down we're dead,' ''
said Cuse.
</P>
<P>
   There was also the problem of casting the other lead parts, two
officers, a man and a woman. ``By this point, the talent pool was
really sucked dry,'' said Cuse. ``Every drama pilot had been cast.
It was a very difficult process, and Les is very particular about
casting.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the actors selected had some connection to CBS. Tammy
Lauren, a former child actress who had appeared on ``Walker, Texas
Ranger'' and has studied martial arts, was the female lead, Dana.
For the male lead, the producers initially borrowed Dale Midkiff, a
journeyman actor, from ``The Magnificent Seven,'' a CBS show whose
fate was uncertain. He shot the first ``Martial Law'' film, but
when his show got a slot on CBS's schedule, he was replaced by
Louis Mandylor, an Australian who had been a kick boxer before
moving to acting and an occasional part on ``Nash Bridges'' as a
small-time hood, Ray Goetz.
</P>
<P>
   The filming took just days. The editing and post-production work
had to be compressed into eight days; normally it takes about 22
days, Cuse said.
</P>
<P>
   A so-called presentation episode _ a 28-minute sample rather
than a full pilot _ was delivered on May 10. On May 20, CBS
announced that ``Martial Law'' would be on its schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Making the show required trampling on just about every rule of
production. As Hung's character says in the first episode, ``You
don't break rocks with eggs.''

`SPORTS NIGHT' BREAKS ALL THE RULES _ AND IS THE BETTER FOR IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps because he has never stepped into the TV sitcom grinder,
screenwriter Adam Sorkin (''An American President'') doesn't seem
to possess any preconceptions of how a comedy series should look,
sound or behave. The result, ``Sports Night,'' is a different kind
of comedy for a different kind of audience that could _ who knows?
_ ignite a different kind of TV era.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the offices and studio of a nightly cable program
(modeled after ESPN's Sports Center), ``Sports Night'' features a
young, talented and relatively unknown ensemble (except for
journeyman Robert Guilliame, wisely cast as the authoritative
station head), as well as a script written completely unlike those
that come from the cookie-cutter factory where most writers produce
their stories and stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   Co-anchors are Casey (Peter Krause) and Dan (Josh Charles),
likable, good-looking chaps, mid-30s, passionate and, of course,
socially challenged. Dan is a wide-eyed single; an impending
divorce is driving Casey mad.
</P>
<P>
   Guilliame's Isaac Jaffee oversees the production of this crew,
lurking about as the stern taskmaster with a firm, fair heart. Part
mother hen, part teacher, Isaac looks out for their backs and
climbs on them when they need it.
</P>
<P>
   Although Isaac understands the ratings significance of his
lively anchors, his favorite appears to be hotshot producer Dana
(Felicity Huffman). Harried and even-tempered, she is the brain
food of the operation, a producer who rarely stops moving or
directing, even in her personal life.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Sports Night'' pilot has the production values of an
hourlong drama and the pacing of a more serious serial. Its texture
is realistic, its tensions chaotic, its situations rarely forced,
except for a manipulative gushy ending that supposedly restores
Casey's love for the humanity of sports.
</P>
<P>
   My fear is that no one will get what Sorkin and his producers
are trying to do. We've become so conditioned to accept sitcoms in
familiar packages that the first time people try to break out of
the mold, they're crucified. All we can hope is that ``Ally
McBeal'' has softened the way a bit when it comes to ``dramadies,''
those series that are neither pure comedy nor pure drama.
</P>
<P>
   If there's a comparison, HBO's ``The Larry Sanders Show'' would
fit, although in pitting them side by side, one thing ``Sports
Night'' lacks is the kind of comedic cynicism that made ``Sanders''
such a hoot. Upping its laugh quotient wouldn't hurt, either.
(Speaking of which ... what will undoubtedly hurt ``Sports Night''
is the annoying laugh track, which creator Sorkin wanted to leave
on the cutting-room floor but ABC insisted on.)
</P>
<P>
   Oh well. Everything's a trade-off. Guess this would be the sound
of the newly minted TV producer beginning his journey through the
grinder.  &QR;

 By JACK ANDERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The autumn season at the Joyce Theater got off to a
fine start on Tuesday night with a rousing performance by the
Dayton Contemporary Dance Company. Since Jeraldyne Blunden, its
director, founded it 30 years ago, it has grown steadily in skill
and assurance. It now lives confidently in the present and looks
proudly back on dance's past.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Blunden has assembled a wide repertory and has offered many
premieres. She has also paid her respects to history by reviving
significant modern-dance works, especially ones by important black
choreographers. Two came to life at the Joyce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Awassa Astrige/Ostrich'' was a solo choreographed in 1932 by
Asadata Dafora, a dancer from Sierra Leone who, in addition to
staging original productions, helped introduce traditional African
dance forms to New York. In this fascinating piece, to recorded
music by Carl Riley, the choreography transformed G.D. Harris into
a powerful bird. Stalking about the stage, Harris was a commanding
and slightly sinister presence. Cartoons and comic strips often
make ostriches ridiculous. But one instantly knew that this dancing
ostrich was a wild creature who could put up a fierce fight if
attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Restless energy of another sort was evident in ``Prologue and
Toccata,'' an excerpt from ``Come and Get the Beauty of It Hot,'' a
long jazz suite that Talley Beatty choreographed in 1960. The
dancers were first glimpsed clustered nervously together in a
huddle. Then individuals broke loose and kept crossing the stage so
often that it was difficult to remember that there were only 10
people in the cast. Their comings and goings, to recordings by
Charles Mingus and Dizzy Gillespie, were always vigorous. They were
tense, as well. The work evoked a busy city that could be
threatening as well as exciting.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Ward, an associate artistic director and resident
choreographer of the company, dedicated his ``Offering'' to James
Truitte, a respected dancer and teacher who was associated with
many groups, Alvin Ailey's among them, and who served as master
teacher in residence for the Dayton dancers from 1975 until his
death in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   A photographic exhibition celebrating Truitte's achievements is
on view through Monday at the New School. Ward honored Truitte with
a choreographic hymn to life, performed to music of Glazounov and
Delius. Sheri Williams seemed a personification of the life force
as she moved faster and faster with mounting abandon. Running steps
for Maria Berman and DeShona Pepper symbolized youthful longings.
Sequences in which Alvin Rangel, David Reuille, Terence Greene and
Harris supported one another became signs of ways in which
vulnerable human beings can care for one another. ``Offering'' was
a tribute both to a man and to the expressive power of dance.
</P>
<P>
   Two other dances emphasized patterns. Donald Byrd filled his
``Dark Joy,'' to music by Mio Morales, with thrusting arms and
kicking legs and kept contrasting solos and duets with ensembles.
The pace eventually became a bit too relentless. But Sharon Leahy's
``Reach'' grew increasingly exhilarating as simple walking patterns
to a score by Rick Good developed into outbursts of stamping,
clapping, leaping and spinning. ``Reach'' brought the evening to a
giddy conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton company remains through Sunday night at the Joyce
Theater, 175 Eighth Ave., at 19th Street.

BUS (Phoenix) - The Phoenix area's bus system, already considered
to be inadequate, is now suggesting that riders consider some other
means of transportation _ or stay away from the bus system during
its busiest hours. Anticipating that newer, but smaller, buses will
lead to overcrowding during rush hours, transit officials are
warning riders to expect standing room only. In some cases, they're
even suggesting people might want to drive, rather than endure
crowds. By MARY JO PITZL. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
GERMAN-ELECTION (Bonn) - ``It's the economy, dummkopf!'' The
rakishly charming Gerard Schroder adopts a Clintonesque economic
platform to challenge Germany's aging Ronald Reagan, Helmut Kohl.
By JERRY KAMMER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MOTOROLA-CONTRACT (Scottsdale, Ariz.) - Motorola's communications
division in Scottsdale announced Wednesday that it has won a
contract with the Navy worth up to $337 million for its radio
described as a ``computer at your fingertips.'' The magic is that
it's reprogramable, like a computer, so it can be modified to send
either voice, data and video. And the portable radio works with all
existing military radios. By REBECCA ROLWING. Story will move in
the ``F'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MOTOROLA-SEVERANCE - Arizona's largest private employer is offering
many of its workers a chance at a voluntary severance package
before it sets in with layoffs. All employees in Motorola's
Semiconductor Products Sector, which employs nearly 13,000 in the
Valley of the Sun (Phoenix area), received a 10-page e-mail this
week detailing the offer, and for the first time, what options they
would face if they chose not to take it. By LISA GONDERINGER. Story
will move in the ``F'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) - At 11:30 a.m. Wednesday, I decided to
drive to Pittsburgh, Pa., for lunch. I usually don't go out to eat
that early, but I needed to get back to the office by midafternoon.
There is home, and there is back home. One is where you are, the
other is where you are from. The best part of living in Phoenix is
that you get to have it both ways. By E.J. MONTINI. Story will move
in the ``A'' and ``K'' categories. &QL; 
 &QL; 
NOTARO-COLUMN (Undated) - Ever since my husband and I had started a
high-protein, no-carbohydrate diet two weeks before, we had eaten
more meat than the entire Clan of the Cave Bear in one hunting
season. We learned about the diet from our friends, Jon and Kevin,
who had lost an amazing amount of weight in just two weeks by
cutting out bread and sugar from their meals. It sounded like a
dream. Eat all the cheese, butter, cream and meat you want, and
watch the pounds drop from your butt like fleas off a hairless dog.
It wasn't painless. By LAURI NOTARO. Story moved in the ``L''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
WIFFLEBALL (Undated) - Boston Red Sox legend Ted Williams once said
that hitting a baseball was the hardest thing to do in sports.
Maybe Williams never tried hitting a Wiffle ball. Yard Ball is a
four-on-four Wiffle ball tournament sponsored by Major League
Baseball which is traveling to ten cities this year with hopes of
expanding to all 30 Major League cities in two years. BY KEVIN
MURPHY. Story moved in the ``L'' and ``S`` categories. &QL;

FORGIVENESS FOR HARVARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1998 The Bston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his late autumn of official power, Nelson Mandela was as deft
with Harvard University as he was in prison and moved only by two
decades of student protests to a limited and grumpy form of
divestment from the apartheid regime.
</P>
<P>
   No, Mandela looked out at the crowd of 25,000 people at
Harvard's Tercentenary Theater. Out there was the real reason he
needed to accept this degree. Way off the stage of dignitaries and
professors in regalia were his true believers.
</P>
<P>
   There were many former student protesters and members of the
Free South Africa movement that made Krugerrands a radioactive
currency in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   There were teachers, businesspeople, local politicians, writers,
musicians, and municipal workers, who piece by piece educated
students and colleagues so well about the racist brutality of the
old South Africa that divestment was debated in city and state
governments and all the way up to the pro-apartheid Reagan
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, because of the 5,000 tickets Harvard made
available to the public, there were hundreds of children who needed
to be encouraged that true presidential leadership can exist, as
opposed to the kind that has made oral sex the talk of the grade
school playground.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela lifted the massive degree above his head so he and the
degree seemed 10 feet tall. Only two other individuals had ever
been given an honorary doctorate outside of commencement: George
Washington and Winston Churchill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It holds great symbolic significance to the mind and to the
future memory of this great American institution; the name of an
African is now added to those two illustrious leaders of the
Western world,'' Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
   Applause roared back. It no longer mattered if Harvard president
Neil Rudenstine could not find a humble moment to acknowledge that
Harvard's investment policies ran counter to the wishes of the
antiapartheid struggle.
</P>
<P>
   What mattered was that Mandela's principles and stature forced
Harvard to genuflect toward him. What will go down on paper as a
presentation by Harvard to Mandela will linger in the spirit as
Mandela graciously _ through his silence on the matter _ granted
Harvard absolution.
</P>
<P>
   This is no different from what Mandela has done in South Africa.
Most people know in general about the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, which has granted immunity to the enforcers of
apartheid in exchange for a full rendering of history.
</P>
<P>
   To understand Mandela's principles one must go back to the
moment in 1985 that he decided to enter secret negotiations with
the apartheid regime, so secret that not even Mandela's own
colleagues in the African National Congress knew.
</P>
<P>
   The moment came only months after Mandela refused an offer from
Prime Minister P.W. Botha to be released. Botha had demanded that
Mandela renounce violence. In a public letter, Mandela responded to
Botha: ``Let him renounce violence. Let him say he will dismantle
apartheid.... Only free men can negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandela, free in his own mind, began negotiations anyway after
his jailers isolated him without notice from other political
prisoners in Pollsmoor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not happy to be separated from my colleagues,'' Mandela
wrote in ``Long Walk to Freedom,'' his autobiography. ``But my
solitude gave me a certain liberty, and I resolved to use it to do
something I had been pondering for a long while: begin discussions
with the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we did not start a dialogue soon, both sides would be
plunged into a dark night of oppression, violence, and war. My
solitude would give me an opportunity to take the first steps in
that direction without the kind of scrutiny that might destroy such
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been fighting against white minority rule for
three-quarters of a century. We had been engaged in the armed
struggle for more than two decades. Many people on both sides had
already died. The enemy was strong and resolute. Yet even with all
their bombers and tanks, they must have sensed they were on the
wrong side of history. We had right on our side, but not yet might.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear to me that a military victory was a distant if
not impossible dream. It simply did not make sense for both sides
to lose thousands if not millions of lives in a conflict that was
unnecessary. They must have known this as well. It was time to
talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone from our side needed to take the first step, and my
new isolation gave me both the freedom to do so and the assurance,
at least for a while, of the confidentiality of my efforts....
There are times when a leader must move out ahead of the flock, go
off in a new direction, confident that he is leading his people the
right way.''

MOVEMENTS PLOT ESCAPE FROM LA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The draw of the address is not what it once was.
</P>
<P>
   Synonymous with smog, associated with scandal, the City of
Angels has become a city to escape, even by residents who have no
intention of moving. Their aim is to break off entire
neighborhoods, in a series of secessions that, if successful, could
bump Los Angeles out of its berth as the nation's second-largest
city _ its population currently exceeded only by New York City. It
wouldn't even be California's largest city anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The new top spot would belong to the San Fernando Valley, where
petitions calling for a state-mandated study toward becoming a
separate city are expected to be handed in at month's end. With a
population of more than 1.2 million, the Valley stands to become
the sixth-largest city in the country, responsible for its own
schools and other services such as street repair and garbage
collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say we're going to break up a great city, but a great
city is not measured in terms of population or geographic size,''
said Jeff Brain, a commercial real estate broker who is president
of Valley Voters Organized Toward Empowerment, or Valley Vote.
``It's measured by the quality of life and people's ability to get
the services they need when they need them.''
</P>
<P>
   With at least neighborhoods considering secession, Los Angeles
could lose up to 60 percent of its population to a smattering of
new cities. From Westchester near Los Angeles International Airport
to tiny Eagle Rock in the city's northeast corner to the waterfront
suburb of San Pedro, proponents of secession say local control can
only improve the spotty police, sanitation, and other services they
now get from the city.
</P>
<P>
   The sprawl of the city, spread over 460-plus square miles, as
well as its costly and cumbersome bureaucracy, make no sense for
the next millennium, they argue. Even a small group on the
relatively affluent and well-tended West Side wants to secede and
then reestablish itself as the City of West Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be a piece of cake,'' said David Tuttle, an
urban planner and medical writer who helped found the Westside
Cityhood Coalition, which hopes to start gathering signatures for a
secession study this fall. ``But the city of West LA can happen.
This is our only real-world option.''
</P>
<P>
   Their efforts, some fledgling, some well under way, are part of
a national trend toward decentralization that includes
secessionists, anti-annexationists, and residents pushing for
incorporation. Howard Husock, director of case studies and public
policy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, calls those
efforts ``pro-government,'' saying people in fact want to create
more government, only closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``As opposed to saying, `Let's get government off our backs,'
these people are saying they want their own governments on their
backs ...,'' said Husock, who has studied the Valley secession plan
and concluded that it can and should happen. ``If the Valley
succeeds, it would be a signal movement that set up similar
situations across the country. If Los Angeles broke up, that would
be a really big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some secession opponents concede that LA is a city whose
sense of civic identity is nearly as loose as its population is
vast _ greater than half the states in the nation. Among them is
Mayor Richard Riordan, who says Los Angeles is more than the sum of
its parts, and that splintering it would cost the city clout.
Riordan favors reforming the city charter in ways that he says
would enhance responsiveness and keep the city government
accountable to its 3.4 million residents. As mayoral spokesman
Deane Leavenworth put it, ``The mayor feels the best way to deal
with these issues is to fix the city, not to break it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Only weeks ago, the Valley's chance to break away from Los
Angeles appeared uncertain, putting the fate of the entire
secession movement in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   While Valley Vote had gathered enough signatures to initiate a
mandatory secession study, the numbers left no cushion against
possibly invalid names. So Governor Pete Wilson gave the group more
time _ the second time he has given the movement impetus. Last
October, he signed a bill that scrapped the City Council's veto
power over secession and made it easier for residents fed up with
municipal governments to split off and form new cities.
</P>
<P>
   Now city voters are free to determine what constitutes their
city. First, though, the state's Local Agency Formation Commission
must study Valley secession and decide whether to allow a citywide
vote at all. Any split must be revenue-neutral, and proposed cities
must prove they won't sink financially.
</P>
<P>
   Activists, collectively called the Alliance for
Self-Determination, say they hope to see secession on the 2000
ballot _ leaving them about two years to overcome what even
proponents call voter apathy on the issue. It will take a majority
vote in a citywide election for any of the secession efforts to
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our successes are interlinked, because we need the
votes of people in Hollywood, in the Valley, on the West Side, just
like they need ours,'' said Rex Frankel, a plumber and newspaper
publisher who heads the Westchester/Ballona Cityhood Committee.
``Before, only the affected communities had to vote on it, but at
least now the city can't just veto us. That changes the dynamics of
everything. It means it could really happen.''
</P>
<P>
   At the least, secession activists have gotten City Hall's
attention. Brain, of Valley Vote, says city government has become
more attentive to resident concerns, paving streets faster and
patrolling neighborhoods more regularly. He also gives the movement
credit for charter reform, saying the impetus was to avoid breaking
apart the city itself.
</P>
<P>
   Even Erwin Chemerinsky, a University of Southern California law
professor who is chairman of the elected Charter Reform Commission,
says secessionists have a right to be angry over how council and
other political districts were drawn. Los Angeles has 15 council
members, or one for every 250,000 residents, making it all but
impossible, activists say, to get a face-to-face appointment to air
a grievance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think this will be solved by electing someone else;
the sheer size of the territory our councilman has is too much,''
said Pam Probst, an activist who hopes to see Eagle Rock
incorporated as a city of 28,000. ``We would just like to take over
our own community ourselves. We have the right to do that, and
that's what we want to do.''

TALKS ON DISARMING IRA FAIL TO REACH COMPROMISE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland and Mo
Mowlam, the highest British official in Northern Ireland, tried but
failed Wednesday to devise a compromise in the growing dispute over
disarming the Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   After an 80-minute meeting Wednesday morning, Ahern and Mowlam,
the Northern Ireland secretary, said they were making progress on a
number of other issues, however.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days the disarmament dispute has accelerated, creating
a sense of growing crisis as officials work to carry out the
mandates of the Northern Ireland peace agreement reached in the
spring.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA has observed a cease-fire for 14 months, but has
repeatedly said it will not give up its arsenal, which is estimated
at 100 tons of weapons, including explosives. That has led to
problems for its political wing, Sinn Fein, whose members are
seeking important posts in the new Northern Ireland Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Mowlam said she was sure that the IRA would eventually disarm.
But other officials pointed out that she declined to address the
pivotal point of the dispute, exactly when disarmament might begin.
</P>
<P>
   Ahern told Mowlam that the announcement on Tuesday that Britain
was withdrawing 500 of its 17,500 troops in the North was helpful.
Officials and experts said the prime minister meant the withdrawal
to be seen as a concession to the IRA and Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night Ahern and the first minister of the new
Northern Ireland Assembly, David Trimble, called on the IRA to say
when it might begin to disarm and asked Sinn Fein to try to find
out.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Tuesday, Trimble met with Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein
president. Adams' position has been that disarmament would come
only as part of an overall enactment of the political provisions of
the new peace accord that is to give Roman Catholics added power in
the predominantly Protestant British province.
</P>
<P>
   All requirements of the peace agreement have to be carried out
by May 2000, and Sinn Fein has indicated that it will not disarm
before then.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere became tenser Wednesday afternoon as Trimble and
Adams, who had been cooperating in private meetings in recent
weeks, accused each other of reneging on the provisions of the
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The disarmament issue has repeatedly impeded efforts to make
peace between the province's Protestants and its Catholic minority.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly, which is to take over many of the government
functions that London controls, is scheduled to set up a
provisional cabinet that will take part in a new cross-border
agency, the North-South Ministerial Council, made up of northern
Catholics and Protestants and members from the Irish Republic. But
the process has been stalled over IRA disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein insists that it now has to be given two ministerial
posts in the cabinet under the rules of the peace accord. But
Protestant Unionists, led by Trimble, insist that the IRA has to
begin some form of disarmament before Sinn Fein names ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein accuses Trimble of misinterpreting the agreement and
setting a condition on cabinet membership.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement only requires all parties to work toward
disarmament in the period ending in May 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble says it is implicit in the accord that some disarmament
has to start soon, before the cabinet is filled. Adams disagrees.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The North-South Council is to meet next month. Irish officials
say that without Sinn Fein present to represent the IRA the council
will be ineffectual. The IRA policy still calls for an end to
British sovereignty in the province.
</P>
<P>
   The North-South Council was a compromise in the peace agreement
that would retain British authority but give Catholics more of a
voice.

WRITER TRIUMPHS WITH HOLOCAUST MEMOIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ The matter-of-fact way that Ruth Elias tells
her Holocaust story only magnifies the horror she endured.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Josef Mengele, whom history would remember as the ``Angel of
Death,'' was curious to know how long a newborn could survive
without food. So he had Elias's breasts taped so she couldn't feed
the daughter she had given birth to at Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   This continued for eight days, Elias told a rapt audience
gathered at the home of a Harvard professor recently, as part of an
author lecture series sponsored by the United States Holocaust
Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Her baby was dying. One afternoon, Mengele visited Elias to tell
her to be ready the next morning at 8, because he was coming to
pick up her and her newborn.
</P>
<P>
   Elias knew that could only mean one thing _ the gas chamber.
That was the usual fate of pregnant women or mothers with infants
at Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   Another female prisoner, a Jewish doctor, listened to Elias's
plight. She brought her a syringe filled with morphine and told
Elias to inject her newborn. It would kill the baby, who was
certain to die anyway, she said, and probably save Elias's life.
Elias was horrified.
</P>
<P>
   She asked the doctor to give the injection. The doctor said she
couldn't violate her physician's oath by killing a human being. It
was up to Elias.
</P>
<P>
   She agonized. She did it. She injected the morphine and her
daughter died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I killed my own child,'' Elias writes in her memoir, ``Triumph
of Hope,'' recently co-published in English by the Holocaust
Museum. ``Mengele had turned me into a child murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you at last free of this torment that has been your brief
life?'' she writes of that moment with the child in her arms. ``You
won't have to suffer anymore. Why didn't Maca bring a dose of
morphine for me, too? I want to go with you, my child. I do not
want to live.''
</P>
<P>
   The next morning Mengele came. After finding out the baby was
dead he told Elias she would be leaving Auschwitz on the next
transport. After the war, Elias, whose entire family was murdered
in the Holocaust, remarried and eventually settled in Israel. She
had two sons, who now have children of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Elias, 76, is able to talk about only the sparest details of the
death of her infant daughter. She is more effusive about how she
managed to rebuild her life and how her experience is a metaphor
for the tales of so many other Holocaust survivors _ repairing the
damage from the worst evil the world has ever known.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to psychiatrists but no textbook of psychiatry could
teach how to cure people with such trauma,'' said Elias, whose
physical vigor and youthful appearance belie her age. ``One
psychiatrist said to me: `Ruth, you have two choices. Here is a
piece of rope. Or you can choose to start all over again. I chose
to start over.''
</P>
<P>
   Elias was in Boston as part of the Holocaust Museum's efforts to
expand its mission, particularly its educational outreach, beyond
the museum walls. The museum is also trying to raise its profile in
Boston. ``It's important to remind people how important the musuem
is,'' said Boston investment banker Peter McDonald, regional
director for the museum.
</P>
<P>
   In helping to publish Elias's book in English, the museum also
is striving to ensure that the testimony of as many survivors, many
of them elderly,_ is recorded for future generations.
</P>
<P>
   Elias never intended to write a book. She and her husband had
long ago decided never to tell their sons about their past. So when
her sons would question her about the series of numbers tattooed on
her arm, Elias would change the subject or lie. ``It created a gap
between us and our children,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Elias finally changed her mind when her grandchildren arrived
and they, too, eventually asked questions such as, ``Why don't we
have any relatives to visit on the holidays?'' She wrote and cried
for several weeks. Her book was to be simply a family history for
her children and grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   But an Israeli historian acquired a copy of the manuscript,
which was written in German.Ten years ago, a German publisher
agreed to publish it. The book became a best-seller in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gap that used to be there with my children is no longer
there,'' Elias said. ``For that I am very grateful. I think that is
my biggest success. I don't think anyone who wasn't there can ever
understand what we went through. I just wanted to tell people my
story.''

   As Jews observe the high holy days, the leaders of the nation's
Reform rabbis have called for 10 days of national atonement to
reflect on the country's ethical well-being. ``The travails through
which President Clinton has taken the country may yet be redemptive
if they prompt Americans to confront the ways in which we have
given in to our baser urges, been unfaithful to our families and
others who count on us, and diverted us from the mission each of us
has been called to fulfill,'' wrote Rabbi Richard N. Levy,
president, and Rabbi Paul V. Menitoff, executive vice president of
the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the Reform rabbi
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Also weighing in on the country's current moral state of affairs
last week was Elie &UR;  &LR; Wiesel, Nobel Peace laureate and Boston
University professor. ``I've been fighting injustice my whole life,
but I don't know how to fight ugliness,'' Wiesel said in a speech
at Merrimack College in North Andover, Mass. this month where he
received the Rabin Peacemaker Award from the school's Center for
the Study of Jewish-Christian Relations. ``We live in a world where
terrifying possibilities exist and tremendous problems faces us.
And we deal with what? Pornography. Rarely have I felt such
frustration and anger as a human being and as a teacher.''

   Russia did much this decade to cast off its past, privatizing
enterprises, scrapping most price controls, and getting out of the
daily business of running the economy. Vowing not to give up on
reforms, the new prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, has urged the
world to think not of the dead weight of the planned economy, in
which nearly all private enterprise was illegal, but of the
regenerative spirit of Roosevelt's New Deal.
</P>
<P>
   But economists such as Rudiger Dornbusch of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology think instead of 1920s Weimar Germany, when
a loaf of bread cost a wheelbarrowful of marks and social tension
ushered in Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some of the old system and some of the new in
Russia,'' Dornbusch said. ``But the chances of it functioning
normally are negligible.''
</P>
<P>
   Why did Moscow choose this path? And why can't it just say no to
spending, yes to market-style change, and shape up?
</P>
<P>
   The simple and difficult answer is that things in Russia just
aren't that easy.
</P>
<P>
   This is, after all, a barter economy, where homegrown vegetables
serve as cash in the provinces and factories pay each other with
the shoddy goods they produce. Not printing money would leave
citizens and enterprises even poorer amid a collapsed ruble, as
well as potentially restless. But printing money sparks inflation,
which leads to poverty and discontent as well.
</P>
<P>
   Closing bankrupt companies would render millions jobless, adding
social instability and impoverishment to economic chaos. Not
closing them props up the whole dysfunctional mess.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, fiscal austerity urged by the International
Monetary Fund helped Moscow rein in spending and money supply
growth _ but it also kept legitimate businesses from growing. At
times, Western aid, including billions from the IMF, went no
further than elite Russian banks, which got rich on pyramid-like
schemes with government treasury bills, now largely worthless.
</P>
<P>
   The environment was good for a small group of wealthy, elite
businessmen to which the government transferred major industrial
assets under controversial schemes. But the men do not have the
cash, expertise, or power to restructure their enterprises, and
instead spend their time lobbying Kremlin corridors and seeking
opportunities to arbitrage the differences between Russian and
world commodities prices and Russian Central Bank interest rates
and inflation.
</P>
<P>
   By moving to crank up the printing presses and inject money into
the economy, Russia's new economic team thinks it can swap
vertiginous collapse for steady decline.
</P>
<P>
   It can _ for a couple of months, maybe more. But by year's end,
extra rubles will show up as hyperinflation. In the first two weeks
of September, consumer prices rose 44 percent. Many shelves stood
empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, they're not going back to Soviet-style communism, and
they're not turning their back on the world,'' said Harvard
economist Jeffrey Sachs. ``Whether they're going to chaos is
another issue.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Continuity, not change

   The economic team now in charge of a country with a population
of 147 million, half living below the poverty line, includes new
central bank head Victor Gerashchenko (who ran the bank in the late
1980s and early 1990s, printing money and fueling inflation); Yuri
Maslyukov (a moderate Communist and former Gosplan chief in the
Soviet era, now a deputy prime minister in charge of economic
policy); and Alexander Shokhin (a market-oriented centrist and
former economics minister, now in charge of finance). Many of the
men held major posts under Gorbachev, whose own perestroika reforms
were ill-defined and badly executed.
</P>
<P>
   Some key appointments are yet to be made. A coterie of
Gorbachev-era economists is offering advice but has not been
offered policy-making positions. The fate of reformers who may be
brought on board hangs in the balance, despite Primakov's pledge to
assemble a coalition Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   To many seasoned observers, that picture represents continuity,
not change.
</P>
<P>
   ``There never was a consensus in Russia on market reforms, and
there isn't one now,'' said Marshall Goldman, associate director of
Harvard's Davis Center for Russian Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is past reformers like shock-therapist Yegor Gaidar and
whiz kids Anatoly Chubais and Boris Nemtsov, all beloved by the
West, who seem the exception rather than the rule. Behind the
facade of low inflation and a stable ruble during their tenures lay
a shipwreck of an economy and a populace angered by painful
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   In opting to muddle through to the next certain crisis, Russia
is in fact doing what it has always done.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not communism; this is Chernomyrdin redux, circa
1993,'' said professor Michael McFaul of Stanford University,
referring to the inflationary, half-hearted reforms undertaken by
centrist Soviet-era manager Victor Chernomyrdin, who was prime
minister from late 1992 to mid-1998. ``Only now, the situation is
much more dire than when Chernomyrdin took over.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are other questions.
</P>
<P>
   Like Indonesia's crony capitalists and South Korea's
government-cosy chaebols, the workings of Russia's private business
circles have shattered expectations about institutions of
free-market capitalism and the extent to which policies can
generate change. Like Kremlinologists who failed to predict the
Soviet Union's demise, prominent economists who barely a year ago
resembled cheerleaders with their ``Russia! Is! A Market!
Economy!'' chant are now embarrassed and silent.
</P>
<P>
   That makes some observers wonder if Russia isn't a new breed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stabilization was supposed to generate growth and
micro-economic restructuring,'' McFaul said. ``That it did not is a
really interesting question for economists.''

 &HT;    Adman writes book critiquing industry's creations
 &HT;    By Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_Luke Sullivan has a dull office.
</P>
<P>
   A bunker with a view. Mostly blank walls in a corner of a 17th
floor in a Midtown high-rise.
</P>
<P>
   The blankness strikes you because you expect to a snazzy,
cleverly appointed office decorated with the slick, flashy
antimatter of ad campaigns. Because the guy is, after all, in
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   He's chief creative officer of WestWayne, Atlanta's largest ad
agency. And he is, to judge by the top awards he's received, one of
the best ad men in America.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the spareness, what you notice are two things: a photo of
Confederate Gen. James Longstreet (Sullivan is adescendant) and a
line drawing of a pooch doing to a Victrola what some dogs do to
chair legs (caption: ``Exciting Music Ideas'').
</P>
<P>
   Each image reveals a side of the man: Luke Sullivan, rebel with
a cause. And Luke Sullivan, crazy copywriter, yet to be neutered.
Combine the two and you have Luke Sullivan, copywriter with a
cause.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, 43, is an ad industry version of Ralph Nader who's
blowing the whistle on rotten commercials. His new book, ``Hey,
Whipple, Squeeze This'' ($16.95, John Wiley &AMP; Sons), takes
advertising to task for selling to consumers while selling them
short intellectually.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the funniest advertising book since Jerry Della
Femina's seminal 1970 ``From Those Wonderful People Who Brought You
Pearl Harbor.'' The opening two pages alone are worth the price of
admission.
</P>
<P>
   In them, Sullivan, dreams the thwarted copywriter's dream. He
dreams of murdering three mindlessly boring icons of modern
advertising: Mr. Whipple of toilet paper fame, the Ty-D-Bowl Man
and Snuggles, the fabric softening bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snuggles is easing over the back side of the basket when the
second shot takes his head off at the neck. His body lands on top
of the laundry, which is remarkably soft and fluffy.''
</P>
<P>
   The spoof is the catharsis of a copywriter who has labored 20
years trying to avoid having his work dumbed down by focus groups,
recalcitrant clients and various committees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trouble with the business,'' he says, ``is there's so much
money (involved) there are many cooks around the pot. It's the same
thing that happens in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``A writer has a great idea, but by the time it gets on the
screen, it's a far cry from what may well have been a very smart
script.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan was moved to write the book after lying awake nights
wondering why Mr. Whipple, Procter &AMP; Gamble's geezerly, bathroom
tissue-fondling spokesdweeb, was still around after a 26-year,
504-commercial run.
</P>
<P>
   The answer: Despite consumer polls that ranked Whipple as low in
believability, Whipple sold toilet paper by dint of his huge
budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason he succeeded,'' says Sullivan, ``is the amount
of money they spent airing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you send a second-grader to film a TV spot, and then air it
on prime-time TV backed by a $39 million budget, I guarantee you,
sales are going to go up, no matter how bad the spot is.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Sullivan argues, if a company is going to
spend that kind of money _ and go barging into people's living
rooms _ why not make the commercial smart and engaging?
</P>
<P>
   Americans are exposed to an average of 1,600 commercial messages
a day, he points out, so dumb ads generally fail because they're
easily ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``People not only dislike advertising,'' he says, ``they're
becoming immune to most of it _ like insects building up resistance
to DDT.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Sullivan left Minneapolis ad agency Fallon McElligott
this summer to join West/Wayne, he wrote a commercial for United
Airlines that conveys his own, and consumers', distaste for ads
that are all production and largely pointless.
</P>
<P>
   His commercial _ which comes off as a pointed jab at Delta Air
Lines' spots _ opens with a bunch of people singing and dancing on
an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   The camera pulls back and reveals a bored guy stranded at an
airport watching the scene on a TV screen. The voiceover:
``Wouldn't it be great if we could all fly commercials?''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan isn't so rebellious as to declare most advertising
stupid. Nor does he claim his cause is vital to the Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I can't stand in this business is arrogance,''
he says. ``The fact is, I'm a glorified hot dog vendor, a glorified
sign-painter.'' Still, he's happy to dispense a few rules designed
to make the next commercial break less of a mad rush to the
bathroom for American TV viewers:
</P>
<P>
   Kindly strangle the next guy who sings a jingle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jingles are a borning, corny, horrible and sad thing left over
from Eisenhower's '50s _ a time, actually, when everything was
boring, corny, horrible and sad. Avoid jingles as you would a
poisonous toad. They are death.''
</P>
<P>
   No more taglines (e.g. ``We Put the 'Qua' in Quality'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Every product in the world has one, and they change them daily
like underwear. Some of them are not bad, like 'Just Do It,' and
'Got Milk?' But, in the absence of an idea, they are hollow, big
fluffy orange circus-peanut things. If you didn't just pen 'Just Do
It,' just don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Stop with the funny radio commercials. They're killing us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many radio spots try to be funny and aren't. The long and
short of it is it's hard to be funny. Humor is the first fork in
the road taken by every copywriter in the nation on every radio job
they get. If you want to stand out in this medium, try something
other than humor.''
</P>
<P>
   You got a pun? I got a gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to being the lowest thing on the joke food chain,
puns have no persuasive value. It's OK to think them. It's OK to
write them down. Just make sure you toss them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan is not sure what impact his book will make. Already,
though, it's become a popular text at Atlanta ad school, The
Creative Circus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luke's one of the paragons of the industry both as a writer
and a mentor,'' says school President Mike Jones-Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan's own expectations are modest ``If the book just makes
one ad better,'' he says, ``it was worth writing.

 &HT;    Use imagination to concoct all kinds of combinations, because in
quesadillas. . . anything goes
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the art world, the early 20th-century painter Frida Kahlo is
revered for her unsettling self-portraits. But among her friends
and family, she was also famed for quesadillas.
</P>
<P>
   At the Blue House in Mexico City, which she shared with muralist
Diego Rivera, she would throw lavish parties where guests would
create their own cheesy treats at a banquet table set with
tortillas and filling ingredients ranging from fried pig feet to
stuffed squash blossoms.
</P>
<P>
   It's that versatility that has made quesadillas a favorite for
many of us north of the border today. For the harried parent or
career-climbing single trying to stretch minutes and money,
quesadillas can be a quick and economical meal. Just pull out the
flour tortillas, shredded cheese and any leftover meats or
vegetables, assemble and heat.
</P>
<P>
   Sandwich scrambled eggs, chorizo sausage and cheese between two
flour tortillas and lightly toast in a skillet for a delicious
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Layer broiled shrimp, cilantro, Monterey Jack, jalapenos and
tomatillos for a dinner entree, or slice into wedges for the
appetizer table at the next cocktail party.
</P>
<P>
   Grill a tortilla stuffed with cream cheese and fruit and drizzle
with honey for a sweet treat. Or simply melt some cheese in a
folded tortilla for a side to soup or salad.
</P>
<P>
   Quesadillas barely require more cooking skills than heating up a
can of soup or dumping cereal and milk in a bowl _ but the taste
results are ever so much more satisfying. Simply layer the
ingredients on a tortilla, then fold over or stack a second
tortilla on top. The easiest way from there is to pan-grill it as
you would a grilled cheese sandwich. But quesadillas can also be
baked or deep-fried _ especially good with homemade tortillas. And
some like to zap them in the microwave (though cooking too long
will turn the tortilla into cardboard.)
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants _ understanding the unlimited popularity of bread
and melted cheese _ have unleashed their inventiveness to concoct
all kinds of combinations.
</P>
<P>
   At the popular Southwestern restaurant Nava in Buckhead,
quesadillas stuffed with pork carnitas and grilled vegetables are
offered as an appetizer. Heaping Bowl &AMP; Brew in East Atlanta
usually features a quesadilla on its daily menu, made with such
unexpected ingredients as fried green tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Any combination can be attempted, and most will prove tasty,
provided you've taken care to match flavors. Just think of some of
your favorite dishes and adapt them.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a Cobb salad can become a Cobb quesadilla by
layering a white cheese such as Monterey Jack with crumbled blue
cheese and bacon and diced avocados and tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the best ingredient for quesadillas may be an open
mind.

 &HT;    QUESADILLA RECIPES: Create magic with a little imagination
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you are in a bind for time, or want a sure hit with a
crowd, cheesy, easy quesadillas can come through.
</P>
<P>
   You need nothing more than some cheese and flour tortillas (or
corn if you prefer). But with a little imagination (or a few
leftovers) you can have much more.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of our favorite combinations, just to help you get
started.
</P>
<P>
   APPETIZER
</P>
<P>
   Goat Cheese Quesadillas With Roasted Red Peppers
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 40 minutes
</P>
<P>
   The rich goat cheese and flavorful roasted red peppers make this
a tantalizing start to any meal.
</P>
<P>
   2small onions, 1 chopped coarsely, one sliced thinly
</P>
<P>
   3garlic cloves, chopped
</P>
<P>
   3tablespoons olive oil, divided
</P>
<P>
   2red bell peppers, roasted (procedure follows; or use bottled)
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons chopped fresh basil leaves
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper
</P>
<P>
   6flour tortillas, 9 to 10 inches in diameter
</P>
<P>
   14 1/2-ounce log soft goat cheese such as Montrachet, cut into 3
pieces, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup prepared basil pesto (homemade or purchased)
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
</P>
<P>
   To make sauce: Cook chopped onion and garlic in 1 tablespoon oil
over moderate heat in a skillet, stirring until softened. Transfer
onion mixture to a food processor and add roasted peppers, basil,
remaining 2 tablespoons oil and salt and pepper to taste. Blend
sauce until smooth and transfer to a small bowl. (Sauce may be made
up to 3 days ahead and chilled, covered.)
</P>
<P>
   Put 1 tortilla on a work surface and spread with 1 goat cheese
piece, covering surface evenly. Spread 1 tablespoon pesto over goat
cheese and cover with 1/3 of sliced onion and top with second
tortilla, gently pressing layers together. Make 2 more layered
quesadillas with the remaining tortillas, goat cheese, pesto and
onion. Spread top and bottom of each quesadilla with 1 teaspoon
butter.
</P>
<P>
   Heat a griddle or well-seasoned 10-inch cast-iron skillet over
moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Cook quesadillas, 1
at a time, gently pressing down with a metal spatula, until golden,
about 4 minutes on each side. Cut each quesadilla into 8 wedges and
serve warm with roasted red pepper sauce.
</P>
<P>
   To roast peppers: Using a long-handled fork, char peppers over
an open flame or on a rack set over an electric burner, turning
them, until skins are blackened, 4 to 6 minutes. (Or broil peppers
on broiler rack about 2 inches from heat, turning every 5 minutes,
15 to 20 minutes, or until skins are blistered and charred.)
Transfer peppers to a bowl and let stand, covered, until cool
enough to handle. Keeping peppers whole, peel them, starting at
blossom end. Cut off pepper tops and discard seeds and ribs. _ From

   Dessert quesadillas are a great way to combine your favorite
fruits, berries and cream cheese, and they are much quicker than
cheesecake. We concocted this one just in time for the fall apple
season.
</P>
<P>
   6Red Delicious apples
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons plus 4 teaspoons butter, divided
</P>
<P>
   1/3cup granulated sugar
</P>

<P>
   1/2cup flavored cream cheese (with honey or raisins and nuts)
</P>
<P>
   4tablespoons toasted walnut pieces
</P>
<P>
   Sour cream or ice cream, if desired
</P>
<P>
   Peel, core and slice the apples. In a large skillet melt 2
tablespoons butter and add sugar, then apples. Saute the apples
until they are tender and slightly golden. Stir in the cinnamon.
Set aside. Spread 1/4 of the cream cheese on each of the tortillas.
On each of two tortillas layer the apples and walnuts on top of the
cream cheese and cover with remaining tortillas, cream cheese side
down. Melt 1 teaspoon butter in a heavy skillet and place one
quesadilla in the skillet. Cook over medium heat until brown and
crisp, about 3 or 4 minutes. Spread 1 teaspoon butter on top of
quesadilla, turn it over and cook remaining side another 3 to 4
minutes. Repeat for the remaining quesadilla. Cut each quesadilla
into 4 wedges. Serve two slices topped with sour cream or ice
cream.

<P>
   For the Tomato Olivada: In a medium bowl, mix the olives,
tomato, bell pepper, capers, basil and oregano. In a small bowl,
whisk the vinegar, oil, anchovy paste, garlic and hot pepper flakes
to dissolve the anchovy paste. Add to the chopped mixture and mix
well. Cover and let stand until ready to serve, preferably for at
least 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   To grill: Build a charcoal fire in an outdoor grill and let the
coals burn until medium-hot and covered with white ash. You should
be able to hold your hand over them for about 3 seconds. For each
quesadilla, place 1 tortilla on a work surface, sprinkle with 1/4
cup cheese and top with another tortilla.
</P>
<P>
   Place 2 or 3 quesadillas on the grill. Grill until the
undersides are lightly toasted, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Carefully flip
the quesadillas and toast the other sides. Transfer to a cutting
board and cut each quesadilla into 6 to 8 wedges with a sharp
knife. Arrange the quesadillas on a serving platter and serve with
a bowl of the olivada, allowing guests to spoon a dab of olivada
onto their quesadillas.
</P>
<P>
   To cook indoors: Heat a dry skillet over medium heat. Place 1
tortilla in the skillet and sprinkle with 1/4 cup cheese. Top with
another tortilla. Cook until the underside is spotted brown, about
1 minute. Turn and cook until the other side is spotted, about 1
minute more. Keep the quesadillas warm in a preheated 200 degree
oven.
</P>
<P>
   To roast red bell or poblano peppers: Position a broiler rack
about 6 inches from the source of the heat and preheat the broiler.
Broil the peppers, turning occasionally, until blackened and
blistered all over, 8 to 12 minutes. Transfer the peppers to a
paper bag, close the bag and let stand for 20 minutes to cool and
soften the peppers. Use a small sharp knife to remove the blackened
skins. _From ``The El Paso Chile Company's Sizzlin' Suppers'' by W.

   Sweet Lemon Butter melts in your mouth
</P>
<P>
   By Marcia Langhenry
</P>
<P>
   Susan Bowers of McDonough, Georgia wrote this summer with a
common request _ for something she remembered her grandmother
making but never writing down.
</P>
<P>
   Just a handful of recipes came in for the call for Lemon Butter,
a breakfast ``syrup-type delicacy'' that Bowers said her
grandmother, Mary Hesta Watson, had often made to serve on biscuits
or toast.
</P>
<P>
   This one came from Beverly McDevitt of Peachtree City, Georgia,
who said it came across the ocean from Scotland many years ago with
her mother-in-law.

 &HT;    Designer provides commentary on his line, chats with fans
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL SEPTEMBER 27: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's the picture of sartorial elegance in a gray suit, blue
shirt, patterned gold tie and his favorite shoes: brown oxfords.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar de la Renta, the 66-year-old designer from New York, was
in Atlanta recently at Neiman Marcus in Lenox Square Mall to show
his less expensive fall collection Oscar. To the delight of fans,
he provided commentary on the show, along with associate designer
Patricia Clyne. After lunching on chicken and pasta salad, he
helped customers with their purchases and posed with them for
photographs. De la Renta, who was born in the Dominican Republic
and has a second home there, easily switched from English to
Spanish during the two-hour appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia resident Gitte Claude, who wears his couture clothes,
tried on several items, including a faux leopard jacket, and said,
``with the Oscar line, I can buy more pieces for the same amount of
money that I would spend on clothes from his higher-priced
collection.'' With the exception of leathers and a coat or two, all
Oscar items are under $500. Sizes range from 2 to 16.
</P>
<P>
   Before the show, we talked with him about his designs and his
future. And by the way, you can wear brown with gray.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What's in store for the Oscar customer this fall?
</P>
<P>
   A:I've tried to make the line luxurious as well as feminine and
wearable. Many of the shapes are derivatives from my couture
collection. It's filled with sweater sets both plain and beaded;
tailored jackets and cuffed trousers; long and short skirts and
plenty of evening separates in velvets and embroidered knits. And
animal prints add a novelty touch. The palette is muted: gray,
black, brown, garnet and champagne. The fabrics include wools,
velvet, shantung, metallic knits and cashmere blends.
</P>
<P>
   Q:And hemlines?
</P>
<P>
   A:Today, when I see a very short skirt, it looks old. I think
longer skirts, below midcalf, are fresh-looking and young. Old
knees make a woman look much older!
</P>
<P>
   Q:Who is the Oscar customer?
</P>
<P>
   A:She is a younger working woman who buys her own clothes. She
wants sleeveless tops, interesting patterns and plenty of trousers.
Many of these clothes can go from a morning business appointment to
an evening engagement. An example is a simple black jersey wrap
dress trimmed in leather.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Did any celebs wear your clothes to the recent Emmy Awards
show?
</P>
<P>
   A:My good friend Candice Bergen wore one of my black satin
dresses. And actress Tea Leoni wore a light blue strapless satin
gown.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What will you be showing for spring '99?
</P>
<P>
   A:Longer skirts in lightweight fabrics that move. There will be
a touch of fullness. Also, lots of pastels and no black.
</P>
<P>
   Q:You've been in business since '65 and are at an age when you
could retire. Any plans to do that?
</P>
<P>
   A:Retiring is the most aging word. And the second most aging
word is no. As long as you have your sense of passion about your
work, and you keep your eyes alert, why retire? I have many pairs
of young eyes around me. Most of my staff is under 40.

 &HT;    P.J. O'Rourke noshes the globe
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   P.J. O'Rourke on the loose is a force to behold. A roving
correspondent for Rolling Stone magazine, he travels the world on
expense account. But instead of going to posh spots, he visits the
hellholes. And in general, the more hellish the hole, the funnier
the O'Rourke.
</P>
<P>
   He's also a conservative (after a misspent youth as a National
Lampoon editor) who's changed his politics but still writes with a
pedal-to-the-metal flamboyance. The result has been a string of
highly entertaining, original books such as the best-selling
``Parliament of Whores'' and his poisonous travelogues such as
``All the Trouble in the World.''
</P>
<P>
   This time out, O'Rourke decided to investigate why some places
are ``prosperous and thriving, while others just suck,'' to
determine how one country can have vast natural resources and still
be poor (Russia) or a starting point of near-nothing and have great
wealth (Hong Kong).
</P>
<P>
   On Rolling Stone's nickel (much of ``Eat the Rich'' appeared
there), he experiences what he calls good capitalism (Wall Street)
and bad (Albania), good socialism (Sweden) and bad (Cuba), and
places that defy easy classification (Russia). ``Russia, as a case
study, is wonderful,'' he writes. ``Unless, of course, you're a
Russian.''
</P>
<P>
   Or: ``Figuring out what the Cuban peso is worth is a complex
economic calculation. To put it in layman's terms, a pretty close
approximation is nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Rourke does much more than just parachute in and start spewing
one-liners (for that, buy Dave Barry). He does his homework,
researching speeches by Fidel Castro, explaining Albania's
geography and using statistics pointedly, though he points out
they're all outdated by now. (Heck, last week's economic statistics
from Russia are outdated.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition, O'Rourke has the best reporter's eye among today's
humorists, possibly the best ever among funny scribes. He digs for
the right details the way Tom Wolfe did in his newspaper days.
</P>
<P>
   When he visits Wall Street, for example, he notes that traders
change into sneakers and lumpy sports coats to keep their good suit
coats from being destroyed by sweat and leaky pens. But they keep
their expensive shirts and ties on. ``As a result, the average
trader is dressed like a combination bank president, produce
manager and ghetto kid who let his mom pick out his shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   When O'Rourke isn't sticking it to Swedes or Chinese, he's up to
his Irish eyebrows in college economics textbooks, trying to
understand the theories he sees in practice in various places. He
rattles off some rimshots (their prose style is ``puerile and
impenetrable, `Goodnight Moon' rewritten by Henry James''), but
there's a point of diminishing returns in slagging textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, O'Rourke gets serious, discussing what his tours
have taught him. Capitalism is better than socialism, freedom
preferable to authoritarianism, but he espoused that going in. What
surprised him, he found, was how important a fair and consistent
rule of law is in establishing prosperity. The free market is not
enough, he decides. But it beats Cuba, despite the cigars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eat the Rich: A Treatise on Economics'' by P.J. O'Rourke.
Atlantic Monthly. $25. 291 pages.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: More treat than treatise, the humorist's new book
scorches the earth as he delves into the roots of prosperity.

THE COSTLY, BITTER CASE OF THE COINS OF ELMALI 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Calif.)  (mk) 
 By BARRY MEIER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Koch once dreamed about owning an ancient coin
collection so magnificent it might be called the hoard of the
century. Now he does and he can't stand it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had more trouble with anything,'' said Koch, a
member of one of the richest families in America, as he sat on the
patio of his Cape Cod office on a recent sun-splashed day. ``I just
wish I had never seen these coins.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, Connoisseur magazine reported that treasure
hunters near the village of Elmali in southern Turkey had unearthed
a trove of ancient coins that included the rarest and most valuable
Greek coins ever found. The coins, it said, were smuggled out of
Turkey and sold to Koch (pronounced coke) and two partners.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a long-running lawsuit filed by Turkey against Koch and his
associates in the coin venture is about to go to trial. Those who
fail to take heed when buying antiquities, this case suggests, may
regret it.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the story stands Koch, an investor better known
for his idiosyncratic behavior and his taste for bitter lawsuits.
In 1992, he won the America's Cup yacht race. He has also, since
the early 1980s, repeatedly sued two of his brothers, Charles and
David, over the control of Koch Industries, the family business.
(He lost most rounds). And for a decade, he battled Massachusetts
over taxes. (He won a $43 million refund.)
</P>
<P>
   Koch and his partners in the venture _ Jonathan Kagan, a
managing director at Lazard Freres, and Jeffrey Spier, an academic
living in London _ say their coins are not the ones sought by
Turkey. But court documents suggest that they learned even before
they bought the coins that Turkish officials were apparently
looking for a recently excavated trove of coins.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1984, Silvia Hurter, a manager at Bank Leu, a Swiss bank
that is a major dealer in rare coins, wrote to Cornelius Vermeule
III, then the curator of the department of classical art at the
Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, who authenticated the coins for
Koch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rumors have it that the hoard that could reasonably be called
`the Hoard of the Century' is slowly moving to your part of the
world,'' she wrote. ``There may be one snag I'd like you to be
aware of. We heard from a reasonably reliable source of information
that the Turkish authorities are aware of it.''
</P>
<P>
   On learning of the letter, Koch said, he sought to check out the
dealers' reputations and demanded warranties that the sale was
legal. But Koch, who did not notify Turkish authorities, now
acknowledges that ``in hindsight, we should have done more
investigating.''
</P>
<P>
   The case of the treasure of Elmali is one of the most
intrigue-filled antiquities battles in recent years. Its stops
include the bazaars of Istanbul, antique shops in Munich and
renowned art museums. The cast of characters range from erudite
curators to Bruce McNall, the onetime coin dealer and owner of the
Los Angeles Kings hockey team, who has been jailed since 1997 for
bank fraud.
</P>
<P>
   A small army of coin experts has also been drawn into the legal
fray to offer theories about the discovery site, and
horticulturists have even debated the date of a key meeting based
on Koch's recollections of the flowers then in bloom.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1984 that Kagan first mentioned ancient coins, Koch
recalled. He had come to see Koch to make a pitch for Lazard
Freres' investment services when he noticed that Koch had on cuff
links made from old coins.
</P>
<P>
   Koch said that Kagan, who declined to be interviewed for this
article, said he was also a coin expert and had heard about a rare
opportunity _ ``a chance to buy the largest hoard of Greek coins
ever discovered.''
</P>
<P>
   Koch had never collected coins. But he was flush with cash,
having just received $470 million in a settlement with his
brothers. His mind began to reel with visions of how he could buy
the coins, double or triple his money by selling some of them and
still end up with one of the world's great collections. ``It really
appealed to all the greed and avarice in me at that time,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Koch is by no means the only wealthy person pursued in recent
years by foreign governments seeking to recover ancient objects
they say were stolen. Last year, for example, a federal judge
upheld the seizure of a gold platter from around 450 B.C. that was
purchased by Michael Steinhardt, the former hedge-fund manager,
which Italian officials say was smuggled out of the country.
Steinhardt is appealing.
</P>
<P>
   The legal warfare between Turkish officials and Koch is
especially bitter. In 1989, Turkey accused Koch and his partners of
knowingly buying coins that had been ``recently discovered and
illegally excavated.'' And Koch has devoted much of his sizable
resources to defending his position because he says Turkish
authorities never tried to meet him halfway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got hit by a lawsuit that made us look like criminals and
it really ticked me off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Kaye, a lawyer in New York who represents Turkey, said
Turkish officials took issue with Koch's statements but declined to
comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Among the coins involved in the case, which is to be tried in
Boston later this year, are ones so rare that fewer than 30 are
known to exist. Called decadrachms of Athens, they were made about
465 B.C. and represent the highest denomination of coinage issued
during the city's classical period. Before 1984, numismatists knew
of only 13 decadrachms, most in poor condition.
</P>
<P>
   But all that apparently changed in April 1984 when three Turkish
treasure hunters uncovered a broken earthen jar containing some
1,900 ancient coins, including a number so fresh-looking that they
appeared to have never circulated.
</P>
<P>
   In an instant, it seemed, the world's supply of decadrachms had
doubled. And while the treasure hunters knew little about the value
of their find, others would know plenty. According to a 1984
Turkish police report, the trove was bought by dealers in Istanbul,
who then sold the bulk of it to an antiquities dealer based in
Munich, Germany, who was described in the report as an
``international smuggler.''
</P>
<P>
   Before long, that dealer and two other men were marketing a
hoard, court documents suggest. It was apparently Spier, a coin
expert, who told his old friend Kagan about the coins.

<TEXT>
<P>
   A favorite wordsmith's adage contends that precedents cannot be
set, they can only be followed. In the same way, it's all but
impossible to know when the good old days are, only when they were.
</P>
<P>
   According to an entirely credible set of arguments in the
October Esquire, these are the good old days and they're about to
end. If you recall, it was in mid-October 1987 that the Dow Jones
took a 500-point dive, back when 500 points was real money. And, of
course, the big one came in mid-October 1929.
</P>
<P>
   As we approach another mid-October, writer Walter Russell Mead,
a senior fellow at the Council on Forign Relations, finds reasons
for fear everywhere. What started as a ``spot of trouble'' with the
Thai baht at the beginning of last year has now become an Asian
tsunami in which the staggering sum of $2 trillion has been lost,
so far. The forecast for Russia is bleak, and storm clouds have
gathered over Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Mexico as well. Worse,
he says, the ``experts'' _ at the International Monetary Fund, the
US Treasury, and the World Bank _ have been wrong repeatedly, and
there is no reason to believe they are learning.
</P>
<P>
   Mead then presents a history lesson, beginning with a revisit to
1928, and he finds parallels to the mid-'90s at every turn. The
stock market was setting records, fueled by millions of first-time
investors. There was growth, without inflation, and what could be
better? Prosperity and political reforms were spreading across
Europe; even Russia looked as if it ``was on its way back into the
family of nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the crash, and the war. Afterward, economic leaders
devised a new international monetary system that valued stability
over all else, and for decades it worked. But by the '60s, Mead
says, governments prodded by corporate greed rolled up the safety
net and volatility returned, just as they should have expected. But
we had forgotten the past, and now, it seems, we are condemned to
repeat it.
</P>
<P>
   Having seen this future, Esquire's editors do what they can:
They offer up strategies for protecting all the lucre you've
accumulated during the final run-up. (Sample: Invest in cigarette
and alcohol producers. ``If smokers and drinkers can't kick their
habits when times are good, don't expect mass cutbacks when nerves
are racked, pay raises scarce, and unemployment lines long.'') But
then they offer up even more doom.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K, shorthand for when the millennium scrambles most of the
computers on earth, will disrupt far more than you think, beginning
with your home computer and spreading outward. And because that's
not enough, Esquire's next feature offers ``Five Other Things to
Worry About'': mass extinction, meteor havoc (really, on Nov. 17),
oil reserves in the most volatile places, chemical castration, and
the next ice age.
</P>
<P>
   In the pages immediately following the end of the world as we
know it, a sprightly set of illustrations and quotes sketches out
the past, present, and future of the man some folks believe to be
our next president, George ``Dubya'' Bush (``Dubya'' is Texan for
W., the initial distinction between the governor and his dad).
Here's how Austin journalist Robert Bryce puts it: ``If you do the
math, you realize because his name is George Bush, he'll raise tens
of millions nationally. He wins all Texas electoral votes. Then he
wins the South because he's a moderate Republican. So the numbers
are his. It's his race to lose, as far as I can tell.''
</P>
<P>
   So let's see. In this scenario, that would make him Herbert
Hoover, right?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   There isn't enough space to list the better than 20 magazines on
the newsstands this week that offer one or more lists of something,
from six Amazing Athletic Bodies (Women's Sports and Fitness) to
400 Incredible Dresses (Modern Bride). But there are little things
we can learn by looking just at the lists that list people:
</P>
<P>
   1) Oprah has not completed her takeover, but she's gaining. The
question isn't why she appears on Vanity Fair's roster of the ``New
Establishment,'' 50 leaders of the information age _ she debuts at
No. 17 _ or why she makes Essence's list of the 20 wealthiest black
American women (duh), but why she didn't make Bazaar's 25 coolest
women on TV, or Mirabella's 25 smartest women in America.
</P>
<P>
   2) Today's smart woman goes into the entertainment business. The
likes of Jody Foster, Barbara Walters, and Shawn Colvin (Shawn
Colvin?) make up almost 40 percent of Mirabella's list. Not even
half as many, Mirabella says, are in academia. This could mean that
smart women go where the money is, or that a list of college
professors would sell a lot less magazines.
</P>
<P>
   3) Today's smart woman may go into the entertainment business,
but she's still a long way from the top. Oprah is only one of three
women on Vanity Fair's roster, and one of the others, Sherry
Lansing, has to share her perch at No. 38 with Jonathan Dolgen; the
two work together at Paramount Pictures. The other woman, venture
capitalist Ann Winblad, barely checks in, at No. 50.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in its 350 pages this month, Vanity Fair tries to be
Life-like with its photo essay of old astronauts, headlined ``The
Ripe Stuff.'' The occasion, of course, is the scheduled return to
space Oct. 29 of John Glenn, 77, 36 years after he became the first
American to orbit the earth.
</P>
<P>
   After that trip, NASA determined he was more valuable as a
space-travel promoter than as a space traveler, and he never got to
go up again. Now he's going back, and some of his old flyboy
buddies say it's still all about promotion. ``John Glenn a payload
specialist? That's (expletive),'' says Frank Borman, 70, somewhat
testily. ``It's all PR, a victory lap for John. What's he going to
do for an encore? Nuprin ads?'' Eugene Cernan, 64, is far more
charitable: ``I don't care if John just stares out the window. He's
earned it.''
</P>
<P>
   Life, which in an earlier incarnation was practically NASA's
press agency, also offers up a package, and predictably, it is more
reverential. (Headline: The Last Heroes.) Where form doesn't hold
is in the photographs; Life was once the unquestioned king, but
Vanity Fair's are much more stirring and evocative. The subjects,
meanwhile, are impressive; these guys may be geezers, but
practically all look as if they could still make the grade.

regions. (Nesmith, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   (For Texas papers) TAX-GOETZ _ WASHINGTON _ For the estate of
Nelda G. Goetz, the Internal Revenue Service is seeing the forest
but not the trees. The estate of the San Augustine, Texas, woman
filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court here claiming the IRS
valued her 1,252 acres of wooded lands at more than four times
their worth. The IRS demanded the estate pay $706,334 in additional
taxes and civil tax fraud penalties. (Moskal, Cox News Service).

   SCOTLAND-SECEDE _ LONDON _ The Northern Ireland Assembly began
work earlier this month while Scotland prepares to sit its own
parliament for the first time in decades. The Welsh also are
developing considerable independence and even Cornwall has
developed an independence movement. While the BRitish intendeded
these acts of power decentralizatrion to strengthen the United
Kingdom by instituting a kind of quasi-federalism, the result as
been to actually at heat to the fires of independence. In the
course of the century, the British Empire, once one of the world's

   RUSSIA-REGIONS _ SARATOV _ Part of the fallout from the current
economic and political crises that have been gripping Russia over
the last few months is the increasing autonomy of Russia's
provinces. Several have announced in this crisis that they no
longer intend to remit tax collections to Moscow. The Murmansk
region, without consulting with Moscow, declared a state of
emergency and appealed directly for international humanitarian
assistance. We will profile one of these regions, speaking with
people there about their feelings. (Holmes, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   With RUSSIA-BARTER _ SARATOV _ Yet another part of the fallout
is the way in which bartering has replaced cash exchange in these
regions. There are factories that are heavily involved in the
barter trade, forced to operate cash-less -- trading goods and
</P>
<P>
   materials to keep going. (Holmes, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   DISEASE-RESEARCH _ WASHINGTON _ With Congress and President
Clinton set to approve substantial increases in the research budget
of the National Institutes of Health, lobbying groups that
represent particular disease communities _ the National Cancer
Society, for example _ are lining up their forces to grab as much
of the pie as they can. Cancer groups were to ``march'' together
Saturday (Sept. 26) in solidarity for cancer research. Story will
compare data on how much money goes for each of the major diseases
_ cancer, AIDS, heart disease, etc._ how many people get killed by
those diseases, how big the budgets of the various health lobbying
groups happens to be. (Nesmith, Cox News Service 780).
</P>
<P>
   BUILDING-WASTE _ WASHINGTON _ The project has been announced and
the cost set at a whopping $1.3 billion. Can citizen watchdog
groups now slow down the construction of an enormous new Patent and
Trademark Building that they have dubbed the ``Taj Mahal''?
Lawmakers, especially those from Northern Virginia where it would
be located, tried to quell the furor over the project last week by
allowing the critics to vent. But the project is on track anyway.
Foes say stopping it is crucial to stopping a tradition of waste
and extravagance in federal buildings, such as the recently
completed Ronald Reagan Building. (Malone, Cox News Service).

   MEXICO-MASSACRE _ MEXICO CITY _ At 22, she paid a high price for
joining Mexico's student movement for freedom. On Oct. 2, 1968 _ on
the eve of the Olympic Games in Mexico _ Ana Ignacia Rodriguez was
in Mexico City's Plaza of the Three Cultures for a rally. As dusk
approached, bullets suddenly began to rain on the square, an
ancient pre-Colombian site also called Tlatelolco. ``Nacha,'' as
she was nicknamed, fled for her life as dozens, hundreds or even
thousands _nobody really knows _ were cut down by military bullets.
Within a couple of months, Nacha was detained and, along with other
students, sentenced to 16 years in prison on trumped up charges of
sedition and homicide. She served two years, part of a shocking
experience that scarred a generation and tarnished Mexico's
reputation around the world. Of all the student movements of1968,
Mexico's was perhaps the most violently repressed. Thirty years
later, Mexicans are preparing to commemorate this event, which
still remains shrouded in government secrecy. (Ferriss, Cox News
Service).

   CLINTON-AUTHORITY _ WASHINGTON _ The year was 1863, the nation
was torn by civil war and the president was struggling against
virulent forces ready to abandon the fight against a rebellion that
had split the country in two. With just 272 well-chosen words,
however, Abraham Lincoln rallied a weary people around the cause of
union and refined the purpose of their very nationhood, in what may
be the single greatest use in American history of the sheer weight
of one man's character and the authority of the office he holds. A
hundred and thirty five years after Lincoln's Gettysburg Address,
the nation is at odds once more, divided this time by the leader
himself, who's own moral authority is at the center of a battle
raging in Congress and the American public at large over whether
Bill Clinton is fit to serve. How important is moral authority to
the American presidency, where does it come from and how might
Clinton regain it if he remains in office? (Deans, Cox News Service

   TELCOM-CONGRESS _ WASHINGTON _ The scorecard is mixed when it
comes to legislative and regulator opinion on all the consolidation
in the industry. Congress isn't sure if mergers are what it had
mind when it passed the 1996 Telcom bill. FCC commisioner William
Kennard seems to think that mergers could hasten univeral access to
the Internet. Why the split? What's the likely outcome as Congress
holds hearings on this issue? (Glass, Cox News Service)

   JOURNAL-BARBADOS-$ADV01 _ Barbados _ Compared to the rest of the
Caribbean, where a 9 a.m. appointment rarely begins before 10,
Barbados is the model of efficiency. The literacy rate of 97
percent is the region's highest, while murders are nearly
non-existent. Barbadians say their success is rooted in two places:
church and school. Here, in a country of 260,000, there are more
churches than days of the year. Schoolchildren even begin and end
their days with a prayer. Girls can't wear short skirts, while
disobedient boys are paddled. (Emling, Cox News Service).

the U.S. soldiers coming here from Fort Hood, Texas to relieve
soldiers normally based in Europe have never been to Bosnia before;
some have never been stationed anywhere but Fort Hood. We'll
accompany a patrol through a northern segment of the Zone of
Separation, a narrow strip of land that winds all over the country
dividing the former warring parties. The northern part of Bosnia is
still the most contentious and their job here is very different
from soldiers who patrol the relatively quiet streets of Sarajevo.
Here, they put on flack jackets and helmets when they wake up in
the morning and they don't take them off until they go to bed, even
if they stay on McGovern Base all day long. About 1,000 soldiers
from Fort Hood will ultimately be stationed at this northern base,
with the rest scattered around the country. We'll also attend the
transfer of authority ceremony on Monday, after which it's rumored
the new commanding officer of the base plans to raise the Texas
flag next to the US one. (Nesmith, Cox News Service).

   BARBADOS-TRAVEL _ Barbados _ Tourists looking for the
``untouched'' Caribbean are in for a disappointment in Barbados.
There are no volcanoes or rain forests, and hardly any rivers. But
there are plenty of white sand beaches and lots of brighly painted
villages, flowering trees and open pastures. There are also a wide
variety of historic sites, dating back to the 17th century. There
are, for example, fabulous castles and forts to visit. Also, this
small island off South America's northern coast still retains
British influence and customs. Most people have high teas, even in

   (New). EMBASSIES-FUTURE _ WASHINGTON _ As we race into the next
century of faxes, e-mail and instant worldwide newscasting,
America's diplomatic system is still grounded in the
horse-and-buggy era. The terrorist bombings of two remote U.S.
embassies in East Africa offers a reminder that the United States
has a visible and often vulnerable presence in almost every nation,
at a cost of more than $2 billion a year. Many of these outposts
date from the Cold War era, when the United States was fighting a
propaganda war for the hearts and minds of even the tiniest nation.
But is that necessary now? After budget cuts, the U.S. State
Department has made some reductions, but U.S. domestic agencies
have created more and more overseas postings. Some experts,
including government auditors, are looking for ways to reshape the
embassy system. Among the ideas: setting up regional embassies to
serve several countries, hiring private contractors to gather
information normally collected by diplomats, and far greater use of
high tech communications. (Malone, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   With EMBASSIES-RUSSIA _ MOSCOW _ It has been several years and

Rusia be the embassy of the future, or harken back to the old
Soviet Union days? (Holmes, Cox News Service).

   DOMAINS _ HERNDON, Va. _ Just a few miles from the nation's

ending in .com, .net and .org _ Network Solutions has reached an
agreement with the University of Southern California to set up a

what stumbling blocks are ahead as company officials try to get the
plan approved by global regulators. (Regan, Cox News Service 900).

promises of increased aid. These agreements, which allow U.S.
officials to enter other countries' territorial waters and
airspace, are the cornerstone of anti-drug efforts in the region.
Drug trafficking routes have increasingly shifted to the Caribbean
amid mounting enforcement efforts on the U.S.-Mexico border. About
a third of the illegal drugs entering the United States passes
through the Caribbean. Arthur's statement is the latest, and most
troubling, sign of frustration among Caribbean leaders with U.S.
policies. Economic aid to the Caribbean has dropped from $225
million in 1985 to $25 million in 1996. The United States also has
fought European preferences for Caribbean bananas. As a result,
Caribbean countries are wondering why they should continue helping
the United States in its war on drugs. (Emling, Cox News Service).

 UNDATED: the coins. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Koch, after hearing about the coins, did some quick math and
decided it was a no-lose deal. Starting in mid-1984, he and his
partners bought some 1,700 coins for about $3.2 million. He
estimated that if marketed right they could bring $7.5 to $10
million.
</P>
<P>
   But even before Koch and his associates bought the first coins,
the Bank Leu letter arrived. In it, Ms. Hurter said that Turkish
officials were apparently looking for the coins because ``one of
the peasants on the find-spot bought a Mercedes or did something
similarly intelligent.''
</P>
<P>
   Koch, then a trustee of the Museum of Fine Arts, soon went to
the museum, where some of the coins had been sent for
authentication. (``There were satyrs raping nymphs,'' he recalled
recently. ``Heads of Athenian bulls, all kinds of art forms.'')
When he was walking out of the museum, Vermeule told him about the
letter, Koch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His comment was, `I don't think there is anything to it, don't
worry about it,' or something like that,'' Koch has testified.
```These coins are beautiful, you'll get pleasure out of them, they
won't cause you problems.''' Vermeule, who retired in 1996, did not
return calls seeking comment. But he has indicated in pretrial
testimony that he did not have such a conversation with Koch.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Koch said he was concerned enough to take action, asking
Kagan and Spier to look into the issue. Both men soon reported back
that they believed that Ms. Hurter was trying to scare off Koch so
she could move in and buy the hoard cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hurter declined to be interviewed. But Alan Walker, an
employee at Leu Numismatics, as the coin-dealing unit is now known,
said Ms. Hurter maintains that she wrote to Vermeule as an old
friend. Walker said any suggestion that Ms. Hurter's letter was a
subterfuge was ``a little too Machiavellian.''
</P>
<P>
   Koch and his partner pushed ahead after requiring the dealers to
sign warranties that the sale was legal. They began to exhibit the
coins and seek buyers. But their problems were only beginning.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Ozgen Acar, a Turkish journalist who specialized in
antiquities, began to investigate. And in the 1988 Connoisseur
article, of which he was a co-author, he described how the trail
led him to Koch.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish officials soon moved to reclaim some coins. In 1988,
they approached McNall, the dealer, after he displayed on the cover
of a catalog coins he had purchased from the Koch group. McNall
turned over the coins but, at the time, rejected Turkey's claims.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, McNall has apparently changed his view.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were presented with compelling facts that the items in
question had been recently excavated from Turkey and we wanted to
avoid legal controversy,'' he said in a recent telephone interview
from prison.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Koch's foray into numismatics was also collapsing.
He said he quickly realized that the market was too small to absorb
all his coins, and while he had sold about $1 million worth, some
buyers, apparently fearful of Turkey's claims, soon demanded their
money back.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeule also expressed caution. In a 1988 letter to Koch he
wrote: ``It would be wise to let the dust settle before exhibiting
the coins. One doesn't want a process server from the Turkish
Embassy's New York lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, Koch and his partners have asserted that their
coins are not the ones sought by Turkey. To back that up, they
point to several meetings they say took place before the discovery
of the Elmali hoard in which they were either shown the coins or
had discussed buying them.
</P>
<P>
   Koch has testified, for example, that his initial meeting with
Kagan took place around April 1984 _ possibly predating the
discovery of the coins. He said he had no records of the meeting
but he distinctly recalled it because some of his favorite flowers,
like fragrant viburnum, were in bloom. Turkish lawyers, though,
countered with an expert who testified that based on 1984 weather
records, fragrant viburnum could not have bloomed in Massachusetts
before mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   But Koch and his associates may have bigger problems. Before the
lawsuit was filed, Spier, a partner in the coin venture, wrote
scholarly and academic papers that stated that a hoard containing
decadrachms had been discovered in an area within modern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Spier, who declined to be interviewed, has since testified that
his views were speculative. But in a January ruling, U.S. District
Judge Richard Stearns described Spier's earlier writing as part of
a catalog of ``self-inflicted wounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Koch says his days of investing in antiquities _ or any business
he knows nothing about _ are over. And since 1989, the coins have
been entombed once again, this time in a safe-deposit box awaiting
the drama's outcome.
</P>
<P>
   But Koch appears to be looking forward to participating again in
a field he knows quite a bit about: lawsuits. According to
documents filed by his lawyers, some people involved in the
excavation and sale of the Elmali horde have contended that their
confessions were extracted after torture. And Koch says he believes
he has an even shot of convincing a jury that he did not buy the
treasure of Elmali.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a toss of a coin,'' he said.

 &HT;    Fall season offers ideal conditions for planning, planting,
perfecting
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   No more excuses.
</P>
<P>
   Those 90-degree-plus afternoons have waned, the haze of dogs
days has lifted and weekend getaways have gone the way of holiday
fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   A new season brings out energy in gardeners and nongardeners
alike, so what better time to tackle those outdoor projects you put
off all sweltering summer?
</P>
<P>
   ``Right about now, people get itchy to get back outside and get
back to it,'' said Sally Alcock of Hasting's Nature &AMP; Garden
Center.
</P>
<P>
   But there's far more reason to regroup on gardening than the
simple fact you no longer break a sweat when you step out onto your
doorstep. Fall is the best time to plant because new trees, shrubs
and perennials won't be subjected to the stress of the heat that
follows spring, when most folks think about planting. Fall planting
allows roots time to grow strong over the winter and gives next
spring's blooms a head start.
</P>
<P>
   Autumn also is an ideal season for analyzing your garden's
trouble spots _ what worked and what didn't during the summer _ and
moving plants to more appropriate areas.
</P>
<P>
   If it's fall and winter color you're after, you'd better get
going. New annuals _ pansies, chrysanthemums and ornamental
vegetables _ are arriving daily at the garden center, so hurry
while the selection's best. They can be planted in the coming weeks
as daytime highs cool to the low 80s but soil remains warm,
inviting new roots to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``People get frustrated when they spend all this money on
pansies and do all this bed preparation, then we get a hard freeze
and they don't bounce back. That's because they need to plant them
in late September so the roots will be well-established by
winter,'' said Sharon Roth of Pike Family Nurseries.
</P>
<P>
   If it's a spring splash you're planning, start digging. Most
bulbs _ crocuses, hyacinths, daffodils _ can be planted beginning
in October (wait until November for tulips, Alcock said).
</P>
<P>
   ``Fall is also a good time of year for planting any kind of
perennial herbs,'' said Denise Smith of GardenSmith Greenhouses in
Jefferson, which sells more than 500 varieties and more than 300
vegetables. ``A lot of them are evergreen, and when you get the
late warm days you can still cut them for cooking, and they're
still fragrant.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if planting's not your thing, there are plenty of lawn
chores to attend to, including winterizing your tools and equipment
so they'll be in top order come spring.
</P>
<P>
   So, just when you thought you could take a break from yardwork,
there's plenty to do.

 &HT;    Fall gardening tips
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Extend the summer, plan for winter
</P>
<P>
   -- Plant fall-blooming annuals for color _ pansies, violas,
mums. Group them in drifts, not in a line, to make a splash. Mix
them with evergreens to provide a contrast. They need full sun and
well-drained soil.
</P>
<P>
   -- Plant vegetables _ both ornamental and edible _ for
interesting leaf color and texture. Consider Ruby Red chard,
curly-leaf mustard, Red Giant mustard, arugula, collards, kale,
lettuce, spinach and parsley. Pair yellow pansies with Red Giant
mustard (whose purple leaves taste like Dijon mustard). Try less
predictable ornamentals, such as Scotch thistle (which has fuzzy
silver leaves) and mizuna (with delicate fernlike foliage). All
need full sun and well-drained soil.
</P>
<P>
   -- Plant perennials for fall color and interest. Combine them in
containers with fall annuals.
</P>
<P>
   -- Extend the life of summer containers by replacing waning
summer annuals with fall ones and maintaining evergreen perennials.
Try brilliant mums combined with rubus and golden creeping Jenny or
mix mums, various salvias and autumn fern.
</P>
<P>
   -- Dig, divide and transplant summer perennials, such as
Rudbeckia and purple coneflower, that have multiplied or failed to
perform in a particular area.
</P>
<P>
   -- Plant new spring- and summer-flowering perennials so their
roots will have time to establish during winter. As a rule,
perennials planted in fall perform better than those planted in
spring.
</P>
<P>
   -- Continue to deadhead spent blossoms and prune dead foliage,
except on large woody plants such as lantana. (Its hollow stems can
collect water in spring and freeze.) As a rule, most pruning should
cease in fall to discourage new growth vulnerable to cold.
</P>
<P>
   -- Grind leaves with a bagging lawn mower and use them to mulch
around shrubs or add to the soil in the vegetable garden. Consider
starting a compost pile with all those leaves, limbs and other
garden debris.
</P>
<P>
   -- Clean out beds and amend the soil with a fresh 2-inch layer
of compost, composted manure or other organic matter.
</P>
<P>
   -- Dig up tender summer bulbs, such as caladiums, dahlias and
elephant's-ear, dry them for a week and store them in peat moss for
winter.
</P>
<P>
   -- Plant spring-flowering bulbs in sunny, well-drained soil.
Most can be planted beginning in late September, but tulips should
wait until November.
</P>
<P>
   -- For lawn color, overseed Bermuda and centipede grasses (but
not zoysia) with rye as daytime temperatures reach only the low
70s.
</P>
<P>
   -- Aerate, fertilize, lime and reseed fescue grass. Apply
crabgrass pre-emergents (but not on newly seeded or sodded lawns).

 &HT;    ``I simply want to make nice clothes of the best quality and the
best fit. ...''
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL SEPTEMBER 27: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine a shopping excursion to a store such as Saks Fifth
Avenue in which you discover the clothes racks filled with
Nordstrom's private label merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the scenario set up for next spring, when Jeffrey
Kalinsky's signature line of apparel will start showing up in tony
boutiques from coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at a mere 35 years of age, Kalinsky's proven himself to be
one of Atlanta's most inspired entrepreneurs and perhaps the city's
most devout worshipper of high fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think fashion really is his passion,'' said Linda Dresner,
the owner of boutiques bearing her name in New York and Birmingham,
Mich., and an associate of Kalinsky's for the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Kalinsky's eight-year rise to prominence in Atlanta has been
distinguished by his successful opening, owning and operating of
the conjoined Bob Ellis Shoes, Jil Sander and Jeffrey boutiques.
His name stands a chance of resonating nationally now that a
clothing collection of his own creation is going to be sold at
Dresner's stores as well as at the ultra-chic Ultimo shops in
Chicago, San Francisco and Dallas and the Janet Brown boutiques in
Long Island, N.Y., Savannah and Santa Monica, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality of the merchandise is quite high,'' Dresner said
in reference to the Kalinsky Rubenstein apparel being produced
jointly by Kalinsky and former Tse Cashmere designer David
Rubenstein.
</P>
<P>
   The premiere Kalinsky Rubenstein collection includes: cashmere
pullovers the color of Kalinsky's eyes (sea blue) for $895; men's
Capri-length pants in stretch Tasmanian wool for $425; $1,000
alligator sandals from Manolo Blahnik's factory; and seersucker
pants with Velcro flies for $295.
</P>
<P>
   ``The items they've chosen to highlight are very much in keeping
with what's going on in fashion today,'' Dresner added. ``The
pieces of theirs that we've chosen will mix well with our other
collections, which are the very best. We bought deeply in the
pieces we wanted, and we think they'll sell well.''
</P>
<P>
   Randee Lieppe represents the faithful customers of Kalinsky's
who'll likely buy pieces of the new collection out of a sense of
hometown pride. ``I think it's exciting,'' she said while browsing
at Jil Sander. ``It's fun feeling like a part of this.''
</P>
<P>
   This new venture, Kalinsky maintains, is by no means an attempt
at competing with designers such as Richard Tyler, Helmut Lang or
Sander, whose clothes he sells.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a designer,'' Kalinsky said. ``I'm just an arbiter of
good taste. There are many, many brilliant designers in this world,
and I respect them all. I simply want to make nice clothes of the
best quality and the best fit to fill in the voids in my customers'
wardrobes.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he gets his gratification from knowing that other
upscale retailers think enough of his apparel to stock it right
along with other prestige labels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeffrey's doing this because it's what he's always wanted to
do,'' said Jim Whitlow, manager and assistant buyer for Kalinsky's
stores since the beginning. ``He told me when he first started the
collection that no matter if it's successful or not, he's happy
because he's finally done it. He had a dream and that dream's
coming true.''

 &HT;    Winter tips for gardens
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Assess problems, focus on trees and don't forget houseplants
</P>
<P>
   -- Take stock of garden areas that are bare and improve them by
adding evergreens or other plants that provide seasonal interest,
such as those with berries or defoliating bark.
</P>
<P>
   -- Plant trees, shrubs, vines and ground covers so that their
roots can establish before the stress of heat returns.
</P>
<P>
   -- Do not water plants as frequently because of shorter days and
longer nights.
</P>
<P>
   -- Keep houseplants away from heat sources and open vents, which
will cause leaves to turn brown on the edges.
</P>
<P>
   -- Invite birds by planting shrubs that produce berries in
winter, such as hollies, viburnums, cherry laurel, wax myrtle,
pyracantha, mahonias and nandina.
</P>
<P>
   -- Apply post-emergents to control winter broadleaf weeds in
lawns in November and December.
</P>
<P>
   -- Prune trees until February. Never top a tree; simply cut side
and lower limbs.
</P>
<P>
   -- Clean old grass, leaves and dirt from the lawn mower and oil
parts as needed before storing for winter. Sharpen or replace the
blade, empty the gas tank and detach the spark plug wire.
</P>
<P>
   -- Have broken equipment repaired instead of waiting until
spring, when shops are busy.
</P>
<P>
   -- Set out plant markers to identify where perennials, which
have now died back, are planted so that you won't dig in those
spots. Or draw a diagram indicating plant locations.
</P>
<P>
   -- Fertilize fall and winter annuals, such as pansies and mums,
as needed, typically once a week.
</P>
<P>
   -- Do not fertilize shrubs and other woody plants because they
will produce tender growth that will be susceptible to burn in cold
weather.
</P>
<P>
   -- Fertilize cool-season grasses.
</P>
<P>
   -- Mulch beds to protect roots and conserve moisture. About 1 to
2 inches of bark or several inches of pine straw or leaves under a
plant can protect it from sudden changes in soil temperature and
moisture.
</P>
<P>
   -- Provide extra protection during hard freezes by covering
tender plants with old blankets (not plastic).
</P>
<P>
   -- Remove water hyacinths, lettuce and other tropical plants
from ponds.
</P>
<P>
   -- Force spring bulbs, such as paperwhites, hyacinths and
tulips, indoors in a cool sunny place.
</P>
<P>
   -- Order seeds for spring.
</P>
<P>
   -- Tackle landscape construction projects you put off all
summer.

 &HT;    Adman critiques current campaigns

<TEXT>
<P>
   Taco Bell
</P>
<P>
   ``The Taco Bell Chihuahua is one of my favorites. Most of my
clients love it too.
</P>
<P>
   I understand that Chiat/Day sort of stumbled onto this little
critter. They did a one-off (single commercial) for some promotion
using the little, hairless dog. But they got such good feedback on
it, they wisely rolled the little guy into the main body of their
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Had they had to send this concept through the regular testing
channels, I suspect it would not have come out of the focus groups
alive. I can just see some guy in a focus group deep-sixing this
thing by protesting, `What do you mean you're going to try to sell
burritos by featuring a disgusting little hairless dog?'''

<P>
   The Gap
</P>
<P>
   ``I like a stripped down idea that depends more on the idea than
the money spent on production values. In fact, all things being
equal, I will always opt for the simpler of two ideas. Two totally
great spots, side by side, I give the gold to the idea that solves
the same problem more simply.
</P>
<P>
   So, long story short. I like that stuff mostly for its
simplicity. Some of it is a little too `cool' for me, but I am no
longer a 25-year-old shopping for jeans.''

 &HT;    CANCER DEMONSTRATION FOR PUBLIC AWARENESS _ AND DOLLARS
 &HT;    For release Saturday, Sept. 26.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As cancer survivors participated this weekend in
``the March,'' a nationwide demonstration against the disease,
organizers of the affair had their eyes on more than $14 billion
the government spends each year on medical research.
</P>
<P>
   Many cancer survivors feel that given the number of lives it
takes, the disease does not get a fair share of federal research
funds distributed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), said
Ellen Stovall, president of the March.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we feel we are getting a disproportionately small
share,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The main purpose of the March, she said, was to raise public
awareness of the need for increased government funding for
research.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to an actual event on the Mall in downtown
Washington on Saturday, the nationwide show of force included
satellite events in more than 150 other U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
   The event was supported by celebrities such as retired Army Gen.
Norman Schwarzkopf, honorary chairman of the event, and television
newsman Sam Donaldson, both survivors of prostate cancer, as well
as numerous corporate sponsors, including some pharmaceutical
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Patterned after the annual Earth Day expressions of concern
about the environment, the March was an attempt to bring together
support from different groups that have traditionally lobbied
independently, sometimes competitively, for research dollars for
specific types of cancer, said Stovall, who founded and heads the
National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know from the advance reports that 500,000 people will
participate nationwide,'' Stovall said. She said supporters were
organizing bike-a-thons, walk-a-thons, marches, road races and
rallies around the country.
</P>
<P>
   She said the idea for the event came during an appearance on
CNN's ``Larry King Live'' talk show when King asked her and
Donaldson why people ``aren't marching in the streets'' over the
need for more cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the March comes after congressional leaders and the
Clinton administration have already committed themselves to
doubling the National Institutes of Health budget for medical
research over the next five years. The NIH increase contained in an
appropriation bill still pending in Congress for next year amount
to about 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although estimates of the government investment in cancer
research since 1971, when then-president Richard Nixon committed
the country to a ``war on cancer,'' have ranged as high as $25
trillion, a hoped-for ``breakthrough'' cure has evaded scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The search has followed different tracks and moved at different
speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Some forms of cancer, most notably breast cancer, receive
substantially greater research support than others. This has been
seen as part of a ``squeaky wheel'' tendency that supposedly causes
federal agencies to be more responsive to political pressure than
to need when they set priorities for financial support or
regulatory actions.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, factors other than pressure - such as public concern or
indications a disease like HIV is spreading out of control - can
affect differences in levels of research support.
</P>
<P>
   Government data show that cancer fares less well than some other
diseases in the competition for federal funds, and far better than
some others.
</P>
<P>
   In fiscal 1997, the last year for which comparable statistics
are available, the NIH invested about $1.5 billion on AIDS
research. The National Center for Health Statistics reported that
32,655 people died of the disease in 1996, the comparable calendar
year.
</P>
<P>
   That works out to federal research support of $45,965 for each
AIDS death.
</P>
<P>
   NIH cancer research funding in fiscal 1997 was $2.76 billion and
cancer deaths in 1996 totaled 544,278 _ a research expenditure of
only $5,072 per cancer death.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the country largest killer, heart disease,
took 733,834 lives in 1996, while NIH was spending $1.08 billion on
cardiovascular research _ or $1,472 per death.
</P>
<P>
   Stovall said the March ``isn't just about funding,'' and that
some participants were concerned about issues involving quality of
care and access to treatment among minorities and underserved
communities.
</P>
<P>
   She said a ``science task force'' had developed a report on the
type of research most needed to deal with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The task force, which includes representatives of private
industry, also would recommend ``some changes, perhaps, in federal
regulatory systems that impede research.''
</P>
<P>
   The report was not available last week and would not be released
until a week after the March, she said.

WOMEN OF IVY IN A SILVER YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tenty-five years ago, the Ivy League conference officially
opened up its doors to women. But if those women were part of
history, they didn't notice it at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the first year of rowing looked the same to us as the
next year,'' said Wiki Royden, who was on the crew team at Harvard
and graduated in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   But as that first year has grown into 25, the Ivy League is
pausing to put it into perspective. So starting at Harvard this
month, and ending at Columbia in April, the Ivy League is
celebrating a quarter-century of women's athletics with a traveling
exhibit of an 8-by-17-foot mural that will be at each of the eight
colleges. Although the day of roundtable and panel discussions with
alumnae on Saturday are not open to the public, the mural depicting
women's Ivy athletics will be on display at the Murr Center through
mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Orleans, commissioner of the Ivy League, acknowledged that
25 years is not that long ago. On the other hand, he said, the
women's Ivy was the first women's collegiate conference in the
country; the Pac 10, Big 10, and other conferences came later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two things happened 25 years ago,'' said Orleans about the
Ivies opening up a league for women. ``The schools started
enrolling women, and as Title IX passed, we had more women athletes
who wanted to have a league to be equal.''
</P>
<P>
   For the silver anniversary celebration, the Ivy League has asked
each college to name two athletes from each sport to be on its
Honor Roll team; in addition, Harvard had named its own roster of
all-star teams, ranging from RoAnn Costin (class of '74, swimming)
to Alliston Feaster (class of '98, basketball). In between are
athletes who include the ice hockey gold-medal Olympians from last
winter, the undefeated squash team of 1997, and Sharon Beckman
(class of '80) who became the first New England woman to swim the
English Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Royden, the former rower who is now a geophysics professor at
MIT, said that when she entered Harvard in the early 1970s, it
meant little to her that she was on the ground floor of the Ivy
League.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our perspective, (being part of a league) didn't matter,
but the cumulative effect of it was big. I think that's what the
numbers show,'' she said, referring to the honor roll list of
athletes that's mostly populated with graduates from the '80s and
'90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think as there become more athletes in college, high
school sports are more serious. But I think it was a slow
evolution. We didn't notice it right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Henry, the senior associate athletic director at Harvard,
said that 25 years ago the college had 200 women playing sports on
eight teams; now the number has jumped to 550 women playing 20
sports. And the Ivy League sponsors more championships for women _
16 _ than any other conference, and has more women competing.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, women were involved in sports intercollegiately for a
long time, but it was on a club, not a league, level.
</P>
<P>
   ``There had been limited publicity and often none at all about
what women were doing in sports,'' said Paula Welch, who is writing
a book on the League's Silver Anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Welch said the Ivy League was at the forefront of making
conferences coed, in part because of ``movers and shakers'' in the
Ivy League physical education departments who wanted to get more
organized.
</P>
<P>
   One of those movers was Arlene Gorton, a graduate of Brown
(Class of '52) who went on to become a professor in the physical
education department and the associate athetic director. She
retired last summer after 37 years there.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said that Brown and Pembroke had a relationship similar
to Harvard and Radcliffe, with separate admissions, but combined
faculty and classes. There were no women at Yale, Dartmouth, and
Colombia, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when women were added to other Ivies, we wanted to
implement our own league,'' Gorton said. The men's teams formed the
Ivy League in 1954. ``We went to the athletic directors and said we
wanted to have an Ivy for women, and they said go ahead. So we
developed a plan.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Radcliffe won the first Ivy League championship in a
woman's sport, in rowing; in 1975, Princeton won the first Ivy
League title in basketball; and in 1976, basketball and tennis
player Alison Muscatine of Harvard became the first female
letter-winner in the country to get a Rhodes scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The League meant a competitive equality,'' she said. ``We were
competing against schools with the same academic standards, and it
gave us an identity.'' Eventually, she said, the women had
guidelines for schedules and practices, restrictions, and more
funding.
</P>
<P>
   And the changes, Gorton said, were striking.
</P>
<P>
   Before, she said, the teams (who would often drive eight hours
in the coaches' car to a play a visiting team) would sleep three,
and sometimes four to a room.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we added two girls to the field hockey team we didn't
have enough uniforms, so we'd surround the girl on the sideline
while she changed,'' Gorton said, ``And we had so many cookie,
candy, and bake sales to raise money.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't that she minded having to raise the money, she
said; it was that the men's and women's teams weren't treated
equally, pre-Ivy League.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the women were doing fundraising, and the men were getting
new cleats. Or practice uniforms, or a training table.'' Not to
mention that the teams would have to practice early in the morning
or late at night to accommodate the men's teams.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some things are bound to never change, like the fact
that the Division 1 Ivy League forbids any athletic scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   So sure, the conference is full of Rhodes Scholars _ but
sometimes the Rhodes Scholars go on to be national champions or
even Olympians.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, said a former Harvard coach and swimmer, the school no
longer needs to make good athletes out of good students.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, I'd get one of two good swimmers, then we'd get one or
two who we'd make great,'' said former coach Maura Costin Scalise.
``Now they can go out there and recruit great swimmers with great
grades.''

   SALMON-ATLANTIC (Undated) Provincial and federal governments now
have proof that Atlantic salmon introduced for fish farming are
reproducing in the wild, which could devastate wild salmon runs.
Many biologists and the fish farming companies have said the fish
can't reproduce in the wild, and hence pose little threat to wild
stocks. If this is proof that they can, it could signal a death
knell to native stocks, as the farm-raised fish could spread
disease, destroy wild salmon nesting areas, even eat baby wild
salmon. Unlike the native fish, the farmed variety don't die after
spawning. The salmon were found mid-August in the Tsitika River on
Vancouver Island. Four of 12 juveniles seen, representing two-year
classes, were captured and examined by provincial biologists. In a
report to the fisheries minister, the find is called ``the first
verified report of successful reproduction for introduced Atlantic
salmon, anywhere in the world.''

HEEBNER SEES REITS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CASH IN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ken Heebner has some advice for you: Mortgage your house, borrow
anything you can, and invest it in real estate investment trusts.
``REITs today dwarf any other opportunity around to make money,''
says Heebner, one of Boston's most storied stock pickers. ``This is
a historic opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Heebner's advice on real estate trusts, or REITs, is not new; he
has been banging this drum for a couple of years. But now, after
watching REITs get crushed since April, the market is finally
starting to go his way.
</P>
<P>
   The Morgan Stanley REIT index jumped nearly 4 percent Tuesday,
extending the gain over the last seven trading days to 13 percent.
The surge was inspired, at least in part, by two influential Wall
Street analysts who upgraded their outlook for the REIT sector in
the last few days. The index remains down 13.5 percent for the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly traded REITs invest in all kinds of real estate. The
bear market that has overtaken these stocks has been costly not
only to funds dedicated to real estate, but to plenty of general
equity funds that have also made their own big bets on the sector.
</P>
<P>
   Heebner is Exhibit A: His CGM Realty fund was down 22.3 percent
this year through Monday. And his CGM Mutual fund, which has 26
percent of its assets in REITs, was down 10.5 percent; other
balanced funds were up 3 percent for the same period, according to
Lipper Analytical Services.
</P>
<P>
   Other general equity funds have also buckled under the REIT
effect. Merrill Lynch Growth fund, with 23 percent of its assets in
REITs, is down 24.7 percent this year; Barron Growth &AMP; Income (17
percent in REITs) is down 19.6 percent; and Prudential Equity
Income (14 percent in REITs) is down 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Says Heebner: ``I think the turn has come.'' Heebner likes REITs
because they are yielding 7 3/4 percent while cash flow is growing
at 15 percent this year and should add another 10 percent next
year. The stocks are Asia-free and could get a boost if the Federal
Reserve cuts interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next six months you could make 30 percent without much
risk,'' he says. ``And you are getting paid 7 3/4 percent while you
wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Larry Raiman, an analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette, raised his rating to ``buy'' from ``hold'' on REITs; he
was the first to cut his rating to hold on the sector back in
February. A day earlier another analyst, Lehman Brothers' Steve
Hash, also raised his rating.
</P>
<P>
   Raiman suggested developers are starting to face a ``capital
crunch'' as commercial banks and others begin putting the brakes on
real estate lending. Such a crunch could ease the fears of
overbuilding and ease property prices, making acquisition by REITs
more doable.
</P>
<P>
   Heebner is most excited about office REITs, where he has about
70 percent of money. He also likes shopping center and apartment
REITs, but has some concerns about hotel REITs and is turned off by
specialty REITs set up for golf courses, prisons and the like. He
is focusing his investments on cities like Boston, New York,
Chicago, and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his optimism and the recent bounce in REIT prices, this
has been a tough year for Heebner, who is on the cover of the
current Money magazine along with other famous stock pickers like
Peter Lynch and Michael Price. Almost across the board his funds
are at or near the bottom of their categories.
</P>
<P>
   His best-known fund, CGM Capital Development, was down 16.17
percent through Sept. 17, ranking it 939 out of 985 growth funds
tracked by Lipper. CGM Mutual was 403 of 404 balanced funds; his
CGM Fixed Income (with about 20 percent of its money in
REIT-related securities) was dead last in its category; and his
newest fund, CGM Focus, was down 16.63 percent, putting it in the
bottom quintile. His Realty fund is also near the bottom of its
group.
</P>
<P>
   Heebner is famous for having these kind of years. He is a
swing-for-the-fences money manager who can put up huge numbers when
he is right _ and fall flat on his face when he is not, like in
1994 when Capital Development lost a stunning 23 percent. He says
his problems have not only been related to REITs, but to a number
of individual stock picks that simply have not worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened to my funds has happened many times in the
past,'' Heebner says. The difference today, he says, is that
investors ``have gotten used to the idea that stocks don't go down.
We may be returning to a more normal pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one oddity this year: While all of Heebner's CGM funds
have gotten tagged, the New England Growth fund, which he manages
for Boston-based NVest, is doing well. That fund is up 9.21 percent
for the year, putting it in the top quintile of growth funds. The
fund, which has no REIT holdings, is doing well because it is
focused on large capitalization stocks, which have been in favor,
Heebner says.
</P>
<P>
   Heebner's enthusiasm for REITs knows no bounds. The last time he
was so enthusiastic about an investment was back in 1981. Then,
Treasury bonds were yielding 15 percent, and he did in fact go out
and borrow money, including remortgaging his house, to invest. As
it turned out, Heebner was too far ahead of the market and he faced
a painful margin call. ``I was too early and I got snuffed out,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   He is betting his timing is right this time.

MOSQUITO OUTBREAK STINGS SOUTHEAST TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>

By ALLAN TURNER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ First came the rains, then the floods, then the clouds
of mosquitoes so thick that, in some parts of coastal Texas,
breathing outdoors at dusk is nearly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   As many as six species of salt marsh, floodwater, Asian Tiger
and disease-carrying Culex mosquitoes are swarming in Southeast
Texas in what some officials call the worst outbreak in more than
20 years.
</P>
<P>
   In parts of Houston, where two cases of mosquito-transmitted St.
Louis encephalitis have been confirmed, an exposed human arm will
attract 30 to 50 mosquitoes in a minute.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazoria County, where the small town of Clute hosts an
annual mosquito festival, young calves are choking to death on the
insects. And around Beaumont, a mosquito-blocking bandana worn over
the nose and mouth is almost mandatory for late-afternoon outdoor
activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is extremely frustrating,'' said Lee Chastant, director
of Jefferson County Mosquito Control in Beaumont, ``is that we
spray 45,000 acres a day, 24 hours a day, but when we come back
later, the area is totally reinfested. You can't even tell that we
had been there.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 10-day period, Chastant said this week, Beaumont crews
sprayed 5,000 gallons of malathion _ one of the two potent
insecticides in the mosquito busters' arsenal _ and desperately
were seeking more.
</P>
<P>
   In Harris County, mosquito control director Ray Parsons said 19
trucks were spraying malathion or a second chemical, resmetherin,
seven nights a week. But, he admitted, ``We could be using 100
trucks and still not be able to keep up.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that will end The Big Itch for Southeast Texans,
experts admit, is a prolonged spell of cold weather. And such a
cold snap isn't likely for another six to eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Olson, a medical entomologist whose department at Texas A&AMP;M
University in College Station is exploring genetic engineering and
other high-tech solutions to mosquito control, noted Houston's
problems began early in the summer with bumper crops of Culex and
Asian Tiger mosquitoes, both of which breed in stagnant water.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the torrential rains of recent tropical storms that
ignited an explosive growth of salt marsh and floodwater mosquito
populations.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the floodwater mosquito eggs may have lain in dry cow
tracks or other shallow depressions for three or four years,
waiting for the right conditions to hatch, Olson said. ``Then along
comes good old (Tropical Storm) Frances,'' he said. ``I call these
`instant mosquitoes' _ they all come at once.''
</P>
<P>
   Salt marsh-breeding Aedes mosquitoes can easily fly 40 or more
miles when they make use of favorable winds; flood-breeding
Psorophora insects can travel 15 to 20 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston caught it from both directions,'' Olson said. ``From
the marshes on the coast and the grasslands to the north and
west.''
</P>
<P>
   In their battle against the blood-thirsty swarms, area mosquito
control crews have relied primarily on organophosphate insecticide.
From the air or street level, they nightly have saturated the
atmosphere with microscopic particles of the poison. Its success is
dependent on hitting the tiny flying targets _ once the poison is
on the ground it does no good.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like duck hunting,'' Olson said. ``If you put enough
buckshot in the air, you'll hit something.''
</P>
<P>
   While mosquito-killing bacteria or toxins from such bacteria
have been available for some years, problems with their
application, longevity and cost remain. A&AMP;M researchers are working
to fine tune those approaches, which attack the insect in its
larval stage. Additionally, A&AMP;M is about to launch research into
genetically altering mosquitoes to eliminate their blood lust,
Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even without human opposition, though, life is tough for
mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with fish, fungi, spiders, bacteria and a host of other
predators, as few as 20 percent of hatching mosquitoes live to
adulthood. But each female _ after imbibing one or more blood meals
_ can lay more than 1,000 eggs in her lifetime of 30 days or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their life expectancy is pretty rotten,'' Olson said. ``But
it's like the edict of Mao Tse-tung: Overwhelm your enemy with
numbers. Put the numbers out there and you'll get one through.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, little disease has been associated with the mosquito
outbreak, but the potential is worrisome, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Two Houston men, one 31 and the other 45, were diagnosed with
St. Louis encephalitis, a potentially fatal viral infection of the
brain and spinal cord spread by Culex mosquitoes. But Houston
health department spokeswoman Kathy Barton said both victims are
recovering.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, 30 encephalitis cases were diagnosed in Houston
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   While state health officials said no other disease-carrying
mosquitoes have been collected in Southeast Texas, they noted the
insects also are capable of transmitting malaria, yellow fever,
dengue and other serious illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more global interaction we have with humans from tropical
disease zones,'' Olson said, ``the more risk. Yellow fever is
flaring up in South America. We have all the right vectors for
these diseases to show up. We didn't get rid of them. They're here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing saving our neck is our lifestyle. The bulk
of humanity (here) lives in buttoned-up, air-conditioned
environments. Only occasionally do we expose ourselves to
mosquitoes.''
</P>
<P>
   When people do expose themselves to mosquitoes without insect
repellant, they are almost certain to be bitten.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County's Parsons noted that researchers trying to measure
the severity of Houston's mosquito infestation exposed their bare
arms, then counted insect landings. The rate ranged between 30 and
50 landings per minute, the entomologist said. And even five
landings a minute is deemed uncomfortable. ``We're looking for
volunteers,'' he quipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mosquitoes have night vision,'' Olson said. ``The first things
they detect are slow-moving, dark objects. As they move in closer,
they pick up on gradients of carbon dioxide. They find 100 percent
carbon dioxide, then they start sensing heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why they move in on your ankles or wrists. They land.
Then they start sensing for enzymes and saltwith their feet _
that's when they begin probing actively. One taste of the right
salt content for blood and they go to sucking.''
</P>
<P>
   The meal can last up to a minute, and if interrupted in mid-sup,
Olson said, the little blood suckers often will return for a second
course. ``They will come back if you're the only meal in town,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Beaumont, mosquito control director Chastant reported
mosquitoes so thick it was necessary for him to wear a bandana over
his mouth and nose in order to mow his lawn.
</P>
<P>
   In Clute, host of the summer Great Texas Mosquito Festival,
lifelong resident and City Hall employee Sarah Oakes described the
situation as ``just terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you go outside, you're immediately covered with
mosquitoes,'' she said. ``I've been here 48 years and I believe
this is the worst I've seen it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Angleton, Brazoria County Agricultural Extension Agent Bochat
said a number of young calves had died from inhaling mosquitoes.
And adult cattle also are suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two ways cows will respond to clouds of
mosquitoes,'' he said. ``They will either run all day _ run until
they lose so much weight that the rancher sells them. That's
happening now. Or, they'll stand in water. I've seen them stand in
water up to their eyes. That's not a healthy situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad enough?
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M's Olson said he's seen it worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Hurricane Allen (in August 1980),'' he said, ``cattle
were dying in Brazoria County. Calves were choking, but adult
cattle were falling over dead. When we went to check we found there
wasn't a red corpuscle left in their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had been totally exsanguinated.''

IT'S A NEW ERA AS UTILITES SHED REGULATORY SHELLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston Edison Co. is spending $150 million in a joint venture to
offer cable television, telephone, and Internet services in a
direct challenge to the region's established players.
</P>
<P>
   Central Maine Power &UR;  &LR; Co. plans to diversify into natural gas
after it completes the sale of its electricity-generating plants.
</P>
<P>
   And several New England electric utilities are expanding into
areas like home security, energy consulting, and fiber-optic
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   These fledgling ventures all owe their start to a new era of
competition that is reshaping the energy landscape in Massachusetts
and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are interesting times for utility executives, who must
make significant strategic decisions about the future of their
companies,'' said Philip Giudice, a vice president and head of the
utilities consulting practice at Mercer Management Consulting in
Lexington, Mass. &UR;  &LR; ``How you create value in a deregulated
environment for shareholders and customers is much more difficult
and uncertain than it has ever been in the utility industry.''
</P>
<P>
   States that have moved to deregulate their electric utilities
have taken different approaches, but the goal has essentially been
the same: drive prices lower by introducing competition to a market
that has been run by state-monitored monopolies for a century.
</P>
<P>
   Under Massachusetts' deregulation legislation, which took effect
March 1, large investor-owned electric utilities have begun selling
their generating plants to outsiders, which plan to use
consolidation and new technology to produce cheaper power. The old
utilities will continue to maintain the lines that deliver power
for fees that are set by the state, but they are free to enter new
businesses. Shedding their aging coal, oil, and gas plants has
resulted in significant ``downsizing'' _ in employees, revenues,
and profits _ and pressured the companies to find fresh sources of
income.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growth in the wires business is fairly constrained with
limited growth, so if you want to provide shareholders with a
better return, you need to broaden your horizons to new ventures,''
said Arthur W. Adelberg, executive vice president of CMP Group
Inc., the new formed parent of Central Maine Power in Augusta, the
state's largest utility. CMP has targeted the distribution of
natural gas in rural areas for expansion, as well as
telecommunications and energy consulting.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts caution that utilities accustomed to operating under
the cozy protection of state regulation will find it hard to enter
markets where competition is fast and furious. The companies, said
Giudice of Mercer, will need to develop management skills and
corporate cultures that can support quick delivery of products and
services and adjust prices at a moment's notice to stay ahead of
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, their success is far from a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, Boston Edison, a subsidiary of BEC Energy, and
New England Electric System recently sold their nonnuclear
generating facilities to out-of-state buyers. They are still trying
to exploit their expertise in ``wires,'' but the focus is now on
wires for phone, Internet, and cable TV services.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Edison is joining with RCN Corp. of Princeton, N.J., to
string 200 miles of fiber-optic cable connecting 40 cities in
Eastern Massachusetts to provide telecommunications services
normally delivered by telephone carriers such as Bell Atlantic and
AT&AMP;T. Under a five-year agreement, RCN and Boston Edison will each
spend $150 million for the venture, which will compete against
existing cable television services from Cablevision, MediaOne, Time
Warner, and others.
</P>
<P>
   New England Electric System is taking a more conservative
approach to telecommunications. Staying out of the direct sale of
services to residential customers, it will instead provide the
cables and wires on a wholesale basis to voice and data carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know wires, poles, ducts, and how to maintain them 24 hours
a day _ that's our strength, we're very good at it,'' said Richard
P. Sergel, president and chief executive of Westborough,
Mass.-based NEES, the largest utility in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Together with Central Maine Power, Northeast Utilities helped
fund NorthEast Optic Network, or NEON, (originally named FiveCom
Inc.) which plans to link 540 cities with nearly 950 miles of
fiber-optic cable throughout New England and to New York City,
using electric and other utility rights of way.
</P>
<P>
   Pieces of the network have been completed, including
Hartford-to-Springfield and Nashua-to-Portland, with companies such
as MCI Communications and Sprint planning to use the network. In an
initial public offering in late July, NEON raised $48 million and
arranged a $180 million debt offering.
</P>
<P>
   So far results from the stock offering have been mixed. While
NEON hopes to complete the network late next year and has gained
new customers, the stock price, which began at $12 a share, has
sunk to about half, due in part to industrywide concerns of excess
capacity of new wires for telecommunications services.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, not all new ventures succeed. Last month, Boston Edison
said it was bailing out of Energyvision, its 50-50 joint venture to
market natural gas in New England with Williams Cos., a large
energy company located in Tulsa, Okla. The decision reflects Boston
Edison's desire to focus on distribution by wires and cable,
according to Thomas May, chairman and chief executive of BEC
Energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we will no longer be an energy producer, we decided to
exit the energy marketing business, which requires specialized
talent in managing commodity risks,'' said May.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Edison's decision to stick with the RCN telecom venture
and its ``wires'' business contrasts sharply with the region's
largest utility, Berlin, Conn.-based Northeast Utilities. The
company, which controls most of the region's nuclear power
generating facilities and serves customers in Connecticut, New
Hampshire, and Western Massachusetts, sees a different future,
according to Michael Morris, its chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of shedding generating assets, Morris wants to retain
some of NU's electric plants in a separate subsidiary that would
also acquire small equity positions in other companies' power
plants in New England or offer to operate them.
</P>
<P>
   His goal is to make NU a marketer of energy, one that can sell
electricity to business and consumer groups throughout New England.
Morris maintains some of those buyers will want their power
provider to physically own or operate the generating assets as a
hedge against sudden spikes in electricity prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see us having a strategy to bifurcate our energies
into getting into the telephone or cable TV or home security
business like other utilities or just become a wires company,''
said Morris. ``We want to delivery energy throughout the region.''

STREAK OR NO STREAK, BASEBALL'S NOTHING NEW FOR RIPKEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do you happen to know what you were doing a year ago today?
Probably not. Do I? No. But we know what Cal Ripken was doing on
Sept. 24, 1997, because it's the same thing he usually does on a
Sept. 24.
</P>
<P>
   He was playing major league baseball for the Baltimore Orioles,
just as he will be doing Thursday night at Fenway Park in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The only difference now is that his new consecutive game streak
is three.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 24, 1997, was a good day for Ripken and his team. He went
1 for 3 and scored twice as the Orioles officially concluded their
wire-to-wire romp through the American League East with a 9-3
victory over Toronto. It was better than Sept. 24, 1982 (0 for 4
against the Brewers), or Sept. 24, 1992 (0 for 4 against the Blue
Jays), and it might not have been as personally satisfying as Sept.
24, 1990 (10th-inning tie-breaking home run against the Yankees).
Sept. 24 is not exactly his best calendar day, anyway, his career
Sept. 24 totals being .288 (14 for 45), two homers, one double, and
just three runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   April 8, July 4, Aug. 17, Sept. 24 ... for more than 16 years,
it has made no difference. Cal Ripken was going to be there, day
after day, night after night, and, for the most part, inning after
inning _ until last Sunday night. That's when Calvin Edward Ripken
Jr. walked into Baltimore manager Ray Miller's office shortly
before consecutive game No. 2,633 was about to begin and said,
``It's time.''
</P>
<P>
   Economical. Concise. Definitive. With his team out of the
wild-card race and with his fans in attendance at the final home
game of the season, Cal Ripken did it the right way. He pulled the
plug himself on the most celebrated tale of perfect attendance that
American sport has ever known. He got far more attention for not
playing that night than 99 percent of athletes ever get for
playing, but that's what happens when you gradually transform
yourself from a ballplayer into a legend.
</P>
<P>
   One night later, he was back on the job. He had done what it
finally seemed sensible for him to do, and now he could resume his
routine, sort of. Of course, it will never be the same for Ripken
again. Starting next year, you will see Oriole lineups in which
``Ripken, 3B,'' ``Ripken, DH,'' or perhaps even ``Ripken, 1B'' will
not be seen. There might be pinch hitters. There might even be
(gasp) defensive replacements. Ray Miller, or whoever, has been
liberated. He will be able to treat Ripken as a 38-year-old former
star who still has contributions to make but no longer must be
catered to. In a very real sense, Monday was the first day of the
rest of Cal Ripken's athletic life.
</P>
<P>
   But it is utterly ridiculous to suggest that his absence from
the game Sunday night would have any tangible effect on his
performance during what was left of the season. He had a sharp
bounding single through the hole and a double up the gap against
Roger Clemens Monday, after which he suffered through the
predictable ``You-think-the-night-off-helped-you?'' queries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we have enough evidence in to make any judgments
like that,'' he said in a statesmanlike tone.
</P>
<P>
   He was clear-eyed and refreshed, and it seemed as if he was also
amused by the process. He knew he was going to get end-of-streak
questions and he was intrigued by the inquisition.
</P>
<P>
   He had been living with The Streak for so long that it had
become him. On this first day after its conclusion, he was
discovering just how all-encompassing it really was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time will tell about a lot of things,'' he said, ``but I don't
expect to feel anything funny because nothing's really changed. I'm
still talking about it, aren't I?''
</P>
<P>
   It was always understood that the best way for The Streak to end
would be for Cal to end it and thus not make his manager the bad
guy. Cal may be somewhat stubborn, but he is not stupid. He knows
how little range he has left, and he knows that he has been a
largely unproductive hitter (.393 slugging percentage at a ``power
position''). He knew how controversial and volatile an issue it
was, and how there were many people, both inside and outside the
organization, who felt he was being selfish. Fine. He just felt he
had earned the right to settle the issue on his own terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``First I thought I'd end it at the 162d game and then I'd have
the whole offseason to deal with the aftereffect,'' he explained.
``Then I decided it was best to do it at home. But I'm convinced
the timing is right. Now I do have the whole offseason for people
to get over it. Now I can come to spring training, get it all out
of my system, and play baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the famed off day, he found it to be a fascinating
experience, the highlight of which was paying a two-inning visit to
the Orioles' bullpen. He's like everyone else who follows the game
in that he has always heard about the storytelling that goes on in
the bullpen, but he had never experienced it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get an interesting perspective,'' he said, ``one I've
often wondered about. What I found out is that everyone has a
personality down there until the phone rings. They swap stories and
they talk, but when the phone rings, it's a different place. Then
it's time to go to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Work is something Cal knows all about. He learned the value of
hard work from Cal Sr., and having a sense of responsibility about
that work is what The Streak has always been about to Cal Ripken
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always proud of what The Streak represented,'' he
explained. ``It was all about being a part of the team and being
ready to go out there for the team and your teammates every single
day. You want to be there for each other. I just thought of the
streak as me being a `gamer.' That's something very important in
baseball. If some guy's a `gamer,' that's a very high compliment.''
</P>
<P>
   Now in case you're wondering about those tickets you may hold
for Thursday night, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, Cal Ripken Jr.
wants you to know they will be like any other Sept. 24, 25, 26, and
27 he's known for the past 16 years. If there's a game, by God,
he'll be there, ready to go. Ray Miller may have something to say
about it, but Cal Ripken Jr. will present himself, ready for duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' he declared. ``I'm still approaching every day
the same way. I don't expect to sit.''
</P>
<P>
   He named his book ``The Only Way I Know.'' He wasn't kidding.

IT'S NOT A HALL MARK FOR MARIS

<P>
   That's 65. And I didn't want to get too carried away, so I left
a few borderline guys off the list (look up Cecil Cooper sometime).
What these 65 baseball players have in common is that I believe all
of them deserve to be in the Hall of Fame ahead of Roger Maris.
Note I didn't say they all belong in the Hall of Fame, because they
surely don't. But I'd vote for every one of them before I'd vote
for Roger Maris.
</P>
<P>
   (I hear the buzz. Mark Belanger? Hey, Mark Belanger was the best
grass shortstop of the game's first seven decades. I don't care if
he hit .228, or even .128.)
</P>
<P>
   This list doesn't even include Nolan Ryan, George Brett, Robin
Yount, and Carlton Fisk, who are on the ballot for the first time
this year, and Andre Dawson, who isn't eligible yet.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, but someone has to be The Grinch That Stole Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   I can't believe some of the things I've been reading and hearing
on this subject of late. As much as American sportswriters and
broadcasters so often pride themselves on being tough and
skeptical, if not downright cynical, L'Affaire Maris reveals that
underneath the outer layer is an inner core of emotional mush.
</P>
<P>
   People apparently got carried away by seeing Mark McGwire go
into the stands after No. 62 to embrace the Maris family. People
apparently are taken by the sad tale of Maris's treatment during
and after his assault on Babe Ruth's record in 1961. People are, in
some cases, ridden with guilt because they wanted Mickey Mantle to
break the record, not Roger Maris. People are, oh, geez, I don't
know, thinking with their hearts rather than their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Maris was a major leaguer for parts of 12 seasons. He had two
truly outstanding seasons, 1960 and 1961, during which he was so
good he was easily voted the MVP award. He also had a nice season
in 1962 (33 homers, 100 RBIs), and a decent season in 1958 (28
homers, 80 RBIs for Cleveland and Kansas City). As far as numbers
go, that is it.
</P>
<P>
   Career totals: 275 homers, 851 RBIs, .260 batting average.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I know he was a good fielder, perhaps even a very good
fielder, although I suspect his boosters are now exaggerating his
expertise in that area. Yes, he knew how to run the bases, even
though he was a neglible stolen base threat (21 career swipes).
Yes, I know he would have expanded his offensive numbers had he
remained injury-free. But he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, I know he was a very decent man and an exemplary
teammate. Yes, I know he reflected classic Heartland sensibilities
in that he was quiet, genuinely modest, and disdainful of the
limelight. But so what? There is no more reason to put him into the
Hall of Fame for that reason than there is to keep Reggie Jackson
out because he is boastful, boorish, and a self-promoter.
</P>
<P>
   Some say he should be in because he was a two-time MVP. So? Dale
Murphy was a two-time MVP and I wouldn't vote for him, either,
although I'd sure put him in ahead of Maris. What does two-time MVP
have to do with anything? People can flash across the sky with
temporary greatness. Take a look at what Andres Galarraga has done
since 1993. It's pretty damn impressive, but he's not going to
Cooperstown, I can assure you.
</P>
<P>
   If you're going to put Maris in the Hall of Fame because he had
one extraordinary season _ and that is what you'd be doing _ then
you'd also better be prepared to send Smoky Joe Wood in there with
him. Smoky Joe's 1912 ranks with any baseball achievement ever, if
you ask me.
</P>
<P>
   I believe this with all my heart: If I could be anyone in the
history of baseball for one season, I'd choose to be Smoky Joe Wood
in 1912. I'd be 23 years old. I'd be 34-5 with a 1.91 ERA. I'd
throw 10 shutouts. I'd even hit .290. I'd win three games in the
World Series and my team would become champions.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the dead ball era, 34-5 was 34-5. It was as good a year
as any pitcher could ever hope to have. But it didn't get Wood into
the Hall of Fame, and believe me when I tell you that this
pitcher-turned-hitter is a far, far superior candidate than Maris.
</P>
<P>
   Maris deserves to be remembered in some tangible way by the
folks at Cooperstown, but he isn't even close to being worthy of
enshrinement. I agree with my friend Bill Madden of the New York
Daily News when he suggests there be a room, or exhibit,
commemorating special baseball achievements such as Maris's 1961
season, the Harvey Haddix 12-inning perfect game, and all those who
have hit four home runs in a game. But that is as far as it should
go for Maris.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame is far from perfect, and we can all agree that
the standards for entrance are murky, at best. But they are not so
murky that a good-but-not-great ballplayer who has one phenomenal
season and one very nice one should be voted into the Hall of Fame
because he is now regarded as a sympathetic personality.
</P>
<P>
   But if you want to expand Baseball Hall of Fame parameters to
include Maris, go right ahead. Just remember to vote these other 65
guys in first.

DOLPHINS? DEFENSE? THEY GO TOGETHER NICELY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So they whacked out Buffalo and Indianapolis easily the first
two weeks. No big deal. Neither of those teams figure in the AFC
East picture. But after what they did to the Pittsburgh Steelers
last Sunday, the Miami Dolphins have established themselves as the
team for the Patriots to beat in division.
</P>
<P>
   Miami has started 3-0 three of the last four years, but this
year's team is different, and when they meet up with the Patriots
(the first game is Oct. 25), it should be interesting.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins are second in the AFC in defense but 13th _ third
to last _ in offense. Who would have ever thought the day would
come when Miami, with Dan Marino still standing upright, would be
better on defense than on offense?
</P>
<P>
   ``They look very good on defense,'' said Jets head coach Bill
Parcells, who was breaking down some Miami video in preparation for
the Oct. 4 game at the Meadowlands, after the AFC East's bye week.
``This Miami team is very fast on defense. The speed is a big
factor. And they can get after the passer.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells's view of the ``changed'' Dolphins, is supported by
Pittsburgh's director of football operations, Tom Donahoe, who saw
his team whipped, 21-0, by Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have changed it around,'' said Donahoe. ``It doesn't look
like the same team. In the second half of our game, they threw just
a handful of passes. They play very conservative on offense. They
do not want to turn the ball over, so they stay basic.
</P>
<P>
   ``On defense they have a lot of speed. They move (Jason) Taylor
around and have him rush the passer from different spots.
(Karim-Abdul) Jabbar gained 100 yards against us, but he ran it 35
times, so it wasn't that they moved the ball on the ground against
us. Their plan seems to be, don't turn the ball over and make plays
on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots figured to have the best defensive team in the AFC
East this year, but right now Miami is outdoing them in every
defensive category. The Dolphins, traditionally not a big
pass-rushing team, already have 13 sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Miami will be tested in its next two games _ road contests
against the Jets and Jacksonville, while the Patriots will play in
New Orleans and at home against Kansas City. Then they'll meet in
Miami.
</P>

   You missed a great show if you didn't see Deion Sanders dazzle
the Giants in New York Monday night. Dallas special teams coach Joe
Avezzano, who was caught by TV cameras time and again smiling with
delight and amazement, said, ``This is what is great about the NFL.
It gives a stage to the greatest athletes, and this guy always
seems to sense when it is prime time. I love it whenever we have a
nationally televised game because Deion is a marvel. At times I
know what it must be like to be an assistant coach of the Chicago
Bulls and watch Michael Jordan do all those great things that other
guys can't do. Deion is like that. He is the fastest football
player I have ever seen. He runs as fast as he needs to run. On the
punt return for a touchdown in that game'' _ on which Sanders ran
backwards and sideways, before exploding down the sideline _ ``he
ran just as hard as he had to, and then when he needed it, he gave
it a burst and went past everyone. He looks to go all the way every
time he touches the ball. And he doesn't always go where we have
the return on. But I don't say anything. He's so special, you would
never try to overcoach him. This is the all-time leading scorer in
this league for a guy who doesn't play offense. He's made more
points on defense and returns than any other guy.'' In addition to
the 59-yard punt return, Sanders ran back an interception 71 yards
for for a score.

   The Patriots are awaiting results of an MRI linebacker Chris
Slade had Tuesday. Slade has been complaining of a sore knee, and
there was some swelling after Sunday's win over Tennessee. Ferric
Collons is listed as day to day with an ankle injury. Other than
that, they are supposed to be healthy ... The Bills are struggling.
New quarterback Rob Johnson hasn't finished two of the three losses
because of concussions; the offensive line has give up 22 sacks;
and Bruce Smith has been invisible. Smith, the best defensive
player in the league in recent years, is still favoring his right
knee after offseason surgery. Smith, who rushes from the right
side, says he can't push off with that knee the way he did when he
blew past left tackles ... Older is better for quarterbacks. The
five oldest starters in the league right now are Warren Moon, Dan
Marino, John Elway, Steve Young, and Randall Cunningham. They have
yet to lose a game ... Bad news for the rest of the league: Green
Bay general manager Ron Wolf says the Packers defense this year is
every bit as good as the one that won the Super Bowl two years ago.
The stats back him up, too: Green Bay is No. 1 in total defense.
Cincinnati, which is supposed to be good on offense, had just seven
first downs at home Sunday vs. the Pack, and a total of 28 yards
rushing.

AT LAST, AN IVY HALL OF THEIR OWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Donna de Varona _ Olympic gold medalist, Title IX activist,
Women's Sports Foundation co-founder, television sportscaster _
hears herself called a pioneer, her first reaction is only natural.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should be older,'' chuckles the 51-year-old, who, like
tennis legend Billie Jean King, Olympic leader Anita DeFrantz, and
a handful of others, turned a career as an athlete into a lifetime
of activism on behalf of women who want to play sports.
</P>
<P>
   And her second reaction? ``I'm thrilled about it,'' says the
two-time Olympic swimmer. ``It's a wonderful opportunity to talk
about how far women have come and what we have to do to protect our
future.''
</P>
<P>
   De Varona received the Pioneer Award this week from the New
England Women's Fund, an organization dedicated to increasing
athletic opportunities for women and girls in the region, at its
first Women's Sports Award reception. (Eds.: Event was Wednesday,
9/23.)
</P>
<P>
   Also honored were sports broadcaster Robin Roberts of ESPN and
ABC, winner of the Media Award; and the 1998 US women's Olympic ice
hockey team. Several team members, including Colleen Coyne, Sandra
Whyte, Tricia Dunn, and A.J. Mleczko, attended the event.
</P>
<P>
   A highlight of the evening was the induction of 11 women into
the first class of the New England Women's Sports Hall of Fame.
Already announced are golfer Jane Blalock and baseball pioneers
Mary Pratt and Maddie English; the rest of the winners will be
unveiled tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many unsung heroes in women's sports,'' says de
Varona, for whom the limelight came early and still shines.
``They've proven themselves but they're just now getting the
recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   As a 13-year-old, de Varona was the youngest member of the US
swimming team at the 1960 Olympics in Rome. By the end of 1964, she
had broken 18 world records and won two gold medals, in the
400-meter freestyle and 400-meter relay at the Games in Tokyo,
after which she was voted Most Outstanding Female Athlete in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, she began a career in broadcasting, during which
she has also served on presidential commissions, as a co-founder of
the Women's Sports Foundation, and as a leading advocate of the
Title IX legislation, passed in 1972, that prohibits sex
discrimination in sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We chose her because she really demonstrates what the purpose
of the Pioneer Award is all about in that she has broken through a
number of glass ceilings,'' says Ann Sanders, executive director of
the New England Women's Fund. ``And she just keeps on doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   What she's doing now _ chairing the organizing committee for the
1999 Women's World Cup _ would itself be enough to put her in the
Hall of Fame if it unfolds as planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an opportunity that transcends sport,'' says de
Varona, who warmed up by serving on the board of directors for the
1994 men's World Cup. ``Lots of people don't understand what this
means worldwide. There are so many women out there who want to play
sports, and this will be televised to 70 countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people in those soccer-mad countries, including some who
still frown on women's involvement, will see women competing at the
highest level for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``These images will be played out globally,'' says de Varona,
relishing the thought. ``This can be the most important event in
women's sports history.''

COMMENTARY: BEYOND MONICA  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Forget the Hot Stove League blather about
extraconstitutional deals, of censures and fines, or of a quickie
impeachment vote. And let's cut the hand-wringing about how awful
all this is, too much for the children to take, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Recall the classic New Yorker cartoon by Robert Day of the man
trying to fix a tire in a rainstorm, saying to his kids in the car:
``Don't you understand? This is LIFE, this is what is happening. We
CAN'T switch to another channel.''
</P>
<P>
   Real life is the coming Resolution of Inquiry by House
Judiciary. Serious new digging will begin. If the voters elect a
Republican House on Nov. 3, the next Congress will hold hearings,
draw up articles of impeachment and vote on them, probably in the
spring.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution should not be limited to the president's
unrelenting perjury in the Lewinsky affair. That may well be a high
crime against the judicial system, but I think no consensus for
removal will be formed around lying under oath about one case of
illicit sex, even by a chief executive with a young employee.
</P>
<P>
   We must have more from the independent counsel about other
crimes: Whitewater, Travelgate and Filegate abuses of power. We
need to know all Ken Starr knows, and then Congress will dig deeper
into leads his investigation provides.
</P>
<P>
   A minor example is the French farce at the White House gate the
day President Clinton was informed Monica Lewinsky had been called
as a witness. She came to see him that Saturday morning, Jan. 6; as
a frequent visitor, she winkled out of a guard the infuriating fact
that her Handsome was not with his lawyers, as claimed, but was
seeing a woman she took to be a romantic rival.
</P>
<P>
   After she raised a rumpus, an angry president wanted an officer
fired for letting Monica know the identity of his visitor. After
the guilt-ridden Clinton cooled down, the gatekeepers were told
``what happened never happened.'' The Secret Service director was
kept in the dark about the president's dismaying dressing-down of
his men.
</P>
<P>
   That offense, though rank, is not impeachable. But Congress will
be obliged to examine in detail the president's slanderous attack
on Kathleen Willey in his sworn testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Here was a mature woman of good repute who reluctantly revealed
a groping pass Clinton made at her in the Oval Office when she
applied for a job. The president not only denied all (as at first
with Monica, and Paula, and Gennifer) but, under oath, charged Ms.
Willey with lying to the grand jury. He intimated that she first
made a move on him with his sly ``She was always very friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Willey is a citizen of the United States who has been
branded a perjurer by her president, whom she dared to say
manhandled her unlawfully. Because she has no DNA evidence to prove
him lying, White House operatives and hired snoops are eager to
join their boss in trashing her further. But if her charge is true,
this serious harassment has just been escalated by Clinton to
potential perjury with intent to injure. Congress will not avert
its eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Once the main stream of inquiry begins to flow, tributaries in
related Congressional investigations will feed it. The Resolution
of Inquiry should cover the long abuse of executive privilege in
the House Oversight Committee's campaign finance investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Reno's refusal to share more of the suppressed
Freeh and La Bella memos may figure in the coming inquiry; this
includes information that might help Congress tie the president to
potentially illegal fund-raising with James Riady, John Huang and
Charlie Trie. Also, the Judiciary Committee could put impeachment
pressure into a demand for information Justice has about espionage
connected to corrupt Commerce Department approvals of technology
transfers to China, but refuses to divulge to the ultra-secret
Chinagate select committee.
</P>
<P>
   The preceding convoluted paragraph has a bunch of reporting
behind it and may be worth reading again, keeping in mind that
Congress' impeachment power can overcome ordinary
separation-of-power barriers to investigation.
</P>
<P>
   This has to go beyond Monica to show some pervasive pattern of
abuse. For all the Clinton chickens coming home to roost, Congress
must build a large coop.

STUDENT'S TIP HELPS IN DISCOVERY OF NEW PLANETS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Hawaii, Calif., Australia, Britain)  (lb) 
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A university sophomore in England, corresponding by e-mail,
volunteered some carefully considered advice to the two American
astronomers with a knack for finding planets around other stars
beyond the solar system: They should focus their planet search on
30 overlooked sunlike stars and they might score more discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   The astronomers agreed to have a look with the powerful Keck
Observatory telescope in Hawaii. Sure enough, orbiting one of the
student's candidate stars, 154 light-years away in the
constellation Cygnus and designated HD187123, is a planet the size
of Jupiter, which is the largest planet of the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   The new planet is closer to its host star than any planet found
before, so close that a year on the blue-violet sphere _ the time
of a full orbit of the star _ is only three days.
</P>
<P>
   The new planet was one of two such discoveries announced
Wednesday by Dr. Geoffrey Marcy of San Francisco State University
and Dr. Paul Butler, formerly of the same institution but now at
the Anglo-Australian Observatory near Sydney, Australia. The
detections bring to 12 the number of planets discovered beyond the
solar system, all in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Marcy and Butler are responsible for nine of the discoveries,
but they made a point of sharing credit for the most recent one
with Kevin Apps, an astrophysics student at the University of
Sussex in England.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used the latest satellite data and sifted out the stars
that would have the best likelihood of harboring planets,'' Marcy
said. ``It's great to have him as a colleague.''
</P>
<P>
   The other newly discovered planet, also about the size of
Jupiter, was detected around HD210277, a star that is 68
light-years away in the direction of the constellation Aquarius. It
is the first of the extrasolar planets that appears to have an
Earth-like orbit.

SENATE OK'S MORE RESTRICTIVE PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY MEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Americans piling up debts and banks earning
billions of dollars in the process, the Senate voted 97-1 Wednesday
to make it tougher for many people to use bankruptcy laws to escape
their unpaid bills.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate legislation, which differs in key ways from a House
bill that is harder on consumers, comes amid a debate over who is
at fault for the nation's explosive rise in bankruptcies.
</P>
<P>
   Lenders say the current bankruptcy laws are too lax, encouraging
people to overspend with the knowledge that a judge will wipe out
their debts. They also blame rising home prices, which have forced
people to juggle high mortgage payments at the same time they use
credit cards as a way to borrow money.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the credit industry has flooded the nation with
credit card solicitations _ an estimated 30 for every American
family last year. They say the proposed legislation, by making to
easier for credit companies to win repayment, would only encourage
lenders to offer even more credit cards to people who cannot pay
their bills, causing an increase in bankruptcies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the problem is the number of over-extended consumers, the
bankruptcy bill is likely to make matters worse,'' said Lawrence M.
Ausubel, an economics professor at the University of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved its version of bankruptcy overhaul in June,
but there it may never get the chance to iron out its differences
with the Senate. Responsiblity falls to the judiciary committee in
each chamber, and the House committee is now consumed with
independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report on President Clinton's
relations with Monica S. Lewinsky. Congress is aiming to adjourn on
Oct. 9.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration favors the Senate version, with
certain conditions, and strongly opposes the House bill.
</P>
<P>
   Amid a booming economy, a record 1.4 million people filed for
bankruptcy last year, a 19 percent increase from 1996 and a 130
percent jump from 1988.
</P>
<P>
   During debate Wednesday, some senators said blame for the
increase rested squarely with the credit card industry. There are
more than 1 billion credit cards in circulation, or about a dozen
for every US household.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1992 and 1996, credit card companies offered about $1
million in credit to every family in the country, said Senator
Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). She said companies were so eager to
sign up borrowers that they sent solicitations to the sons of one
of her staff members, ages 12 and 15. The youngest, a Star Trek fan
with no income other than his $25 per month allowance, was offered
a ``Star Trek Platinum-Plus MasterCard.''
</P>
<P>
   Current law allows people to file under Chapter 7 or Chapter 13
of the bankruptcy code. In Chapter 7, a person's assets are
typically liquidated to pay off some creditors, but judges commonly
eliminate any outstanding debt. In Chapter 13, debtors must sign
onto a repayment plan that typically forces them to pay off their
bills over a three- or five-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Chapter 7 is far more popular, but both the House and Senate say
that it is being abused by people to escape bills that they have
the ability to repay. Amid heavy use of the Chapter 7 laws, judges
discharged $40 billion in debts last year in consumer bankruptcies,
the equivalent of $400 per US household, said William Binzel, a
lobbyist for MasterCard International.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bad deal for consumers,'' Binzel said, ``because
when debts are discharged, they don't simply disappear. The cost is
passed to other consumers in higher prices for goods and services
and higher interest rates.''
</P>
<P>
   The House bill would bar Chapter 7 and require a Chapter 13
repayment plan for people who could pay 20 percent of their debts
over five years.
</P>
<P>
   The more lenient Senate version would force fewer people to file
under Chapter 13. Under its bill, creditors could petition a judge
to require Chapter 13 if a debtor could pay 30 percent of his or
her debts.
</P>
<P>
   Both the House and Senate provisions would apply only in cases
where debtors earn more than the US median family income, or close
to $52,000 a year for a family of four.
</P>
<P>
   Both chambers passed the bill by wide margins, creating momentum
for a resolution. The House vote was 306-118, and the sole
dissenter in Wednesday's Senate vote was Paul Wellstone, a
Minnesota Democrat. Senators John Glenn (D-Ohio) and John Warner
(R-Va.) did not vote.
</P>
<P>
   In Senate debate Wednesday, one of the most heated issues was
whether a person should be able to protect his or her home in
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   That question is currently answered by state law, which varies
widely. In some states, a person's home is commonly liquidated in
bankruptcy to pay debts, while Texas and Florida allow debtors to
keep their homes, no matter the value. &UR;  &LR; The Senate bill would allow
debtors to keep no more than $100,000 in home value.
</P>
<P>
   The current law ``allows too many debtors to keep their luxury
homes, while their legitimate creditors . . . get left out in the
cold,'' said Senator Herb Kohl (D-Wisc.) For example, Kohl said,
former baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn ``fled to a new $1 million
home in Florida'' after his law firm went bankrupt with $100
million in debts.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would not affect the $100,000 cap that applies
in most Massachusetts bankruptcies. But it would penalize the
state's senior citizens, who are entitled to keep an additional
$100,000 in home value.
</P>
<P>
   The higher cap for seniors was intended to protect those who
saved for retirement by paying down their mortgages rather than by
putting money into retirement plans, said Elizabeth Warren, a
Harvard University law professor. Most retirement plans are
protected in bankruptcy proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   However, Warren and others said the Senate had taken some steps
toward helping consumers by reining in abuses credit card
companies. For example, several companies have acknowledged in
recent years that they were illegally aggressive in pushing
consumers to repay debts while in bankruptcy. The Senate bill
imposes fines on companies that break the rules on repayment, and
it requires some repayment plans to be approved by bankruptcy
judges.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Senate would require credit card companies to
disclose how many months it would take to pay off a balance at the
minimum monthly payment, and what the total payments would be,
including interest. Supporters of the provision claimed that it
would take 34 years to pay off a $2,500 credit card loan using
minimum payments and average credit terms.
</P>
<P>
   But Binzel, of MasterCard, said few people paid only the minimum
for an extended time. ``The expense of making these calculations
and puting them on the statement is going to be significant, and it
provides little benefit to consumers,'' he said.

COMMENTARY: A DREADFUL POKER GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Republicans didn't know how to play their hand. They had the
videotape, which was the equivalent of, say, two pairs, or maybe
three of a kind. But they got all excited and bet as if they had
four aces.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton was on the other side of the table doing what he
does best. Surviving. The public viewed the videotape with a
collective shrug of its shoulders. Bill Clinton reached for the
pile of chips and pulled them to his side of the table.
</P>
<P>
   So the dreadful poker game in Washington continues.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand you have a president who is so reckless and
untrustworthy he is not fit to hold the office. On the other you
have a Republican Party, dominated by a snarling, vicious pack of
right-wingers, that is willing to do almost anything to seize
complete control of the government.
</P>
<P>
   There is not a statesman in sight. Much of the important
business of the nation is going untended. The public wants the
crisis resolved but neither side seems willing to take any of the
important steps that might lead to a timely resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The president not only lied to a federal grand jury, thus
handing his enemies a potentially legitimate impeachment issue, but
he continues to lie. And Newt Gingrich, who has taken over the
impeachment process and turned it into a hanging party, made clear
Wednesday that he would be happy to drag the process out for a
long, long time.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, an ethical basket case who has proved to be even more
reckless with the reins of government than Clinton (and who would
like to be president himself), said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand how people can rush to a solution before
they finish the investigation. I just think there's an awful lot we
don't know yet and there's an awful lot of evidence that hasn't
been gathered yet, and that people need to allow the process to go
forward in an orderly manner and not assume that they know what the
final outcome will be either way.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich and his blatant partisanship come hard on the heels of
the terminally prurient Kenneth Starr. Bill Clinton has always been
blessed with the best of enemies.
</P>
<P>
   What we have here is a sick situation. The country would be
better off if Clinton were not the president, but as Bob Dole said,
``I don't see anybody packing over there.'' And the voters, quite
rightly, don't want the likes of Kenneth Starr and Newt Gingrich
determining who can or can't stay in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have a habit of overplaying their hands. When
the party took control of Congress in 1994 it managed to come to
the crazy conclusion that the nation had voted for a right-wing
revolution. And Gingrich found himself soundly ridiculed the
following year when he let it be known that he had allowed a
perceived snub on the presidential jet to play a role in a budget
crisis that led to a government shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   There is no one to honestly root for in this sordid drama.
Clinton, with his lies and his deceptions, his twisted values, his
recklessness and incredible self-absorption, in effect treats
everyone, even his closest aides and advisers, the way he treated
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr is a nightmare out of Kafka. And Gingrich, who now
holds center stage, is no more fit to hold high public office than
the man he presumes to judge.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Starr and Gingrich is the rest of the Republican Party.
It's a party of dangerous extremes that at times has given aid and
comfort to the militia movement and the National Rifle Association,
has tried to undermine popular programs like Medicare, Medicaid and
Social Security, has pushed policies that are anti-urban,
anti-poor, anti-women, anti-gay and anti-consumer, and has
consistently favored the interests of the very wealthy and the
great corporations over those of ordinary working men and women.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps now the public will see clearly the essential
meanspiritedness that runs like a virus through much of the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   As for Clinton, instead of laying the groundwork for America's
advance into the 21st century, he is trying to work out a plea
bargain, like a defendant in Criminal Court.
</P>
<P>
   His best hope is the GOP. There is a case to be made against
Bill Clinton, but it can't be made by a partisan mob.

TYSON GIVEN MENTAL TESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Mike Tyson underwent several hours of psychological and
neurological tests at Massachusetts General Hospital Wednesday to
determine his mental fitness to return to boxing, a question the
state of Nevada wants answered before it decides whether to grant
him a license to fight again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to do the best we can to help provide the answer
to that question,'' said Dr. Ronald Schouten, who heads MGH's law
and psychiatry program and is overseeing Tyson's comprehensive
work-up, required by the Nevada Athletic Commission.
</P>
<P>
   While Schouten could not talk about details of the exams or when
results might be in, he said, ``We're putting together a complete
evaluation, like any evaluation involving the ability of people to
return to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very sensitive matter, so we're being very careful
about confidentiality,'' added Schouten, who is board-certified in
both psychiatry and neurology and served as an expert witness in
the case of John Salvi, the abortion clinic gunman.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson lost his boxing license on July 9, 1997, after twice
biting Evander Holyfield's ear during a heavyweight title fight. He
has also served a prison sentence for rape.
</P>
<P>
   In recent hearings seeking reinstatement before both New Jersey
and Nevada regulators, Tyson has presented psychological evidence
supporting his ability to reenter the ring. For instance,
psychologist Bert Rotman told New Jersey regulators Tyson was a
``big teddy bear. He has a side of him that is warm and
sensitive.'' Rotman based that assessment on an hour interview with
the boxer.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nevada commission, which held a six-hour hearing on
Tyson's reinstatement request Saturday, wanted a more thorough
review. That's why it has asked the MGH team to perform such tests
on Tyson as an MRI of the brain, an EEG, a comprehensive drug
screen, and a battery of neuropsychological exams, said Dr. Edwin
``Flip'' Homansky, chairman of the medical advisory board to the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we expect from the team that will be evaluating him is a
team approach to Mike, his cognitive abilities and his
psychological abilities, and his ability to go back into the
ring,'' said Homansky.
</P>
<P>
   The commission gave Tyson a choice of three institutions at
which to undergo the exams, and he chose MGH, arriving there
Wednesday morning and leaving by about 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Such exams, more thorough than the commission usually requires
of boxers, are necessary given the circumstances surrounding
Tyson's request for reinstatement, Homansky said. ``The only reason
we're going to this effort, to ask Mr. Tyson to do this, is because
we think it's best for him and best for the state of Nevada,'' said
Homansky.
</P>
<P>
   The Nevada commission is also requiring the MGH team to examine
the videotapes of Tyson during his fight with Holyfield, his
postfight interviews, and his license reinstatement hearings in New
Jersey and Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   In preliminary conversations with Schouten Wednesday, Homansky
said, ``He seems just as concerned as we are about what is going to
be best for Mike Tyson.''
</P>
<P>
   While Tyson's lawyers want the athletic commission to grant him
a boxing license by Oct. 3 _ which would require the MGH team to
forward its report to the commission by Monday _ Homansky said the
commission has given the medical team as much time as it needs to
do a thorough review.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time line is Mr. Tyson's attorneys', not ours,'' Homansky
said. ``We're more concerned that this be done right.''

MOTOROLA WINS $337 MILLION NAVY CONTRACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSALE, Ariz. - Motorola's communications division in
Scottsdale has won a contract with the Navy that stands to exceed
$337 million for a radio touted as a ``computer at your
fingertips.''
</P>
<P>
   The magic is that the radio is reprogrammable so it can send
voice, data and video over a wireline or wireless path. With a few
software commands, users can change the radio's bandwidth,
modulation, security and waveforms.
</P>
<P>
   And the portable gadget works with all existing military radios,
allowing it to replace nearly a dozen incompatible ones. Other Navy
radios only work with similar models.
</P>
<P>
   The electronics giant, which has its roots in radio technology,
is looking at marketing the product to police stations, paramedics,
private business and others.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 workers with Motorola Systems Solutions Group spent
three years developing the Digital Modular Radio under a $30
million project for the Navy. Now, the Navy has awarded Motorola a
five-year ``indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity'' contract for
the 40-pound digital device.
</P>
<P>
   If the Navy exercises all its options, the contract is expected
to exceed $337 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy contract comes at a time when Motorola is planning
substantial layoffs, cutting back and delaying projects. Its
problems have been caused, in part, by the Asian economic crunch.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Navy should save time and money with the Motorola
radio that offers greater flexibility and less down time during
dangerous battle situations. The current alternative to a
programmable radio is replacing the system hardware.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's analogous to having a computer at your fingertips,'' said
Erling Rasmussen, corporate vice president and general manager of
the Information Security Solutions and Products Division.
</P>
<P>
   If you want it to perform an entirely different function . . .
you re-program it, or purchase a new program . . . you don't have
to go purchase a new computer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The radio also will let different branches of the military
communicate with each other, something that's been a long-standing
problem since each service uses different frequencies, bandwidths,
and waveforms. &QL;

LOTUS OFFERS MESSAGING SOFTWARE DISCOUNTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANN MULLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its latest bid to fend off competition from Microsoft Corp.,
Lotus Development Corp. is expanding a discount offer on its
messaging software to entice users of any competing e-mail system
to upgrade to Lotus Notes or Domino.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Lotus had begun offering software
subscription discounts to users of its older cc:Mail messaging
software as an incentive to upgrade to Lotus Notes.
</P>
<P>
   The expanded offer, which provides discounts of more than 30
percent, applies to customers with licenses for competing products
such as Microsoft Mail, Microsoft Exchange, Novell Groupwise,
Banyan Mail, and several others.
</P>
<P>
   ``By extending the Lotus messaging upgrade program to all other
messaging platforms, we are delivering on our mission to make it
easy and cost-effective for users to upgrade their messaging
systems to Lotus' innovative messaging, collaborative, and Web
application products, as well as making aggressive moves to further
our growth and market leadership,'' said Eileen Rudden, senior vice
president of Lotus Communications Products.
</P>
<P>
   Since its introduction of Notes in 1989, and its subsequent
release of a server-based product, Domino, Lotus has dominated the
market for ``groupware'' _ software that allows distant workers to
collaborate on a single project or document.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft, which launched Exchange two years ago, is quickly
gaining. According to the most recent industry estimates, Lotus has
sold about 25 million copies of Notes, compared to 16 million
copies of Microsoft Exchange sold.
</P>
<P>
   Lotus has insisted it will stay ahead of Microsoft because Notes
provides more collaborative features than Exchange, which is used
mostly for messaging and group scheduling. While Lotus officials
acknowledge that some customers have chosen Exchange over Notes for
basic messaging, they still rely on Notes for more sophisticated
applications.
</P>
<P>
   But the latest price cuts on its basic messaging software are a
sign that Lotus is feeling the pressure from Microsoft, which folds
Exchange, for little or no cost, into its Microsoft Office software
suite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, the battlefield is really on the messaging front.
Obviously, Exchange is coming right at us with just e-mail, but is
promising more stuff later,'' said Glenn Matsuda, director of
messaging product marketing for Lotus.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Stan Sorensen, lead product manager for Exchange,
said his company is not likely to respond to Lotus' price cuts with
discounts of its own. ``We don't see a compelling need to reduce
what we see as an already very low price,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Dr. Michael Westerman, 29, a resident in internal
medicine at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, was catching up
with one of his patients, 72-year-old John Foltz. Foltz, who has
emphysema and heart disease, told the doctor he had not had a
cigarette in a month, and was breathing better, though climbing the
stairs to his apartment was still a trial.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing remarkable about the conversation except that
it took place in Foltz's apartment and, in this era of managed care
and 15-minute check-ups, it went on for nearly an hour.
</P>
<P>
   House calls are one aspect of the cutting-edge training in
geriatrics required of all residents in internal medicine at
Hopkins Bayview Medical Center _ part of a growing effort at a
handful of medical schools around the United States to meet what
experts say is an urgent need for doctors properly trained in the
problems and the process of aging.
</P>
<P>
   With the rapidly growing number of older Americans _
particularly those who are over 85 and frail _ there is a shortage
of more than 13,000 doctors trained to treat them, according to a
1996 study by the Alliance for Aging Research. And there is an even
greater need for geriatric expertise among internists and general
practitioners, whose caseload will become increasingly elderly in
the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   It is one more example of the profound impact of the country's
aging population, and of how unprepared the health-care and
social-welfare systems are to handle it.
</P>
<P>
   Though house calls are only one aspect of the immersion in
geriatrics, they are central to the Hopkins Bayview focus on
changing the attitudes of medical professionals toward older
patients. Medical school introduces students to the elderly
primarily as frail, acutely ill patients in hospitals. Through
house calls, residents meet older people who are independent and
even vigorous, despite chronic, age-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``House calls teach the real humanity of medicine,'' said Dr.
John Burton, director of the division of geriatric medicine and
gerontology at the Hopkins School of Medicine. ``Suddenly, the
residents aren't the benevolent dictator. They're the invited
guest.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hopkins Bayview geriatrics training program, along with a
handful of similar ones at other medical schools around the United
States, is part of a growing effort to meet what experts say is an
urgent need for doctors properly trained in the problems and the
process of aging.
</P>
<P>
   With the rapidly growing number of older Americans _
particularly those who are over 85 and frail _ there is a shortage
of more than 13,000 doctors trained to treat them, according to a
1996 study by the Alliance for Aging Research.
</P>
<P>
   There are 8,800 physicians certified in geriatrics, according to
the American Geriatrics Society. The United States will need 36,000
physicians with geriatrics training by 2030 to care for about 76
million older Americans, according to the society. Students
entering medical school today can expect that at least half of the
patients they will see as doctors will be over 65, according to the
Alliance for Aging study.
</P>
<P>
   ``With frail old people, there's just no margin for error,''
said Dr. David Solomon, a geriatrician who helped found the highly
regarded geriatrics program at the University of California at Los
Angeles School of Medicine. And, he said, with the lack of trained
doctors, ``lots of errors are made.''
</P>
<P>
   Common errors include prescribing inappropriately high doses of
medicine, or failing to recognize symptoms of heart attacks like
confusion or shortness of breath that often appear in elderly
patients, particularly in women.
</P>
<P>
   Untrained doctors might not recognize dementia, which puts an
older patient at risk for a dangerous acute delirium after surgery,
or during an infection like pneumonia. They might not know that
urinary incontinence, which is relatively common among people over
65, can usually be easily managed. They routinely miss depression,
or write it off, wrongly, as an inevitable disease of old age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes doctors will call me, embarrassed, late at night to
ask for help with their own mothers,'' said Dr. Robert Butler, who
in 1982 established the first medical school department of
geriatrics, at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the lack of knowledge can be traced to the limited
training in geriatrics offered at medical schools. While they say
the situation is improving, only 14 of 126 medical schools require
students to take a course in geriatrics, according to the 1997-98
Association of American Medical Colleges' curriculum directory,
while 85 offer geriatrics as an elective course.
</P>
<P>
   According to the 1996 Alliance for Aging study, only 3 percent
of recent medical school graduates have taken an elective in
geriatrics. Only three medical schools _ Mount Sinai, the
University of Arkansas and the University of Oklahoma _ have
departments of geriatrics.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the challenge is making room in the overloaded medical
school curriculum, said Donna Regenstreif, a senior program officer
at the John A. Hartford Foundation in New York, which directs its
resources toward the health-care needs of the aging, and in 1995
awarded grants to seven medical geriatrics residency training
programs, including those at Hopkins and UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she added, ``It's very hard to get medical schools to pay
attention. Most people in power in medical schools represent the
status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts in the field say that the need is not so much for large
numbers of geriatricians as it is for training physicians to make
geriatric care part of their practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of older people, including the frail older
people, could get their care from a properly trained generalist
physician,'' Burton said. ``That's what we're trying to do here.''
</P>
<P>
   Few medical students are drawn to geriatrics. The field lacks
the glamour _ and the relatively high salaries that help offset the
burden of medical school debt _ of popular subspecialties like,
say, cardiothoracic surgery. Geriatrics is considered a discipline,
not a specialty. To become a geriatrician, a doctor must complete a
geriatrics fellowship of at least one year, and pass an examination
by a certifying medical board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old people aren't very sexy,'' said Dr. David Reuben, chief of
the geriatrics division at the UCLA School of Medicine, reflecting
the attitudes not just of the medical establishment but of American
society.
</P>
<P>
   Sangeeta Varanasi, 26, a resident at Hopkins Bayview, said she
was one of only three people out of 160 in her class at medical
school, at the University of North Carolina, who was interested in
caring for old people. Her classmates' attitude: ``They'd say,
`Ooh, you're really going into geriatrics?'''
</P>
<P>
   But at Hopkins Bayview, geriatrics is the new frontier. ``It's
so necessary,'' Burton said. ``I get 20 calls a week from people
saying: `Can you get us a geriatrician? Can you refer me to a
geriatrician?' There are 500 slots for every geriatrics fellow.''

MEXICO-UMASS BEGIN TELESCOPE PROJECT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Standing in the shadow of Mexico's highest peak
Wednesday, astronomers and representatives from the University of
Massachusetts joined with Mexican government officials and
researchers to begin construction on the world's largest
millimeter-wave radio telescope.
</P>
<P>
   The Large Millimeter Telescope, a device able to see through
instellar dust to probe the birthplaces of stars and planets, is
being built on Cerro La Negra, a 15,000-foot mountain that lies in
the state of Puebla, about 150 miles east of Mexico City. The site
is about four miles from Pico de Orizaba, the country's highest
point above sea level.
</P>
<P>
   Funding for the $65 million project is coming from the US
government's Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, as well as from Mexican federal and state agencies.
The telescope's operation will be jointly managed by UMass and the
Mexican National Institute for Astrophysics, Optics and
Electronics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only will (the telescope) enable fundamental scientific
advances, but perhaps more importantly it symbolizes the deep
commitment of both Mexico and the US to support exploration at the
frontiers of knowledge,'' said Alfred Serrano, deputy director of
the Mexican National Science Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   With an antenna more than half the size of a football field, the
telescope will enable researchers to capture radio waves that are
hidden from the view of most telescopes. Similar telescopes have
reached deep into the galaxies to detect some of the basic chemical
compunds that make up the amino acids from which living organisms
are built.
</P>
<P>
   ``This telescope will allow us to search for forming, and
already formed, solar observatory systems analogous to our own,''
said F. Peter Schloerb, director of UMass' Five College Radio
Astronomy Observatory at the Quabbin Reservation in western
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Mexico and Massachusetts signed an agreement for
the telescope in 1994. Initially, a bi-national team had hoped that
advances in new composite materials and laser measuring systems
would have allowed them to build an open-air telescope for the
clearest possible view. But since then, designers have decided to
enclose the telescope in a 16-story high protective dome to shield
it from wind and sun.
</P>
<P>
   The project was also delayed slightly because of disputes
between the university and one the companies originally selected to
help design the structure. And the cost of the project _ for which
the state and UMass are contributing a combined $5 million _ has
increased from the original $46 million estimate.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers in Massachusetts and Mexico remain optimistic
that the telescope will be completed by the end of the year 2000.
The design and construction will be led by MAN Technologie, a
German firm, and will include the Cambridge, Mss.-based company
Simpson, Grumpertz and Hager, MIT's Lincoln Laboratory and NASA's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Placing the telescope in Mexico is ideal because of its
proximity to the equator and because it offers night sky
observation better than a US location would, organizers said.
Mexican officials studied several possible sites that offered both
altitude and a comparatively dry climate.
</P>
<P>
   Cerro La Negra, which in English means ``Black Hill,'' lies in
an area that was once the boundary between two Indian communities,
the Cholulas and Costenos, who like many other pre-Hispanic groups
had built their own astronomical observatories, said Felipe Solis,
deputy archeological director at the National Anthropology Museum
in Mexico City.

 BALTIMORE: geriatrics fellow.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With about 12 months of their three-year training period
dedicated to geriatrics, residents spend time treating patients in
a variety of settings, from their homes to a retirement community
to a nursing home at Hopkins Bayview.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, geriatrics goes against the standard medical
model, which focuses on curing disease and extending life. ``A lot
of it is common sense,'' said Dr. Eric De Jonge, a geriatrician on
the staff. ``It's making sure patients don't take too many
medicines, that we don't do harm, that we keep people comfortable
and dignified at the end of life. A lot of it gets lost in the
largely technology-dominated medical training.''
</P>
<P>
   Reuben said: ``Geriatricians are the Labrador retrievers of
medicine. We're warm, fuzzy people.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents at Hopkins Bayview learn that success is not
necessarily measured in dramatic medical procedures. Instead, it
might be getting a patient who has had a stroke from the bed to the
toilet, or maintaining a patient's independence. Or cooling off a
patient's sweltering apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting Foltz over the summer, Westerman discovered that it was
110 degrees inside his apartment. ``I tell you, I could barely
breathe,'' Westerman said. ``Mr. Foltz's weight went way down
because he became so dehydrated.'' His patient, who was once a
hospital orderly, wouldn't even consider going to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Residents are trained to work in teams, with social workers and
geriatric nurses, as well as other doctors. Westerman prevailed
upon a social worker for help, and she found a secondhand air
conditioner for Foltz.
</P>
<P>
   Westerman said he has found his experience at Hopkins so
satisfying that he plans to go into geriatrics.
</P>
<P>
   One of De Jonge's patients is an 81-year-old woman suffering
from severe hypertension, depression, coronary artery disease and
diabetes. ``When she came to me, she was on 14 medications,'' De
Jonge said. ``Her daughter had them all on spread sheets. Over the
last 18 months I've stopped eight of the 14, step by step. It's one
of the most gratifying things I've done, to see this woman become
more alert, more physically independent, her mood improved.''
</P>
<P>
   The discontinued medications included one for Parkinson's
disease that was causing insomnia and hallucinations. ``She came to
me with a Parkinson's disease diagnosis,'' De Jonge said. ``She
didn't have Parkinson's.''
</P>
<P>
   While most teaching hospitals have one or two geriatricians,
Hopkins Bayview has 17 clinical geriatricians on the faculty, and
13 geriatrics fellows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students follow role models,'' said De Jonge, who followed two
of his role models, Burton and another geriatrician at Hopkins
Bayview, Dr. Thomas Finucane, into the field. ``The role models in
medical school are doing the most cutting-edge technology. Medical
schools are usually based at tertiary-care centers dominated by
subspecialists. Each doctor is an expert at taking care of one
organ. In some ways, geriatrics puts the whole person together.''
</P>
<P>
   At Bayview, one of the geriatrician role models is Dr. William
Greenough III who, as the former director of the International
Center for Diarrheal Disease Research in Bangladesh, is world
renowned for his work in dramatically lowering cholera mortality
rates in children.
</P>
<P>
   Greenough, 66, said that when he returned to the United States
from Bangladesh after many years, he decided to focus on older
patients because they had become so neglected as to be ``a
third-world country within the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd much rather be old in a developing country than here,'' he
said the other day, making his rounds on the chronic-care ward at
Bayview with Dr. Joel Bolen, a geriatrics fellow.
</P>
<P>
   Eunice Mitchell, 78, who has been bedridden and on a ventilator
since her spine collapsed from osteoporosis five years ago, lit up
when Greenough walked into her room. They chatted about the latest
romance novel Mrs. Mitchell was reading, and about her love of
dogs. A dog had recently visited Miss Mitchell in the hospital,
Greenough said, courtesy of Pets-on-Wheels.
</P>
<P>
   It is vital that medical residents spend time with patients like
Mrs. Mitchell, Greenough said as he moved down the hallway. ``Mrs.
Mitchell is transformed if only they will listen,'' he said. ``She
does have a life. This is an education for anyone who wants to open
their heart. The human spirit is amazing. You see it here, you see
it in the refugee camps I used to visit.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Bolen, who is 29, he intends to return to his hometown of
Montgomery, Ala., when he completes his one-year fellowship. The
doctor will undoubtedly be busy. ``I'm going to be the first
geriatrician,'' he said.

MOTOROLA OFFERS VOLUNTARY SEVERANCE DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LISA GONDERINGER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Thousands of workers at Arizona's largest private
employer are being given the chance to take a voluntary severance
package before major layoffs begin.
</P>
<P>
   All employees in Motorola's Semiconductor Products Sector, which
employs nearly 13,000 in the Phoenix area, were sent a 10-page
e-mail this week detailing the offer, and for the first time, what
they could expect from the company if they were laid off instead.
</P>
<P>
   It is the latest step in a major restructuring that has been
under way since June, when Motorola announced a plan to cut 10
percent of its worldwide workforce of 150,000.
</P>
<P>
   The internal memo, a copy of which was obtained by ``The
Arizona'' ``Republic,'' urged all workers who think there is any
chance they might be targeted for a layoff to consider the offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want you to understand that the compensation for
involuntary severance for those with more than 10 years of service
will be significantly less than that available through (this
package),'' Brian Bedford, senior vice president and director of
the division's human resources, said in the memo.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola officials say there is no target for how many workers
they hope will take the buyout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to make the offer attractive so as many employees
as possible will feel good about taking it, but there is no set
formula,'' said Stephanie Nowack, director of external
communications for Motorola's Semiconductor Products Sector. ``The
number of involuntary layoffs will be based on how many people
choose to take this.''
</P>
<P>
   The package gives workers with 10 years of service or less one
week of pay for every year they have been with the company. Those
with between 10 and 20 years get two weeks of pay, and those who
have been there more than 20 years get three weeks of pay.
</P>
<P>
   Employees who do not take the package will be considered for the
layoffs. If chosen, they would receive only one week of pay for
every year of service with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola offered an identical voluntary severance package in
June, but only to older workers in the sector whose age plus their
number of years with the company totaled 75. About 1,000 workers in
Phoenix and Austin, Texas, took it.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time the rest of the employees have been given
a chance to take their fate into their own hands.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Motorola is protecting itself from future
lawsuits. Workers who want to take the voluntary severance are
required to sign a general release of any future claims against the
company, and those who are laid off will get an additional four
weeks of pay and two more months of health care benefits if they
sign it.
</P>
<P>
   Those who take the package also will not be allowed to work for
the company, even as a contractor, for at least two years from
their termination date.
</P>
<P>
   Workers have until Oct. 9 to apply for the voluntary package,
and if approved, their last day of work would be between Oct. 10
and 23. Layoffs are expected to begin by the end of October.
</P>
<P>
   Details of how the cuts will play out for the Valley's 20,000
Motorola workers have been seeping out slowly. In June, the company
said it would lay off 15,000 people worldwide _ a majority of them
from the semiconductor division _ as it struggled with slow sales
and sinking profits due in part to the Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   No time frame was given for the layoffs, and because the company
employs 20,000 in the Valley, it was expected that about 2,000 jobs
would be lost locally.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Motorola announced a restructuring plan that included
slashing administrative and overhead costs in the semiconductor
products sector by up to 35 percent and the elimination of one of
its five operating units.
</P>
<P>
   Directors were told to develop plans to significantly trim
administrative and overhead costs. The first surfaced earlier this
month, when the division's support workers, including those in
accounting, human relations and other non-manufacturing,
non-engineering positions, were told that half of their jobs would
be eliminated. They are part of the pool that can now opt to take
the voluntary severance package. &QL;

REVAMPED UMASS TO SHOW OFF AT $10,000-A-TABLE FETE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Just three years ago, it would have seemed unthinkable
that anyone would pay to attend a $10,000-a-table black-tie dinner
benefiting the state's public university.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Thursday night, 1,000 of the state's most well-known
socialites, politicians, sports figures and money-raisers will do
just that, at a gala that could be called a sort of coming out
party for the new University of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence is building with this year's statistics: 145 of the
state's high school valedictorians and salutatorians chose UMass
over private schools, donations are up 77 percent in the last two
years _ lifting them above those at fundraising powerhouse Boston
University. Tuition is down, grade point averages and SAT scores
are up. The flagship campus at Amherst rose 59 rungs in the
widely-watched US News and World Report rankings.
</P>
<P>
   And in perky new television ads prominent alumni such as Bill
Cosby, General Electric Chairman Jack Welch, and Celtics coach Rick
Pitino praise the school as a ``crown jewel'' and the starting line
for a success story. In the most recent ad, an academy award winner
holds his Oscar and declares, ``This looks great next to my UMass
diploma.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by a state board that has aggressively raised standards and
a philosopher-quoting former state Senate president who has
popularized the school as a social and political cause, the
longtime poor cousin to the state's more prominent private schools
is well on its way to completing an image makeover.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm psyched about this,'' said former Gov. William F. Weld,
the host of Thursday's event and the chairman of the university's
fundraising drive. ``I never bought the argument that we should
ignore UMass just because we have Harvard. I think the strategy we
have so far has been just right: focusing on the kids at the top
academic rank, cutting tuition, fundraising.''
</P>
<P>
   Weld, himself a Harvard graduate, as governor hired his former
fundraiser, Peter Berlandi, to raise money for the university, and
appointed Board of Higher Education Chairman James F. Carlin, who
has barreled ahead with raising standards and cutting tuition in
each of the three years since he took office.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even onetime critics admit that much of the credit for the
progress at UMass goes to the man Weld appointed as its president,
former state Senate President William M. Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   With the political and civic connections made in his 17 years in
the Senate, Bulger has made UMass a society cause, toasting it at
gala fundraisers and private art showings that now rank with
evenings out for his other pet causes like the Boston Public
Library and the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Last year's scholarship
dinner _ Thursday night's is the second annual _ coincided with
Bulger's inauguration, and featured so much fanfare that even he
mockingly referred to it as his coronation.
</P>
<P>
   He also hatched the television campaign, getting successful
alums to give soundbite testimonials in ads that wrap up with a
smiling Bulger saying, ``I'm proud to be the president of the
university. Let us be part of your success story.''
</P>
<P>
   The heightened public profile, combined with a law passed just
before Bulger left office that matched every dollar privately
raised with two state dollars, has led to a dramatic increase in
annual donations.
</P>
<P>
   Alumni donations rose last year to $15.5 million, up from $3.7
million in 1995, the year Bulger took over. Overall giving rose to
$62 million last year, up from $25 million in 1993-1994.
</P>
<P>
   Those donations still pale beside those made annually to public
universities in states like Michigan or Wisconsin _ and certainly
next to Harvard, with its $427 million in donations in 1996-1997.
Still, UMass outpaced Boston University the last two years, and in
a state where private schools have long attracted most of the
attention and the money, it was what Bulger calls a ``whole
wrenching change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want to give to a public institution in this
state,'' he said. ``They say `We give through our taxes.' In the
other states, the public institution is it. It has very little
competition, it's the focal point of their pride.''
</P>
<P>
   When Weld named him president in 1995, Bulger was criticized as
almost an insulting choice to head a university in a state that so
values education _ a politician in a post deserving of an academic.
</P>
<P>
   But now, most people would agree that he was the right man at
the right time for a school struggling for recognition in the
public eye and the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Michael Hooker, who left to head the University
of North Carolina's Chapel Hill campus, provoked something of a
``Yeah, sure,'' attitude when he loftily spoke of lifting UMass to
the ranks of UNC or the University of Michigan. He was criticized
for not working Beacon Hill, and didn't have enough public profile
himself to lift the university's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hooker was excellent,'' Weld says. ``Everything he said was
perfect. But Bulger can say less and people will believe him more.
They know he can deliver the meat and potatoes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to try to do fundraising, the first thing you
have to do is friendraising,'' adds Chancellor of Higher Education
Stanley Z. Koplik. ``He has the ability to tell the story of the
university, people know him, they know the name, and he has seized
on that advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Raising more private money has also allowed the university to do
what many said it couldn't: cut tuition at the same time it was
becoming more selective about its students. The Board of Higher
Education set higher admissions standards for the next two years
last week, after raising standards first in 1995. Bulger's
University Scholars program attracted the 145 top two students from
high schools across the state this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, good public relations haven't erased all the problems
at the university's five campuses, or the image problem. In an
episode of the new sitcom ``Costello'' this week, the character
played by Sue Costello (who is from Boston) protested her mother's
talk of her going to UMass: ``Mom, it's like, one step up from
community college!''
</P>
<P>
   And even boosters like Weld say the university still needs to
attract more talent to its academic departments before it can boast
of being the public university the state deserves.
</P>
<P>
   But Bulger, unabashedly the biggest booster, insists much of the
talent has been there all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``The alumni know that what we have been saying about the school
a little more publicly, and with good evidence, is pretty much what
they have been saying on an individual basis,'' he said. ``I don't
think we could get very far saying what we're saying if people
didn't feel this way. I think we've been able to point out a truth:
that the university offers a splendid education that should not be
considered in any way secondary because the price that has to be
paid by the tuition payer is less.''

REALTOR RECOUNTS MOBSTER'S THREATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ First, gangster James ``Whitey'' Bulger poked the crown
of Raymond Slinger's head with the barrel of a gun and explained
there would be little blood if he shot him there. Then, Bulger
ordered a henchman to fetch a body bag.
</P>
<P>
   Slinger, a South Boston Realtor, thought he was dead.
</P>
<P>
   More than 11 years later, the same fear that gripped him then _
and kept him from testifying against Bulger _ returned Wednesday as
he testified in federal court about his run-in with the South
Boston crime boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm less afraid now,'' said Slinger, who has declined FBI
offers to relocate him out of state. ``But I'm still frightened for
myself and my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Slinger's ordeal in the winter of 1987 first became known last
May, in documents about his encounters with Bulger and associates
Kevin O'Neil and Kevin Weeks surfaced during hearings into whether
criminal charges against Bulger's criminal sidekick, Stephen
Flemmi, should be dropped.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday was the first time that Slinger, subpoenaed as a
government witness, told his story under oath in court.
</P>
<P>
   Besides describing the alleged shakedown by Bulger and his
associates _ Slinger said he paid them $25,000 before the FBI began
investigating and O'Neil stopped the payments _ Slinger denied he
told the FBI that he would take the stand against Bulger or wear a
hidden microphone.
</P>
<P>
   His testimony contradicts FBI agent John Newton, who testified
in May that Slinger said he would testify and wear a wire. Newton
suggested that the ``great case'' was dropped because Bulger was a
top-level FBI informant.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Flemmi and his co-defendants _ New England Mafia
boss Francis P. Salemme, Mafia soldier Robert DeLuca and Winter
Hill gangster John Martorano say Newton's testimony shows the FBI
ignored the crimes of its prized informants.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi claims that the bureau promised him and Bulger immunity
from prosecution in exchange for information on the Mafia. Bulger
fled before he was indicted in January 1995 on extortion and
racketeering charges and remains a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Slinger said, he first met Bulger and Flemmi in 1986
when O'Neil brought them to Slinger's East Broadway office to talk
real estate. Six months later, Slinger said, O'Neil called him to a
meeting at Triple O's, O'Neil's family bar on West Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   In a second-floor room, Slinger said, Bulger told him that he
had been hired to kill him. Instead, he said, Bulger offered him a
choice: pay him to kill the person who wanted Slinger dead, or pay
to ``scare him.''
</P>
<P>
   Slinger said he asked Bulger if $1,000 or $2,000 would be enough
for the scare, but Bulger ``said his boots cost more than that,''
and set the price at $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Slinger said he contacted his friend, then-City Councilor James
Kelly, now the council president. ``He said he would try to call a
few people'' for help, Slinger said, but phoned back later and
assured him ``things should be okay.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, Kelly denied he talked to Slinger, but Wednesday he said
he now had a ``very, very vague'' memory of such a conversation.
``He may have said something like that but I didn't believe it and
did nothing with it,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, Slinger said, he was called to another meeting
with Bulger. Though he had a borrowed gun, Slinger said Bulger and
his cohorts took it away, then beat him up. Bulger then threatened
to shoot him through the top of his skull.
</P>
<P>
   Within two months, Slinger said, he had paid a total of $25,000
cash in a series of paper-bagged payments to O'Neil as O'Neil sat
in a car parked outside Slinger's office.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Slinger said, Newton and fellow FBI agent Roderick
Kennedy &UR;  &LR; paid him a visit. Slinger said he rejected their idea to
wear a microphone and testify against Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   Slinger said he immediately called O'Neil to tell him about the
FBI visit. ``He called me back the next day and told me I didn't
have to pay any more money,'' Slinger testified.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The coelacanth, a very rare fish with a pedigree older than the
dinosaurs, has delighted biologists by turning up in Indonesia. Two
of these ugly but fascinating fish have been discovered nearly
6,000 miles from the coast of southern Africa, the only place in
the world where coelacanths had hitherto been found.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery, reported in Thursday's issue of the journal
Nature, kindled hopes that the species might not be quite as
geographically isolated and endangered as was believed.
</P>
<P>
   Until 60 years ago the coelacanth (pronounced SEE-la-kanth) and
all its crossopterygian cousins were believed to have become
extinct some 25 million years before the demise of the dinosaurs,
and these fish were known only from their fossils.
</P>
<P>
   But on Dec. 22, 1938, a fisherman on the Chalumna Bank in the
Indian Ocean off the African coast landed a steel-blue fish about
five feet long, with a paddlelike tail and peculiar ventral fins.
Recognizing his catch as something unknown, the fisherman took it
to a local scientist, and the creature was soon identified as a
coelacanth typical of the early Mesozoic era. Scientists named it
Latimeria chalumnae, and the fish was hailed in headlines around
the world as a living fossil; the discovery of a living dinosaur
could hardly have been more astonishing.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the widespread interest in the coelacanth was the
belief by scientists that crossopterygian fish related to the
coelacanth were the ancestors of amphibians, and hence, of all
tetrapods _ four-limbed creatures _ including human beings. In
recent years, however, comparisons of the DNA of coelacanths with
other animals have convinced most scientists that air-breathing
lung fish rather than the crossopterygians were ancestral to
tetrapods.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1938 several hundred coelacanths have been caught, all in
African waters and most of them near the Comoros Islands. Recent
treaties have banned the intentional hunting of coelacanths, but
they are still occasionally brought to the surface by accident. No
coelacanth has ever survived more than a few hours in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists assumed that some fluke had saved the Comoros Island
coelacanths from the general extinction of crossopterygians 90
million years ago, and that it was unlikely that coelacanths would
be found at any great distance from southern Africa. But on July 30
of this year an Indonesian fisherman named Om Lameh Sonathon and
his crew landed a 64-pound fish some four feet long using a shark
net off the island of Sulawesi.
</P>
<P>
   The fishermen knew what they had, because they were briefed by a
American scientist a year ago. The scientist was Dr. Mark V.
Erdmann, a postdoctoral researcher in biology from the University
of California at Berkeley, who happened to be on his honeymoon in
Indonesia in September 1997. His wife, Arnaz Mehta Erdmann, a
naturalist, was walking through a fish market in Manado when she
spotted a large fish being wheeled along on a hand cart. She
recognized it instantly as a coelacanth.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Roy L. Caldwell, Erdmann's department head at Berkeley, said
in an interview that the Erdmanns were unable to do anything about
their find other than photograph it, because they were scheduled to
return to California on the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you do with a smelly, 80-pound fish when you have to
make a flight?'' Caldwell asked.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the photographs convinced the National Science Foundation,
the Indonesian Institute of Sciences and the National Geographic
Society to finance further investigation by Erdmann, who returned
to Sulawesi and undertook interviews with fishermen near Manado.
Two months ago the search was rewarded when fishermen brought up a
coelacanth. The fish are not good to eat, Caldwell said, because
their oily flesh is strongly impregnated with urea.
</P>
<P>
   The fishermen and Erdmann towed the fish to shore and kept it
alive and swimming for about three hours. When the fish died, it
was frozen for further examination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judging from the fish's external appearance,'' Caldwell said,
``we think it's the same species as the coelacanths caught in the
Comoros, but we can't be sure until we've compared their DNA.''
</P>
<P>
   But all the Comoros coelacanths reportedly were ``steel blue,''
according to their finders, while the Indonesian specimens were
brown, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several commercial organizations and aquariums have tried over
the years to catch coelacanths alive and keep them in tanks. But
the fish are usually injured by hooks, and they appear unable to
stand the changes in temperature and pressure when brought to the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Among the scientists who strongly oppose the intentional hunting
for coelacanths even by scientists is Dr. Hans Fricke of the Max
Planck Institute for Behavioral Psychology in Seewiesen, Germany.
Fricke and his colleagues have made several expeditions in a small
submarine to the coelacanths' habitat off the Comoros and have made
movies recording the peculiar nighttime browsing behavior of the
fish as they search for prey on the ocean bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sante Paabo, a molecular biologist at the University of
Munich who has investigated coelacanth DNA, called the discovery in
Indonesia exciting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indonesia is so far from the Comoros that this must really be
another population of the animals,'' Paabo said. ``That may mean
that coelacanths are not quite as endangered as we feared.''
</P>
<P>
   But Caldwell warned that ``there are probably only a few of
these fish in Indonesia, and the species is certainly still
endangered.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One bad thing about this discovery,'' he added, ``is that
people may get the idea that coelacanths are plentiful and
conservation efforts will weaken. That must not be.''

MEXICO-UMASS BEGIN TELESCOPE PROJECT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Standing in the shadow of Mexico's highest peak
Wednesday, astronomers and representatives from the University of
Massachusetts joined with Mexican government officials and
researchers to begin construction on the world's largest
millimeter-wave radio telescope.
</P>
<P>
   The Large Millimeter Telescope, a device able to see through
instellar dust to probe the birthplaces of stars and planets, is
being built on Cerro La Negra, a 15,000-foot mountain that lies in
the state of Puebla, about 150 miles east of Mexico City. The site
is about four miles from Pico de Orizaba, the country's highest
point above sea level.
</P>
<P>
   Funding for the $65 million project is coming from the US
government's Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, as well as from Mexican federal and state agencies.
The telescope's operation will be jointly managed by UMass and the
Mexican National Institute for Astrophysics, Optics and
Electronics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only will (the telescope) enable fundamental scientific
advances, but perhaps more importantly it symbolizes the deep
commitment of both Mexico and the US to support exploration at the
frontiers of knowledge,'' said Alfred Serrano, deputy director of
the Mexican National Science Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   With an antenna more than half the size of a football field, the
telescope will enable researchers to capture radio waves that are
hidden from the view of most telescopes. Similar telescopes have
reached deep into the galaxies to detect some of the basic chemical
compunds that make up the amino acids from which living organisms
are built.
</P>
<P>
   ``This telescope will allow us to search for forming, and
already formed, solar observatory systems analogous to our own,''
said F. Peter Schloerb, director of UMass' Five College Radio
Astronomy Observatory at the Quabbin Reservation in western
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Mexico and Massachusetts signed an agreement for
the telescope in 1994. Initially, a bi-national team had hoped that
advances in new composite materials and laser measuring systems
would have allowed them to build an open-air telescope for the
clearest possible view. But since then, designers have decided to
enclose the telescope in a 16-story high protective dome to shield
it from wind and sun.
</P>
<P>
   The project was also delayed slightly because of disputes
between the university and one the companies originally selected to
help design the structure. And the cost of the project _ for which
the state and UMass are contributing a combined $5 million _ has
increased from the original $46 million estimate.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers in Massachusetts and Mexico remain optimistic
that the telescope will be completed by the end of the year 2000.
The design and construction will be led by MAN Technologie, a
German firm, and will include the Cambridge, Mss.-based company
Simpson, Grumpertz and Hager, MIT's Lincoln Laboratory and NASA's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Placing the telescope in Mexico is ideal because of its
proximity to the equator and because it offers night sky
observation better than a US location would, organizers said.
Mexican officials studied several possible sites that offered both
altitude and a comparatively dry climate.
</P>
<P>
   Cerro La Negra, which in English means ``Black Hill,'' lies in
an area that was once the boundary between two Indian communities,
the Cholulas and Costenos, who like many other pre-Hispanic groups
had built their own astronomical observatories, said Felipe Solis,
deputy archeological director at the National Anthropology Museum
in Mexico City.

SECURITY COUNCIL TELLS SERBS TO STOP KOSOVO OFFENSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Security Council sent a warning to
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia on Wednesday to stop
Serbian attacks on civilians in the ethnically Albanian Kosovo
region or face international intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Only China did not support the resolution, saying that the
Kosovo crisis was an internal matter for Yugoslavia, which was
acting within its ``legitimate rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, which calls for an immediate cease-fire and the
opening of negotiations between the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav army
and the Albanian separatists of the Kosovo Liberation Army, did not
specify what comes next _ or whether it would be the use of force _
if the Serbs do not comply.
</P>
<P>
   The deliberate ambiguity allowed Russia, which opposes the use
of NATO power in Kosovo, to support the resolution along with the
United States, which argues that NATO already has the authority to
send in a military force.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Lavrov, the Russian representative, said the resolution
was in line with Russia's principles because ``no measures of force
and no sanctions at this stage are being introduced by the Security
Council''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution falls under a section of the U.N. Charter that
gives it military enforcement powers, but Council members said
there are conflicting views on whether another resolution would be
necessary specifically to authorize military action.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine of France, a cosponsor with
Britain of the resolution, called it ``sufficient unto the day'' in
a meeting with reporters Wednesday and deflected a question about
where France stood.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Council should wait to see what happens next before
considering the use of force. He added that NATO had a range of
options at its disposal. Talks among NATO members are also going on
this week in the North Atlantic Council, the organization's
policy-planning arm, but American officials say that this is all
contingency planning, not preparations for war.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Western diplomats said they wanted to deliver a
strong warning. ``The international community's patience is
exhausted,'' Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the British representative
said. ``President Milosevic carries a direct responsibility. If he
ignores those obligations, and continues to pursue military
repression, the international community will respond and will
respond vigorously.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Security Council is putting President Milosevic on notice
that he will be held accountable for his actions,'' he said. ``He
would be wise to take heed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The debate over Kosovo had a familiar ring. When NATO action was
first proposed in Bosnia, it was necessary for Western nations to
deal very carefully with the Russians so that they would not react
negatively to the introduction of European and American troops in
the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   And, as on Iraq, there is a recurring disagreement over how much
authority individual nations or regional organizations have to take
military action without the clear support of the Security Council.
This was a major issue when the United States and Britain began
massing forces in the Persian Gulf last winter in the face of the
obstruction of weapons inspections by Iraq. The issue could arise
again as the Council moves toward another showdown with Iraq in
coming months.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kosovo situation is immediate and critical, with
hundreds dead and more than a quarter of a million people displaced
from their homes, often by Serbian units attacking civilians in
their villages.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's resolution calls on Yugoslavia ``to order the
withdrawal of security units used for civilian repression.''
</P>
<P>
   It also demands that the Albanian opposition leadership in
Kosovo keep humanitarian concerns in mind and ``condemn all
terrorist actions.'' The resolution says that Yugoslavia must allow
``effective and continuous international monitoring'' in Kosovo by
the European Community Monitoring Mission and diplomats based in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   It restates a list of broken promises Milosevic made to
President Boris Yeltsin of Russia in June and demands that these
pledges be honored. These include unimpeded access to Kosovo for
relief organizations, the return of refugees and money for the
reconstruction of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution also calls on all parties to the Kosovo conflict
to cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal for the
former Yugoslavia. Milosevic has ignored requests in the past to
help turn over Serbs wanted by the tribunal for war crimes in
Bosnia and Croatia.

OZAWA SIDELINED FOR OPENING-NIGHT CONCERT  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Seiji Ozawa, knocked out by a viral infection he
contracted in Russia last week and running a temperature of 103.5,
was unable to conduct the opening-night concert of his
25th-anniversary season with the Boston Symphony Orchestra
Wednesday night. Robert Shaw flew in from Atlanta to conduct the
performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony without rehearsal. Shaw
was scheduled to arrive at 4 p.m., meet with the soloists, change
clothes, and then go onstage for the 6:30 concert.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa, music director of the BSO, was scheduled for blood work
at Massachusetts General Hospital Wednesday afternoon. He has
probably not taken a day off since late June. Following his
extensive commitments to Tanglewood and the Tanglewood Music
Center, Ozawa, 63, flew to Japan for the labor-intensive Saito
Kinen Festival. From Japan, Ozawa went to Moscow and St. Petersburg
at the invitation of Mstislav Rostropovich to participate in
concerts intended to encourage detente between Russia and Japan and
the return of the Kurile Islands to Japan. Ozawa arrived in Boston
at 1 a.m. Monday feeling unwell, and immediately called his doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa hopes to recover in time to conduct Sunday afternoon's
free performance of Beethoven's Ninth on Boston Common, an event
that is scheduled to be taped for television.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement read at a press conference Wednesday by Boston
Pops conductor laureate John Williams, Ozawa said, ``It breaks my
heart not to be able to conduct tonight. If there was any way I
could do it, I would, but I am too sick. I apologize to all of you
that I have to cancel. Please know I am doing my best to get well
by Sunday. That concert is my personal thank-you to the citizens of
Boston for all their support of me and the BSO for so many years.
Let's hope for good weather for us _ and the Red Sox. I pray I am
able to thank you all with music soon.''
</P>
<P>
   BSO artistic adviser Anthony Fogg said Emmanuel Villaume, a
young French conductor who had assisted Ozawa during the Saito
Kinen Festival production of Poulenc's ``Les Mamelles de Tiresias''
two years ago, had agreed to fly to Boston to conduct the
all-Berlioz subscription concerts with baritone Jose van Dam Friday
and Saturday nights. Villaume has conducted widely in opera at the
European and American Spoleto festivals, and has had engagements at
Covent Garden, La Scala, the Opera Bastille, the San Francisco
Opera, and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In agreeing to replace Ozawa, Shaw, at 82 the dean of leading
American conductors, was returning a favor. Last summer an ailing
Shaw had to cancel a Tanglewood appearance on short notice, and
Ozawa was one of the three conductors who replaced him. In 1996,
Shaw returned to Tanglewood at Ozawa's invitation after an absence
of 49 years, and in 1997 closed the season with a particularly
memorable account of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, a work he has been
associated with since he prepared the Collegiate Chorale for a
historic performance by Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony in
1945.

<P>
   MIAMI _ As Hurricane Georges approached the eastern tip of Cuba,
the 80,000 residents of the Florida Keys began evacuating their
vulnerable island chain Wednesday and a hurricane watch was issued
for the four million residents of Miami and the rest of southern
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that the storm could become the most ruinous to strike
Florida since Hurricane Andrew in 1992, Gov. Lawton Chiles also
declared a state of emergency for central and southern Florida,
allowing him to mobilize the National Guard. Schools were ordered
closed on Thursday and Friday in Miami-Dade County, and all but
essential county employees have been ordered to stay home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other evacuations, from Palm Beach to Tampa Bay, could start
tonight or Thursday morning,'' depending on the course the storm
takes, the Florida Department of Community Affairs warned in a
statement late Wednesday afternoon. At the same time, the National
Weather Service predicted ``storm surge flooding of four to six
feet above normal tide levels, accompanied by large and dangerous
battering waves'' in coastal areas of the hurricane watch zone.
</P>
<P>
   Since beginning its deadly promenade across the Caribbean last
weekend, Georges has killed at least 28 people and inflicted
widespread destruction, including more than $1 billion in property
damages in Puerto Rico alone. The Insurance Information Institute
said that most of the $1 billion in claims expected so far will
mostly come from commercial properties like hotels and resorts.
Much of the damage to homes, many of which were uninsured, is still
being calculated.
</P>
<P>
   With sustained winds of 115 mph, the storm has moved on a course
from the northern Leeward Islands west and north across the
Dominican Republic and Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Weather forecasters predicted that Georges, which slowed
somewhat Wednesday and lost enough wind strength that it was
temporarily dropped from a category two to a weaker category one
storm, would strike somewhere in southern Florida late Thursday.
The precise path of the storm remains uncertain, which led the
National Hurricane Center here to declare a hurricane watch for
both the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were waiting for a better sense of where the storm
would hit before ordering evacuations or directing residents to
shelters, said John Joyce, a spokesman for Florida's state
Emergency Operations Center. ``Because of the large swath of this
storm, if you move people, you might have to move them again in
another direction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But from Key West to Key Largo a steady stream of cars and sport
vehicles towing boats moved north on U.S. 1, the only road linking
the low-lying archipelago to mainland Florida, throughout the day.
At 5 p.m., the highway was closed to all southbound traffic, and
the authorities said that residents who remained behind were on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our first mandatory evacuation in memory,'' said Cindy
Peryam, a spokeswoman for the Monroe County sheriff's office, ``so
we have no way of knowing how people will react. But since
Hurricane Andrew, people are much more cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   Evacuees from the Keys have been directed to the main campus of
Florida International University, a stone's throw from the National
Hurricane Center's headquarters west of Miami. But, Ms. Peryam
said, ``We're not going to be able to fit everybody there, so this
is one of those no-win situations where you hope people will go
north.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When Hurricane Andrew struck Miami with winds of 150 mph in
August 1992, almost 90 percent of Miami-Dade County's 2 million
residents had never experienced a tropical storm. But memories of
that experience have remained vivid, and people have moved promptly
to obtain essential emergency supplies.

   ``There were lines before we even opened the store today,'' said
Victor Chin, manager of a Home Depot store in the Miami suburb of
Kendall, which was one of the areas most severely affected by
Hurricane Andrew. He said lines ``are maybe three or four hours
deep,'' with customers stocking up on batteries, plywood,
flashlights and shutters.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Andrew was the most costly natural disaster in
American history, inflicting more than $25 billion in damages,
which led several large insurance companies to abandon the state
and forced others into bankruptcy. The Florida state insurance
commissioner, Bill Nelson, said here Wednesday that an $11 billion
hurricane damage compensation fund has been created, but added that
he expected to have to draw only on a small part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with 1992, he said, ``We are looking at much stronger
structures to endure hurricane force winds.'' Building codes
throughout the state have been tightened, he said, and enforcement
has been stepped up.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Florida residents have been sobered by the trail of
death and devastation Georges has left in its rampage across the
Caribbean. Most of the 28 confirmed deaths blamed on the storm were
in the Dominican Republic and Haiti on the island of Hispaniola,
where damage was widespread in shantytowns where people live in
flimsy houses of dried mud, wood and corrugated roofing.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, 150,000 people were evacuated from coastal and mountain
areas of four eastern provinces. President Fidel Castro urged calm
and ``revolutionary unity'' during a television address, saying
``the resources are ready and the measures available to confront
the hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, local officials also appeared confident that they could
meet whatever Georges threw at them. Government agencies and
disaster relief groups have had time to prepare for the storm and
to study and analyze the mistakes they made in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will not be as bad as Hurricane Andrew,'' Alex Penelas,
mayor of Miami-Dade County, said in a telephone interview
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned, we are not panicking, we are telling people
to be prepared,'' he added. ``My level of apprehension is somewhat
controlled.''

 By BRENDAN M. CASE and THIERRY OGIER, with SERGIO R. BUSTOS in
Miami and JAMES WILSON in Panama City 
 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Enrique Lai is not overly concerned about the Asia crisis. The
Taiwanese entrepreneur owns a US$2 million auto parts manufacturing
plant in Panama, which mainly exports to the United States, but is
now also trying to export more to Central and South America. He is
building a bigger factory to increase capacity and plans to double
his staff.
 &HT;    ``The economic crash has not really hurt us,'' he says.
 &HT;    Lai is not alone. Many Asian firms, facing declining markets at
home, are showing renewed interest in Latin America. Although the
region has been affected by the Asia crisis, it has fared better
than many observers expected and has been praised internationally
for taking the necessary adjustment measures to offset the fallout
from the crisis. Throughout Latin America, several Asian companies
are expanding operations just as others are shrinking or shutting
down.
 &HT;    Among recent examples of increased interest: A 10-day visit in
May to Argentina, Brazil and Chile by a delegation of top Hong Kong
business leaders. It was the largest and most important Hong Kong
delegation ever to visit South America, according to the Hong Kong
Trade Development Council (TDC), which organized the trip.
 &HT;    ``Argentina, Brazil and Chile represent a huge untapped
potential for two-way trade and investment with Hong Kong,''
Michael Sze, executive director of TDC, said after the trip.
 &HT;    A meeting on Latin America in Tokyo in late June and early July
drew some 750 business people. The meeting, organized by the
Inter-American Development Bank and the Export-Import bank of
Japan, was opened by then-Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and
included speeches by Presidents Alberto Fujimori of Peru and Julio
Maria Sanguinetti of Uruguay as well as cabinet ministers from
Colombia, Jamaica, Mexico and Panama.
 &HT;    Fujimori then flew to Vietnam _ the first Peruvian president to
visit that country, while Mexican Trade Minister Herminio Blanco
traveled to Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and other Pacific Rim countries
to underline the government's interest in Asian investment and
counteract the effects of the crisis.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, China sent its vice premier, Qian Qichen, on a
Caribbean tour in July to expand relations.
 &HT;    Last year, before the full effects of the Asia crisis hit, Latin
America saw an increase in trade with Asia. Trade between Latin
America's top seven economies and Panama (a major trading partner
with Asia) and four of Asia's five top economies reached $50.3
billion, a 7.4 percent increase over 1996, according to estimates
by Latin Trade based on data from the International Monetary Fund
(see chart). Taiwan, traditionally the fifth-largest Asian trading
partner with Latin America, declined to provide detailed data on
1997 trade.
 &HT;    Japan remains the undisputed top Asian trade partner. Its Latin
America trade is larger than the total Latin America trade of
Korea, China and Hong Kong combined. Although it did grow by a
respectable 11 percent, Japan's trade increased more slowly than
that of China and Hong Kong, which boosted their Latin America
trade by 24.7 percent and 15.5 percent respectively.
 &HT;    In Latin America, Brazil remains the top trade partner for Asia,
but only slightly ahead of Panama. That fact is caused not by a
booming Panamanian market for Asian goods or Panamanian exports to
Asia, but rather the trade of goods at the Colon Free Zone on
Panama's Atlantic coast. The zone is the world's second-largest
free zone after Hong Kong and trades billions of dollars each year
in imports from Asia and re-exports throughout Latin America.
 &HT;    It is too early to tell how trade between Asia and Latin America
will be affected this year. Some Latin American countries are
expected to see a decrease in their exports to Asia due to the
declined purchasing power there and an increase in imports from
Asia due to the cheaper price of Asian goods caused by weaker
currencies.
 &HT;    Even in the best of times, Asia ranks far behind the United
States and Europe in terms of both trade and investment. Many Asian
companies still view the region with plenty of skepticism and tend
to shy away from making major investments.
 &HT;    Michael Mortimore, who authored a report on foreign direct
investment for the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin
America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), says Japan has ``essentially
been absent from the region.''
 &HT;    ``Japanese investors have long memories and their banks got
badly burned by the Latin debt crisis [during the 1980s],'' says
Mortimore.
 &HT;    The Japanese are also ``turned off'' by the region's general
disorder and violence, and its lack of political and economic
stability, he adds.
 &HT;    At the same time, many Latin Americans are sceptical about Asian
products. Many consumers _ especially in the Caribbean, Central
America and Andean countries _ equate quality with U.S.-made
products. ``We're trying to change that kind of thinking,'' says
David George, a spokesman for the Korea Trade Center in the
Dominican Republic, which opened last year. ``We've had to struggle
to break the hold of the United States in the Dominican Republic,
but we've been able to do it by selling quality products at very
competitive prices.''
 &HT;    Mexico. In Mexico, South Korea's Samsung Corporation has never
been so active. It is already supplying parts and equipment to a
Mexican company with a big service contract with Petroleos
Mexicanos, and might compete for contracts to build power plants
for the Federal Electricity Commission. Most promisingly, Samsung
will bid for several multimillion dollar contracts to refurbish
several Pemex refineries.
 &HT;    ``The crisis in Korea and Asia has forced us to try to penetrate
the Mexican market, and Latin America in general,'' says Alexander
Braune Magallon, the deputy projects manager at Samsung's Mexico
City office. ``In Asia, there's too much supply and not enough
demand. That makes Latin America a real focus for us because we're
looking for new projects to make up for lost demand in Asia.''
 &HT;    Much Japanese and Korean investment has already been plowed into
the maquiladora assembly-for-export plants along the border, which
produce everything from textiles to VCRs to stereos. Samsung
Electronics, for example, spent $200 million to open a computer
monitor and television plant in Tijuana in 1996, helping to make
the sprawling border city the world capital of television
production. It will spend a similar amount expanding production,
and other Asian companies have followed suit.
 &HT;    A quick tour of Tijuana's maquiladoras reveals the plants of not
only the big brand name companies like Samsung, Panasonic and Sony,
but also of their lesser-known suppliers which have moved
production from Asia to Mexico.
 &HT;    Another important slice of investment has been in the automobile
industry. Nissan established a huge production plant in
Aguascalientes in the late 1980s, and has since invited many
Japanese suppliers to establish local operations. Today, more than
half the components in the Nissan Sentras produced there _ many of
which are exported to the United States _ are made in Mexico,
according to Angel Gomez, Aguascalientes' state economic
development director.
 &HT;    But the brightest opportunities for Asian investment are
probably in the large service contracts already being tendered or
likely to go to bid from Pemex and the CFE. Asian companies proved
their mettle in Pemex tenders last year, when a group led by
Korea's Sunkyong Engineering won the huge contract to refurbish the
Cadereyta refinery, beating out a rival group led by Japanese
companies.
 &HT;    ``Where there's work, you have to take advantage of it,'' says
Samsung's Braune.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, one major Korean company indefinitely canceled an
auto parts plant it had been planning because of the crisis at
home, according to an official at the Mexico City office of Kuotro,
the Korean foreign investment agency. Many other companies from
Korea ad Japan have adopted a wait-and-see approach, delaying
projects until the situation in Asia stabilizes
 &HT;    The Development Bank of Korea temporarily closed its offices in
Mexico because of the crisis at home. It had opened in Mexico to
finance big Korean companies' import-export operations. Sources
said it might reopen within three to five years.
 &HT;    Korea Telecom is also pulling out. The communications giant
owned 49 percent of Miditel, a small telecom company headed by
Mexican businessman Antonio Kanahuati. But KT decided it couldn't
meet its projected Mexican investment commitments of more than $1
billion dollars over the next few years because of problems at
home. It sold its share to Miditel's Mexican owners for $49.5
million.
 &HT;    Once the crisis is over, long-term factors such as the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) should boost Asian
investment. To qualify as a North American product, goods of all
kinds will need a progressively higher percentage of North American
components. Asian companies still use a higher portion of
components from outside North America than U.S. and European
companies, so new investment is expected as Asian plants using
Mexico as an export platform for the United States strive to retain
preferential tariff treatment under NAFTA.
 &HT;    One example is Aventec, a joint venture led by Sumitomo that
announced a $50 million investment this year to supply a General
Motors plant in Silao, an industrial city in the central state of
Guanajuato. Sumitomo invited Japanese partner Hirotec and
Detroit-based Budd Co. to join the alliance and establish their
first operations in Mexico. The plant should be completed by the
middle of 1999.
 &HT;    ``This kind of project is planned for a long time, and the
crisis was not enough to derail it,'' says Gustavo Funakubo, a
manager at Sumitomo in Mexico City.
 &HT;    Brazil. Although Japanese construction equipment manufacturer
Komatsu recently announced plans to invest $25 million in Brazil
this year to create a subsidiary in the South American country, the
company is an exception. Asian investments are down in Brazil, but
not necessarily due to lack of funds from Asia alone, but also the
fact that Brazil has been one of the Latin American economies worst
hit by the Asia crisis.
 &HT;    When the Brazilian government offered attractive fiscal
incentives for car manufacturers willing to set up an industrial
base in less developed regions of the country last year, many Asian
companies rushed to announce ambitious investment plans. More than
half of the 25 industrial projects designed to industrialize the
north, north-east and the center-west of Brazil came from Japanese,
South Korean, and Chinese firms.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, none of them has materialized since. Asia Motors
was even fined for starting to import vehicles at lower duties
before ploughing any money to build its first Brazilian plant in
the state of Bahia.
 &HT;    Despite the present difficulties at home and delays in
investment in Brazil, the company's local executives still maintain
that the $500 million plant will start operating next year.
 &HT;    Asia Motors' misadventures illustrate the reverting trend with
which Asian companies have to deal. ``The fire power of these
countries is on the wane and their investment share is going to
fall even further,'' says Octavio de Barros, director of Sobeet, a
think-tank which has been monitoring foreign direct investment in
Brazil. ``Japan's investment capacity, as well as other emerging
economies such as South Korea's, is being reduced. The trend is to
a decline in investment.''
 &HT;    Apart from Asia Motors, Hyundai plans have also run into
trouble. The $200 million project to build a auto plant in Bahia
was postponed indefinitely. Japanese manufacturers are at a
slightly more advanced stage: Toyota and Honda also decided to
produce vehicles locally and are investing $150 million each.
 &HT;    Honda started producing vehicles from Sumare in the state of Sao
Paulo, but has delayed plans to build a $300 million
motorcycle-assembly unit in Goias, in the central-western region.
 &HT;    Toyota's car production was scheduled to start in August from
its plant in Metropolitan Sao Paulo at a modest yearly rate of
15,000 units. The Japanese company still has to decide whether it
will build another plant light-commercial vehicles plant in Brazil
or in Argentina next year.
 &HT;    Asian companies have registered a modest presence in the
telecommunication privatization process. Still, Korea Mobile
Telecom lifted the B-band cellular concession in the states of Rio
de Janeiro and Espirito Santo in association with Brazilian
partners. The winning consortium offered $1.3 billion to win the
bid. The Japanese operator DDI and Nissho Iwai were also part of
the winning consortium in the state of Parana, in southern Brazil
($300 million).
 &HT;    In electronics, the end of the domestic consumer boom that
occurred even before austerity measures were adopted in Brazil last
November has also meant trouble for Samsung, which has suspended
investments in prouduction of electronic appliances in Manaus as
well as in cellular phones in Sao Paulo. Still the South Korean
multinational started producing computer monitors in June. Some $3
million have also been invested to produce 15- and 17-inch monitors
by the end of the year.
 &HT;    Trade aides in diplomatic missions argue that the Asian crisis
should lead to an increase in Japanese investment in Brazil. The
trend would reflect a change in the interest of Japanese business
towards Asia after the financial crisis affecting the region.
Companies would find an outlet for their products and their
investment capacity in markets which have not been weakened by the
crisis.
 &HT;    ``Many Japanese businessmen realize that they were wrong in
gambling everything [on] the growth of the Asian tigers. They have
to search for other markets and here Brazil has emerged as a
privileged partner,'' Joseph Tuntundjian, vice president of
Brazilian trading company Cotia Trading, said during a
brainstorming workshop organized by the American Chamber of
Commerce in Sao Paulo in May.
 &HT;    Panama. Panama hopes to profit from the Asian crisis by giving
investors from the Far East what they no longer feel they can get
closer to home-stability. Its dollar economy, raising labor costs
above the levels of its neighbors, has often been seen as a
deterrent to investment. But with Asian investors having been
shaken by the currency turmoil in countries like Indonesia and
Malaysia, some promoters say Panama's dollar can offer the best
possible protection against a further case of burnt fingers.
 &HT;    ``Taiwanese investors need security and they focused on China
and other Asian countries,'' says Marcos Chan, press attache at the
Taiwanese embassy in Panama City. ``But now they could be more keen
to come to Panama after having seen what happened to currencies in
other countries in South East Asia.''
 &HT;    Asia has long had a big commercial presence in Panama through
the Colon Free Zone. Hong Kong, Japan and Korea are some of the
biggest users, sending goods for re-export throughout Latin
America.
 &HT;    The Asian presence is now increasing in other areas. The
flagship Asian investments so far have been in the port sector,
where Evergreen, the Taiwanese port and shipping company, and
Hutchison Port Holdings, part of Hong Kong's Hutchison Whampoa,
have begun operations. Evergreen has already invested $100 million
in a port that it says can handle 400,000 TEUs a year. Hutchison's
local subsidiary won a concession to run two privatized ports and
is set to invest a similar sum.
 &HT;    But ports aren't the full story of Asia's investment. Businesses
are sniffing around the other opportunities offered by what has
been called the world's biggest real estate deal _ the handover to
the Panamanian government of the `reverted areas,' massive tracts
of canal zone land that were once under U.S. control. Deals are
being struck with ARI, the Interoceanic Regional Authority charged
with attracting investment to the former canal land.
 &HT;    At Davis, a former U.S. military installation for vehicle
maintenance, a 35-hectare export processing zone has been set up in
a joint venture between Panama and Taiwan. Eight Taiwanese
companies are installed in light manufacturing operations, making
goods such as umbrellas, lighters and plastic bags. Their total
investment has been some $10 million.
 &HT;    A similar export processing zone for Korean companies is
planned, but the investment has not been confirmed _ a delay put
down to the upheaval of the Korean economic crisis followed by the
change of government in Seoul. Yet, Panama is confident that a
contract will be signed soon for the 25-hectare zone, says ARI
adviser Alberto Navarro. Plans include a hotel and convention
center.
 &HT;    Korean investors are also involved with U.S. partners in an
ambitious $300 million tourism development. Villas, time-share
apartments and a 500-room hotel are planned for a chain of three
islands at the southern end of the Panama Canal, linked by a
monorail.
 &HT;    Outlook. With the increased interest among Asian companies and
expectations of a turnaround in Asia within the next couple of
years, Latin American trade with Asia should grow. However, while
many Latin American private- and public-sector leaders express
hopes of increased Asian direct investment, the signs indicate a
mixed outlook. While some Asian nations _ most notably China and
Hong Kong _ may boost their ties with Latin America, other nations
such as Japan and Korea may not.
 &HT;    Japanese foreign direct investment isn't likely to increase to
Latin America over the next few years, according to a survey
carried out late last year by the Export-Import Bank of Japan. The
bank reported that it surveyed 445 manufacturing companies _ each
with three or more overseas affiliates _ and found that Brazil was
the only Latin American country of interest. ``The country's
economic stability has been taking root, and an interest in
[Brazil] as a destination for investment is growing,'' the survey
noted.
 &HT;    Meanwhile entrepreneurs like Lai are going ahead with their
investments, as are companies from other Asian countries. ``South
America and East Asia will likely be the two largest growth centers
in the world economy in the next 50 years,'' says Hong Kong's Sze.
``It makes sense for us to get to know more about each other.''

 &HT;    Enrique Lai is not overly concerned about the Asia crisis. The
Taiwanese entrepreneur owns a US$2 million auto parts manufacturing
plant in Panama, which mainly exports to the United States, but is
now also trying to export more to Central and South America. He is
building a bigger factory to increase capacity and plans to double
his staff.
 &HT;    ``The economic crash has not really hurt us,'' he says.
 &HT;    Lai is not alone. Many Asian firms, facing declining markets at
home, are showing renewed interest in Latin America. Although the
region has been affected by the Asia crisis, it has fared better
than many observers expected and has been praised internationally
for taking the necessary adjustment measures to offset the fallout
from the crisis. Throughout Latin America, several Asian companies
are expanding operations just as others are shrinking or shutting
down.
 &HT;    Among recent examples of increased interest: A 10-day visit in
May to Argentina, Brazil and Chile by a delegation of top Hong Kong
business leaders. It was the largest and most important Hong Kong
delegation ever to visit South America, according to the Hong Kong
Trade Development Council (TDC), which organized the trip.
 &HT;    ``Argentina, Brazil and Chile represent a huge untapped
potential for two-way trade and investment with Hong Kong,''
Michael Sze, executive director of TDC, said after the trip.
 &HT;    A meeting on Latin America in Tokyo in late June and early July
drew some 750 business people. The meeting, organized by the
Inter-American Development Bank and the Export-Import bank of
Japan, was opened by then-Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and
included speeches by Presidents Alberto Fujimori of Peru and Julio
Maria Sanguinetti of Uruguay as well as cabinet ministers from
Colombia, Jamaica, Mexico and Panama.
 &HT;    Fujimori then flew to Vietnam _ the first Peruvian president to
visit that country, while Mexican Trade Minister Herminio Blanco
traveled to Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and other Pacific Rim countries
to underline the government's interest in Asian investment and
counteract the effects of the crisis.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, China sent its vice premier, Qian Qichen, on a
Caribbean tour in July to expand relations.
 &HT;    Last year, before the full effects of the Asia crisis hit, Latin
America saw an increase in trade with Asia. Trade between Latin
America's top seven economies and Panama (a major trading partner
with Asia) and four of Asia's five top economies reached $50.3
billion, a 7.4 percent increase over 1996, according to estimates
by Latin Trade based on data from the International Monetary Fund
(see chart). Taiwan, traditionally the fifth-largest Asian trading
partner with Latin America, declined to provide detailed data on
1997 trade.
 &HT;    Japan remains the undisputed top Asian trade partner. Its Latin
America trade is larger than the total Latin America trade of
Korea, China and Hong Kong combined. Although it did grow by a
respectable 11 percent, Japan's trade increased more slowly than
that of China and Hong Kong, which boosted their Latin America
trade by 24.7 percent and 15.5 percent respectively.
 &HT;    In Latin America, Brazil remains the top trade partner for Asia,
but only slightly ahead of Panama. That fact is caused not by a
booming Panamanian market for Asian goods or Panamanian exports to
Asia, but rather the trade of goods at the Colon Free Zone on
Panama's Atlantic coast. The zone is the world's second-largest
free zone after Hong Kong and trades billions of dollars each year
in imports from Asia and re-exports throughout Latin America.
 &HT;    It is too early to tell how trade between Asia and Latin America
will be affected this year. Some Latin American countries are
expected to see a decrease in their exports to Asia due to the
declined purchasing power there and an increase in imports from
Asia due to the cheaper price of Asian goods caused by weaker
currencies.
 &HT;    Even in the best of times, Asia ranks far behind the United
States and Europe in terms of both trade and investment. Many Asian
companies still view the region with plenty of skepticism and tend
to shy away from making major investments.
 &HT;    Michael Mortimore, who authored a report on foreign direct
investment for the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin
America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), says Japan has ``essentially
been absent from the region.''
 &HT;    ``Japanese investors have long memories and their banks got
badly burned by the Latin debt crisis [during the 1980s],'' says
Mortimore.
 &HT;    The Japanese are also ``turned off'' by the region's general
disorder and violence, and its lack of political and economic
stability, he adds.
 &HT;    At the same time, many Latin Americans are sceptical about Asian
products. Many consumers _ especially in the Caribbean, Central
America and Andean countries _ equate quality with U.S.-made
products. ``We're trying to change that kind of thinking,'' says
David George, a spokesman for the Korea Trade Center in the
Dominican Republic, which opened last year. ``We've had to struggle
to break the hold of the United States in the Dominican Republic,
but we've been able to do it by selling quality products at very
competitive prices.''
 &HT;    Mexico. In Mexico, South Korea's Samsung Corporation has never
been so active. It is already supplying parts and equipment to a
Mexican company with a big service contract with Petroleos
Mexicanos, and might compete for contracts to build power plants
for the Federal Electricity Commission. Most promisingly, Samsung
will bid for several multimillion dollar contracts to refurbish
several Pemex refineries.
 &HT;    ``The crisis in Korea and Asia has forced us to try to penetrate
the Mexican market, and Latin America in general,'' says Alexander
Braune Magallon, the deputy projects manager at Samsung's Mexico
City office. ``In Asia, there's too much supply and not enough
demand. That makes Latin America a real focus for us because we're
looking for new projects to make up for lost demand in Asia.''
 &HT;    Much Japanese and Korean investment has already been plowed into
the maquiladora assembly-for-export plants along the border, which
produce everything from textiles to VCRs to stereos. Samsung
Electronics, for example, spent $200 million to open a computer
monitor and television plant in Tijuana in 1996, helping to make
the sprawling border city the world capital of television
production. It will spend a similar amount expanding production,
and other Asian companies have followed suit.
 &HT;    A quick tour of Tijuana's maquiladoras reveals the plants of not
only the big brand name companies like Samsung, Panasonic and Sony,
but also of their lesser-known suppliers which have moved
production from Asia to Mexico.
 &HT;    Another important slice of investment has been in the automobile
industry. Nissan established a huge production plant in
Aguascalientes in the late 1980s, and has since invited many
Japanese suppliers to establish local operations. Today, more than
half the components in the Nissan Sentras produced there _ many of
which are exported to the United States _ are made in Mexico,
according to Angel Gomez, Aguascalientes' state economic
development director.
 &HT;    But the brightest opportunities for Asian investment are
probably in the large service contracts already being tendered or
likely to go to bid from Pemex and the CFE. Asian companies proved
their mettle in Pemex tenders last year, when a group led by
Korea's Sunkyong Engineering won the huge contract to refurbish the
Cadereyta refinery, beating out a rival group led by Japanese
companies.
 &HT;    ``Where there's work, you have to take advantage of it,'' says
Samsung's Braune.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, one major Korean company indefinitely canceled an
auto parts plant it had been planning because of the crisis at
home, according to an official at the Mexico City office of Kuotro,
the Korean foreign investment agency. Many other companies from
Korea ad Japan have adopted a wait-and-see approach, delaying
projects until the situation in Asia stabilizes
 &HT;    The Development Bank of Korea temporarily closed its offices in
Mexico because of the crisis at home. It had opened in Mexico to
finance big Korean companies' import-export operations. Sources
said it might reopen within three to five years.
 &HT;    Korea Telecom is also pulling out. The communications giant
owned 49 percent of Miditel, a small telecom company headed by
Mexican businessman Antonio Kanahuati. But KT decided it couldn't
meet its projected Mexican investment commitments of more than $1
billion dollars over the next few years because of problems at
home. It sold its share to Miditel's Mexican owners for $49.5
million.
 &HT;    Once the crisis is over, long-term factors such as the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) should boost Asian
investment. To qualify as a North American product, goods of all
kinds will need a progressively higher percentage of North American
components. Asian companies still use a higher portion of
components from outside North America than U.S. and European
companies, so new investment is expected as Asian plants using
Mexico as an export platform for the United States strive to retain
preferential tariff treatment under NAFTA.
 &HT;    One example is Aventec, a joint venture led by Sumitomo that
announced a $50 million investment this year to supply a General
Motors plant in Silao, an industrial city in the central state of
Guanajuato. Sumitomo invited Japanese partner Hirotec and
Detroit-based Budd Co. to join the alliance and establish their
first operations in Mexico. The plant should be completed by the
middle of 1999.
 &HT;    ``This kind of project is planned for a long time, and the
crisis was not enough to derail it,'' says Gustavo Funakubo, a
manager at Sumitomo in Mexico City.
 &HT;    Brazil. Although Japanese construction equipment manufacturer
Komatsu recently announced plans to invest $25 million in Brazil
this year to create a subsidiary in the South American country, the
company is an exception. Asian investments are down in Brazil, but
not necessarily due to lack of funds from Asia alone, but also the
fact that Brazil has been one of the Latin American economies worst
hit by the Asia crisis.
 &HT;    When the Brazilian government offered attractive fiscal
incentives for car manufacturers willing to set up an industrial
base in less developed regions of the country last year, many Asian
companies rushed to announce ambitious investment plans. More than
half of the 25 industrial projects designed to industrialize the
north, north-east and the center-west of Brazil came from Japanese,
South Korean, and Chinese firms.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, none of them has materialized since. Asia Motors
was even fined for starting to import vehicles at lower duties
before ploughing any money to build its first Brazilian plant in
the state of Bahia.
 &HT;    Despite the present difficulties at home and delays in
investment in Brazil, the company's local executives still maintain
that the $500 million plant will start operating next year.
 &HT;    Asia Motors' misadventures illustrate the reverting trend with
which Asian companies have to deal. ``The fire power of these
countries is on the wane and their investment share is going to
fall even further,'' says Octavio de Barros, director of Sobeet, a
think-tank which has been monitoring foreign direct investment in
Brazil. ``Japan's investment capacity, as well as other emerging
economies such as South Korea's, is being reduced. The trend is to
a decline in investment.''
 &HT;    Apart from Asia Motors, Hyundai plans have also run into
trouble. The $200 million project to build a auto plant in Bahia
was postponed indefinitely. Japanese manufacturers are at a
slightly more advanced stage: Toyota and Honda also decided to
produce vehicles locally and are investing $150 million each.
 &HT;    Honda started producing vehicles from Sumare in the state of Sao
Paulo, but has delayed plans to build a $300 million
motorcycle-assembly unit in Goias, in the central-western region.
 &HT;    Toyota's car production was scheduled to start in August from
its plant in Metropolitan Sao Paulo at a modest yearly rate of
15,000 units. The Japanese company still has to decide whether it
will build another plant light-commercial vehicles plant in Brazil
or in Argentina next year.
 &HT;    Asian companies have registered a modest presence in the
telecommunication privatization process. Still, Korea Mobile
Telecom lifted the B-band cellular concession in the states of Rio
de Janeiro and Espirito Santo in association with Brazilian
partners. The winning consortium offered $1.3 billion to win the
bid. The Japanese operator DDI and Nissho Iwai were also part of
the winning consortium in the state of Parana, in southern Brazil
($300 million).
 &HT;    In electronics, the end of the domestic consumer boom that
occurred even before austerity measures were adopted in Brazil last
November has also meant trouble for Samsung, which has suspended
investments in prouduction of electronic appliances in Manaus as
well as in cellular phones in Sao Paulo. Still the South Korean
multinational started producing computer monitors in June. Some $3
million have also been invested to produce 15- and 17-inch monitors
by the end of the year.
 &HT;    Trade aides in diplomatic missions argue that the Asian crisis
should lead to an increase in Japanese investment in Brazil. The
trend would reflect a change in the interest of Japanese business
towards Asia after the financial crisis affecting the region.
Companies would find an outlet for their products and their
investment capacity in markets which have not been weakened by the
crisis.
 &HT;    ``Many Japanese businessmen realize that they were wrong in
gambling everything [on] the growth of the Asian tigers. They have
to search for other markets and here Brazil has emerged as a
privileged partner,'' Joseph Tuntundjian, vice president of
Brazilian trading company Cotia Trading, said during a
brainstorming workshop organized by the American Chamber of
Commerce in Sao Paulo in May.
 &HT;    Panama. Panama hopes to profit from the Asian crisis by giving
investors from the Far East what they no longer feel they can get
closer to home-stability. Its dollar economy, raising labor costs
above the levels of its neighbors, has often been seen as a
deterrent to investment. But with Asian investors having been
shaken by the currency turmoil in countries like Indonesia and
Malaysia, some promoters say Panama's dollar can offer the best
possible protection against a further case of burnt fingers.
 &HT;    ``Taiwanese investors need security and they focused on China
and other Asian countries,'' says Marcos Chan, press attache at the
Taiwanese embassy in Panama City. ``But now they could be more keen
to come to Panama after having seen what happened to currencies in
other countries in South East Asia.''
 &HT;    Asia has long had a big commercial presence in Panama through
the Colon Free Zone. Hong Kong, Japan and Korea are some of the
biggest users, sending goods for re-export throughout Latin
America.
 &HT;    The Asian presence is now increasing in other areas. The
flagship Asian investments so far have been in the port sector,
where Evergreen, the Taiwanese port and shipping company, and
Hutchison Port Holdings, part of Hong Kong's Hutchison Whampoa,
have begun operations. Evergreen has already invested $100 million
in a port that it says can handle 400,000 TEUs a year. Hutchison's
local subsidiary won a concession to run two privatized ports and
is set to invest a similar sum.
 &HT;    But ports aren't the full story of Asia's investment. Businesses
are sniffing around the other opportunities offered by what has
been called the world's biggest real estate deal _ the handover to
the Panamanian government of the `reverted areas,' massive tracts
of canal zone land that were once under U.S. control. Deals are
being struck with ARI, the Interoceanic Regional Authority charged
with attracting investment to the former canal land.
 &HT;    At Davis, a former U.S. military installation for vehicle
maintenance, a 35-hectare export processing zone has been set up in
a joint venture between Panama and Taiwan. Eight Taiwanese
companies are installed in light manufacturing operations, making
goods such as umbrellas, lighters and plastic bags. Their total
investment has been some $10 million.
 &HT;    A similar export processing zone for Korean companies is
planned, but the investment has not been confirmed _ a delay put
down to the upheaval of the Korean economic crisis followed by the
change of government in Seoul. Yet, Panama is confident that a
contract will be signed soon for the 25-hectare zone, says ARI
adviser Alberto Navarro. Plans include a hotel and convention
center.
 &HT;    Korean investors are also involved with U.S. partners in an
ambitious $300 million tourism development. Villas, time-share
apartments and a 500-room hotel are planned for a chain of three
islands at the southern end of the Panama Canal, linked by a
monorail.
 &HT;    Outlook. With the increased interest among Asian companies and
expectations of a turnaround in Asia within the next couple of
years, Latin American trade with Asia should grow. However, while
many Latin American private- and public-sector leaders express
hopes of increased Asian direct investment, the signs indicate a
mixed outlook. While some Asian nations _ most notably China and
Hong Kong _ may boost their ties with Latin America, other nations
such as Japan and Korea may not.
 &HT;    Japanese foreign direct investment isn't likely to increase to
Latin America over the next few years, according to a survey
carried out late last year by the Export-Import Bank of Japan. The
bank reported that it surveyed 445 manufacturing companies _ each
with three or more overseas affiliates _ and found that Brazil was
the only Latin American country of interest. ``The country's
economic stability has been taking root, and an interest in
[Brazil] as a destination for investment is growing,'' the survey
noted.
 &HT;    Meanwhile entrepreneurs like Lai are going ahead with their
investments, as are companies from other Asian countries. ``South
America and East Asia will likely be the two largest growth centers
in the world economy in the next 50 years,'' says Hong Kong's Sze.
``It makes sense for us to get to know more about each other.''

SERBS CONTINUE ATTACKS ON KOSOVO ALBANIANS 
</HEADLINE>

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Scoffing at warnings by the West that
force might be used to end the fighting in Kosovo, the Yugoslav
president, Slobodan Milosevic, pressed ahead with a tank and
artillery offensive on Wednesday that chased about 10,000 ethnic
Albanian civilians into the hills and left many of their homes on
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Flames and columns of thick white smoke were visible, and the
sound of artillery echoed from more than a dozen villages at the
foot of the Cicavica hills, just a few miles north of the
provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
   European Union diplomatic monitors said they saw Yugoslav army
tanks entering the broad swath of countryside, which had been
tightly sealed by the Serbian police. Late Wednesday afternoon army
trucks were heading for the region.
</P>
<P>
   The monitors, as well as workers from the U.N. high commissioner
for refugees, skirted the area in armored vehicles but were turned
back, even on narrow side roads, by heavily manned roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
   A senior official of the U.N. refugee commissioner's office
here, Morgan Morris, said that she believed up to 10,000 civilians
were trapped in the mountains with only the belongings they could
carry, after the artillery fire that started at 5 a.m. on Tuesday
drove them out.
</P>
<P>
   These new ethnic Albanian refugees join more than 200,000 others
who have fled their homes in the last six months. They spent
Tuesday night in the cold and damp with no shelter and little food,
and faced similar conditions Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, the Security Council passed a resolution
Wednesday calling for an end to Serbian attacks on the civilian
population of Kosovo and allowing for the possible use of force to
curb Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   NATO defense ministers, meeting in Portugal on Thursday, are
scheduled to consider several options on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Milosevic's government have repeatedly said in the
last two weeks that the separatist ethnic Albanian guerrillas have
been crushed, statements that Western diplomats say were taken as
meaning that no further military action was needed.
</P>
<P>
   But Milosevic has made a mockery of this interpretation by
continuing to send in his army and police. On Wednesday he sent one
of his senior political colleagues, Milan Milutinovic, to Kosovo to
declare that all was normal.
</P>
<P>
   Milutinovic, the president of Serbia, who drove past the clearly
visible burning villages on his route from Belgrade, said, ``I
didn't see much smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I see that life is normal in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   After months of neglect during the summer, Kosovo has become a
renewed issue for Washington and Western European leaders who
appear uncertain about how to respond to Milosevic's offensive and
the hundreds of thousands of refugees it has created.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo first became a flashpoint in the spring when separatist
guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army started attacking Serbian
policemen and institutions and briefly held some territory.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian police, backed by the Yugoslav army, started an
all-out offensive against Albanian villages that were suspected of
harboring guerrillas. But officials in Washington and at NATO
headquarters acknowledge that the Yugoslav army attacks have gone
beyond rooting out guerrillas and are now intended to intimidate
all ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs make up less than 10 percent of the people in Kosovo,
which has a population of about 2 million, but Serbs control all
functions of government, including the police and the army, in the
overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian province.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian police acknowledged in a statement Wednesday that
the Cicavica hills region had been ``blocked.'' Action was being
taken to search for a ``group of disbanded terrorist units'' that
had attacked Serbian police units, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Western relief agency workers said they believed those who fled
on Tuesday could be stuck outdoors, where the temperatures are
steadily dropping, for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pincer movement, they are trapped by the military
all around,'' said Miss Morris, describing the Yugoslav army's
advance from the west that chased the villagers to the hills and
troop movements from the east that stopped fleeing villagers from
coming down the other side of the hills.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to the European Union monitors, the area under siege
ran from Pristina north to Mitrovica, west to Srbica and then south
to Komorane. The army attacked from all sides, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The monitors, who are supposed to have province-wide access,
have been blocked from witnessing military action by the Serbian
police since the monitoring groups were formed in June. Once the
Yugoslav and Serbian forces withdraw from villages, the monitors
are then allowed to inspect the damage.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday afternoon the village of Stanovce was a kind of
viewing stage of the front line as the Albanian men of the village
looked fearfully to the neighboring village of Bencuk six miles to
the west. Houses burned and thick plumes of white smoke clouded the
view of the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   In the village of Glavatin, about four miles to the southwest of
Stanovce, many of the red-tiled two-story houses were also on fire.
According to a U.N. refugee report Wednesday night, up to 15
villages at the Cicavica hills had been attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the artillery was not aimed at Stanovce, all the
women and children were told by the men to leave. The dirt tracks
of the village were empty except for clusters of anxious men.
</P>
<P>
   One young woman, Selvete Rrahimi, 17, came back Wednesday
afternoon to check whether the family house was still secure. After
seeing that the place was still intact, she hurried back to the
main road to return to the safety of relatives near the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he didn't leave Stanovce for fear of an attack by the
Yugoslav army, Nazmi Segashi, 23, a builder, said: ``Where should I
go? War is everywhere.''

Clinton's presidency, an unprecedented dichotomy of opinion has
emerged, built around a single basic question: What is important to
Americans? By ROBERT E. THOMPSON. (Filed in the ``k'' category.)

   SCHWERIN, Germany _ Karl Roost listened on Tuesday as Chancellor
Helmut Kohl denounced the evils of the old East German government,
and by the end of the speech his blood was boiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called this a criminal state, as if we were all criminals
just because we lived here at a time when we had no other
choices,'' he said as soon as Kohl had finished talking in front of
the baroque palace that is now the state parliament of
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, in eastern Germany. ``He is writing
us all out of the picture, and it makes me furious.''
</P>
<P>
   Roost, a 51-year-old unemployed meatpacker, supports an
increasingly important political group that is an anathema to the
West: the Party of Democratic Socialism, the successor to East
Germany Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Nourished by anger at eastern Germany's rampant unemployment,
the party could capture enough votes in the national elections on
Sunday to play an important swing role. That could cause problems
for the front runner in the race for chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder,
the candidate of the Social Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Polls suggest that the former Communists could win more than 20
percent of the eastern vote and have a good chance of becoming
minority partners in a governing coalition in this state.
</P>
<P>
   That could have an important impact on the political arithmetic
that determines the composition of the next national government,
because Germany's mainstream parties are now in such a tight race
that neither of the two mainstream coalitions are likely to capture
the majority of votes necessary to form a government.
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that the former Communists steal votes from the
left-of-center Social Democrats, they could make it difficult for
Schroeder to form a majority governing coalition even if, as seems
likely, he comes out ahead of Kohl. If the Party of Democratic
Socialism gets at least 5 percent of the national vote, it will be
entitled to a proportionate number of seats in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far the Social Democrats have been hoping to attain a
parliamentary majority with help from the environmentalist Green
Party, while Kohl's Christian Democrats are seeking to preserve
their coalition with the conservative Free Democratic Party and the
Bavarian Christian Social Union.
</P>
<P>
   But with the most recent polls suggesting an extremely tight
race, political experts say it is entirely possible that neither
conventional coalition will get a majority of votes.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder and the Greens have both ruled out a national
coalition with the former Communists; such a move would be
political suicide in western Germany. That in turn increases the
probability of a so-called Grand Coalition, in which the Social
Democrats would share power with the Christian Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But that would play havoc with both sides. Kohl and his Bavarian
partners are both adamantly against a grand coalition. The Green
Party's leader, Joschka Fischer, equally incensed about the idea,
has focused his campaign on persuading people not to vote for the
far-left party.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl, who is unpopular in much of eastern Germany and faced
jeering students during his speech, admitted that his vision of
``blooming landscapes'' had not come about as fast as he had hoped.
But he warned against turning back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in Frankfurt on the Oder River are just as
industrious as those in Frankfurt on the Main River, but they were
betrayed by a criminal government,'' he said. Disputing statements
by Schroeder, Kohl routinely warns that the Social Democrats would
form an alliance with the ex-Communists if they needed it to gain
power.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``red scare'' does not play well here. The Party of
Democratic Socialism has 11,000 official members in this state,
while the Christian Democrats have only 7,500 and the Social
Democrats only 3,500. The party has also built up a strong network
of local organizations, and 75 towns now have mayors from the Party
of Democratic Socialism.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The party platform calls for substantial increases in money for
jobs, schools and social programs and much higher taxes on
businesses and wealthy individuals. It also calls for a retreat
from government policies of returning houses and property that were
confiscated decades ago by the East German government.
</P>
<P>
   But the real appeal of the party is its close association with
eastern Germany.
</P>
<P>
   On the state level, the party could become part of a governing
coalition for the first time since Germany was reunited. Here in
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Social Democrats have held extensive
discussions with the party about a coalition. The Social Democrats
are currently in a ``grand coalition'' here with the Christian
Democrats but the Social Democrats are desperate to break away.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more surprising, Schroeder recently gave his grudging
approval to a so-called ``red/red'' state coalition if the election
results here make it unavoidable. Although Schroeder has made it
clear he would not consider such a coalition on the national level,
he has also said he had to recognize certain realities in the east.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Schwerin, a beautiful city where the parliament looks
like a fairy-tale castle, even people who do not like the former
Communists say they are weary with the choices foisted on them from
the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I don't like is that they spend all their time fighting
each other, and they never seem to be addressing our interests and
our needs when they come here and give their speeches,'' said
Barbara Wendt, who came to listen with her two teen-age children.
``The young people are totally frustrated and worried that they
won't have any future. It's no wonder that they booed Kohl; they
booed Schroeder when he came here, too.''

 Por BRENDAN M. CASE y THIERRY OGIER, con SERGIO R. BUSTOS en Miami
y JAMES WILSON en Panama 
 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Enrique Lai no esta muy preocupado por la crisis en Asia. Este
empresario taiwanes es dueno de una planta de US$2 millones que
fabrica de piezas para automoviles en Panama. Su mercado principal
de exportacion es Estados Unidos, y ahora trata de exportar mas a
Centro y Sudamerica. Lai ha comenzado a levantar una planta de mas
capacidad y planea duplicar la cantidad de empleados.
 &HT;    ``Los problemas economicos [en Asia] no nos han afectado
mucho,'' dice.
 &HT;    Y Lai no esta solo. Muchas firmas asiaticas, enfrentadas a
mercados en declinacion en sus territorios, muestran un renovado
interes en Latinoamerica. Aunque la region se ha sentido los
efectos de la crisis asiatica, ha salido mejor parada de lo que
esperaban muchos y ha recibido aplausos internacionales por tomar
las medidas de ajuste necesarias para compensar los efectos del
desastre. Muchas firmas asiaticas han comenzado a ampliar sus
operaciones en America Latina, justo cuando empresas de otros
paises hacen lo contrario.
 &HT;    Entre los ejemplos recientes de un mayor interes en la region
estan: una visita de 10 dias realizada en mayo a Argentina, Brasil
y Chile por una delegacion de destacados lideres empresariales de
Hong Kong. Esta ha sido la mayor y mas importante delegacion de
Hong Kong que visita Sudamerica, segun el Consejo de Fomento
Comercial de Hong Kong (TDC), que organizo el viaje.
 &HT;    ``Argentina, Brasil y Chile... representan un gran potencial no
aprovechado para el comercio bilateral y las inversiones con Hong
Kong,'' afirmo Michael Sze, director ejecutivo del TDC, despues del
viaje.
 &HT;    Una reunion sobre America Latina celebrada en Tokio a finales de
junio y principios de julio atrajo a mas de 750 empresarios. La
cita, organizada por el Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo y el
Banco de Importacion y Exportacion de Japon, fue inaugurada por el
entonces primer ministro Ryutaro Hashimoto, y entre los oradores
destacados estuvieron los presidentes de Peru, Alberto Fujimori, y
Julio Maria Sanguinetti, de Uruguay, asi como ministros clave de
Mexico, Colombia, Jamaica y Panama.
 &HT;    Desde Tokio, Fujimori viajo a Vietnam (la primera visita de un
presidente peruano a ese pais). Por su parte, Herminio Blanco,
secretario de Comercio de Mexico, inicio un viaje por Corea del
Sur, Taiwan y otros paises de la Cuenca del Pacifico, con el fin de
subrayar el interes del gobierno mexicano en las inversiones
asiaticas y contrarrestar los efectos de la crisis.
 &HT;    Por su parte, China envio en julio a su primer ministro, Qian
Qichen, a varios paises latinoamericanos con el objetivo de ampliar
las relaciones.
 &HT;    El ano pasado, antes de sentirse la fuerza de la crisis
asiatica, el comercio de Asia con Latinoamerica habia aumentado. El
comercio entre las siete mayores economias latinoamericanas mas
Panama (uno de los mayores socios comerciales de Asia), y las
cuatro mayores economias asiaticas, alcanzo US$50.300 millones, un
aumento del 7,4 por ciento sobre 1996, segun calculos de Latin
Trade basados en informacion del Fondo Monetario Internacional (ver
tabla). Taiwan, que tradicionalmente ha sido el quinto socio
comercial asiatico con Latinoamerica, prefirio no entregar
informacion detallada sobre la actividad comercial en 1997.
 &HT;    Japon es todavia el lider comercial indiscutido de Asia con
Latinoamerica. Su comercio con la region es mayor que el total de
America Latina con Corea, China y Hong Kong combinado. Aunque
crecio un respetable 11 por ciento, el comercio de Japon con
America Latina aumento a un ritmo menor que el de China y Hong
Kong, que incrementaron su actividad comercial con Latinoamerica en
un 24,7 por ciento y un 15,5 por ciento, respectivamente.
 &HT;    Entre los paises latinoamericanos, Brasil se mantiene en calidad
del primer socio comercial con Asia, con una ligera ventaja sobre
Panama. Esto se debe no a un auge del mercado panameno para los
bienes asiaticos o a las exportaciones panamenas a Asia, sino al
comercio de bienes en la Zona Libre de Colon, en la costa atlantica
de Panama. La zona libre panamena es la segunda a nivel mundial,
detras de Hong Kong, y comercia bienes por valor de miles de
millones de dolares al ano provenientes de Asia y los reexporta
hacia America Latina.
 &HT;    Es demasiado temprano para decir a que nivel quedara afectado
este ano el comercio entre Asia y America Latina. Se espera que
bajen las exportaciones de algunos paises latinoamericanos con
destino a Asia, debido a la reduccion del poder adquisitivo en esa
region, y que se produzca un aumeno de las importaciones
latinoamericanas de productos asiaticos debido a que valen menos
por la baja de sus divisas.
 &HT;    Incluso en el mejor de los casos, Asia queda muy por detras de
Estados Unidos y Europa en terminos de comercio e inversion en
America Latina. Muchas empresas asiaticas todavia ven la region con
mucho escepticismo y tienden a no realizar inversiones
sustanciales.
 &HT;    Michael Mortimore, autor de un informe de la CEPAL sobre las
inversiones extranjeras directas en America Latina, afirma que
Japon ``en lo esencial se ha mantenido ausente de la region.''
 &HT;    ``Los inversionistas japoneses tienen buena memoria, y sus
bancos perdieron mucho dinero cuando la crisis de la deuda
latinoamericana [en los anos 80],'' explica Mortimore.
 &HT;    A los japoneses tampoco les gusta el desorden general y la
violencia que impera en la region, asi como su falta de estabilidad
economica y politica, agrega.
 &HT;    Al mismo tiempo, muchos latinoamericanos muestran escepticismo
sobre los productos asiaticos. Para muchos consumidores,
especialmente en el Caribe, Centroamerica y los paises andinos, la
calidad es sinonimo de hecho en Estados Unidos. ``Estamos tratando
de cambiar esa manera de pensar,'' dice David George, portavoz del
Centro de Comercio de Corea en la Republica Dominicana, que se
inauguro el ano pasado. ``Hemos tenido que batallar para romper el
control [de los productos estadounidenses] en la Republica
Dominicana, pero hemos podido hacerlo vendiendo productos de
calidad a precios muy competitivos.''
 &HT;    Mexico. La empresa sudcoreana Samsung Corporation nunca ha
estado tan activa en este pais: suministra piezas y equipamiento a
una empresa mexicana que tiene un importante contrato de servicio
con Petroleos Mexicanos, y pudiera competir por contratos para
construir plantas generadoras para la Comision Federal de
Electricidad. Y lo que es mas prometedor, Samsung se presentara a
la licitacion de varios proyectos, por valor de varios millones de
dolares, para reconstruir numerosas refinerias de Pemex.
 &HT;    ``La crisis en Corea y Asia nos ha obligado a tratar de penetrar
el mercado mexicano, en particular, y el latinoamericano en
general,'' explica Alexander Braune Magallon, subgerente de
proyectos en la oficina de Samsung en Mexico DF. ``En Asia hay
demasiada oferta y la demanda no es suficiente. Eso hace que
America Latina se convierta en un mercado de mucho interes para
nosotros porque andamos en busca de nuevos proyectos para
reemplazar la demanda perdida en Asia,'' agrego.
 &HT;    Gran parte de las inversiones japonesas y coreanas han sido en
las maquiladoras a lo largo de la frontera mexicana con Estados
Unidos, que producen desde textiles hasta videograbadoras y
estereos. Samsung Electronics, por ejemplo, invirtio US$200
millones en construir una planta de televisores y monitores de
computadora en Tijuana en 1996, que ayudo a convertir a esta ciudad
en la capital mundial de los televisores. Samsung invertira una
cifra similar para ampliar la produccion, y otras empresas
asiaticas le han seguido los pasos.
 &HT;    Un vistazo rapido a las maquiladoras de Tijuana muestra las
plantas no solo de grandes empresas, como Samsung, Panasonic y
Sony, sino tambien de suministradores menos conocidos que han
mudado la produccion de Asia a Mexico.
 &HT;    Otra parte importante de las inversiones ha sido en el sector
automotriz. Nissan construyo una enorme planta en Aguascalientes a
finales de los anos 80, y desde entonces numerosos suministradores
japoneses han establecido operaciones locales. Hoy, mas de la mitad
de los componentes de los modelos Sentra que la Nissan produce aqui
(muchos se exportan a Estados Unidos) se fabrican en Mexico, segun
Angel Gomez, director de fomento economico de Aguascalientes.
 &HT;    Pero las oportunidades mas brillantes para las inversiones
asiaticas estan probablemente en los sustanciales contratos de
servicio que ya licitan o planean sacar a licitacion empresas como
Pemex y CFE. Las companias asiaticas han probado su fuerza en las
licitaciones de Pemex el ano pasado, cuando un grupo liderado por
Sunkyong Enterprises, de Corea, se llevo un enorme contrato para
reconstruir la refineria de Cadereyta, derrotando a un grupo rival
liderado por empresas japonesas.
 &HT;    ``Donde haya un proyecto, hay que aprovechar la oportunidad,''
dice Braune, de Samsung.
 &HT;    Mientras tanto, una importante empresa coreana cancelo
indefinidamente sus planes de construir una planta de piezas para
automoviles debido a la crisis en Corea, segun un funcionario de la
oficina en Mexico DF de Kuotro, la entidad coreana de inversion en
el extranjero. Muchas otras empresas de Corea y Japon han decidido
esperar y demorar sus proyectos hasta que la situacion en Asia se
estabilice.
 &HT;    El Banco de Fomento de Corea anuncio el cierre temporal de sus
oficinas en Mexico debido a la crisis en casa. La entidad habia
iniciado operaciones en Mexico para financiar las operaciones de
importacion y exportacion de grandes empresas coreanas.
 &HT;    Korea Telecom (KT) tambien ha decidido marcharse de Mexico. El
gigante coreano de las telecomunicaciones tenia una participacion
del 49 por ciento en Miditel, una pequena firma del mismo sector
dirigida por el empresario mexicano Antonio Kanahuati. Pero KT
decidio que no podia cumplir sus proyecciones de inversion en
Mexico (mas de US$1.000 millones durante los proximos anos) debido
a los problemas en casa. KT vendio por US$49,5 millones sus
acciones a los duenos mexicanos de Miditel.
 &HT;    Una vez que la crisis concluya, factores de largo plazo como el
TLC deben dinamizar las inversiones asiaticas en Mexico. Para que
toda clase de productos se consideren oficialmente fabricados en
Norteamerica, requeriran una proporcion cada vez mayor de
componentes fabricados en esa zona. Las empresas asiaticas todavia
usan una proporcion mayor de componentes de fuera de America del
Norte que las empresas de Estados Unidos y Canada, de manera que se
esperan nuevas inversiones a medida que las plantas asiaticas que
usan a Mexico como trampolin de exportaciones hacia Estados Unidos
batallan por retener un trato preferencial en las tarifas a tenor
con el TLC.
 &HT;    Un ejemplo es Aventec, una empresa conjunta liderada por
Sumitomo que este ano anuncio una inversion de US$50 millones para
entregar suministros a una planta de General Motors en Silao,
ciudad industrial en el estado central de Guanajuato. Sumitomo
invito a Hirotec, de Japon, y a Budd Co., de Detroit, a unirse a la
alianza y establecer sus primeras operaciones en Mexico. La planta
debe concluirse para mediados de 1999.
 &HT;    ``Esta clase de proyecto se planifica a largo plazo, y la crisis
no fue suficiente para descarrilarlo,'' apunto Gustavo Funakubo,
gerente de Sumitomo en Mexico DF.
 &HT;    Brasil. Aunque Sumitomo, fabricante japones de equipos pesados,
anuncio recientemente planes para invertir este ano US$25 millones
en Brasil con el fin de crear una filial en este pais sudamericano,
la empresa es una excepcion. Las inversiones asiaticas en Brasil se
han reducido, per no necesariamente debido a la falta de fondos
provenientes de Asia, sino tambien a que Brasil es una de las
economias latinoamericanas mas golpeadas por la crisis asiatica.
 &HT;    Cuando el gobierno brasileno ofrecio el ano pasado incentivos
fiscales atractivos a los fabricantes de autos que desearan
establecerse en las areas menos desarrolladas del pais, muchas
empresas asiaticas se lanzaron a anunciar ambiciosos planes de
inversion. Mas de la mitad de los 25 proyectos industriales que
tenian por fin industrializar las regiones norte, nordeste y
centrooriental de Brasil, provinieron de empresas de Japon, Corea
del Sur y China.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, ninguna de esas inversiones se ha materializado.
Asia Motors incluso fue multada por comenzar a importar autos a
tarifas menores antes de desembolsar el dinero para construir la
primera planta brasilena en el estado de Bahia.
 &HT;    A pesar de las dificultades en casa y de las demoras de las
inversiones en Brasil, los ejecutivos locales de Asia Motors
sostienen que la planta, valorada en US$500 millones, comenzara a
operar el proximo ano.
 &HT;    Los infortunios de Asia Motors ilustran la tendencia contra la
que tienen que batallar las empresas asiaticas. ``El poderio de
estos paises esta en baja y sus inversiones bajaran aun mas,''
expreso Octavio de Barrios, director de Sobeet, un grupo de estudio
que se ha dedicado a analizar las inversiones directas en Brasil.
``La capacidad de inversion de Japon, y de economias emergentes
como Corea del Sur, se reduce. La tendencia es hacia una reduccion
en la inversion.''
 &HT;    Ademas de Asia Motors, los planes de la automotriz coreana
Hyundai tambien estan en peligro. El proyecto de invertir US$200
millones en construir una planta en Bahia se pospuso
indefinidamente. Las automotrices japonesas estan en una etapa un
poco mas avanzada: Toyota y Honda tambien decidieron producir
vehiculos a nivel local, para lo cual invierten US$50 millones cada
una.
 &HT;    Honda comenzo a producir vehiculos en Sumare, estado de Sao
Paulo, pero ha demorado planes de construir una fabrica de
motocicletas en Goais, en la region centrooccidental.
 &HT;    Toyota tenia planeado que su planta en el Sao Paulo
metropolitano arrancara en agosto con una produccion anual de
15.000 unidades. La empresa japonesa aun no ha decidido si
construira otra planta para vehiculos comerciales ligeros en Brasil
o Argentina el proximo ano.
 &HT;    Las companias asiaticas han registrado una presencia modesta en
el proceso de privatizacion de empresas de telecomunicaciones. Sin
embargo, Korea Mobil Telecom gano la licitacion de la concesion
celular de Banda B en los estados de Rio de Janeiro y Espirito
Santo, en alianza con socios brasilenos. El consorcio gano la
licitacion con una oferta de US$1.300 millones. Las empresas
japonesas DDI y Nissho Iwai tambien fueron parte del consorcio
ganador en el estado de Parana, en el sur del pais, con una oferta
de US$300 millones.
 &HT;    En el sector de la electronica, el final del auge en el consumo
que se produjo antes que las medidas de austeridad fueran
implantadas en Brasil en noviembre pasado, tambien significo
problemas para Samsung, que ha suspendido inversiones en materia de
electrodomesticos en Manaus, asi como otra inversion de US$100
millones en telefonia celular en Sao Paulo. Sin embargo, la
multinacional coreana comenzo en junio a producir monitores para
computadoras con una inversion de unos US$3 millones.
 &HT;    Los encargados de asuntos de comercio en las sedes diplomaticas
alegan que la crisis asiatica debe conducir a un aumento de la
inversion japonesa en Brasil. Esa tendencia reflejaria un cambio en
el interes de los negocios japoneses sobre Asia tras la crisis
financiera que afecta la region. Las empresas japonesas pudieran
encontrar salida para sus productos y capacidad de inversion en
mercados que no han sido afectados por la crisis.
 &HT;    ``Muchos empresarios japoneses se dan cuenta de que se
equivocaron al apostarlo todo al crecimiento de los tigres
asiaticos. Tienen que buscar otros mercados y Brasil ha surgido
como un socio privilegiado,'' expreso Joseph Tuntundjian,
vicepresidente de la empresa brasilena Cotia Trading, durante un
taller organizado en marzo por la Camara de Comercio Americana en
Sao Paulo.
 &HT;    Panama. Este pais espera sacar provecho a la crisis asiatica al
ofrecer a los inversionistas del Lejano Oriente lo que ya no
parecen tener cerca de casa: estabilidad. La economia panamena,
basada en el dolar estadounidense y con altos costos de mano de
obra, con frecuencia se ha visto como un obstaculo a la inversion.
Pero en momentos que los inversionistas asiaticos se han visto
estremecidos por el caos monetario en paises como Indonesia y
Malasia, algunos promotores dicen que el dolar en Panama puede
ofrecer la mejor proteccion posible contra mas problemas.
 &HT;    ``Los inversionistas taiwaneses necesitan seguridad y se
concentran en China y otros paises asiaticos,'' afirma Marcos Chan,
agregado de prensa de la embajada taiwanesa en Panama. ``Pero ahora
pueden estar mas dispuestos a venir a Panama despues de ver lo que
ocurrio con las divisas en otros paises del Sudeste de Asia.''
 &HT;    Las empresas asiaticas siempre han tenido una fuerte presencia
en la Zona Libre de Colon. Hong Kong, Japon y Corea son tres de los
principales clientes de la zona, a donde envian mercancia para
reexportarla al resto de America Latina.
 &HT;    Y esa presencia crece ahora en otras areas. Las principales
inversiones asiaticas en Panama han sido en el sector portuario,
donde Evergreen, la enorme empresa taiwanesa de puerto y cabotaje,
y Hutchison Port Holdings, que forma parte de Hutchison Whampoa, de
Hong Kong, han comenzado a operar. Evergreen ya ha invertido US$100
millones en un puerto que segun la empresa puede manejar 400.000
contenedores al ano. La filial panamena de Hutchison gano una
concesion para operar dos puertos privatizados y esta lista para
invertir una suma similar.
 &HT;    Pero los puertos no son toda la historia de las inversiones
asiaticas en Panama. Empresas de muchos paises estudian otras
oportunidades que ofrece lo que se ha dado en llamar el mayor
negocio de bienes raices del mundo: la entrega al gobierno panameno
de ``areas revertidas,'' grandes terrenos pertenecientes a la Zona
del Canal que antes estaban bajo control de Estados Unidos. Ya han
comenzado a realizarse negocios con la Autoridad Regional
Interoceanica (ARI), entidad encargada de atraer inversiones a la
zona.
 &HT;    En Davis, una antigua instalacion de mantenimiento de vehiculos
de Estados Unidos, se ha establecido una zona de procesamiento de
exportaciones de 35 hectareas a manera de empresa conjunta entre
Panama y Taiwan. Ocho empresas taiwanesas han instalado operaciones
de manufacturas ligeras, como paraguas, encendedores y bolsas
plasticas, con una inversion total de unos US$10 millones.
 &HT;    Tambien se ha planeado una zona de exportacion similar para
empresas coreanas, pero la inversion no se ha confirmado debido a
la crisis economica en Corea que siguio al cambio de gobierno en
Seul. Sin embargo, Panama confia en qu pronto se firmara el
contrato para la zona de 25 hectareas, afirma Alberto Navarro,
asesor de ARI. Los planes incluyen un hotel y un centro de
convenciones.
 &HT;    Varios inversionistas coreanos se han aliado con socios de EU en
un ambicioso proyecto turistico valorado en US$300 millones, que
incluye villas, apartamentos de propiedad compartida y un hotel de
500 habitaciones en una cadena de tres islas en el extremo suroeste
del Canal de Panama, al que se llegara en un monorrail.
 &HT;    Perspectivas. Con el aumento del interes de las empresas
asiaticas y las expectativas de una recuperacion en esa region
durante los proximos dos anos, el comercio de America Latina con
Asia debe crecer. No obstante, aunque numerosos lideres
latinoamericanos, tanto del sector publico como privado, expresan
esperanzas de una mayor inversion asiatica, las senales muestran
una realidad menos definida: aunque algunas naciones, como China y
Hong Kong, pueden mejorar sus lazos con la region, es posible que
otras, como Japon y Corea, no lo hagan.
 &HT;    No es muy probable que la inversion directa de empresas
japonesas aumente en Latinoamerica durante los proximos anos, segun
una encuesta realizada el ano pasado por el Banco de Importacion e
Exportacion de Japon. Entre las 445 empresas manufactureras
encuestadas, todas con tres o mas filiales en el extranjero, Brasil
era el unico pais de interes para los inversionistas japoneses en
America Latina. ``La estabilidad del pais ha echado raices y crece
el interes [en Brasil] como destino de las inversiones,'' indico la
encuesta.
 &HT;    Mientras tanto, los empresarios como Lai siguen adelante con sus
planes, al igual que las empresas de otros paises asiaticos.
``Sudamerica y el Este de Asia probablemente sean las zonas de
mayor crecimiento economico en la economia mundial en los proximos
50 anos,'' afirma Sze, del Consejo de Fomento Comercial de Hong
Kong. ``Para nosotros tiene sentido conocernos mutuamente.''

 &HT;    Enrique Lai no esta muy preocupado por la crisis en Asia. Este
empresario taiwanes es dueno de una planta de US$2 millones que
fabrica de piezas para automoviles en Panama. Su mercado principal
de exportacion es Estados Unidos, y ahora trata de exportar mas a
Centro y Sudamerica. Lai ha comenzado a levantar una planta de mas
capacidad y planea duplicar la cantidad de empleados.
 &HT;    ``Los problemas economicos [en Asia] no nos han afectado
mucho,'' dice.
 &HT;    Y Lai no esta solo. Muchas firmas asiaticas, enfrentadas a
mercados en declinacion en sus territorios, muestran un renovado
interes en Latinoamerica. Aunque la region se ha sentido los
efectos de la crisis asiatica, ha salido mejor parada de lo que
esperaban muchos y ha recibido aplausos internacionales por tomar
las medidas de ajuste necesarias para compensar los efectos del
desastre. Muchas firmas asiaticas han comenzado a ampliar sus
operaciones en America Latina, justo cuando empresas de otros
paises hacen lo contrario.
 &HT;    Entre los ejemplos recientes de un mayor interes en la region
estan: una visita de 10 dias realizada en mayo a Argentina, Brasil
y Chile por una delegacion de destacados lideres empresariales de
Hong Kong. Esta ha sido la mayor y mas importante delegacion de
Hong Kong que visita Sudamerica, segun el Consejo de Fomento
Comercial de Hong Kong (TDC), que organizo el viaje.
 &HT;    ``Argentina, Brasil y Chile... representan un gran potencial no
aprovechado para el comercio bilateral y las inversiones con Hong
Kong,'' afirmo Michael Sze, director ejecutivo del TDC, despues del
viaje.
 &HT;    Una reunion sobre America Latina celebrada en Tokio a finales de
junio y principios de julio atrajo a mas de 750 empresarios. La
cita, organizada por el Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo y el
Banco de Importacion y Exportacion de Japon, fue inaugurada por el
entonces primer ministro Ryutaro Hashimoto, y entre los oradores
destacados estuvieron los presidentes de Peru, Alberto Fujimori, y
Julio Maria Sanguinetti, de Uruguay, asi como ministros clave de
Mexico, Colombia, Jamaica y Panama.
 &HT;    Desde Tokio, Fujimori viajo a Vietnam (la primera visita de un
presidente peruano a ese pais). Por su parte, Herminio Blanco,
secretario de Comercio de Mexico, inicio un viaje por Corea del
Sur, Taiwan y otros paises de la Cuenca del Pacifico, con el fin de
subrayar el interes del gobierno mexicano en las inversiones
asiaticas y contrarrestar los efectos de la crisis.
 &HT;    Por su parte, China envio en julio a su primer ministro, Qian
Qichen, a varios paises latinoamericanos con el objetivo de ampliar
las relaciones.
 &HT;    El ano pasado, antes de sentirse la fuerza de la crisis
asiatica, el comercio de Asia con Latinoamerica habia aumentado. El
comercio entre las siete mayores economias latinoamericanas mas
Panama (uno de los mayores socios comerciales de Asia), y las
cuatro mayores economias asiaticas, alcanzo US$50.300 millones, un
aumento del 7,4 por ciento sobre 1996, segun calculos de Latin
Trade basados en informacion del Fondo Monetario Internacional (ver
tabla). Taiwan, que tradicionalmente ha sido el quinto socio
comercial asiatico con Latinoamerica, prefirio no entregar
informacion detallada sobre la actividad comercial en 1997.
 &HT;    Japon es todavia el lider comercial indiscutido de Asia con
Latinoamerica. Su comercio con la region es mayor que el total de
America Latina con Corea, China y Hong Kong combinado. Aunque
crecio un respetable 11 por ciento, el comercio de Japon con
America Latina aumento a un ritmo menor que el de China y Hong
Kong, que incrementaron su actividad comercial con Latinoamerica en
un 24,7 por ciento y un 15,5 por ciento, respectivamente.
 &HT;    Entre los paises latinoamericanos, Brasil se mantiene en calidad
del primer socio comercial con Asia, con una ligera ventaja sobre
Panama. Esto se debe no a un auge del mercado panameno para los
bienes asiaticos o a las exportaciones panamenas a Asia, sino al
comercio de bienes en la Zona Libre de Colon, en la costa atlantica
de Panama. La zona libre panamena es la segunda a nivel mundial,
detras de Hong Kong, y comercia bienes por valor de miles de
millones de dolares al ano provenientes de Asia y los reexporta
hacia America Latina.
 &HT;    Es demasiado temprano para decir a que nivel quedara afectado
este ano el comercio entre Asia y America Latina. Se espera que
bajen las exportaciones de algunos paises latinoamericanos con
destino a Asia, debido a la reduccion del poder adquisitivo en esa
region, y que se produzca un aumeno de las importaciones
latinoamericanas de productos asiaticos debido a que valen menos
por la baja de sus divisas.
 &HT;    Incluso en el mejor de los casos, Asia queda muy por detras de
Estados Unidos y Europa en terminos de comercio e inversion en
America Latina. Muchas empresas asiaticas todavia ven la region con
mucho escepticismo y tienden a no realizar inversiones
sustanciales.
 &HT;    Michael Mortimore, autor de un informe de la CEPAL sobre las
inversiones extranjeras directas en America Latina, afirma que
Japon ``en lo esencial se ha mantenido ausente de la region.''
 &HT;    ``Los inversionistas japoneses tienen buena memoria, y sus
bancos perdieron mucho dinero cuando la crisis de la deuda
latinoamericana [en los anos 80],'' explica Mortimore.
 &HT;    A los japoneses tampoco les gusta el desorden general y la
violencia que impera en la region, asi como su falta de estabilidad
economica y politica, agrega.
 &HT;    Al mismo tiempo, muchos latinoamericanos muestran escepticismo
sobre los productos asiaticos. Para muchos consumidores,
especialmente en el Caribe, Centroamerica y los paises andinos, la
calidad es sinonimo de hecho en Estados Unidos. ``Estamos tratando
de cambiar esa manera de pensar,'' dice David George, portavoz del
Centro de Comercio de Corea en la Republica Dominicana, que se
inauguro el ano pasado. ``Hemos tenido que batallar para romper el
control [de los productos estadounidenses] en la Republica
Dominicana, pero hemos podido hacerlo vendiendo productos de
calidad a precios muy competitivos.''
 &HT;    Mexico. La empresa sudcoreana Samsung Corporation nunca ha
estado tan activa en este pais: suministra piezas y equipamiento a
una empresa mexicana que tiene un importante contrato de servicio
con Petroleos Mexicanos, y pudiera competir por contratos para
construir plantas generadoras para la Comision Federal de
Electricidad. Y lo que es mas prometedor, Samsung se presentara a
la licitacion de varios proyectos, por valor de varios millones de
dolares, para reconstruir numerosas refinerias de Pemex.
 &HT;    ``La crisis en Corea y Asia nos ha obligado a tratar de penetrar
el mercado mexicano, en particular, y el latinoamericano en
general,'' explica Alexander Braune Magallon, subgerente de
proyectos en la oficina de Samsung en Mexico DF. ``En Asia hay
demasiada oferta y la demanda no es suficiente. Eso hace que
America Latina se convierta en un mercado de mucho interes para
nosotros porque andamos en busca de nuevos proyectos para
reemplazar la demanda perdida en Asia,'' agrego.
 &HT;    Gran parte de las inversiones japonesas y coreanas han sido en
las maquiladoras a lo largo de la frontera mexicana con Estados
Unidos, que producen desde textiles hasta videograbadoras y
estereos. Samsung Electronics, por ejemplo, invirtio US$200
millones en construir una planta de televisores y monitores de
computadora en Tijuana en 1996, que ayudo a convertir a esta ciudad
en la capital mundial de los televisores. Samsung invertira una
cifra similar para ampliar la produccion, y otras empresas
asiaticas le han seguido los pasos.
 &HT;    Un vistazo rapido a las maquiladoras de Tijuana muestra las
plantas no solo de grandes empresas, como Samsung, Panasonic y
Sony, sino tambien de suministradores menos conocidos que han
mudado la produccion de Asia a Mexico.
 &HT;    Otra parte importante de las inversiones ha sido en el sector
automotriz. Nissan construyo una enorme planta en Aguascalientes a
finales de los anos 80, y desde entonces numerosos suministradores
japoneses han establecido operaciones locales. Hoy, mas de la mitad
de los componentes de los modelos Sentra que la Nissan produce aqui
(muchos se exportan a Estados Unidos) se fabrican en Mexico, segun
Angel Gomez, director de fomento economico de Aguascalientes.
 &HT;    Pero las oportunidades mas brillantes para las inversiones
asiaticas estan probablemente en los sustanciales contratos de
servicio que ya licitan o planean sacar a licitacion empresas como
Pemex y CFE. Las companias asiaticas han probado su fuerza en las
licitaciones de Pemex el ano pasado, cuando un grupo liderado por
Sunkyong Enterprises, de Corea, se llevo un enorme contrato para
reconstruir la refineria de Cadereyta, derrotando a un grupo rival
liderado por empresas japonesas.
 &HT;    ``Donde haya un proyecto, hay que aprovechar la oportunidad,''
dice Braune, de Samsung.
 &HT;    Mientras tanto, una importante empresa coreana cancelo
indefinidamente sus planes de construir una planta de piezas para
automoviles debido a la crisis en Corea, segun un funcionario de la
oficina en Mexico DF de Kuotro, la entidad coreana de inversion en
el extranjero. Muchas otras empresas de Corea y Japon han decidido
esperar y demorar sus proyectos hasta que la situacion en Asia se
estabilice.
 &HT;    El Banco de Fomento de Corea anuncio el cierre temporal de sus
oficinas en Mexico debido a la crisis en casa. La entidad habia
iniciado operaciones en Mexico para financiar las operaciones de
importacion y exportacion de grandes empresas coreanas.
 &HT;    Korea Telecom (KT) tambien ha decidido marcharse de Mexico. El
gigante coreano de las telecomunicaciones tenia una participacion
del 49 por ciento en Miditel, una pequena firma del mismo sector
dirigida por el empresario mexicano Antonio Kanahuati. Pero KT
decidio que no podia cumplir sus proyecciones de inversion en
Mexico (mas de US$1.000 millones durante los proximos anos) debido
a los problemas en casa. KT vendio por US$49,5 millones sus
acciones a los duenos mexicanos de Miditel.
 &HT;    Una vez que la crisis concluya, factores de largo plazo como el
TLC deben dinamizar las inversiones asiaticas en Mexico. Para que
toda clase de productos se consideren oficialmente fabricados en
Norteamerica, requeriran una proporcion cada vez mayor de
componentes fabricados en esa zona. Las empresas asiaticas todavia
usan una proporcion mayor de componentes de fuera de America del
Norte que las empresas de Estados Unidos y Canada, de manera que se
esperan nuevas inversiones a medida que las plantas asiaticas que
usan a Mexico como trampolin de exportaciones hacia Estados Unidos
batallan por retener un trato preferencial en las tarifas a tenor
con el TLC.
 &HT;    Un ejemplo es Aventec, una empresa conjunta liderada por
Sumitomo que este ano anuncio una inversion de US$50 millones para
entregar suministros a una planta de General Motors en Silao,
ciudad industrial en el estado central de Guanajuato. Sumitomo
invito a Hirotec, de Japon, y a Budd Co., de Detroit, a unirse a la
alianza y establecer sus primeras operaciones en Mexico. La planta
debe concluirse para mediados de 1999.
 &HT;    ``Esta clase de proyecto se planifica a largo plazo, y la crisis
no fue suficiente para descarrilarlo,'' apunto Gustavo Funakubo,
gerente de Sumitomo en Mexico DF.
 &HT;    Brasil. Aunque Sumitomo, fabricante japones de equipos pesados,
anuncio recientemente planes para invertir este ano US$25 millones
en Brasil con el fin de crear una filial en este pais sudamericano,
la empresa es una excepcion. Las inversiones asiaticas en Brasil se
han reducido, per no necesariamente debido a la falta de fondos
provenientes de Asia, sino tambien a que Brasil es una de las
economias latinoamericanas mas golpeadas por la crisis asiatica.
 &HT;    Cuando el gobierno brasileno ofrecio el ano pasado incentivos
fiscales atractivos a los fabricantes de autos que desearan
establecerse en las areas menos desarrolladas del pais, muchas
empresas asiaticas se lanzaron a anunciar ambiciosos planes de
inversion. Mas de la mitad de los 25 proyectos industriales que
tenian por fin industrializar las regiones norte, nordeste y
centrooriental de Brasil, provinieron de empresas de Japon, Corea
del Sur y China.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, ninguna de esas inversiones se ha materializado.
Asia Motors incluso fue multada por comenzar a importar autos a
tarifas menores antes de desembolsar el dinero para costruir la
primera planta brasilena en el estado de Bahia.
 &HT;    A pesar de las dificultades en casa y de las demoras de las
inversiones en Brasil, los ejecutivos locales de Asia Motors
sostienen que la planta, valorada en US$500 millones, comenzara a
operar el proximo ano.
 &HT;    Los infortunios de Asia Motors ilustran la tendencia contra la
que tienen que batallar las empresas asiaticas. ``El poderio de
estos paises esta en baja y sus inversiones bajaran aun mas,''
expreso Octavio de Barrios, director de Sobeet, un grupo de estudio
que se ha dedicado a analizar las inversiones directas en Brasil.
``La capacidad de inversion de Japon, y de economias emergentes
como Corea del Sur, se reduce. La tendencia es hacia una reduccion
en la inversion.''
 &HT;    Ademas de Asia Motors, los planes de la automotriz coreana
Hyundai tambien estan en peligro. El proyecto de invertir US$200

indefinidamente. Las automotrices japonesas estan en una etapa un

COURT UPHOLDS MILITARY'S BAN ON GAY ACTIVITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALAN FINDER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal appeals court Wednesday upheld the
military's longstanding ban on homosexual activity and its more
recent ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy, saying that the rules do
not violate homosexuals' constitutional rights because of the
special circumstances of the military.
</P>
<P>
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said that
individual rights traditionally have been curtailed in the armed
forces and that military officials' justifications for the policies
were rational because the policies promote unit cohesion, enhance
privacy and reduce sexual tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Courts are ill-suited to second-guess military judgments that
bear upon military capability or readiness,'' the three-member
appeals panel said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision overturned two rulings by a U.S. District judge in
Manhattan, who had struck down the ban on homosexual activity and
the ``don't ask, don't tell'' provision. Judge Eugene Nickerson
said the policies violated the constitutional guarantees of equal
protection and free speech, and that they discriminated against
homosexuals for no other reason than to cater to the prejudices of
heterosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the six military reservists who had challenged the
policies said they had not decided whether to ask the U.S. Supreme
Court to review the appeals court's decision. At least eight other
lawsuits challenging the policies have been filed in federal courts
around the country over the last few years, but none has been taken
up by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision basically gives to the military and Congress,
when it is acting on military matters, carte blanche to
discriminate,'' said Beatrice Dohrn, legal director of the Lambda
Legal Defense and Education Fund. Ms. Dohrn, along with the
American Civil Liberties Union, represents the military personnel
who filed that lawsuit in 1994. At the time, two of the plaintiffs
were on active duty and four were in the military reserves; all six
are now reservists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision is an example of a court saying, `We don't want
to look, we don't want to examine,''' Ms. Dohrn said.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Tom Begines, a Defense Department spokesman, declined
to comment on the court decision. He defended the provisions,
noting that they resulted from months of congressional hearings.
``The policy maintains the necessary balance between the
prohibition of homosexual conduct in the military and the privacy
rights of service members,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy was enacted by Congress in
1993 and went into effect the following year. It allows homosexuals
to serve in the armed forces as long as they keep their sexual
orientation private. Recruiters may not ask prospective members
about their sexual orientation, and commanders cannot investigate
homosexual activity unless they have first received compelling
evidence that it has occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The military also kept in effect a longstanding ban on
homosexual acts. Anyone found to have engaged in such activity _
including the holding of hands and conduct that takes place off
base and in private _ must be discharged.
</P>
<P>
   In challenging the policies, the six reservists said that the
military was discriminating against them, depriving them of
free-speech and equal-protection guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Nickerson struck down the ``don't tell'' provision in
1995, ruling that it violated free-speech provisions of the First
Amendment and catered to the fears and prejudices of heterosexual
troops.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He said Congress could not enact discriminatory legislation just
``to insulate heterosexual service members from statements that
might excite their prejudices.'' He also dismissed the government's
contention that morale and discipline would suffer if homosexual
men and women were allowed to serve openly in the military.
</P>
<P>
   The government appealed, and the court of appeals returned the
case to Nickerson, saying that he had also to determine whether the
military's ban on homosexual activity was constitutional. If the
provision against activity was found to be constitutional, the
appeals court said, then the ``don't tell, don't ask'' policy would
also pass constitutional muster.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Nickerson ruled that the ban on activity violated the
equal-protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment. ``The fact that
the prejudice arises in the military context does not legitimate
the discrimination,'' he wrote, becoming the first judge to
overturn the provision.
</P>
<P>
   But in its 23-page decision released Wednesday, the court of
appeals disagreed. The appeals panel found that senior military
leaders, in testimony before Congress, had offered ``adequate
justifications'' for the rule barring homosexual activity. The
panel also determined that the courts generally must pay ``great
deference to Congress in military matters.''
</P>
<P>
   While members of the armed forces are entitled to constitutional
protections, the judges said, federal courts have long found those
protections to be more limited in the military than in civilian
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``In full recognition that within the military individual rights
must of necessity be curtailed lest the military's mission be
impaired,'' the appeals judges wrote, ``courts have applied less
stringent standards to constitutional challenges to military rules,
regulations and procedures than they have in the civilian
context.''

THIS WEEK: THE LUTHERAN CHURCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORIGIN: Lutheran churches stem from the movement led by a Roman
Catholic priest, Martin Luther, in the 16th century. The name
Lutheran was a nickname for followers of the reformist Luther. His
``95 Theses,'' which criticized the abuse of religious indulgences
and were posted on a church door, widened the rift between Luther
and Roman Catholic leaders. In the 16th century, indulgences were
granted to excuse people from doing full penance for certain sins.
Luther, who lived from 1483-1546, emphasized the concept of
salvation by grace through faith alone. The movement spread from
Germany and Scandinavia and spearheaded the rise of many branches
of Protestant Christianity. The earliest American Lutherans came
mainly from Germany and Scandinavia. The church in this country
grew rapidly from 1850-60, when about 1 million people came to the
United States from Germany.
</P>
<P>
   MEMBERSHIP: There are about 70 million Lutherans worldwide. The
two largest Lutheran bodies in the United States are the
Chicago-based Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, with 5.2
million members, and the St. Louis-based Lutheran Church, Missouri
Synod, with 2.6 million members.
</P>
<P>
   BELIEFS: Lutherans believe that salvation is a gift from God and
comes through grace by faith alone, not by works. Faith in Christ,
they believe, begins new life in an individual. Also, they hold
that the authority of the Bible is more important than church
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   RITUALS: Lutherans retained many of the elements of the medieval
Roman Catholic Church, making only those changes they believed were
in conflict with teachings of the Bible. They retained the
Christian Mass with the traditional altar, cross, candles and
vestments. But Communion is seen less as a necessary sacrifice and
more as an encounter between the believer and God. Whereas Roman
Catholics teach the doctrine of ``transubstantiation,'' the belief
that the wine and bread become the body and blood of Jesus,
Lutherans teach that the body and blood of Jesus are present, but
that no physical changes take place in the bread and wine.

BRITISH TO PRESS IRAN ON RUSHDIE AT THURSDAY MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By SARAH LYALL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The British government said Wednesday that it would
continue to press Iran to lift the death sentence against the
author Salman Rushdie when its foreign secretary, Robin Cook, meets
the Iranian foreign minister in New York on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working to achieve a resolution to the problem that is
going to be acceptable to both sides,'' said a spokesman for the
Foreign Office. ``We've always taken the opportunity to press for
assurances of Salman Rushdie's safety, and that is what Robin Cook
will be doing when he meets Kamal Kharazi tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Iran's president, Mohammad Khatami, seemed to signal a softening
of Iran's position on Tuesday, when he told reporters in New York
that ``we should consider the Salman Rushdie affair as completely
finished.''
</P>
<P>
   But Britain has always insisted that nothing short of a complete
lifting of the death sentence, as well as the revocation of the
$2.5 million bounty on Rushdie's head pledged by a revolutionary
foundation in Tehran, would be an acceptable solution.
</P>
<P>
   After he wrote the novel ``The Satanic Verses,'' Rushdie was
accused of blasphemy against Islam and condemned to death in a
religious decree by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in 1989. Since
then, he has lived in safe houses around London, guarded around the
clock by British agents.
</P>
<P>
   Rushdie and several representatives from the International
Rushdie Defense Committee met with members of the Foreign Office on
Wednesday and the committee issued a statement saying that it
remained ``cautiously optimistic'' about Thursday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Iranian government has said in the past that it
would not actively encourage anyone to kill Rushdie, it has never
explicitly revoked the death sentence, nor canceled the bounty.

OZAWA SIDELINED FOR OPENING-NIGHT CONCERT  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Seiji Ozawa, knocked out by a viral infection he
contracted in Russia last week and running a temperature of 103.5,
was unable to conduct the opening-night concert of his
25th-anniversary season with the Boston Symphony Orchestra
Wednesday night. Robert Shaw flew in from Atlanta to conduct the
performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony without rehearsal. Shaw
was scheduled to arrive at 4 p.m., meet with the soloists, change
clothes, and then go onstage for the 6:30 concert.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa, music director of the BSO, was scheduled for blood work
at Massachusetts General Hospital Wednesday afternoon. He has
probably not taken a day off since late June. Following his
extensive commitments to Tanglewood and the Tanglewood Music
Center, Ozawa, 63, flew to Japan for the labor-intensive Saito
Kinen Festival. From Japan, Ozawa went to Moscow and St. Petersburg
at the invitation of Mstislav Rostropovich to participate in
concerts intended to encourage detente between Russia and Japan and
the return of the Kurile Islands to Japan. Ozawa arrived in Boston
at 1 a.m. Monday feeling unwell, and immediately called his doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa hopes to recover in time to conduct Sunday afternoon's
free performance of Beethoven's Ninth on Boston Common, an event
that is scheduled to be taped for television.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement read at a press conference Wednesday by Boston
Pops conductor laureate John Williams, Ozawa said, ``It breaks my
heart not to be able to conduct tonight. If there was any way I
could do it, I would, but I am too sick. I apologize to all of you
that I have to cancel. Please know I am doing my best to get well
by Sunday. That concert is my personal thank-you to the citizens of
Boston for all their support of me and the BSO for so many years.
Let's hope for good weather for us _ and the Red Sox. I pray I am
able to thank you all with music soon.''
</P>
<P>
   BSO artistic adviser Anthony Fogg said Emmanuel Villaume, a
young French conductor who had assisted Ozawa during the Saito
Kinen Festival production of Poulenc's ``Les Mamelles de Tiresias''
two years ago, had agreed to fly to Boston to conduct the
all-Berlioz subscription concerts with baritone Jose van Dam Friday
and Saturday nights. Villaume has conducted widely in opera at the
European and American Spoleto festivals, and has had engagements at
Covent Garden, La Scala, the Opera Bastille, the San Francisco
Opera, and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In agreeing to replace Ozawa, Shaw, at 82 the dean of leading
American conductors, was returning a favor. Last summer an ailing
Shaw had to cancel a Tanglewood appearance on short notice, and
Ozawa was one of the three conductors who replaced him. In 1996,
Shaw returned to Tanglewood at Ozawa's invitation after an absence
of 49 years, and in 1997 closed the season with a particularly
memorable account of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, a work he has been
associated with since he prepared the Collegiate Chorale for a
historic performance by Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony in
1945.

EUROPEAN COURT REBUKES BRITAIN IN CASE OF STEPFATHER BEATING BOY
</HEADLINE>
   (cb) 
 By SARAH LYALL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In a sharp rebuke, the European Court of Human Rights
ruled on Wednesday that Britain had failed to protect adequately a
9-year-old boy who was repeatedly struck with a bamboo garden stake
by his stepfather.
</P>
<P>
   While the decision stops short of making it illegal for parents
to spank their children, it means that Britain will have to rewrite
its corporal punishment law.
</P>
<P>
   After the beating took place five years ago, the stepfather was
charged with assault and tried in a British court. He was acquitted
after arguing that because his actions had taken place after the
boy had threatened his brother with a kitchen knife, they
represented ``reasonable chastisement'' under British law.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the boy, who suffered welts on his thighs and
buttocks, appealed to the European Court of Human Rights in
Strasbourg, France, maintaining that Britain had failed to protect
his human rights.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision Wednesday, the court said the British government
was obligated to protect children and ``other vulnerable
individuals,'' as well as adults, from assault and ill treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor government said it welcomed the ruling _ which stemmed
from a case brought against the previous Tory government _ and
would soon begin exploring ways of reforming the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a common-sense decision, which I welcome,'' said
Health Minister Paul Boateng. ``Any case of serious violence
against a child, and specifically in this instance, where a young
boy was being repeatedly and severely beaten at home, would horrify
parents.''
</P>
<P>
   But Boateng emphasized that the ruling did not mean an end to
parental spanking, or smacking, as Britons call it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has nothing to do with the issue of smacking,'' he said.
``The overwhelming majority of parents know the difference between
smacking and beating. They know how to insure good social behavior
in a loving and caring way, and we respect that right.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Tory opposition said that the ruling would hamstring
parents' ability to discipline their children properly and said it
was another sorry example of Britain being emasculated by European
laws. In the last several years, British laws have been regularly
overturned by Europe as being in violation of the European
Convention on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents must be allowed to use reasonable punishment to
discipline their children,'' said Ann Widdecombe, the health
secretary in the Tories' shadow cabinet. ``Of course, parents must
not use excessive force on their children, but there are already
laws in place against assault and other such actions which protect
children and adults alike.''
</P>
<P>
   And Teddy Taylor, a Tory member of Parliament and one of the
opposition's most vociferous opponents of strong British ties to
Europe, said, ``This latest decision is a terrible disappointment,
because it simply shows that the scope for decision making is being
ground down slowly, almost every day, by these European courts.''
</P>
<P>
   It is illegal to beat children in private and state schools
here, but Britain has held firm in maintaining a parent's right to
spank. A number of European countries _ Denmark, Finland, Norway,
Sweden, Austria, Cyprus, Croatia and Latvia _ have banned corporal
punishment outright.
</P>
<P>
   Children's advocacy groups welcomed Wednesday's ruling, which
also ordered Britain to pay the boy $50,400 in damages and legal
costs, but added that they wished that it had gone further and made
all corporal punishment illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are concerned about is that the government might only
offer a small step in changing the law,'' said Joanne Bailey, a
spokeswoman for Save the Children here. ``We're saying: `Forget
clarification of the law. Let's have an outright ban on physical
punishment and insure that parents feel adequately supported so
that they know there are options, other than hitting a kid, of
disciplining.''' &QL;

PAKISTANI LEADER SAYS HE WILL SIGN NUCLEAR TEST BAN TREATY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Pakistan's prime minister said on Wednesday
that he would sign a treaty banning nuclear testing within the next
year, putting the onus on India to follow suit or be left with
North Korea as the only nations refusing to curb their nuclear
weapons ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif linked the decision, announced in a
speech to the General Assembly on Wednesday, to a lifting of
sanctions imposed on both India and Pakistan after nuclear tests in
May. American officials said that President Clinton told Sharif in
a meeting on Monday that there can be no general waiver of
sanctions until Pakistan acts, but the administration welcomed
Sharif's decision, even if hedged.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif announced his decision only hours after a lunch meeting
with India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, in which the two
leaders agreed on a series of steps to reduce tensions between
their countries. India suggested it would respond to the Pakistani
testing initiative on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan's intention to sign the treaty would be the first step
toward ending a new nuclear arms race in South Asia that began when
India and then Pakistan shocked the world by setting off a series
of explosions.
</P>
<P>
   For the past several months, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott has been trying to persuade Indian and Pakistani officials
to follow up pledges not to conduct more tests by putting their
signatures on the test-ban treaty within a certain time limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The within-a-year part is something that Strobe has been
working overtime to try and nail down,'' said Michael Krepon,
president of the Henry L. Stimson Center, a military research
organization in Washington. What Pakistan announced, he said,
amounted to ``a time-bound framework, a declaration of intent.''
</P>
<P>
   At their meeting on Wednesday, the two prime ministers agreed to
resume high-level talks on the disputed territory of Kashmir, which
have been in abeyance for more than a year. But Kashmir, now
divided between the two countries and not recognized by the United
Nations as belonging to either, will be only one of a number of
subjects on the agenda when negotiations open in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders also decided on Wednesday to activate a hot line
between them, improve transportation links between their countries
and put an end to sporadic firing across a cease-fire line in
Kashmir, which is killing people on both sides. Vajpayee hailed the
talks as the opening of ``a new chapter in Indo-Pakistani
cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither leader showed any sign of budging from long-held
positions on how to settle Kashmir's future, with Vajpayee refusing
to condone any outside help in negotiating the issue and Sharif
renewing calls for the United Nations to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians accuse the Pakistanis of arming and training rebels
in the Kashmir Valley, an area with a Muslim majority that has been
in revolt against Indian rule since 1989. The Pakistanis charge
India with repression and the deaths of thousands of Kashmiris
under Indian army rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Custodial killings, disappearances, arbitrary arrests, summary
executions continue to be daily occurrences,'' Sharif said on
Wednesday in his speech to the General Assembly. ``The nightmare of
the Kashmiri people continues.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Sharif spoke in the General Assembly there had been
reports in Pakistan that he would move closer to signing the 1996
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which Pakistanis have always said
they would not do until India signed.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan voted for the treaty at a U.N. conference in 1996;
India did not. The Indians tried to block its approval but were
overwhelmingly out-voted and lost friends in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   Asked on Wednesday if India was now ready to sign also, Vajpayee
told reporters they would have to wait until they heard his speech
on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif chose his one-year time frame for signing the treaty
deliberately. In September 1999, the nations that have adhered to
the treaty _ 150 to date _ will meet to review it. The test ban
will come into force then, but only if all 44 nations with nuclear
reactors have signed and ratified.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has signed the treaty, but President Clinton
has not yet sent it to the Senate for ratification.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan wants to be part of the 1999 conference to prevent the
rules from changing if India holds out against the treaty. Some
nations have suggested that in order to avoid a slow death of the
treaty, it might be necessary to overlook India and North Korea and
allow the treaty to go into effect with ratifications from only 42
nuclear-capable nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pakistan will oppose any attempt to change this fundamental
requirement,'' Sharif said, adding, ``Such a change can only be
made by consensus.'' He also said that if India resumed nuclear
testing at any time, Pakistan would review its decision to join the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the possible pitfalls on the road ahead, Pakistan's
decision was welcomed on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since the nuclear tests in South Asia in May 1998, I have
consistently urged India and Pakistan to sign the CTBT,'' U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a statement. ``The government
of Pakistan is to be commended for heeding the concern of the
international community.'' &QL;

GREENSPAN HINTS AT FED INTEREST RATE CUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan warned
Wednesday that the global financial crisis threatened to stall the
nation's long boom, and hinted that the central bank was prepared
to cut interest rates to keep the economy growing.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's comments _ his strongest to date on a global crisis
that still seems like distant thunder to most Americans _ set off a
rally on Wall Street, where investors had been begging for a rate
cut to help reverse a painful slide in stock prices since July. The
Dow Jones industrial average jumped 257 points, or 3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While just a few months ago, global problems appeared to be
easing, ``the most recent, more virulent phase of the crisis has
infected our markets,'' the Fed chairman said in prepared testimony
to the Senate Budget Committee. ``We're fraying at the edges,'' he
said later in answer to a question.
</P>
<P>
   ``As these things go, these are about as blunt statements as you
ever get from the chairman,'' said Robert V. DiClemente, co-head of
US economic research for Salomon Smith Barney in New York.
</P>
<P>
   DiClemente and other economists predicted the Fed would cut
short-term interest rates by one quarter of a percentage point when
its governing board, the Federal Open Market Committee, meets
Tuesday. Only a few weeks ago, most analysts thought that the
central bank would not act until late this year at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Greenspan's apparent readiness to cut rates now reflects a
growing edginess on the part of US policymakers about the depth and
dangers of the global turmoil that began last summer as a real
estate bust and currency tumble in Thailand and has since spread to
much of Asia, Russia, and Latin America. It also reflects a
remarkable about-face by Fed officials, who as recently as mid-July
were contemplating raising rates to slow the economy in order to
protect against incipient inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of people would look at current conditions and say, `Hold
on, isn't this just what the Fed chairman has been saying he wanted
_ slower growth and some cooling of the stock market?' and they'd
be right,'' remarked Richard B. Berner, chief economist with Mellon
Bank in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the circumstances are changing so quickly,'' said Berner.
``We're in the midst of the most serious global financial crisis in
decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan seemed to go out of his way Wednesday to emphasize the
fast-changing nature of events. He originally declined an
invitation to testify before the Senate Budget Committee, but then
reversed himself and appeared, according to panel staffers. In his
prepared remarks, he indicated that global conditions had worsened
even since his Sept. 4 speech at the University of California at
Berkeley, where he first acknowledged that world financial troubles
were affecting the US and revealed that Fed officials had shifted
from their traditional inflation-fighting stance to one of worrying
equally about slowing growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since then,'' he told the Senate panel, ``deteriorating
foreign economies and their spillover to domestic markets have
increased the possibility'' of a US slowdown. At another point, he
warned that global instability had boosted the need for fast action
``to prevent the contagion from really spilling over and creating
some very significant further difficulties for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other signs besides Greenspan's testimony Wednesday
of the extraordinary conditions with which policymakers belive they
are dealing.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, officials with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
sought to orchestrate an unusual loan package for Long-Term Capital
Management LP, a hedge fund whose partners include Nobel laureates
Myron Scholes and Robert Merton that recently announced it had lost
$2.5 billion, or about half its assets, in trading last month.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge funds are private investment vehicles catering to the
wealthy that engage in risky trading in stocks and options.
</P>
<P>
   Observers said the New York Fed's involvement was unusual
because the fund's investors are among the most sophisticated in
the country and, under normal condition, would be left to absorb
whatever losses they sustained. But they speculated the New York
Fed worries that the fund's collapse could shake the confidence of
other, more conventional investors.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of the Greenwich, Conn., firm and a consortium of
banks were meeting Wednesday evening, and a New York Fed spokesman
said that a statement might be issued later in the night. The
negotiations were first reported Wednesday by cable network CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Stock investors were certainly buoyed by Greenspan's hint of an
interest rate cut. The Dow average gained 257.21 points, or 3.3
percent, to close at 8154.41, its first close above 8100 since late
August. The broader Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was also up, rising
36.46 points, or 3.5 percent, to close at 1066.09. Meanwhile the
technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index climbed 62.47 points, or
3.7 percent, to close at 1760.27.
</P>
<P>
   An interest rate cut is considered good news for stocks because
it would reduce borrowing costs for US companies and consumers,
helping to sustain growth. Perhaps as important, it would be
interpreted as a signal that the central bank is ready to guide the
economy if it runs into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Bond investors did not respond quite as enthusiastically to the
Fed chairman's comments as their counterparts in the stock market.
While the price of short-term Treasury securities rallied, the
bellweather 30-year US Treasury bond slid, raising the yield or
market interest rate on it to 5.16 percent from 5.15 percent
Tuesday. The benchmark bond had soared in price in recent weeks as
investors sought out its relative safety amid volatile swings in
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   If the Fed acts next Tuesday, it is likely to shave the
overnight bank lending rate from 5.50 percent to 5.25 percent. Such
a reduction would be the first interest rate change by the central
bank in 18 months and the first rate cut in more than two and a
half years.

BAYER TO FUND GENOMICS RESEARCH AT MILLENNIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one of the largest alliances ever forged in the field of drug
discovery, Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc. said Wednesday it will
receive up to $465 million from Germany's Bayer AG to fund research
and to buy a stake in the Cambridge company.
</P>
<P>
   Bayer, Germany's No. 2 chemicals and drug manufacturer, will pay
$368 million over five years for access to Millennium's drug
discovery research, which is based on genomics, the study of genes
and their role in various diseases. In addition, Bayer will become
Millennium's largest corporate investor, spending $97 million for a
14 percent stake in the five-year-old Cambridge, Mass. company that
has only sporadically made money.
</P>
<P>
   Millennium's genomics technology sifts through hundreds of
thousands of proteins, or ``drug targets'', that are used to
identify and develop drugs. The technology lets companies radically
speed up drug discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Millennium will deliver 225 genomics-based
proteins over the next five years. Those compounds will target
cardiovascular diseases, cancer, osteoporosis, pain, liver
fibrosis, hematology and viral infections.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Bayer, best known for its aspirin and One-a-Day vitamins, will
then conduct extensive testing and genetic screening to find lead
proteins that it could develop into drugs. Bayer will pay royalties
to Millennium for any drugs it markets that were identified through
the partnership. Among compounds Bayer does not pursue, Millennium
can select drug targets for its own development.
</P>
<P>
   For Millennium, the deal is a major coup that also helps boost
genomics. The Bayer money will increase Millennium's potential
research funding from corporate partners to $1 billion, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal helps us continue our leadership in drug
discovery,'' said Levin.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Millennium the deal with Bayer is phenomenally lucrative
even though Bayer will cherry pick their favcorite targets,'' said
Scott Sacane, managing director at NationsBanc Montgomery
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   For Bayer, whose prescription pharmaceuticals business is ranked
No. 14 globally, the heavy commitment to Millennium is a relatively
quick _ and expensive _ way to regain ground lost to other large
competitors who have beefed up through acquisitions and alliances.
</P>
<P>
   Several other genomics companies have made drug discovery deals
with pharmaceutical companies that have averaged only $39 million,
according to Matthew N. Murray, a senior biotech analysts at Lehman
Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bayer is a very solid player in the pharmaceutical development
industry, but a step or two behind (in) the new drug discovery
technology that Millennium has,'' said Sacane. ``So the cost of
being a couple of years late and the cost of doing business with
the best genomics company in the field is expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This alliance is a key strategic move which will enable us to
develop innovative drugs and bring them to market more quickly and
cost-effectively,'' said Horst Meyer, general manager of Bayer
Pharmaceuticals Business Group.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Bayer &UR;  &LR; announced a $1.1 billion deal to acquire
the diagnostic division of Chiron Corp., a  &UR;  &LR; biotechnology company
based in Emeryville, Calif., in an effort to bolster its medical
products and testing business. The unit is based in Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   That acquistion came after Bayer announced plans to sell most of
its Agfa film division next year in a public offering that some
Wall Street analysts expect could command as much as $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Levin, who expects the deal to close by year end, said the Bayer
money will enable Millennium to become profitable for the year and
increase its cash on hand to $160 million.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Besides the Bayer deal, Millennium's other partnership deals
total about $700 million, with companies such as &UR;  &LR; Hoffman-La Roche,
Eli Lilly, Astra, the Wyeth-Ayerst division of American Home
Products, Monsanto and Pfizer &UR; . &LR;  Wednesday Levin said the first
drugs from these partners will enter pre-clinical or animal trials
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Millennium's shares Wednesday closed at 18 11/16, up 1 7/16 in
heavy trading of 3.6 million shares. The stock has climbed 8 1/8
since Sept. 10.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Speaker Newt Gingrich brushing aside talk of a
censure deal with President Clinton, Democrats on Wednesday called
for a quick resolution of House impeachment proceedings while
Republicans held out for slow and deliberate investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The sparring over a timetable began in a meeting Wednesday
morning between Gingrich and Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House minority
leader, and spilled out into another daylong set of rival news
conferences. Seeking to capitalize on the public's exhaustion with
the story of Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, the Democrats pushed for
the House to complete any inquiry in little more than 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not in a world today where we can sit here in suspended
animation as a country for eight and nine and 10 and 12 months,''
said Gephardt, ``while we pore over this day after day after day
before we can make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gingrich and Republican members of the House Judiciary
Committee resisted setting any time line or making any deal with
the president. ``I don't understand how people can rush to a
solution before they finish the investigation,'' the speaker said.
``I just think there's an awful lot we don't know yet and there's
an awful lot of evidence that hasn't been gathered yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich also said the length of deliberations ``depends for
example on whether the president instructs his staff to testify. It
depends on whether the attitude is obstruction or the attitude is
cooperation. And I think at the moment we don't know what will
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   An aide later said the speaker wanted to see Bruce Lindsey, a
deputy White House counsel, cooperate with the ongoing
investigation of Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel.
A White House claim of lawyer-client privilege for Lindsey is now
pending before the U.S. Supreme Court, and the grand jury hearing
the Lewinsky matter is still meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The day's partisan battling came as the House Judiciary
Committee was to meet again on Friday to continue trying to
determine what more to release and what to delete from 16 remaining
boxes sent by Starr. Although Gingrich said he was trying to meet
some Democratic concerns, the two parties appeared to be settling
into a permanent war footing over impeachment just a month before
national midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting of the Republican House leadership Wednesday, the
group asserted that the Constitution does not give Congress a way
to punish the president short of impeachment. ``The Constitution is
very specific,'' said Rep. Tom DeLay, the majority whip. ``Either
we impeach him or we do not impeach him. Any other kind of
punishment would be unconstitutional. You can't send the president
to jail. You can't fine the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich on Wednesday dismissed the significance of polls that
had shown Clinton's job-approval ratings rising after the broadcast
of his videotaped grand jury testimony on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people would be, frankly, horrified if the Congress
was simply a polling institution that enacted a grotesque version
of justice based on the latest poll or talk show,'' he said. The
Georgia Republican added, ``I don't understand how people can rush
to a solution before they finish the investigation. I just think
there's an awful lot we don't know yet and there's an awful lot of
evidence that hasn't been gathered yet.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the House's original 363-63 vote to
release Starr's report charging Clinton with 11 potentially
impeachable offenses, Democrats appeared to be starting to coalesce
behind a common strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, two Democrats who have been sharply critical of
the president, seconded Gephardt's call for speedy proceedings.
``What we've seen is of limited scope,'' Sen. Dianne Feinstein,
D-Calif., said of Starr's inquiry into the president. ``And with a
limited scope, there's an opportunity for the Judiciary Committee
to be prompt and wrap it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., who is in a tough re-election fight,
said, ``The most important thing we can do now is move it along.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Mike McCurry, the president's press
secretary, returned to the tactic the White House had used
effectively two years ago in painting Gingrich as an extremist. He
accused Gingrich of controlling the impeachment process and of
``stringing this matter out forever and ever.''
</P>
<P>
   He indicated that the president would be willing to accept some
kind of punishment to put the scandal behind him, saying Clinton
``understands there's more punishment he's likely going to
receive.'' McCurry said that some Republicans were receptive to
some kind of sanctions short of impeachment, but ``not many of them
are willing to say so publicly because they fly in the face of the
jihad caucus of their own party.''
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's meeting of Gingrich and Gephardt and several of
their lieutenants, Gingrich indicated that the House could yet
expand the scope of an inquiry beyond Clinton's affair with Monica
Lewinsky, depending on whether Starr took further actions.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt complained afterward that Democrats did not believe
that Starr's impeachment report ``launches a fishing expedition
into every possible wrong that's gone on anywhere in the world over
the last six years.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said that in rebuffing a time line, the speaker noted
that Lindsey had yet to finish testifying before the grand jury,
that Attorney General Janet Reno might yet appoint an independent
counsel to investigate campaign finance and that the House is
trying to determine whether campaign donations influenced U.S.
policy on satellite missile technology to China.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of how polarized the House has become, Gephardt held
his own news conference instead of appearing jointly with Gingrich
as the two had done two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans on Wednesday also began positioning
themselves for advantage over the evidence that is yet to be
released. One Republican official said that Republicans on the
Judiciary Committee had considered blocking the release of Linda
Tripp's tape recordings of her conversations with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has said he is investigating whether Mrs. Tripp lied under
oath when she said no duplicates were made of the tapes. The Starr
report to Congress noted that several tapes showed signs of
duplication. Democrats believe the tapes could help their case with
the public. But the Republicans backed away from barring their
release so as not to give the Democrats another opening to charge
that exculpatory materials were being held back.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt on Wednesday also called for Starr to turn over to
Congress any materials still in his custody on the Lewinsky
investigation. He said it might contain material favorable to the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Abbe Lowell, the chief investigative counsel for Judiciary
Democrats, said Starr had held onto 20 boxes of material, including
one-quarter of the grand jury transcripts and one-half of the FBI
interviews in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Gephardt late Wednesday, Starr said that the
House had received all materials ``substantially related'' to his
charges of possible impeachable offenses,'' and held back
``incidental, tangential materials.'' He said that he had been
``overly inclusive'' in what he provided the House. He said that if
the House wanted additional information, ``we stand ready to
provide the materials in accordance with our obligations under
court rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's letters also disputed White House contentions that he
had omitted from his report Ms. Lewinsky's assertion that she was
never told to lie about her relationship with Clinton. He cited two
passages in which the report summarized that she had told
prosecutors and the grand jury that ``the president never
explicitly told her to lie.''

TALKS ON TO SAVE HEDGE FUND COMPANY BESET BY HUGE BOND LOSSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of Wall Street's original masters of the universe
appears to be falling to earth.
</P>
<P>
   Creditors of Long-Term Capital Management LP, a hedge fund run
by John Meriwether, a former chairman of Salomon Brothers, are in
talks to try to salvage the firm beset by losses in its huge bond
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting Wednesday afternoon at the offices of the New York
Federal Reserve Bank in downtown Manhattan, 16 commercial banks and
brokerage firms that are Long-Term Capital's creditors tried to
hammer out the details of what could be a $4 billion loan to
stabilize the firm and prevent a forced liquidation of the fund's
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the bailout were not given. But bankers say that the
institutions _ including Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Morgan
Stanley, J.P. Morgan, Chase Manhattan Bank and United Bank of
Switzerland among others _ agreed to put up roughly $250 million
each in return for an equity stake in Long-Term Capital. It is
believed that existing equity holders, also known as limited
partners, would end up with a greatly diminished ownership in the
firm, between 10 percent and 20 percent of their original stakes. A
spokesman for Long-Term Capital declined to comment on Wednesday's
developments.
</P>
<P>
   It is extremely unusual for the Federal Reserve Bank to get
involved in the bailout of a hedge fund on the brink. Doug Tillett,
a spokesman for the New York Fed had no comment on Wednesday's
meeting. But for the Fed to convene the meetings and push for a
solution to Meriwether's problems reveals that the regulator is
deeply concerned about the impact an unwinding of Long-Term Capital
would have on brokerage firms already struggling with monumental
losses in emerging market bonds, junk debt and more recently
mortgage backed-securities.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators in the past have encouraged creditors and borrowers
to work together to avoid the kind of panic selling of a portfolio
that could harm other investors in a particular market. For
example, during the downturn in real estate in the early 1990s, the
Fed has asked banks to work with developers on the ropes. After the
Crash of 1987, the Fed provided liquidity to securities firms which
might have been on shaky ground.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term Capital is a hedge fund, a virtually unregulated
investment firm aimed at wealthy individuals or institutions that
speculate in high-risk trades in markets around the world. Like
many hedge funds, Long-Term Capital made its bets on borrowed
money. At times the value of its positions exceeded its capital by
50, even 100 times. Recently, for example, Meriwether's firm was
said to be holding positions worth $90 billion, while its capital,
as of September 2, stood at $2.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For the Fed to get involved with a speculator like Meriwether is
an indication that this time around, the asset of greatest concern
is not commercial real estate or stocks. This time it is bonds.
</P>
<P>
   What has hurt Long-Term Capital has hammered many investment
firms who are big players in bond markets around the world, and it
started about two months ago. As turmoil in Russia grew,
culminating with the country's de facto default on debt and its
devaluation of the ruble, investors fled risky securities such as
emerging market debt and junk bonds. Where these investors took
refuge was the United States Treasury market; prices of these notes
and bonds rocketed, driving yields to record lows.
</P>
<P>
   This confluence of events hurt Meriwether who had been a big
buyer of riskier bonds. The firm had also sold Treasury securities
it did not own in the belief these prices would fall as also as a
hedge for its non-Treasury bond holdings. When Treasury prices rose
Meriwether wound up on the losing end of both sides of his trades.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed may have been prompted to act quickly on the Long-Term
Capital problem because it realized that many of the world's hedge
funds and most of the big brokerage firm trading houses have
hundreds of millions of dollars in trades on their books that are
dead ringers for those skewering Meriwether. Said one trader: ``The
Fed is aware of the precarious position that exists among the
largest dealers who have positions in virtually every fixed income
product versus Treasuries. If Long-Term Capital had to take off its
trades all the hedge funds and dealers would be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because having a seller liquidating billion-dollar
positions in these markets would drive them even lower than they
now are. This could cause other failures among hedge funds and make
dealer firms' losses spiral, causing another wave of selling.

NEW YORK: of selling. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even without panic selling, things have been plenty bad for
Long-Term Capital since August. At the beginning of the year, the
firm had around $4.8 billion in capital. By September 2, that
capital had dwindled down to $2.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   His losses mounting, Meriwether wrote a three-page letter to his
investors. He explained that his fund was down 44 percent during
the month of August alone and was off 52 percent for the year. The
lion's share of the losses _ 82 percent _ came in so-called
relative value trades, a specialty of Meriwether's, which identify
small differences between, say, a futures price on a particular
bond and its corresponding price in the open market. The remaining
18 percent was lost in directional trades, in which Long-Term bet
on a certain issue, up or down. Included in this group was losses
in emerging markets, including Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Meriwether affirmed his belief in the trades his
firm had made and called the market environment ``unusually
attractive.'' With that attractiveness in mind, Meriwether asked
investors to consider making additional investments to the firm.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, no one did. Indeed, at about this time, the
firm went to Soros Fund Management asking for an infusion of $500
million. The request was denied.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks since Meriwether wrote his letter, the market has
hammered Long-Term Capital relentlessly. Treasuries have kept
rising and all other debt has continued to lag. Even if he did not
try to unwind some of his trades, having to mark his positions to
market each night meant that his paper losses required more
capital.
</P>
<P>
   On September 2, the 5-year note traded at a yield of 4.94
percent; Wednesday it was at 4.48 percent. The 10-year Treasury was
at 5.068 on September 2 and Wednesday it closed at 4.67 percent.
These are the issues that Long-Term Capital had likely sold short,
so that meant for Meriwether, September was even worse than the
``painful'' August he wrote investors about.
</P>
<P>
   It was no surprise, then, that in recent days, bond traders have
suspected Meriwether and his associates of trying to unload some of
their holdings to meet margin requirements. Last Friday, for
example, Long-Term Capital bought a slew of Treasury futures to
unwind one side of a huge trade. The buying moved the market in
that particular issue by 0.01 percent, a big move in the world's
deepest, most liquid securities market.
</P>
<P>
   Meriwether, of course, has faced adversity before. He left his
position as chairman of Salomon Brothers in 1991 after Paul Mozer,
one of the firm's Treasury traders was caught trying to corner the
market in 2-year Treasury securities. Meriwether formed Long-Term
Capital in 1994, along with Salomon Brothers alumni Lawrence
Hillebrand and Eric Rosenfeld, and Robert Merton and Myron Scholes,
both Nobel Laureates in economics. With its stable of star traders,
Long-Term Capital attracted money from banks, brokerages and
wealthy individuals, all of whom agreed to lock up their
investments until at the earliest the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's investors reads like a Who's Who on Wall Street.
Meriwether and his associates put up 35 percent of the firm's
capital, Merrill Lynch, which also raised much of the money for
Long-Term Capital when the firm set up shop, was a big investor.
Bear Stearns' president James Cayne reportedly put in $10 million
and many of Paine Webber's top executives invested in the fund.
National City Corp., a bank holding firm in Cleveland, Ohio, is
also an investor. Returns at the fund have been around 20.8 percent
per year, net of fees. Not much better than an index fund with a
lot more risk.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Long-Term Capital rides out this storm, the hedge fund
world will probably never be the same. Investors will likely flee
all such funds and regulators will probably scrutinize their
operations a lot more closely.

GREENSPAN SUGGESTS RATE CUT IS UNDER CONSIDERATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also FED-ECONSCENE) 
(mk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman,
suggested Wednesday that the central bank would seriously consider
cutting interest rates next week because of the deepening world
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to bring the existing instabilities to a level of
stability reasonably shortly, to prevent the contagion from really
spilling over and creating some very significant further
difficulties for all of us,'' Greenspan told the Senate Budget
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   His comments sent the stock market up strongly, and the Dow
Jones industrial average closed 257.21 points higher, or 3.26
percent, to 8,154.41, its strongest level since the 512.61-point
plunge Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, who as usual left himself some wiggle room, hedged
his comments by observing that the American economy remains strong
and unemployment low, a combination that would normally lead the
Federal Reserve to worry about inflation. And in a nod to members
of the central bank's policy-making committee who might be
reluctant to cut rates when they meet on Tuesday, he emphasized
that the decision was not his alone.
</P>
<P>
   But in his clearest warning yet that the global crisis is
threatening the nation's long economic expansion, Greenspan ticked
off a series of developments over the past several months that
could slow growth in the United States. They included the decline
in the stock market, a reduction in lending by banks and a general
rise in uncertainty that could make consumers more cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't comment at this particular stage on what particular
actions will or will not be taken,'' Greenspan said when asked
about the possibility of a rate cut on Tuesday. ``But I really
would suggest to you that I think we know where we have to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has not cut interest rates since January
1996, when it reduced its short-term federal funds target rate to
5.25 percent from 5.5 percent. The only move it has made since then
is a quarter point increase back to 5.5 percent in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said the central bank might still take only a half
step when it meets next Tuesday and adopt a formal ``bias'' toward
an ease in policy, a signal that it expects its next move to be a
rate cut.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a growing feeling among analysts that Greenspan
will make a strong case at the meeting for an immediate cut of a
quarter point and try to persuade the committee's more
inflation-wary members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means the odds now strongly favor him cutting rates on
Sept. 29,'' said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey Lanston &AMP;
Co. in New York. Economists said Greenspan previewed the argument
he is likely to make to the central bank's Federal Open Market
Committee in saying Wednesday that ``deteriorating foreign
economies and their spillover to domestic markets have increased
the possibility that the slowdown in the growth of the American
economy will be more than sufficient to hold inflation in check.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has couched his increasingly explicit discussions of
the rationale for a rate cut in terms of protecting the domestic
economic expansion, which began in 1991 and has seen inflation
almost wiped out even as unemployment has fallen to its lowest
level in more than 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   But with much of Asia in recession, Russia in economic turmoil
and Latin America increasingly at risk, industrialized and
developing nations alike have been calling for a rate reduction in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A rate cut by the Fed could help the rest of the world by
stimulating more growth in the United States, a major market for
the goods and services produced in many struggling economies.
</P>
<P>
   It could also weaken the value of the dollar relative to other
currencies. That could help ease some of the financial pressure
felt by governments, banks and companies around the world that are
struggling with falling currency values and debts denominated in
dollars. And it could provide a psychological boost to financial
markets, which have been looking to Greenspan for signs of
leadership at a time when governments and international
institutions have provided few answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way of saying we're going to do our part to sustain
growth in our own economy at a time when the world is fragile,''
said Robert DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Smith Barney in New
York. ``Cutting rates in America doesn't solve the banking and debt
restructuring problems of these troubled places, but you start to
form a base for rebuilding confidence in the global economy and
then hope everybody does their part.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan first raised the possibility of a rate cut in a speech
in California early this month, saying the United States could not
expect to remain an ``island of prosperity'' at a time when much of
the rest of world was struggling. Last week he said there was no
prospect of a coordinated rate cut by the world's biggest
industrial countries _ Germany's powerful Bundesbank had already
signaled that it would not go along _ but again hinted that slowing
growth in the United States might justify a policy easing by the
Fed.
</P>
<P>
   His wording Wednesday, however, was far more forceful than in
his previous statements about the risks facing the world and
American economies and his signal of an eventual rate cut
considerably less veiled.
</P>
<P>
   There are few signs that the crisis that began last year in Asia
is subsiding, he said, describing the last several months as ``the
most recent more virulent phase of the crisis.'' The problems in
the rest of the world have ``also been accompanied by a rising
concern for risk in the United States,'' he said, adding that the
``restraining effects of recent development on the U.S. economy are
likely to intensify.''
</P>
<P>
   Through much of this year, Greenspan held off pressure from a
number of Fed policy-makers for an interest-rate increase to head
off inflationary pressures. Two of the committee's 12 members _
Jerry Jordan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland,
and William Poole, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St.
Louis _ voted last spring for an interest-rate increase, and a
number of others were leaning in that direction.

ZANARDI WON'T HAVE TO EXAGGERATE ABOUT HIS CART CAREER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The man has begun packing for a return to Formula One with 14
career CART victories, or 53 fewer than the legendary A.J. Foyt.
</P>
<P>
   He has racked up 1,034 career laps led, or 39 fewer than
one-time Top Fuel drag racer Danny ``On the Gas'' Ongais.
</P>
<P>
   His eight poles to date position him in a tie for 26th on the
all-time list, two behind that self-described ``thoroughbred
Englishman'' _ Nigel Mansell.
</P>
<P>
   These are the numbers that have earned Alex Zanardi a three-year
contract, worth a reported $6.7 million per season, from F1 team
owner Frank Williams beginning in 1999. And if they don't exactly
floor you, keep in mind that for the better part of three seasons
Zanardi has been the barometer for every Gil, Dario and Mauricio
competing in the Championship Auto Racing Teams FedEx Series.
</P>
<P>
   They are going to absolutely adore this Italian in Formula One,
where his slashing, instinctive driving style and rapier wit figure
to be a perfect fit for the biggest budgets and egos in
motorsports. For the same reasons, they are going to miss Zanardi's
fiery presence in CART once he concludes his series stay with the
three races remaining on the 1998 schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The first of those is the inaugural Texaco Grand Prix of Houston
on Oct. 4, when 1.68 miles of downtown streets will be transformed
into a concrete canyon suitable for Zanardi-style slashing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting when we go to a new course,'' said Zanardi,
the newly crowned two-time CART FedEx champion whose move to
Williams was confirmed Tuesday. ``It adds a lot of desire.
Everybody will start from scratch and we've always been really good
to learn new situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Zanardi, 31, wrapped up his second CART title for Target/Chip
Ganassi Racing with a fourth-place finish in the street race at
Vancouver on Sept. 6. With four races remaining, it was the
earliest anyone had clinched in CART history and the first
back-to-back championships since Bobby Rahal's crowns in 1986-87.
</P>
<P>
   Zanardi's six victories this season are a series high, with
three additional shots remaining. His 14 career victories certainly
pale in comparison to Foyt's all-time total, but consider that
Zanardi has scored his in only 48 starts. His 12 podiums _ first,
second or third-place finishes this season _ is another record.
</P>
<P>
   These are the reasons Williams began his pursuit of Zanardi, who
will be teamed with Ralf Schumacher _ younger brother of two-time
F1 World Driving Champion Michael Schumacher _ next year.
</P>
<P>
   Zanardi is scheduled to test for Williams in Barcelona, Spain,
before fulfilling his commitment to CART team owner Chip Ganassi.
It figures to be an emotional period for Zanardi, who was an
unknown commodity when Ganassi signed him as Jimmy Vasser's
teammate beginning in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chip is a very ambitious person,'' said Zanardi, recalling
their first meeting at Laguna Seca Raceway in the fall of 1995.
``He decided to hire a new driver that had not the experience but
the possibility to bring some fresh ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Vasser won the first of Target/Chip Ganassi's three consecutive
titles in 1996, but Zanardi has outdriven the American the last two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy is a wonderful person,'' Zanardi said of Vasser, the
points runner-up who ended speculation about his future by signing
a three-year contract extension with Ganassi. ``Jimmy gave me
everything he had to stop me from winning the championship, but I
would have been surprised if he had done something different. There
was a nice battle inside the team. But we never stopped sharing the
technical information. Actually, this is the only side of our
business you can call sport.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of it merely is a multimillion-dollar grind. And for
Zanardi, the grinding business of motorsport will return him to
Europe with wonderful memories of his stay in the USA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those three years I just spent with Target/Chip Ganassi Racing
was incredible,'' said Zanardi, who along with his wife, Daniela,
recently celebrated the birth of their first child. ``So many
beautiful things happening one day after another ... there is very
little to regret. I collected the best satisfaction of my racing
career and achieved results I didn't even think possible in my
dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day when I am old and with my son sitting in front of the
fireplace, I'll have things to tell him _ without exaggerating.'' &QL;

<P>
   Mark Martin's 194-point deficit to Winston Cup championship
leader Jeff Gordon figures out to a little more than a one-race
margin _ 175 points for a victory plus all 10 available bonus
points _ under NASCAR's scoring system. But consider this: Both
Gordon and Martin have posted 21 top-10 finishes this season.
Gordon, who has a series-leading 10 victories to Martin's
career-high six, needs to finish fourth or better in the remaining
seven races to claim his third championship and second in a row.
Then consider this: Gordon never has won a race in October or
November during his Cup career. And his best finishing average in
any of the remaining races is 7.6, in the rescheduled Pepsi 400 at
Daytona International Speedway on Oct. 17. ...

   Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s blockbuster Winston Cup sponsorship deal
with Anheuser-Busch Inc. will go beyond sporting Budweiser's colors
on Chevrolet Monte Carlos owned by his famous daddy. The program
begins with a five-race Cup preview in 1999. As part of the deal,
Earnhardt Jr. will be featured in an extensive line of
point-of-sale materials and licensed merchandise. Little Earnhardt,
the current Busch Grand National Series points leader who will move
to Winston Cup full time in 2000, will also appear in a variety of
advertising and promotional campaigns for Budweiser and the brand's
status as the Official Beer of NASCAR through 2004. ``Never in my
wildest dreams did I imagine that I would be in a Winston Cup car
so soon,'' said Earnhardt Jr., 23, whose 1999 Cup schedule and car
number have yet to be announced. ``That's a good motivator for me
to go out and do the best I can. I want to show everyone they've
made a good investment.'' The Associated Press reported the total
value of the package at more than $10 million per year. Meanwhile,
Anheuser-Busch plans to honor its current Cup contract with
Hendrick Motorsports, which expires at the end of next season. ...

   Jeremy Mayfield's third-place finish in the MBNA Gold 400 at

<P>
   Release of the Pep Boys Indy Racing League's 1999 schedule is
being complicated by the decision not to return to the New
Hampshire International Speedway at Loudon, N.H. IRL officials are
having trouble finding another suitable oval track with an open
date that fits into the mix, meaning the 1999 tour could shrink by
one race _ from 11 to 10. An IRL source also confirmed that
officials are considering moving the 1999 season finale from Las
Vegas Motor Speedway to Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth, where
81,000 fans turned out on a hot afternoon for the Lone Star 500K on
Sunday. The attendance exceeded the pre-race expectations of TMS
general manager Eddie Gossage, and gave management here a two-race
average of 90,500 IRL fans this season. ...

   Plano's Greg Ray is not the only driver wondering if he has a
future with Team Menard. Team manager Larry Curry said Ray is on
the short list of candidates to replace reigning series champion
Tony Stewart, who is headed for a full-time Winston Cup ride with
Joe Gibbs Racing. Robbie Buhl, Menard's current No. 2, also is
unsure about ``the format'' team owner John Menard will employ next
year. ``What my role is going to be, I don't know. It's definitely
a place I would like to continue to race,'' Buhl said. ``It's up to
John.'' Curry said he expects a decision before the season-ending

   Jac Haudenschild recorded his 10th victory of the season Sept.
19 in one of the Pennzoil World of Outlaws Series most prestigious
races _ the Gold Cup Race of Champions in Chico, Calif.
Haudenschild, of Wooster, Ohio, took the lead on the eighth lap of
the 40-lap event at the quarter-mile Silver Dollar Speedway and led
the rest of the way. He earned $20,000, finishing well ahead of
local favorite Brent Kaeding. Steve Kinser ran fourth and extended
his lead in the points chase to 48 over reigning champion Sammy
Swindell, who struggled to a 10th-place result. The series
continues this weekend at I-80 Speedway in Greenwood, Neb., with
tomorrow's event scheduled to be televised live by TNN at 7 p.m. &QL;

STILL IN THE FAMILY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The half-mile Martinsville (Va.) Speedway is the last remaining
charter member track operating in the Winston Cup Series during
NASCAR's 50th anniversary season.
</P>
<P>
   As such, Martinsville often tops the list of tracks that might _
or should _ lose a Cup date in favor of new facilities like Texas
Motor Speedway in Fort Worth. But Clay Campbell, president of
Martinsville Speedway since 1988 and grandson of founder Clay
Earles, says NASCAR has not mentioned the possibility of losing a
date to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just talk,'' Campbell said. ``NASCAR has never said
anything, other than keep up and you'll be part of the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinsville's management, which will play host to a combined
Busch/Cup weekend beginning tomorrow, has added 13 corporate suites
down the front straight and a new pedestrian bridge in a bid to
keep up for 1998-99. Campbell said management systematically has
added from 2,500 to 4,000 seats per year since 1988 to boost its
current seating capacity to 81,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a three-year or five-year plan, but I'd say
100,000 (seats) shortly after 2000 would probably be close to
maxing it out,'' Campbell said. ``The next addition we do will be
between turns 1 and 2 and give us 15,000 to 18,000 more seats. We
have the blueprints (drawn) now. The interest is there. We do what
we have to do to keep putting them up.'' &QL; 
NUTS AND BOLTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All 40,000 reserved seats for CART's inaugural Texaco Grand Prix
of Houston street race Oct. 2-4 are sold out. General admission
tickets remain for all three days, but race-day GA tickets are
available only by advance purchase. To purchase tickets call (713)
739-7223 or (713) 739-7272.

   Seven-time champion Dale Earnhardt made his 600th career Winston
Cup start in the MBNA Gold 400 in Dover, Del.

   IRL points-leader Kenny Brack failed to lead a lap during the
Lone Star 500K at TMS. But Brack became the second driver to
surpass $1 million in league earnings this season at $1,054,500. &QL; 
LAST WORDS &QL;

Nobody has ever done that and probably never will.''

   ``When Did We Lose Harriet?''
</P>
<P>
   By Patricia Sprinkle
</P>
<P>
   Zondervan, $9.99
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, God, for nosy old women.'' When she utters that
prayer, librarian Josheba Davidson isn't thinking of the
protagonist of ``When Did We Lose Harriet?,'' but she might just as
well have been.
</P>
<P>
   When MacLaren Yarbrough of Georgia takes a midsummer flight to
Montgomery, Ala., she has nothing more in mind than seeing her
hospitalized younger brother. But a chance (or is it really
chance?) visit to a teen center sets her on a hunt for a vanished
15-year-old that leads into lethal territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Did We Lose Harriet?'' _ the beginning of a new series
for mystery writer Patricia Sprinkle _ is narrated alternately by
MacLaren and Josheba, and touches on the New Testament parable of
the lost sheep. The spiritual aspects of Sprinkle's tale are
present but far from preachy, much like her main character.
</P>
<P>
   MacLaren is strong-minded and inquisitive and makes for an
affable heroine. Mystery fans with a taste for the South and gray
hair may find ``When Did We Lose Harriet?'' to be their cup of iced
tea.

<P>
   ``Supernatural''
</P>
<P>
   dc Talk
</P>
<P>
   Forefront Records
</P>
<P>
   FIRST: dc Talk did not become a pop group, and did not go
secular.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the rumors floating around in anticipation of
``Supernatural,'' their first album since 1995's platinum-selling,
multiple-award-winning ``Jesus Freak.''
</P>
<P>
   The pop rumor apparently started because of ``My Will,'' their
contribution to the Exodus project. Yes, that was a pop song. And
yes, there are pop songs on ``Supernatural,'' including a beautiful
love song called ``Godsend.''
</P>
<P>
   But fear not. The boys _ Toby McKeehan, Michael Tait and Kevin
Max _ still know how to rock. Songs like ``Fearless, It's Killing
Me'' and the title track groove as well as anything on ``Jesus
Freak.''
</P>
<P>
   As for that secular thing: Yes, this album _ which is due in
stores Tuesday _ releases simultaneously on Virgin Records, a
mainstream label. But that's in keeping with their mission to take
the Gospels to the world.
</P>
<P>
   In no way did they water down the message in hopes of secular
success. Their motto always has been ``if dc Talk crosses over,
we're taking the cross with us,'' and they stay true to that. Songs
like ``Into Jesus, Red Letters, Consume Me'' and ``The Truth''
leave no doubt as to where they stand on issues of faith.
</P>
<P>
   OK, with the rumors out of the way, let's get down to the bottom
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Supernatural'' is a worthy follow-up to ``Jesus Freak.'' It
reveals a group growing musically and spiritually.
</P>
<P>
   It is an outstanding album. If it's not their best yet, it's at
least tied for first.

entertainment/arts articles this week for release Sunday, Sept. 27,
1998. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (Moved in `e' category)
</P>
<P>
   FEATURE Stories
</P>
<P>
   PLACIDO-DOMINGO-MUSIC (Undated) _ As weeks go in the life of the
ubiquitous Placido Domingo, the next two, though cram-packed by the
standards of mere mortal performers, are not that punishing. Monday
night the 57-year-old tenor will celebrate the 30th anniversary, to
the day, of his Metropolitan Opera debut by singing Samson to the
Dalila of the mezzo-soprano Olga Borodina in the production of
Saint-Saens' opera introduced last season. It will be televised
almost live (with a one-hour taped delay), starting at 8 p.m. on
PBS. By Anthony Tommasini. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FILM AND VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   WRITERS-FILMS (Undated) _ James Ivory, the director of the new
film ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries,'' based on Kaylie Jones'
novel about her father the novelist James Jones, boasts about the
fact that in the many movies he has made about authors, he has
almost never shown one writing. ``I never even for one second
thought of him writing,'' said Ivory of his latest character. The
image of the miserable outsider, an alcoholic tormented by writer's
block, facing a forbidding black Remington portable in a seedy
hotel room, is a commonplace of films about writers, and Ivory has
always strived to avoid it. The difficulty in portraying a writer's
life is that ``There is nothing to be seen,'' said Ivory. The
typical writer's activities are limited, at best. In fact, there is
a long tradition of movies about writers, and they present
directors with a number of unique kinds of technical and artistic
challenges _ not the least of which is how do you depict what is
essentially an interior, solitary, intellectual process in a visual
medium like film? By Dinitia Smith. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   HIT-ME-FILM (Undated) _ I 'M basically drawn to defeated,
injured, hurt, barely walking characters,'' said Steven Shainberg,
the director of ``Hit Me.'' Little wonder, then, that he would
choose a bleak, gritty Jim Thompson novel, ``A Swell-Looking
Babe,'' for his first feature film. By Annette Insdorf. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   THEATER
</P>
<P>
   CIVIL-WAR-MUSICAL (Houston) _ T HE first sing-through of ``The
Civil War,'' the musical extravaganza that opened to enthusiastic
audiences and positive, if qualified, reviews at the Alley Theater
here on Sept. 16, took place in the Alley's only rehearsal space, a
windowless room beneath the stage. It is a space more suitable for
a chamber group than for the 28 singers and 9 musicians who crammed
it that day in late August, belting out the sentimental ballads and
calculated, 11-o'clock show stoppers that are the specialty of the
composer, Frank Wildhorn. By Bruce Weber. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   DANCE
</P>
<P>
   MAGUY-MARIN-DANCE (Lyons, France) _ Ms. Maguy Marin has moved
her modern-dance troupe, the Compagnie Maguy Marin, from the
Parisian suburb of Creteil to Rillieux-La-Pape, a tougher immigrant
suburb of Lyons. She has also stopped doing commissioned works for
major ballet companies and is concentrating on her own company,
which will present her 1995 ``Ramdam'' at the Joyce Theater from
Tuesday through Oct. 11. Nonetheless, it was the Lyons Opera Ballet
that presented some of the highly elaborate productions for which
she is best-known: ``Cendrillon,'' a doll-house version of
``Cinderella,'' seen in New York in 1987 and ``Coppelia,'' in a
modern-dress, mixed-media staging performed at Lincoln Center
Festival '96. By Anna Kisselgoff. (Moved). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   GEWANDHAUS-ORCHESTRA (Leipzig, Germany) _ Music has contributed
to Leipzig's internationalism: less because of the city's past
association with Bach, Mendelssohn and other luminaries than
because of the Gewandhaus Orchestra itself. The conductor Kurt
Masur has elevated the two-century-old orchestra from postwar
mediocrity into an internationally viable, and internationally
active, body that tours several months a year around the globe, and
is arguably East Germany's most prominent orchestra. By Anne
Midgette. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ART
</P>
<P>
   PHOTOGRAPHY-ROOTS (Undated) _ On the verge of a filmless,
digital revolution, photography is moving forward into its past.
Photographers are polishing daguerreotype plates, coating paper
with egg whites, transforming entire trailers into pinhole cameras
and mixing emulsions from 19th-century recipes in order to coax new
expressive effects from old photographic techniques. By Lyle Rexer.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN-SITCOMS-TV (Undated) _ By all accounts, the women on
television (at least in sitcoms) are increasingly at odds with the
women in the audience, but who's to blame? Advertisers chasing a
demographic? Networks too frightened to take chances? Writers
without talent? Pressure from sydicators who know that shows about
women don't do as well in reruns? It depends on whom you talk to.
In the lightning-fast world of television development, everyone
passes the buck. But one thing is clear: in a season viewed as one
of the most moribund in memory, the rhetoric is heated almost to
the boil. By Nancy Hass. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FELICITY-TV (Undated) _ Focus groups swooned over the pilot of
the WB's ``Felicity.'' Industry analysts _ even executives at rival
networks _ declared ``Felicity,'' a new hourlong drama, the only
sure hit of an otherwise unpredictable fall season. Spotting their
latest It Girl, magazine and newspaper editors rushed to give the
kiss-and-hug treatment to the show's star, Keri Russell, 22, a
former Mouseketeer with an innocently open gaze and angelically
backlit blond curls who seems incapable of taking a bad photograph.
``Felicity'' is the tale of an intelligent, introspective and
usually obedient rich girl who rejects her parent's plans to send
her to Stanford University and medical school so that she can
follow a tousled-haired hunk she hardly knows to a college in New
York City. By Margy Rochlin. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES
</P>
<P>
   GLASS-FUSION-ANTIQUES (New York) _ Toots Zynsky produces fantasy
forms in glass that look as fragile and festive as crepe-paper
objects _ ruffled, puckered, pinched and drenched with color. She
uses a revolutionary technique to create the multicolored tuliplike
works: instead of blowing or casting these pieces, she fuses
thousands of glass threads into entire vessels. She began exploring
this technique in 1982, when she lived in Manhattan. Ms. Zynsky
(born Maryann but called Toots since infancy), 47, is back in New
York for her second solo exhibition here, ``Toots Zynsky: Chaotic
Fusion,'' at the Barry Friedman gallery on 67th Street, through
Oct. 24. By Rita Reif. (Moved).

<P>
   PHOENIX - At approximately 11:30 a.m. Wednesday, I decided to
drive to Pittsburgh, Pa., for lunch. I usually don't go out to eat
that early, but I needed to get back to the office by
mid-afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, I was really hungry.
</P>
<P>
   I'd been day-dreaming all morning about French fries with gravy,
the way the diners offered them in western Pennsylvania. And about
stuffed cabbage and pierogies, which we'd get at the Polish church
on weekends, prepared by women from the old country who prayed the
Rosary as they worked. And about ``wedding'' soup, which was
available even on days when no one got married. And about
hamburgers served with the fries and cole slaw (begin ital) inside
(end ital) the bun, the way the Good Lord meant it to be.
</P>
<P>
   There are times when a person needs to feed his face, and times
when he needs to feed his soul.
</P>
<P>
   And there are days _ like Wednesday _ when he needs both.
</P>
<P>
   So I headed ``back East'' on the Route 202 until it ended in
Mesa, then kept heading east on McKellips to Gilbert Road, and
turned south.
</P>
<P>
   Just past the intersection with Broadway there's a small strip
mall. It's put together like a hoagie with the works, long and thin
and stuffed full of things you don't need but occasionally want.
</P>
<P>
   Squeezed between a convenience store and a check-cashing
operation is a little restaurant called ``A `Burg` Thing.''
</P>
<P>
   It's owned and operated by Rick and Wendy Zitalone, who've lived
in Arizona for about five years. Rick grew up in Butler, a little
town north Pittsburgh. He played high school football when a team
down the road in Beaver Falls had a hot shot quarterback named
Namath.
</P>
<P>
   ``What an arm,'' Rick says. ``I saw it first hand.''
</P>
<P>
   I tell him I saw Mike Ditka play when I was a kid, and was part
of a Pop Warner team that was taken apart by a young Tony Dorsett.
</P>
<P>
   This was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Zitalone isn't just a guy who runs a restaurant. Or a quy who
knows football. He's a guy who can properly pronounce the name of
the Pittsburgh (begin ital) Stillers. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   No matter where you were born, you need people like this in your
life.
</P>
<P>
   There is home, and there is ``back home.''
</P>
<P>
   One is where you are, the other is where you are from.
</P>
<P>
   The best part of living in Phoenix is that we get to have it
both ways. Wherever you're from, there's someone here from there.
There's some bar, some restaurant, some social club, some
organization with connections to where you were born.
</P>
<P>
   For me, there are people like the Zitalones. People who
understand you want a bologna sandwich when you ask for ``jumbo;''
that you're thirsty for a soda when you ask for a ``pop.''
</P>
<P>
   They not only know what a ``terrible towel''is used for, but
know who invented it. (The great sportscaster Myron Cope.)
</P>
<P>
   For more than 20 years Rick was a firefighter in Butler. Wendy
was a city manager back there, and has worked as a financial
analyst in the Valley. Like most people who move across country to
Arizona, the couple didn't only pack up their memories, but their
dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to open a place like this,'' Rick says. ``We kept
talking about it, waiting for the right moment, and it never came.
So, we just did it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a small place with pictures and posters and team pennants
on the walls, and TV set the size of a mini-van near the front
door. Steeler fans reserve space in front of the big screen every
Sunday to watch the games. The Zitalones set up a buffet and charge
$10 a person.
</P>
<P>
   They keep a guest book in the shop, now, which is filling with
the signatures of people living here and remembering there.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it is for us in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   We get to go out on days when we feel like it, or need it, and
visit the old stamping grounds, maybe linger over the some fries
and gravy, take in the sights, talk. And still be home by supper
time. &QL;

   SALMON-ATLANTIC (Undated) Provincial and federal governments now
have proof that Atlantic salmon introduced for fish farming are
reproducing in the wild, which could devastate wild salmon runs.
Many biologists and the fish farming companies have said the fish
can't reproduce in the wild, and hence pose little threat to wild
stocks. If this is proof that they can, it could signal a death
knell to native stocks, as the farm-raised fish could spread
disease, destroy wild salmon nesting areas, even eat baby wild
salmon. Unlike the native fish, the farmed variety don't die after
spawning. The salmon were found mid-August in the Tsitika River on
Vancouver Island. Four of 12 juveniles seen, representing two-year
classes, were captured and examined by provincial biologists. In a
report to the fisheries minister, the find is called ``the first
verified report of successful reproduction for introduced Atlantic
salmon, anywhere in the world.''

   FBC-HUSKIES (Seattle) He was ``Brock's Boy.'' He was allowed to
come into the University of Washington football program because he
knew the quarterback, was his primary receiver in high school. He
was Brock Huard's caddy. Or so some of the Huskies suspected. ``I'm
not sure people actually believed I wasn't Brock's Boy until after
that first game,'' Dane Looker says. ``I came to the sidelines, and
I started to get different looks from guys.'' He caught a
UW-record-tying 11 passes. The legend of Dane Looker grows. He
figures to be a key to any UW upset hopes when the Huskies travel
to No. 2 Nebraska Saturday.

   There are times when a person needs to feed his face, and times
when he needs to feed his soul.
</P>
<P>
   And there are days _ like Wednesday _ when he needs both.
</P>
<P>
   So I headed ``back East'' on the Route 202 until it ended in
Mesa, then kept heading east on McKellips to Gilbert Road, and
turned south.
</P>
<P>
   Just past the intersection with Broadway there's a small strip
mall. It's put together like a hoagie with the works, long and thin
and stuffed full of things you don't need but occasionally want.
</P>
<P>
   Squeezed between a convenience store and a check-cashing
operation is a little restaurant called ``A `Burg` Thing.''
</P>
<P>
   It's owned and operated by Rick and Wendy Zitalone, who've lived
in Arizona for about five years. Rick grew up in Butler, a little
town north Pittsburgh. He played high school football when a team
down the road in Beaver Falls had a hot shot quarterback named
Namath.
</P>
<P>
   ``What an arm,'' Rick says. ``I saw it first hand.''
</P>
<P>
   I tell him I saw Mike Ditka play when I was a kid, and was part
of a Pop Warner team that was taken apart by a young Tony Dorsett.
</P>
<P>
   This was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Zitalone isn't just a guy who runs a restaurant. Or a quy who
knows football. He's a guy who can properly pronounce the name of
the Pittsburgh (begin ital) Stillers. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   No matter where you were born, you need people like this in your
life.
</P>
<P>
   There is home, and there is ``back home.''
</P>
<P>
   One is where you are, the other is where you are from.
</P>
<P>
   The best part of living in Phoenix is that we get to have it
both ways. Wherever you're from, there's someone here from there.
There's some bar, some restaurant, some social club, some
organization with connections to where you were born.
</P>
<P>
   For me, there are people like the Zitalones. People who
understand you want a bologna sandwich when you ask for ``jumbo;''
that you're thirsty for a soda when you ask for a ``pop.''
</P>
<P>
   They not only know what a ``terrible towel''is used for, but
know who invented it. (The great sportscaster Myron Cope.)
</P>
<P>
   For more than 20 years Rick was a firefighter in Butler. Wendy
was a city manager back there, and has worked as a financial
analyst in the Valley. Like most people who move across country to
Arizona, the couple didn't only pack up their memories, but their
dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to open a place like this,'' Rick says. ``We kept
talking about it, waiting for the right moment, and it never came.
So, we just did it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a small place with pictures and posters and team pennants
on the walls, and TV set the size of a mini-van near the front
door. Steeler fans reserve space in front of the big screen every
Sunday to watch the games. The Zitalones set up a buffet and charge
$10 a person.
</P>
<P>
   They keep a guest book in the shop, now, which is filling with
the signatures of people living here and remembering there.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it is for us in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   We get to go out on days when we feel like it, or need it, and
visit the old stamping grounds, maybe linger over the some fries
and gravy, take in the sights, talk. And still be home by supper
time. &QL;

 By ADAM NAGOURNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With Rep. Charles Schumer at her side, Hillary Rodham
Clinton started a three-day national campaign tour on Wednesday by
characterizing Sen. Alfonse D'Amato as a ``Jesse Helms clone'' who
had repeatedly voted to keep women ``down and back'' during his 18
years in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing at once spirited and sober, the first lady glided from
a luncheon fund-raiser at a nightclub in midtown Manhattan to a
basement shelter for battered women on Manhattan's Lower East Side,
using every venue to assail D'Amato and talk up the credentials of
his opponent in the New York Senate race, Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton described Schumer, D-Brooklyn, as one of President
Clinton's most steadfast supporters in Congress, crediting him with
supporting legislation to curb crime and benefit women. By
contrast, Mrs. Clinton referred to D'Amato, who once spearheaded
congressional investigations into the Clintons' Whitewater land
dealings, only as ``Chuck's opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fair to say that Chuck's opponent has voted in a
way that puts him in the same category as those in the Senate who
are consistently voting to keep women down and back,'' Mrs. Clinton
said at the $1,000-a-head fund-raiser for Schumer's campaign, where
she criticized D'Amato's stance on abortion. ``His voting record on
choice is the same as Jesse Helms.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``The people of New York need to know that you do not
need a Jesse Helms clone in the United States Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip to New York by Mrs. Clinton signaled a new public role
for the first lady in the fall congressional races: she will
campaign in five states over three days, part of what her press
secretary, Marsha Berry, described as ``her fall initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   The eagerness with which Schumer embraced her on Wednesday _ in
contrast to the reluctance many Democrats have showed to appearing
with her husband since he acknowledged an affair with a White House
intern _ left little doubt that the first lady would fill the
election season role that in normal times would have been assumed
by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Although the president is also campaigning on behalf of
congressional candidates through the weekend, most of his
appearances are closed to cameras, often by the choice of the local
candidates themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, D'Amato countered Mrs. Clinton by sharing a dais
with Clinton and President Nelson Mandela at a ceremony in the
congressional rotunda honoring the South African leader. D'Amato
won his spot after Sen. Trent Lott, the Republican leader, yielded
the high-profile seat to D'Amato, an unstated political boost to a
senator who many Republicans feel is facing tough going in his bid
for a fourth term.

 &HT;    Mandela receives rare honor in ceremony thick with irony
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington -- Under the historic arching rotunda of the U.S.
Capitol, President Clinton awarded South African President Nelson
Mandela the Congressional Gold Medal Wednesday as the lawmakers
holding the fate of Clinton's presidency in their hands watched
just a few feet away.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting one person away from Clinton was House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, (R-Ga.), who only minutes before the ceremony began had
urged Democratic leaders to take the next step toward impeaching
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The irony may have not been lost on Clinton, who praised the
80-year-old Mandela for his lack of bitterness toward his enemies,
especially the former South African government, which had
imprisoned him for 27 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In forgiving those who imprisoned him, he reminded us of the
most fundamental lesson of all: that in the end, apartheid was a
defeat of the heart, the mind, the spirit,'' Clinton told the
audience of dignitaries and lawmakers. ``It was not just a
structure outside, in jailhouses, within which people were kept. It
was a division of the mind and soul against itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandela, who became president of South Africa soon after the
apartheid government crumbled, joins the ranks of Abraham Lincoln,
Winston Churchill and Mother Theresa in becoming the 100th person
to earn the prestigious award since it was first given to George
Washington in 1776.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton slipped the medal around Mandela's neck, the South
African leader reached out to Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), a
one-time segregationist, and raised his arm in the air. Saying his
life sometimes made him feel ``like the heavyweight boxing champion
of the world,'' Mandela called for a partnership between the United
States and South Africa to help his country overcome economic
hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The breadth of our relationship makes the United States an
indispensable partner in bringing material improvements in the
lives of our people, especially the poor, without which our
democracy would remain a hollow shell and our stability fragile,''
Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
   With misty eyes, Gingrich also seized on Mandela's life as an
example to follow, underscoring his sacrifice and humility during
his imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are privileged today to be in the presence of the father of
multiracial democracy in Africa and the leading example in the
world today of the spirit of (George) Washington and (Martin
Luther) King,'' Gingrich said. ``Politics in a free society is a
very rough-and-tumble business, involving, at times, great personal
pain. ... President Mandela, you give every person on the planet a
personal witness to how valuable freedom must be to be worthy of
such a life.''
</P>
<P>
   While there was no direct mention at the ceremony of the
president's troubles over his relationship with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky, Mandela did address it the evening before
at a reception in honor of African-American religious leaders,
presidents of black colleges and members of the Congressional Black
Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our morality does not allow us to desert our friends,''
Mandela told the president and first lady at the reception attended
by African-American religious leaders, including the daughter of
Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Bernice King also addressed the reception, saying that
it was ``time to leave our president alone,'' at which point the
crowd applauded loudly and began chanting, ``Leave him alone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And so, Mr. President, because we have all sinned,
everybody,'' said King, in an impassioned speech where she made
several comparisons between her father and Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody, from the highest to the lowest, from the news media
to Capitol Hill, we have all sinned,'' King said. ``From pulpits to
the pews, we have all sinned and fallen short of God's glory. And
so I, and I believe there are many others in this room, who forgive
you, it is time, I think, for us to leave our president alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Following King's remarks, the president called his friendship
with Mandela, one of the greatest of the ``many blessings for
Hillary and me far outweighing all of the trials.''
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's speech, Clinton said Mandela had taught him an
important lesson: ``That even more important than the sacrifice
yesterday is what you are doing with today and what you will do
with tomorrow, for that is the thing that always humbles me when I
am with Nelson Mandela, the sense of serenity and pace and
engagement in the moment.''

 &HT;    Famine in southern Sudan reaches catastrophic proportions
 &HT;    Eds: A longer version of this story moved Tuesday. Photos are

 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAHR EL GHAZALM, Sudan _ Abuk bol's father starved to death.
then her mother died.
</P>
<P>
   Abuk was left with her grandmother, Aweng, and nothing to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Then a rumor reached their village that relief agencies were
distributing food in the village of Ajiep, several days' walk away.
So the old woman slung the child on her hip and set out along the
narrow footpaths that crisscross the flat grasslands of southern
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   They ate leaves and grass to stay alive. They slept in the open,
nothing to shield them from the rains and the cool night air.
</P>
<P>
   After days of walking, grandmother and child reached Ajiep, a
once-small village now swollen to an encampment of tens of
thousands. There is food here _ grain to be mixed with water and
cooked into a gruel.
</P>
<P>
   Only now, Abuk is in terrible shape.
</P>
<P>
   Her ribs protrude. Her shoulder blades stick out like little
wings. Her head seems too large for her body.
</P>
<P>
   From her size, you might guess her age at eight months, but Abuk
is 4 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Without the food, Aweng says, ``We would die, all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   A human catastrophe is unfolding in southern Sudan, a land
haunted by famine.
</P>
<P>
   Three million people _ nearly 10 percent of the country's
population _ will need some level of food assistance to make it
through the coming year, say United Nations officials in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The famine has hit hardest in the province of Bahr el Ghazal in
the southwestern part of Sudan, where 770,000 people are threatened
with death by starvation. To try to avert a catastrophe even larger
than what hit the region in the late 1980s, a huge international
relief effort must continue at least through October 1999, said Ted
Chaiban, deputy chief of operations for the U.N. relief effort in
southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   The primary cause of all this hunger and misery and death is not
the vagaries of weather or any other caprice of nature.
</P>
<P>
   It is the utter indifference of some human beings toward the
suffering of others.
</P>
<P>
   True, scant rains the past two years have reduced harvests and
left people in southern Sudan poorer and less healthy, but the main
cause of the famine is Sudan's 15-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers on both sides have robbed people of their cattle and
sent them fleeing from their land, unable to plant crops or support
themselves in Bahr el Ghazal province.
</P>
<P>
   At the therapeutic feeding center in Ajiep there, aid workers
treat children who are not merely malnourished but also starving.
</P>
<P>
   This center, run by the Belgian chapter of Doctors Without
Borders, an organization that provides medical care in poor
countries, treats children 5 and younger _ and then only ``when the
problem becomes a pathology,'' says Christine Nadori, a nurse from
Ottawa who works in the feeding center.
</P>
<P>
   But Doctors Without Borders (known internationally as Medecins
San Frontieres) estimates that 55 percent of the thousands of
children in Ajiep are malnourished.
</P>
<P>
   The center admits only children who weigh less than 60 percent
of what they should for their height. That means, for example, that
a child who is 3 feet 11 inches tall _ one who should weigh 48 1/2
pounds _ can get treatment only if he weighs 29 pounds or less.
</P>
<P>
   Each child is dosed with vitamin A, folic acid and antibiotics.
Any child so malnourished has some infection, Nadori says. It may
not be visible, but it's there.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 children are admitted to the therapeutic feeding center
every day, Nadori says. Many have walked four or five days to reach
Ajiep.
</P>
<P>
   A serving of high-energy milk laced with sugar, oil, vitamins
and minerals is provided five times a day. A child is released to
the supplemental feeding program _ in theory, a program designed to
supplement food somehow being obtained elsewhere _ when she reaches
70 percent of her desired weight and maintains it for a week. The
average stay is 21 days.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan, the largest country in Africa, is about the size of the
United States east of the Mississippi River. It stretches from the
Middle East to middle Africa, from Egypt in the north to Congo,
Uganda and Kenya in the south.
</P>
<P>
   The people in the north are mostly Arab and Muslim. The south is
predominantly African and tribal; residents generally adhere to
either Christian or animist beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, the government in Khartoum tried to impose Islamic law.
The south resisted. Civil war has wracked the country since.
</P>
<P>
   Exuberant greetings ring out over the verdant grassland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cibak!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cibak!''
</P>
<P>
   The people in Ajiep are Dinkas, members of a pastoral African
tribe. The word, pronounced ``she-bahk,'' is their greeting, the
Dinka way of asking, ``How are you?''
</P>
<P>
   Ajiep used to be a village of 4,000 or 5,000. Now, 21,000 people
live clustered around the feeding centers and, aid workers say, if
you extend the count to those camped a few hours' walk away, the
number is greater than 50,000.
</P>
<P>
   While some Dinkas plant crops, such as millet and sorghum, many
are cattle herders, almost totally dependent on their cows. With
their cattle, Dinkas are in good shape; when their cattle are
stolen, they are in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   So the condition of people varies dramatically in this newly
created Dinka city, depending largely on whether they have been
preyed upon by the contending armies and on how many days they had
to walk to reach Ajiep.
</P>
<P>
   This year's crops should be harvested in October. But this
year's crops will meet only a fraction of the needs.
</P>
<P>
   Even if all goes well and peace breaks out and next year's rains
come on time, there will be no new harvest until October 1999.
Between now and then, even those Dinkas who still have cattle and
other livestock to trade will find there is no grain.
</P>
<P>
   Except that flown in by relief agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Here and there stand naked children so cadaverous they seem to
have no bottoms, so emaciated their knees are bigger around than
their thighs. One child can walk only with the aid of a stick.
</P>
<P>
   The southern Sudanese people have suffered famine before,
notably in 1988 and '89, when an estimated 250,000 people died. Why
suddenly again in 1998?
</P>
<P>
   Kerubino Bol, a military leader in the Bahr el Ghazal area,
began as a rebel leader but later switched to the government side.
Early this year, unable to strike the deal he wanted with the
government, he switched back and attacked the government-held town
of Wau, 40 miles south of Ajiep, igniting a new round of fighting
and turning tens of thousands of people into refugees just when
they should have been planting crops.
</P>
<P>
   The government made the problem worse by banning flights into
Bahr el Ghazal province. Relief flights could not get through at
the risk of being shot down.
</P>
<P>
   Under international pressure _ in April, British International
Development Secretary Clare Short accused the government of Sudan
of ``deliberately inflicting this starvation on its own people for
its own ends'' _ the government relented.
</P>
<P>
   And in July, both sides agreed to a three-month cease-fire in
Bahr el Ghazal to allow relief planes to fly food in to the
starving.
</P>
<P>
   The truce is set to expire Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The C-130, droning in the distance, bursts through the clouds
over Ajiep. It swoops low, and 16 tons of grain thunders to the
ground, most of it in bags weighing more than 100 pounds each.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, a Russian-built Ilyushin disgorges twice that
much food, and then another Ilyushin flies in, and still another.
</P>
<P>
   It is the largest airlift in the 35-year history of the United
Nations' World Food Program. About 35 relief agencies and other
nongovernmental organizations, working largely out of a base in
northwest Kenya called Lokichokio, are involved.
</P>
<P>
   The airlift, coordinated by Operation Lifeline Sudan, a U.N.
organization created for the purpose, flies more than 11,000 tons
of food a month into 75 sites in south Sudan. Two U.N. agencies _
UNICEF and the World Food Program _ are involved, as are a host of
other agencies, such as Doctors Without Borders, Save the Children
Fund and Oxfam.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that the airlift is saving lives. But relief
workers worry that the aid is doing harm as well.
</P>
<P>
   Feeding stations draw people off their land, leaving them unable
to support themselves. They create what Yohannes Tecle, an Eritrean
who is the United Nations' coordinator in Ajiep, calls ``ghettos.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people congregate where there are no sanitary
facilities. Flies flit from feces to food. Water pools in putrid
puddles. The risk of disease is grave.
</P>
<P>
   Without the aid, though, people would die.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the international community cannot maintain this
level of effort forever. But no end to the war is in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Adeng Manyuot pours water tenderly over the body of her
2-year-old daughter, washing it clean. Nearby a man finishes
digging a small grave.
</P>
<P>
   Adeng covers her daughter with a dingy shroud, climbs into the
shallow grave and gently lays the body down. Then she climbs out
and walks away.
</P>
<P>
   The gravedigger fills in the hole.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the only burial here today. By nightfall, 13 people
will be laid to rest in this field as hunger and disease take their
steady toll.
</P>
<P>
   Awec Mawyen and her family are from Ajiep. But three years ago,
as fighting wracked the area, they moved to Barurud. When the
hunger came this year, she tried to get food in Barurud but was
turned away.
</P>
<P>
   Awec and Amet, from the Luo tribe, walked from Barurud back to
Ajiep as best they could. They were so weak that instead of two
days, it took them five.
</P>
<P>
   When they arrived, they were issued cards by the World Food
Program entitling them to food. But the crowd was too big; they
could not fight their way through.
</P>
<P>
   It rained. No food was distributed.
</P>
<P>
   The following day Amet was dead, leaving Awec to bury him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very bitter about that,'' she says. ``If I see a person
from Barurud and I have the power, I will deny that person food
from here and say, `You go back to Barurud.'''
</P>
<P>
   Night falls, the air cools and rain sweeps across the land. A
woman, walking alone, makes her way into the encampment. Perhaps
her family has died along the way, falling beside the narrow
footpaths as so many others have.
</P>
<P>
   But she perseveres, walking on through the rain, finally
reaching Ajiep.
</P>
<P>
   To cover the famine, writer Don Melvin and photographer Rich
Addicks hopped a decrepit 10-seat Beechcraft Super King Air from
Nairobi for the three-hour flight to the relief staging area at
Lokichokio, in northwest Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   From there, after a night's stay in thatched huts, they rode a
Cessna Caravan, with room for six passengers, for three hours over
war-wracked south Sudan to a muddy landing strip in the middle of
the flat grassland.
</P>
<P>
   They pitched tents under a tree and spent that day, all of the
next and part of a third interviewing and photographing famine
victims and relief workers.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin, 45, is assistant international editor at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution. Addicks, 44, has been involved with
photography at the Journal-Constitution for 16 years.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ With Rep. Charles Schumer at her side, Hillary Rodham
Clinton started a three-day national campaign tour on Wednesday by
characterizing Sen. Alfonse D'Amato as a ``Jesse Helms clone'' who
had repeatedly voted to keep women ``down and back'' during his 18
years in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing at once spirited and sober, the first lady glided from
a luncheon fund-raiser at a nightclub in midtown Manhattan to a
basement shelter for battered women on Manhattan's Lower East Side,
using every venue to assail D'Amato and talk up the credentials of
his opponent in the New York Senate race, Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton described Schumer, D-Brooklyn, as one of President
Clinton's most steadfast supporters in Congress, crediting him with
supporting legislation to curb crime and benefit women. By
contrast, Mrs. Clinton referred to D'Amato, who once spearheaded
congressional investigations into the Clintons' Whitewater land
dealings, only as ``Chuck's opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fair to say that Chuck's opponent has voted in a
way that puts him in the same category as those in the Senate who
are consistently voting to keep women down and back,'' Mrs. Clinton
said at the $1,000-a-head fund-raiser for Schumer's campaign, where
she criticized D'Amato's stance on abortion. ``His voting record on
choice is the same as Jesse Helms.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``The people of New York need to know that you do not
need a Jesse Helms clone in the United States Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip to New York by Mrs. Clinton signaled a new public role
for the first lady in the fall congressional races: she will
campaign in five states over three days, part of what her press
secretary, Marsha Berry, described as ``her fall initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   The eagerness with which Schumer embraced her on Wednesday _ in
contrast to the reluctance many Democrats have showed to appearing
with her husband since he acknowledged an affair with a White House
intern _ left little doubt that the first lady would fill the
election season role that in normal times would have been assumed
by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Although the president is also campaigning on behalf of
congressional candidates through the weekend, most of his
appearances are closed to cameras, often by the choice of the local
candidates themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, D'Amato countered Mrs. Clinton by sharing a dais
with Clinton and President Nelson Mandela at a ceremony in the
congressional rotunda honoring the South African leader. D'Amato
won his spot after Sen. Trent Lott, the Republican leader, yielded
the high-profile seat to D'Amato, an unstated political boost to a
senator who many Republicans feel is facing tough going in his bid
for a fourth term.

 &HT;    Affair between prosecutors, pundits the real scandal
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- We are in trouble when what the French say about us
starts to make sense.
</P>
<P>
   After months of mystification over what's been happening on this
side of the Atlantic, the Paris newspaper Le Monde last week turned
its attention in a special section to the Monica Lewinsky scandal's
possible impact on France.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, several French politicians worried the sex
scandal could be ``the start of an evolution affecting all
democracies because of the distrust that surrounds political
leaders, the latitude permitted to judges, and the pressure of the
media,'' according to an English-language synopsis of the Le Monde
story on the online magazine Slate.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the root of Clinton's destabilization is, above all, a
meshing between the judiciary and the media, and no democracy is
immune from that,'' said Francois Bayrou, president of the
conservative UDK party.
</P>
<P>
   No American analysis of the last nine months has hit the matter
so precisely on the head. Whatever else it has become, the Kenneth
Starr investigation has been, most fundamentally, a project of the
Washington media and the federal bench.
</P>
<P>
   The most fateful step in this long diminution came when a
three-judge panel replaced Robert Fiske _ over the objections of
five past presidents of the American Bar Association _ with Starr,
himself a federal judge. A major criticism of Fiske was that he
wasn't aggressive enough investigating Vincent Foster's death;
Starr's office has long since concurred with Fiske's finding that
it was a suicide.
</P>
<P>
   This overt act of partisanship occurred a couple of years before
Bill met Monica, ultimately the flashpoint around which the media
storm would erupt. But the loop along which information flowed
between Starr's office, the Paula Jones lawyers and those in the
media who were the selected recipients of their leaks, was well
established long before the president decided, in another fateful
moment, to send one of the interns out for pizza.
</P>
<P>
   The grand anticlimax of this unspoken affair between prosecutors
and pundits was probably Monday, when Clinton became the first
American grand jury witness ever to have his testimony broadcast to
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the hype, the Bill Show got big ratings, but don't look
for reruns. This was the most overplayed hand in a long poker game
full of them, and it may at last have cast a media chill on its
relationship with those sources, both Republican and Democrat, who
so misrepresented what was on the videotape.
</P>
<P>
   Or it may be that this marriage, once made, is as indestructible
as Bill and Hillary's.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years from now, American conservatives will look back at
this episode and wonder how, after decades of warning about the
growing activism of the federal judiciary and sensationalizing
impact of the media, their compatriots could have set this
dangerous tandem in motion together for the expedient of destroying
a president who had already caved in to most of their demands. It
is so easy to see that this machinery will not stop grinding when
it runs out of Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the juicy details released Monday was that portion of
Lewinsky's testimony in which she swore she was held for hours in a
hotel room by Starr's prosecutors and the FBI, told she was too old
to call her ``mommy,'' that she'd have to wear a wire before they'd
let her go, that she could go to prison for 27 years and that her
mother might be convicted, too.
</P>
<P>
   That may not be illegal, just as what Clinton did with Lewinsky
may not be sex. But to a true conservative, it ought to be even
more stomach-turning.

 &HT;    Missing the comforts of home
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOJICHOGGIO -- I sat in my thatched hut, watching a mosquito
circle the lone light bulb and trying to motivate myself to take a
shower.
</P>
<P>
   The mosquito, I felt certain, carried malaria. The shower,
unfortunately, was halfway across the camp.
</P>
<P>
   What strange turn of fate, I wondered gloomily, what bizarre
quirk of career had landed me in this dusty outpost so far from
civilization?
</P>
<P>
   More important, was I supposed to walk across the camp wearing
only a towel, or was I supposed to carry a second set of clothes
and carry the dirty ones back under my arm?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I decided on the latter course, since I had only been
in Lokichokio a few hours _ not long enough to feel comfortable
walking around naked. Besides, I didn't want to give the mosquitoes
that broad a target.
</P>
<P>
   On my way, I stopped at the latrines, about 20 of which stood
grouped inside a metal fence. Hand-painted signs on some doors said
``SITTING;'' the other doors were labelled ``SQUATING,'' which I
took to mean ``squatting.''
</P>
<P>
   I chose to sit. It reminded me of the way I did things back
home.
</P>
<P>
   When I reached the showers, I found they had one temperature and
no roof. All in all, I thought as I hopped about, trying to put one
shoe back on without getting the other foot dirty again, this place
is really quite primitive.
</P>
<P>
   I felt as if, rung by rung, I had been descending the ladder of
comfort since leaving Atlanta a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Photographer Rich Addicks and I had started in Atlanta, then
travelled to Nairobi, the capital of Kenya; then on to Lokichokio,
in northwest Kenya. Our destination was southern Sudan; what
conditions there would be like, we still had no idea.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, of course, was air conditioned, clean, with cute little
airport trains that talk to you.
</P>
<P>
   None of those in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   At the airport there, I found myself waiting in hot sweaty lines
while officials in military uniforms filled out endless forms.
</P>
<P>
   If you think carbon paper is a thing of the past, you haven't
been to the Third World lately. Every time you buy a stick of gum,
the clerk inserts two pieces of carbon paper into his pad, pulls
out his ballpoint pen, and laboriously fills out a receipt in
triplicate.
</P>
<P>
   Buying a candy bar just ain't worth the time.
</P>
<P>
   Nairobi is smoggy, crowded, choked with traffic and filled with
drivers who need medication to control their homicidal tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   But the hotel was nice: The place was air conditioned, the food
was edible, the shower ran hot and cold _ and, best of all, it was
right there in my room.
</P>
<P>
   Lokichokio, which used to be a speck on the map _ or even less _
is one of the staging areas for the massive international airlift
that seeks to ease the famine in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   To get to Sudan, we had to get to Lokichokio. To get to
Lokichokio, we had to go not to Jomo Kenyatta Airport, where we had
waited in sweaty lines, but to Wilson Airport, which turned out to
be a low collection of ramshackle offices with no signs directing
you anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to know what kind of plane we'd be flying on, Rich and I
wandered through a hanger and peered outside. Mechanics lay
motionless here and there, sleeping on the tarmac.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually we boarded a twin-engine Beechcraft Super King Air
that looked as if it were of DeSoto vintage. The pilot looked as if
he'd been born in the time of the Model T. There was no co-pilot,
and I tried not to think about what would happen if the old guy
clutched his chest and keeled over in mid-flight.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't, happily for all concerned, and three hours after
taking off we touched down in Lokichokio _ a boomtown built not on
oil wealth but famine relief.
</P>
<P>
   At Loki, as everyone calls it, we stayed in the compound run by
Operation Lifeline Sudan, an arm of the United Nations created to
coordinate the activities of 35 relief agencies operating in
southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   The compound is all dirt roads, dust and tukuls _ the round,
thatch-roofed huts common to the area. Some are used as homes;
others as offices. Few are air conditioned.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the tukuls (pronounced too-kools) have been named for
African places, like Maseru, Mombassa and Kampala. But there is one
named Atlanta; inside I found the Lokichokio branch of the Carter
Center, which works to eradicate guinea worm in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 people lived in this compound earlier this year. Now
that famine has hit Sudan and the international relief effort has
accelerated, the number is more than 350.
</P>
<P>
   Though the area is primitive, there are touches of modern life.
The office tukuls are equipped with computers. There is an outdoor
bar next to the mess hall; through the miracle of satellite
technology, Larry King blares into the night above the clinking of
glasses.
</P>
<P>
   The camp is peopled by an unlikely mix of humanitarians and
ex-military personnel, a strange brew of helpers and loners.
</P>
<P>
   W.J. ``Bill'' Simpson, the camp's chief of security, has lived
here four years. He did not come to Loki as a humanitarian. He's a
former British military man, and this is just what he does.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before we arrived, Simpson was taken hostage in southern
Sudan, marched across the countryside and held for three days until
he was ransomed with food drops. He doesn't tell the story though;
he's too disciplined to be fazed by minor mishaps.
</P>
<P>
   Planes rumble off the airstrip at Loki all day long, bringing
grain from other parts of the world, leaving to drop food over
southern Sudan, ferrying relief workers into the area of the
famine.
</P>
<P>
   Rich and I were aboard a single-engine Cessna Caravan, flying
over southern Sudan. This was a step down from the Beechcraft which
had brought us to Loki from Nairobi, and that had been a step down
from the British Airways 747 which had brought us to Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the area is controlled by rebels who are fighting the
Sudanese government. Rich and I carried rebel visas, having
contributed the requisite $100 to the war effort.
</P>
<P>
   Areas below us showed evidence of flooding. This is the rainy
season _ one of the reasons that food can be brought in only by
air. Another reason is that there are hardly any roads.
</P>
<P>
   When you fly into southern Sudan in the rainy season, you never
know if you'll be able to land. If the airstrip is too wet when you
get there, the plane will take you back to Loki.
</P>
<P>
   As we arrived at the village of Ajiep, the pilot flew the plane
at an altitude of about 15 feet, eyeballing the landing strip out
the window. Judging it safe, he made his plan. He came around,
landed, braked _ and swerved around a soggy area he'd spotted
halfway down the runway.
</P>
<P>
   We got into two Land Cruisers and headed across the swamp.
</P>
<P>
   And got stuck. Up to the running boards.
</P>
<P>
   That did not faze the U.N. officials who had picked us up. They
jacked up one of the vehicles, put debris under the wheels and
drove it out. Then, using a long strap, they hooked the Land
Cruiser on dry ground to the one still stuck and tried to pull it
out.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing doing.
</P>
<P>
   So the driver of the first vehicle backed up, loosening the
strap and preparing to take a flying start. I retreated, fearing
the strap would snap, knocking my eyes out of my face.
</P>
<P>
   But the strap held. The Land Cruiser leapt out of the swamp like
a frog off a lily pad, and we were on our way.
</P>
<P>
   We have detailed, in words and photographs in an earlier edition
of this newspaper, the horrible human suffering we saw in south
Sudan. For the moment, it is enough to say that I will remember the
things I saw for the rest of my life.
</P>
<P>
   But the business of living and working went on.
</P>
<P>
   This was undeveloped grassland, the home of traditional African
tribes. I was not living at home or in a hotel room or even in a
tukul, but in a tent under a tree. I wasn't drinking water out of a
tap, or some of the bottled water for sale at the hotel in Nairobi,
or even the treated water available from a dispenser in the
Lokichokio mess hall.
</P>
<P>
   I was drinking Sudanese water that had been run through a filter
to strain out the guinea worm larvae; I have written about guinea
worm, and I don't want it. Into this I also dropped purification
tablets that made it taste like I was quaffing pints drawn from a
YMCA swimming pool. But better that than cholera.
</P>
<P>
   Flies by the hundreds crawled over our food. In the evening,
attacked by swarms of mosquitoes, I put on insect repellent strong
enough to peel the paint off a car.
</P>
<P>
   No longer was I presented with a choice of ``SITTING'' OR
``SQUATING.'' The latrine was a tukul built over a hole in the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   And a shower? I think not. The only thing to do was fill a
plastic tub with water and try to splash it into your armpits. It
was not very effective. I pretty much gave up and wore the same
shirt three days running.
</P>
<P>
   Just as our entry into Sudan depended on the airstrip being dry
enough, so did our departure. If it rained 10 days in a row, we'd
be stuck there 10 days, plus a couple more for the strip to dry
out. There would be no way to contact our families or our editors,
no way to let anyone know we were still alive.
</P>
<P>
   There were other hazards, too. While we were in Sudan, one of
the Cessnas came within 10 minutes of running out of fuel and was
forced to land in a government-held town. Granted permission to
leave, the plane refueled, took off and crashed in Loki, injuring
three people.
</P>
<P>
   This was bush flying, not like running an airlift out of
Hartsfield.
</P>
<P>
   It rained the night before we hoped to leave Ajiep, and we awoke
feeling so discouraged about our chances of leaving that day that
we didn't pack our stuff.
</P>
<P>
   A small plane arrived at midday, did a touch and go to test the
firmness of the air strip, decided it was OK _ and landed.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about breaking camp! We had those tents down and our stuff
packed in about 90 seconds and went roaring across the swamp in a
Land Cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't saying anything aloud, but in my mind a voice was
shouting: ``We're coming! Wait for us! Wait for us!''
</P>
<P>
   Three hours later, when we reached Loki again, I realized I had
been wrong. Loki wasn't primitive at all. It was a bastion of
civilization.
</P>
<P>
   There were buildings, drinkable water in the mess hall, a bed on
which to sleep and latrines that let me sit if I felt the need. And
what was one mosquito circling a light bulb compared to hundreds of
flies around the camp in Sudan?
</P>
<P>
   I wadded some clean clothes under my arm and skipped happily
from my tukul over to the community showers. I let the water pour
over my body. I soaped up, and soaped up again, then rinsed off,
looking up at the impossible blue of the sky overhead.
</P>
<P>
   It was, I think, the finest shower of my life.

 &HT;    Neiman civil case may send stores a message
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- When Diane Lynn Cooper received a pre-sale invitation
from Neiman Marcus two years ago, she drove to Lenox Square to buy
a cashmere sweater. She never made the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour of arriving, she had been handcuffed and
strip-searched in front of a male guard as a shoplifting suspect,
she contends.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper says store security guards so traumatized her that she
has nightmares. Neiman Marcus contends it's employees did not
strip-search Cooper and that the guards did nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper testified Neiman Marcus guards accosted her in the
parking lot and took her through the store handcuffed as she
screamed for help, believing she was being robbed and abducted.
</P>
<P>
   She testified the male and female guards made her strip to her
undergarments, then reached into her underwear.
</P>
<P>
   But Cooper, a 44-year-old computer software consultant who has
shopped the upscale store more than 20 years, had not taken
anything.
</P>
<P>
   This week, in the type of case that civil attorneys said rarely
gets to trial, she asked a federal jury for at least $2 million in
compensatory damages and enough in punitive damages to make the $2
billion department store chain take notice.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing a week of testimony, the jury must decide whether
Neiman Marcus is at fault or whether the department store is
shielded from liability by a Georgia law that allows store
personnel to detain someone if there is a reasonable suspicion the
person is a shoplifter. The jury, after deliberating almost three
hours, recessed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Neiman Marcus, while admitting that Cooper did not take
anything, strongly denies any improper conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have sympathy for Mrs. Cooper,'' the store's lawyer,
Robert Matthew Martin, told jurors during closing arguments. ``But
that sympathy cannot be the basis for your verdict.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin asked jurors to ``distinguish between Mrs. Cooper's
perception of what happened that day and what really occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, juries have returned million-dollar verdicts
against two stores _ a Dillard's chain in Kansas City, Kan., and an
Eddie Bauer branch in a Washington suburb _ in favor of plaintiffs
who claimed they were either wrongly stopped on suspicion of
shoplifting or denied service because they were African-American.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, who is white, is seeking damages on claims of false
imprisonment, assault and battery, infliction of emotional distress
and negligence.
</P>
<P>
   She testified that on Nov. 3, 1996, she picked out seven items
to try on and entered a lingerie fitting room.
</P>
<P>
   Security guards, seeing she was wearing a large coat and
carrying a large handbag, kept an eye on her. One guard testified
that Cooper looked suspicious because she had picked up a sweater
and was looking around as if she were going to conceal it.
</P>
<P>
   When Cooper took seven garments into a fitting room and emerged
with none, guards got even more suspicious. Guard Trina Laney went
into the stall and found only six of the seven items. The other
item was found later in an adjacent stall.
</P>
<P>
   Laney called for help and as Cooper walked outside, guard
Charles Gardiner, who like the other guards was wearing casual
attire, approached Cooper, who became frightened and started
walking away.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper testified that Gardiner blocked her way, flashed his
security badge and said he needed to talk to her about some
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper testified that she was suspicious and had turned back
toward the store when Gardiner grabbed her from behind and she
tried to get out of his grasp. Martin, the store's lawyer, said
Gardiner only placed his hand on her arm and when she moved away,
both Gardiner and Laney thought she was fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   The guards wrestled her to the ground and handcuffed her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in terror,'' Cooper testified. ``I was frightened to
death....They treated me with no dignity whatsoever. It was a very
dehumanizing experience. They violated me in the most personal
way.''
</P>
<P>
   When the guards got Cooper downstairs to the Loss Prevention
Office, Cooper testified, they could not find anything in her coat
or handbag so they started ripping her clothes off. Cooper said
when this happened she disrobed to her undergarments because she
felt she had no other choice.
</P>
<P>
   But Laney said no strip search occurred and that Cooper, who was
hysterical, voluntarily disrobed to prove she had stolen nothing.
``We did not want her to take her clothes off,'' Laney testified.
``But she was going to do whatever she wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper's attorney, Robert Hendrix, asked jurors to punish Neiman
Marcus with ``the severest of sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   And he reminded jurors that Atlanta Police Officer E.R. Polk,
who investigated the case, testified Neiman Marcus security guards
told him they had strip-searched her.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrix accused Neiman Marcus witnesses of ``disinformation,
lies maybe....They have the gall to say she damaged herself. It's
outrageous for them to suggest that this was a voluntary
striptease.''
</P>
<P>
   But Martin said store guards acted professionally and used no
more force than necessary.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the guards and another witness, store manager Mary
Lee Ward, saw Cooper disrobe on her own accord as the guards asked
her to stop.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was ``unprecedented,'' worsened by the fact that
Cooper thought she was being abducted when she wasn't, Martin said.
``Had she simply followed Charles Gardiner and Trina Laney back
into the store, we wouldn't be here today....Her perception is not
our fault.''

   SAN GIOVANNI ROTONDO, Italy _ In 1959, a celebrated Capuchin
monk and mystic named Padre Pio was shown the new brick church that
was added to the monastery to accommodate his many followers.
``What are you building, a matchbox?'' he told his fellow monks.
``Make it bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Padre Pio, who died in 1968 at the age of 81, was right. That
church has proved far too cramped to handle the six million to
seven million pilgrims who travel each year to the monastery on a
remote mountaintop of Pulgia, in southern Italy, seeking his solace
and healing powers. Thirty years after his death, Padre Pio has not
yet been recognized as a saint by the Vatican, but he attracts more
visitors than Lourdes or the shrine of St. Francis of Assisi.
</P>
<P>
   His is a vast, worldwide following that blends medieval piety
with a kind of modern cult celebrity, and commercialism, usually
associated with Elvis Presley. Padre Pio, who came to prominence in
1918 when, according to his followers, he began bleeding profusely
from his hands, feet and side, is the first priest to bear stigmata
since St. Francis in the 13th century. His devotees also believe
that he was endowed with other supernatural gifts, including the
ability to be in two places at once and to emit a powerful scent of
flowers.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, where his portrait can be spotted in taxis, dry
cleaners, post offices and fashion boutiques, he sells more
magazines than the late Princess of Wales. Sightings of Padre Pio
are reported more often than UFO's.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of pilgrims travel to his tomb in cut-rate charter bus
tours that include product demonstration sales pitches _ shopping
channels on wheels. The streets of San Giovanni Rotondo are overrun
with souvenir vendors who sell Padre Pio statuettes, Padre Pio
lighters, Padre Pio snow shakers, miniature Padre Pio guitar-shaped
prayer books, Padre Pio liqueur and rose-scented Padre Pio air
fresheners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has nothing to do with us,'' said Joseph Pius Martin, a
Brooklyn-born Capuchin who is one of 22 monks who tend Padre Pio's
memory. ``We didn't want them to turn this into a junky country
fair.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the monks hope to add a touch of class. Flush with
donations and anticipation that Padre Pio will soon be beatified,
the Capuchins commissioned Renzo Piano, the Italian architect who
designed the Georges Pompidou Center in Paris and the Osaka
airport, to erect nearby a huge, ultra-modern shell-like church.
Roy Lichtenstein contributed to the interior before his death in
1997, and Robert Rauschenberg is also providing artwork. It is a
startlingly contemporary tribute to a monk whose life and work
seems lifted directly from the Middle Ages.
</P>
<P>
   Padre Pio, who was born Francesco Forgione, the son of
impoverished farm workers, was a sickly, deeply pious child. Before
he was ordained, he alarmed his elders with his fasts, fainting
spells and self-flagellation. To this day, he is credited with
countless miracles and intercessions, everything from healing
incurable cancer to finding people jobs and ridding their
apartments of mice.
</P>
<P>
   Even people with rather secular preoccupations have sought Padre
Pio's help. Peppino Amato, the late producer of Fellini's film ``La
Dolce Vita,'' once told friends that in a 1959 audience with Padre
Pio, the monk silently instructed him to finance the movie.
</P>
<P>
   This year, as every year, 70,000 people gathered in San Giovanni
for a 24-hour vigil on the anniversary of his death on Sept. 23.
This year, for the first time, the vigil and Mass was transmitted
live on the Internet (www.sangiovannirotondo.com).
</P>
<P>
   His followers are more passionate about him than they are about
the Pope. ``I don't trust priests, and I don't like the church,''
said Gloria Tucto, a 36-year-old nurse. ``But I believe in Padre
Pio.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican took the first step toward recognizing Padre Pio as
a saint last year, when he was declared ``venerable.'' But while he
was alive, and for years after his death, Rome took a dim view.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican ordered at least 12 investigations of Padre Pio and
numerous reprimands. From time to time he was barred from
celebrating Mass or hearing confession.
</P>
<P>
   One of the last Vatican investigators, the Rev. Carlo Maccari,
reported to Rome in 1960 that Padre Pio had sex with female
penitents twice a week. A fellow monk sneaked a microphone into
Padre Pio's rooms to find out if Padre Pio was preying on women.
(According to the Capuchin publication The Voice of Padre Pio,
Maccari, who became an archbishop, later recanted and prayed to
Padre Pio on his deathbed.)
</P>
<P>
   But Padre Pio's fame and following grew, regardless of Rome's
mistrust. Visitors included the actress Loretta Young, and a newly
ordained Polish priest, Karol Wojtyla, in 1947. There is a legend
that at that meeting, Padre Pio predicted that Father Wojtyla would
someday become Pope, but Pope John Paul II recently denied it. But
he has never hid his belief in Padre Pio, whose tomb he visited in
1987, which was taken as a sign that sainthood would be imminent.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II, who has canonized more than 270 people and
beatified close to 800, has made more saints than any other in
history. He has streamlined the procedure and reduced the number of
required miracles from four to one.
</P>
<P>
   But the vetting process in the office of the Congregation of the
Causes of Saints is notoriously slow. A pious life and good works,
moreover, are more valued in today's church than miracles and
mystical doings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elevation, mystification, stigmata are not signs of sanctity,
even though the public goes in for such things,'' said the Rev.
Peter Gumpel, a former top official in the Congregation for the
Causes of Saints. Father Gumpel, a Jesuit, added drily: ``We are
rather skeptical of such things. They can be a hindrance to the
promotion of a cause.''
</P>
<P>
   One church-appointed medical board recently approved Padre Pio's
miracle _ he is credited with curing a 42-year-old woman in Salerno
in 1995 who was due for surgery for a buildup of lymphatic fluid in
her chest, which disappeared after she prayed to Padre Pio. Two
more church boards must approve it before he can be beatified. A
second miracle would have to be approved for canonization.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the anticipation and the Pope's public homage to the monk
unleashed a Padre Pio boom in the early 1990's that was fed into a
kind of frenzy by Italy's mass media.
</P>
<P>
   Gente, an Italian weekly magazine similar to People, has a major
article on Padre Pio in almost every issue, everything from
accounts of his many miracles to Padre Pio recipes for apple nut
cake, to which the magazine attributes miraculous side effects.
(The editor, Sandro Mayer, told Epoca magazine that Padre Pio came
to him in a dream in 1995, struck him over the head and said, ``Why
are you ignoring me?'')
</P>
<P>
   The cult of Padre Pio sells magazines, television shows and
kitschy souvenirs, but it has also brought tourists and jobs to a
town that would otherwise be mired in the same high unemployment
and poverty that afflicts much of southern Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The Mayor, Davide Pio Fini, who was baptized by Padre Pio, said,
``Padre Pio is our salvation.'' But others in town have mixed
feelings about how their patron savior is exploited.
</P>
<P>
   ``My employer is Padre Pio,'' said Nicola Di Cosmo, a driver and
part-time tourist guide. ``If not for him I would be a guest
laborer in Germany. But I don't like this mixture of spirituality
and commerce.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While congressional Republicans say President
Clinton's own conduct forces them to march ahead past Election Day
down the road toward impeachment, they are also motivated by a
sense that the White House scandal is beginning to exact a toll
from Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Those Republicans willing to discuss their strategies said they
were undaunted by Clinton's seemingly untouchable job approval
ratings. They said their considerations go far deeper than polls
and involve matters such as the subtleties of voter turnout, the
demographic makeup of House districts and a wide perception that
Democrats are on the defensive and have been hard pressed to convey
their messages to voters.
</P>
<P>
   While the political results of the Lewinsky scandal are still
largely amorphous, it is nevertheless possible to point out ways
that it could damage Democrats. After all, a weak candidate may be
a weak candidate with or without the scandal. The biggest peril,
Democrats say, is in very close races where, if realized,
projections of a dip in turnout among Democrats who are enraged by
Clinton could cost them the election, particularly if Republicans
vote in greater numbers than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in a presidential election year when the candidates'
prime concern is appealing to swing voters, many contenders for
Congress this year are far more worried about prodding members of
their own party to go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great danger to Republicans would be to tell their base
that the party is shutting down the inquiry for whatever reason
before the election,'' said former Rep. Vin Weber, R-Minn., who is
close to Speaker Newt Gingrich. ``Right now, the turnout model is
favorable to Republicans because of indignation over the
president's situation among base Republican voters.'' That
advantage would be forfeited, he said, if there is ``any perception
that Republicans have cut a deal to sweep this under the rug.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party officials in Washington are especially worried
about a handful of open House seats that have become tossups, races
where the Democrats were initially considered stronger,
better-financed candidates. Among the Democratic House candidates
in that situation are Ken Lucas in Kentucky, Baron Hill in Indiana
and Ronnie Shows in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Another troubling sign for Democrats is that many of the most
hotly contested House seats are in districts with small percentages
of black voters. Blacks are always among the most loyal Democrats
and are least likely to turn on the president or the party. An
increasing number of Republican incumbents are breaking through 50
percent support in the polls _ an important threshold in assessing
the strength of a candidate going into the general election.
</P>
<P>
   In California, for example, Sen. Barbara Boxer, a Democrat,
faces a tough challenge from Matt Fong, who is slightly ahead in
the latest polls. But the Fong campaign hopes that voters are put
off by Ms. Boxer's close connection to the president. (Her daughter
is married to the brother of Hillary Rodham Clinton.)
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk to Republican offices, they're getting 20-1
telephone calls, faxes and e-mails saying, `Impeach the guy
tomorrow!''' said Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax
Reform and an adviser to Gingrich. ``Democrats are not making a
case to their base,'' Norquist said. ``There's no wing of their
party that's in favor of mauling women.''
</P>
<P>
   An official in the Democratic congressional leadership, speaking
on the condition of anonymity, did not dispute the assessment.
``There's a reason our members are nervous,'' the official said.
``In a lot of these marginal districts, we have no base.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, even some Republicans recognize the risk in prolonging
the impeachment inquiry. They warn that the longer it persists, the
better the chance that it might embolden angry Democrats to go to
the polls to vent their outrage at Republicans for prolonging the
scandal for partisan reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to be careful how they conduct themselves,'' Weber
said of his Republican colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   As Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader,
warned Wednesday, ``I think that the more partisan this whole
matter becomes, the less tolerant the American people will be and
the more difficult it will be to bring this process to a successful
conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Cook Jr., an independent political analyst, said he
expects that Democrats will rise up and accuse Republicans of
needlessly prolonging the inquiry. ``I'd still rather be a
Republican than a Democrat this year,'' Cook said. ``But I think
they're playing with fire here.''
</P>
<P>
   The jubilation among Republicans may be premature. Party
officials and strategists are fond of reeling off contests that
have appeared increasingly competitive in recent weeks, including
races for Democratic-held Senate seats in Wisconsin, California and
Illinois. Yet those races may have tightened because candidates
have filled the airwaves recently with television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gingrich Wednesday scoffed at the suggestion that
Republicans were guided by polls _ or that they should note
Clinton's high job approval ratings and try to complete their
inquiry. ``I think people would be frankly horrified if the
Congress was simply a polling institution that enacted a grotesque
version of justice based on the latest poll or the latest talk
show,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Republicans move, unabashedly, toward impeachment, the
possible repercussions for Election Day are very much on their
minds.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the central witness in Congress' consideration
of impeachment proceedings, Monica Lewinsky has provided an account
of her affair with President Clinton that, paradoxically, both
Whitewater prosecutors and White House lawyers have seized upon to
support elements of their cases.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is particularly unusual because Ms. Lewinsky has
acknowledged in her testimony that she repeatedly lied to those
closest to her. So far, neither the president's lawyers nor anyone
in Congress has raised a question about Ms. Lewinsky's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers say her grand jury testimony, released on
Monday by Congress, conclusively proves that no one ever asked her
to lie about her affair and that the effort to find her a job was
not part of any improper attempt to buy her silence.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors maintain that her testimony proves conclusively that
Clinton repeatedly lied under oath when he said he did not have a
sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, and that he could not recall
ever meeting with her alone.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides also point to her testimony in arguing that the
president either committed obstruction or did not commit
obstruction when Ms. Lewinsky gave a box of presidential gifts to
Clinton's secretary rather than comply with a subpoena for the
gifts issued by the president's opponents in the Paula Jones
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   By her own admission in her grand jury appearances and in
interviews with prosecutors, Ms. Lewinsky lied at various points to
Clinton, Vernon Jordan, her own lawyer and Linda Tripp. She also
admits filing an affidavit that was not truthful.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky testified that she lied to Mrs. Tripp on Jan. 13
when she said that it was only in exchange for a job that she would
sign an affidavit in the Jones case supporting the president's
claim that the couple had no sexual relationship. The conversation,
which was secretly being recorded by Mrs. Tripp and the FBI, became
one of several bases for the expansion of Starr's inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining to grand jurors why she lied to Mrs. Tripp on
several occasions, including the Jan. 13 meeting, Ms. Lewinsky
said: ``I was so desperate for her to _ I was _ for her to not
reveal anything about this relationship that I used anything and
anybody that I could think of as leverage with her. I _ her, the
president, my mom, everybody. I mean, not her, but Jordan, the
president, my mom. Anybody that I thought would have any kind of
influence on her, I used.''
</P>
<P>
   Some investigators believe that Ms. Lewinsky was actually being
truthful to Mrs. Tripp and that her testimony was intended to
protect Jordan and Clinton, two men whom she has repeatedly said
she had no desire to hurt. The impeachment report does not cite
that conversation as evidence of obstruction, perhaps because Ms.
Lewinsky cast doubt about the truth of what she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky also testified that she misled the president when
she assured him that she had told no one of their relationship. She
told the grand jurors that she was dishonest with Jordan when she
denied to him that she had had a sexual relationship with Clinton.
She also denied the relationship to her lawyer, who helped prepare
her false affidavit in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these admissions, it is clear from the impeachment
report that Kenneth Starr and his staff came to believe Ms.
Lewinsky's version of the intimate nature of her relationship with
Clinton. She kept detailed notes of the encounters, told friends
and others about them, and related details of the visits that the
prosecutors were able to corroborate.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress decides to hold impeachment hearings, Ms. Lewinsky
is certain to become the central witness. On Wednesday both
Democratic and Republican lawmakers said once again that they had
not reached conclusions about her credibility.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``In studying this, we are going to have to be very careful
because the issue is `What was the intent of the president of the
United States when he did certain things or said certain things?'''
said Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., a member of the Judiciary
Committee. ``And who do you believe _ what is the credibility of
Monica Lewinsky or Betty Currie or any number of the other
witnesses, the 11 corroborating witnesses supposedly, who were
contemporaneously told about some of these acts by Monica
Lewinsky?''
</P>
<P>
   But the skirmishing between the White House and the independent
counsel's office over Ms. Lewinsky's testimony has already begun.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McCurry, Clinton's spokesman, said Wednesday that the
referral ``chose to ignore'' the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky that was
helpful to the president over the issue of whether Clinton directed
Ms. Lewinsky to lie.
</P>
<P>
   Starr responded in a statement Wednesday afternoon that the
impeachment referral mentioned in two places that Ms. Lewinsky had
testified that the president did not explicitly direct her to lie
about their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers also relied on Ms. Lewinsky's testimony in a
letter sent to the Republican and the Democratic leaders of the
House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday. The lawyers wrote that Ms.
Lewinsky's testimony that tended to exculpate Clinton was
purposefully ignored in the impeachment referral Starr sent
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   That charge was denied by Robert Bittman, a deputy independent
counsel, who cited three places in the report that made reference
to the testimony the White House said was ignored. Bittman closed
his letter by noting that the White House has yet to challenge Ms.
Lewinsky's account.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is noteworthy,'' he wrote, ``that their letter accepts the
credibility of Ms. Lewinsky on these issues, which should indicate
that they have no intention of challenging Ms. Lewinsky's
credibility on other matters.''

BUILDERS WANT NEW HOMES TO BE PAST PERFECT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GAILE ROBINSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The two upstart home builders look like they were minted by
Central Casting. They are solid and clean-cut, earnest types from
the Texas Ex mold.
</P>
<P>
   Even their names seem a little Hollywood. Rob Sell makes the
sales; he's the big, loquacious, 27-year-old partner with an
extra-firm handshake, and a brochure for a Zig Ziglar seminar on
his desk.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dike, 28, is compact and quiet. He manages the job site.
</P>
<P>
   They met in Austin in 1994, shortly after they graduated from
UT. It was there that they began driving the stately neighborhoods
of Tarrytown and along Enfield Road, taking photographs of the
great houses.
</P>
<P>
   Sell and Dike were feeding their fantasy. Someday, they would
build houses that looked like the old ones. They would give buyers
a neighborhood of charm and individuality. They would equip their
new homes with multijet bathtubs with the interesting architectural
elements of the old.
</P>
<P>
   Today, they are doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   Sell, Dike, and their financial partner Jim Harris, an
experienced developer, are the principals behind Village Homes.
They have completed 21 houses and have several more under
construction on Riverwood Trails and Manorwood Trails in Stonegate.
That's the tony enclave behind Calloways on Hulen Street. Their
houses are mixed in with those of other builders, but you can pick
them out. Village Homes do not look like the other houses, nor do
they look like one another.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-story, flat-fronted, Grey Poupon-colored house with two
copper gutters that border the elaborately carved front door is a
Village Home. Another is the still-under-construction 1-story brick
with tile roof and a loggia along the front that echoes the deep
porches of early Texas haciendas. On the sales of this eclectic
inventory, the 2-year-old company is poised to break ground on the
big vision: Trinity Heights, a planned neighborhood in southwest
Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Harris, Dike and Sell took the best acreage, the center
cut, of their tract and made it a park. The houses will surround
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, builders put the park or green belt in the flood
plain where they can't build anyway,'' Sell says.
</P>
<P>
   They want the park to give the houses a large, sweeping stage.
Because the houses will command such a heroic presence, they must
have an approved architectural lineage. Dike and Sell will be the
arbiters of what is considered good taste. They will not allow any
of those ``North Dallas, big-hair houses,'' Sell says. There will
be no 2-story doorways, no false roof lines, no brick facades with
back sides covered in siding.
</P>
<P>
   If potential buyers or builders have any questions about what is
acceptable, Sell has a book full of photographs of old houses that
he is happy to share. These are the photos he has gathered over the
past several years. He has them classified into categories: English
Tudor, Italian Renaissance, French eclectic, Craftsman, Greek
revival, prairie style and such.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think if we show them pictures, they will have some idea of
what we mean,'' Dike says.
</P>
<P>
   Sell has found that doesn't always compute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I showed our pictures to one builder; I know he doesn't agree
with our philosophy, and he said, `That's just a box; that's too
plain.' So I know a lot of 'em don't get it,'' Sell says.
</P>
<P>
   Those builders may recognize their homes in the section labeled,
``unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   The positive photos show roof lines with a pitch steeper than
that of a black diamond ski run, shutters that actually work,
barrel-vaulted ceilings, round-topped front doors and functional
window boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Sell and Dike have put their stamp of approval on English
cottages, Italian facades and details from the prairie style. They
even like them interbred. Often, they mix elements from different
continents and centuries in the same home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're architecture buffs,'' says Sell, who was so inspired by
the 1940s style bungalows in ``L.A. Confidential'' that he built
something similar in Stonegate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized that in any of the older neighborhoods _ in
Houston, Dallas, or Fort Worth _ people pay a premium for charming
houses in spite of the fact they have no insulation in the walls,
outdated bathrooms, small closets, bad kitchens. And they seldom
have security systems. But the houses have character, and people
pay to be in these neighborhoods. They are doing it for reasons
architectural,'' Sell says.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the interior details of their homes will echo the period
of the exterior. Coves, barrel vaults, curved walls and appropriate
moldings are used sparingly and, because they are placed
judiciously, the effect is dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   One of Village Homes; first clients was Dessie Pierce . She
wanted an older home with a classic look, one she could fix up the
way she wanted. After searching the old Fort Worth neighborhoods
and not finding anything to her liking, she worked with Dike and
Sell to create her quasi-classical dream house from the ground up.
</P>
<P>
   Dike and Sell try to build affordable houses for the
non-financially challenged. Stonegate homes began with a top dollar
figure of $275,000, but as time passed and buyers and builders have
gotten involved, the prices are beginning to top $400,000. Village
Homes has three lots left to fill in Stonegate, then the operation
will move to Trinity Heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to start our homes in the $200,000-$250,000 range,''
Dike says. ``It isn't a starter home figure, but it's a reasonable
price that the majority of people can afford.''
</P>
<P>
   They are proud of their work, and because their homes do not
have a recognizable stamp, they put a cornerstone on every house
they build. The tasteful, ivory brick is inscribed with the Village
Homes logo and the year the house was built.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies that do the best to establish their reputation
put their names on their products for brand-name awareness,'' Sell
says. ``Decades from now, people will know we built their house.''

KOHL'S ELECTION FOE RUNS SLICK CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BONN _ In the early 1980s, after a night of alcohol-fueled
political discussion in this Rhine River city that is the national
capital, Gerhard Schroeder grabbed the fence outside the
chancellor's residence and shouted, ``I want in there!''
</P>
<P>
   The story is part of the rakish charm of Schroeder, the man who
is out to take Germany's top political job Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The political pollsters say Schroeder is close to his goal. He
holds a nerve-rackingly slim lead over Helmut Kohl, the incumbent
chancellor who has won his place in German history as the man who
reunited a country that for 40 years was ground zero for the Cold
War.
</P>
<P>
   But Kohl has been in office so long that many people say they're
tired of seeing him on the evening news. Schroeder has skillfully
appealed to this ``Kohl must go'' mood, running a campaign that is
partly modeled after Bill Clinton's 1992 push for change after 12
years of Republican control of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   After respectfully acknowledging Kohl's ``historic
accomplishments,'' Schroeder's stump speech criticizes the older
man as ``used up,'' as ``the chancellor of the past who is unfit
for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Schroeder's campaign slickly packages its telegenic
candidate as the man who can lead Germany out of the economic funk
that has put 11 percent of the population out of work, the highest
number since the turbulent days of the 1930s that saw Adolf Hitler
come to power.
</P>
<P>
   Schroder stays on his economic message so well that his campaign
slogan might as well be, ``It's the economy, Dummkopf!''
</P>
<P>
   In a passionate speech Monday during a slickly staged campaign
rally in the new Cologne Arena, he told 18,000 cheering supporters
that Germany could not afford more ``stagnation and inertia'' under
Kohl. He promised new training for the unemployed and lower taxes
for middle-income workers.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, like Clinton and Britain's Tony Blair, prime minister
and head of the Labor Party, is trying to push a traditionally
left-of-center party to the right. He says he wants to move away
from the orthodox politics of his Social Democratic Party toward a
``New Center'' that makes room for small-business owners who have
traditionally leaned toward Kohl's Christian Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Some political wags have dubbed Schroeder ``Gerhard
Clintonblair.'' And one newspaper capped a story about Schroder's
call for economic reforms with a headline that invoked both Blair
and Winston Churchill's World War II summons to sacrifice. The
paper declared that Schroeder was offering ``Blair, sweat and
tears.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohl charges that Schroeder offers little more than a vague
package of anti-Kohl slogans. He warns that Germans should permit
``no experiments,'' and his campaign posters, along the streets of
hundreds of farm villages and factories, promise ``security instead
of risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's greatest strength, the solid image of a man who has
stayed in office while Ronald Reagan and George Bush and Margaret
Thatcher left the stage, is the flip side of his tiring image as
``the eternal chancellor.'' According to William Chandler, a
political science professor at the University of California-San
Diego, Kohl's recent climb in the polls can be tied to fears about
electing a new leader at a time when Russia's turmoil threatens to
spin out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is anxiety here about what is happening over there (in
Russia),'' said Chandler, who is in Bonn to observe the election.
This is not a U.S.-style race, with voters choosing from among
competing candidates. In this parliamentary system, voters directly
choose their representatives with one vote and use a second vote
for one of the many competing political parties.
</P>
<P>
   The chancellorship goes to the top candidate of the majority
party, but since Germany's multiparty system seldom produces a
clear winner, governments here are built on coalitions like the one
Kohl heads with the Free Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition system is a problem for Schroeder. For while many
Germans are weary of the stodgy Kohl, they are wary of the leftist
Greens who are a possible partner for Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   The Greens, who surged to prominence in the 1980s with a program
of pacifism and environmental protection, have aroused alarm with
proposals to triple gasoline prices to $12 a gallon and to pull
Germany out of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Greens are off in cuckoo land,'' said Gerald Kleinfeld, an
Arizona State University history professor who is also in Germany
for the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the campaign moves tensely toward its Sunday climax,
there is talk of ``a great coalition'' of the Social Democrats and
the Christian Democrats. Such a merger of the traditional foes
could have the ironic result of pushing both Kohl and Schroeder out
of the chancellor picture.
</P>
<P>
   And that in turn would have the ironic effect of producing
postwar Germany's biggest experiment of all. &QL;

SENATE VOTES TO TIGHTEN RULES ON CONSUMER BANKRUPTCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (cb) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to
overhaul the bankruptcy system and make it more difficult for
consumers to walk away from their debts.
</P>
<P>
   The sweeping clampdown on consumers, especially those who are
perceived as able to repay their debts, reflects a strong sense in
Congress that widespread abuse of the bankruptcy system has spurred
a record number of personal bankruptcies in each of the last three
years despite the booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   In making it harder for debtors to walk away from their unpaid
bills, the legislation would help banks and credit-card companies
recoup billions of dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The free ride is over,'' said Senator Charles Grassley, the
Iowa Republican who shepherded the bill to passage.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed by a lopsided vote of 97 to 1. Only Senator Paul
Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota, voted against it. He said he was
offended by the relentless, multimillion-dollar lobbying effort by
banks and credit-card companies on behalf of the bill and that
consumers were ``left out of the loop.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday's vote does not guarantee that the bill will find
its way into law. The Senate version must now be reconciled with a
House version, which is vastly different, and time is running out
for lawmakers to reach an accord.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does Congress plan to adjourn in less than three weeks,
but the members who must resolve the differences between the two
bills have less time than others. The bills started in the
judiciary committees in each house, which means those committees
must send members to the joint House-Senate conference to reconcile
the bills. But the House Judiciary Committee is so consumed with
whether to impeach President Clinton, it seems to have little time
for other matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are wondering if Judiciary has the time,''
said Senator Grassley. ``It's a major problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the Clinton Administration has left itself
considerable leeway for final negotiations on the bill. In a
statement of policy, officials said they generally supported the
Senate version but wanted a final bill to curtail abuses by
creditors, not just debtors. It was not clear whether the Senate
bill, which does address creditor abuse to some degree, went far
enough for the Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Senate and House, which passed its bill in June,
spurned numerous attempts by Democrats to tighten the rules on
banks and credit-card companies to make them more accountable for
lending practices that lure consumers, even those already heavily
in debt, with solicitations for additional credit.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate version, however, would require banks and credit card
companies to disclose to consumers in every monthly bill how much
they will owe over the months _ or, more likely, years _ in
accumulated debt and interest if they make only the minimum
payment.
</P>
<P>
   And the Senate bill would crack down on people who move to
states like Florida and Texas, which protect them if they put all
their money into expensive houses and then file for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The Administration has called the House bill too stringent. That
version, much preferred by the bank and credit-card industries,
imposes an income test on those who seek protection from creditors
under Chapter 7, which simply erases most debt.
</P>
<P>
   But by contrast, the more lenient Senate version gives judges
some discretion in determining whether someone files under Chapter
7 or goes through a more rigorous repayment schedule under Chapter
13.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the bills in both houses are grounded in a similar
philosophy that the White House seems to share _ that filing for
bankruptcy has become too easy and, with a record 1.35 million
consumers filing in 1997, unfairly cost American business $40
billion in that year alone.
</P>
<P>
   Credit-card lending is among the most profitable sectors of the
banking industry, which otherwise has little room for growth. The
industry estimates that the bills in both houses could help them
recoup $4 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democratic Senators who had spoken out earlier against the
bill wound up voting for it. One was Senator Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts. His spokesman, Jim Manley, said Kennedy believed
that the Senate version was so preferable to the House version that
he wanted to give confidence to Senate conferees that they should
stand firm when negotiating with the House.
</P>
<P>
   But many longtime allies of those Democrats were disappointed
with the vote. Gary Klein, director of the National Consumer Law
Center, said the Senate's provisions were better than the House's,
but added: ``It is unclear whether those provisions are strong
enough to prevent abusive marketing practices prevalent in the
extension of consumer credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Warren, a professor at Harvard Law School who has
worked against the bill, applauded the Senate for acknowledging for
the first time that credit-card companies were responsible for some
consumer debt. But she still thought it was a bad bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can democratically elected representatives vote to
transfer wealth from financially troubled families to corporate
lenders who are making record profits?'' she asked.

COPS AND BOBBERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB WHEAT  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The stresses of law enforcement are many, and,
like other professionals, many police officers turn to fishing for
release and relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of cops and former officers have parlayed their
love of angling into lucrative businesses or have otherwise
established marks for themselves in the sport-fishing industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I take off my police detective's hat, I put on my fishing
hat and try to focus on that,'' said Ron Cervenka, a Burbank
homicide and robbery detective from Saugus who directs the Southern
California division of the Western Outdoors News Bass
team-tournament circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Going to work to Cervenka can mean confronting an armed robbery.
He balances that by registering anglers for the bass contests or
baiting a hook on the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's harder to catch the bass than the crooks, and
sometimes it's harder to catch the crooks than the bass,'' said
Cervenka, who also fishes tournaments professionally, guides other
anglers, teaches ``Introduction to Bass Fishing'' at College of the
Canyons and coordinates the annual ``Bassing for Abused Kids''
fund-raiser at Castaic Lake. He plans to write an instructional
book about his experiences titled, ``Hookin' &AMP; Bookin'.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his best-laid plans, Cervenka occasionally takes his
work with him and has at times had to cancel out of bass
tournaments because he's had to prepare for or go to court.
</P>
<P>
   ``That can be devastating to your point standings and money
totals, which are added up at the end of a tournament season,'' he
said. ``These are the things that qualify you for larger events,
and you can be eliminated if you miss one or a couple events.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the bottom line is that my No.1 job is being a police
officer. And I still get a little time to do some hookin', as well
as some bookin'.''
</P>
<P>
   Disaster struck in January 1994, the day Bill Mulvihill was
ready to open shop.
</P>
<P>
   Mulvihill, who retired last month as a Los Angeles Police
Department traffic officer after 29 years, was looking forward to
opening his jig-making business. But the Northridge Earthquake hit
and he found himself picking up the pieces of his dream instead.
</P>
<P>
   Mother Nature didn't deter him, and today his fishing lures are
in four stores around the San Fernando Valley. He works closely
with bass-angling guru and industry icon Don Iovino on tapping the
overseas market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started making jigs for myself and it grew from there,'' he
said. ``Things really got going when I got a couple of Japanese
orders after I first opened, and had to work a lot of hours making
jigs while working light duty on the force.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulvihill was designated to light duty after his 15 years of
motorcycle work wore down the tendons and nerves in his arms,
shoulder and hands. Despite those troubles, he and his wife
hand-tie each jig in his Reseda garage. They are wary about
expanding the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I think about branching out, but I think I'd better
keep it small and manageable,'' Mulvihill said. ``That way I'll
still have time to do what I love: fish!''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Crupi seemingly has answered the question every day since
March 12, 1991: Why'd you throw it back?
</P>
<P>
   That's when Crupi, a 24-year veteran LAPD motorcycle officer
with the Valley division, caught a 22.01-pound largemouth bass at
Castaic Lake. It is the second-largest recorded bass in the world.
Crupi let the fish go ... and would do it again in a heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys at the station understood, but a lot of people asked,
`Why'd you let it go. How much was it worth?' '' said Crupi, who
resides in Castaic. ``You tell me, because at the time there wasn't
any sponsor who was stepping to the plate with the money, until
recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there's a place to go and collect I think $5 million for
the world record bass.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll have to settle for the image as catch-and-release poster
boy ... and a cop who today runs a successful bass-fishing guide
business and hunts big game in the wilds of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fishing is like being on a stakeout,'' Crupi said. ``Just like
the bad guys, you learn the fish's MO or how they operate, their
`perp time' or when the fish are most active and anything else that
might help you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Law enforcement has taught me to be patient and to wait on the
big fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Daniels said it was the funniest thing he had ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   One of Daniels' customers on his mackinaw trout charter boat at
Lake Tahoe got pulled over for speeding. Daniels, then the town
constable for Carnelian Bay, listened with amusement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a talker and a half and he told me all about this jerk
in green who pulled him over and how he'd like to give him a piece
of his mind,'' Daniels said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I knew who the (the Placer County Sheriff's deputy) was
and it just happened that the same deputy was hanging out by the
dock to say hello. So I yelled, `Hey, `Joe,' is this the jerk who
pulled you over that you wanted to talk to?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, this particular deputy was a big, heavy-set guy. He was
clued into the joke and said, `Yeah, Joe, you got something to
say?' Joe had to go back to the (restroom) to regain his composure
for a few minutes and we fell about the dock laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniels of nearby Agate Bay retired in 1997 after 29 years in
law enforcement _ first as a deputy, later as a highway patrolman
and then as a constable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the law-enforcement job that allowed me to be a
fisherman,'' said Daniels, who opened his charter business in 1969.
``Of course, being a constable is a one-man operation, but the
courts aren't as busy as they are in L.A. So I could fish in the
morning because of the lighter case load and I had other duties in
the evening _ evictions, wage garnishments, serving papers and
patrol work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that probably both jobs _ fishing and law enforcement _
are the best ones that a guy could have got.''
</P>
<P>
   Pete Haynes said no two occupations lend themselves to greater
stories than his _ LAPD motorcycle officer and Izorline fishing
line representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the most unbelievable thing I have ever seen,
but it's true,'' said Haynes, who retired in 1989 after a
quarter-century on the force and now resides in Malibu's Trancas
Canyon. ``This guy was fishing using a kite, where you have the
line dangle on the surface of the water. Fortunately for me, he was
also using my brand of line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fish surfaces but comes up tail first, which really didn't
make sense. Well, this guy caught a 100-pound tuna with the hook,
but the line had collected on the water when it was released from
the kite and a second fish was unlucky enough to be swimming by at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``So a second fish got snagged on a half-inch knot that had
tangled on the surface, and he ended up bringing two 100-pound tuna
on board, both caught with the same line.''
</P>
<P>
   Haynes said he loved being a police officer, ``But when you have
an opportunity to earn money doing something you love, something
you don't mind talking 24 hours a day about ... well, it's like
I've died and gone to heaven.''

CHINA PLANS TO SPEND $1 TRILLION ON BIG PUBLIC PROJECTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By SETH FAISON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Chinese leaders expect to weather the Asian economic
crisis by spending so much money on public works that they reverse
slowing growth, deter unemployment and reverse the fall in exports,
a senior official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Zeng Peiyan, minister in charge of the State
Development Planning Commission, also reiterated pledges by China
not to devalue its currency, the yuan. Talk of devaluation has been
a source of anxiety in global financial markets, partly because
plunging currencies in Southeast Asia last year led to the region's
financial and economic crises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we have no need to devalue,'' Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
   Assessing China's economic outlook, he said the nation is
proceeding with plans to spend $1.2 trillion on a vast program of
new infrastructure projects over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Although some economists question whether China can spend that
much, Zeng said that falling exports to Asian neighbors meant the
country must spend aggressively if it wanted to reach an 8 percent
growth rate target this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only if overall fixed-asset investment grows by 15 to 18
percent, can we reach 8 percent economic growth,'' Zeng said at a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Recent economic statistics are encouraging, if not conclusive.
In August, investment by the government in fixed assets _ which
covers such projects as highways, bridges and power grids _ totaled
158.1 billion yuan, or about $19 billion, up 26.9 percent from a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Zeng pointed to that figure as an indication that officials were
starting to carry out China's spending plans, first disclosed in
March as a $1 trillion public works plan. In the face of questions
about how China could find $1 trillion to spend for such public
investment, officials here recently expanded their plans by $200
billion, to a total of $1.2 trillion, or 10 trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing such a figure for the spending package suggests that
China's leaders intend to convey a psychological as well as a
financial stimulant to their efforts to reignite a faltering
economy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Whatever the actual size of the outlays, however, the direction
China's leaders want to take the economy is clear.
</P>
<P>
   To reverse a falling growth rate _ which declined to 7 percent
in the first half of this year from 8.8 percent in 1997 and is the
slowest since 1991 _ Chinese leaders plan to expand highway and
railroad construction, build bridges, upgrade electricity service
in the provinces and start water-conservation projects that are
needed after the summer's severe floods.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Beijing recently announced plans to spend at least
60 billion yuan to rebuild the country's rural power grid over the
next three years, making electricity cheaper and more available to
consumers who are starting to buy electrical appliances they never
had before.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, officials also announced that they will build five
large hydroelectric power stations over the next 12 years, at a
cost exceeding $7 billion. Although some provinces have ample
electricity, hydroelectric power will allow planners to reduce
China's reliance on coal-fired stations.
</P>
<P>
   In the first eight months of the year, this spending for large
public projects rose 17.4 percent, to 894.3 billion yuan, or
$107.75 billion. In all of 1997, such spending increased by 10.1
percent, while the broad economy grew 8.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Zeng also pointed to a recent bond issue of 100 billion yuan as
a signal that Beijing is pursuing several avenues to increase
public spending.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why China has no plans to devalue the yuan, he said
the most important reason was that roughly half of exports required
imported parts. Therefore, a devaluation would have only a limited
effect on making Chinese exports more competitive in price.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign that China is seeking to maintain stable
exchange rates, the central bank ordered commercial banks to cut
interest rates on United States dollar deposits Wednesday. That
move will likely take pressure off the exchange rate by
discouraging demand for dollars. The yuan, which is only traded on
a limited basis, closed slightly higher, at 8.2784 to the dollar,
compared with 8.2788 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The reduction decreased one- and two-year fixed deposit rates by
five-eighths of a percentage point, making them 4.25 percent and
4.75 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials have also announced plans to crack down on
illegal currency trading, penalizing banks that violate
foreign-exchange regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Flooding in northeastern and central China this summer, which
caused more than $20 billion in damage and killed more than 3,000
people, will likely affect economic growth by 0.4 to 0.5 percent,
Zeng said.

   DEARBORN, Mich. _ Some Democrats around the country worry that
President Clinton's problems could affect the midterm elections,
but Michigan Democrats have an extra concern: Geoffrey Fieger,
their party's nominee for governor, whose background and language
have alienated many voters.
</P>
<P>
   For Rep. Sander Levin, an eight-term House member from an evenly
split district just outside of Detroit, the appearance of Vice
President Al Gore at a fund-raiser Wednesday morning was a hedge
against the possibility of flagging turnout in November.

   Fieger, the lawyer who represented Dr. Jack Kevorkian, the
champion of assisted suicide, is not expected to defeat Gov. John
Engler, a Republican who has led by as much as 2 to 1 in recent
statewide polls.
</P>
<P>
   But Levin, 67, whose brother, Carl, 63, represents Michigan in
the Senate, faces an aggressive challenge from Leslie Touma, a
former aide to Engler. By some predictions, the race is a tossup.
</P>
<P>
   The Levin fund-raiser was held in a home and was kept off limits
to reporters by Levin. About 55 people attended, aides to Gore
said, and the event raised about $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   Fieger was not scheduled to attend. Nor did he stay for a
lunchtime rally held here, where Gore gave state party leaders and
legislators a version of his standard get-out-the-vote speech, for
which they donated about $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the lunch, aides to Gore said Fieger had spoken
briefly with the vice president in a meeting they described as
``cordial'' and in which Fieger emphasized the need for the vice
president to support the entire state ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The aides also said Fieger's absence from events in which the
vice president was participating resulted from a scheduling
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it afforded Gore the convenient opportunity to tell the
party faithful that he would do what he could for ``the entire
ticket'' while not appearing with Fieger, who once called Jesus
Christ ``just some goofball that got nailed to the cross.''
</P>
<P>
   Fieger has steadfastly maintained that the remark referred to
what Jesus' crucifiers might have thought of someone who considered
himself the son of God. Yet no matter how it was meant or
interpreted, he has become a major factor for other Michigan
Democrats, and how voters respond to him could easily affect their
chances.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore declined to comment on Fieger, Rep. John D. Dingell,
who joined Gore at the rally, said neither Fieger's controversies
nor Clinton's would hold down Democratic turnout in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Dingell said Fieger ``will surprise you and I and a lot of
people'' and Clinton would not be ``a bit of a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing splendidly,'' Dingell said of the president, whose
favorable ratings have improved slightly since his videotaped grand
jury testimony was broadcast on Monday. ``And as you will observe,
he is not on the ticket this year.''

   DEARBORN, Mich. _ Some Democrats around the country worry that
President Clinton's problems could affect the midterm elections,
but Michigan Democrats have an extra concern: Geoffrey Fieger,
their party's nominee for governor, whose background and language
have alienated many voters.
</P>
<P>
   For Rep. Sander Levin, an eight-term House member from an evenly
split district just outside of Detroit, the appearance of Vice
President Al Gore at a fund-raiser Wednesday morning was a hedge
against the possibility of flagging turnout in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Democrats are turned off by Fieger,'' Abe Singer, a
lawyer from Detroit, said as he left the fund-raiser in Franklin, a
Detroit suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Fieger, the lawyer who represented Dr. Jack Kevorkian, the
champion of assisted suicide, is not expected to defeat Gov. John
Engler, a Republican who has led by as much as 2 to 1 in recent
statewide polls.
</P>
<P>
   But Levin, 67, whose brother, Carl, 63, represents Michigan in
the Senate, faces an aggressive challenge from Leslie Touma, a
former aide to Engler. By some predictions, the race is a tossup.

</P>
<P>
   Just before the lunch, aides to Gore said Fieger had spoken

MCDONALD'S HEIR GIVES $80 MILLION TO SALVATION ARMY 
</HEADLINE>
  (cb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Joan Kroc, widow of the man who turned McDonald's
into a billion-dollar corporation, donated $80 million to the San
Diego chapter of the Salvation Army on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The gift is the largest in the 133-year history of the
London-based organization, and represents more than double the San
Diego chapter's annual operating budget of $31 million. The money
will be used for construction and endowment of a community center
in an impoverished mid-city neighborhood of San Diego. The 12-acre
center will include a 500-seat theater, a college-size gymnasium, a
computerized library and research center, an ice skating rink, a
swimming pool and athletic fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed, we're humbled by it, we're grateful and we feel
honored that she has selected us to be able to reach out and help
people,'' said Donald C. Bell, a commander for the Salvation Army's
San Diego-area division.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Kroc, who died in 1984 at 82, bought out McDonald's in 1960
from its founders in San Bernardino, Calif., and turned the
hamburger restaurant into the ubiquitous international fast-food
chain.
</P>
<P>
   Kroc used to ring those familiar silver bells to solicit
Christmas donations for the Salvation Army's kettles on the streets
of San Diego, and financed many of the organization's Thanksgiving
and Christmas dinners for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Kroc also owned the San Diego Padres baseball team, which he
left to his wife when he died. She sold the team in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The center is expected to offer scholastic programs for children
before and after school hours and workshops in music, acting,
dance, mime and other performing arts, as well as child care,
nutrition for the elderly, family counseling and other social
services. Construction is to begin next spring, with the entire
center to open in 2000. The center will bear the names of Ray and
Joan Kroc.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kroc was ranked 36th among America's top philanthropists by
Fortune magazine this year, and is known as the ``Angel of Grand
Forks'' because of her donations of $15 million to flood victims in
North Dakota last year. Forbes magazine estimated her net worth at
$2.1 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In a groundbreaking ceremony Wednesday, Mrs. Kroc said she
wanted to do something for the neighborhood after touring it with a
former mayor and feeling troubled by what she saw. She recalled an
answer her husband had given after a friend asked why he was giving
away so much of his wealth: ``Well, I've never seen a Brinks truck
follow a hearse, have you?''

 &HT;    Ohio Republicans fear voter backlash
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton scandal could endanger some Republicans
in November.
</P>
<P>
   The national chairman of the Republican Congressional Campaign
Committee said Wednesday ``we're not the least bit concerned''
about voters retaliating against the GOP for being too unyielding
in dealing with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But one Capitol Hill aide, who asked not to be identified, said
GOP candidates do fear a backlash if an impeachment process is
begun and it seems to be driven by one party.
</P>
<P>
   Some Ohio Republicans agree their party could face a voter
backlash if sympathy for Clinton remains strong and party leaders
in Congress appear too eager to push him out of office against the
wishes of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``In purely political terms, sure there's a danger,'' said Gary
Abernathy, a spokesman for the Ohio Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   And the leader of the Ohio Democratic Party said that, since the
release of Clinton's video testimony, two registered Republicans
have called party headquarters saying their so angry with the GOP's
handling of the Clinton scandal they want to switch sides.
</P>
<P>
   One of those Republicans is Alice Beougher, a 66-year-old
innkeeper in Licking County, who said she spent her life in the
``right wing'' of the party as a member of the Concerned Women for
America, a Washington, D.C.-based public policy organization that
says it promotes Christian values and morality in family life.
</P>
<P>
   Beougher now has pledged to help elect Lee Fisher, Ohio's
Democratic nominee for governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a Republican anymore,'' she said Wednesday. ``It's all
a political thing, they're just after our president.''
</P>
<P>
   Beougher said she didn't vote for Clinton (``I'm sorry, I just
didn't''), and she dislikes the way Clinton behaved with Monica
Lewinsky in the Oval Office. ``I don't think it was right. But it
happened. The fact is that they were going to find something to
destroy this president.''
</P>
<P>
   Abernathy said the GOP has gotten similar phone calls from
disillusioned Democrats in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   John Green, a professor of political science at Akron
University's Ray C. Bliss Center of Applied Politics, said the
Republicans must be careful not to appear overzealous because ``Ken
Starr did seem to overdo it.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said it's too early to tell if a true backlash has begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really is peril,'' Green said. ``Initially it will be
against Ken Starr. The danger for the Republicans is if they appear
not judicious enough, not fair. I don't think we're there yet, but
it could well happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Political observers have generally agreed that Democrats would
be in jeopardy on Election Day _ six weeks away _ because their
membership would be too demoralized by the scandal to turn out and
vote.
</P>
<P>
   But Green said if the GOP overplays its hand against a
vulnerable and sympathetic president, ``it could energize the
Democrats.'

 &HT;    Residents rush to find a safe shelter
 &HT;    By Stephanie Desmon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Palm Beach County is one of the first
places to come in from the wind and rain of Hurricane Georges and
the area soon will have the full hotels and gridlocked highways to
prove it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has sold us out through the weekend,'' James Butler,
manager of the Holiday Inn Turnpike on Lake Worth Road, said
Wednesday. The story was the same at many hotels from Boca Raton to
Fort Pierce, and the phones were ringing at most others with
requests for any room, any room at all that might be left.
</P>
<P>
   In Palm Beach County, the storm isn't the biggest concern right
now, said Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center
in suburban Miami. It's the traffic, the kind of
bumper-to-bumper-to-bumper mess created if hundreds of thousands of
South Florida residents are evacuated from their homes and decide
to leave the region.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe County residents evacuated Wednesday morning and another
half-million Miami-Dade County residents could follow this morning,
putting many more cars on the same roads through Palm Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   It's already too late to flee, Jarrell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(People) should go as short a distance as they can and not try
to travel hundreds of miles,'' he said. ``If you live in reasonably
well-built homes, those are safe enough and you won't have any
trouble surviving this storm. It's a thousand times safer than
getting stuck in an automobile . . . because they're not built to
withstand the winds.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials are doing their best to ease traffic. For example, the
tolls on Florida's Turnpike have been suspended and rides are free
on the Sawgrass Expressway, Alligator Alley and other toll roads.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the entire toll system was suspended was for
Hurricane Andrew in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage to staying home: There may be no place to go.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel rooms in Orlando are going fast. The region has 91,000
rooms, second only to Las Vegas, but by 3 p.m. just 8,000 remained
for Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The accommodations business is also brisk on the Treasure Coast.
At the Holiday Inn Express in Fort Pierce near the Turnpike, rates
went from $69 to $79 after the hurricane threat appeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time of year is usually kind of slow, so it's great for
business but bad for their area,'' said manager Glen Hutchinson.
``We didn't feel it was right to price gouge, but we went up to our
rack rates for this time of year. It's a supply-and-demand type
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, transportation options have been limited.
</P>
<P>
   Train service will stop. Tri-Rail, the commuter train between
Miami and West Palm Beach, is closed today and possibly Friday. By
noon today, Amtrak passenger trains and CSX freight trains will
halt indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Workers will remove train crossing gates, which can become
projectiles in high wind, said CSX spokeswoman Jane Covington.
</P>
<P>
   As for planes, Palm Beach International Airport is unaffected so
far. Owners of small planes at Boca Raton's airport are being
advised to fly north, or to be tied down.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday morning, boaters began an exodus from coastal
marinas to calmer, protected inland waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fast and furious,'' said Anne E. Azar, co-owner of the
Bluffs Marina in Jupiter. ``I've got 40 some boats coming in the
next 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Boats and yachts from as far as Miami were looking for slips
throughout Palm Beach County. And fees at protected docks and
marinas were going up.
</P>
<P>
   The Bluffs is charging a minimum $500 for boats up to 50 feet
and $10 a foot over 500 feet. Azar said that charge allows boaters
top stay there three to four days until the storm passes.The normal
rate for dock space is $1.25 per foot, Azar said.
</P>
<P>
   Some were in a more giving mood. The Breakers in Palm Beach is
accepting guests, offering the five-star hotel's lowest rates _
$150 a night _ to Georges' victims. One caveat: They'd all have to
skip town if Georges forced the island's evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the refugees aren't welcome here, but . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not promoting it as a great destination right now for
anyone who is evacuating,'' said Gloria Calhoun, an emergency
spokeswoman for Palm Beach County. ``We want whatever's available
for our own people if and when (Palm Beach County is evacuated).''
</P>
<P>
   Staff writers Alexandra Navarro Clifton, Eliot Kleinberg, Teresa
Lane, Pat Moore, Jim Reeder and Christine Stapleton contributed to
this story.

 GREENSPAN RENEWS INVESTORS' HOPE FOR RATE CUT; MARKET SURGES  (jt) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Blue-chip stocks surged 3.26 percent Wednesday, as
federal Reserve officials hinted strongly at an interest-rate cut,
perhaps next Tuesday, to arrest a global economic skid that is
threatening to turn into a worldwide recession.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the market's gain came in the final hour of
trading, after Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, who disappointed
markets last week by saying no international plan for a coordinated
rate cut was being developed, renewed investors' hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deteriorating foreign economies and their spillover to
domestic markets have increased the possibility that the slowdown
in the growth of the American economy will be more than sufficient
to hold inflation in check,'' Greenspan told the Senate Budget
Committee. ``I think we know where we have to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,
William McDonough, made similar, though less pointed, comments
about risks to economic growth to reporters in London.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average raced 257.21 points, to close
at 8,154.41. The advance was the average's fifth-biggest point gain
on record, but it was not close to a record in percentage terms.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's advance above the 8,000 mark Wednesday put it at its
highest level since it plunged 512.61 points on Aug. 31. It had
peaked nearly 1,200 points higher on July 17, but most other stocks
had begun falling long before then.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks also powered to strong gains across Europe, with main
indexes up 3.82 percent in Germany and more than 2 percent in
Britain and France. Brazil's market, highly volatile of late,
soared nearly 11 percent on brightened prospects for aid, while
Mexican stocks jumped more than 9 percent. Japan's stock market was
closed for a holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the rally here was broadly based _ gainers swamped
losers among the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 by 420 to 14 _ financial,
oil and Internet-related stocks were particular standouts. Analysts
also pointed to what they said was a now clearly established
preference among many investors to look for bargains among smaller
companies
</P>
<P>
   ``They got washed out very hard,'' said Hank Herrmann, chief
investment officer at Waddell &AMP; Reed in Kansas City. ``People think
they are getting value here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq market, home to many small companies as well as some
dominant computer and software issues, rose 3.68 percent, better
than both the Dow and the S&AMP;P 500, which was up 3.54 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most startling leaps were by Internet stars
Amazon.com, up 16 15/16, and Yahoo, up 14 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet stocks really got going,'' said Andy Brooks, head
of stock trading at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore. ``Buyers are going
after stocks that can move'' after such a frustrating summer.
</P>
<P>
   Citicorp, with major foreign exposure that pushed its stock as
low as 83{ recently, rebounded 10], or 11 percent, to close at
105{, after the Justice Department and the Federal Reserve approved
its $46.4 billion merger with Travelers Group, removing the last
obstacle to the combination of a giant bank with a leading Wall
Street and insurance firm. Travelers rose 3|, or 9.2 percent, to
43.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Dwyer, chief market strategist at Ladenburg Thalmann, is
one of the biggest bulls on smaller stocks, citing their superior
rebounds from market declines. Using the Russell 2000 index as his
gauge, Dwyer calculated a 46.2 percent gain over the 6{ months
following recent bear markets, while the Dow climbed 37.9 percent
over about 11 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that the smaller cap stocks outperform
their larger brethren by close to 10 percentage points in a
significantly shorter period,'' he said. The market value of
Russell 2000 companies ranges from $40 million to $2.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The big oil stocks, though, posted handsome gains Wednesday, as
crude prices appeared to bounce solidly off their lows. Atlantic
Richfield rose 4], to 71], Mobil 4 5/16, to 79\, Chevron 3|, to 84
11/16, and Exxon 3\, to 70 5/16. Schlumberger, whose business is
oilfield services, climbed 3{, to 52~.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs were another strong blue-chip group, with Pfizer up 5
1/16, to 106{, and Warner Lambert up 35 /16, to 78 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Among banks, none reached Citibank's 10.9 percent gain but J.P.
Morgan added 5 1/16, to 93[, while Chase Manhattan jumped 4, to
50[.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered
decliners by 2,377 to 800, with 62 making new highs and 117 new
lows. Volume was 900.23 million shares.

 &HT;    Residents rush to purchase supplies and prepare for Hurricane
Georges
 &HT;    By Noah Bierman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Eleven-dollar pieces of plywood gained
new value Wednesday as local residents competed with Broward,
Miami-Dade and Monroe county residents to buy storm supplies.
</P>
<P>
   But most Palm Beach County and Treasure Coast residents remained
calm, figuring the brunt of Hurricane Georges wouldn't come this
far north.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really concerned, I just want to be ready,'' said Mike
Cundiff, a West Palm Beach resident who wheeled 30 jars of baby
food and ten gallons of water in his grocery cart at a West Palm
Beach Publix.
</P>
<P>
   Still, water, wood, batteries and flashlights were selling fast
as delivery trucks hustled to refill shelves. Space at animal
shelters was scarce. And electrical generators were not available
at all, most merchants said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stopped in West Palm Beach, but there was no plywood to be
found,'' Kendall resident Robert Hill said Wednesday afternoon as
he loaded a van with 25 sheets at Home Depot in Jensen Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now heading north to Fort Pierce to find a couple
generators,'' he said. ``They're out of them here.''
</P>
<P>
   Salesman Robert Brown said the Lake Worth Home Depot sold more
than 1,000 sheets of plywood in an hour and 15 minutes. When that
ran out, customers bought weaker waferboard for $10.75 or more
expensive wood siding for $19.80.
</P>
<P>
   Sales clerks limited customers to 15 sheets to keep people from
hoarding. For the same reason, store employees wouldn't say which
stores generators were being shipped to or from or whether any
would be available.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to protect people from scalpers and it's a tough
thing to do,'' said Kenny Nevad, who works in the hardware
department.
</P>
<P>
   Grocery store managers have not been limiting water sales,
though Scott Bates had a few questions for a group from Miami that
bought 15 cases of water Tuesday night. Bates said he was satisfied
they were bringing the scarce supply to friends and family and not
reselling it.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Mayhew, an investigator for the Florida Attorney General's
economic crimes office in Fort Lauderdale, spent Wednesday posting
notices at home-supply stores, supermarkets, police stations and
other locations in Palm Beach County. The notices reminded
potential gougers they faced civil fines of $1,000 per incident, up
to $25,000 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General Dan Stermer said he had already
received calls from across South Florida Wednesday but not from
Palm Beach County or the Treasure Coast. Most gouging occurs after
a storm, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Don Harrison, a spokesman for Home Depot's Southeast region,
said 125 truck drivers, each carrying 750 sheets of plywood, were
descending on South Florida. Although stores keep a seven-week
supply on hand, all of it disappeared Tuesday and Wednesday, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The company monitors the storm constantly, trying to keep
delivery ahead of its path. ``Like everyone else in South Florida,
we went to school and saw what happened during Hurricane Andrew,''
he said, referring to the 1992 storm.
</P>
<P>
   In Publix stores in Palm Beach County and across South Florida,
the hottest commodity is water, said Carmen Millares, community
affairs manager for the Miami division, which covers from Vero
Beach to Key West.
</P>
<P>
   The chain's Deerfield Beach center, the main water bottler for
the Miami division, is operating around the clock. She wouldn't
give production figures, citing competition concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Like many customers at the Publix on Southern Boulevard, Maxine
Browlee grabbed a few jugs from boxes marked ``storm stock, for
emergency use.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will need water regardless of the wind and the rain,'' said
Browlee, who survived two hurricanes in the '30s and '40s.
</P>
<P>
   Reservations from worried pet owners had already filled
veterinarian Ken Simmons hurricane-safe clinic in Greenacres by
Wednesday, Simmons said. Most of the owners were told to bring
their animals to the clinic sometime Thursday to avoid the worst of
the storm.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic will actually be more than full when all the animals
arrive, Simmons said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were boarding these animals for luxury vacations, we'd
be full right now,'' he said. But he's willing to keep some of the
animals in pet carriers and put several together in a cage _ with
the owners' permission _ to make more room for the short duration
of the storm.

HOME RUN RACE IS A SPRINT TO THE FINISH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Wis., Mo., N.Y.)  (mk) 
 By BILL DEDMAN     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ The summer of the home run is heading for a final
glorious weekend, an Indian summer involving Cardinals and Cubs.
Sammy Sosa hit two home runs Wednesday afternoon in Milwaukee,
tying Mark McGwire with 65 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   So the home run race, which many had thought was over, is a
sprint to the finish. Even Sosa had conceded the race to McGwire,
as Sosa went without a hit, much less a home run, for five days in
a row.
</P>
<P>
   But each time McGwire has pulled ahead, Chicago's Sosa has drawn
even. The players were tied at 55 home runs after 138 games, tied
at 62, tied at 63, and now at 65.
</P>
<P>
   A screenwriter planning the Hollywood version of the home run
race of 1998 will need a record-setting travel agent to witness the
magical ending. Fly to Houston? Sosa's Chicago Cubs will play three
games against the Astros, Friday through Sunday. Fly to St. Louis?
McGwire's Cardinals play four against the Montreal Expos, Thursday
through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's two blasts Wednesday at County Stadium in Milwaukee were
wasted when the Cubs lost a game that set a new record of
frustration for Cubs fans. A Cubs victory would have kept them at
least even with the Mets, who played later against Montreal, for
the last seat in the National League playoffs. After leading 7-0,
the Cubs lost, 8-7, when a young outfielder, Brant Brown, dropped a
fly ball that would have been the last out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it makes no difference if I finish first in home runs,
or if I finish last,'' Sosa said. ``I have another thing to think
about: the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second day in a row, a Cubs crowd welcomed Sosa in
Milwaukee. At least half of the 45,338 wore Cubs caps, shirts or
entire pinstriped uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Moore drove all night to be there, from Indianapolis to
Milwaukee. At age 57, he has yet to see the Cubs win a World
Series. Their last good chance was in 1969, when they collapsed
against the Mets. Moore spent the afternoon wandering the
bleachers, erasing the bitterness of a lifetime as a Cubs fan.
``And I'll hate the Mets until I die.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore nearly died in the fifth inning, when Sosa hit No. 64 to
right field off of Rafael Roque, the left-handed Brewer pitcher,
also from the Dominican Republic. And Moore couldn't stop yelling
in the sixth, when Sosa hit No. 65 to center off of Rod Henderson,
a relief pitcher. Both were fastballs, on the way in and out.
</P>
<P>
   But a century of resentment for Chicago Cubs fans came flying
into the late-afternoon shadows in the ninth inning, in the form of
a routine fly ball to left field. With two outs in the bottom of
the ninth, with the bases loaded in a 7-5 game, three runners were
circling the bases as the ball sliced toward the line.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Riggleman saw the ball. The manager of the Cubs was on the
top step of the dugout, ready to celebrate a victory that would
keep the Cubs at least even with the Mets for the last seat in the
National League playoffs. ``I don't take anything for granted,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And Brant Brown saw the ball. The left-fielder for the Cubs
glided back and over to the line, ready to squeeze the last out of
the game. Originally a first-baseman, he had worked for six years
in the minor leagues to learn the outfield. Wednesday he entered
the game in the eighth inning, as a defensive replacement. ``It was
a routine fly ball,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   As Cubs fans will remember until they die _ or erase from the
Bank of Resentments if the Cubs make the playoffs _ the ball
bounced off the heel of Brown's glove. It rolled away as three
Brewers scored. The Cubs lost a game they had led, 7-0. A new
standard of futility had been set for Cubs fans to remember until
they die _ or forget if the Cubs make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it doesn't cost us,'' Brown said, shaken and quiet in a
funereal Cubs clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   He made no excuses of the sun or the shadows. ``I'm the one who
has to live with it, who has to take responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Cubs go to Houston for their last three games against
the Astros on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The Mets, who played
Wednesday night against Montreal, will be in Atlanta against the
Braves.
</P>
<P>
   The manager of the Cubs, Jim Riggleman, warned his players that
he wouldn't brook any moping on the flight to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, `Hey, I love competing with you. You guys are
battling your tails off. We win as a team, we lose as a team. I
don't want to see anybody somber. You're playing in big ball games.
Let's just keep our heads up.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Sosa was similarly consoling. ``What happened to Brownie today
can happen to anybody who plays this game. We haven't given up.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa went home with one of his two home run balls. No. 65 hit
the empty center field area and bounced back onto the field.
Marquis Grissom, the Brewers center-fielder, put the ball in his
back pocket. Then he threw it to first-baseman Mark Loretta, who
put it in his pocket. After a while, he threw it to the Cubs dugout
to give to Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   No. 64 had been caught in the second row of the right-field
bleachers by Vernon Kuhlemeier, a 33-year-old Cubs fan from Dakota,
Ill. He said he intended to keep it, not sell it, after many years
without catching even a foul ball at Wrigley Field. The Cubs
offered him tickets to a game next year, and a chance to meet Sosa.
He countered with a request that Sosa sign the ball for him. It was
a standoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got 65,'' Sosa said, not too concerned about 64.
</P>
<P>
   And for the second day, the Cubs received a strong performance
from a starting pitcher. Tuesday it was Terry Mulholland.
Wednesday, Steve Trachsel pitched six scoreless innings, but was
marked with four runs in the seventh. The bullpen gave up another
run before closer Rod Beck came in to close it out in the ninth. He
got two outs, but gave up a single, double and intentional walk to
load the bases for Geoff Jenkins, the Brewer left-fielder.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was excruciating, Riggleman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so bad for Brant right now, because he's agonizing,''
Riggleman said. ``We're not in the position we're in right now,
competing for this wild card position, without Brant Brown. You get
that time of day, sometimes it's tough to catch a fly ball out
there. Brant's not making any excuses. He just missed the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Santo agrees. The third-baseman for the Cubs during the 1969
collapse, now a radio announcer, he left County Stadium with a sour
face and thoughts for Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about what happens to a young man,'' Santo said. ``He
has worked so hard. I just worry about how he reacts to this.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Sosa will be sorry that he can't take the
Milwaukee Brewers pitchers with him. He has hit 12 home runs in 10
games against the Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have to say, they're my lucky team,'' Sosa said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs luck is not so good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in God,'' Sosa said, ``and I believe in my
teammates. If it is for us, we're going to do it.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Residents rush to purchase supplies and prepare for Hurricane
Georges
 &HT;    By Noah Bierman

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Eleven-dollar pieces of plywood gained
new value Wednesday as local residents competed with Broward,
Miami-Dade and Monroe county residents to buy storm supplies.
</P>
<P>
   But most Palm Beach County and Treasure Coast residents remained
calm, figuring the brunt of Hurricane Georges wouldn't come this
far north.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really concerned, I just want to be ready,'' said Mike
Cundiff, a West Palm Beach resident who wheeled 30 jars of baby
food and ten gallons of water in his grocery cart at a West Palm
Beach Publix.
</P>
<P>
   Still, water, wood, batteries and flashlights were selling fast
as delivery trucks hustled to refill shelves. Space at animal
shelters was scarce. And electrical generators were not available
at all, most merchants said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stopped in West Palm Beach, but there was no plywood to be
found,'' Kendall resident Robert Hill said Wednesday afternoon as
he loaded a van with 25 sheets at Home Depot in Jensen Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now heading north to Fort Pierce to find a couple

expensive wood siding for $19.80.

 &HT;    Residents rush to find a safe shelter
 &HT;    By Stephanie Desmon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Palm Beach County is one of the first
places to come in from the wind and rain of Hurricane Georges and
the area soon will have the full hotels and gridlocked highways to
prove it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has sold us out through the weekend,'' James Butler,
manager of the Holiday Inn Turnpike on Lake Worth Road, said
Wednesday. The story was the same at many hotels from Boca Raton to
Fort Pierce, and the phones were ringing at most others with
requests for any room, any room at all that might be left.
</P>
<P>
   In Palm Beach County, the storm isn't the biggest concern right
now, said Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center
in suburban Miami. It's the traffic, the kind of
bumper-to-bumper-to-bumper mess created if hundreds of thousands of
South Florida residents are evacuated from their homes and decide
to leave the region.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe County residents evacuated Wednesday morning and another
half-million Miami-Dade County residents could follow this morning,
putting many more cars on the same roads through Palm Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   It's already too late to flee, Jarrell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(People) should go as short a distance as they can and not try
to travel hundreds of miles,'' he said. ``If you live in reasonably
well-built homes, those are safe enough and you won't have any
trouble surviving this storm. It's a thousand times safer than
getting stuck in an automobile . . . because they're not built to
withstand the winds.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials are doing their best to ease traffic. For example, the
tolls on Florida's Turnpike have been suspended and rides are free
on the Sawgrass Expressway, Alligator Alley and other toll roads.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the entire toll system was suspended was for
Hurricane Andrew in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage to staying home: There may be no place to go.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel rooms in Orlando are going fast. The region has 91,000
rooms, second only to Las Vegas, but by 3 p.m. just 8,000 remained
for Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The accommodations business is also brisk on the Treasure Coast.
At the Holiday Inn Express in Fort Pierce near the Turnpike, rates
went from $69 to $79 after the hurricane threat appeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time of year is usually kind of slow, so it's great for
business but bad for their area,'' said manager Glen Hutchinson.
``We didn't feel it was right to price gouge, but we went up to our
rack rates for this time of year. It's a supply-and-demand type
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, transportation options have been limited.
</P>
<P>
   Train service will stop. Tri-Rail, the commuter train between
Miami and West Palm Beach, is closed today and possibly Friday. By
noon today, Amtrak passenger trains and CSX freight trains will
halt indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Workers will remove train crossing gates, which can become
projectiles in high wind, said CSX spokeswoman Jane Covington.
</P>
<P>
   As for planes, Palm Beach International Airport is unaffected so
far. Owners of small planes at Boca Raton's airport are being
advised to fly north, or to be tied down.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday morning, boaters began an exodus from coastal
marinas to calmer, protected inland waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fast and furious,'' said Anne E. Azar, co-owner of the
Bluffs Marina in Jupiter. ``I've got 40 some boats coming in the
next 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Boats and yachts from as far as Miami were looking for slips
throughout Palm Beach County. And fees at protected docks and
marinas were going up.
</P>
<P>
   The Bluffs is charging a minimum $500 for boats up to 50 feet
and $10 a foot over 500 feet. Azar said that charge allows boaters
top stay there three to four days until the storm passes.The normal
rate for dock space is $1.25 per foot, Azar said.
</P>
<P>
   Some were in a more giving mood. The Breakers in Palm Beach is
accepting guests, offering the five-star hotel's lowest rates _
$150 a night _ to Georges' victims. One caveat: They'd all have to
skip town if Georges forced the island's evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the refugees aren't welcome here, but . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not promoting it as a great destination right now for
anyone who is evacuating,'' said Gloria Calhoun, an emergency
spokeswoman for Palm Beach County. ``We want whatever's available
for our own people if and when (Palm Beach County is evacuated).''

AS PLACEBO OR REAL CURE, FED RATE CUT SEEMS CLOSER 
</HEADLINE>
  (cb) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everybody seems to want the Federal Reserve policy makers to cut
interest rates when they meet Tuesday. And why not? With financial
chaos sweeping through Asia, Russia and now Latin America, a rate
cut would seem a smart inoculation against recession for the
domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
   That is certainly the view of the Business Roundtable, a group
of corporate leaders, as it vigorously lobbies for the Fed to cut
the cost of borrowing for American businesses. Lower rates would
also help individual debtors and foreign countries saddled with
loans that must be repaid in dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Alan Greenspan, in Congressional testimony on
Wednesday, encouraged investors to anticipate a small cut when he
noted that ``deteriorating foreign economies and their spillover to
domestic markets'' are slowing the economy and tilting the Fed's
concern from worrying about inflation to worrying about recession.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, true to their reputations as party poopers, many economists
side with Allan Meltzer, a professor of economics at Carnegie
Mellon University, who labels a rate cut premature.
</P>
<P>
   At most, a plausible case can be made for a middle ground _ a
small, therefore symbolic, cut next week that would not, unless
conditions drastically change, be followed by additional cuts.
</P>
<P>
   There is no compelling economic case yet for prolonged easing by
the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   The talk of a rate cut starts with the fact that a quarter of
the world's population is mired in recession or worse. Investors,
with a self-fulfilling fear that a country is about to devalue or
run out of reserves, flee with dollars that the country cannot
afford to cough up.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Japanese economy, the world's second largest, has
slipped into recession this year. Brazil, the ninth largest economy
in the world, flirts with its own financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The impact is already being felt in the United States. Exports
are dropping, as are commercial property prices, corporate profits,
housing starts and consumer confidence, a harbinger of consumer
spending. Major American banks and investment firms are announcing
big overseas losses, which might force them to retrench on domestic
as well as foreign lending.
</P>
<P>
   Rate cuts, say proponents, could mitigate these recessionary
shocks by encouraging consumers and businesses to spend more. Rate
cuts could also help nudge down interest rates abroad, easing the
burden on debtor countries and giving foreign investors reason to
believe that their investments are secure.
</P>
<P>
   But Meltzer of Carnegie Mellon says the economic blows to the
United States are ``little more than rumor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The groups that are screaming the loudest for rate cuts are
the ones that yelped for the Fed to keep its hands off the economy
when its chairman cautioned against irrational exuberance,'' he
said. ``In fact, the economy is strong and needs no help from the
Fed.''
</P>
<P>
   Meltzer points to the lowest unemployment rates in three
decades, brisk retail sales, and housing starts that, though they
dropped last month, remain about 16 percent above last year's
levels. Business investment is more than 15 percent above last
year's levels, and stock prices, though well off their summer
peaks, remain high by many measures.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Levy, chief economist at Nationsbanc Montgomery
Securities, said: ``Falling oil prices, interest rates and ample
growth of the money supply provide for healthy growth of the
economy. If the Fed eases anyway, it could create inflationary
pressures down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   What would persuade these economists to support rate cuts?
Concrete evidence that prices are falling or that bank reserves are
dipping to dangerous levels, threatening a credit crunch. Neither
is true. Wages, the primary component of prices, are rising at a 4
percent annual clip. And bank capital, according to David Hilder of
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, is substantial _ by his estimates about
30 percent above the levels recommended by regulators. Banks have
enough reserves to absorb substantial losses from investments in
Asia and other trouble spots without cutting off domestic
borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   Levy supplies another reason for the Fed to refrain from
repeated rate cuts. ``They solve no big problem and in places
abroad threaten to do more harm than good,'' he concludes. Rate
cuts cannot help Russia, whose problems are rooted in corrupt and
incompetent government policies, or Japan, whose banks are buried
in loans to bankrupt companies.
</P>
<P>
   The major problem abroad is psychological, argues Alan Blinder,
an economics professor at Princeton and a former vice chairman of
the Federal Reserve Board, who is an unapologetic liberal and a
self-proclaimed ``inflation dove.'' As an academic and Fed member,
he has consistently advocated looser monetary policies than most of
his colleagues deem prudent. Yet even he rejects calls for steep
rate cuts now. ``The United States is one of the few places on
earth that does not need a monetary boost now,'' Blinder said,
``and the Fed should divert its focus on the needs of foreign
economies only with the frequency of 50-year hurricanes.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Blinder makes a clever, if tentative, case for taking a
half step. The problem abroad, he says, is a ``crisis of confidence
that has one investor's fear feed on another's. It is plausible to
address a fear that is at its root psychological with symbolic
measures.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the Fed could _ ideally in cooperation with the
reluctant Germans _ cut rates by a small amount, say, a quarter or
perhaps even a half of a percentage point. Such amounts, he admits,
are too small to do much good but also too small to pose a serious
inflation threat if the economy remains strong. The act would send
a signal to investors that the Fed is prepared to step in as needed
to keep financial markets on an even keel. Blinder ponders no more
than a half step.
</P>
<P>
   The question then is whether the Fed, too, is contemplating a
rate cut to calm jittery investors or a prolonged strategy to ease
monetary policy.

 &HT;    Winning woes: Lottery player kidnapped, escapes
 &HT;    By Joshua B. Good
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Dwayne Bryant was lucky enough to win $5,100 playing
Georgia Lottory's Cash 3 game.
</P>
<P>
   Bragging about it brought him plenty of bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   Three gunmen kidnapped the 26-year-old from the front yard of
his southwest Atlanta home Sunday night. His mother-in-law, Lucille
Cook, watched the kidnappers force him into his 1976 Cutlass
Supreme and speed off. She called police.
</P>
<P>
   While Atlanta police officers were at the Bryants' home, the
gunmen called his wife, Sherrie Bryant. They told the mother of
three they would kill her husband if she didn't deliver the cash to
Grove Park at Bankhead Highway near West Lake Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnappers put Dwayne Bryant on the phone for a few seconds.
He told his wife to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of quickly handing over the cash, Sherrie, 28, conspired
with police to get her husband back. It was a gamble that paid off.
</P>
<P>
   While detectives drove up and down Bankhead Highway in unmarked
cars, the kidnappers called back. When Sherrie Bryant picked up the
phone, she pretended she was her mother because she was supposed to
be delivering the cash. She lied to the kidnappers and said she
needed better directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sherrie's over there right now. Where exactly is she supposed
to leave the money?'' she asked the kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
   The caller said he would kill her husband in 10 minutes if he
didn't get the money. By then Detective Jim Rose had spotted
Dwayne's empty Cutlass at the park. Rose made the decision to move
in just in time: one kidnapper's handgun was fitted with a laser
sight, and he taunted the 220-pound Dwayne Bryant, waving the red
dot across Dwayne's face as he talked about killing him.
</P>
<P>
   When the team of police pulled into the park, Bryant ran to
them. The empty-handed kidnappers ran in the opposite direction,
and eluded police.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant provided descriptions of his kidnappers, who were all in
their teens. Rose plans to interview the numerous friends Dwayne
had bragged to about his winnings.

SCANDAL RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT INFLUENCE OF LAWYERS ON SOCIETY

 By WILLIAM GLABERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the Watergate era, the misdeeds of lawyers
provoked a national discussion about whether ``legal ethics'' was
an oxymoron.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, President Clinton's troubles have ignited a new
and broader debate about the role of lawyers in American society.
But this time, the issue is not whether they broke the law but
whether lawyers and their way of thinking have become so pervasive
in America that legalistic gamesmanship is dominating politics _
and, perhaps, everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been this intrusion of the adversary process into life
as a whole,'' said Daniel Fischel, professor and dean-elect of the
University of Chicago Law School, ``and it colors everything: the
way people interact, what they say, their willingness to cooperate
with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Fischel said that the Lewinsky battle seemed to highlight a
growing worry about whether the lawyerly ideal of prevailing by
destroying the opposition had pushed aside other American values
like trust and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   In the Lewinsky investigation, legal definitions sometimes
prevail over common sense. Clinton's contortionist language, which
much of America saw in his videotaped grand jury testimony shown on
Monday, has come to be seen as the ultimate example of such legal
hairsplitting.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, for example, Clinton wondered aloud ``what the
meaning of the word `is' is,'' as he explained why he had not taken
issue with his lawyer's earlier comment that ``there is absolutely
no sex'' between the president and Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``If `is' means is and never has been, that is not _ that is one
thing,'' Clinton testified. ``If it means there is none,'' Clinton
continued, ``that was a completely true statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now if someone had asked me on that day, Are you having any
kind of sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky, that is, asked me a
question in the present tense, I would have said no. And it would
have been completely true.''
</P>
<P>
   His answer might have won praise in Trial Tactics 101. Instead,
it drew ridicule and added to the backlash that has been building
across the country against the use of legal fine points and
distinctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a perception increasingly shared by lay people, but
also by lawyers,'' said Anthony Kronman, the dean of Yale Law
School, ``that the gulf between the law and common sense has opened
up in this crisis to a considerable degree. And that has caused
people to lose confidence in the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a former Arkansas attorney general who has always
seemed drawn by legal distinctions, drew rebukes even from senior
members of his own party for asserting that his responses regarding
the definition of sexual relations agreed upon in the Paula Jones
lawsuit were ``legally accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The president and his advisers are going to have to accept
that continued legal jousting serves no constructive purpose,''
said Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Senate minority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, said,
``The considered judgment of the American people is not going to
rise or fall on the fine distinctions of a legal argument.''
</P>
<P>
   But the concern that legalisms are leading the country out the
door of ordinary logic has hardly been limited to the White House.
Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, has also been
fighting off accusations that his investigation was little more
than a lawyer's artificial construct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to answer your trick questions,'' Clinton said
to one of Starr's prosecutors who questioned him before the grand
jury.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's critics call his investigation a mere perjury trap,
which they say existed solely to impale the president on his own
legalisms. Without the Starr inquiry into whether Clinton lied in a
deposition in a civil suit that was later dismissed, the critics
say, there would be no question of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Starr's critics say one explanation for the president's
continuing strong showing in polls may be that Americans view the
Starr assertions, Clinton's defenses and virtually everything else
about the battle in Washington as legal skirmishes that have little
to do with real life.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's report to Congress included scores of examples of such
lawyerly logic. In great detail, for example, the report described
lies Clinton told top aides like John Podesta, the deputy chief of
staff. Lawyers say Starr was inventive in his assertion that
Clinton violated the law by telling lies to his own staff members
in private meetings. Starr argued in his report that Clinton's lies
to his staff, knowing all the while they might be called to testify
about his denials, amounted to obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   David Leebron, the dean of Columbia Law School, said both the
president and the independent counsel are reinforcing a stereotype
of lawyers and their reasoning that is detached from reality.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The public perception is that the visible lawyers on both
sides _ including the president _ are not reassuring about the use
of law in pursuing justice in our country,'' Leebron said. ``On the
side of Ken Starr, many people have come to feel, it is legal
procedure run amok _ the use of legal tools totally without
discretion and judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   In their televised questioning of the president, Starr's
prosecutors often seemed unable to resist lawyerly pursuit of the
obvious. They defined ``phone sex'' in their questions and framed
inquiries such as ``if there is a semen stain belonging to you on a
dress of Ms. Lewinsky's, how would you explain that?''
</P>
<P>
   As the details have come spilling out, it seems that everyone,
even Ms. Lewinsky, who is not a lawyer but knows plenty of them,
was addicted to legal distinctions.
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Lewinsky's case, Vernon Jordan, the president's friend
who was helping her get a job, asked her if she and the president
had had an affair, Starr's report said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, now yet 25, saw the question as just another legal
maneuver, the Starr report concluded. She answered no because,
prosecutors concluded, she ``interpreted Jordan's questions as,
'What are you going to say?' rather than what are the answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Long before the Lewinsky case, there had been a growing concern
even among some legal scholars about the intrusion of too much
lawyering in America, voiced through books, seminars, cartoons and
general handwringing. The events of recent weeks have catapulted
those concerns, among some of the nation's most influential legal
educators, to new levels.
</P>
<P>
   One legacy of the Lewinsky era is sure to be a re-examination of
the influence of lawyers on the country, said Ronald Cass, the dean
of Boston University School of Law. ``The question,'' Cass said,
``will be whether lawyers are serving any real purpose in life or
whether lawyers are simply engaging in semantic arguments that
don't make sense to ordinary people.''
</P>
<P>
   That debate, said Derek Bok, a former Harvard Law School dean
and former president of Harvard University, ``is very much a
reflection of our culture; we believe in competition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People like the competition,'' said Bok, ``but they want a
kind of wise restraint that is probably asking too much of human
nature.''

BRAZIL'S LEADER CALLS FOR REFORMS, HEARTENING INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (cb) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO _ In a move to counter international uncertainty
about his government's answer to growing deficits, the Brazilian
president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, opened the door on Wednesday
to raising taxes if he is re-elected, and vowed to push through
Congressional votes on restructuring social security and the civil
service.
</P>
<P>
   Though Cardoso is leagues ahead of his nearest rival, the
speech, less than two weeks before national elections, was welcomed
as a bold political step. To international investors, it signaled
that Brazil would be prepared to work with the International
Monetary Fund to match aid with serious progress in reducing its
budget deficit, which is running at more than 7 percent of the
gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   Banking on his lead in the polls, Cardoso appeared to be bracing
voters for difficult measures ahead. Those who had already decided
to vote for Cardoso supported even his announcement of tax
increases, while some who planned to vote against him dismissed his
speech as demagoguery. The stock market rose 10.98 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The reforms, if successful, would go far toward easing Brazil's
swelling budget and trade deficits, and would send tremors through
the elaborate fabric of guaranteed benefits _ especially for civil
servants _ enshrined in the 1988 Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Saying it was up to government to learn to live within its means
``once and for all,'' Cardoso raised the prospect of legally
forcing federal, state and local governments to balance their
books, and he committed his future government to a program of tough
fiscal adjustment over the next three years that would prevent the
public debt from growing faster than the gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   Though the government in the past has waffled on whether or not
it was negotiating some form of aid with the International Monetary
Fund, Cardoso said Wednesday that Brazil ``does not and will not
fear discussing our adjustments with openness in relation to the
rest of the world.'' This, he said, included ``intense dialogue''
with the IMF and other international lenders.
</P>
<P>
   He vowed that the government would crack down on tax evasion
and, if that failed to raise revenues, would increase taxes. Of the
estimated 73 million Brazilians in the work force, only 7.6 million
pay income tax, according to government figures. Brazil, like many
other developing countries, relies instead on taxing services and
products to produce revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Cardoso met with the leaders of the House and the
Senate, who agreed to press for votes on government reforms after
the elections. Wednesday, Michel Temer, president of the House,
praised Cardoso's speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``He acted as the president should,'' Temer said. ``He wanted to
warn the nation, and not be deceitful.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Emir Sader, a sociology professor at the University of Sao Paulo
and the State University of Rio de Janeiro, described the speech as
``vote now, pay later,'' and said that Cardoso's difficulties lay
not in winning support from the opposition in Congress, but from
his allies within the conservative Liberal Front Party. ``His
problems are with the alliances that he's made,'' Sader said.
</P>
<P>
   Though announcing his plans made them instant fodder for his
rivals, Cardoso remains comfortably ahead in voter opinion surveys,
and is expected to win re-election in the first round of voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that it's unnecessary to cut spending,'' said Ciro
Gomes, a former Finance Minister who is running third in the race
for president, ``but Fernando Henrique, who commandeered the
country's largest deficit ever, does not have the moral authority
to ask for states and municipalities to cut expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   In declaring his own intentions, however, Cardoso did not appear
to alter those of voters.
</P>
<P>
   Franciso Bezerra, 33, said he did not plan to vote for Cardoso
before or after the speech, though he agreed with some of the
measures. ``Reforming social security is cutting privileges, but
the government is only putting a band-aid on the problem,'' said
Bezerra. ``The speech was just more demagoguery, because he knows
he's already re-elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Mendonca, 65, who gets up at 5 each morning to reach
his job selling snacks at a beachside kiosk each day, praised the
president. ``He has to take serious measures,'' Mendonca said.
``He's doing the right thing, and if its affects my pockets, it's
worth the sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso said he would send Congress the bill to reform the
social security system in October. If it passes, the bill is likely
to be the single most significant step toward correcting the budget
deficit, and stemming a disproportionate drain on the pension
system by public sector workers. While civil servants retire at
full salary, payments to private-sector workers cannot exceed
$1,100 a month. The social security deficit is expected to total
$24 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   Amaury de Souza, a consultant with Techne Technology and Human
Resources, called the speech ``courageous.'' He noted that social
security costs at the state and federal level were so out of hand
that they accounted for nearly 50 percent of payroll costs. ``It
means we can't pay decent wages to active civil servants,'' de
Souza said. ``This is the worst threat that we have to the public
payroll, and this is a constitutional threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street, too, was pleased. James W. Barrineau, an equity
strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, said that Cardoso's speech
``hit all the right notes.'' Investors were expecting that
industrial nations would draw a line in the sand to protect Brazil,
with a contingency fund that could range from $20 billion to $50
billion, but they had doubted the government's willingness to do
the necessary fiscal belt-tightening.
</P>
<P>
   The president's speech, he said, had ``heartened the markets.''

<P>
   SEATTLE _ There are other things to talk about, Dori Monson, the
host of a popular talk-radio program on KIRO-AM in Seattle, told
his listeners the other day. There is a big tobacco lawsuit going
on in Washington state. There is the controversial case of a
Seattle lad who, under a ``zero tolerance'' policy, was kicked out
of school the other day for carrying a water pistol to class.
</P>
<P>
   But no, Monson said. ``We'll probably do Clinton for another
three hours. And we can. We're the media!''
</P>
<P>
   And with that, the talk-show host indeed launched into another
program that wound up focusing almost exclusively on the president
and Monica Lewinsky. And that is clearly what all his callers
wanted to talk about, from Steve in Bremerton (``the biggest
blunder the Republicans have ever done to themselves,'' said Steve,
himself a Republican, of the decision to release the president's
taped testimony) to Darlene, a caller from Tacoma, who said the
whole matter seemed to be playing out like an episode of ``The
Jerry Springer Show.'' Not true, protested Monson: no slap fights
yet.
</P>
<P>
   Good point, Darlene conceded, adding, ``And at least on Jerry
Springer, they bleep out all the nasty words.''
</P>
<P>
   A sampling of similar radio shows in other cities around the
United States indicates that the Clinton-Lewinsky affair is the
dominant _ and on many, the exclusive _ topic these days, and many
of the programs' hosts say there is no sign of a let-up in
interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing's a bonanza for political talk radio, which
had been going through a very dry period after the 1996 election,''
said Michael Harrison, editor of Talkers, a trade publication that
covers the talk-radio industry. ``After the election,
Clinton-bashing on talk radio became boring, even to his critics.
Even to Clinton haters, it had lost its pizazz. Well, the Lewinsky
stuff changed all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as important for the industry, Harrison added, the mystery
and controversy surrounding the president's relationship with the
White House intern allowed hosts to start talking about the very
things that many political shows had been accused of lacking:
``sex, lifestyles, gender relations.'' Harrison added, ``It turned
politics into what we in talk radio call water-cooler
conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   True to the reputation of talk shows as a forum more popular
with conservatives and Republicans than with liberals and
Democrats, many of the callers spoke in terms strongly hostile to
the president.
</P>
<P>
   But a subtheme that has emerged in the shows this week is a
pained admission within anti-Clinton circles that the release of
the president's testimony may have helped him politically, and with
it, a vigorous discussion of how Clinton's critics can regain the
initiative in their quest to drive him from office.
</P>
<P>
   And so we hear from Ronny in Houston: ``I think we need a new
cliche _ `It's perjury, stupid.''' Or Kevin in Boston, calling from
his car phone: ``This guy is playing us like a cheap fiddle. This
guy makes P.T. Barnum look like an amateur.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Rush Limbaugh, the top conservative talk-show host in the
country, seemed grudgingly impressed. ``Four hours on how to stay
out of jail,'' he said of the president's testimony. Now, he
bemoaned to his listeners on Tuesday, the Republican Congress is
faced with ``having to impeach a president who looked good _ really
good.''
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, several callers who said they generally voted
Republican said they were so disgusted by what they saw as party
leaders' harping on Clinton that they were considering voting for
Democrats this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a backlash setting in against Ken Starr and the
Republicans,'' said Ken, a caller in Seattle. ``They just are not
leaving this thing alone.'' Next up was another Seattleite, Jim, on
a cell phone. ``I'm just shocked that the Republicans gave him that
forum to speak and basically repair a lot of his image,'' said Jim,
referring to release of the videotape.
</P>
<P>
   Jim added, ``I was very saddened to see how good he looked on
the video and I think it changed a lot of people's opinions,
unfortunately.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Anti-Clinton callers across the country were having a hard time
understanding why the country at large was not more outraged. David
Brudnoy, host of the program Kevin called into on WBZ radio in
Boston, tried to get a discussion going on why the president's
job-approval ratings remained so high in public-opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're saying we think Clinton's a scummy individual, but
we love him as president, that I think is a new thing in America,''
said Brudnoy. ``I've never heard of such a thing in any previous
presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, Cornell, an immigrant from Romania, called in to
say that ``it's not a big deal what happens behind closed doors''
and that Romanians simply could not fathom a government
investigation into one's sex life.
</P>
<P>
   Calls from anyone defending the president often draw scorn from
the hosts, and indeed, Cornell's comments provoked a sarcastic
response from the host of the Los Angeles program, Marc Germain,
who goes by the moniker ``Mr. KABC.'' ``Oh, like Romania's form of
rule is far superior to the United States,'' shot back Germain.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset of his program on Tuesday, Germain said that he
wanted to hear the views of people raised in other countries,
because he said he was interested in reports that foreigners were
generally unfazed by the president's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for immigrants,'' Germain told listeners. ``The
thicker the accent, the more chance you have of getting through the
screener.''
</P>
<P>
   Monson, host of the Seattle program, who jokes that KIRO now
stands for ``Klinton Information Radio Organization,'' said that
even when he has held an ``open-mike Friday,'' when callers are
urged to bring up any topic on their minds, the saga of Clinton and
Ms. Lewinsky still dominates. And even the people who call up to
say that too much time is being spent on the matter generally
cannot resist offering their opinions about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just got it all,'' said Monson. ``It's the traditional
allure of politics and power and sex. All the elements of great
soap opera are present, and people just cannot get enough of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison, the editor of Talkers magazine, publishes a regular
list of the ``Top 10'' topics being discussed on programs around
the nation. But, he said of the inquiry into sex and possible lies
at the White House, ``It's so at the top of the Top 10 that it
causes us trouble figuring out how to list anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   For his October edition, Harrison said, he has hit upon a
solution: He'll now include the top 10 subtopics within the overall
topic of the Lewinsky affair: for instance, he said, the
impeachment question, the legal issues, the political issues, the
moral issues, ``pure gossip and titillation,'' and jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since he started running for president, Clinton has
inspired a visceral dislike in some Americans, a phenomenon that at
least some experts have traced to a surge in popularity for talk
radio programs, many of which largely consist of hosts and callers
taking turns talking about how awful the president is.
</P>
<P>
   But after the 1996 election, Harrison said, there was a slow but
discernible decline in ratings, indicating in part that so-called
``Clinton-bashing'' was on a ``statistical downward slope'' as
measured by ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewinsky matter, he said, quickly halted the fall-off.
``What's happened is, it put the brakes on the decline of political
talk radio,'' he said. ``Whether it's temporary, we don't know.''

   STAMFORD, Conn. _ Bob Dole takes care to assure audiences that
he is not on ``an `I told you so' tour.'' But there is at least a
mild sense of vindication in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Publishing and political calendars have aligned to give the
former Senate majority leader a heavy speaking schedule at the
moment that his opponent of two years ago, President Clinton, is
caught in the worst political crisis in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's have one more shot at it _ go out and run one more time,
both of us, in January,'' Dole told his audience Wednesday at a
book-signing here. He admits that Clinton is not likely to accept
the challenge. ``I haven't ordered any buttons,'' Dole said.
</P>
<P>
   Charging into his scandal patter, he noted that his apartment at
the Watergate is just a few doors from that of Monica Lewinsky. ``I
walk by very fast,'' he said, to applause.
</P>
<P>
   All the questions about the president leave Dole little time to
plug his new book of political humor or the Republican candidates
he is appearing with, but he seems to be relishing the spotlight's
return. Earlier this week, it was the Don Imus radio show. On
Thursday, he is scheduled for the ``Today'' show. Wednesday, he was
signing books at the Westin Hotel, where 300 customers of Just
Books, in Greenwich, Conn., paid $26 each for a plate of tandoori
chicken and a question-and-answer session with Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, 75, had tough words for both parties' behavior since the
delivery of the report from Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater
independent counsel. ``I want to say to my Republican colleagues:
Don't try to overplay your hand. Don't try to outsmart
yourselves,'' Dole said. ``I think they're losing the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he said of White House officials, ``If you're ever going
to broker something, you're going to have to get these attack dogs
to back off the airwaves. They have to back away from that
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the sharpest of several jabs at Clinton, Dole complained
about accusations that Republicans are dragging out the response to
Starr's findings. ``Remember who kept us from dealing with it
earlier,'' Dole said. ``It's President Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Devotees of Dole-speak would not be surprised by his rendering
of the title of his book, which reached bookstores last week.
```Laughing (Almost) All the Way to the White House' _ `Great
Political Wit' _ whatever,'' he said after popping into a corporate
seminar being held in the same hotel. He was close. He had simply
reversed the book's title and subtitle.
</P>
<P>
   These days a public appearance for Dole still means a black
Lincoln Town Car, a holding room, velvet ropes and young men
whispering into walkie-talkies. He still refers to The Hill, a
Capitol Hill newspaper, as ``the local paper.'' Women snap photos,
and military veterans say they have waited all their lives to meet
him.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, the stage is much smaller. ``I watch C-Span,'' he
said. ``Like anybody who's retired, you miss your job. I wonder how
they can run without me, but it seems like every day, they're
meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole is often asked to handicap the chances that his wife,
Elizabeth Dole, will enter the 2000 presidential race. Dole joshes
that she won't tell him, but he keeps listening for hints. ``I told
her, `Elizabeth, all I want's a car and a driver,''' he said. ``I
want a beeper, in case I'm left behind at some big function.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole lingered to greet fans from the book luncheon, then headed
off for a fund-raising reception in Greenwich for Mark Nielsen, a
34-year-old Connecticut state senator who is seeking to oust Rep.
Jim Maloney in the Fifth District. Nielsen, who introduced Dole as
``a living reminder that character counts,'' is one of two dozen
Republican candidates Dole is scheduled to stump for over the next
six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   After Dole's quip-a-minute afternoon, he reverted to his
trademark disjointed style while discussing the separation between
officials' public and private lives. ``You read what Disraeli had
to say,'' he said, then paused. ``I don't remember what he said. He
said something. He's no longer with us.''

GINGRICH SAYS PROBE OF CLINTON SCANDAL MUST RUN ITS COURSE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Speaker Newt Gingrich on Wednesday quashed
calls for a quick deal with President Clinton over the Lewinsky
matter amid Democratic charges that the impeachment process was
being prolonged for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Republican dismissed proposals floated by the White
House and some Democrats that Clinton might agree to be censured
and fined after a brief inquiry in which the president would
testify before a congressional committee about his affair with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for anybody to talk about doing anything until we
finish the investigative process simply puts the cart before the
horse,'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich made the comments after a meeting with House Minority
Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., and the top Democrat and Republican
on the House Judiciary Committee to resolve growing partisan
tensions in dealing with independent counsel Kenneth Starr's
report.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has charged that Clinton may be guilty of a variety of
offenses, including perjury and obstruction of justice, in regard
to his testimony about the affair in court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   But it was clear that the meeting of congressional leaders did
little to resolve their differences, as representatives from both
parties spent the day holding dueling news conferences to denounce
the other side.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt called on congressional Republicans to set a timetable
of about 30 days to deal with Starr's report, determine whether
Clinton is guilty of impeachable offenses and decide punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said there was no reason to stretch out the hearings
for months and subject the nation to more of the salacious details
that have come out over the past few weeks regarding the
president's affair with the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the sake of the country and in the interest of limiting
the exposure of our children to this kind of detail in an
atmosphere of wall-to-wall media coverage, this needs to be dealt
with with due process and justice and also deliberate speed,''
Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt also pressed Starr to release about 20 boxes of
material relating to his investigation that he has not turned over
to the House, documents that Democrats suspect may support Clinton.
Among the materials still held by Starr are the testimonies of
Lewinsky's father, Bernard Lewinsky, and White House aide Sidney
Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt also said Democrats oppose widening the impeachment
probe, as suggested by some Republicans, to include issues such as
campaign finance abuses by the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said that Starr's report should not ``set up a fishing
expedition.''
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.,
rejected any time line for finishing the probe, arguing against
``artificial deadlines which only invite stalling tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The president had eight months to tell the truth, but instead
he sent his staff out to declare his innocence to the world. Now
the Democrats want us to shut down an inquiry of his behavior in 30
days,'' Hyde said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde later said he would not rule out expanding the impeachment
inquiry to other matters but added that ``we have enough on our
platter.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans on the Judiciary Committee are bracing
for more fights Friday as they resume poring over 16 boxes of
documents from Starr's office that must be released by Monday
unless committee members deem them unsuitable for public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have complained that Republicans unnecessarily
released salacious material just to embarrass the president.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have argued that the House voted overwhelmingly to
release all of the material sent over by Starr. However, the House
gave the Judiciary Committee the power to delete passages deemed
offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich charged that Democrats on the committee were trying to
prevent the public from viewing the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most anti-openness group in the House,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have responded that if Republicans were truly
interested in openness the Judiciary Committee would not be holding
its meetings behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats believe Republican resistance to expediting the
impeachment proceedings is directly related to the this November's
elections. Some Republicans have boasted that they hope to
capitalize on the scandal, which polls indicate motivates their
base of conservative voters and demoralizes Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spokesman Mike McCurry said some Republicans might be
open to working out a deal with Clinton but do not want to alienate
what he called the ``jihad caucus'' of their party, which is
clamoring for the president's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who has been floating the
idea of a deal on Capitol Hill, warned that Republicans could face
a backlash at the polls if voters think they are prolonging the
probe for political gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``They risk making this the government shutdown issue of 1998,''
Kerry said, referring to the Republican decision in 1995 to shut
down the government because of a budget dispute with Clinton.
Voters blamed the Republicans for the shutdown, which helped
Clinton portray his opponents as insensitive.
</P>
<P>
   Two former presidents weighed in this week on Clinton's
troubles. Speaking to Emory University students, former President
Carter said in Atlanta that he didn't believe Clinton told the
truth in his grand jury testimony. Carter also said he expected the
House to vote to impeach the president but that the Senate would
not uphold it.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said he ``deplored and has been deeply embarrassed'' by
the president's behavior. But he added, ``I have also been
embarrassed by the reaction to it, the overemphasis of it, the
matter in which a very serious political legal issue has been
addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Former President Bush in a taped interview with NBC-TV's
``Today'' show was reluctant to criticize or second-guess Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got enough critics out there now,'' Bush said. When asked
how the office of the president has been affected, Bush responded,
``the office is strong, bigger than any one person. But I'm afraid
for now it has been diminished.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the shadow of President Nelson Mandela's visit
to the Capitol, the word ``forgiveness'' was being uttered most
gingerly Wednesday, as if it were the latest in the endless string
of lurid notions that has been resounding daily in the
sex-and-mendacity investigation of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forgiveness is what Mandela is all about,'' said Rep. Amo
Houghton, a New York Republican, grinning at the very word in the
context of the Capitol's partisan seething over impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean this guy Mandela comes out of prison after 27 years,
and the first thing he does is forgive his jailers!'' said
Houghton, who led the drive to award Mandela the Congressional Gold
Medal, given him at a Rotunda ceremony Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine the fortuitous stars coming together for us at
a time like this?'' the congressman asked in the crowd after the
ceremony. ``Really: our nation, doubting itself, driving itself
into different camps, and all of a sudden the great conciliator of
our time coming here and saying what he did and just being with
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Forgiveness?
</P>
<P>
   Out beyond the exultant gathering, Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga.,
dedicated earliest and most deeply to the impeachment drive, orated
from a television interview perch as if it were a rampart,
repeating his call for the end of Clinton as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, you do remember, don't you, Betty, that I was never, ever
alone in this office,'' Barr declared in acid parody of Clinton's
anxious chats with his secretary, Betty Currie. ``You do remember
that, don't you?''
</P>
<P>
   Forgiveness?
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, we've been looking down as a nation, and if there
were today a Dante writing `The Inferno,' we would be on the
lowest, the seventh level,'' said Rep. Donald Payne, yearning for
the Mandela spirit to waft through Capitol corridors so iron-hard
with party enmities. ``But Mandela brought us back up to being out
of `The Inferno.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Payne, a New Jersey Democrat, thought for a moment. ``Well, at
least for this day,'' he amended most warily.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich, too, recognized that Mandela's visit was
an occasion apart from politics _ from the ``very rough-and-tumble
business involving at times great personal pain,'' he noted at the
Rotunda ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela sat between Gingrich and Clinton, and the gathering of
politicians carefully watched for body language between the
nation's two chief political antagonists. One Clintonite later
complained that Gingrich had seemed to offer the president a cold
shoulder amid the ceremonial display of bipartisan elation.
</P>
<P>
   As far as presidents go, Gingrich preferred to acknowledge the
various Rotunda depictions of George Washington looking down on the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are rare moments in a country's history when it is
defined by a personality,'' he said, speaking of political legacy,
an obssessive topic for Clinton. ``When it resonates and changes in
a way that for generations are imprinted on child after child, in
speech after speech, in lesson after lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   Forgiveness? After the ceremony, Gingrich held a news conference
and quickly snuffed Democrats' hopes of having the Lewinsky matter
disposed of within a mere month or two. ``I don't understand how
people can rush to a solution before they finish the
investigation,'' he said, warning against any ``grotesque''
slavering by lawmakers over Clinton's strong job-approval ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony included a beaming, unscripted intrusion by Strom
Thurmond, the Senate ancient who arrived here more than four
decades ago as a segregationist Democrat and survives as a
95-year-old integrationist Republican. He toddled forward and held
up Mandela's hand, as if the destroyer of apartheid was the greater
champ in the planet's crusade against racism. A kind of forgiveness
seemed in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Nelson Mandela can forgive the people who abused him, then
we should find it in our hearts as citizens of this country to
forgive, to reconcile,'' said Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., a Clinton
supporter _ and a forgiver watching the scene. ``There needs to be
this unbelievable national taking of a deep breath that it's over.
But, of course, we're not there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   As if speaking personally, Clinton thanked Mandela for ``the
inspiration you have given us to do better.'' The South African
bolstered Clinton in advising him at a reception on Tuesday night
that ``the greatest glory of living lies not in never falling but
in rising every time you fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday Mandela exuded a quiet joy that transcended the
Capitol hubbub about impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like the heavyweight boxing champion of the world,'' he
said with a smile, even as his audience dwelt more on his talent as
a referee of national reconciliation.

ALBRIGHT AND NETANYAHU REPORT PROGRESS TOWARD TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel reported some progress
here Wednesday toward ending the stalemate in peace talks between
Israel and the Palestinians. But they agreed that a settlement was
still not imminent.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said after the meeting that Israel and the
Palestinians were inching toward a settlement under which Israel
would withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank, with about
one-quarter of that land designated as a nature reserve to prevent
Palestinian settlements there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of work to do,'' Albright said. ``We have made
some progress. We are taking it one step at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked by reporters whether she was optimistic about the
negotiations, she replied, ``I'm an eternal optimist.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright is expected to see the Palestinian leader, Yasser
Arafat, when he arrives in New York in a few days to attend the
General Assembly, which brought Albright and Netanyahu to the city.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Albright said she was quite likely to meet again here
with Netanyahu, and the State Department held out the possibility
that she would play host to a meeting next week with both the
Israeli and the Palestinian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secretary Albright is obviously going to try to spend what
reasonable time she can this week, through the weekend, in trying
to advance the peace process that has been stalled for so long,''
her chief spokesman, James Rubin, said. ``What we're trying to do
is lock in the progress on the important principles that we need to
get agreement on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One does often sense that the closer one gets'' to a
settlement between Israel and the Palestinians, Rubin said, ``the
more each of them steps back. ``But we're nonetheless determined to
do what we can to be as creative as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, who has at times had a prickly relationship with
Albright, said at a separate news conference the two were largely
in agreement on the outline of a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately this doesn't depend only on Israel and the
United States,'' he said. ``If it were just the two of us I think
we'd make a lot of progress. But as you know, there's a third party
involved, the Palestinian Authority, and they have to show, to
demonstrate clearly, that they will live up to their obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   Designating part of the land as nature reserves, diplomats said,
should satisfy the Palestinians, because that would require the
Israelis to leave, and should satisfy the Israelis because the
Palestinians would be barred from building on it, at least for a
number of years.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu stressed, however, that Israel would demand guarantees
that the land turned over to the Palestinians would not be used as
a base for terrorism. Israel is seeking to retain security control
over the land.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We hope the Palestinians will understand that if they want
Israel to cede additional territory _ this is very difficult for us
to do, but we're prepared to do it _ they must carry out all their
responsibilities and to promise chiefly to ensure that those
territories don't become a base in the region for terrorists,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said they were working behind the scenes to
prevent Arafat from using his scheduled address next week to the
General Assembly to hint at plans for the declaration of a
Palestinian state, a move that would outrage Israel.

 NEW YORK: fourth term.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But D'Amato and his campaign _ while contributing to what has
become a daily stream of invective on paper and on television from
both candidates _ declined to comment on the first lady's remarks.
Instead, D'Amato's press secretary, Harvey Valentine, offered a
list of testimonials from women to D'Amato, including one from
Susan Molinari, the former Republican representative from Staten
Island, and assailed Schumer for attacking D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck Schumer has given up all pretense of running a campaign
on issues,'' said Valentine, reading from a prepared statement.
``It's said that he's decided to go completely negative.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine declined to go beyond the prepared remarks.
</P>
<P>
   The visit by Mrs. Clinton provided Schumer a chance to win both
attention and money; his aides said he raised $250,000 at the
fund-raiser at Tatou, a converted 1920s opera house where Desi
Arnez used to perform. But most important, it allowed Schumer, with
an extraordinary large assist from Mrs. Clinton, to directly appeal
to a group of voters that both Schumer and D'Amato consider
critical to the outcome of this year's election: Women.
</P>
<P>
   Both Schumer and Mrs. Clinton made particular mention of
D'Amato's opposition to abortion rights. In addition, they argued
that D'Amato had opposed legislation sponsored by Schumer that
would impose penalties for domestic violence. Valentine said that
D'Amato had voted against the legislation only because it was part
of a larger Democratic crime bill that included spending on social
programs.
</P>
<P>
   While D'Amato treated Mrs. Clinton's gingerly, his Democratic
opponent glowed as he sat at her side _ first at the fund-raiser
and then at a round-table discussion with victims of domestic
violence.
</P>
<P>
   At the fund-raiser, Schumer attacked D'Amato in the kind of
harsh language that has come to mark this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in for a tough, tough fight,'' he said, speaking to a
room filled with contributors. ``We are up against an opponent who
knows no shame, who will try to distort my record beyond
recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton was nearly as strong in her language as Schumer,
using this appearance _ which will be followed by campaign stops in
Denver, Seattle, Portland and San Francisco _ to assume a strong
partisan stance in a particularly contested election and against a
politician to who created much difficulty for her while he was
running the Senate Whitewater investigation. D'Amato backed out of
his role on the Senate investigating committee amid signs that it
was hurting him politically in New York, where Clinton remains
popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really important that people of New York look at Chuck's
opponent's record for his entire term, not a year in which he runs
for re-election,'' Mrs. Clinton said, her face set and intense.
``What is important is what he does every single day: Aligning
himself with the Republican leadership, voting down the line with
people who don't represent the interests of the mainstream voters
of New York. Whether it is Medicare or whether it is choice, he is
on the wrong side of New York and of women.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Mrs. Clinton's appearance seemed certain to provide a
boost to Schumer, it at times overshadowed him as well. This was a
rare trip by the first lady on her own since Clinton acknowledged
his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. She drew a warmer reception
than Schumer at the fund-raiser; she also drew a larger crowd of
reporters than would normally turn out for a visit by a first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton appeared at times dazed and distant as she sat in
on the panel, with victims of domestic violence and then toured a
computerized mail sorting facility at the shelter. She offered no
response when a local television reporter, standing directly in
front of her, inquired twice if he might ask Mrs. Clinton a
question. By contrast, one of Mrs. Clinton's aides grabbed the
reporter's arm and demanded that he stop trying to talk to the her.

   ``In the 1930s, the concept of riding a wave while standing on a
plank was completely alien to everyone.'' _ Don James
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Surfing San Onofre to Point Dume, 1936-1942''
(Chronicle Books; $24.95) is more than a good, albeit short, read.
It's also a good look.
</P>
<P>
   The small coffee-table book chronicles a period in the lives of
some of Southern California's first wave riders as seen through the
lens of surf photographer and dentist Don James.
</P>
<P>
   An insightful foreword by C.R. Stecyk, interspersed with little
samples of the photos to come, sets the scene: ``Six years of
exuberance. Hometown boy Don James is witness to, and participates
in, the halcyon inception of California beach culture ... a
transitory Southern California in the years before World War II
changed the region forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The standard-size pictures that follow _ most of them black and
white _ are presented in a photo-album style, without captions, in
a chapter titled simply ``Plates.'' Captions follow in the
``Notes'' section.
</P>
<P>
   James' earliest pictures were taken with Kodak folding
cameras.Some of the most eye-catching snapshots are of men riding
shoulder-high waves at San Onofre, Dana Point and Hermosa Beach;
the gang piled into a 1925 Hudson with giant boards stacked high on
the roof; guitar playing and dancing around campfires on deserted
shores; and one of James holding a big lobster.
</P>
<P>
   James died in 1996, but his images of a culture in its infancy
live on.
</P>
<P>
   Our rating: Two and a half stars.

LEHMAN BROTHERS REPORTS SHARP DROP IN THIRD-QUARTER EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (cb) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lehman Brothers Holdings reported Wednesday a 23.4
percent decline in third-quarter earnings from a year ago, saying
that worldwide financial turmoil had buffeted its bottom line. But
executives said that the investment bank was still operating
profitably amid some of the most turbulent market conditions in a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Like most multinational banks and brokerage houses, Lehman saw a
string of stellar quarter-on-quarter profit growth derailed in
August, when Russia devalued its currency and defaulted on some
debt. That event triggered a chain reaction in financial markets
everywhere and continues to crimp new issues of debt and equity
securities, the bread and butter business of Lehman and many
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman Brothers earned $151 million, or $1.10 a share fully
diluted, compared with $197 million or $1.30 a share in the quarter
a year earlier. The most recent earnings, which met analysts'
estimates, were down by almost half from the second quarter of this
year, which was its best ever.
</P>
<P>
   But business in the first half of the year was so strong that
Lehman is still having a robust year, earning $662 million for the
first nine months, up 43 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, core businesses have slumped so far this month, with
relatively few companies issuing new bonds or stock, said John
Cecil, chief financial officer. He declined to make a profit
projection for the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Mergers and acquisitions advisory and other investment banking
businesses helped to generate profits amid a downturn in Lehman's
trading operations, Cecil said, adding that the firm derived
two-thirds of its earnings last quarter from investment banking.
Moreover, he sees some tentative signs that buyers and sellers will
return to the stagnant fixed income market before long.
</P>
<P>
   Bond market troubles ``have largely run their course,'' Cecil
said, adding that the ``risk premium'' on bonds other than United
States Treasury securities in the wake of the Russian crisis has
stopped growing. When the risk premium grows, the bonds lose value.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a slowness in business,'' he said. ``Clients and
customers are still waiting for the dust to settle. But if it
continues to settle, people will come back into the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Cecil added that the firm completed four large debt transactions
in the United States and Germany last week, ending a dry spell.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman stock rallied Wednesday on the news along with most
financial stocks, rising $1.75, to $37.4375. The stock had fallen
60 percent from its peak in July, one of the sharpest drops of any
financial company.
</P>
<P>
   Sallie Krawcheck, a securities industry specialist at Sanford C.
Bernstein &AMP; Company, said Lehman's third-quarter earnings drop was
expected, and that its strong profits in mergers and acquisitions
advisory showed that its attempts to diversify into non-trading
banking businesses paid dividends in a tough time. But she said she
does not expect good results in the final quarter of the year,
predicting that firm would break even or fall into a loss for the
quarter. &QL;

150 MILLION JOBLESS, GLOBAL STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ At least 150 million people worldwide are jobless, and
this number is expected to rise by millions before the end of the
year, the International Labor Organization said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 million people have joined the unemployed this year
because of the financial crisis in Asia, the ILO said in issuing
its World Employment Report, 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
   By year's end, as many as 12 million more could be unemployed,
mostly in Asia, said Rashid Amjad, the report's author. The newly
released global jobless numbers are up substantially from the
previous ILO compilation in 1996-97, which listed 128 million
jobless.
</P>
<P>
   Among the unemployed are an estimated 60 million people between
the ages of 15 and 24, who are searching for work but cannot find
it, said the study by the ILO, a U.N. agency based in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Only labor markets in the United States and, to a lesser extent,
the European Union, benefited from economic growth in the first
half of 1998, the 258-page report said.

DEION HONORED FOR `PRIME TIME' PLAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Like his punt return for a touchdown Monday
night, Deion Sanders has provided yet another one of those
something-you've-never-seen before-and-probably-won't-see-again
moments.
</P>
<P>
   The NFC honored Sanders yesterday as the player of the week in a
special ``PrimeTime'' category for his performance in Monday's 31-7
victory against the New York Giants. The NFL awards conference
players of the week on offense, defense and special teams.
</P>
<P>
   NFL spokesman Chris McCloskey said the league created a
``one-time only'' category because Sanders' effort, which included
touchdowns on a 59-yard punt return and a 71-yard interception
return, and a 55-yard pass reception that set up a third score,
overlapped so many areas.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the name?
</P>
<P>
   ``He did it on Monday night in prime time. And his nickname is
Prime Time,'' McCloskey said. ``We felt it would be appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL Films president Steve Sabol said he ranks Sanders' effort
among the top 10 efforts all-time and puts it in the same category
as the NFL record six-touchdown game by Bears great Gale Sayers in
1965.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SHE crossed the finish line in a blaze of bright colors and sweet
grace, her long fingernails slicing the air, her legs pumping, her
brilliant eyes dancing their way into so many hearts.
</P>
<P>
   She was beautiful, elegant and gifted. Florence Griffith Joyner
was too good to be true. And for that, she was haunted not just
until the day she died but, sadly, beyond.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy has been performed on Griffith Joyner, who died
Monday at her home in California. The results are supposed to shed
light on the cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   But in reality, the medical examiner's report probably will not
change those opinions formed a decade ago or tell us any more than
what we know. Griffith Joyner's heart stopped, and it ended a
young, sparkling life far too soon. It ended a life whose greatest
athletic triumph never wholeheartedly was embraced, particularly by
those within her sport, because it was too good for many to
believe.
</P>
<P>
   It ended a life that was pioneering but, sadly, not pioneering
the way Babe Didrikson Zaharias was pioneering, or Wilma Rudolph,
or Nadia Comaneci.
</P>
<P>
   Those were lives whose staggering Olympic performances were
revered and worshiped _ never questioned, never considered too
far-fetched, never rumored to be enhanced by the chemical jolt of
steroids or the surge of human growth hormones.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith Joyner pioneered the era of the raised eyebrow. The
questioning smirk. The whispers.
</P>
<P>
   She was the first of her era forced to defend her greatness amid
showers of adoration; she was among the first to strive for
perfection, achieve it and then feel the sting of doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of Olympic fans fell in love with Griffith Joyner
at the 1988 Olympics and with good reason. She not only had style,
but her performances were stunning, winning gold medals in the
100-meter dash, the 200 and the 4x100 and anchoring the
silver-medal 4x400.
</P>
<P>
   She drastically lowered her career-best times and chopped gobs
of time off the world records. In 1987, FloJo had career bests of
10.96 seconds in the 100-meter dash and 21.96 in the 200. A year
later, she established the 100 world record in 10.49 and the 200
mark in 21.34.
</P>
<P>
   It was a remarkable discovery of speed. Few in the sport thought
such improvement could be anything but chemically produced.
Whispers became rumor, which became accepted as fact.
</P>
<P>
   A Brazilian athlete said Griffith Joyner ``must be doing
something that isn't normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. quarter-miler Darrell Robinson took a $25,000 check
from Germany's Stern magazine, then reported to the publication
that he purchased human growth hormones for FloJo before the 1988
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Later, U.S. sprinter Gwen Torrence said she believed Griffith
Joyner was using performance-enhancing drugs. Even Sen. Joseph
Biden in a report about drug use in sports showed before-and-after
photos of Griffith Joyner as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest performance of Griffith Joyner's career became a
haunting pioneering moment, even though she never tested positive
for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   No one seemed to want to believe FloJo was overwhelmingly
talented, like Babe, Wilma and Nadia. No one wanted to believe she
might have done in 1988 what Bob Beamon did in the long jump in
1968. That is, have the performance of a lifetime on the greatest
stage of all.
</P>
<P>
   No one questioned Beamon's mark, which broke the world record by
more than two feet. But 1968 was not 1988. In 1988, Canadian Ben
Johnson similarly shattered a world record and failed a drug test.
FloJo failed her sport's believability test.
</P>
<P>
   Now, to hear the backhanded condolences flow in the wake of
Griffith Joyner's death has been amusing at best, sickening at
worst. In print and in private, Griffith Joyner has been associated
with the likes of Len Bias and Lyle Alzado, athletes who tested
positive for drugs and consequently died young.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe FloJo did take illegal drugs. It is easy to put it all
together and make that conclusion, after the way she ran stronger,
looked different, even sounded different at the Seoul Games, then
slipped away from competition and occasionally battled illnesses
until her death.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we never will know. But we do know she blazed a
colorful, graceful trail in 1988. She was not wholly revered.
Instead, she ushered in the era of suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith Joyner once said of the drug rumors: ``If you have
peace with yourself, you're going to have peace with everyone else.
I have peace.''
</P>
<P>
   She reached her ultimate peace Monday. In another era, she would
have been remembered for the elegance she showed the world. She
would find her place in history and be revered forever.
</P>
<P>
   But in this era, we cannot expect such a thing. That would be
too good to be true.

THE FORCE IS WITH BLANE MORGAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before his team's showdown with Air Force last week, the issue
seemed fairly simple to Colorado State linebacker Willie Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to stop Blane Morgan,'' he said simply, ``because he's
the heart and soul of their team.''
</P>
<P>
   That much became obvious as the game unfolded in front of an
ESPN viewing audience. Morgan, at quarterback, accumulated 234
yards and rallied the Falcons from a 17-point deficit, scoring
three times and setting up three Jackson Whiting field goals _ the
last of which came with 11 seconds remaining and beat the Rams,
30-27.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the middle of the third quarter, I told Blane he needed to
take over the team,'' Falcons coach Fisher DeBerry said, ``and
that's what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, the Falcons (3-0) will arrive at Amon Carter Stadium on
Saturday with a No. 23 national ranking and new stature as the
favorite for the Western Athletic Conference championship.
</P>
<P>
   And for the fifth consecutive season, the starting quarterback
is a member of the Morgan family of Carrollton.
</P>
<P>
   Brother Beau _ who remains under contract to the Cowboys while
fulfilling a military obligation _ is the more renowned of the two,
being the only player in Division I-A history with consecutive
seasons (1995-96) in which he exceeded 1,000 yards both rushing and
passing.
</P>
<P>
   But in terms of ``taking over'' the team, and guiding Air
Force's spread option offense, the current quarterback is the more
assertive of the Morgans.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the field, Beau's a little faster than I am,'' Blane Morgan
says, ``but I think in terms of personality we're a lot different.
Maybe that's why we get along so well. He's a real laid-back guy,
and I have a tendency to have more of a fiery personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his brother, Morgan played high school ball for his father
Barry at Trinity Christian Academy. He considered going to Navy,
then finally arrived at Air Force as a defensive back.
</P>
<P>
   ``My freshman year, I was playing in the secondary on the JV
team,'' said Morgan, now a senior, ``but we ran out of
quarterbacks. So they asked if there was anyone who could run the
offense, and that's how I became the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of funny _ we didn't run this offense in high
school, and I had played both ways and felt comfortable at safety.
Looking back, though, I'm not sure I would be playing at this level
if I was still a defensive back. So it turned out well.''
</P>
<P>
   For Morgan, switching from defense back to offense wasn't the
only adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to adjust to a life here that is definitely a
challenge _ different from anything you've known before,'' he said.
``You're up at 6 a.m. for a day that includes a full load of
classes plus military training, plus practice, and you often don't
get to bed until midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get a lot of sleep sometimes, and we don't have
special food like they do at some other schools. We eat what they
give us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking 18 semester hours and there are guys taking 21.
Everyone here has learned how to work, and knows how to work hard.
But it helps you _ overcoming adversity is expected. And in the
end, it's worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the field, I think having a full year in the system has
definitely made me a better player. This year, I know what I'm
doing, and I don't get surprised by anything.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that factor that primarily impressed DeBerry last week, in
what he called one of the greatest comebacks in school history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' he said, ``I think you would have to call it that _ to
come from 17 points down against a team that is the defending WAC
champion and favored to win it again. We had 50,000 people there
and a national television audience, so it was a great win for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the thing that really impressed me about the offense was
that they never seemed to panic or lose their poise. We just went
right on doing the things we normally do.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan does admit to one added incentive, beyond the fact that
the commanding general had decreed a barracks inspection if the
Falcons lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We beat them CSU (24-0) up there last year,'' he said, ``but
they came in here two years ago _ my brother's senior year _ and
beat us, 42-41, when we blew a four-touchdown lead. They did a
little talking after that, and the memory kind of ignited our
fires.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, brother Beau was watching from the sideline. When the
Falcons take on TCU, there will be even more Morgans around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my folks and a lot my friends are coming,'' Morgan
said. ``So I'm looking forward to this one.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Jean Claude Compas didn't sleep well Tuesday
night. Like other Haitian-American New Yorkers, he stayed up
phoning relatives and friends in Haiti to monitor Hurricane
Georges' destructive path and to make sure loved ones were spared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called my father and mother at 1 o'clock, at 3 o'clock and
at 7,'' he said. ``I think a lot of people did that.''
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane, which caused more than $1 billion in damage to
Puerto Rico and wreacked havoc on other Caribbean islands, hit
Haiti Tuesday, leaving 13 dead, the highest toll of any country in
the storm's path so far.
</P>
<P>
   And Americans with ties to Haiti, the poorest country in the
Western Hemisphere, reacted by frantically phoning their homeland,
following Internet, radio and television reports, and vowing to
donate money and supplies to hurricane victims.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Floradel Samedi, the outreach director at the Haitian
Refugee Center, said there would be a special appeal to Haitians in
the metropolitan area. With 120,000 Haitian-Americans, Miami has
the third largest concentration of people from Haiti, after New
York and Boston. ``We will make an appeal on the two radio stations
that have programs in Creole tomorrow morning,'' the director said.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, where as many as 30,000 Haitian-Americans live,
Ernst Cadet, president of the Haitian American Community Center,
said: ``We really just started getting information on what kind of
damage there is and what kinds of needs they have this afternoon,
so we haven't had a chance to do much yet. In the next couple of
days we will open the community centers up to donations of canned
food, water, clothing, and hopefully send some shipments.''
</P>
<P>
   The high death toll from Hurricane Georges in Haiti was
attributed in part to the flimsy construction of many buildings
there, not because the hurricane arrived with more strength. For
example, six deaths occurred when a house collapsed in the
Carrefour Feuille neighborhood of Port-au-Prince, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that thing that happened to Puerto Rico happened to Haiti,
there would be no more country,'' said Compas, a family
practitioner who is a Haitian-American leader in New York. ``We're
already in a bad situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Compas was lucky because he could get through to his relatives
in Port-au-Prince. Other Haitian-Americans were having difficulty
contacting friends and relatives, as phone cables were downed by
high winds.
</P>
<P>
   Claude Ralph, 43, a parking attendant, anxiously waited in line
at the Boby Express Phone and Transfer Center on Flatbush Avenue in
Brooklyn to phone relatives. He had made several unsuccessful
attempts to get in touch with his two teen-age sons and
grandmother, who live in Fort Liberte, near the Dominican border.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get through,'' said Ralph, who lived through two major
hurricanes, in Haiti. ``Nothing works down there. I've heard
there's no electricity and everything is flooded. I'll keep trying
all day if necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispanola
with Haiti, officials said 12 people died.
</P>
<P>
   At one Bronx school, children with relatives in the Dominican
Republic worried as they monitored the storm. At Middle School 45
in the Belmont section of the Bronx, Cynthia Munoz, 13, and Alicia
Sanchez, 13, members of the Weather Club, followed the path of the
hurricane on the Weather Channel Web site, but also got firsthand
information from relatives on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Alicia spoke to an aunt and a cousin. ``They said the backyard
is gone _ no more plants, no fruits, no barbecue,'' she said.
``Everything just flew away.''

CLINTON REBUFFED IN TRY FOR QUICK PUNISHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republican leaders Wednesday rebuffed White
House pleas for Congress to swiftly punish President Clinton to
avoid a lengthy impeachment process, prompting Democratic lawmakers
to accuse the GOP of exploiting the sex scandal for potential
election-day gains.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton and his allies continued to search for alternatives
to full-scale impeachment proceedings, House Speaker Newt Gingrich
sent his strongest signal yet that the House has no intention of
abbreviating the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand how people can rush to a solution before
they finish the investigation,'' Gingrich told reporters. Moments
earlier, Gingrich had privately informed Democratic leaders that he
will not speed up the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current Republican plan, the House would approve a
full impeachment inquiry in early October, permitting the Judiciary
Committee to open a formal investigation. GOP committee members
said the hearings would likely begin after the November elections,
which Democratic strategists fear would leave the long shadow of
Clinton's alleged misdeeds looming over the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, abandoning its conciliatory tone toward
Republican congressional leaders, joined Democratic lawmakers in
portraying the GOP plans as a recipe for an interminable, partisan
battle, although some Clinton strategists privately conceded that
the attack was marked partly by desperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have concern that everything we are hearing tells us that
they want to string this matter out forever and ever,'' said White
House press secretary Michael McCurry. ``We don't think they are
doing it in the best interests of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the increasingly partisan controversy, McCurry added: ``The
fact that this matter is now going to drag on and on and on
endlessly has to be laid at the foot of Speaker Gingrich.''
</P>
<P>
   Just after McCurry spoke, Massachusetts Senator John F. Kerry
made his own call for an expedited impeachment process. Kerry
warned Republicans that by supporting a long process, ``you are
putting our institutions on trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The House Democratic leader, Representative Richard Gephardt of
Missouri, said Congress should be able to decide Clinton's fate
relatively quickly by reviewing the 445-page report and 18 boxes of
supporting material assembled by the independent counsel, Kenneth
W. Starr. The report alleges that Clinton committed 11 possibly
impeachable offenses stemming from his relationship with former
White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, if the Republicans don't want to drag this
out, we can do it fairly and judiciously and justly in the next 30
days or so,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Henry J. Hyde, an Illinois Republican who is
chairman of the Judiciary Committee, issued a statement rebuking
the Democratic critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president had eight months to tell the truth, but instead
he sent his staff out to declare his innocence to the world,'' Hyde
said. ``Now the Democrats want to shut down an inquiry of his
behavior in 30 days. I think the American people want and deserve a
full, fair, and independent review of the allegations against the
president, not a quick peek or passing glance.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, officials said Clinton continued to consult
members of both parties, seeking a penalty short of impeachment.
Notable among the possible penalties is a censure, with a large
fine, which Clinton would accept while standing before all 535
members of Congress, an unprecedented scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as they weighed other options, White House officials
appeared resigned to a formal impeachment process. ``Realistically
speaking, I guess you have to be reconciled to that,'' McCurry
said.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a full impeachment inquiry disheartened many
Democratic congressional strategists, who had hoped as recently as
July to gain five or 10 seats in the House. They now say they fear
losing more than 20 seats because of the devastating publicity
surrounding the president.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat and a
member of the Judiciary Committee, asserted that the Republican
impeachment strategy is geared toward the election. ``Even if the
Republicans decide they can't impeach him, they don't want to do
that until after the election, because they don't want to anger
their base,'' Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   Across Washington, from Capitol Hill to the White House, it
appeared that Clinton's future is uncertain and the process by
which it will be determined is adrift, with no definition, no
roadmap, and no obvious outcome. White House aides continued to
meet with members of Congress, but there was little progress to
report on any front.
</P>
<P>
   Within the already dispirited White House team, there was a
bizarre sense of helplessness, according to some officials. A cadre
of aides, led by deputy chief of staff John Podesta, have dedicated
themselves to lobbying Congress for help. Podesta spent much of
Wednesday on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Others worked the telephones, talking to the news media. A
smaller group has reached out to what they call the ``party gray
hairs,'' battle-worn Democratic elders who may have insight on
Clinton's plight.
</P>
<P>
   Still other Clinton aides are seeking advice from long-time
Washington insiders such as Lloyd Cutler, Clinton's former White
House counsel, and Jody Powell, who was President Jimmy Carter's
press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Carter himself harshly criticized Clinton's actions Tuesday
night, saying he felt ``deeply embarrassed'' by them. Speaking at
Emory University, Carter predicted that the House would impeach
Clinton, but he would not be convicted by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, others in the White House have reached out to
Republicans who are regarded as statesmen on Capitol Hill. Clinton
aides are reportedly eyeing former Senate majority leader Bob Dole
to help lobby Congress, but Dole has not agreed to play any role.
</P>
<P>
   However, a respected Republican strategist _ a veteran of two
prior administrations _ expressed belief that Howard Baker, a
former Senate majority leader and onetime chief of staff to
President Reagan, would be willing to help broker a deal by serving
Clinton as an informal envoy to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The strategist, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that
Baker retains respect on Capitol Hill but would not likely sway
many votes. Still, his involvement would be perceived as a positive
development for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, who is now a Washington lawyer, released a statement
saying he has had no contact with the White House ``concerning the
Starr inquiry and is unaware of any efforts to recruit his
assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, associates of former President George Bush
said ``he would never get involved,'' despite efforts by White
House strategists to include him among GOP elders who might condemn
a protracted effort to impeach Clinton. In several broadcast
interviews touting his new book, Bush has been reluctant to comment
on the White House crisis.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Republican leaders said no one who could be
considered a GOP statesman has lobbied them on Clinton's behalf.
Some GOP leaders expressed amusement at efforts by Clinton and many
members of Congress to quickly dispose of the high-stakes matter.
'`There are people who want this off the hook all over the place,''
said Representative Richard K. Armey of Texas, the House majority
leader.
</P>
<P>
   But other lawmakers endorsed a speedy resolution, including
Senator Edward M. Kennedy. He described Kerry's proposal as ``a
useful and constructive suggestion'' and said the public is
``increasingly concerned about the fairness of this process.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the partisan mood, the House voted last night to table a
resolution to impeach Starr. Filed by Representative Alcee
Hastings, a Florida Democrat who was convicted of bribery as a
federal judge in a Senate impeachment trial in 1988, the issue was
tabled, 340-71. The only Massachusetts lawmaker to support
Hastings's motion was Representative John W. Olver, a Pittsfield
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a skirmish escalated over complaints from the White House
and Democratic lawmakers that Starr may have withheld evidence
favorable to Clinton in the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   Starr issued a statement saying his report to Congress twice
explained that Lewinsky said Clinton never instructed her to lie
about their sexual relationship, contrary to Democratic complaints
that his report ignored her statement.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Starr denied Wednesday that he has withheld any
relevant information in the Lewinsky case, as Gephardt and others
have suggested. ``In particular, we have provided all the
statements (e.g., grand jury transcripts, FBI interview memoranda,
audio recordings, and handwritten and other statements) of all
persons in the referral,'' Starr stated in a letter to Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee, which this week made public 3,183
pages of the material, was scheduled to meet Thursday to decide how
much of the remainder to release. But the meeting was postponed
until Friday to permit the Democratic staff to complete its review
of the material, which is contained in 16 boxes under heavy guard
in a House office building. Once the committee acts, the documents
could be made public next week.

SENATE OKS BANKRUPTCY MEASURE 

</HEADLINE>

By JOHN DRAKE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate passed a sweeping overhaul of the U.S.
bankruptcy system Wednesday, with major differences to resolve with
the House, including whether the law will significantly shrink the
Texas Homestead exemption.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger fight will be over the key terms in the bill _ the
needs test. This is the formula designed to force more affluent
individuals to file for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 13 of
the law, which is likely to require them to pay back more to
creditors than they would under the current law.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals generally prefer filing under Chapter 7 of the law,
where their unsecured debt is quickly wiped clean, with the payment
based on the assets they have to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The free ride is over on the part of those who would exploit
the bankruptcy system for financial gain,'' said Sen. Charles
Grassley, R-Iowa, who co-sponsored the bill with Sen. Richard
Durbin, D-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Senators lauded their bipartisan effort to combat the
accelerating rise of bankruptcy filings.
</P>
<P>
   According to U.S. Bankruptcy Court statistics, 1.35 million
people filed for bankruptcy in 1997, up from 500,000 in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate version gives bankruptcy court judges more discretion
on which Chapter of the bankruptcy law should be applied, but it
takes a harder line on the issue of homestead exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   This exemption helps property owners protect property from
claims in bankruptcy allowing Texans to protect their homes from
claims by creditors.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill, which was passed by a 97-1 vote, caps that
exemption at $100,000. There is no limit on homestead exemptions
under the House version.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley would not say whether the five Senate conferees would
budge on the homestead issue.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate passed by voice vote earlier Wednesday a ``Sense
of the Congress'' amendment to emphasize the importance of the cap.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment ``sends the message to the House ... that this
provision is essential to meaningful bankruptcy reform'' and
``closes a loophole that allows too many debtors to keep their
luxury homes, while their legitimate creditors ... get left out in
the cold,'' said Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., the amendment's sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is pushing the Senate bill, and has
threatened to veto a measure along the lines of the House measure.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate version creates a flexible means-based test in which
individuals who are financially able to repay 30 percent of their
unsecured debt must file under Chapter 13, which requires a
repayment plan over a three- to five-year period. Judges have the
flexibility to provide exceptions in unusual cases.
</P>
<P>
   The House's bankruptcy bill has a series of tests and qualifiers
to determine if individuals file Chapter 13 or 7. If an
individual's income is under the national median, this test does
not apply.
</P>
<P>
   Under this complicated formula, individuals who can pay 20
percent or more of their unsecured debt _ loans not backed by
property _ over five years will have to file under Chapter 13.
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of issues where the House and Senate versions
agree:
</P>
<P>
   _ Child support and alimony payments are listed as a No. 1
priority for payments during and after bankruptcy in both measures.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Senate version also calls for greater disclosure from
credit card companies, specifically requiring companies to print
the amount of time it will take customers to pay off their debt if
they pay the minimum payment every month.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate conferees named Wednesday to the conference committee
to deal with the differences are: Grassley, Durbin, Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah, Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., and Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides should be able to iron out a compromise to send to
the president, even though only about two weeks remain in the
legislative session, because of the urgent and bipartisan nature of
the bill, Grassley said.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas the mostly widely followed issue likely will be the
fight over the homestead exemption.
</P>
<P>
   Most members of the Texas delegation to Washington have been
critical of the $100,000 limit, as have Gov. George W. Bush and
other state officials.
</P>
<P>
   Before the House accepted an amendment that eliminated a
$100,000 cap on homestead exemptions, Rep. Ken Bentsen, D-Houston,
in early June blasted the Republican leadership for what he deemed
contradictory claims about states' rights.
</P>
<P>
   He sent a letter with signatures from most other Texas
representatives to Texas' senators, Republicans Phil Gramm and Kay
Bailey Hutchison, asking them to eliminate the monetary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm hopes to introduce an amendment in conference with the
House to change the homestead provision. His amendment would:
</P>
<P>
   _ Exempt homesteads for any claims if they were bought more than
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   _ Limit exemptions to $1 million for homestead investments that
are between 1 and 3 years old;
</P>
<P>
   _ Limit homestead exemptions to $100,000 for properties held
less than year.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment also says judges can make their own determination
if an individual fraudulently transferred assets to avoid repayment
prior to filing bankruptcy.

&HT;        KERRY WARNS REPUBLICANS NOT TO PLAY PARTISAN GAMES
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Mark D. Preston  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Sept. 23 -- Republicans might face a backlash from
voters in the November elections if they continue to play partisan
politics with President Clinton's fate, Sen. John Kerry warned GOP
House Leaders Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should not lower impeachment standards to reverse the
outcome on an election that they do not like,'' said Kerry, a
Massachusetts Democrat. ``If they do, they risk ... inviting
Americans of all walks of life to condemn them for their lack of
concern for the American people and for basic decency.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said the release of Clinton's grand jury testimony by the
House Judiciary Committee Monday -- which took place along a party
line vote -- demonstrates the presidential investigation is being
driven by GOP political forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly there are to many indications at this time we are
following down a dangerous path,'' Kerry said.
</P>
<P>
   The release of both Clinton's and Monica S. Lewinsky's testimony
followed the release of the 445 page salacious Starr report earlier
this month that detailed intimate encounters between the two.
</P>
<P>
   For the past week, Kerry has been advocating for an expeditious
resolution to the scandal involving the president's extramarital
affair with Lewinsky. Dragging the investigation out for the
purpose of embarrassing the president is damaging the country, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Democrat said he has been approached by a
number of Republican senators who told him they agree that this
issue needs to be quickly resolved. Kerry also said, he has been
talking to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, a Mississippi
Republican, about as quick resolution they have plans to talk about
it further in the future.
</P>
<P>
   But Kerry's plea does not seem to have resonated across the
Capitol to the House. Prior to Kerry's remarks, House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, a Georgia Republican, rebuked a request by his
counterpart House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, Missouri
Democrat, to quickly decide on what direction Congress plans on
taking.
</P>
<P>
   ``For anybody to talk about anything before we finish the
investigative process simply puts the cart before the horse,''
Gingrich said, adding there might be more evidence about Clinton's
transgressions that needs to be considered.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, Kerry made headlines when he suggested on
``Meet the Press'' that the president should appear before the
Judiciary Committee to explain his actions. The Massachusetts
Democrat said he felt ``personally compelled'' to make the
suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, Kerry said he thinks people -- including his
colleagues -- misinterpreted him, and he clarified his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not advise the president to simply to appear here in
some totally uncontrolled and uncertain fashion,'' Kerry said. ``I
think that would be dangerous and ill-advised.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said he thinks a deal could be worked out between Clinton
and House leaders including putting parameters on such things as
punishment so the truth can revealed in a more timely fashion and
the issue put to rest.
</P>
<P>
   However, not all of his colleagues believe Kerry's idea of the
president appearing before the Judiciary Committee is the right
avenue to resolve this issue. Sen. Richard Bryan, a Nevada
Democrat, said he too hopes the investigation is resolved quickly
but does not endorse Kerry's idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Sen. Kerry's proposal was maybe premature,'' Bryan
said, adding the Constitution clearly outlines the procedures to
follow in such cases.

A CENTRIST SHIFTS TO LEFT TO ATTRACT GERMAN VOTES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROGER COHEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRIER, Germany _ The banner above his head read ``The New
Center,'' but Gerhard Schroeder's oratory on Wednesday was somewhat
to the left of that as he lambasted tax-evading millionaires,
praised solar energy and the welfare state, and vowed to attack
growing economic inequality in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   As Wolfgang Diegner, a 59-year-old teacher, listened to
Schroeder, the leader of the Social Democratic Party, who is
challenging Chancellor Helmut Kohl in elections on Sunday, he was
torn by conflicting emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly time for a change,'' said Diegner, who voted
for Kohl in 1994 but now thinks that after 16 years as chancellor,
it may be time for him to step down. ``But is Schroeder the right
man? He always talks in generalities, and I find it hard to trust
him that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Such uncertainty appears to be widespread. A palpable lassitude
toward Kohl, who is 68 and has ruled since 1982, seems to be partly
offset by doubts over the real intentions of Schroeder, leaving the
poll too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   More than a third of German voters say they are undecided. Some
opinion polls suggest Schroeder's lead has narrowed to 2 percent;
others put the lead at closer to 5 percent. But Kohl has come from
behind to defeat four previous Social Democratic challengers, and
is clearly very much in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, standing Wednesday on a makeshift stage beneath a
Roman gate in the town where Karl Marx was born, sought to paint a
sinister picture of Kohl's rule.
</P>
<P>
   Not once did he mention Europe, the euro or German unification _
important themes, but also themes dear to the chancellor's heart.
The focus, rather, was on a fraying society that Schroeder said had
lost its bearings and vigor, a not so subtle German version of
``It's the Economy, Stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   With about 4.1 million Germans out of work _ or 10.6 percent of
the work force, jobs must be created for young people, he said. To
do this, he said, innovation would be necessary, but not innovation
paid for only by the less well off. He suggested that he would try
to find tax measures to yield $1,500 a month for poorer families
with at least two children, arguing that increased consumption
would increase production, which would create jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social Democratic statesmen in Denmark, in France and England
have managed to bring down unemployment, so why should we not do
the same here?'' Schroeder asked, apparently seeking to reassure
conservative German voters that a move to the left would merely be
in line with a Europe-wide trend. In fact French unemployment
remains stubbornly high, although it has fallen slightly under
Lionel Jospin's socialist government.
</P>
<P>
   Many German business executives are convinced that the real key
to tackling unemployment is to cut the high taxes and other charges
that add about 42 percent to salary costs. But they also support
the comprehensive welfare system, which has long provided Germany
with a formidable cohesiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed this week Jost Stollman, a successful businessman
recruited by Schroeder as an economics adviser and probable
economics minister if the Social Democrats win, called the social
security system ``a prison'' for some people.
</P>
<P>
   Stollman later said he was speaking as a businessman rather than
as a representative of the Social Democratic Party. But the remark
illustrated how awkward Schroeder's ``New Center'' can appear as he
seeks to please both the workers who provide a bedrock of Social
Democratic support and the executives like those with whom he sits
on Volkswagen's board.
</P>
<P>
   Even on Wednesday, while Kohl's failings were relentlessly
attacked, Schroeder was much less specific about solutions. Another
listener, Friedhelm Feldman, a 59-year-old engineer, said: ``All
this is too vague, too soft, not concrete enough. I want change,
but I also want to know what I'm voting for.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schroeder seemed to strike a chord when he declared: ``We
want a new spirit in Germany, where people ask what they can do for
their country. It is not the duty of the chancellor to divide
people, but to bring them together. In his long years as
chancellor, Kohl has forgotten this, and that is why he must go.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sebastian Schiefer, a college student, said this theme was
central to Germany's future. ``We need hope and social justice,''
he said, ``not a society like this one, where the differences
between rich and poor grow bigger by the day.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, in an interview with the ZDF television network,
Kohl vigorously defended his record. ``These 16 years in office did
not fall out of the sky,'' he said. ``I didn't storm the
Chancellery with a ladder in 1982 and barricade myself in there.
I've faced the voters every four years and been re-elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder is well aware of this and _ even as he presses his
Clinton-Blair strategy of occupying a broad middle ground _ he may
have to sharpen his message to persuade hesitant voters that a
fifth term for Kohl would be one too many.

ADVERTISING: `GIVE A KID A HAND' 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JANE L. LEVERE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Ad Council is joining forces with the International
Advertising Association to distribute a new public service campaign
from the international group to encourage adults to do volunteer
work with children.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, carrying the theme ``Give a kid a hand,'' was
created by Barry Day, director for creative development at
Interpublic Group of Cos. in New York and worldwide creative
director for the international ad group, which has 4,700 members
involved with advertising or the media in 92 countries. There are
four 30-second television commercials and eight print
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   The print advertisements feature powerful black-and-white
photographs of the hands of an adult and a child. One photo, for
example, shows an adult teaching a child to write; another shows an
adult teaching a child how to tie a shoe. The copy in all the
advertisements says, ``The first five years of a child's life are
critical,'' and goes on to add: ``That's when their characters are
formed, that's when caring counts. Someone to show them how to do
things. Someone just to hold them.''
</P>
<P>
   Concluding that many children lack this support, the
advertisements urge readers to help, saying, ``It's not your money
_ it's you we want.''
</P>
<P>
   Television advertisements show adults working with children _ in
one spot, for example, a man teaches a girl how to use a computer _
and also urge viewers to ``give a kid a hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Vale, director general of the association, which is
celebrating its 60th anniversary, said the campaign, which was
introduced in Cairo in May at the association's biennial
conference, represented the organization's efforts to ``make a
lasting contribution'' to society.
</P>
<P>
   ``To make this contribution, we figured we could focus on the
child, who represents the future, as citizens, consumers,
professionals in our industry,'' he explained. ``Why not help them
realize their full potential?''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is being translated from English into five other
languages, Mandarin, Cantonese, Arabic, Spanish and Hindi, and
distributed to IAA chapters worldwide. According to the
association, The International Herald Tribune, CNN International,
ESPN, Star TV, and the international editions of Newsweek and
National Geographic are among the media outside the United States
that have made a commitment to run the advertising. Vale said the
campaign was developed with a budget of just over $250,000; the
money was contributed by corporate sponsors including AT&AMP;T, Chase
Manhattan Bank, Compaq Computer, Johnson &AMP; Johnson, the Phillip
Morris unit Kraft Jacobs Suchard, Nestle and Procter &AMP; Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   The Ad Council opted to pick up the IAA's campaign to distribute
within the United States because it was a good fit with the
council's own public service objectives. ``It clearly fits with our
mission to focus on the needs of children,'' said Ruth Wooden, the
council's president, who also helped the IAA develop its
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, the Ad Council has focused on public service
advertising that deals with children's issues like child abuse,
gender equality in education and preventing pediatric AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Since late August, the Ad Council has been distributing
information on the IAA's campaign to 10,000 U.S. newspapers and
magazines and 1,400 television stations around the country. The
television advertisements are being offered both with and without
voice-over, allowing them to be customized by local stations. The
National Association of Broadcasters is publicizing them to its
members.
</P>
<P>
   Print advertisements also refer readers to the IAA's ``Give a
kid a hand'' site on the World Wide Web (www.giveakidahand.org),
which will provide a link to the Web site for Kidscampaigns.org, a
project administered by the Benton Foundation. The foundation,
established in 1981 by the son of one of the founders of Benton &AMP;
Bowles, directs people to local organizations where they may
volunteer to help children.
</P>
<P>
   Murray Gaylord, chief operating officer of the Ad Council, said
he expected the IAA's campaign would get ``strong pickup, given the
importance of the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In its simplicity, the advertising is truly universal,'' he
said. ``It's very evergreen, and that's the strength of it. It
should get people out to do something to help. Its open-endedness
allows people to do whatever they feel is right. It's not asking
them for money.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaylord said the average Ad Council campaign generated $26
million worth of time and space annually; last year, all of its
campaigns generated a total of $1 billion worth of donated media.
</P>
<P>
   He said he expected both print and electronic media in the
United States to start running the IAA advertisements before the
end of September.

MANDELA FIRST AFRICAN TO RECEIVE CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States bestowed its highest civilian
honor on South African President Nelson Mandela on Wednesday,
awarding him the Congressional Gold Medal for his efforts to end
apartheid and promote racial harmony in his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The 80-year-old Mandela, who plans to retire next year, smiled
broadly as he was praised by President Clinton and lawmakers during
an elaborate ceremony in the historic Rotunda of the nation's
Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, I feel like the heavyweight boxing champion of the
world,'' Mandela declared, as the medal was presented by Clinton
and House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   In making him the 100th person and first African to receive the
honor in its 222-year history, Congress gave Mandela a place beside
George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Winston Churchill and Mother
Teresa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We owe it to Nelson Mandela not simply to give him this award,
but to live by the lesson he taught us and to tear down every last
vestige of apartheid in our own hearts _ everything that divides
us, one from another,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare display of unity, lawmakers briefly put aside their
differences with the president and they joined him in marveling at
Mandela's remarkable feat of surviving 27 years in prison under
apartheid to become the first democratically elected leader of his
country.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the remarks could have easily been applied to the
situation on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers are wrestling with a
decision about whether to hold impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics in a free society is a very rough and tumble
business, involving at times great personal pain,'' Gingrich said
at one point as his eyes filled with tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``And yet I would say to all of my colleagues who are here
today, when you contemplate 27 years in prison, when you imagine
walking out of that isolation with your heart larger and not
smaller, I think, President Mandela, you give every person on the
planet a personal witness to how valuable freedom must be to be
worthy of such a life.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there were no references made to the problem
confronting Clinton and the Congress, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif.,
said she was hopeful that the ``symbolism today with Mandela will
match our actions tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I pray we will all be better, more thoughtful forever, and
most just in our work, because we have been touched by Nelson
Mandela,'' said Waters, who serves on the Judiciary Committee
charged with deciding whether to recommend an impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela also steered clear of any reference to Clinton's
troubles, although he told reporters after the ceremony that he was
not abandoning the president at perhaps the most difficult time in
his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody expects me to desert a friend of mine,'' he said. He
also praised Clinton's attempts to improve race relations and place
more blacks and other minorities into high government positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That alone is a very good indication ... that in due course
(the United States) may have a black president,'' Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
   In accepting the award, Mandela called Clinton a friend to South
Africa. But he noted that Americans from all walks of life had
sacrificed and contributed to help the people of his country
overcome the racist system of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States and its people have played a significant
role in the birth of our new nation. Since the achievement of
democracy, the relations between our countries have been steadily
growing,'' Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The breadth of our relationship makes the United States an
indispensable partner in bringing material improvements in the
lives of our people, especially the poor, without which our
democracy would remain a hollow shell, and our stability fragile,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   The gold medal ceremony was the last event Mandela will attend
in the United States as a head of state. He said that when he steps
down next year, he plans to travel less and spend more time getting
to know his 26 grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, I forget their names,'' Mandela confessed. ``Now
I'll be able to remember all their names ... and advise them over
any problems that they have.''

BRITAIN ARRESTS 7 SUSPECTED OF LINKS TO BIN LADEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: See also TEXAS-BINLADEN-SUSPECT.) 
(af) 
 By WARREN HOGE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The British police arrested seven people Wednesday in a
coordinated raid apparently aimed at associates of Osama bin Laden,
the exiled Saudi financier accused of carrying out the bombings of
the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last month.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Scotland Yard declined to name any of the
suspects, but she said they had been detained as a result of ``a
carefully planned ongoing operation led by the Met's anti-terrorism
branch.'' The Met is shorthand for London's Metropolitan Police
Force.
</P>
<P>
   The Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, said it
was understood that the operation, code-named Challenge, was aimed
at associates of bin Laden, whom American officials suspect was the
mastermind behind the embassy bombings, which killed more than 250
people.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests were made under the Prevention of Terrorism Act of
1989, but it was not clear whether the police were operating under
new liberties granted them to arrest people suspected of plotting
terrorist acts elsewhere on British soil.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation expanding police power in such cases was passed here
in August in an emergency session of parliament called by Prime
Minister Tony Blair after the bombing in the town of Omagh, in
Northern Ireland, that killed 29 people. Under those new laws,
conspiring to commit terrorist crimes while in Britain is a
punishable offense.
</P>
<P>
   The police said that the arrests were part of a joint operation
between specialist Metropolitan police officers and agents from
MI5, the domestic military intelligence arm that is the equivalent
of the American Federal Bureau of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The police spokeswoman said that the seven men were picked up at
separate addresses in West and Northwest London early Wednesday
morning. An eighth address, described only as a ``business
premises,'' was also searched.
</P>
<P>
   It was believed that those arrested included a number of
Egyptians and at least one Saudi. Agence France-Presse reported
that one of those jailed was Adel Adbel Meguid Adbel Bari, who was
sentenced to death in absentia for involvement in a bombing plot in
Cairo in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The news agency also quoted Omar Bakri Mohammed, who claims to
be a spokesman here for bin Laden, as saying, ``They belong to
various Islamic movements, but some of them are linked to the
International Islamic Front, Osama bin Laden's movement.''
</P>
<P>
   London has been a haven for Arab dissidents, and several
countries in the Middle East, as well as France, have complained
that guerrilla groups are taking advantage of British law.
</P>
<P>
   The sweep was conducted by unarmed officers, and no injuries
were reported. The seven were being questioned at a London police
station.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the British agencies had been in touch with the
FBI, a Scotland Yard spokeswoman said, ``As a matter of routine,
the Metropolitan Police Service liases regularly with international
law enforcement agencies.''

N.J. COMPANY SET TO ROLL WITH MOVIE-PROMOTING KIOSKS FOR MALLS
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attention New Jersey editors.) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Coming soon to a shopping mall near you: free
movies, or at least the very best parts of them.
</P>
<P>
   Screenzone Media Networks plans to install up to 100
free-standing kiosks with 4-foot-by-8-foot screens at shopping
malls in the nation's top 20 markets during the next three years.
The first will debut Friday at the Del Amo Fashion Center in
Torrance, Calif.; the second and third kiosks will open by the end
of the year in New York and at a yet-to-be-named L.A.-area mall.
</P>
<P>
   Sony, Universal, Miramax, New Line and PolyGram have agreed to
supply trailers for the art deco-style kiosks, which will operate
continuously. The kiosks also will feature six touch-screens for
accessing show times at area theaters, reserving tickets, entering
contests and linking with entertainment Web sites along with
promotions for home videos and soundtracks.
</P>
<P>
   Screenzone Chairman Gary Leeds said malls are a sensible
location for the kiosks because customers are in a mood to buy and
may be planning to attend movies at nearby multiplexes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to create a destination within the mall,'' he
said, noting previous attempts to advertise movies at malls have
been limited to small monitors without interactive services.
</P>
<P>
   Leeds said the kiosks will be installed only in malls with
multiplexes and at least 10 million visitors annually. ``We're
looking for locations that have a lot of energy and excitement,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Screenzone, founded a year ago in South Orange, N.J., will make
its money by charging the studios for ad time. Its first promotion
is offering free passes and gift certificates for Sony's ``I Still
Know What You Did Last Summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Retail consultant Mark Kissel of Rockville, Md., said
Screenzone's kiosks may be effective because movie trailers usually
highlight a film's most memorable moments. ``Trailers tend to be a
hyperactive version of a movie, so there's a good chance that they
can get shoppers' attention,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the idea won't necessarily be a slam-dunk success, Kissel
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem that merchants face at a mall is that they have
three to five seconds to get the attention of shoppers, which is
quite a challenge,'' he noted. ``On a busy day at a mall, there's a
lot going on that's vying for your attention already -- the din,
the merchandise, the Muzak. It can be a real cacophony.'' &QL;

YANKEES' PLAYOFF ROTATION IN REHEARSALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joe Torre has not officially unveiled his rotation
for the division playoff series that starts Tuesday. But the final
dress rehearsals in the next few days give deep insight into what
the Yankees' manager is thinking.
</P>
<P>
   David Wells (18-4) will pitch Thursday night against Tampa Bay,
a sign that Torre does indeed intend to use him in the first game
of the playoffs, against either Texas or Anaheim. If a fifth game
were necessary, Wells would start that, too.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Pettitte (16-11) and Orlando Hernandez (11-4) will both
pitch Friday against Tampa Bay, and it is quite likely that
Pettitte will start Game 2 of the division series next Wednesday.
Hernandez would be available to pitch Game 4, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Both pitchers have been more effective at home than on the road
this year. Both have pitched better against Texas _ the likely
opponent _ in Yankee Stadium. But Pettitte is left-handed and more
experienced, and it may be that Torre is more comfortable with a
veteran in a game that could have enormous pressure if Wells were
to lose Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   David Cone (19-7) will now pitch Saturday against Tampa Bay,
placing him in line to pitch Game 3 on Oct. 2, a road game that
could be pivotal. If the series is tied at 1-1, Cone could put the
Yankees in front, and if they trailed by two games to none, Cone
would have the experience to stave off elimination. (Torre may
allow Cone to pitch five innings Saturday, to give him a chance to
get his 20th victory, but the manager said this is not a priority.)
</P>
<P>
   Hideki Irabu is scheduled to pitch Sunday, making it very likely
that he will pitch out of the bullpen in the playoffs as a long
reliever.
</P>
<P>
   If Torre carries 10 pitchers on his playoff roster, and five
starting pitchers among those 10, as it appears he will, then he
will have another decision to make in the days ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Since the relievers Mariano Rivera, Mike Stanton, Jeff Nelson
and Ramiro Mendoza are all but assured of being on the roster, then
Torre will have to choose between Graeme Lloyd, a left-hander, and
Darren Holmes, a right-hander. For balance, Torre said Wednesday,
keeping Lloyd would make sense.
</P>
<P>
   But Lloyd has struggled against left-handed batters in recent
weeks, and one scout said his fastball has dropped from the 90-mph
range to about 87 mph Holmes, on the other hand, is pitching
extremely well since being activated off the disabled list this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Some players are fighting injuries as the playoffs near:
</P>
<P>
   _ Darryl Strawberry, who has 24 home runs in 291 at-bats, was
hit on the left calf by a pitch on Monday and may not be available
for a few more days. Torre said he feels Strawberry can be ready to
swing in the playoffs with one start; in the past, Strawberry has
usually required multiple at-bats on consecutive days to find his
swing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tim Raines has a sore left knee, the result of tendinitis. But
he says he will be ready.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chuck Knoblauch, the Yankees' second baseman, was hit on the
left elbow by a pitch on Tuesday. He wore protective padding on the
joint Wednesday night, when he started against Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   _ The reliever Jay Tessmer was hit on the knee by a line drive
during batting practice Wednesday, and may miss the next couple of
games. He won't be on the post-season roster. &QL;

PAKISTANI LEADER SAYS HE WILL SIGN NUCLEAR TEST BAN TREATY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs top of story for rewriting and inserts. Picks up graf
starting: For the past, etc.) (sw) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Pakistan's prime minister said on Wednesday
that he would sign a treaty banning nuclear testing within the next
year, putting the onus on India to follow suit or be left with
North Korea as the only nations refusing to curb their nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But the prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, linked the decision to a
lifting of sanctions imposed on both India and Pakistan after their
nuclear tests in May.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said President Clinton told Sharif on Monday
that there could be no general waiver of sanctions until Pakistan
made a formal decision not to test nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Washington welcomed Sharif's announcement, made in
a speech to the General Assembly, even though it was conditional.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats at the United Nations are watching to see if India
makes the same gesture when its prime minister, Atal Behari
Vajpayee, addresses the Assembly on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif announced his decision only hours after a lunch meeting
with Vajpayee, at which they agreed on steps to reduce tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan's promise to sign the treaty is the first step toward
ending the nuclear arms race in South Asia, which erupted in May
when India set off a surprising series of explosions, embarrassing
American intelligence officials and diplomats. Pakistan quickly
followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and international lending agencies put
sanctions on loans to both India and Pakistan after the tests, but
the curbs have particularly pinched Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   For the past several months, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott has been trying to persuade Indian and Pakistani officials
to follow up pledges not to conduct more tests by putting their
signatures on the test-ban treaty within a certain time limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The within-a-year part is something that Strobe has been
working overtime to try and nail down,'' said Michael Krepon,
president of the Henry L. Stimson Center, a military research
organization in Washington. What Pakistan announced, he said,
amounted to ``a time-bound framework, a declaration of intent.''
</P>
<P>
   At their meeting on Wednesday, the two prime ministers agreed to
resume high-level talks on the disputed territory of Kashmir, which
have been in abeyance for more than a year. But Kashmir, now
divided between the two countries and not recognized by the United
Nations as belonging to either, will be only one of a number of
subjects on the agenda when negotiations open in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders also decided on Wednesday to activate a hot line
between them, improve transportation links between their countries
and put an end to sporadic firing across a cease-fire line in
Kashmir, which is killing people on both sides. Vajpayee hailed the
talks as the opening of ``a new chapter in Indo-Pakistani
cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither leader showed any sign of budging from long-held
positions on how to settle Kashmir's future, with Vajpayee refusing
to condone any outside help in negotiating the issue and Sharif
renewing calls for the United Nations to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians accuse the Pakistanis of arming and training rebels
in the Kashmir Valley, an area with a Muslim majority that has been
in revolt against Indian rule since 1989. The Pakistanis charge
India with repression and the deaths of thousands of Kashmiris
under Indian army rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Custodial killings, disappearances, arbitrary arrests, summary
executions continue to be daily occurrences,'' Sharif said on
Wednesday in his speech to the General Assembly. ``The nightmare of
the Kashmiri people continues.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Sharif spoke in the General Assembly there had been
reports in Pakistan that he would move closer to signing the 1996
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which Pakistanis have always said
they would not do until India signed.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan voted for the treaty at a U.N. conference in 1996;
India did not. The Indians tried to block its approval but were
overwhelmingly out-voted and lost friends in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   Asked on Wednesday if India was now ready to sign also, Vajpayee
told reporters they would have to wait until they heard his speech
on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif chose his one-year time frame for signing the treaty
deliberately. In September 1999, the nations that have adhered to
the treaty _ 150 to date _ will meet to review it. The test ban
will come into force then, but only if all 44 nations with nuclear
reactors have signed and ratified.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has signed the treaty, but President Clinton
has not yet sent it to the Senate for ratification.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan wants to be part of the 1999 conference to prevent the
rules from changing if India holds out against the treaty. Some
nations have suggested that in order to avoid a slow death of the
treaty, it might be necessary to overlook India and North Korea and
allow the treaty to go into effect with ratifications from only 42
nuclear-capable nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pakistan will oppose any attempt to change this fundamental
requirement,'' Sharif said, adding, ``Such a change can only be
made by consensus.'' He also said that if India resumed nuclear
testing at any time, Pakistan would review its decision to join the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the possible pitfalls on the road ahead, Pakistan's
decision was welcomed on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since the nuclear tests in South Asia in May 1998, I have
consistently urged India and Pakistan to sign the CTBT,'' U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a statement. ``The government
of Pakistan is to be commended for heeding the concern of the
international community.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Residents remain calm as the wait for Hurricane Georges
 &HT;    By Ian Trontz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Karen Jacobs didn't panic in August
1992 when Hurricane Andrew built up a running start in the Atlantic
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was walking around in a dream world, you know, baking
cakes,'' said Jacobs, 48, a resident of the Country Walk
subdivision southwest of Miami. ``What's the worst, you know, the
AC could go off?''
</P>
<P>
   The air conditioning did go off. So did part of the roof and one
wall.
</P>
<P>
   That's why on Wednesday, instead of icing cakes, Jacobs was
covering windows to prepare for Hurricane Georges. But oddly, only
the windows on the east side.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs partial reaction typefies, under one rebuilt roof, the
two currents of thought in Country Walk.
</P>
<P>
   Some homeowners have covered every opening but the front door.
Others, either for lack of time or interest, haven't touched a
hammer.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs also spoke for Country Walk back in 1992. Television's
Nightline program interviewed her family to put a human face on its
Andrew coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Country Walk's aerial profile _ street upon street of roofs
looking like scattered matchsticks _ became a familiar site to
Americans. But those ghostly photos had no people in them.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 1,000-plus homes in Country Walk were partially or
totally destroyed. Homeowners blamed the builder, Arvida, for
shoddy construction; the company later paid four-figure settlements
to each homeowner without admitting wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Jacobs' neighbor suffered the most damage on the
street, judging by Jacobs' photo collection. The same house had no
shutters or plywood on its windows Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The owner knows the risk. She was here in 1992, the owner's
brother said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said she's letting the insurance company take care of
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs said she assumed the strongest winds would come from the
east so that's where she put her shutters. Then Gary Putty, a
neighbor showed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a Category 3,'' said Putty, a contractor who lives
across the street, ``you're going to have to do the whole house.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The front, too?'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oy.''

 &HT;    Couch looks to pass test vs. Florida
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Ky. -- Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch would like to
forget his last visit to Florida Field.
</P>
<P>
   It was two years ago that Couch, then a freshman under former
Wildcats coach Bill Curry, made his first career start against
top-ranked Florida in Gainesville. Running an option offense, he
completed only six of 18 passes for 13 yards in the Gators' 65-0
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was running the option against the best team in the country,
and I wasn't an option quarterback,'' said Couch, who had broken
several national high-school passing records at Leslie County High
in Kentucky, ``I don't remember much about that game.''
</P>
<P>
   Wildcats fans don't recall it much, either, now that Couch is
rewriting the school and SEC record books in coach Hal Mumme's
pass-happy offense.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky's visit to eighth-ranked Florida on Saturday will go a
long way to show how far the Wildcats have come in two years under
Mumme, the former coach at Valdosta State.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can get a victory at Florida, I think it's going to put
this program over the hump,'' Couch said. ``It would put us in the
elite of the SEC and put us in contention for an SEC title.''
</P>
<P>
   An impressive outing against the Gators, ranked third nationally
in total defense, also would help the junior's Heisman Trophy
campaign tremendously.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nationally televised game against a high-ranked team,''
Couch said. ``It can help me if I play well and hurt me if I
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Couch, a 6-foot-5, 225-pound native of Hyden, Ky., finished
ninth in Heisman voting last year after throwing for 3,884 yards
and 37 touchdowns. In the latest poll of Heisman voters by Denver's
Rocky Mountain News, Couch is third behind quarterbacks Cade McNown
of UCLA and Donovan McNabb of Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I've told him about the Heisman is that there
are a lot more folks that haven't won it than those who have
actually won it,'' Kentucky quarterback coach Chris Hatcher said.
``I think anybody that plays in the position he does wants to be
known as the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Couch has done more than succeed as a quarterback in an offense
tailored to his skills. He also has helped Mumme rebuild
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky football. Last year, the Wildcats improved from 109th
to sixth in the nation in total offense, broke 51 school and 15 SEC
records and were called ``the most exciting 5-6 team in SEC
history'' by one publication.
</P>
<P>
   This year, season tickets are sold out, and by the beginning of
the 1999 season, capacity at Commonwealth Stadium will be increased
by almost 13,000 seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Mumme's) offense has proven itself over the years,'' Hatcher
said. ``But you've got to have a guy back there pulling the
trigger. Tim's the guy that makes this thing go.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher, who won the Harlan Hill Award _ the Division II
equivalent of the Heisman _ as Valdosta State's quarterback in
1994, already has watched one of his pupils drop from the top of
most Heisman lists. In 1996, Hatcher, a native of Macon, tutored
Central Florida star Daunte Culpepper, who managed just one
touchdown pass in a 35-7 loss at Purdue last week
</P>
<P>
   Couch's campaign nearly took a big hit last week as well.
Kentucky trailed Indiana 27-10 with less than six minutes left in
the third quarter, but a fake punt and an interception return
helped the Wildcats overcome perhaps Couch's worst performance as a
collegian. Couch completed 38 of 53 passes for 301 yards, but he
threw a career-high four interceptions. Mumme said Kentucky had
``24 plays where we had somebody make a critical error.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim didn't play very good in spots,'' Mumme said. ``Of those
24 plays, he's got about six of them that are his.''
</P>
<P>
   While Mumme's ``Air Raid'' offense hasn't been grounded _ the
Wildcats rank first nationally in total offense, averaging 50.3
points and 572.7 yards per game _ Kentucky has slowed down
somewhat. After throwing for 12 touchdowns in the first two games,
Couch threw only one against the Hoosiers. The Wildcats have just
four offensive touchdowns in their last six quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana played the equivalent of a prevent defense, using only
one linebacker and four down linemen to rush Couch. The Hoosiers
often used six defensive backs, allowing only screens and short
passes with different zone coverages.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did what Georgia did to us last year,'' Couch said.
``Keep everything in front, really take away the deep ball and make
us drive the field. I didn't adjust to it and got impatient. We're
going to see a lot of zones and people playing us the same way for
the rest of the year, so we might as well get ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida has perhaps the nation's best defensive front, with
tackles Reggie McGrew and Ed Chester and linebackers Johnny
Rutledge, Mike Peterson and Jevon Kearse. But the Gators are
inexperienced in the secondary, especially after the loss of
cornerback Tony George, who could sit out this week with sprained
knee ligaments. Florida is expected to start three first-year
full-time starters in the secondary _ cornerbacks Robert Cromartie
of Atlanta and Dock Pollard and strong safety Rod Graddy of
Cuthbert.
</P>
<P>
   Couch's immediate goal is to beat that secondary, but his
long-term plans are uncertain. ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper Jr.
says if Couch leaves Kentucky a year early, he could be the No. 1
quarterback chosen. Couch says he won't make a decision until after
this season, but he's shying away from a statement last month that
indicated he'd be back in Lexington next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have a pretty long period between the bowl game and the
time to declare for the draft to make my decision,'' Couch said.
``I don't think there's any more that I can accomplish (in
college), rather than just getting better at what I've done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about taking this program to a bowl-caliber level every
year and competing for an SEC championship. Until we get there, my
goals here aren't complete.''

 &HT;    ACC NOTES
 &HT;    By Norman Arey and Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEMSON vs. Wake Forest, Saturday, noon
</P>
<P>
   Five days after his team's emotionally draining 20-18 loss to
Virginia, head coach Tommy West still is being asked about his
outburst at QB Brandon Streeter on the last play of the game.
Television cameras showed a livid West screaming at Streeter for
throwing a Hail Mary pass in the end zone instead of a short pass
out of bounds to set up a possible winning field goal. ``It was the
emotion of wanting to win the football game. Whether it was the
right thing, I don't know,'' West said. Streeter said West
apologized and shrugged it off. ``It's kind of a shock for fans to
see it on TV,'' Streeter said. ``But it's an everyday thing. It
happens in practice a lot.'' ... An MRI on DL Adrian Dingle showed
no cartilage tear in his knee.
</P>
<P>
   DUKE vs. Virginia, Saturday, noon
</P>
<P>
   Head coach Fred Goldsmith, four of his assistants and 36 players
are still shaky from their bout with food poisoning that stuck
before, during and after a 62-13 loss to Florida State last
Saturday.... Now undefeated Virginia is coming to town _ a team the
Blue Devils played straight up last year before losing 13-10 in a
season that Duke finished with a 2-9 record. Virginia had to kick a
field goal with 2:31 left in the final quarter to salvage the win.
``We're not looking at this as a chance to redeem ourselves or as a
chance to get even,'' Goldsmith said. ``We just need to win,
period.''... Duke is currently nursing a 19-game losing streak in
the ACC _ a conference record. ``We're not thinking about the
streak,'' Goldsmith said. ``We're just thinking about winning. A
win will take care of the streak.''
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA STATE vs. USC, Saturday, 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The question isn't whether Duke gave FSU the bug that sidelined
the Seminoles' entire starting offensive line for Monday's
practice, but can the FSU linemen recovery in time to take on a
Southern Cal team that stacks up well against the Seminoles in the
talent department. ``Not much you can do,'' FSU coach Bobby Bowden
said.... Bowden admitted he was most worried about wideout Jay
Soward and linebacker Chris Claiborne. ... Bowden isn't happy with
his own star receiver, Peter Warrick. ``The thing that plagued him
last year is hurting him this year and that's dropping the ball on
the ones that he's open. He makes so many big plays, but he could
make more if he wouldn't drop the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   MARYLAND vs. Temple, Saturday, 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Terrapins have taken their lumps from two ranked teams the
last two weeks, giving up a total of 73 points to Virginia and West
Virginia. A number of lineup changes are in order, including at
quarterback, where starter Ken Mastrole and freshman Randall Jones
are being given an equal look. Mastrole was 3-for-9 for 27 yards
last week, while Jones threw for 70 yards and gained 49 rushing on
the option. ``We're not making a decision yet,'' head coach Ron
Vanderlinden said. ``I would think both will play.'' .... The
secondary also may be reworked, with three starting jobs up for
grabs, including those held by veterans Lynde Washington and Cliff
Crosby. . . . TB LaMont Jordan (scratched eye) is listed as
probable for Temple.
</P>
<P>
   NORTH CAROLINA vs. Ga. Tech, Saturday, 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Tar Heels have lost their first two games on the last play
of the game _- a 13-10 loss to Miami of Ohio and a 37-34 loss to
Stanford. The 37 points given up to Stanford was the most in four
years by a Heels defense. The defense can't stop anybody on
third-and-long. ... Ronald Curry, the starting quarterback, isn't
even on campus, as he went home after the death of his grandfather.
All-America defensive back Drey Bly is also missing due to the
death of his grandfather.... New head coach Carl Torbush has said
he's thinking about going up to the press box and coaching from
there if things don't get better. There was even talk of Carolina
changing its defensive scheme.N.C. STATE vs. Syracuse, Oct. 1, 8
p.m., ESPN
</P>
<P>
   The Wolfpack is getting out the publicity machine for WR Torry
Holt as a Heisman candidate and will be sending out weekly updates
to voters. Head coach Mike O'Cain said that, while he doesn't like
to single out individual players for awards, Holt's exploits
deserve consideration. Holt has scored four TDs, including a
68-yard punt return against Florida State, and has 23 receptions
for 462 yards. ``If I don't do it, then his chances aren't going to
be there,'' O'Cain said.... Even in N.C. State's roller-coaster
ride of a season thus far, Holt has been a constant. In last week's
33-30 loss to Baylor, he hauled in 11 passes for a school-record
225 yards. ... PK Scott Earwood is suffering from shin splints,
adding to an already unsettled kicking game for the Wolfpack. He's
questionable for next Thursday's game.
</P>
<P>
   VIRGINIA at Duke, Saturday, noon
</P>
<P>
   Last year against Duke, Virginia quarterback Aaron Brooks threw
three interceptions. Entering the game Saturday, he has tossed 165
passes in a row without an interception. ``I don't want to talk
about interceptions,'' coach George Welsh said. ``I don't like to
talk about them because they're going to come.''... Virginia,
undefeated at 3-0, hasn't been as impressive in its last two wins
as it was in its season-opening 19-0 victory over Auburn. ``We
played better against Auburn than we did the other two weeks,'' the
coach said. ``We just didn't play well in the second half against
Maryland or Clemson.''... The bad news for the Cavaliers is that
All-ACC cornerback candidate Dwayne Stukes is still nursing a knee
injury. Welsh says he's doubtful to see action in Durham.
</P>
<P>
   WAKE FOREST at Clemson, Saturday, noon
</P>
<P>
   The Deacons will have pre-season All-ACC first-team quarterback
Brian Kuklick 100 percent healthy for the first time this year
Saturday..... Although star linebacker Kelvin Moses (knee) isn't
expected to play, Kuklick has shed the brace he's been wearing on
his left knee after sprain in August... The Deacons face a very
tough game in Death Valley. Wake has won only once at Clemson since
1961, and that was Caldwell's first year in 1993. It also was his
first ACC win... Wake, after losing by a 42-0 score to Air Force
and awakening in the second half to overtake Navy 26-14, might seem
to be less than their pre-season No. 22 ranking by Sports
Illustrated might suggest, but Caldwell maintains that this is his
best team since he arrived and still thinks it will be.

 &HT;    Smoltz record at 17-3 after Braves roll 11-0
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The Braves departed south Florida after 48 short hours
that determined very little save this: October can't get here fast
enough for John Smoltz.
</P>
<P>
   While Gerald Williams, Andres Galarraga, George Lombard and Wes
Helms all homered and the Braves concluded their road schedule with
a 11-0 smear of the Florida Marlins, Smoltz made his final
appearance before Game One of the League Division Series. And
though these were only the Marlins, Smoltz let them have it.
</P>
<P>
   Improving his record to 17-3, Smoltz worked five tune-up innings
and allowed one single while striking out nine of the 17 men he
faced. Smoltz finished the season on a 12-1 tear and allowed just
six runs allowed in his last 42 innings (1.29 ERA), dating back
over six starts to Aug. 26. He struck out seven of the first 10
Marlins to bat, allowed only a single to Dave Berg and walked none
in a 67-pitch cruise.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the 89th credited to Atlanta's starters,
matching the total recorded by the 1990 Oakland A's for most by a
rotation this decade. The Braves also won for the 103rd time,
drawing them within one win of tying the franchise record. Their
road record of 50-31 was three shy of setting a team record.
</P>
<P>
   The team also reduced to one the magic number for clinching the
best record in the league, which would give the Braves home-field
advantage through the first two rounds of the season. That one-game
magic number was contingent to Houston's game at St. Louis later
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta ripped Marlins starter Kirt Ojala for four runs and nine
hits in the first four innings and then laid into the bullpen,
pounding reliever Eric Ludwick for five more in the fifth and
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Lombard, with just one single in his first five at-bats, opened
the eighth inning with a blast to deep right for his first major
league homer, estimated at 395 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga, playing in front of a Venezuela partisan crowd, ended
his home-run drought at 14 games with a solo shot off Ojala in the
fourth. That gave him 44, the most by a right-handed Brave since
Dale Murphy hit 44 in 1987. Ending a season-high span of 49 at-bats
without a homer, Galarraga heads into the final weekend of the
season three short of matching Hank Aaron's franchise record of 47.
The Braves scored in four of the first six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Williams continues to swing the hottest bat on the team with
five homers in his last seven starts and a .390 average in
September.

 &HT;    Roster moves for playoffs
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Postseason rosters do not have to be posted with the
National League until the day of the first playoff game, which
gives the Braves at least four more days to appraise the group it
will take into the division series.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost, the team must determine the physical conditions of
both shortstop Walt Weiss (left quadriceps) and second baseman
Keith Lockhart (right hamstring), which manager Bobby Cox will do
in the weekend series with the New York Mets. Both players are
expected to start Friday and play at least two games before the
club gets an accurate read on either's availability. Should
Lockhart have a setback, rookie Marty Malloy would be added to the
postseason roster. Cox is not interested in playing shortstop Ozzie
Guillen at second base. But if Weiss is sidelined, the club would
not take rookie Mike DeRosa, who has two September at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the starters, the 15 position players should
include reserve catcher Eddie Perez, outfielders Gerald Williams
and Danny Bautista with left-handed Curtis Pride and right-handed
Greg Colbrunn primary pinch-hitters.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to starting pitchers John Smoltz, Tom Glavine and
Greg Maddux, the tranfer of Denny Neagle and Kevin Millwood to the
bullpen leaves open five reliever spots. Three of the those go to
closer Kerry Ligtenberg, right-hander Rudy Seanez and left-hander
John Rocker. The two decisions remain: Dennis Martinez over Russ
Springer and rookie Odalis Perez over 35-year-old Norm Charlton.
</P>
<P>
   Expect Martinez to take the spot over Springer on the merits of
a 2.07 ERA in September and Springer's tender elbow that has
limited him to three September appearances. The left-hander
decision is between Charlton's experience (and a 1.69 ERA since
joining the club Aug. 11) and Perez's superior fastball and
breaking pitch.

   Taylor interviews
</P>
<P>
   Dean Taylor, Schuerholz's assistant GM, interviewed with
Baltimore Wednesday for the GM spot soon to be vacated by a
retiring Pat Gillick. Florida assistant GM Frank Wren, Cincinnati
GM Jim Bowden, and Cleveland assistant Dan O'Dowd are also in the
running.

<P>
   Heavy weather
</P>
<P>
   The Braves got out of town just in time Wednesday night.
Hurricane Georges is expected to make landfall at 8 a.m. Friday in
the Florida Keys but evacuation was in full progress when the team
bussed over the Pro Player Stadium. Several Braves _ Andres
Galarraga, Ryan Klesko and Martinez among them _ own houses in the
area but others have relatives who have already weathered the storm
in the Caribbean Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Bautista located his relatives in his native Domincan Republic
but Rafael Belliard is still waiting to hear from his, while Javy
Lopez has been unable to reach his family in Puerto Rico two days
after Georges passed through.

 &HT;    Glavine for Cy Young
 &HT;    By Tim Tucker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- If the National League Cy Young award were based on
the first half of the season, Greg Maddux would win it. If it were
based on the second half, John Smoltz would win it. If it were
based on the final two months, Randy Johnson would win it. And if
it were based on the ninth inning, Trevor Hoffman would win it.
</P>
<P>
   But because the Cy Young is based on the full season and the
full game, the winner should be ...
</P>
<P>
   Tom Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the obligatory, superficial case for his candidacy: He
has won more games than any other pitcher in the league (20), he
has lost fewer games (6) than anybody who is within two wins of
him, and he is fourth in the league in ERA (2.53). Those numbers
alone might carry the vote. But there is some strong competition,
so the electorate might need to look deeper.
</P>
<P>
   Look at Glavine's record after Atlanta losses: 11-2. He has made
it almost impossible for his team to have a losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Look at his record against the stronger opponents: 3-1 against
the Yankees, Astros and Padres. The rest of the Braves' staff is
7-11 against those teams.
</P>
<P>
   And look, at least in passing, at Glavine's importance in the
clubhouse. His leadership value can be quantified by the Braves'
10-2 record since Sept. 9, when he reminded the team in no
uncertain terms that it would be ousted from the playoffs quickly
if it didn't get its act together.
</P>
<P>
   There is another component to the vote, of course: the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen-game winners Kevin Tapani and Shane Reynolds aren't
serious candidates because their ERAs are too high; Smoltz and Al
Leiter aren't serious candidates because of the time they lost on
the disabled list. So Glavine's strongest competition among
starting pitchers will come from Maddux and the Padres' Kevin
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux continues to lead the league in ERA (2.24), but his 5-7
record in the second half has allowed Glavine to surpass him as the
Braves' leading candidate. Brown has a slightly lesser record than
Glavine (18-7, including 8-2 after San Diego losses) and a slightly
better ERA (2.36), and there is absolutely no reason not to vote
for him _ except that, when in doubt, go with the guy who has won
more games.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the wild card in the competition: Hoffman, the San
Diego closer who has had a phenomenal 51-save season.
</P>
<P>
   Eight relief pitchers have won Cy Young awards in the two
leagues, but the question remains difficult: How do you weigh a
reliever's candidacy against a starter's? For me, the burden of
proof is on the reliever; I'd vote for one only if his season were
head-and-shoulders above that of any starter.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the only two NL relievers to win the Cy Young since
1980. Steve Bedrosian won in '87, when the league had no 20-game
winners and only one starter with an ERA under 3.00 (Nolan Ryan,
whose record was 8-16). Mark Davis won in '89, when none of the
league's top five winners ranked among the top five in ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine simply has had too good a season _ too complete a season
_ for a relief pitcher to win the Cy Young this year.
</P>
<P>
   He has had too good a season for anyone else to win it.

 &HT;    SEC Notes
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart and Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALABAMA at Arkansas, Saturday, 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Fullback/tailback Montoya Madden has returned to practice for
the first time since the preseason. Madden did not not play in 1997
because of a bad back. His status for Saturday's game had not been
determined. ... Wide receiver Shamari Buchanan, who has a fractured
collarbone, will miss Saturday's game and two more weeks. ...
Alabama leads the SEC in sacks with 14. ... Junior-college transfer
Todd Whitmore is expected to be redshirted this season. After a
short experiment at offensive line Whitemore had been moved back to
defense. . . . Coach Mike DuBose said he's not concerned about his
team looking ahead to its Oct. 3 game against Florida. ``We've lost
to Arkansas two out of the last three years,'' DuBose said. ``If we
overlook anybody, I'll be surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   ARKANSAS vs. Alabama, Saturday, 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Hogs romped to an easy win over SMU last week,
coach Houston Nutt was concerned that his players enjoyed
themselves too much when scoring: The Razorbacks were penalized
three times for a total of 45 yards for excessive celebration after
touchdowns. .. Tailback Madre Hill has fumbled twice in 20 carries
this season. He had just one fumble in 381 previous carries before
his knee injuries. But the running game, dead last in the SEC last
year, has turned around. Arkansas leads with an average of 214.5
yards a game on the ground. ... QB Clint Stoerner threw for a
career-high three TDs, and WR Anthony Lucas is averaging 30.4 yards
a catch and 105.5 a game. ... Next week's game with Kentucky has
been moved to 6 p.m. and will be shown on ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   AUBURN vs. Tennessee, Oct. 3
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Heath Evans, who is out for the season with a broken
ankle, is the fifth offensive starter lost since spring practice.
The others are WR Robert Baker (dismissed), center T.J.Dunigan
(quit) and guards T.J. Mears (quit) and Mike Pucillo (injured). ...
With Evans' injury, Roman Nelsen is the starter, and Tellie Embry
becomes the backup. True freshman Curtis Lee and redshirt freshman
quarterback Meiko Collier are competing for the No. 3 job. ...
Coach Terry Bowden, whose team is 1-2 with a week off, has asked
his players to remain positive ... Bowden scheduled scrimmages for
Wednesday and Thursday in order to look at some younger players.
... Auburn's schedule has been rated the nation's toughest by the
NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA vs. Kentucky, Saturday, 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Steve Spurrier said he will continue to juggle his
quarterbacks in Saturday's game with Kentucky. Sophomore Jesse
Palmer and junior Doug Johnson combined to complete 31 of 49 passes
for 401 yards in the 20-17 overtime loss to Tennessee. However, he
said that he might not alternate them on every play. ... Guard
Cheston Blackshear had surgery to repair a broken bone in his right
hand. He will be replaced by junior Cooper Carlise. Blackshear
might be back for Florida's game at Alabama on Oct. 3. ... The
sprained knee of cornerback Tony George is not as serious as
previously thought. He might play in Saturday. ... Tailback Eugene
McCaslin will play Saturday after a three-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   KENTUCKY at Florida, Saturday, 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats have been spending most of the week harking back to
last year's Florida contest, even though Kentucky is coming off a
31-27 win over Indiana. The Gators scored the first four TDS en
route to a 55-28 win, but Kentucky had four TDs in the last three
quarters. ``The second half last year was the reason we beat
Alabama the next week,'' coach Hal Mumme said. ``That gave us a lot
of confidence.'' ... Kentucky's 3-0 start is its best since 1984,
and the No. 25 Wildcats are ranked for the first time since that
season. ... Quarterback Tim Couch, who was intercepted four times
last week, was vulnerable to the Hoosiers using a linebacker on
passing coverage, forcing him to throw shorter routes. He's
expecting to see more of the same from Florida.
</P>
<P>
   LSU vs. Idaho, Saturday, 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Kevin Faulk needs just 505 yards to become the
all-time leading rusher in LSU history. With 3,546 yards, he trails
only Dalton Hilliard (4,050) and Charles Alexander (4,035). ...
Faulk needs only 620 all-purpose yards to become the SEC's all-time
leader, passing Herschel Walker's 5,749. ... A win over Idaho
Saturday night would give Herb ler 26 career victories as the
Tigers' starting quarterback. Tommy Hodson (1986-89) is LSU's
all-time leader with 31 wins. ... Tyler was named the SEC offensive
player of the week after three touchdown passes and one touchdown
rushing against Auburn. ... LSU ranks No. 1 in four categories in
the SEC _ rushing defense (32 yards a game), kickoff return (39.5
avg.), punt returns (18.7 ypr), and opponent first downs allowed
(25).
</P>
<P>
   MISSISSIPPI at SMU, Saturday, 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore lineman Terrence Metcalf, who started all 12 games
last year, will miss the rest of the season after surgery to repair
a fractured ankle. Metcalf broke his left ankle on the first play
of last Saturday's 30-6 win over Vanderbilt when running back Joe
Gunn rolled onto it. School officials say they will apply for a
medical redshirt year after the season is over. Junior Mitch Baker
will start in Metcalf's place. ... Assistant coach Hugh Nall, a
former player at Georgia, is back with the team after missing last
week's game having his appendix removed. Defensive lineman Derrick
Burgess continues to struggle with tendon problems in his knee. ...
Cornerbacks Gary Thigpen and Timothy Strickland are hobbled by bad
ankles but are expected to play.
</P>
<P>
   MISSISSIPPI STATE at S. Carolina, Saturday, 12:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Barrin Simpson, the Bulldogs' leading tackler, has a
torn meniscus in his right knee and will be out until at least the
Auburn game Oct. 10. ... Head coach Jackie Sherrill said he won't
decide on a starting QB until kickoff. Starter Matt Wyatt had a
miserable game, going 1-for-5 for 4 yards and an interception. He
had been platooning with Wayne Madkin, but the position is now up
for grabs. ... RB James Johnson had just 38 yards in 13 carries
against the Cowboys, who tore up MSU's defense for 561 total yards,
the most since Barry Sanders starred at Oklahoma State. . . . Kevin
Prentiss had three receptions for 105 yards, but no one else
totaled more than 33 yards. ``We have to do a better job of getting
the ball to our receivers,'' Sherrill said.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH CAROLINA vs. Miss. St., Saturday, 12:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   After missing the opener, running back Troy Hambrick has rushed
for 224 yards in two games. Hambrick can't celebrate because the
Gamecocks are 1-2 and facing a must-win situation Saturday at home
against Mississippi State. ``We got to get it,'' Hambrick said. ``I
don't care how we get it, by one point or a half-point if possible.
We need this bad.'' ... Mississippi State has been a thorn in South
Carolina's side, winning three of the last four meetings. ... South
Carolina has the 10th worst turnover margin in the SEC, with nine
turnovers and only five takeaways. ...The Gamecocks committed four
turnovers in their 24-21 loss to Marshall. ... Despite injuries in
the secondary, South Carolina is second in the SEC in pass defense.
But the Gamecocks are 11th in the league in rushing defense.
</P>
<P>
   TENNESSEE vs. Houston, Saturday, 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Note to Tennessee quarterback Tee Martin: UCLA's Cade McNown
says Houston plays dirty. ``I felt like they played us dirty, a lot
of cheap shots, a lot of going for knees, late hits.'' Houston
(0-3) plays at Tennessee on Saturday night. Houston coach Kim
Helton said UCLA, which won 42-24, started it. ``We pride ourselves
on being a very clean football team,'' Helton said. ``But if you
slap us in the face, we'll slap you back.'' Tennessee coach Phillip
Fulmer said he had talked to Helton this week about the situation.
``There were several things in the UCLA game that I know neither
team is proud of,'' Fulmer said. ``Coach Helton and I talked about
it, and neither of us expects it to happen in our game.'' ...
Linebacker Al Wilson caused three Florida fumbles last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   VANDERBILT at TCU, Oct. 3
</P>
<P>
   After a 30-6 loss to Ole Miss, head coach Woody Widenhofer still
believes his team can have a ``good season.'' The Commodores are
0-3, with all three losses to SEC teams, and its proud defense has
been ripped apart. Vandy surrendered 383 yards to a Rebel offense
shut down the week before by Auburn. ``We need to play a whole
game. We play three good quarters, and then we self-destruct,''
Widenhofer said. ``A lot of it is that we're young, but we can't
use that as an excuse. I think we're going to have a good season.
You guys (media) probably think I'm crazy, but I have a lot of
confidence in these players.'' ... Widenhofer said he hasn't
decided whether to redshirt freshman WR Anthony Jones because he
might be able to push the veterans.

 &HT;    FAMU QB Morand will be idle for Classic
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Less than a month ago, it appeared that Florida A&AMP;M
would be coming to town to face Tennessee State in the 10th Annual
Atlanta Football Classic at the Georgia Dome (4 p.m. Saturday) with
former Southwest DeKalb High backup quarterback Micheal Morand
leading its offense.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the sophomore who backed up Georgia's Quincy
Carter in high school, the defense of No. 5-ranked Hampton
short-circuited his tenure as a starter. Morand was ineffective in
a 21-14 loss to the Pirates in Tallahassee three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's moved the ball better than either of the other four
quarterbacks on our roster, so we decided he should be our
starter,'' Rattlers coach Billy Joe said. Last week, Bonner
completed 30 of 35 passes for 343 yards and three touchdowns in a
45-7 rout of Jackson State.
</P>
<P>
   Joe's decision to start Bonner instead of North Carolina State
transfer Jose Laureano or Morand, sets up a matchup of quarterbacks
who transferred from struggling Division I-A programs on the East
Coast. Bonner transferred from Temple, while Tennessee State
sophomore Leon Murray transferred from Pitt.
</P>
<P>
   The game also will feature two of the most prolific receivers in
I-AA _ FAMU sophomore Jacquay Nunnally and TSU's Tyrone
Butterfield. The two receivers come into the game as I-AA's No. 1
and No. 4 leaders in receiving yards.
</P>
<P>
   Flashback
</P>
<P>
   When Tennessee State appeared in Atlanta Classic VII against
South Carolina State in '94, the Tigers were led by Bill Davis, who
was going against a coach and friend who gave him his first job at
the collegiate level. Saturday in Orangeburg, S.C., Davis and South
Carolina State coach Willie Jeffries will meet as foes again.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, fired at TSU after the '95 season, is in his second year
as the head coach at Johnson C. Smith, his alma mater. Saturday's
trip to Orangeburg will be a homecoming of sorts for him, because
he replaced Jeffries as the Bulldogs' coach _ after Jeffries made
history by taking the job at Wichita State in 1979 and becoming the
first black to head a I-A program.
</P>
<P>
   Heritage bowl watch
</P>
<P>
   Defending MEAC champion Hampton (3-0), which already has cleared
three of its four major hurdles to another conference title, by
beating FAMU, Howard and North Carolina A&AMP;T, inadvertently is
giving some shape to McDonald's Heritage Bowl VIII.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, almost certain to eliminate itself from bowl
consideration by making the I-AA playoff field, has opened the door
to the Dec. 26 matchup of SWAC and MEAC representatives to such
teams as Howard (2-1), North Carolina A&AMP;T (2-1) and South Carolina
State (1-1) on the MEAC side. The assumption is that FAMU will keep
rolling and gain another berth in the playoff. At this point,
Southern is the top bowl candidate from the SWAC.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, which faces Doug Williams' Grambling at Giants Stadium
in East Rutherford, N.J., on Saturday, features three players from
Redan High _ starting quarterback Roy Johnson, wideout Warren
Broughton and defensive tackle Jason Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling the heat
</P>
<P>
   If any coach is on the ``hot seat'' yet, it is Jackson State
coach James Carson. The Tigers (0-3) are off to their worst start
in 29 years entering Saturday's game against rival Mississippi
Valley State. Evidence of fan discontent was shown last weekend,
when only 13,500 showed up to watch the team suffer a 45-7
shellacking by Florida A&AMP;M. That was 24,500 fewer than last year's
average home attendance and 25,000 less than the two teams drew
when they played in Jackson in '96. The fortunes of Mississippi
Valley State, also 0-3, haven't been any better.

 &HT;    Falcons' West Coast puzzle
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- George Sefcik is the Atlanta Falcons running backs
coach, but he may have had the best answer Wednesday on how to slow
the San Francisco 49ers' West Coast offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take it to Buffalo in January,'' Sefcik said.
</P>
<P>
   But the way the 49ers have played in their first two games, bad
weather might not matter.
</P>
<P>
   When the Falcons (2-0) play San Francisco (2-0) on Sunday,
they'll try to slow a team that has produced more than 1,000 yards
of offense in two games.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Steve Young's throwing elbow is healthy for the
first time in nearly a year. Wide receiver Jerry Rice back is in
the picture after missing most of last season with an injured knee,
and former University of Georgia running back Garrison Hearst is
averaging an NFL-best 167.5 rushing yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're mixing the run and the pass as well as I've ever seen
that offense do it,'' Falcons defensive coordinator Rich Brooks
said.
</P>
<P>
   That's saying something. San Francisco has had a lot of very
good offenses since 1979, when Bill Walsh took over as coach and
installed the short passing game based on timing and runs after the
catch. The 49ers have won five Super Bowls starting with the 1981
season, and the offense survived Walsh's departure after the '88
season _ two of the titles came after he left.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons backup Steve DeBerg was Walsh's first starting
quarterback (1979-'80) in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The offense) was new to us, but Bill Walsh was the best I
ever saw at explaining a play,'' DeBerg said. ``He explained it in
such detail that you felt as if you were experiencing it.
Sometimes, when he'd first draw up a play, you'd go, `What in the
world is that?' By the time he was done explaining it, you
completely understood it. He was a great teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it's a timing passing game _ get a lot of receivers
out quickly, make fast reads and try to eliminate sacks. In the
beginning, Bill had to emphasize to quarterbacks that throwing the
ball to a running back on a short pass on first down was an
extension of the running game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He emphasized to me to try to throw the ball downfield on
first down, but if (there's not a deep receiver open), immediately
dump it (short). Even a five-yard completion is like a successful
run play.''
</P>
<P>
   Falcons cornerback Ray Buchanan, among others, will have a tough
job. He is 5 feet 9, 195 pounds, and the three primary 49ers
receivers are big _ Jerry Rice (6-2, 196), Terrell Owens (6-3,
217), and J.J. Stokes (6-4, 223).
</P>
<P>
   Much of the 49ers' offense is about creating mismatches _
flooding zones or getting running backs on linebackers who can't
keep up. Last year, 49ers running backs had 259 receiving yards in
two victories against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put (defenders) in terrible situations where they have to
think a lot and make fast decisions,'' Buchanan said. ``A lot of
times, they want to hit guys running in stride where they can make
yards after the catch.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamming receivers to disrupt their timing is critical, Buchanan
said, and Brooks agreed that making tackles and playing physically
are essential for the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're out of position or miss a tackle, it turns a 6- or
7-yard gain into a bigger one,'' he said. ``And the 49ers receivers
have a size advantage over virtually every secondary. You do have a
mismatch on jump balls and balls thrown high.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 49ers use that size very well. The receivers get their
bodies into position where the DB has to come through them, and the
smaller the DB, the harder that is. That's one of the reasons they
run a lot of inside slant routes, so they can position the
receivers inside the smaller DBs.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the matter of the 49ers' running game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their running game is more horizontal than vertical,'' Brooks
said. ``Hearst might go almost all the way to one sideline and then
cut back completely across the field. And a lot of their
play-action fakes come off their best running plays.''
</P>
<P>
   If the 49ers are succeeding with the run and the short passing
game, the Falcons need to be careful about sneaking defenders up to
the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another thing (Walsh) always taught was that when you use your
backs ... as the game progresses the linebackers (and safeties)
start coming up,'' DeBerg said. ``And then when the game is on the
line in the fourth quarter, now you're able to throw it downfield
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's Young, who makes great decisions and is one of
the most dangerous scramblers in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a guy executing the offense who's been doing it
forever and just does a great job,'' Brooks said. ``It's amazing
what he does, not only with his arm, but with his legs.''

 &HT;    ABL takes different tact
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Picking at a pasta lunch in a Midtown restaurant,
Boky Vidic is lamenting the demise of her basketball team, the
Atlanta Glory of the American Basketball League. She and Terese,
her companion of three years, face a move to the Pacific Northwest
so Vidic can play for the Seattle Reign, which picked her up in a
dispersal draft after the Glory folded.
</P>
<P>
   Vidic said she will miss Atlanta and the Glory, a box-office
bust in spite of a strong following in the lesbian community.
</P>
<P>
   And she will miss the comfort zone that she found here.
</P>
<P>
   But Vidic cannot complain about her next destination. In
Seattle, the Reign send players to speak at lesbian functions, mix
in Indigo Girls music during games and have participated in
postgame parties at a local lesbian-oriented club, The Wild Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Reign officials say they think that lesbians account for more
than half of their 1,500 season tickets sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``If lesbians are a large portion of our fan base, then
naturally that's going to be represented in what we do, because we
listen to our fans,'' Reign general manager Karen Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we're consciously going after them, but they
happen to make up a large part of the women's basketball community
across the country _ whether it be college, pro or otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Vidic, a guard from Croatia, suggests that all women's sports
face up to the fact that they are overlooking a significant
clientele by not marketing to lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the lesbians love to see females performing out
there,'' said Vidic, who last year persuaded ABL officials to
insert a clause in player contracts prohibiting racial and sexual
discrimination and is now pushing for medical benefits for
unmarried partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you see at baseball games or football games? It's
usually men, or most of the same kind of people. Now, women's
basketball games are not all women, but it is the majority. And it
is the lesbian community. It's like a big celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   ABL teams, individually and collectively, are taking an
unprecedented approach among women's sports organizations by
reaching out to lesbian fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's be direct: Is the lesbian community part of the ABL
audience? Yes, of course. They're good, enthusiastic fans,'' said
league co-founder and CEO Gary Cavalli, who estimates the portion
at 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Portland, the Power advertise and run promotions in ``Just
Out,'' a local gay-and-lesbian publication. In San Jose, the Lasers
set up a booth at a gay-and-lesbian festival.
</P>
<P>
   The Glory took a similar proactive stance. My Sister's Room, a
popular Midtown lesbian nightspot, evolved into an unofficial
hangout for some Glory team members and fans, with player
autographs and posters displayed behind the bar. The bar sponsored
a beer-on-the-bus trip to a game at Morehouse College, and the
Glory sold discounted tickets and merchandise there.
</P>
<P>
   The Glory contracted with local ad agency Mind Power, run by
lesbian partners Libbie Turner and Donna Bowling, and advertised
regularly in Southern Voice, a gay-and-lesbian publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a good, solid following for us,'' said Glory
general manager D.J. Mackovets, who concluded after taking two
informal surveys that lesbians comprised 20 percent of the fan
base. ``We were cognizant that the lesbian community was a strength
for us, and it was part of our marketing plan from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the main objects of the ABL is young girls coming to
our basketball games, so you have to strike the balance between
attracting that part of the core-mission statement and, in this
market, a strong lesbian following.''
</P>
<P>
   It is virtually unheard of for men's sports teams to reach out
to gay communities.

 &HT;    Sexuality can be sensitive issue in recruiting
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The subject crops up early in the recruiting process.
A female high school athlete, or mom or dad, will raise it to a
college coach.
</P>
<P>
   Are there lesbians on your team? On your coaching staff?
</P>
<P>
   If so, does it cause problems?
</P>
<P>
   How do you deal with it?
</P>
<P>
   Andy Landers, longtime women's basketball coach at the
University Georgia, says the topic is brought up with about half of
the players he recruits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sexuality thing is a very important issue,'' Landers said.
``You hear comments like, 'We've just been really turned off at
some of the AAU tournaments by the way some of the (women) look and
dress. We're just really concerned about that.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That could be a parent, that could be a kid. But they want you
to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Landers says he declines to answer directly to avoid being
labeled as homophobic or as someone who runs a program that goes
out of its way to welcome lesbian players and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   How should a coach respond? ``Most don't even know (about their
players' sexuality),'' said Betty Jaynes, CEO of the 4,000-plus
member Women's Basketball Coaches Association. ``It's such a
sensitive issue that they take it just like religion: You're not
really supposed to ask.''
</P>
<P>
   Some coaches are not neutral. Penn State's Rene Portland once
said she does not want lesbians on her team, a declaration that
sparked gay-rights advocates to demonstrate at games and outside
her house. They tied up telephone lines and occupied the school's
administration building in protest. Penn State has since instituted
a university-wide policy against discrimination based on sexual
orientation, and Portland refuses to discuss the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Other programs tend to be classified as consciously welcoming
lesbian players, sometimes by rival coaches engaging in gutter
recruiting tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Two campuses this past spring felt the sting from the issue.
Southern Colorado basketball coach Sherry Winn survived an ouster
attempt by half of her roster because of her perceived sexual
orientation, a controversy that she believes cost her three
recruits who went elsewhere. LSU softball coach Cathy Compton
wasn't so lucky, losing her job in part because of an ``unhealthy
relationship'' with one of her players, according to athletics
director Joe Dean.
</P>
<P>
   Recruitment of top athletes long has been the life blood of
men's college athletics, but rarely does a high school boy or his
parents express concern about whether a program welcomed homosexual
athletes or discouraged them from enrolling.
</P>
<P>
   For the women, it's a different story, as parents and their
children deal with reality and perception _ in some cases,
misperception _ about what it means to play for a lesbian coach and
play alongside a lesbian athlete.
</P>
<P>
   `Now, straight girls play sports'
</P>
<P>
   When Chris Gobrecht reflects on growing up in Huntington Beach,
Calif., in the early 1970s, she pictures the afternoons on her
driveway, draining jump shots while nervously peering over her
shoulder to see who might be watching.
</P>
<P>
   At 15, she loved the sport. But Gobrecht, now the women's head
coach at Southern Cal, kept her game secret for fear of being seen
as unladylike.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just the perception that I would be less desirable to a
man,'' said Gobrecht, who is married and the mother of two. ``I
didn't want to be seen as taking it seriously. So if I was
shooting, I would go hide if I saw a car come around the corner. I
cared what the opposite sex thought of me, and I felt I had to hide
my sports interest.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, girls involved in sports often drew smirks and
wisecracks. They were called everything from the benign ``tomboy''
to the derogatory ``butch'' _ and worse. ``You're told by _ in most
cases, mean-spirited people _ that you look like a boy,'' said
Teresa Edwards, former University of Georgia star and four-time
Olympian. ``Or you're acting like a boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some young women heard crazy notions about why they should stay
out of sports. You'll get bulging muscles. You're frail and you'll
get hurt. You won't be able to have babies.
</P>
<P>
   Those distortions have not disappeared. Pro basketball star
Rebecca Lobo remembers first hearing her sexuality questioned on a
Springfield, Mass., playground the summer before her sophomore year
of high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``This girl on the other team called me a 'dyke,''' recalled
Lobo, who is heterosexual. ``I had to ask my mother what it was.
She laughed, and said it was another word for 'lesbian.' She said,
'You're scoring on her so she had to call you a name.' `` How
people deal with lesbians in women's sports, as they continue to
flourish, probably will become an issue, because most parties agree
that their numbers are significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be ridiculous to try and dispute that,'' said Kate
Kendell, executive director of the National Center for Lesbian
Rights.
</P>
<P>
   If disproportionate numbers of lesbians have found comfort in
athletics, it's because most women historically were discouraged
from participating and many who did were already social outcasts,
say women who have studied the history of sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``In part, being lesbian means living against the tide, and
living against a stereotypical gender role,'' Kendall said.
``Complementary of that is choosing a career or activities that are
not rigidly gender-type.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stereotypes about why lesbians prefer certain things and gay
men prefer certain things start with some germ of truth. It clearly
appears to be the case, at least anecedotally for me and my
friends, that many more lesbians like sports than do my gay male
friends. Part of it is aptitude, part is not buying into
traditional gender type and part is that unknown biological,
genetic, scientific question of how the genes are formed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariah Burton Nelson, a former basketball player and the author
of several books on the subject of lesbianism in sports, said, ``It
used to be, in the old days, that in order to play sports you had
to be willing to buck huge social trends. You had to be willing to
put up with a lot of pressure and social stigma. In the '40s and
'50s, and even the '60s, lesbians were willing to do that. So those
brave lesbian women opened the doors, made it socially acceptable
for women in general to play sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, straight girls play sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Conflict causing polarization
</P>
<P>
   With the enactment of Title IX legislation a quarter-century ago
that outlawed gender discrimination in schools that receive federal
funds, women's sport is attracting from a wider group. Increased
participation has helped soften the stereotype of the female
athlete, and studies reveal that girls who participate have greater
self-esteem and confidence.
</P>
<P>
   While girls are benefiting from sports, conflicts over
lesbianism could become a deterrent to growth. When all women need
to be working in conjunction to promote their sport, a coach or
athlete's sexual orientation can be divisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``My real beef is the polarization that I see it causing,'' said
Gobrecht, who welcomed a lesbian booster club when she coached at
Washington. ``We don't want to polarize our fans, our coaches, our
athletes. We're choosing up sides, and it's a real threat to our
profession.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fellowship of Christian Athletes set up a booth at the
women's NCAA Final Four in April, passed out brochures and, when
asked, expanded on the group's sexual-purity statement. The FCA
considers any homosexual activity unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   FCA director of national programs Julie Brown, a former
assistant coach at Florida State and Tulsa, said she has counseled
lesbian players who have become ``too wrapped up in a
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   To some, the lesbian label is simply a tactic used by a
male-dominated society to keep women from invading what was once an
all-guys sports fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   Jaynes said she is shocked at comments she hears in meetings
with influential leaders of men's college basketball. She refused
to name names.
</P>
<P>
   ``They basically say, '(Lesbianism) is a terrible thing to be in
women's sports.' Or, 'Why can't we get rid of them?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never expect them to make those blanket comments about
blacks or Asians. If you look at attendance of women's basketball,
sponsorship and money generated, (lesbianism) hasn't hurt women's
basketball that much. But ... with some of the high-profile males,
I can't do anything to change their minds. They're too set in their
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Because lesbianism in sports is largely closeted, when it
bubbles over to the public, it often creates uneasiness.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, University of South Carolina coach Pam Parsons was
pressured to resign after a Sports Illustrated article revealed her
relationship with player Tina Buck, a graduate of the former
Briarcliff High in DeKalb County. Parsons sued the magazine and
lost. She and Buck later were convicted of perjury. Such cases
instill concerns that young athletes could be ``seduced'' by
lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Flynn, coach of a Philadelphia-based women's AAU team and
operator of a recruiting service, says parents would be shocked if
they knew what awaited their daughters when they arrive on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pervasive and extensive, and you either walk away or
accept it,'' Flynn said. ``I tell kids it's not about the coach
being gay, it's about whether your teammates are and whether
they're going to come after you.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're around this four years non-stop, there is a certain
amount of pressure. It's one thing to come out, another to have a
gauntlet of lesbians leading you down the path.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say such fears are unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the stereotype is out there, but parents
shouldn't have a fear that, if their daughter plays sports, they'll
turn into a lesbian,'' Lobo said.
</P>
<P>
   Winn, the Southern Colorado coach, finds the notion that women
are ``recruited'' into a lesbian lifestyle as preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't exist,'' she said. ``Young women don't go away to
college and make a decision to become lesbians. But at college,
they often have opportunity to discover who they are because they
have left home _ whether it's to drink or not, whether to make a
decision to have sex with a partner or not, whether they change
their religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things happen when young men and young women go to
college, and they get freedom to experience who they are. And it
doesn't have anything to do with recruiting. Sexual preference is
not a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Down-and-dirty recruiting tactics
</P>
<P>
   Some heterosexual players say lesbians at least can make them
feel uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   It was a rude awakening for Gergana Branzova when a few of her
Florida International basketball teammates expressed an attraction
and asked her for a date. Branzova had come from Bulgaria, where
she says lesbianism in sport is not as prevalent and where
homosexuality carries more stigma than in the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to be very straightforward,'' said Branzova, a
first-round pick of the WNBA's Detroit Shock. ``I said, 'Listen, I
can be your friend as long you don't touch me.' There has to be a
boundary, a certain distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, then, we became good friends. I respect what they are.
... It's funny now. Then, it was scary.'' Pat Griffin, a lesbian
activist, says the worried athletes and parents are dreaming up a
``lesbian bogeywoman,'' a sexual predator.
</P>
<P>
   What's a father to do? Harvey Catchings, whose daughters Tamika
(Tennessee) and Tauja (Illinois) are college standouts, is
sensitive to the world his daughters inhabit, one in which he
believes lesbanism is ``pretty prevalent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been able to handle it,'' Catchings said, ``because
they say, 'I've got to play with these people on the court. When
I'm off the court, then it's my choice.' It's no different than
when I played in the NBA. You may not have liked everybody on the
team, but you had to function as a unit.''
</P>
<P>
   Another unfortunate trend of big-time men's sports is negative
recruiting, but nothing has approached the down-and-dirty tactic of
coaches painting their rivals of being a ``lesbian'' program.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Texas has been so tagged since the early
1990s, in part because current WNBA star Sheryl Swoopes quit the
program days into her freshman year, reportedly because she was
bothered by the presence of lesbians on the team. Coach Jody
Conradt was ambushed on the recruiting trail after Swoopes
defected. The Lady Longhorns fell out of favor with state high
school coaches and coveted players, and Texas has disappeared from
the national picture, failing to contend for an NCAA title since
1989.
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes says now she left to be closer to home, but the rumor
lives on, as does the label.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge problem,'' said Griffin, a University of
Massachusetts professor and author of ``Strong Women, Deep Closets:
Lesbians and Homophobia in Sport.'' ``You know there are lesbian
athletes and coaches, and there is no one who feels safe enough to
be publicly visible. So you have a lot of negative recruiting that
coaches do, trying to slander rival teams by telling a prospective
athlete there are lesbians on the team or the coach is a lesbian.''
</P>
<P>
   Ex-NBA player Jim Chones has a daughter, Kareeda, who just
finished her career at Marquette, and another, Kaayla, a
high-school senior and a top recruit. He perceives the lesbian
label as nothing more than ``scare tactics,'' another instance of a
coach using any means possible to gain an edge.
</P>
<P>
   When Kaayla makes her college decision, he says, it'll come down
to the prospects for winning games and titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it like this _ it's in our society,'' Chones said.
``I'm not going to go out there and make judgments against somebody
because of their lifestyle. All I hope and pray is that my daughter
will be the best person she can be. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Like my oldest daughter says, 'Dad, you just can't run from
it. It's everywhere in society. But what I found out, Dad, is a lot
of them are good people. They're just trying to make a living. And
they may have a preference, but it doesn't necessarily mean I'm
like them or they're like me. But we respect each other and we have
a common goal _ to win.' ``

   Boky Vidic, 25, is a pro basketball player in the ABL who was
with the former Atlanta Glory last season. She talks about fitting
in as a lesbian athlete in America.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Growing up in Croatia, lesbianism wasn't really an
issue to me. I really never talked about it to anybody. I wasn't
aware such a thing existed, even though it was going through my
head and everything. I heard just one time the word ``lesbian.'' I
was 19.
</P>
<P>
   Then, I came to the United States, and there is all this talk,
the activism, the feminism, the lesbian community. And I was, like,
``Wow!'' It was a little shocking at first, because it was so
different. It made magic. It gave me a spark and a different look.
</P>
<P>
   This was at Oregon State, in a tiny college town. The university
tends to open your eyes and everything, and I was involved in a lot
of activism out there, especially my junior and senior year, as far
as getting the athletic program to deal with homophobia, the racism
and classism that was going on.
</P>
<P>
   It was really hard for the athletics department. I guess I was
the first one to be really open about their sexuality. A lot of
athletes were in the same position I was in, but they weren't quite
sure what they wanted. They weren't sure how society was going to
react or think.
</P>
<P>
   When I played with the pro team in Atlanta, the other players
didn't care. I don't even know that half of them knew.
</P>
<P>
   I personally don't have a problem saying that I have a (female)
lover. Some players are like, ``How can you be out?'' I'm, like,
``Why not? It's me.''

 &HT;    WNBA puts its focus on `feminine' athletes
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- When Sheryl Swoopes' team plays on television, the
cameras manage to find her husband Eric and son Jordan in the
stands. In some of her TV commercials and print ads, there is no
mistaking the fact that Swoopes is an athlete, a wife and a mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's so important is that little girls know _ and I'm sure
they've heard a lot of stereotypes _ it's OK to be a really good
athlete,'' said Swoopes, the Women's National Basketball
Association star for the Houston Comets who once was hyped as the
female Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm on the court, I take care of business,'' she said in
an interview, ``but I don't have to be a big bully. It's important
for us to get that message out, that they see the other side of
female athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the message might not be intentional, the WNBA shows in
its promotions the so-called feminine side of its three star
players. Besides Swoopes, who reportedly left the University of
Texas because she felt uncomfortable around lesbian players there,
the league spotlights Rebecca Lobo and Lisa Leslie, a part-time
model.
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA is based in New York and spends $15 million on slick
and tried-but-true marketing methods (''We Got Next'') borrowed
from the NBA, its overseer. The rival ABL, based in Palo Alto,
Calif., has been likened to a Silicon Valley start-up firm, with a
thrift-store budget.
</P>
<P>
   Although both leagues draw from a diverse population _everyone
from suburban dads with their school-age daughters to female
couples _ WNBA franchises don't advertise in the gay media or
market to a lesbian audience. The ABL does.
</P>
<P>
   A WNBA souvenir on toy shelves says it all: a Basketball Barbie
doll.
</P>
<P>
   To Mariah Burton Nelson, a former player and activist author,
the WNBA's marketing intentions are clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're featuring the heterosexual players and sending out a
message,'' Nelson said. ``Their fingernails, their makeup, their
boyfriends, their modeling, their babies. 'Look at us, can't you
see we're heterosexual and isn't it great that we play sports now?'
``
</P>
<P>
   Nelson cited a flashback she had to her time in the short-lived
Women's Pro Basketball League. In 1979, management for the
California Dreams in Los Angeles sent players to the John Robert
Powers Modeling &AMP; Acting charm school. ``They wanted to present a
heterosexual, feminine image,'' she said, ``to cover up the fact
that many of us were lesbians.''
</P>
<P>
   University of Washington follower Molly O'Neill, who co-founded
``Husky Hoops,'' a lesbian fan club for the women's basketball
team, said she is grateful that the ABL's Reign is in Seattle
rather than a WNBA team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The WNBA is just for owners to fill empty arenas,'' said
O'Neill, a former schoolteacher who was fired because of her sexual
orientation. ``It's the same three stars over and over, trying to
look feminine. It just gives me the creeps.''

QUESTIONS ON COCA-COLA AS FOREIGN MARKETS ROIL 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Coca-Cola Co. executives have summoned Wall Street analysts for
a hastily scheduled meeting Friday morning in New York, suggesting
that the leading soft-drink company is about to deliver ominous
news about earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Coke derives most of its fortunes from overseas, where economic
crises have ravaged the earnings of many American multinational
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based company declined to comment about the
substance of the meeting, other than to call it ``a volume and
earnings update for the third quarter and the full year.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is the first time Coke has organized an analysts'
briefing on such short notice _ analysts were called on Tuesday _
and the first briefing since the economic crisis now afflicting
Asia, Russia and Latin America began more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Things are already at a relative low point for Coke; many
analysts have already reduced their forecasts for volumes and
earnings over the last few weeks, and the share price has plummeted
from a mid-July high of $88.938 to $58 at the market's close
Wednesday, on a day when the broad market rose more than 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company was dealt a setback by the French
government last week, which rejected Coke's plans to buy the
Orangina brand from Pernod-Ricard SA.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about Coke's profitability abroad have intensified as
the economic problems overseas have worsened. Will key Latin
American markets, like Mexico, be the next to fall? Is Eastern
Europe, in the shadow of the stagnant Russian economy, about to
unravel? How bad will sales be in Japan, where they were off 3
percent in the second quarter? How much of all this already is
reflected in Coke's stock price?
</P>
<P>
   Gillette and Procter &AMP; Gamble, two consumer-products giants
often mentioned in the same breath as Coke, issued warnings about
their earnings earlier this week, further raising speculation about
what Coke executives might say Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chances are good that we are going to see them guide
near-term estimates lower,'' said Marc Cohen, a beverage analyst
for Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., adding that he thought the company would
also offer encouragement that the fundamentals for a good long-term
performance remain intact.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he expected Coke executives to forecast sales growth
of 5 percent to 6 percent for the third quarter, compared with 9
percent to 10 percent in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had anticipated some moderation, but it has moderated more
than we thought it would,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Solomon, a beverage analyst for Salomon Smith Barney,
who downgraded the stock from ``buy'' to ``hold'' 13 months ago,
said, ``They are certainly going to have to give some guidance on
earnings, and they may just confirm what's out there.''
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the meeting, with Coke's chairman and chief
executive, M. Douglas Ivester, and the company's chief financial
officer, James E. Chestnut, is expected to focus on how Coke, which
last year collected two-thirds of its profits outside the United
States, plans to navigate this latest downturn.
</P>
<P>
   While Coke has shown skill at running its business in individual
countries despite local economic problems _ the Mexican peso crisis
in 1994-95, during which Coke proved itself better equipped than
some local brands to withstand the pressure, and wound up with more
market share, is often cited _ the current challenge is greater.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are macroeconomic factors that they have to manage
through,'' said Doug Lane, a beverage analyst with Merrill Lynch,
``and they've never had to do it on such a broad-based scale.
That's what's different this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Lane said Latin America, where Coke made about 17.5 percent of
its profits last year, was already starting to show signs of a
slowdown in its consumption of Coke products.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, he added, sales were still strong but he expected
them to slow; Wednesday Merrill Lynch lowered its rating on the
main Coke bottler in Mexico, Coke Femsa, from ``buy'' to
``neutral.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivester and Chestnut are expected to reiterate Coke's longtime
position, that economic downturns present investment opportunities
for the company around the world, and that Coke is generally
planning more for the long term.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Pecoriello, an analyst with Sanford Bernstein, said the
picture may become bleaker once additional factors are included.
Much of the downgrading so far, he said, has come from concerns
about currency devaluations that hurt multinational company
earnings abroad when converted into dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now what you're talking about is revisions related not only to
falling sales volume, but also increased sales expenses,'' he said.
``They are not reducing the market spending in the short run, which
means you are spending more than you would have per unit, had the
volume not decelerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Another analyst, Emanuel Goldman of Paine Webber in San
Francisco, said he remained bullish on Coke, and had met with his
sales force Wednesday to tell them that ``the time to buy Coke is
when it breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony of all this is that the long-term story is as strong
as it's ever been,'' Goldman said. ``This doesn't mean that they
are having fun right now. But they are very good at managing within
environments that for some companies would be very difficult.''

 &HT;    Hurricane Georges: ``It's an act of God.''
 &HT;    By Mary McLachlin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH _ Hurricane Georges floundered across Cuba
toward the Keys and extreme South Florida on Wednesday, leaving
Palm Beach County with the likelihood of tropical storm conditions
Friday and highway gridlock today.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels in Palm Beach, Martin and St. Lucie counties already were
filling Wednesday as tens of thousands heeded the hurricane maxim:
Run from the water, hide from the wind.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday night, 70 percent of the Keys' 80,000 residents had
obeyed evacuation orders, and officials contemplated ordering
Miami-Dade County's coastal areas evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at 1 million-plus people that may be under
evacuation in the next 72 hours,'' said Craig Fugate, chief of the
state's Bureau of Prepardness and Response.
</P>
<P>
   South Florida below Deerfield Beach went under a hurricane watch
as the storm that left 37 dead in the northern Caribbean moved
across open water from Haiti to Cuba. The watch means
hurricane-force winds of at least 74 mph could reach the area by
late today.
</P>
<P>
   Tolls were lifted from all highways to keep traffic moving, and
school buses were used to haul evacuees from the Keys to a shelter
at Florida International University. Tri-Rail stopped running
commuter trains Wednesday night, and freight and passenger trains
will stop by noon today to keep tracks clear on evacuation routes.
</P>
<P>
   Schools were closed in Monroe County Wednesday and will be
closed in Miami-Dade, Broward, Collier and Lee counties today. Palm
Beach County schools will be open, but officials will decide today
whether to close them Friday and if shelters need to be opened. St.
Lucie County schools will close early today, and Martin County
officials will decide today whether to let students leave early.
insert latest advisory. After traversing Hispaniola and ramming
western Cuba, Georges weakened to winds of 75 mph _ just 2 miles
over the threshold to be called a hurricane. But it was expected to
gain strength and slice through the Keys late tonight or early
Friday between Key West and Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Satellite pictures make us think it is coming back like
gangbusters,'' said Jerry Jarrell, director of the National
Hurricane Center in Miami. ``We'd get the worst of it if it went
through the Keys.''
</P>
<P>
   Georges' hurricane force winds extend up to 60 miles from the
center, Jarrell said. Tropical storm force winds extend up to 175
miles from the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast can expect winds of
30-40 mph beginning tonight and increasing to 50-60 mph on Friday,
said Jim Lushine, storm warning coordinator for the National
Weather Service in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Along with those winds will be very heavy rains,'' he said,
``which, coming on top of ground already flooded in the past week,
is going to add to the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The South Florida Water Management District predicted populated
sections of Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties will get an
average of 8 inches of rain from 8 p.m. today through 8 p.m.
Sunday. Some spots could receive 12 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Showers could begin late today, district meteorologist Eric
Swartz said. By 8 a.m. Friday, water managers are predicting 1.5
inches for eastern Palm Beach County and 1 inch for eastern Martin
and St. Lucie counties.
</P>
<P>
   Water managers continued to warn residents Wednesday to prepare
for extensive flooding, especially in The Acreage and other
low-lying areas. The district has been draining its canals
throughout the region since last week to make room for as much rain
runoff as possible, but the soil is like a wet sponge already
saturated from weeks of downpours.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 30 days, an average of 12.6 inches has fallen on
Palm Beach County, water managers said. Martin and St. Lucie
counties averaged 9.31 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Area hospitals urged people Wednesday not to show up at their
facilities, which aren't official shelters, and not to come to
emergency rooms unless they're in a true emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Bethesda Memorial Hospital and Boca Community Hospital have
canceled elective surgeries, but Delray Medical Center and West
Boca Medical Center have not, officials said. Bethesda Memorial was
checking to see if patients could be sent home early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people in this area have panicked yet,'' said
spokeswoman Janet Amato. ``I'm expecting tomorrow (Thursday) will
be the true test.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals also prepared for an expected surge in births,
traditionally brought on by drops in barometric pressure associated
with storms. Boca Raton Community Hospital will allow pregnant
women admitted by their doctors to bring a companion with them, but
they also will be asked to bring their own water, food, blanket,
pillow and flashlight.
</P>
<P>
   Pregnant women near labor can sit in the lobby at Good Samaritan
and St. Mary's medical centers, but only on their doctors'
recommendation, said spokeswoman Pat Bowers. They also should bring
their own food.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Power &AMP; Light Co. began organizing crews of electrical
workers Wednesday and stationing them in various parts of northern
Florida. Outside contractors will be called in if necessary to help
FPL employees restore power in damaged areas.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth began shipping dozens of back-up power generators into
South Florida. About 56 units are expected to be moved to the Boca
Raton area from Jacksonville, said spokeswoman Marta Casas-Celaya.
The generators will be used to run the phone company's local
switching offices if the storm causes a blackout.
</P>
<P>
   In the farming region south of Lake Okeechobee, sugar and
vegetable growers worried about their crops, the canals that feed
them and the wind and rain that could ruin them.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at Clewiston-based U.S. Sugar Corp. were topping off
fuel tanks and lowering water levels in the canals that surround
the sugar cane fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take it seriously, and we start several days ahead,''
Senior Vice President Bob Buker said.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Hamilton, general manager of A. Duda &AMP; Sons' Belle Glade
operation, said he doesn't have many vegetables in the ground yet
but is concerned about his 12,000 acres of mature sugar cane that's
ready for harvest and can easily uproot in heavy wind.
</P>
<P>
   Also vulnerable are Hamilton's celery seedlings, which are in
containers under shade cloth waiting to be put into the ground.
Today workers will remove the shade cloth, which can rip away in
wind, and hope for the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're more afraid of the water than anything,'' Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Dubois, production manager for Callery-Judge Groves in
Loxahatchee, had drained the fields, stocked up on fuel, secured
all buildings and loose objects. Dubois said computer records will
be copied onto tapes and put in a safe place.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the crop goes, there's nothing we can do,'' said
Dubois, whose company grows grapefruit and tangerines on about
4,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an act of God.''

   MIAMI _ As Hurricane Georges reached Cuba, the 80,000 residents
of the Florida Keys began evacuating their vulnerable island chain
Wednesday and a hurricane watch was issued for the four million
residents of Miami and the rest of South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The storm has already made a shambles of much of Puerto Rico,
the Dominican Republic and Haiti, leaving at least 50 people dead,
according to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen people were officially reported killed in both Haiti
and the Dominican Republic, which the storm struck on Tuesday. But,
the actual toll appears to have been much higher.
</P>
<P>
   In San Cristobal, 20 miles east of Santo Domingo, the Nizao
River overflowed and knocked down a part of a school used as a
shelter, reporters said, leaving 5 dead and 31 missing. There were
also unconfirmed reports that 5 people were killed in Santo Domingo
by an overflowing river.
</P>
<P>
   In the shanty neighborhood of La Cienega, the swollen river
invaded thousands of homes, covering some up to the roofs in fetid
water. Residents swam out to their houses to try to retrieve their
belongings, some using empty gallon water jugs tied to their arms
to help them float.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, fearing that the storm could become the most ruinous
to strike Florida since Hurricane Andrew in 1992, Gov. Lawton
Chiles also declared a state of emergency for central and southern
Florida, allowing him to mobilize the National Guard. Schools were
ordered closed on Thursday and Friday in Miami-Dade County, and all
but essential county employees have been ordered to stay home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other evacuations, from Palm Beach to Tampa Bay, could start
tonight or Thursday morning,'' depending on the course the storm
takes, the Florida Department of Community Affairs warned in a
statement late Wednesday afternoon. At the same time, the National
Weather Service predicted ``storm surge flooding of four to six
feet above normal tide levels, accompanied by large and dangerous
battering waves'' in coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
   Since beginning its deadly march across the Caribbean last
weekend, the storm has killed at least 28 people and inflicted
widespread destruction, including more than $1 billion in property
damage in Puerto Rico alone. The Insurance Information Institute
said most of the claims expected in the Caribbean would come from
commercial properties like hotels and resorts.
</P>
<P>
   With sustained winds of 115 miles an hour, the storm has moved
on a course from the northern Leeward Islands west and north across
the Dominican Republic and Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Weather forecasters predicted that the storm, which slowed
Wednesday and lost enough wind strength that it was temporarily
dropped to a Category 1 storm from a stronger Category 2, would
strike late Thursday somewhere in South Florida. The precise path
remained uncertain, which led the National Hurricane Center here to
declare a hurricane watch for both the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic
coasts of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were waiting for a better sense of the storm's
trajectory before ordering evacuations or directing residents to
shelters, said John Joyce, a spokesman for the state Emergency
Operations Center. ``Because of the large swath of this storm, if
you move people, you might have to move them again in another
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   But from Key West to Key Largo, the northernmost island in the
Keys, a steady stream of cars and sport vehicles towing boats moved
north on U.S. 1, the two-lane road that links the low-lying
120-mile-long chain of islands to mainland Florida. At 5 p.m., the
highway was closed to all southbound traffic, and the authorities
said that residents who remained behind were on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our first mandatory evacuation in memory,'' said Cindy
Peryam, a spokeswoman for the Monroe County sheriff's office, ``so
we have no way of knowing how people will react. But since
Hurricane Andrew, people are much more cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   People leaving the Keys were directed to the main campus of
Florida International University, just a stone's throw from the
National Hurricane Center's headquarters west of Miami. But, Ms.
Peryam said, ``we're not going to be able to fit everybody there,
so this is one of those no-win situations where you hope people
will go north.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hurricane Andrew struck Miami with winds of 150 mph in
August 1992, almost 90 percent of Miami-Dade County's two million
residents had never experienced a tropical storm. But memories of
that experience have remained vivid, and people have moved promptly
to get emergency supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were lines before we even opened the store today,'' said
Victor Chin, manager of a Home Depot store in Kendall, the Miami
suburb that was one of the areas hardest hit by Hurricane Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   Chin said lines were ``maybe three or four hours deep,'' with
customers stocking up on batteries, plywood, flashlights and
shutters.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Andrew was the most costly natural disaster in
American history, inflicting more than $25 billion in damages,
which led several large insurance companies to abandon the state
and forced others into bankruptcy. The Florida state insurance
commissioner, Bill Nelson, said here Wednesday that an $11 billion
hurricane damage compensation fund had been created, but added that
he expected to have to draw only on a small part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with 1992, Nelson said, ``we are looking at much
stronger structures to endure hurricane force winds.'' Building
codes throughout the state have been tightened, he said, and
enforcement has been stepped up.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Florida, residents have been shaken by the death and
devastation that Hurricane Georges has left in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, at least 150,000 people were evacuated from coastal and
mountain areas of four eastern provinces as the storm bore down on
the island after lashing Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   President Fidel Castro urged calm and ``revolutionary unity'' in
a television address, saying, ``The resources are ready and the
measures available to confront the hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, local officials appeared confident that they could
meet whatever the storm threw at them. ``This will not be as bad as
Hurricane Andrew,'' Alex Penelas, Mayor of Miami-Dade County, said
Wednesday in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned. We are not panicking. We are telling people
to be prepared,'' Penelas said. ``My level of apprehension is
somewhat controlled.''

U.S. URGING NATO TO STEP UP PLANS TO ACT AGAINST YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (cb)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   VILAMOURA, Portugal _ Defense Secretary William Cohen said on
Wednesday that NATO had to be prepared to act to prevent a
humanitarian disaster in Kosovo or the alliance would rightly face
``severe criticism'' for issuing empty threats.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of a meeting of NATO members' defense ministers at a
resort here in southern Portugal, Cohen said that on Thursday the
United States would call on NATO to take the next step toward
calling up a force that could carry out missile strikes or a larger
air campaign against the Yugoslav forces cracking down on rebels in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Under the alliance's labored planning process, the next step _
called an activation warning _ would notify the allies to ready
forces for one of several attack plans already drawn up by NATO's
military commanders. American and NATO officials said the allies
would go along with the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The action would stop short of authorizing the use of force. A
senior defense official traveling with Cohen described the action
as ``the last step in the planning process and not the first step
in a military act,'' explaining that NATO would have to take
several more steps before launching any strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Cohen said the step would demonstrate the
alliance's resolve against the Yugoslav President, Slobodan
Milosevic, who has by and large ignored NATO's threats and its
months of military planning. It would, he said, ``send a very
strong signal to Milosevic that this is serious, this is more than
words.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen went on to say that the organization's credibility was at
stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO has a choice now,'' he said in an interview with
reporters on his way to Portugal on Wednesday. ``They must go
forward with this, or it will be seen as simply a hollow warning.''
</P>
<P>
   With the meeting Wednesday coming hard on the heels of the vote
by the U.N. Security Council to call on Milosevic to end his
repressive crackdown in Kosovo, the United States and its European
allies are mounting a coordinated, last-ditch effort to avoid the
spectacle of thousands of refugees stranded in the hills, unable or
afraid to return to their homes as winter arrives.
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing consensus within the Clinton Administration
and NATO that the alliance badly misplayed its hand against
Milosevic over the summer when it warned of strikes and staged an
aerial exercise in neighboring Albania, only to do nothing when his
forces stepped up their crackdown and began shelling villages, not
just rebel strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   The inaction has prompted sharp criticism of the Clinton
Administration and NATO. In a speech in Washington on Tuesday
night, former Senator Bob Dole, who traveled to Kosovo this month
with Assistant Secretary of State John Shattuck, accused the
Administration of ``tough talk and no action.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As in Bosnia, instead of firing up the engines, NATO is firing
up excuses,'' Dole said in a speech to the International Republican
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's military commanders have completed plans for a
range of possible military actions against Milosevic's forces _
from a limited cruise missile strike to an escalating air campaign
first against military targets in Kosovo and then against targets
throughout Serbia. NATO has also drafted plans to police a
cease-fire, if one is reached, and to provide food, shelter and
other relief to stranded refugees.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said Wednesday that the plans could require
several hundred warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen declined to say the type and amount of American forces
that would take part in any NATO strikes, but the alliance has
already informally asked countries to make pledges, and the United
States has agreed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In some of his most forceful language yet, Cohen called
Milosevic's crackdown a ``challenge I don't think NATO can afford
to walk away from.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't simply ignore what he continues to do,'' he said.

SEEING A FUND AS TOO BIG TO FAIL, NEW YORK FED ASSISTS ITS BAILOUT
</HEADLINE>
   (Updates with agreement being reached, corrects spelling of
Hilibrand, extensive editing)  
(jt) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has helped
organize the rescue of a large and prominent speculative fund,
indicating that regulators recognize that such speculators are an
increasingly significant factor in world markets.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement reached late Wednesday, the fund, Long-Term
Capital Management LP, which is said to be have a portfolio worth
$90 billion, received a cash infusion of more than $3.5 billion
from a consortium of commercial banks and investment firms. The
deal came after representatives of 16 banks and brokerage houses
met at the offices of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in
downtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   It is extremely unusual for the Federal Reserve to get involved
in the bailout of a hedge fund, a virtually unregulated type of
investment firm, which despite its name, speculates in high-risk
trades in markets around the world. A spokesman for the New York
Federal Reserve Bank, the biggest of the Fed's 12 regional banks,
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   But the Federal Reserve Bank's actions show that regulators are
deeply concerned about the impact that a liquidation of Long-Term
Capital's trades would have on brokerage firms and banks already
struggling with huge losses from worldwide market turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators in the past have encouraged creditors and borrowers
to work together to avoid the kind of panic selling of a portfolio
that could harm other investors in a particular market. For
example, during the downturn in real estate in the early 1990s, the
Fed had asked banks to work with developers on the ropes. After the
stock market crash in 1987, the Fed provided liquidity to
securities firms that might have been on shaky ground.
</P>
<P>
   For the Fed to get involved with a speculator like Long-Term
Capital's chief, John Meriwether, is an indication that this time
around, the asset of greatest concern is not commercial real estate
or stocks. This time, it is bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital has been hurt by the same market developments
that have led to losses at many investment firms. As turmoil in
Russia grew, culminating with the country's de facto default on
some debt and its devaluation of the ruble, investors fled risky
securities. Many took refuge in the United States Treasury market,
where prices surged, driving yields to record lows.
</P>
<P>
   This confluence of events hurt Meriwether, who had been a big
buyer of riskier bonds; adding insult to injury, the firm had also
sold Treasury securities as a hedge for its non-Treasury bond
holdings. When Treasury prices rose, Meriwether wound up on the
losing end of both sides of his trades.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed may have been prompted to act quickly on Long-Term
Capital's problems because it realizes that many of the world's
hedge funds and most of the big brokerage houses have billions of
dollars in trades on their books that are identical to those
skewering Meriwether.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fed is aware of the precarious position that exists among
the largest dealers who have positions in virtually every
fixed-income product versus Treasuries,'' said one trader, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity. `` If Long-Term Capital had to
take off its trades, all the hedge funds and dealers would be
killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because having a seller liquidating billion-dollar
positions in these markets would drive them even lower than they
now are. This could cause other failures among hedge funds and make
dealer firms' losses spiral, causing another wave of selling.
</P>
<P>
   And like many hedge funds, Long-Term Capital made its bets on
borrowed money. At times, the value of its positions exceeded its
capital by 50, even 100 times. Recently, for example, Meriwether's
firm was said to be holding positions worth $90 billion, while its
capital, as of Sept. 2, stood at $2.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Even without panic selling, things have been bad for Long-Term
Capital since August. At the beginning of the year, the firm had
around $4.8 billion in capital. By Sept. 2, that capital had
dwindled to $2.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   His losses mounting, Meriwether wrote a three-page letter to his
investors. He explained that his fund was down 44 percent in the
month of August alone and was off 52 percent for the year. Some 82
percent of the losses came in so-called relative value trades, a
specialty of Meriwether's, which identify small price differences
between, say, a futures contract on a particular bond and the
security itself. The remaining 18 percent was lost in directional
trades, in which Long-Term bet on a certain issue, up or down.
Included in this group were losses in emerging markets, including
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Meriwether affirmed his belief in the trades his
firm had made and called the market environment ``unusually
attractive.'' He asked investors to consider making additional
investments to the firm.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, no one did. Indeed, at about this time, the
firm went to Soros Fund Management asking for an infusion of $500
million. The request was denied.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks since Meriwether wrote his letter, the market has
hammered Long-Term Capital relentlessly. Treasuries have kept
rising and all other debt has continued to lag. Even if he did not
try to unwind some of his trades, having to mark his positions to
market each night meant that his paper losses required more
capital.
</P>
<P>
   It was no surprise, then, that in recent days, bond traders have
suspected Meriwether and his associates of trying to unload some of
their holdings to meet margin requirements. Last Friday, for
example, Long-Term Capital bought a number of Treasury futures to
unwind one side of a huge trade. The buying moved the spread
between the futures and the so-called cash market in that
particular issue by one-quarter of a point, an enormous move in the
world's deepest, most liquid securities market.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of Wednesday's bailout were not given. But bankers say
that the institutions _ including Goldman, Sachs, Merrill Lynch,
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, J.P. Morgan, Chase Manhattan and UBS of
Switzerland, among others _ agreed to put up roughly $250 million
each in return for an equity stake in Long-Term Capital.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed that existing equity holders, also known as
limited partners, would end up with a greatly diminished ownership
in the firm, between 10 and 20 percent of their original stakes. A
spokesman for Long-Term Capital declined to comment on Wednesday's
developments.
</P>
<P>
   Meriwether, of course, has faced adversity before. He left his
position as chairman of Salomon Brothers in 1991 after Paul Mozer,
one of the firm's Treasury traders, was caught trying to corner the
market in two-year Treasury securities. Meriwether formed Long-Term
Capital in 1994, along with the Salomon Brothers alumni Lawrence
Hilibrand and Eric Rosenfeld, and Robert Merton and Myron Scholes,
both Nobel laureates in economics.
</P>
<P>
   With its stable of star traders, Long-Term Capital attracted
money from banks, brokerage houses and wealthy individuals, all of
whom agreed to lock up their investments until at the earliest, the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Long-Term Capital rides out this storm, the world of
hedge funds will probably never be the same. Many investors will
likely flee all such funds, and regulators will probably scrutinize
their operations a lot more closely. Meriwether himself will be
under the scrutiny of an oversight committee appointed by the banks
that bailed him out.

GREENSPAN SUGGESTS RATE CUT IS UNDER CONSIDERATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for fine tuning throughout)  (Eds: See also FED-ECONSCENE) 
(mk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman,
suggested Wednesday that the central bank would seriously consider
cutting interest rates next week because of the deepening world
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to bring the existing instabilities to a level of
stability reasonably shortly, to prevent the contagion from really
spilling over and creating some very significant further
difficulties for all of us,'' Greenspan told the Senate Budget
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   His comments sent the stock market up strongly, and the Dow
Jones industrial average closed 257.21 points higher, or 3.26
percent, to 8,154.41, its strongest level since the 512.61-point
plunge Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, who as usual left himself some wiggle room, hedged
his comments by observing that the American economy remains strong
and unemployment low, a combination that would normally lead the
Federal Reserve to worry about inflation. And in a nod to members
of the central bank's policy-making committee who might be
reluctant to cut rates when they meet on Tuesday, he emphasized
that the decision was not his alone.
</P>
<P>
   But in his clearest warning yet that the global crisis is
threatening the nation's long economic expansion, Greenspan
enumerated developments over the last several months that could
slow growth in the United States. They included the decline in the
stock market, a reduction in lending by banks and a general rise in
uncertainty that could make consumers more cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't comment at this particular stage on what particular
actions will or will not be taken,'' Greenspan said when asked
about the possibility of a rate cut on Tuesday. ``But I really
would suggest to you that I think we know where we have to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has not cut interest rates since January
1996, when it reduced its short-term federal funds target rate to
5.25 percent from 5.5 percent. It raised the rate back to 5.5
percent in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said the central bank might still take only a half
step when it meets next Tuesday and adopt a formal ``bias'' toward
an ease in policy, a signal that it expects its next move to be a
rate cut.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a growing feeling among analysts that Greenspan
would make a strong case at the meeting for an immediate cut of a
quarter of a percentage point and try to persuade the committee's
more inflation-wary members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means the odds now strongly favor him cutting rates on
Sept. 29,'' said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey Lanston &AMP;
Co. in New York. Economists said Greenspan previewed the argument
he was likely to make to the central bank's Federal Open Market
Committee in saying Wednesday that ``deteriorating foreign
economies and their spillover to domestic markets have increased
the possibility that the slowdown in the growth of the American
economy will be more than sufficient to hold inflation in check.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has couched his increasingly explicit discussions of
the rationale for a rate cut in terms of protecting the domestic
economic expansion, which began in 1991 and has seen inflation
almost wiped out even as unemployment has fallen to its lowest
level in more than 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   But with much of Asia in recession, Russia in economic turmoil
and Latin America increasingly at risk, industrialized and
developing nations alike have been calling for a rate reduction in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A rate cut by the Fed could help the rest of the world by
stimulating more growth in the United States, a major market for
the goods and services produced in many struggling economies.
</P>
<P>
   It could lead to a weaker dollar and help encourage lower
interest rates in other nations. That could help ease some of the
financial pressure felt by governments, banks and companies that
are struggling with falling currency values and debts denominated
in dollars. And it could provide a psychological boost to financial
markets, which have been looking to Greenspan for signs of
leadership at a time when governments and international
institutions have provided few answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way of saying we're going to do our part to sustain
growth in our own economy at a time when the world is fragile,''
said Robert DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Smith Barney in New
York. ``Cutting rates in America doesn't solve the banking and debt
restructuring problems of these troubled places, but you start to
form a base for rebuilding confidence in the global economy and
then hope everybody does their part.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan first raised the possibility of a rate cut in a speech
in California early this month, saying the United States could not
expect to remain an ``island of prosperity'' at a time when much of
the rest of world was struggling. Last week he said there was no
prospect of a coordinated rate cut by the world's biggest
industrial countries _ Germany's powerful Bundesbank had already
signaled that it would not go along _ but again hinted that slowing
growth in the United States might justify a policy easing by the
Fed.
</P>
<P>
   His wording Wednesday, however, was far more forceful than in
his previous statements about the risks facing the world and
American economies and his signal of an eventual rate cut
considerably less veiled.
</P>
<P>
   There are few signs that the crisis that began last year in Asia
is subsiding, he said, describing the last several months as ``the
most recent, more virulent phase of the crisis.'' The problems in
the rest of the world have ``also been accompanied by a rising
concern for risk in the United States,'' he said, adding that the
``restraining effects of recent development on the U.S. economy are
likely to intensify.''
</P>
<P>
   Through much of this year, Greenspan held off pressure from a
number of Fed policy-makers for an interest-rate increase to head
off inflationary pressures. Two of the committee's 12 members _
Jerry Jordan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland,
and William Poole, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St.
Louis _ voted last spring for an interest-rate increase, and a
number of others were leaning in that direction.

AN AGREEMENT TO INCREASE SPECIAL VISAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House and congressional leaders agreed
Wednesday on legislation to increase the number of foreign workers
who can get visas allowing them to fill high-technology jobs in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is supported by computer and other technology
companies, but it was opposed by labor unions, and until now the
Clinton administration had said it would veto the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the White House said that it had won concessions from
Congress, including hundreds of millions of dollars for training
programs for American workers, to be paid for by fees charged for
each foreign applicant who receives one of the special visas.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the White House now on board, I hope we can get this law
enacted very quickly,'' said Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., who is
chairman of the subcommittee on immigration of the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Under the compromise, the number of workers admitted into the
United States because of their special skills would rise from
65,000 a year to about 115,000 a year for the next three years.
This year, the annual limit was filled in May, and there is now a
backlog of tens of thousands of applicants for the visas.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders scheduled a vote on the bill for as
early as Thursday. The Senate passed a different version in May,
but the White House said it would veto that version.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise would require some companies to attest that they
had tried to fill jobs with Americans and that they had not laid
off American workers with similar skills.
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies and universities have argued that they
cannot fill critical positions without this access to foreign
workers, who are often paid generous salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement comes as President Clinton is planning a trip to
California, where high-technology companies have been outspoken in
support of the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the compromise is one which the White House should
support, because this president regularly talks about his interest
in maintaining the competitive level in Silicon Valley,'' said Rep.
David Dreier, R-Calif., at a news conference Wednesday, before the
White House announced its support.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill does have bipartisan support,'' said Rep. Adam
Smith, D-Wash. ``I have a very strong record with labor and unions,
and I think this bill will help labor and help unions, because it
will create jobs here in this country.''

IN VICTORY AND DEFEAT .... COACHES' SPOUSES BEAR HEAVY LOAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<P>
   PHOENIX - Long before guiding Lakeside Blue Ridge to four
straight undefeated football seasons, Paul Moro tried to resign . .
. three times.
</P>
<P>
   Before taking Horizon to the 5A football pinnacle, Doug Shaffer,
mourning the death of his daughter and drained by parents insistent
on shoving him out, was ready to quit.
</P>
<P>
   Before building Chandler Seton Catholic's girls basketball
program into a champion, Karen Self had no college degree, hated
her job and didn't see herself building much of any kind of career.
</P>
<P>
   The courses of the three coaches' lives took positive turns
mainly because of one person in each of their lives _ their spouse.
</P>
<P>
   Their spouses wouldn't let them abandon dreams, their careers,
their focus, and kept their passions burning brightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally didn't want to join the divorce ranks,'' said
Moro, who was going to call it quits for the third and final time
in 1990 _ six state championships ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game is not more important than my family. I was going to
be a dad, a husband,.'' Moro said. He turned in his letter of
resignation to Blue Ridge administrators, who sat on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife stepped up and said, `You know what? I think God wants
you to be a coach. This is what we need to be doing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Once her three children were old enough to care for themselves,
Joyce Moro got involved.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday nights, you won't find Paul on the sideline without
Joyce, his college sweetheart, who keeps statistics and an on-going
conversation with referees, who explain calls to give her a better
understanding of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't sit around feeling sorry for myself,'' Joyce Moro
said. ``I see the lives he touches. Because of that, it's not just
a game.''
</P>
<P>
   So have many other significant others in the lives of Arizona's
high school coaches. &QL; 
On the sidelines &QL; 
Ronda Fetkenhier leads Glendale Cactus' statistics crew while her
husband, Larry, leads his top-ranked football team on Friday
nights.
</P>
<P>
   While Jim Ewan coaches Glendale Mountain Ridge, his wife, Luann,
photographs the games. At the season-ending team banquet, she
presents a slide show with music that reflects the agony and the
ecstasy of the season.
</P>
<P>
   For much of Bill Farrell's basketball coaching career at
Paradise Valley, his wife Darlene never saw a group of 17-year-old
boys she felt she couldn't feed. Once, Bill took 21 players to his
Flagstaff cabin and left her to figure out sleeping and eating
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me a week of honey-dos just to get on speaking terms
again,'' Farrell said.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, Darlene says she feels like one of the lucky ones
whose marriage grew each year with a new group of children, besides
their own, in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young coaches' wives call me and say, `How did it work all
this time for you?' '' Darlene said. ``Absolutely, the wife has to
be involved for her not to be second fiddle.'' &QL; 
Stressful &QL; 
When the kids are young, somebody needs to stay home to raise the
children. Somebody needs to be the fix-it person when things go
wrong around the house and the primary bread winner is somewhere in
Tuba City coaching a game.
</P>
<P>
   It can be stressful. It can wreck a marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You spend more time with other people's kids than you do with
your own,'' said Jim Ewan, whose second marriage has lasted 16
years, thanks to a wife who loves and supports what he does.
</P>
<P>
   Prep coaches figure they're paid just cents for each hour they
spend on the job. They teach fundamentals. They scout. They drive
great distances to exchange film. They watch film, critique film.
They attend camps. They put up with unhappy parents. They unwind at
restaurants, bars and who knows where else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how many years ago this happened,'' Larry
Fetkenhier said, ``but one time my wife said, `I love you. I care
when you win or lose. But when you lose, I'm not going to walk
around this house like it's a morgue.' At first that bothered me.
But it was important. She needs her own identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Fetkenhier now makes a point of making a date with his wife once
a week, whether it's going to a movie or dining at a nice
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's his idea,'' Ronda said. ``It's important that we can sit
and talk across the table.'' &QL; 
Some marriages fail &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rich Carlberg's marriage ended in divorce 13 years ago, in part
a victim of the demands of coaching football and baseball at
Sunnyslope. Now, he just coaches baseball and says, ``I've not had
a girlfriend make it through a season yet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaches' wives have to put up with a lot,'' he said. ``They're
raising kids on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   After his divorce, Carlberg said he raised his two daughters,
Michelle, now 18 and a college freshman, and Sandy, 16, a junior at
Sunnyslope, while still coaching.
</P>
<P>
   When his daughters were younger, Carlberg said a co-worker
picked them up from school or the baby sitter and brought them to
the baseball field, where they caught the end of their father's
practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``He taught us all the baseball-field maintenance techniques,''
Sandy said.
</P>
<P>
   All that raking, mowing and watering served as a bonding
mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard a coach say he thought he made a mistake with his
kids, because he was way too long on the field,'' Carlberg said.
``He said, `I looked up one day and they were gone.' I didn't want
that to happen to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Sandy calls her father her best friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had baseball, but we were always his first priority,'' she
said. &QL; 
Inner happiness &QL; 
The former Karen O'Connor has been married to Rory Self for three
years. They dated for nearly five years before that. In between,
Rory pushed Karen back to Arizona State, where she once played
basketball, to finish her degree, get her teaching certificate and
begin doing something she really loved _ coaching.
</P>
<P>
   His involvement is primarily as fan and sounding board for Karen
after long games.
</P>
<P>
   They knew there would be nights apart, that Karen would have
trips to California and Nevada to take club teams to tournaments
without him. There is an open invitation for him to come along, but
his work as a computer programmer usually prevents that.
</P>
<P>
   Their marriage is strong, and they're talking about starting a
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Coaching) is something she really enjoys,'' Rory said.
``Luckily enough, what she makes is not as large an issue as it is
for other couples. Inner happiness is what it's about. No way I'll
get in the way of that.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what has kept Mountain Pointe badminton and softball
coach Karen Jacobson and her husband Keith together for 31 years of
marriage. Keith, director of Arizona State's recreation center, did
most of the cooking for their daughters, Kerry, a senior gymnast at
Boise State, and Kori, a freshman softball player at Georgia Tech,
while they were growing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of constant adjustment,'' said Karen, who said
this probably will be her last year of coaching. ``I think we made
an agreement from the beginning that we'd each have our own things
to do. That helped make it work.'' &QL; 
Family affair &QL; 
The Fetkenhiers are making these Friday nights a family affair,
with Larry and Ronda on the sideline, son Casey playing linebacker,
and daughter Lauren part of the cheerleading squad.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the game, Larry and Ronda lend themselves to other
coaches and their wives who struggle with the lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen coaches quit because (husband and wife) don't deal
with it together,'' Ronda said. ``You end up being full-time mom
and dad during football season. Once you accept that, that's when
it is OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fetkenhiers weren't without their struggles before their
children reached high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the summer, a few years ago, I went to a passing league,
and my son had a T-ball game,'' Larry said. ``As I'm driving, I'm
saying to myself, `I sure as hell hope some parent appreciates what
I'm doing for their kid at the expense of my kid.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Before he got to high school, Casey said he felt like he was
competing for his father's love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, I'd get jealous,'' Casey said. ``But he had to show
support to his players and I had to face that. That's his job. I'm
his son. Everyone else is like his second son.''
</P>
<P>
   The spouses and children also must compete for time and
attention with other members of the coaching staff. There's a
camaraderie, a bond forged from so much time spent together, that
can cause jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   ``One year,'' Fetkenhier said, ``we went to a party during the
season, and Ronda said, `Don't you ever get tired of those guys?'
You go through so many ups and downs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably the easiest target for an assistant coach's wife.
I'm the reason he's gone Saturday or Sunday, or he's in Los Angeles
this weekend for a clinic.''
</P>
<P>
   The payoff certainly isn't monetary. The average head coach
makes about $2,500 annually, which is added to their teaching
salary. Assistants earn less.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a letter once from a former player, who is now a coach,
saying, `If not for football, I don't think I would have been able
to get through Desert Storm,' '' Fetkenhier said. ``When you get a
letter like that, the money isn't as important.'' &QL; 
Ready to quit &QL; 
Coaching was put into proper perspective for Doug Shaffer in 1986,
when his 8-year-old daughter, Alyssa, died of a brain tumor.
</P>
<P>
   He had gotten out of coaching in '84 to help care for his ailing
daughter and give his wife, Becky, a fourth-grade teacher, a break
and a chance to go back to work to help pay for the mounting
medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1987, a year after he returned as a head coach at
Horizon, after Shaffer's Huskies suffered through a second straight
miserable season, going 1-9, some parents demanded Shaffer's
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   A kidney problem added to the stress. He was ready to give in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Don't let them beat you. Don't let them pressure
you.' '' Becky said. ``I'm glad he hung in there.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Shaffer coached Horizon to the state title. The next
season, Horizon was back in the final,losing to St. Mary's. Now,
there's something even better. He's coaching his son, Derek, the
long snapper and backup center.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to us could have ruined a lot of marriages,''
Doug says. ``It brought us together closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Becky's a tough person. It's tough for a mother to lose a
daughter. We fought through that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ewans went through a similar tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1989, Luann's 14-year-old daughter, Jacque, was
struck by a car and killed. Two months later, Jim was hired as the
head football coach at Mesa Community College.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of like the worst of times and the best of
times,'' said Luann, who teaches English at Mountain Ridge. ``His
hiring helped us get through the grief and heartache. We could
focus on something else. We always knew Jacque was right there with
us.'' &QL; 
Crowning glory &QL; 
After Bill Farrell coached his Paradise Valley Trojans to the state
boys' 4A basketball title two years ago at America West Arena, he
searched the crowd for one person. His wife.
</P>
<P>
   They embraced. They wept.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the crowning glories,'' said Farrell, who
resigned as basketball coach this summer to take over the Paradise
Valley district's middle schools athletics program. ``I looked for
her first.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been through it all. The camps. The cabin trips. The
early breakfast runs. Hours of me coming home too late and her
turning off the tape machine in the middle of the night and
insisting I not watch it any more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like, maybe, without her, none of the championships,
none of that stuff, happens.'' &QL;

MCKINNON EARNS WINGS  
 LINEBACKER TO FACE EX-TEACHER HILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They had little in common, the 30-year-old former first-round
draft pick and the 23-year-old undrafted rookie from an NCAA
Division II program.
</P>
<P>
   But former Cardinals middle linebacker Eric Hill took linebacker
Ronald McKinnon under his wing from the first day they met in
minicamp two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the guys I truly was drawn to as a player,'' Hill
said Wednesday. ``One reason was he was one of those guys who came
in with all the odds against him. I knew he had the ability, and he
wanted to learn. He asked a lot of questions. We developed a
relationship, and now we're best of friends. I talk to the guy four
times a week.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, they'll be reunited but on opposite sides of the
field of the Trans World Dome in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Hill calls the signals for the Rams' defense. He left the
Cardinals after nine seasons to sign a two-year, $5.25 million
contract with the Rams as a free agent in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon has replaced him as the Cardinals middle linebacker and
has had a spectacular start. In three games, he has a team high 39
tackles, one sack, one interception, two forced fumbles and one
fumble recovery.
</P>
<P>
   He celebrated his 25th birthday last Sunday by sacking
Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Rodney Peete midway through the
fourth quarter and forcing a fumble that led to the go-ahead score
in the Cardinals' 17-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought (McKinnon) was (Hill's) little son,''
Cardinals center Mike Devlin said. ``He'd follow him around like a
little puppy dog. When he left, I said, `Your daddy isn't here to
protect you anymore.' This week, I told him it was time for the
baby eagle to leave the nest.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin credits Hill for some of McKinnon's
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric took to Ron McKinnon and Ron took to Eric,'' Tobin said.
``They have a very strong relationship. Eric helped Ron know how to
work, how to be a pro. Eric knew what it took to prepare for a game
and showed Ron.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon, considered small at 6 feet, 240 pounds, studied each
of Hill's moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to learn from great linebackers,'' McKinnon said.
``He taught me about the game. He taught me work ethic and that you
need to watch film on your day off, studying downs and distance and
tendencies. And the best way for me to take what I learned was to
do it on the football field.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon progressed so quickly, the Cardinals made him the
starting outside linebacker last season, a position he never had
played. He wound up leading the team in tackles with 145 and had
three interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of last season, the Cardinals made little effort to
re-sign Hill. They offered him a multiyear contract early last
season, but Hill rejected it. He didn't help his value when he
suffered a fractured ankle in the season opener and missed four
games.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the season, he said he would only leave for a
playoff contender but then surprised many when he signed with the
team that had the worst record in the NFL in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a mutual thing,'' Hill said of leaving the
Cardinals. ``Deep down inside, I knew Ron was developing to be the
player I knew he could be and he would be. They did offer me a
contract earlier. At that point in time, I wasn't comfortable
making a career decision, basically retiring there.
</P>
<P>
   ``By season's end, a 4-12, disheartening season, everybody got
what they wanted. It was not a breakup where everybody was
bad-mouthing or anything like that. I kind of went my way, and they
went their way, and there were no hard feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon suddenly was on his own when Hill left. He knew he
could do the job physically but felt he needed to become more of a
vocal leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never doubted my ability,'' said McKinnon, the Division II
Player of the Year in 1995 whose school, North Alabama, went 41-1
over his final three years there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a winner,'' he said. ``The last two years
when we've lost here, it was tough. I want to help us get this
thing turned around.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the two left for training camp in July, McKinnon and Hill
got together one last time for lunch and trash talking.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon told Hill how Cardinals center Aaron Graham would
dominate him this Sunday. Hill told McKinnon how the Rams offensive
linemen would make him look bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was laughing so hard, my stomach hurt,'' said agent Jordan
Feagan, who represents both players. &QL;

power decentralizatrion to strengthen the United Kingdom by
instituting a kind of quasi-federalism, the result as been to
actually at heat to the fires of independence. In the course of the
century, the British Empire, once one of the world's most powerful
and expansive political forces could enter the next century as ony
England and a few odd possessions. What does this mean? (Roughton,

   MEXICO-MASSACRE _ MEXICO CITY _ At 22, she paid a high price for
joining Mexico's student movement for freedom. On Oct. 2, 1968 _ on
the eve of the Olympic Games in Mexico _ Ana Ignacia Rodriguez was
in Mexico City's Plaza of the Three Cultures for a rally. As dusk
approached, bullets suddenly began to rain on the square, an
ancient pre-Colombian site also called Tlatelolco. ``Nacha,'' as
she was nicknamed, fled for her life as dozens, hundreds or even
thousands _nobody really knows _ were cut down by military bullets.
Within a couple of months, Nacha was detained and, along with other
students, sentenced to 16 years in prison on trumped up charges of
sedition and homicide. She served two years, part of a shocking
experience that scarred a generation and tarnished Mexico's
reputation around the world. Of all the student movements of1968,
Mexico's was perhaps the most violently repressed. Thirty years
later, Mexicans are preparing to commemorate this event, which
still remains shrouded in government secrecy. (Ferriss, Cox News

   CLINTON-AUTHORITY _ WASHINGTON _ The year was 1863, the nation
was torn by civil war and the president was struggling against
virulent forces ready to abandon the fight against a rebellion that
had split the country in two. With just 272 well-chosen words,
however, Abraham Lincoln rallied a weary people around the cause of
union and refined the purpose of their very nationhood, in what may
be the single greatest use in American history of the sheer weight
of one man's character and the authority of the office he holds. A
hundred and thirty five years after Lincoln's Gettysburg Address,
the nation is at odds once more, divided this time by the leader
himself, who's own moral authority is at the center of a battle
raging in Congress and the American public at large over whether
Bill Clinton is fit to serve. How important is moral authority to
the American presidency, where does it come from and how might
Clinton regain it if he remains in office? (Deans, Cox News Service
1500).

   GINGRICH _ President Clinton is not the only politician caught
in the impeachment cross-hairs. So is the Speaker. On one hand,
Gingrich must try to make the process appear as non-partisan as
possible if Republicans are to avoid any backlash. On the other
hand, he cannot appear too soft nor can he afford not to hold
hearings, given the unrest in the right wing of his own party and
his upcoming election for Speaker. It's a slippery path and one
that seems to lead almost inevitably to impeachment hearings.

   CONGRESS _ The impeachment ruckus has smothered everything on

<P>
   TELCOM-CONGRESS _ WASHINGTON _ The scorecard is mixed when it
comes to legislative and regulator opinion on all the consolidation
in the industry. Congress isn't sure if mergers are what it had
mind when it passed the 1996 Telcom bill. FCC commisioner William
Kennard seems to think that mergers could hasten univeral access to
the Internet. Why the split? What's the likely outcome as Congress
holds hearings on this issue? (Glass, Cox News Service).

   DISEASE-RESEARCH _ WASHINGTON _ With Congress and President
Clinton set to approve substantial increases in the research budget
of the National Institutes of Health, lobbying groups that

Society, for example _ are lining up their forces to grab as much

   BUILDING-WASTE _ WASHINGTON _ The project has been announced and
the cost set at a whopping $1.3 billion. Can citizen watchdog
groups now slow down the construction of an enormous new Patent and
Trademark Building that they have dubbed the ``Taj Mahal''?
Lawmakers, especially those from Northern Virginia where it would
be located, tried to quell the furor over the project last week by
allowing the critics to vent. But the project is on track anyway.
Foes say stopping it is crucial to stopping a tradition of waste
and extravagance in federal buildings, such as the recently
completed Ronald Reagan Building. (Malone, Cox News Service).

   BORISON-TRIAL _ Dr. Richard Borison, the former Medical College
of Georgia psychiatrist, goes on trial Monday (9/28) for allegedely
stealing more than $10 million in research dollars from MCG as part
of his controversial, off-campus operation that ran lucrative drug
trials for the nation's top pharmaceutical companies. Borison was
famous in his field and became wealthy through his scheme, with a
model in his office of an immense gothic mansion he was planning to
build. Borison's partner, Dr. Bruce Diamond pleaded guilty last
year and is already serving time. Borison's defense will argue that
this case should be a civil action, not a criminal trial.

   DAYTONA _ DAYTONA BEACH, Fla._ After Labor Day and the end of
the summer high season, Laura Pittman is accustomed to business
slowing down at the gift shop where she works. But this year's
slow-down comes after a summer in which Florida's wildfire crisis
devastated the normally busy June-July period. Even after the fires
were put out, many visitors stayed away, thinking the area was in
charred ruins, business owners say. Tourism officials hope to
recoup some of the losses with several big events this fall, but
business owners fear it will be too little too late. ``October will
be better than normal, but it can't replace July,'' said Patrick
Welsh, owner of the 10-room Beach House Motel, who suffered a 50
percent loss during July. (MWilliams, Atlanta

north of Florida, famous lobsters and mussels and miles and miles
of red and white sand beaches, PEI, as the locals call it, can seem
too good to be true: crisply painted farmhouses, lush green fields
rolling down to the water, and an active vacation season that lasts
well into the fall. Many were worried that the arrival of the
9-mile Confederation Bridge, which links PEI to New Brunswick,
would alter the centuries-old way of life here. But so far, though
traffic is up, the island's laid-back character remains
refreshingly unchanged. (Drennen, Atlanta JOurnal-Constitution).

intelligence does not always transfer to football smarts, while
other coaches say that because of the culturally biased tests,
bright kids don't always do well. Then there is Stanford, which has
excelled in both areas. (Fish, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) 55.

CARDINALS HAVE CHANCE TO SERVER OLD TIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The anger has faded over time, reduced to simple resentment. But
no one ever forgets an owner who packs his franchise into a moving
van and heads off down the road.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever forgets. And no one ever forgives.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, St. Louis will host the polar opposites of its
sporting experience. At Busch Stadium, Mark McGwire will take his
final curtain call of the year. At the TWA Dome, Bill Bidwill
returns for the first time in a regular-season game.
</P>
<P>
   Good and Evil. Paul Bunyan and Benedict Arnold. The favorite son
and the dastardly owner, separated by a few blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what he did, but he sure ticked a lot of people
off,'' said former Cardinal Eric Hill, now with the Rams. ``There
have been a lot of things said about Bidwill in the press, and it
has not been nice.'' &QL; 
subhed
</P>
<P>
   Say what you want about the man _ and they're saying a lot of
things in the Gateway City these days _ but Bidwill is never fazed
by criticism. Never bothered by public opinion. Asked if he's a bit
apprehensive about his return, he seemed offended by the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time that I've gone back there, I've never heard a nasty
word,'' Bidwill said. ``Everyone has been very nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Not this time. There will be unpleasant signs in the stands. A
rabid crowd looking for its pound of flesh. A reason for a great
sports town to vent, and already, the anti-Bidwill sentiment has
surfaced on talk radio in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them to annihilate the Big Red,'' one caller chirped on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It will not be a warm environment. But it's the perfect
opportunity for the Cardinals to shed the feathers of immaturity,
to leave their infamous past behind.
</P>
<P>
   Win, and they're back to even. Win, and they have two homes
games against teams with a combined record of 1-5. Win, and they
lose the turf monkey. Win, and they've jockeyed themselves into
early playoff contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the team that left, the team that is vilified back in
St. Louis,'' Coach Vince Tobin said. ``We're kind of removed from
it. They are the ones who are getting it every day, from the fans
and family who (are asking), `What are you going to do to the
Cardinals?' It's a big game. It's one that we need.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are 1-11 on artificial turf dating back to 1996.
They haven't been 2-2 since 1991. And the last time these two teams
played, the Cardinals scored 17 unanswered points to post a 31-28
victory in Tempe. A game that left St. Louis in a deep depression
that lasted a few days. A memory that only fuels the contempt. &QL; 
subhed
</P>
<P>
   Win under these conditions, and it virtually proves they're not
the same old birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always going to be people in St. Louis who will hold
animosity towards them,'' said Dan Lowe, general manager of
Dierdorf and Hart's restaurant. ``We haven't watched good football
since the '70s. It's tough for people to attach themselves to the
Rams because there's no history there. I think they wish the
Cardinal name was still in St. Louis, but I don't think anyone
misses Bill Bidwill.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, they won't hesitate to let him know.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the fans, this is going to be like a playoff-type
atmosphere here,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes this a significant milepost in the journey. A
game in which the Cardinals must prove they've changed, improved,
grown into the shape of a contender. A game in which they must
ignore the hazing and simply win a football game.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this other stuff, this mist in the air or bad blood, it's
not my problem,'' Eric Swann said. ``They can rally around what
they want to rally around. We're in a situation where we can take
it to another level.''
</P>
<P>
   A situation where one Redbird will be making history with his
bat, while another group of Cardinals fights for its future. ``My
game is more important than McGwire's game,'' Swann said, and he
just might be right. &QL;

<P>
   PHOENIX - Kenny Mitchell ran a quick out to college. Andrae
Holland opted for a deep route to the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   But their paths will cross Saturday night at Sun Devil Stadium.
Five years after the wide receivers helped lead Peoria High School
to an 11-1 record, they will line up across from one another when
Arizona State and Oregon State meet.
</P>
<P>
   Both are at pivotal points in their careers. Holland, now a
cornerback, has attracted NFL interest with a strong start to his
senior season. Mitchell, who has undergone an up-and-down career,
turned some heads Saturday against North Texas with an impressive
effort that included a 60-yard touchdown catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll look at him, he'll look at me, we'll remember the old
times, but it won't be a lot of trash talking,'' Mitchell said.
``We might say a few words, but most of it will be encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Holland said, ``We'll be enemies on the field. But off it, we'll
be friends again.''
</P>
<P>
   The two played on a Peoria High team ranked No. 1 much of the
season before falling in the second round of the playoffs to Tucson
Sabino in overtime. The team was stacked.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Johnson is now a linebacker at Washington. Tavon Cooper,
after transferring from Colorado, is Northern Arizona's top
tailback.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell and Holland won scholarships to Pac-10 schools despite
playing for a team that predominantly ran the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's to their credit,'' Peoria Athletic Director
Rick Johnson said. ``It says something about where blazing speed
and a great attitude can get you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers have fed players to a variety of Division I
schools. Ten have moved on since 1994 and 20 in the past eight
years, including former ASU standout Eric Guliford. Their track
record attracts attention to those who follow.
</P>

   Not that Mitchell or Holland needed much help.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, who was a year behind Holland in high school, caught
41 passes for 800 yards and eight touchdowns and helped lead Peoria
to the state title in 1994. He also was a state champion hurdler
and high jumper.
</P>
<P>
   He was named a ``Parade'' magazine All-American and was
recruited by most major colleges. But his career since has been one
wild ride.
</P>
<P>
   He'll make a great catch one game and disappear in another. His
success Saturday was celebrated by his teammates because the
happy-go-lucky senior is one of the team's most popular players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy he played that way,'' ASU receivers coach Robin
Pflugrad said. ``The thing that I like is that he took what we
talked about in meetings, as far as things he needed to improve,
and he attacked them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing now for him is consistency.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mitchell finds himself in a bit of a chicken-and-egg
quandary. In addition to being asked to play three receiving
positions, he finds himself playing sporadically because of the
depth at the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be hard to become consistent when you're not in there
regularly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though his struggles have made for ``some tough times in
the Mitchell household,'' his father, Kenneth Sr. said, Mitchell
remains upbeat. He often breaks into song at practice and is known
as one of the team's biggest jokesters.
</P>
<P>
   Although both are considered humble, Holland is more low key
than Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything he does is without noise,'' Beavers defensive backs
coach Mark Banker said. ``Other guys would have come in and said,
`Hey, look at me, I'm playing against an old teammate,' but I
didn't even know it. He's that kind of guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Oregon State was the only school to recruit him as a
defensive back, he opted to go there because it also was the only
Pac-10 school to offer him a scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Holland's family moved to the Valley from Florida before his
senior year. Peoria Coach Doug Clapp knew he had something special
when Holland took the first play of the first game into the end
zone for an 80-yard reception.
</P>
<P>
   He has started 22 consecutive games at Oregon State and is the
Beavers' top coverage back. He tied a school record with four
passes broken up against Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   NFL scouts like his speed. He ran a 4.35 and a 4.38 in the
40-yard dash for scouts during summer workouts, Banker said.
</P>
<P>
   It should make for an interesting meeting Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Credit goes to the community at Peoria High School,'' Mitchell
Sr. said. ``They really do a great job of preparing those kids.'' &QL; 
Note &QL; 
Sun Devils starting tight end Kendrick Bates injured his right
shoulder in Wednesday's practice. He is considered questionable for
Saturday's game with Oregon State. &QL;

MILLER GETS CAST; SURGERY CAN WAIT

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Cardinals linebacker Jamir Miller will not need
immediate surgery on his dislocated left wrist, doctors told him
Wednesday, and he could return to action as early as Sunday against
the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Wilson, an orthopedic hand surgeon, gave Miller the
go-ahead Wednesday to return to action as pain allows. The wrist
was placed in a cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tend to heal fast,'' Miller said. ``I might be up to the
task. It will depend on how I feel when I wake up (this) morning.
If I feel good, I'll see. If it doesn't feel good, I'm not going to
risk it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said Miller might need postseason surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Miller watched practice Wednesday. The Cardinals were concerned
that Miller, a co-captain, could be out eight to 10 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it wasn't that bad because I didn't have the pain to
support that,'' said Miller, who popped the bone back into place
after he was injured during the Cardinals' win over Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The cast would restrict the range of motion of Miller's wrist,
but he does not anticipate a problem wrapping up on a tackle. He
said his concern is whether he'll be able to ``punch like a boxer,
only with open hands'' to shed blockers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can do that reasonably well in practice, I'll probably
play Sunday,'' Miller said. ``If not, I'll probably have to sit a
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Patrick Sapp filled in admirably Sunday, the news
encouraged Coach Vince Tobin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so relieved that Jamir does not have to have surgery,''
Tobin said. ``That's excellent news. Nobody knows much about a
dislocated wrist. Obviously I'd rather not have him in a cast, but
I think he can make tackles.'' &QL;

BRAZIL MAKES FAST RECOVERY FROM BRINK OF ECONOMIC COLLAPSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: BRAZIL-CARDOSO) 
(cb) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Only two weeks ago Brazil's stock market was
crashing and its banking system was leaking currency reserves at a
rate of more than $2 billion a day. Financial collapse or a
crushing devaluation looked almost inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   But the panic that throttled this business and finance center
has subsided just as suddenly as it emerged as an outgrowth of the
currency crisis in Russia. At least temporarily, Brazil's stock
market and banking system appear to have stabilized, adding to the
evidence that the financial contagion spreading around the world is
linked to unpredictable flights of perception and mood that can
shift from one week to the next.
</P>
<P>
   No serious expert says Brazil is out of trouble yet. A recession
caused by high interest rates looks virtually inevitable in 1999,
and the government faces tough choices to reduce a fiscal deficit
that represents more than 7 percent of gross domestic product. But
the Brazilian stock market has recovered better than 50 percent
since Sept. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Volatility has subsided, with far lower daily trading volumes
until Wednesday, when the market shot up almost 11 percent, largely
in response to remarks in Washington by Alan Greenspan, the
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, suggesting that he might
favor lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   More important, local economists point out, the volume of
capital flight has slowed to a manageable, though still
troublesome, $500 million a day.
</P>
<P>
   As the ninth largest economy in the world and the principal
motor of Latin America's economic growth, Brazil's improving
fortunes have helped strengthen the Mexican peso, eased fears that
Argentina might have to remove its peso from a dollar peg, and led
a modest rally in most of the region's stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten days ago we were talking about the end of the world,''
said Mauro Schneider, vice president for economic research at ING
Barings here. ``Things could still change overnight, but you don't
see investors selling at any price anymore.'' Paulo Mallman,
finance director of BicBanco, a Brazilian bank, said: ``The panic
is over. Apparently the crisis has eased a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Such expressions reflect Brazil's continued vulnerability to
events outside its control, such as a potential stock market plunge
in the United States, a collapse of the new government in Russia,
or a reversal in the improving fortunes of the Japanese yen. But
they also seem to suggest that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso,
the Clinton administration, the International Monetary Fund and
other world lending institutions may have weeks or months _ rather
than days as some once feared _ to construct a coordinated
rebuilding effort based on new loans and slashing the Brazilian
government deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso sent mixed signals in recent weeks about whether he
would seek an IMF lending package, but in a speech Wednesday he
said it was ``in the country's interests to carve out'' a bailout
package. Experts believe such a package could include contributions
of up to $50 billion from the IMF, the World Bank and other
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian crisis peaked on Sept. 10 when the Brazilian stock
market plummeted 16 percent in a single day. On that Thursday and
Friday Brazilian and foreign businesses and individuals withdrew a
total of $4 billion from Brazilian banks. While the stock market
was down 50 percent for the year, the banking system's dollar
reserves had fallen from $74 billion to $51 billion over the course
of a single month.
</P>
<P>
   Panic set in when not even the government's doubling of interest
rates to better than 40 percent stemmed the tide of capital flight.
But the psychology began to change with a speech on Sept. 11 by
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, which broke weeks of silence from
the Clinton administration that had left investors confused about
United States policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The financial stability and prosperity of Brazil is of vital
importance to the U.S.,'' Rubin said in a statement. In the next
few days President Clinton and officials of the IMF and the Group
of Seven leading industrial countries declared they would stand by
Latin America, helping to reverse a growing impression among
businesses and investors that capital controls and a steep
devaluation of the Brazilian currency were imminent.
</P>
<P>
   After the calming words from abroad, said Bolivar Lamounier, a
political consultant to several banks here, ``people sat down and
thought through what they were doing.'' Several experts noted that
recent polls showing that Cardoso would win a landslide victory on
Oct. 4, giving him far more political clout to deal with the
crisis, also helped calm investors.
</P>
<P>
   Then last week the government bolstered its ailing accounts by
successfully completing privatization sales of a state bank and two
power companies worth more than than $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   After the privatizations, ING Barings released a report last
Friday suggesting that Brazil might be able to speed up
divestitures, including its huge oil company Petrobras and the
enormous commercial bank Banco do Brasil, to raise more needed
capital. The report concluded on a hopeful note, saying, ``Despite
the financial turmoil, foreign corporations still express great
interest in purchasing strategic concerns from the Brazilian
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Kawall L. Ferreira, Citibank's chief economist in Brazil,
said he was heartened by the deceleration of capital flight.
</P>
<P>
   He said most of the money now leaving the country was related to
stock sales or corporations paying off debts in anticipation of an
economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not seeing the same panic anymore,'' Ferreira said.
Still, noting that reserves had fallen to $47 billion, he added:
``My fear is the money will not come back in the next several weeks
or months. International support will be needed for Brazil.''

HICKS' JOB REVIEW OF OATES STARTS WITH W'S
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like with the rest of us, Tom Hicks has ridden along on the
Rangers' mystery roller coaster the past few weeks. Or really, for
the past few months.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond that, much separates Hicks from the rest of us. He
has two hundred and fifty million dollars and reasons to be
concerned/elated. From one game to the next, the Rangers keep
providing that wide emotional swing.
</P>
<P>
   As of yesterday morning, elated was Hicks' prevailing theme
after the team's strong performances the previous two nights in
Anaheim. A late-starting series wrapup last night with the Angels
was the most important game of the season. What's it going to be _
the Rangers with a three-game divisional lead with four to go in
Seattle? Or up by a very slim one game going into that concrete
house of horrors known as the Kingdome?
</P>
<P>
   Of most interest, however, is that Hicks, the new owner, and
Hicks, the longtime Rangers fan, remain totally noncommittal on the
question of future employment here for manager Johnny Oates and his
coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Do the Rangers have to win the American League West for Oates to
keep his job? Hicks isn't saying, and none of us knows Hicks well
enough to give an educated guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be unfair and not appropriate to comment on that at
this time,'' he said yesterday. ``When this season is over, then
comes the time to sit down with Doug (Melvin, the general manager)
and evaluate players, management, everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm going to get ahead of myself, what I like to think
about is being in New York next week, getting ready to open the
playoffs against the Yankees. But then reality sets in when I start
thinking about four games in Seattle to end the season. Those scare
me to death.''
</P>
<P>
   The first time Hicks asks my opinion (and you shouldn't skip
lunch waiting breathlessly) I'd say, without reservation, that
Oates deserves to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Oates has kept the lid on a team that is one of the strangest in
franchise annuals. It is certainly good enough to win this
particular division and should have wrapped it up weeks ago. But
there is no pattern when it comes to on-the-field mentality or
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   One forever knock on the Rangers' organization is there has
never been a demand to win, win, win. Not from previous ownership,
not from the fans, not from the local media. Attendance is always
high, but expectations are not. Ownership makes money, the fans and
the media may grumble over record, but in the end nothing changes.
</P>
<P>
   Compare that to the Cowboys ... well, don't. There is no
comparison in expectations. Frankly, the Rangers have been allowed
to skate.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks said from the start, ``Winning is the priority.'' Everyone
who ever passed though Arlington had the same words, but if Hicks
was not taken seriously, it was a mistake. In the previous 26
years, any manager who had the Rangers on the division lead in the
last week of the season would have already had his contract
extended by a year or two. Oates has a contract for next year, but
at the moment that even is in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Is is fair? Heck, yeah. It's fair because it lets everyone know
there's a new sheriff and priority in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, is Hicks about to become a dreaded meddler? Why
doesn't he allow his baseball people, meaning Melvin, to make these
ultimate baseball decisions? If Melvin makes enough wrong
decisions, fire him and bring in someone else as GM. Pretty simply,
huh?
</P>
<P>
   Hicks' track record with the Stars says he won't meddle. But
that same track record says when a hockey season is over, Hicks
sits down with Bob Gainey and Ken Hitchcock and privately asks hard
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's hockey, a game rather foreign to Hicks' Port
Arthur roots. There is not a man/boy in America over the age of 16
who doesn't think he can run a baseball team, Jim Reeves and me
included.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in Arlington, Hicks missed a comeback win over the
Angels because of a charity event in Dallas. The next night, he was
at a Friday night high school football game to watch son Mack, a
linebacker for Dallas St. Mark's, and he missed a win over the A's.
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday and Sunday Hicks watched with discomfort at The
Ballpark in Arlington as the Rangers lost to the A's and saw a
two-game lead in the West disappear. ``I was very concerned,'' he
said. ``We didn't play like a team that wanted to win. The same
mental errors were being made.''
</P>
<P>
   After strong overall performances in Anaheim on Monday and
Tuesday, Hicks admitted he took the roller-coast ride _ again.
``That looked like a championship team,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anything other than that, however, and this will be an owner
ready with the tough questions and/or decisions. Only winning is
now acceptable.

UCLA FROSH TO MISS HIS HOMECOMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since he signed a letter of intent to play at UCLA,
 &UR; Freddie
 &UR; Mitchell has looked forward to returning to his home state of
Florida to play Miami.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bruins leave today for Saturday's game against the
Hurricanes, Mitchell won't be with them. The wide receiver/return
specialist broke his left leg against Houston in one of the most
disturbing televised injuries since &UR; Joe Theismann's horrific break
as Washington Redskins quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   It occurred at the end of a 47-yard punt return Saturday while
Mitchell was tackled at the UCLA sideline by the Cougars'  &UR; David
 &UR; Williams. Mitchell's bone snapped, and it could be seen protruding
against his pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was devastating,'' Bruins Coach  &UR; Bob Toledo said. ``Not for
us, although obviously he was important to the team, but for him.
He was excited about the season.''
</P>
<P>
   The popular redshirt freshman sat out last year to concentrate
on academics. In his college debut against Texas, he accounted for
267 yards. He threw a touchdown pass, caught a touchdown pass, ran
a reverse and returned punts and kickoffs.
</P>
<P>
   He underwent surgery in a Houston hospital and had a rod and two
screws inserted into his femur, the bone that extends from the hip
to the knee. The Bruins have not said when or whether Mitchell will
be back. &QL; 
Around the Pac &QL; 
Why is Washington State somewhat tepid about its 3-0 start? Because
the Cougars struggled at times in all three games against teams
ranked by ``The Sporting News'' at 98th (Illinois), 101st (Boise
State) and 112th (Idaho).
</P>
<P>
   Washington State's wins were by an average of nine points, and
it never covered the spread in those games.
</P>
<P>
   Southern California might want to order out once the Trojans
check into their Tallahassee, Fla., hotel tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Duke officials believe 25 Blue Devils football players acquired
food poisoning from their pre-game meal Saturday at the Ramada Inn,
the same place USC will stay for its game against Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   Duke lost, 62-13.
</P>
<P>
   After going 8-0 in nonconference games last weekend, it will be
interesting to see how the league handles this week's challenges.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to UCLA at Miami and USC at Florida State,
Washington plays at Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   After giving up 442 yards of offense in a victory over Houston,
UCLA is revamping its secondary.
</P>
<P>
   All-American  &UR; Larry Atkins is moving from strong safety to free
safety.  &UR; Tod McBride replaces Atkins at the strong spot, while
 &UR; Ryan
 &UR; Roques takes over for  &UR; Marques Anderson at left cornerback.
Overall, UCLA will have six new starters for Saturday's game
against Miami. &QL; 
Keep an eye on ... &QL; 
Washington State wide receiver  &UR; Nian Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   The senior caught eight passes for 254 and three touchdowns
against Idaho. One was a school-record 87-yard pass play from
quarterback
 &UR; Steve Birnbaum. &QL; 
Who's hot &QL; 
USC.
</P>
<P>
   We'll learn more about the Trojans during Saturday's game at
Florida State, but you've got to like a team that leads the
conference in total defense, giving up only 264.7 yards a game (and
only four touchdowns in three games).
</P>
<P>
   If the Trojans can survive the Seminoles, their next three games
are against unranked league teams: Arizona State, California and
Washington State. &QL; 
Who's not &QL;
</P>
<P>
   California.
</P>
<P>
   After they square off with 3-0 Washington State Saturday, the
Golden Bears play No. 18 USC, No. 9 Washington and No. 3 UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   While the defense has been solid, the offense isn't going
anywhere. &QL; 
Parting shots &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Credit Arizona's offensive line with playing a large role in the
team's 3-0 start.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats rank 17th in the country in total offense. The line
has given up only three sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Go figure. Oregon led San Jose State, 21-0, after one quarter
Saturday, even though the offense was on the field for only 1:16. A
punt return and an interception return accounted for two of the
scores. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Eight years after New Jersey enacted one of the nation's
strictest bans on assault weapons, gun control advocates and the
National Rifle Association have turned the state legislature into a
testing ground in the newest battle over gun control, the push for
high-tech personalized handguns that are designed to fire only if
the owner personally pulls the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Several gun control groups are lobbying legislators in Trenton
to pass what would be the nation's first ``childproof gun'' bill,
which would require that any handguns sold in the state include
so-called smart-gun technology.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the systems they envision use a tiny radio device
embedded in the gun handle that prevents the weapon from firing
unless activated by another transmitter in the owner's ring or
lapel pin.
</P>
<P>
   A gun control organization, Ceasefire New Jersey, is planning a
radio campaign to muster public support and has also scheduled a
visit Thursday by James S. Brady, the former White House press
secretary who was wounded in 1981 during the assassination attempt
on President Ronald Reagan and later lobbied Congress to enact the
a bill that bore his name, requiring a waiting period before the
purchase of handguns.
</P>
<P>
   But the National Rifle Association and other groups representing
New Jersey gun owners have vowed to oppose the legislation, saying
it unfairly limits the right to buy a gun by mandating technology
that is not even available.
</P>
<P>
   An NRA lobbyist helped block the proposal from moving out of
committee last spring, and lobbyists are confident that they can
prevent it from being approved when the measure is again considered
this fall. The powerful Coalition of New Jersey Sportsmen has also
vowed to oppose any legislator who votes for the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbying campaign, which is expected to intensify throughout
the fall, illustrates how technology has expanded the gun control
debate from the constitutional issue of the right to own handguns
to the less polarized matter of product safety.
</P>
<P>
   It also demonstrates how some gun manufacturers have embraced
the prospect of computerized handguns as a way of increasing their
market while avoiding the kind of costly product-liability lawsuits
that have been directed at tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate is also likely to show how far New Jersey's
political landscape has shifted in the eight years since Gov. Jim
Florio, a Democrat, ushered the assault weapons ban through the
state's Democratic-controlled legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman defeated Florio in 1993 with enthusiastic
support from the NRA, and although she disappointed gun advocates
by balking at their request to repeal the assault weapons ban, Mrs.
Whitman has done little to strengthen gun laws during her tenure.
</P>
<P>
   The state legislature, which came under Republican control in
1991, presents another daunting challenge, and supporters of the
``smart gun'' proposal question whether the bill will even make it
out of committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a tough haul,'' said state Sen. Joseph A.
Palaia, a Republican of Monmouth County who is co-sponsoring the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Although gun manufacturers have produced mechanical trigger
locks and safety grips for more than a century, the push for the
new generation of high-tech guns has arisen only in the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
   One company is working on a prototype that would implant a
computer chip in the handle of each gun and program it to recognize
the owner's fingerprint. Another manufacturer is developing a model
that can recognize the size of the owner's hand. The weapon closest
to mass production uses a radio transponder in the handle that has
to be activated by another radio device in a ring.
</P>
<P>
   Gun safety advocates say the devices could save thousands of
lives each year by preventing teen-age suicides and accidental
shootings involving children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to take anyone's gun away,'' said Bryan
Miller, executive director of Ceasefire New Jersey. ``We're trying
to be certain that gun owners' weapons aren't used by people who
aren't supposed to use them.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the NRA and New Jersey's leading gun-owners' rights
group say they support the development of new safety devices, but
contend that it is unconstitutional for the state to mandate their
use. Richard Miller, chairman of the Coalition of New Jersey
Sportsmen, said that the measure unfairly restricts gun owners'
right to choose.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say you can only buy a gun if it has this thing, this
technology that doesn't exist,'' said Richard Miller, chairman of
the Coalition of New Jersey Sportsmen. ``That's a gun ban. It's
unconstitutional and it will never pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill, in fact, say it would not take effect
until three years after it is signed into law, a delay that they
say would give the gun industry reasonable time to market the
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Viden, an NRA board member who heads the New Jersey Rifle
and Pistol Association, said gun rights groups hope that by
scuttling the New Jersey bill they can discourage similar efforts
in other states. As a compromise, NRA leaders are asking the state
to enact two far more modest proposals: giving rebates or tax
breaks to gun owners who voluntarily buy trigger locks, manual
devices that fit existing weapons and cost about $12.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the trigger lock proposals have been embraced by the
state's three most important officials: Mrs. Whitman, Assembly
Speaker Jack Collins and Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, many smart-gun advocates still contend their best hope
lies in New Jersey, which has some of the strictest gun control
measures in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can help the public to view this as a public health
problem, and not just a constitutional issue the way the NRA
portrays it, then things will eventually change,'' Miller said.

UA TRIES NOT TO LOOK (OR LISTEN) AHEAD

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The temptation is there. Arizona only has to look at
a couple of schedules and tonight's opponent, battered and winless
San Diego State.
</P>
<P>
   Take a peek beyond the immediate task and the No. 16 Wildcats
can see a real chance at becoming more than an intriguing,
uncertain collection of potential.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 3, the Wildcats play at Washington. It will be the
Huskies' first game after a difficult test Saturday at Nebraska.
What's more, the Cats will have an extra few days to prepare for
that one.
</P>
<P>
   It's an unusual opportunity on an unusual Arizona schedule,
which includes two Thursday night games. It also includes potential
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   College football's landscape is littered with good teams that
lost in September because of plans for October. The Wildcats know
the danger. But avoiding it can be difficult, especially when media
and fans are talking about nothing but Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Fair or not, tonight's game with San Diego State (5:05 kickoff
on ESPN) at Qualcomm Stadium has all the appearances of a tune-up
for the Wildcats, 15-point favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington is out there, but hey, we're competitors,'' said
Arizona running back Trung Canidate, a former Central High School
star who scored a 97-yard touchdown last year in a Wildcats victory
over San Diego State. ``San Diego State has some good, physical
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys we'll see are better athletes, quicker than anybody
we've seen this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   But the Aztecs are 0-2 after losses to Wisconsin and Southern
California and are another questionable commodity in the Western
Athletic Conference, a league that provided the Wildcats with a
season-opening victory at winless Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Aztecs' best players, running back Jonas Lewis, is
not expected to play because of a sprained ankle. He suffered the
injury 12 days ago in a loss to USC, but San Diego State Coach Ted
Tollner said Tuesday that he has yet to recover. Sophomore Larry
Nest is scheduled for his first start.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback position is even more troublesome. Untested
Brian Russell, a transfer from Pennsylvania, will start in place of
Spencer Brinton, out because of a thumb injury suffered against
USC.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Brinton makes an unexpected recovery, one of the biggest
threats to Arizona may be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   In a victory over Iowa on Saturday, the Wildcats gave up 393
passing yards to a freshman QB. And the Arizona secondary is
hobbled. Strong safety LeChaux Rich is not expected to play because
of an ankle sprain.
</P>
<P>
   Rich's backup, Leland Gayles, is ailing with a bad shoulder.
Free safety Rafell Jones also has a shoulder injury. Gayles and
Jones are expected to play, along with untested junior Greg Payne,
who had been ticketed for a redshirt season.
</P>
<P>
   They make an inviting target for an opposing quarterback. But
Russell has yet to prove he's a threat. His passing statistics: 8
for 21 for 89 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Russell) will be much more able to handle the challenge
with two weeks of work,'' said Tomey, who has expressed concern
about the extra practice time San Diego State has had since its
loss Sept. 6 to USC. ``They may throw a lot of new stuff at us. I
know we have seen two-back offenses, we have seen one-back
offenses, no-back offenses, an option offense and lot of other
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what they would decide to do that we haven't
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Or heard.
</P>
<P>
   Whispers about Washington might be San Diego State's best
weapon. &QL;

THIS CONFERENCE IS WAC'ED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you haven't heard any cries of protest since last May's
announcement about the dismantling of the Western Athletic
Conference, there's a perfectly acceptable explanation. The WAC's
scheduled self-destruction is looking more like a mercy killing
these days than a trampling of tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at last week's highlights: Wisconsin 52, UNLV 7;
Oregon 58, San Jose State 3; Arkansas 44, SMU 17; New Mexico State
28, New Mexico 27.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a conference, it's a nonconference.
</P>
<P>
   The WAC went 0 for 8 outside the league and is 10-21 (.323) in
nonleague games against Division I-A competition. Only four teams
have winning records, including New Mexico (2-1), which lost to Big
West weakling New Mexico State for only the fifth time in 30 years;
Air Force (3-0), which returned only nine starters, and Tulsa
(2-0), which was picked to finish last in the eight-team Mountain
Division after going 2-9 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The other winner is Utah (3-0), and even the Utes blew a 20-0
halftime lead before earning a 30-21 win over Hawaii, which has
lost 21 straight WAC road games.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the conference's misery is producing its share of
pathetic moments:
</P>
<P>
   __ New Mexico, which captured the WAC Mountain Division title
last year and made its first bowl appearance in 36 years, lost to
the Aggies on a 50-yard touchdown pass with 20 seconds remaining.
All this only three days after Lobos assistant coach Kevin Faulkner
resigned after losing an appeal on a charge of patronizing a
prostitute in May.
</P>
<P>
   __ One day after its charter plane was forced to make an evasive
dive to dodge a military jet near Boise, Idaho, Brigham Young shut
out Brock Huard and Washington's offense in the last three quarters
only to lose 20-10 on fumble and kickoff returns.
</P>
<P>
   __ And then there was Fresno State, which suffered a last-minute
goal-line fumble for the second week in a row in another heartbreak
loss to a Big 12 Conference opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Bulldogs quarterback Billy Volek lost a fumble on
the 1-yard line with 22 seconds to go in a 29-21 loss at Colorado.
Then, last Saturday, senior tailback Jaime Kimbrough _ who hadn't
fumbled in two years _ had his fumble returned 1 yard for a
touchdown by linebacker Kyle Shipley with 48 seconds remaining in a
34-28 loss to Texas Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect the new conference that will be created after the
breakup to be anywhere near super either. So far, the breakaway
eight are just 12-11. The remaining eight teams are 5-14.
</P>
<P>
   __ No-sunshine state: With Florida and Miami both losing in
overtime Saturday, the Big Three from the state find themselves in
unusual territory. Florida State lost to North Carolina State last
week, so all three teams have a loss.
</P>
<P>
   It's been 17 years since at least one of three were unable to
escape the first month of the season without a defeat. Since then,
at least one of the Big Three has always made it to October with
hope of an undefeated season. Until this year.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time since 1990, none of the Big Three are
ranked among the nation's top five. The Hurricanes have not been
among the top five since the 1994 season, when they last contended
for the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   __ Turf wars: As Saturday night turned into Sunday morning,
Tennessee fans wandered joyously, clutching clumps of sod or
piecesof hedge, souvenirs of their team's biggest football victory
in years, an overtime decision over Florida.
</P>
<P>
   School officials estimated more than $20,000 damage to seating,
turf, goal posts and fencing. They have ordered two replacement
goal posts from a company in Kansas City for $3,500 each.
</P>
<P>
   __ Mumme ball: No coach is more creative than Kentucky's Hal
Mumme. Since Mumme's arrival last season, Kentucky has tried
fivefake punts and been successful on four. The Wildcats scored on
a fake puntto spark a comeback win against Indiana last week.
</P>
<P>
   __ Feudin' at Mizzou: Larry Smith at odds with his quarterback?
Doesn't sound possible. But the Missouri coach and his quarterback,
Corby Jones, are trading jabs after Jones attempted just 11 passes
in a 35-14 loss to No. 1-ranked Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's sick,'' Jones said. ``We were too much in a KU mode
(Mizzou rushed for 401 yards _ tailback Devin West for 319 _ in a
41-23 win over Kansas). Everybody knows we're not going to be able
to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Responded Smith: ``I've watched them practice. There's no reason
to have any confidence in our passing game. We say we do, but we
don't. I'm not going to call things I don't have confidence in.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jones' comments, Smith said, ``If Corby's upset, he needs to
come to me.''
</P>
<P>
   __ That's where they are: Wonder why USC's offensive line is
considered a weakness?
</P>
<P>
   Consider that three offensive linemen the Trojans recruited two
years ago _ redshirt freshmen Erin Huizingh and Victor Rogers and
junior college transfer Brad Bedell _ will be starting Saturday for
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   __ Aggie woes: Texas A&AMP;M might have to forfeit its 28-7 victory
over Louisiana Tech on Sept. 12. The school is conducting an
internal investigation into the eligibility of running back D'Andre
Hardeman, who was suspended indefinitely before the Aggies' victory
at Southern Miss Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Hardeman played in A&AMP;M's first two games _ a loss to Florida
State and the Louisiana Tech victory. The inquiry reportedly
centers on Hardeman's eligibility based on NCAA degree progress
rules.

TEXAN TIED TO BIN LADEN HELD WITHOUT BAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: See also BRITAIN-BINLADEN-ARRESTS.) 
(cb) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Texan who worked as a close aide to Osama bin
Laden, the Saudi exile suspected in the embassy bombings last month
in Africa, was ordered held without bond on Wednesday after the
authorities accused him of buying firearms for a defendant
convicted in the World Trade Center bombing in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors in Manhattan also asserted that the Texan,
Wadih el Hage, was linked to El Sayyid Nosair, who was convicted on
federal charges in the death of Rabbi Meir Kahane in 1990 and
convicted in 1995 of conspiracy in a plot to blow up New York City
landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   The government also said el Hage was connected to the
disappearance and death of at least two other people in New York
and Arizona in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The new allegations were issued in a bail hearing in U.S.
District Court in which Magistrate Judge Leonard Bernikow agreed
with government arguments that el Hage, who has been at the
Metropolitan Correction Center, might flee.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage was charged with 11 counts of lying in the investigation
into bin Laden and his organization, al Qaeda.
</P>
<P>
   In making the assertions a prosecutor offered few specifics, and
added nothing to establish that el Hage had a direct role in the
embassy attacks in Kenya and Tanzania, in which more than 250
people died and hundreds were injured. The prosecutor did say el
Hage was a close associate of two men accused in the bombing,
Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, who was arrested last month, and Haroun
Fazil, a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   As a result the allegations deepened the mystery surrounding el
Hage, 38, who manages a tire shop in Fort Worth. He was arrested
last week.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage, an American citizen, has emerged as a critical figure
in the inquiry, and the charges may be a calculated attempt to put
pressure on him to cooperate with the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage said nothing in court Wednesday. His lawyer, Bruce
McIntyre, rejected the government's assertions, saying that el
Hage, the father of 7 children, voluntarily traveled to New York
last week when the Federal Bureau of Investigation subpoenaed him
and that he was unlikely to flee.
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre said that bin Laden was someone who also had
``legitimate commercial interests'' and that el Hage had worked for
bin Laden in connection with those interests, and ``not his
terrorist activities.''
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre added that his client had not been charged with
terrorism, saying, ``El Hage is not charged with any violent
acts.''
</P>
<P>
   An assistant United States attorney, Patrick J. Fitzgerald,
depicted el Hage as an active international terrorist whose
incentive would only be to flee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secret is out about his involvement with the group,''
Fitzpatrick said. ``The organization knows how to extract people.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick told the magistrate that el Hage had been an
extremely valuable associate of bin Laden because he had obtained
his United States citizenship and was able to travel more freely
than others in the bin Laden organization.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald also told Magistrate Bernikow that el Hage was adept
at obtaining illegal travel documents for other members of al
Qaeda. The prosecutor added that in terrorist attacks on United
States and United Nations forces in Somalia in 1993 and 1994, el
Hage ``helped support some of those people with passports and the
ability to travel.''
</P>
<P>
   In linking el Hage to other cases of terrorism and murder,
Fitzgerald offered little elaboration and did not suggest that el
Hage was involved in the World Trade Center bombing or the other
deaths. But he appeared to be raising questions about el Hage's
associations.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald said at one point that el Hage had ``made an effort
to obtain firearms'' for Mahmoud Abouhalima, who was convicted in
the World Trade Center bombing, in which six people died and
hundreds were injured. Fitzgerald indicated, however, that after el
Hage had bought the guns, Abouhalima never picked them up.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald did not say when the purchases were made or whether
they were connected to the plot to blow up the Trade Center or any
other conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   In asserting that el Hage had contact with Nosair, the
prosecutor offered no details about the nature or timing of such an
association.
</P>
<P>
   Nosair was acquitted of the murder of Rabbi Kahane after a state
trial in 1991. But he was convicted in the death on a federal
charge of murder in aid of racketeering in 1996. In 1995, Nosair
was also convicted of seditious conspiracy, along with Sheik Omar
Abdel Rahman and other defendants, for plotting a series of
bombings of landmarks in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald also suggested that the government had evidence that
indirectly tied el Hage to a mysterious death in 1991 in Brooklyn.
He said that el Hage had gone to New York that year to direct the
Alkifah Refugee Center. The center, based in Brooklyn, raised money
and recruited and trained fighters in support of the rebels in the
Afghan war.
</P>
<P>
   The day that el Hage arrived, Fitzgerald said, the man who had
run the center, Mustafa Shalabi, disappeared. About a week later he
was found slain.
</P>
<P>
   In a fourth case in the early 90's, Fitzgerald said, el Hage had
helped a man who was conducting surveillance on a radical Islamic
leader in Arizona. The leader was later slain, Fitzgerald said.

COLLEGE FOES READY TO FACE OFF IN PROS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - RTheirs were classic Big Ten wars during their
college days. On Sunday, Cardinals defensive end  &UR; Simeon Rice and
St. Louis Rams left tackle  &UR; Orlando Pace renew their rivalry for
the first time as pros at the TWA Dome in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, the third pick in the 1996 draft and the NFL Defensive
Rookie of the Year that season, was an All-American at Illinois.
Pace, the first player chosen in the 1997 draft, won every major
award except the Heisman Trophy while playing at Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orlando was the best talent I ever went against in college,''
Rice said Wednesday. ``He obviously has great potential. I think he
can be as good as  &UR; Lomas (Brown, Cardinals seven-time Pro Bowl left
tackle) or  &UR; Larry Allen (Dallas Cowboys Pro Bowl player). His feet
are good, not great, but he's strong off the ball like Larry Allen.
Orlando could be a combination of those two guys. With the ability
he has, he'll go a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice was one of the quickest foes he ever faced, Pace said _
``Nobody I played in college was as hard to block'' _ quick enough
to avoid being the victim of one of Pace's signature ``pancake''
blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Rice said with a smile. ``Never. Nobody pancakes me.
That's my rule.'' &QL; 
Holcombe to start &QL; 
The Rams announced that they won't re-sign &UR; Lawrence Phillips, but
they will have a new starting tailback in Mesa High graduate
 &UR; Robert Holcombe.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams' running back situation was thrown back into disarray
when
 &UR; Greg Hill broke his leg in the fourth quarter of a 34-33 win at
Buffalo on Sunday. He is expected to miss at least eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Holcombe, the team's second-round draft pick from Illinois, will
become the third player in four games to start at running back.
Holcombe hasn't played since the preseason _ he has been inactive
for all three games. &QL; 
It's an honor &QL; 
Meanwhile Wednesday, the league confirmed that Rice is the NFC
Defensive Player of the Week after his two sacks ended his
nine-game drought in the Cardinals' 17-3 win over Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate that,'' Rice said. ``It was hard-fought. I didn't
fall into it. It took a lot of work to get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never questioned that I was going to get sacks. I knew great
things were going to come. Last year was a building year for me.'' &QL; 
Owie report &QL; 
Wide receiver  &UR; Rob Moore (hamstring) did not practice and remains
questionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will probably be a game day decision,'' Tobin said of
Moore's fate. ``He's about where he was at the beginning of last
week. What concerns you is that he is not getting any better.''
</P>
<P>
   Backup cornerback and special teams demon  &UR; J.J.
 &UR; McCleskey will have arthroscopic surgery on his right knee today to
clean out loose cartilage. Players typically are out at least two
weeks after such procedures. &QL;

MOTOROLA CUT TING TIES TO PHOENIX OPEN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Motorola, which only this year became the title
sponsor of the Phoenix Open, will terminate its agreement with the
Thunderbirds a year early and discontinue its sponsorship after the
1999 event, officials announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola officials said they made the decision in order to
pursue more globally oriented sports and entertainment
sponsorships. Officials also pointed to the need to reduce costs
because of a downturn in the semiconductor products industry.
</P>
<P>
   The company announced earlier this month that it will also
withdraw its sponsorship of the PGA Tour's Motorola Western Open
after the 1999 event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Phoenix Open has been a tremendous vehicle for exposure in
the Phoenix market thanks to the partnership of Motorola and the
Thunderbirds,'' said Bill Seiferth, a senior vice president for
Motorola. ``. . . Going forward, we need to pursue a sponsorship
strategy that will provide Motorola with a visibility on a global
scale, while being mindful of the current weakness in the
semiconductor marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Artigue, general chairman of the 1999 Phoenix Open, said,
``While the Thunderbirds regret that Motorola will not return in
2000, we understand the company's position. And we are pleased that
they will continue to be involved in the Open, even if it is in a
reduced role.'' &QL;

   NEW YORK _ With Rep. Charles Schumer at her side, Hillary Rodham
Clinton started a three-day national campaign tour on Wednesday by
characterizing Sen. Alfonse D'Amato as a ``Jesse Helms clone'' who
had repeatedly voted to keep women ``down and back'' during his 18
years in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing at once spirited and sober, the first lady glided from
a luncheon fund-raiser at a nightclub in midtown Manhattan to a
basement shelter for battered women on Manhattan's Lower East Side,
using every venue to assail D'Amato and talk up the credentials of
his opponent in the New York Senate race, Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton described Schumer, D-Brooklyn, as one of President
Clinton's most steadfast supporters in Congress, crediting him with
supporting legislation to curb crime and benefit women. By
contrast, Mrs. Clinton referred to D'Amato, who once spearheaded
congressional investigations into the Clintons' Whitewater land
dealings, only as ``Chuck's opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fair to say that Chuck's opponent has voted in a
way that puts him in the same category as those in the Senate who
are consistently voting to keep women down and back,'' Mrs. Clinton
said at the $1,000-a-head fund-raiser for Schumer's campaign, where
she criticized D'Amato's stance on abortion. ``His voting record on
choice is the same as Jesse Helms.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``The people of New York need to know that you do not
need a Jesse Helms clone in the United States Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip to New York by Mrs. Clinton signaled a new public role
for the first lady in the fall congressional races: she will
campaign in five states over three days, part of what her press
secretary, Marsha Berry, described as ``her fall initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   The eagerness with which Schumer embraced her on Wednesday _ in
contrast to the reluctance many Democrats have showed to appearing
with her husband since he acknowledged an affair with a White House
intern _ left little doubt that the first lady would fill the
election season role that in normal times would have been assumed
by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Although the president is also campaigning on behalf of
congressional candidates through the weekend, most of his
appearances are closed to cameras, often by the choice of the local
candidates themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, D'Amato countered Mrs. Clinton by sharing a dais
with Clinton and President Nelson Mandela at a ceremony in the
congressional rotunda honoring the South African leader. D'Amato
won his spot after Sen. Trent Lott, the Republican leader, yielded
the high-profile seat to D'Amato, an unstated political boost to a
senator who many Republicans feel is facing tough going in his bid
for a fourth term.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But D'Amato and his campaign _ while contributing to what has
become a daily stream of invective on paper and on television from
both candidates _ declined to comment on the first lady's remarks.
Instead, D'Amato's press secretary, Harvey Valentine, offered a
list of testimonials from women to D'Amato, including one from
Susan Molinari, the former Republican representative from Staten
Island, and assailed Schumer for attacking D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck Schumer has given up all pretense of running a campaign
on issues,'' said Valentine, reading from a prepared statement.
``It's said that he's decided to go completely negative.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine declined to go beyond the prepared remarks.
</P>
<P>
   The visit by Mrs. Clinton provided Schumer a chance to win both
attention and money; his aides said he raised $250,000 at the
fund-raiser at Tatou, a converted 1920s opera house where Desi
Arnez used to perform. But most important, it allowed Schumer, with
an extraordinary large assist from Mrs. Clinton, to directly appeal
to a group of voters that both Schumer and D'Amato consider
critical to the outcome of this year's election: Women.
</P>
<P>
   Both Schumer and Mrs. Clinton made particular mention of
D'Amato's opposition to abortion rights. In addition, they argued
that D'Amato had opposed legislation sponsored by Schumer that
would impose penalties for domestic violence. Valentine said that
D'Amato had voted against the legislation only because it was part
of a larger Democratic crime bill that included spending on social
programs.
</P>
<P>
   While D'Amato treated Mrs. Clinton's gingerly, his Democratic
opponent glowed as he sat at her side _ first at the fund-raiser
and then at a round-table discussion with victims of domestic
violence.
</P>
<P>
   At the fund-raiser, Schumer attacked D'Amato in the kind of
harsh language that has come to mark this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in for a tough, tough fight,'' he said, speaking to a
room filled with contributors. ``We are up against an opponent who
knows no shame, who will try to distort my record beyond
recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton was nearly as strong in her language as Schumer,
using this appearance _ which will be followed by campaign stops in
Denver, Seattle, Portland and San Francisco _ to assume a strong
partisan stance in a particularly contested election and against a
politician to who created much difficulty for her while he was
running the Senate Whitewater investigation. D'Amato backed out of
his role on the Senate investigating committee amid signs that it
was hurting him politically in New York, where Clinton remains
popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really important that people of New York look at Chuck's
opponent's record for his entire term, not a year in which he runs
for re-election,'' Mrs. Clinton said, her face set and intense.
``What is important is what he does every single day: Aligning
himself with the Republican leadership, voting down the line with
people who don't represent the interests of the mainstream voters
of New York. Whether it is Medicare or whether it is choice, he is
on the wrong side of New York and of women.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Mrs. Clinton's appearance seemed certain to provide a
boost to Schumer, it at times overshadowed him as well. This was a
rare trip by the first lady on her own since Clinton acknowledged
his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. She drew a warmer reception
than Schumer at the fund-raiser; she also drew a larger crowd of
reporters than would normally turn out for a visit by a first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton appeared at times dazed and distant as she sat in
on the panel, with victims of domestic violence and then toured a
computerized mail sorting facility at the shelter. She offered no
response when a local television reporter, standing directly in
front of her, inquired twice if he might ask Mrs. Clinton a
question. By contrast, one of Mrs. Clinton's aides grabbed the
reporter's arm and demanded that he stop trying to talk to the her.

   GREENSPAN SUGGESTS FED MAY CUT RATES
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, suggested
to the Senate Budget Committee that the central bank would
seriously consider cutting interest rates when it meets Tuesday.
Although he cautioned that the decision was not his alone, it was
Greenspan's strongest indication yet that he is leaning toward
lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said the global crisis was threatening the nation's
long economic expansion, and named developments over the last
several months that could slow growth. They included the decline in
the stock market, a reduction in lending by banks and a general
rise in financial uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   HEDGE FUND RECEIVES CASH INFUSION
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has helped organize a
rescue of Long-Term Capital Management, a large and prominent hedge
fund, suggesting that regulators were worried that a collapse of
the fund would have had a grave impact on banks and brokerage firms
already struggling with huge losses from turmoil in markets
worldwide. The move suggested that the Federal Reserve Bank
considered the fund too big to fail.
</P>
<P>
   EARNINGS DECREASE 23 PERCENT AT LEHMAN
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Lehman Brothers Holdings jumped $1.75, to $47.875,
after the investment bank reported a 23 percent decline in
third-quarter earnings. It attributed the drop to global financial
turmoil, but said it was still operating profitably. In the first
nine months of the year, Lehman earned $662 million.
</P>
<P>
   CITICORP AND TRAVELERS WIN APPROVAL
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve approved the merger of Citicorp and
Travelers, subject to the divestiture of some key insurance
activities within five years. The Fed action removes the last
obstacle to the merger and allows for the merger to be completed
next month.
</P>
<P>
   SENATE PASSES BANKRUPTCY REFORM
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved a measure to overhaul the bankruptcy system
and make it harder for consumers to walk away from their debts. The
legislation would help banks and credit card companies recoup
billions.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA SET TO SPEND $1.2 TRILLION
</P>
<P>
   An official of the Chinese government said that country would
get through the current economic crisis by spending $1.2 trillion
on a vast program of new infrastructure projects in the next three
years. The official also reiterated pledges by China not to devalue
its currency, the yuan.
</P>
<P>
   NEW SEC RULES FOR ACCOUNTANTS
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission approved new legal
standards for accountants' conduct. The changes strengthen the
agency's power to sanction violators.
</P>
<P>
   BAYER BUYS STAKE IN MILLENNIUM
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Millennium Pharmaceuticals rose $1.4375, to $18.6875,
after the German drug and chemical company Bayer agreed to acquire
a 14 percent equity stake in the genomics company for $96.6
million. Bayer will also pay $33.4 million in licensing fees and up
to $335 million in research and development financing to Millennium
Pharmaceuticals in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   A CAMPAIGN TO `GIVE A KID A HAND'
</P>
<P>
   The Ad Council and International Advertising Association plan a
public service campaign to encourage adults to do volunteer work
with children.
</P>
<P>
   A NEW STABILITY IN BRAZIL
</P>
<P>
   The panic that throttled Brazil as a business and finance center
two weeks ago has subsided. For now, at least, Brazil's stock
market and banking system appear to have stabilized.

fabric patterns behind him - many as original as modern
architecture - Larsen has been prolific and powerful in the design
community. (Fred R. Conrad/New York Times Photo) *LITE

   (NYT2) NEW YORK -- Sept. 23, 1998 -- LARSEN-TEXTILE-DESIGN-1,
9-23 -- Jack Lenor Larsen, 71, by a pottery-glaze paper screen.
Larsen is possibly the most accomplished textile designer living,
certainly one of the most innovative and influential of the second
half of the twentieth century. ``After two years of architecture,
drafting things that would never be built, weaving felt good
indeed,'' says Larsen of his junior year at the University of
Washington in 1945. (Fred R. Conrad/New York Times Photo)

-- Today, residential water-supply pipes are made of steel, plastic
or copper. Most builders and plumbers prefer to use copper pipe
because it is easy to work with, and it resists corrosion and scale
buildup. (Edward R. Lipinski/New York Times Illustration) *LITE

 &HT;    All-out war over Clinton
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Democrats and Republicans abandoned any
pretense of cooperation Wednesday in their deliberations over
possible impeachment proceedings against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Each side accused the other of seeking to manipulate the
handling of independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report for
electoral advantage, and Republicans quickly rebuffed a request by
Democratic leaders to set a timetable for the investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader,
proposed the time limit, saying the House should finish its work,
including any punishment of the president, in the next 30 to 50
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a sizable number of Republicans who have
apparently decided that it's in their narrow political interest to
subject the country to months and quite possibly years of highly
partisan investigations related to the president,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic leader's timetable would seem to suggest that he
does not think impeachment proceedings are warranted. But his aides
said he has not reached any conclusion about the course the House
should take.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said they recently learned that Starr may have
withheld from Congress a substantial number of grand jury
transcripts, FBI notes and other documents, heightening their
suspicions that he did not provide evidence favorable to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.), a member of the Judiciary
Committee, which is reviewing the independent counsel's report,
said Starr's investigation is continuing and that he could not be
expected to turn over evidence connected with his ongoing probe.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich scoffed at the idea of setting a
deadline. ``I don't understand how people can rush to a solution
before they finish the investigation,'' Gingrich said. ``I just
think there is an awful lot we don't know yet, and there is an
awful lot of evidence that hasn't been gathered yet, and that
people need to allow the process to go forward in an orderly manner
and not assume that they know what the final outcome will be either
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans on the Judiciary Committee said Democrats have
changed their minds about the pace of the work, having made a case
initially for awaiting a new Congress in January.
</P>
<P>
   But presidential spokesman Mike McCurry said Gingrich will bear
the blame for a process that could ``drag on and on and on
endlessly'' in defiance of the public's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans want the full House to vote on a formal impeachment
inquiry before lawmakers adjourn in early October to go home to
campaign. The Judiciary Committee probably would begin its work
after the election, but before the new Congress is installed, said
Rep. John Linder (R-Ga.), after a meeting with Gingrich and other
GOP leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Both Linder and Rep. Tom DeLay (R-Texas), the House's
third-ranking Republican, indicated leaders discussed broadening
the impeachment inquiry beyond Clinton's relationship with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky and allegations that the
president tried to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   A wider investigation could include the transfer of 900 FBI
files on individuals to the White House, campaign finance tactics
and perhaps the transfer of missile technology to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you guys haven't gotten yet is that Lewinsky is a little
bit,'' DeLay said. ``Other reports establish a pattern of
conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are resigned to the prospect of a formal impeachment
inquiry, and a sizable number may vote for one to forestall
accusations that they are protecting Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A quick resolution of the matter would allow Democrats to
demonstrate their displeasure with Clinton and move beyond what for
them has become a daily torture, many in the House believe.
</P>
<P>
   In skirmishing on the House floor Wednesday, an effort by Rep.
Alcee Hastings (D-Fla.) to impeach Starr was killed by a vote of
340-71. Hastings, when a federal judge, was himself impeached in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 71 Democrats supporting Hastings' effort were
Georgians Cynthia McKinney and John Lewis. The rest of the Georgia
delegation voted against the bid to impeach Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the campaign season jockeying going on in both
parties, polling data are pointing to the potential effectiveness
of such attacks, Linder said. Honesty and integrity have displaced
education as voters' top concern in polls taken in seven or eight
congressional districts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster in Atlanta, said his surveys
are showing similar results. ``That's never happened in the 18
years I've been in this business,'' Ayres said.
</P>
<P>
   The dashing of any hope for a bipartisan effort to deal with the
president's predicament was clearly seen in the aftermath of
Gingrich's closed-door meeting with Gephardt and other leaders of
both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt, rather than appear with Gingrich, as he did two weeks
ago in a posture of cooperation, called his own news conference to
give his account of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   He urged the Judiciary Committee to refrain from releasing any
more sexually explicit material from Starr's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is scheduled to meet Friday to plan for the
release of the rest of Starr's documents, about 15 of the 18 boxes
he sent to Congress, McCollum said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the items likely to be made public next week are
transcripts of testimony from Betty Currie, Clinton's secretary;
Bruce Lindsey, longtime Clinton friend and White House lawyer; and
Vernon Jordan, a Washington lawyer and confidant of the
president's.

 &HT;    Residents eat and wait for Hurricane Georges
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH _ If the storm rolls in, how will John Alfeo
tell?
</P>
<P>
   His Hurricane Grill restaurant on 25th Street has the decor of a
full-force gale. The ceiling is hung with lanterns, stools, oars
and a Cabbage Patch doll in flight. A palm tree is frozen in
mid-bend. The shutters are askew.
</P>
<P>
   There's a storm tracking chart by the cash register, but it
shows Andrew's path.
</P>
<P>
   Georges, schmorges. ``It's not coming here!'' Alfeo says.
``What's the big deal?''
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Georges is nothing but a special on the menu. Spinach
salad with grilled chicken, bacon and balsamic vinaigrette. It sold
out on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Alfeo's only fear is the massive lines at Costco, where he goes
to restock.
</P>
<P>
   The floor of the Hurricane Grill is a swirl of green paint, and
on the walls are murals from 1947, when the place was a bar and an
artist named Phil Brinkman swapped work for free beer.
</P>
<P>
   Brinkman painted himself in one of them _ a man sitting at a
bar, holding his hat to his head as a house and boat blow by. The
mural's bartender, hair blown back, consults a barometer and rubs
his chin. A woman, smiling, fills a glass at the tap.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a hurricane-proof building,'' Alfeo says. ``I'm
willing to serve food until the end!''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. The place is in a flood zone.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane supply check on aisle three!
</P>
<P>
   Water, yes. Batteries, yes. Eight-ounce box of milk chocolate
truffles, of course. (It was the next-to-last box.)
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Burtoff doesn't know if she'll pass the storm in her
Palm Beach home or in a hotel, but at least she'll have the
truffles and a box of Pepperidge Farm Milano cookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In time of stress, always have chocolate,'' she says at the
Publix checkout.
</P>
<P>
   As of 11 a.m. Wednesday, the store's supply of Whitman's
Samplers is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Burke of Palm Beach strolls the candy aisle, picking
out two bags of tiny Snickers and one of Nestle Crunch. She adds
them to the box of Fig Newtons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have to get the ice cream, too!'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Two boxes of milk chocolate Dove Bars. ``No vegetables for me!''
</P>
<P>
   Sprite. ``I'm not a healthy person.''
</P>
<P>
   Two containers of Haagen-Dazs _ vanilla and cherry vanilla.
Done!
</P>
<P>
   She's new to hurricanes. She summers in Connecticut. ``I just
got home too soon this time,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Other hot hurricane sellers? Paula Stankunas leans across her
counter, her hands cupped to her mouth. ``BOOZE!''
</P>
<P>
   She's the manager of ABC Liquors on Dixie Highway. ``I guess
they figure if you're stuck at home, you might as well drink.''
</P>
<P>
   John Cassandra, the manager at the Boynton Beach Publix, reports
the same. He can tell how Georges is going by watching the flow of
customers after storm warning updates. ``The next big one is at 11
a.m.'' he says. ``Then 5 p.m.''
</P>
<P>
   (FYI: The ingredients for a ``hurricane'' are iffy. ``It's
basically a rum drink, rum and fruit juices,'' says Gloria Gould,
bartender at The Hawaiian restaurant in South Palm Beach. ``I would
use light rum and dark rum, and pineapple juice, orange juice and
grenadine.'')
</P>
<P>
   Tom Travaglini understands the storm. But he doesn't understand
what the storm is doing to his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Paula is expecting their baby boy, Adam, in four weeks, but her
doctor told her to get ready now. The low barometric pressure
during the storm can induce labor, some say.
</P>
<P>
   The maternity ward at St. Mary's Medical Center is preparing for
at least two dozen women. During Andrew, 28 showed up with their
own food and blankets. They'll get the extra beds, says Valerie
Christian, assistant patient care manager. ``I'll probably sleep in
my office.''
</P>
<P>
   Most doctors just want to make sure their patients are near. But
it does seem that the low pressure causes water breaks, Christian
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they were kidding me,'' Travaglini says.
</P>
<P>
   He is the assistant bakery manager at the Palm Beach Publix.
</P>
<P>
   In other news, he says, apple turnover sales are brisk.

 &HT;    West Palm Beach optometrist risked his life to help Afghan
people see
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Dr. Clifford Parker has come back to
West Palm Beach from Afghanistan with two stories to tell. One is a
thrilling adventure. The other is more important, an invaluable
lesson in culture clash that nearly cost him his life.
</P>
<P>
   Parker, 54, gave up his optometry practice here 25 years ago to
help some of the world's poorest people. He could perform what
seemed like miracles against glaucoma or cataracts or myopia, but
he could do nothing to stop the ancient distrust that finally
destroyed much of what he'd helped build.
</P>
<P>
   He is left now to think about a ruined hospital and ruined
lives, about friends taken by police. He knows the end could not
have been delayed much longer: Weeks after he and nearly every
other foreigner fled the capital of Kabul, America launched cruise
missiles at the Afghan headquarters of terrorist Osama bin Laden.
Now, Iran's army is massed along the border, threatening invasion.
</P>
<P>
   And still, Parker wonders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look back and think about whether we should have done this
or that,'' he says. ``We all made mistakes. So much of what happens
is just misunderstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   It is small comfort, but Parker knows Afghanistan and the world
have misunderstood each other for centuries. Poised at the center
of Asia, Afghanistan has endured attacks from the earliest days of
empire.
</P>
<P>
   Its languages and customs bear evidence of Doctor `knew it was
what God wanted me to do' invaders from Darius to Alexander to
Brezhnev. But although it has been often occupied, it has rarely
been conquered. It is the land that made the British army's stiff
upper lip quiver, where The Man Who Would Be King lost his head.
</P>
<P>
   More than one friend thought Parker had lost his senses when he
moved there in 1973. It was not a quick or casual decision.
</P>
<P>
   Raised a Baptist, Parker held no affiliation but kept strong
faith into adulthood. After graduating from an optometry college,
he spent two years treating evacuees from Vietnam at a Tokyo field
hospital and became intrigued by the idea of overseas charitable
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it was fear or wisdom, but I came back here
instead and opened a practice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But when an old contact brought news of an ambitious eye-care
project in Afghanistan, Parker felt certain of his course. ``I had
a sense of calling,'' he said. ``I knew it was what God wanted me
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He arrived in Kabul during a brief period of tranquility and
went to work for Christian Blind Mission International, an
organization founded by a German pastor in 1909 and now supporting
eye-care programs in more than 100 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital, large and modern, stood in contrast to nearly
everything else. ``Afghanistan was and still is medieval,'' Parker
said.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was to develop an eye-care system for a country that
had none. Patients traveled for days, often on foot: nomads,
farmers, shepherds. Parker examined them, treated them, made their
eyeglasses and acted as the hospital's chief administrator while
training local doctors and nurses.
</P>
<P>
   The International Assistance Mission, an umbrella organization,
brought help from 25 other countries. ``We had Irish nurses, Swiss
nurses,'' Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital's future was determined in Moscow. A Soviet-backed
coup in 1979 forced Parker and his colleagues to evacuate. The
Russians invaded later that year. Parker returned to work for the
friend who took over his practice and waited for another overseas
assignment. It was two years before he was dispatched to Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the States in 1991 and settled back into his West
Palm Beach townhouse and his old routine. He didn't hesitate when
the call came in July 1997 to help revive the Afghanistan project.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians were gone, but Kabul was far from tranquil. The
country was convulsed by a struggle between the Taliban militia,
drawn from Sunni Moslems of the south, and the Shiite's Northern
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Bombs had destroyed the hospital, but Parker and others
converted a house into a substitute. Parker shared a two-story
house with another hospital worker. The ground floor was surrounded
by sandbags.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the bullets fly, you go downstairs,'' Parker said. ``And
when the rockets come in, you go to the basement.''
</P>
<P>
   Attacks became daily annoyances.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be outside playing volleyball, and suddenly there'd be
an airstrike,'' Parker said. ``What you worry about is the
anti-aircraft fire. The shrapnel falling on you. So you'd run
inside. Like waiting for a rain cloud to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting supplies depended on which road was open, which faction
controlled the airport, as well as the temper of local officials.
``You might find that the way to get the medicine released is to
suggest that the man's family all come in for free checkups and
eyeglasses,'' Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   The most persuasive gesture was a job. The hospital needed about
70 workers but employed twice that. Parker had no doubt that
patients and trainees were thankful for the hospital, and he began
to feel that the goodwill was spreading.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Talibs strengthened their grip on the country, and on
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   There were new rules and dire warnings. The Talibs suspected
several forms of foreign subversion, from gunrunning to
proselytizing, and warned that all would be punished severely. Male
doctors could no longer examine female patients.
</P>
<P>
   Parker felt the Talibs didn't understand the hospital's goal and
would be less hostile if they did. Although he worked for an openly
Christian organization, Parker said there was no attempt to convert
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   But as official inquiries increased, he realized this would not
be cleared up by a friendly chat. ``To the Talibs, the year was
still 1377, and the Crusades happened the day before yesterday,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, he realized that Talib questions about politics and
corruption could have serious?Xrepercussions. What if the jobs
given to officials' relatives were seen as bribes?
</P>
<P>
   Parker began to feel fear for the first time when an Afghan
co-worker whispered, ``Some people are saying bad things about
you.''
</P>
<P>
   He began to think about all the people who didn't get jobs, or
who didn't get paid as much as they wanted. The ones he had to fire
or discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a country where thousands of people still gather for
public hangings,'' Parker said. ``I began to think about that.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also a country with no American embassy. Parker's only
guidance came from other foreign agencies' officials, sharing
thoughts in the lounge at the United Nations compound.

   One day in late July, the security police took seven of Parker's
Afghan colleagues. Then the religious police searched the offices.
A senior official ordered Parker to move his staff out of Kabul. He
decided it was time to leave the country and found that other
organizations were also packing. A rented van carried him through
the Khyber Pass to Peshawar, Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks his seven colleagues were released but can't be sure.
Some fellow missionary workers have already inquired about going
back, but Parker won't join them, at least for now. He doesn't rule
out a return some day, if the politics will ever let him
concentrate on the work he set out to do 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said he doesn't resent the Talibs for doing what they
believe is right.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, they're honorable people,'' he said. ``Desperate
people do desperate things.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll probably rest a while and then take a new assignment in
Jordan or New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a death wish,'' he said. ``I don't even have a
discomfort wish. But it's a rush to have a blind person see and
know that if you didn't do it, it wouldn't happen.''

   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Kings know that when he is
healthy, Jozef Stumpel will be their No. 1 center. The question is:
When will he be healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel twisted an ankle on Sept. 13, the first day of practice,
and hasn't played in any of the Kings' three exhibition games.
</P>
<P>
   He skated Monday and Tuesday, then received a cortisone
injection, preventing him from skating Wednesday. The Kings are
hoping he'll be able to skate today, but he is not expected to play
in Friday's exhibition game against Phoenix at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel said he is not concerned that his injury will keep him
from playing when the Kings open the regular season in Edmonton on
Oct. 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, in several more days I'll be set to go,'' he said.
``Ankles always take a little longer. I'm trying to get treatment
every day. I want to get back as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   In other injury news, defenseman Steve Duchesne bruised a hip in
Tuesday's victory over the Mighty Ducks, did not skate Wednesday
and is day to day. Rookie center Jason Morgan remains sidelined
with knee tendinitis. Defenseman Jaroslav Modry bruised his right
thigh against the Ducks and is day to day.
</P>
<P>
   __ Roster cuts: The Kings trimmed their roster to 34, sending
defensemen Sean Blanchard and Peter Hogan and center Chris Schmidt
to the Springfield Falcons of the American Hockey League, and
returning defenseman Richard Seeley and centers Matt Zultek and
Scott Barney to junior hockey.
</P>
<P>
   __ Comeback ends: Milos Holan, 27, a Czech defenseman who
struggled to regain his health after being diagnosed three years
ago with granulocytic leukemia, a form of blood cancer, was
released by the Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Holan had his immune system purposely destroyed to undergo a
bone marrow transplant in February 1996. During eight months in the
hospital he lost 50 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   __ Elsewhere in the NHL: Former Kings player Bernie Nicholls, a
veteran center known for his leadership in the locker room, has
re-signed with the San Jose Sharks....
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Devils signed goaltender Jean-Francois Damphousse
to a multiyear contract. Damphousse, 19, was the Devils' first
choice and the 24th overall pick in the 1997 Entry Draft....
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Stars defenseman Derian Hatcher was suspended for four
exhibition games and fined $1,000 for his part in an incident
during an exhibition game with St. Louis, the NHL announced.
Hatcher, who punched a Blues player from behind, was cited under
the league's attempt-to-injure rule....
</P>
<P>
   Saku Koivu agreed to a two-year contract with the Montreal
Canadiens and is believed to be in line for about $3 million a
year. &QL;

HOME RUN RACE IS A SPRINT TO THE FINISH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for rewriting throughout)  (mk) 
 By BILL DEDMAN     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ The summer of the home run headed toward a final
glorious chapter Wednesday after Sammy Sosa hit home runs No. 64
and No. 65 against the Milwaukee Brewers and once again tied Mark
McGwire in a battle that may indeed go down to the last swing.
</P>
<P>
   In a race that has captivated fans and nonfans alike, Sosa broke
out Wednesday afternoon after a five-day slump in which he had gone
without a hit, much less a home run, and had actually conceded the
race to the St. Louis Cardinal slugger.
</P>
<P>
   But each time McGwire has pulled ahead in recent weeks,
Chicago's Sosa has drawn even. The players were tied at 55 home
runs after 138 games, tied at 62, tied at 63, and now they are even
at 65.
</P>
<P>
   A screenwriter planning the Hollywood version of the home-run
race of 1998 will need a travel agent to witness the magical
ending. Fly to Houston? Sosa's Chicago Cubs will play three games
against the Astros, Friday through Sunday. Fly to St. Louis?
McGwire's Cardinals play four against the Montreal Expos, Thursday
through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   For Sosa, and his Cub teammates, Wednesday's blasts before a
crowd of 45,338 at County Stadium were ultimately overshadowed by a
loss to the Brewers that set a new level of frustration for a
franchise well known for its decades of disappointment. Leading,
7-0, the Cubs lost, 8-7, when a young outfielder, Brant Brown,
dropped a fly ball that would have been the last out of the game.
Instead, three Brewers runners scored, the game was lost and the
Cubs were suddenly a half-game behind the Mets in their
neck-and-neck National League wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it makes no difference if I finish first in home runs,
or if I finish last,'' Sosa said after the painful ending. ``I have
another thing to think about: the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second day in a row, it was a Cubs crowd cheering Sosa
on in Milwaukee. At least half of those in attendance wore Cubs
caps, shirts or entire pinstriped uniforms. Until the last play of
the game, they had a great time.
</P>
<P>
   One Cubs fan, Roger Moore, drove all night from Indianapolis to
see Sosa and his team. At age 57, he has yet to see the Cubs win a
World Series. One of their chances came in 1969, when they
collapsed and lost out to the Mets in a divisional race.
</P>
<P>
   Moore nearly died in the fifth inning, when Sosa hit No. 64 to
right field off of Rafael Roque, the left-handed Brewer pitcher,
also from the Dominican Republic. And Moore couldn't stop yelling
in the sixth, when Sosa hit No. 65 to center off of Rod Henderson,
a relief pitcher, in the sixth inning. Both were fastballs, on the
way in and out.
</P>
<P>
   But then a century of failure intruded into the late-afternoon
shadows in the ninth inning. With two outs in the bottom of the
ninth, with the bases loaded in what was now a 7-5 game, three
runners were circling the bases as a fly ball sliced toward the
line in left and Brown, the left-fielder, tracked it down.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Riggleman saw the ball. The manager of the Cubs was on the
top step of the dugout, ready to celebrate a victory that would
keep the Cubs at least even with the Mets for the last seat in the
National League playoffs. ``I don't take anything for granted,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And Brown saw the ball. He glided back and over to the line,
ready to squeeze the last out of the game. Originally a first
baseman, he had worked for six years in the minor leagues to learn
the outfield. Wednesday, he entered the game in the eighth inning,
as a defensive replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a routine fly ball,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   As Cubs fans will remember until they die, the ball bounced off
the heel of Brown's glove. It rolled away as three Brewers crossed
the plate and Brewers fan in the stadium and Mets fans in New York
exulted. ``I hope it doesn't cost us,'' Brown said, shaken and
quiet in a funereal Cubs clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Brown made no excuses for the sun or the shadows. ``I'm the one
who has to live with it, who has to take responsibility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Cubs go to Houston for their last three games against
the Astros on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The Mets, who played
Wednesday night against Montreal, will be in Atlanta against the
Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Riggleman warned his players that he wouldn't brook any moping
on the flight to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, `Hey, I love competing with you. You guys are
battling your tails off. We win as a team, we lose as a team. I
don't want to see anybody somber. You're playing in big ball games.
Let's just keep our heads up.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa was similarly consoling. ``What happened to Brownie today
can happen to anybody who plays this game. We haven't given up.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa went home with one of his two home run balls. No. 65 hit
the empty center-field area and bounced back onto the field.
Marquis Grissom, the Brewers' center-fielder, put the ball in his
back pocket. Then he threw it to first-baseman Mark Loretta, who
put it in his pocket. After a while, he threw it to the Cubs dugout
to give to Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was excruciating, Riggleman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so bad for Brant right now, because he's agonizing,''
Riggleman said. ``We're not in the position we're in right now,
competing for this wild card position, without Brant Brown. You get
that time of day, sometimes it's tough to catch a fly ball out
there. Brant's not making any excuses. He just missed the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Santo agrees. The third-baseman for the Cubs during the 1969
collapse, now a radio announcer, he left County Stadium with a sour
face and thoughts for Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about what happens to a young man,'' Santo said. ``He
has worked so hard. I just worry about how he reacts to this.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Sosa will be sorry that he can't take the
Milwaukee Brewers pitchers with him. In all, he hit 12 home runs in
10 games against the Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have to say, they're my lucky team,'' Sosa said.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, at least, the Cubs' luck was not so good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in God,'' Sosa said, ``and I believe in my
teammates. If it is for us, we're going to do it.''

AS FALL ARRIVES, AUTO DEALERS TURN OVER NEW SALES LEAF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Consumers shopping for a new car this fall are in
for a dose of sticker shock. But it won't be painful; indeed, they
should leave the dealerships smiling and maybe with some cash in
their pocket.
</P>
<P>
   They will be reaping the benefits of a rare autumn buyers'
market as automakers offer lucrative incentives on the last of the
1998 models and, on numerous lots, are slashing prices on new 1999
models just hitting showroom floors.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, even the new models come with incentives like
cash back to stimulate sales. And on many showroom floors,
comparable models of the same car will cost less this year than
last.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, the reverse is true this time of year; the new models
carry higher sticker prices with deep discounts relegated to the
current leftover models.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great time to buy a vehicle,'' said Lincoln Merrihew,
an analyst for Agoura Hills, Calif.-based J.D. Power and
Associates. ``Normally, the best time to buy a vehicle is in a
recession, but now the economy is strong and we still have
decreasing sticker prices and incentives.''
</P>
<P>
   Several factors account for this buyers' market. Automakers are
locked in a price war to snare market share while at the same time
trying to stave off the impact that floundering foreign economies
may have on sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now. there are huge incentives going,'' said Chris
Sweeney, a sales manager at Vista Ford in Woodland Hills, a Los
Angeles suburb. ``There are rebates on new cars plus incentive
financing. In the time I've been in the car business, I've never
seen rebates plus financing. You either got one or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Helping fuel the cost-cutting frenzy is the fact that
manufacturers can turn out more vehicles than there is demand for
and they have saved billions of dollars through cost reductions at
the factory and can pass some of those savings on to consumers
without slicing into profits.
</P>
<P>
   For example, some 1998 models from Ford Motor Co. come with a
$1,000 rebate and financing as low as 0.9 percent. Nissan Motor
Corp. U.S.A. is offering $2,000 cash back across the board on
models from the current model year, though the offer expires at
month's end.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Livingston, owner of Livingston Motor Car Co., a General
Motors dealership in Woodland Hills, said this kind of competitive
market tends to benefit consumers throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deals that were traditionally better toward the latter
part of the year are starting immediately. They (automakers) need
to get market share immediately and they are not waiting,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Two big foreign automakers Wednesday announced price cuts or
incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan Motor Corp. U.S.A. said that prices on its popular
Frontier and Sentra models will be about 5 percent less for the
1999 models than in 1998. Hyundai Motor America introduced what it
called the best warranty in the automotive business, a five-year,
60,000-mile limited warranty plus a 10-year, 100,000-mile
power-train warranty.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan's price cut might be an attempt to wean consumers from
the idea of incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past years, we relied pretty heavily on incentives and
this lower pricing is just a reflection of the fact we won't be
using incentives as much,'' said company spokesman Kurt von
Zumwalt. &QL;

COMMENTARY: A TRADITION OF FIREFIGHTING PUT TO THE TEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JANE GROSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUDSON, N.Y. _ The grizzled men rocking on the porch of the
Firemen's Home can pinpoint the location of a blaze from the
sequence of blasts on the air horn that summons volunteer
firefighters to work.
</P>
<P>
   They pass the time in retirement telling stories about the good
old days on the fire lines. They decorate their rooms with
commendations from the volunteer fire departments of Tarrytown,
Sayville or Slingerlands. And every once in a while, to relieve the
tedium of an old-age home, they set off the smoke detectors with
their cigarettes to summon the shiny red trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The firefighters in Hudson, the commercial hub of Columbia
County and home of the two oldest active volunteer fire companies
in the state, do not let on that they know these are false alarms.
Their dramatic arrival, with lights flashing and sirens wailing,
makes the old men happy. That is reason enough to answer the call.
</P>
<P>
   But sentimentality is becoming a luxury for the Fire Department
here. As with volunteer fire departments up and down the state and
across the nation, the number of new recruits is dwindling. Here in
Hudson, there are now about 100 volunteers, down from 160 a
half-dozen years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a total universal wherever you go,'' said Walter Eck, a
volunteer firefighter for 42 years in Slingerlands, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Neal Van Deusen, a volunteer and the fire commissioner here,
added: ``We're not in a desperate situation yet. But we've seen the
manpower diminish over the last 10 years. People don't come rushing
to the door like they used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts point to a number of factors. Less spare time in
families with two working parents. More entertainment choices, even
in small towns. The exodus of young people for careers in the city.
And the extensive training now mandated by the government _ 14
three-hour sessions to start and at least eight hours of refresher
courses every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a change in lifestyle, a change in community
makeup,'' Eck said. ``With two people working, nobody wants to give
up the time. And socially the Fire Department used to be the only
game in town. Now there's both more to do and less interest in
community activities.''
</P>
<P>
   The change seems more poignant here because of Hudson's
firefighting tradition. The J.W. Edmonds Hose Company No. 1 began
operation in 1794, and the H.W. Rogers Hose Company No. 2 followed
a few months later. The Firemen's Home, built in 1892 for needy
volunteer firemen, shares its grounds with a firefighting museum
chockablock with silver-plated parade carriages and bulbous steam
pumpers.
</P>
<P>
   The five remaining fire companies in Hudson _ the sixth closed
recently _ are housed in stately old buildings in a faded downtown
newly transformed by antique shops. The firehouses themselves are
``prized assets,'' said Tom Mabley, a retired advertising executive
who lives here. ``They appeal to our sense of history and our civic
pride.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Mabley received a recruitment flier for the Fire
Department in his utility bill. It called to mind a famous
advertisement he had designed for the Marine Corps, which needed to
find ``a few good men'' when the draft ended. ``It rang an old
bell,'' Mabley said.
</P>
<P>
   So he offered his services. He designed two advertisements
soliciting new volunteers and a poster artfully displaying the five
firehouse facades, suitable for framing.
</P>
<P>
   The 84 elderly men who live at the Firemen's Home, many in
wheelchairs or bedridden following strokes, remember the firehouse
as the center of their world, a link between generations and scene
of weekend potlucks cooked by the ladies' auxiliary.
</P>
<P>
   That camaraderie continues to this day. The old men watch
television on a wide screen donated by the fire company in West
Islip and play bingo on a machine from firefighters in Ossining.
Virtually every weekend a fire company visits or invites the men on
an outing. Last week, for instance, the volunteers in Lake George
took the able-bodied retirees on a boat ride and treated them to
chicken and biscuits for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do old volunteer firemen die unmourned. Charlie Duggan, a
resident of the home for 13{ years, was remembered at a service
this week. The U.S. flag flew at half-staff and his regular chair
in the recreation room was draped in black bunting.
</P>
<P>
   The task, then, is to inspire a new generation to join the team.
``That spirit is still alive,'' Mabley said. ``We just have to
rekindle it.''

PHOENIX BUS OFFICIALS HAVE SOLUTION TO BUS PROBLEM: DON'T RIDE
BUSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY JO PITZL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Hop off the bus, Gus!
</P>
<P>
   That's one solution Phoenix transit officials are proposing as
they anticipate standing-room-only crowds on smaller buses that hit
key routes next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how much it hurts to tell people, `You might
have to drive,' '' said Neal Manske, interim director of Phoenix
Public Transit.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities also suggest that bus riders avoid rush-hour
travel, or that they use carpools or vanpools to help alleviate the
crowded conditions expected on nine central-city routes during peak
periods beginning Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned about leaving people standing _ and not on the
bus, but at the curb,'' Manske said.
</P>
<P>
   It's already happened: A crowd of Camelback High School students
was left standing curbside recently when a jam-packed bus on Route
10 didn't have enough room.
</P>
<P>
   The new buses have 36 seats. They replace older ones that
carried 47 passengers or, in the case of double-long buses, 67
passengers. So far, Phoenix has been unable to afford to buy enough
of the new buses to make up for the lost seating capacity.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the new, smaller buses roll out on nine of the city's
most popular routes, including the Red, Blue and Green lines, which
crisscross the Valley. Most of the six other routes serve central
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers on Express Route 512 already know the
consequences of living with the smaller buses. For the past month,
they've been packed like sardines during their early-morning
commute from Fountain Hills and Scottsdale into downtown Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   After a few weeks of sitting on the floor or the steps inside
the bus, Ursula Sulista plunked down $10 for a camp stool and
brought it on board.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I'm assured of a seat,'' she said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sulista said she suffers from a bad back, so standing for the
40-minute commute to her downtown legal job wasn't an option. By
the time she boards at Scottsdale Road and Shea Boulevard, the bus
is full.
</P>
<P>
   Driving is a daunting alternative, she said. She doesn't want to
fight traffic on the Squaw Peak Freeway. Besides, Sulista said, she
feels safer on the bus _ even though her seat isn't anchored. She
hangs on to hand railings when the bus turns.
</P>
<P>
   The newest buses run on liquefied natural gas, a cleaner-burning
fuel than the diesel that powers the older city buses. The cleaner
fuel is required under a mandate by the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is not lost on bus riders such as Sulista.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these campaigns to get people to not drive their cars _
people won't do it if they have to stand on the bus,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Transit officials say there's nothing they can do to ease the
crunch on the express lines.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, the Phoenix City Council's transportation
committee tentatively earmarked $325,000 to provide extra trips on
the city's most crowded routes. The money would allow extra buses
to run during peak periods on the busiest segments of the bus
routes.
</P>
<P>
   The money would come from a new pot of state money dedicated to
transit needs. &UR; Councilwoman Peggy Bilsten said the $325,000 would
be a ``huge help'' for the overcrowded routes. However, the idea
has to be approved by the full council before any relief would be
available.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Manske and his staff are bracing for the impact
of the smaller buses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're saying, `Don't be surprised about having to stand,' ''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The crunch is the result of an unpleasant trade-off: Handicapped
accessibility vs. spaciousness. The new buses save on loading time
for wheelchairs, require less maintenance because they don't need
cumbersome wheelchair lifts and make for faster boarding times,
Manske said.
</P>
<P>
   Transit officials say that no one made buses with more than 36
seats that would meet their specifications.
</P>
<P>
   Such explanations give little solace to riders such as Donna
Boudwin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they have to bite the bullet and put some more buses
on the route,'' said Boudwin, who rides the same bus as Sulista.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Boudwin said, she may have to reluctantly start
driving to work. She said she dreads the day that a
standing-room-only bus gets hit in a traffic accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sooner or later, it will be a problem,'' she warned. ``A
serious problem.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: THE BREWERS THAT MADE SOSA FAMOUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ There was a time when the familiar slogan in this
bratwurst burg bragged about ``the beer that made Milwaukee
famous.'' But in baseball's year of the Great Home Run Race,
Milwaukee is now known for the pitching staff that made Sammy Sosa
famous.
</P>
<P>
   With his two homers here Wednesday for a total of 65, Sosa had
hit 12 against the Brewers' staff this season. More importantly, he
had tied Mark McGwire for the major league home-run lead before
McGwire faced Randy Johnson and the Houston Astros Wednesday night
in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   When Sosa was hitting four home runs in three days against the
Milwaukee Brewers nearly two weeks ago, the Cubs slugger was asked
what he thought of the Brewers' transfer to the National League
this season after nearly three decades in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   With his trademark smile, Sosa replied, ``I think it was a very
good move.''
</P>
<P>
   Very good for him, certainly.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wednesday's game, Sosa had been in an 0-for-21 slump
since he had tied McGwire with his 63rd homer, a grand-slam in San
Diego a week ago. McGwire had hit two more since then, and with
only several days left in the season, the competition that had
riveted fans throughout the summer appeared to be over.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly Sosa energized the race, slugging home runs in the
fifth and sixth innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think Mark will finish in front of me,'' Sosa said.
``I have to give up and sacrifice myself to get on base. Mark don't
have to go to the playoff. When you try to go to the playoff, you
never think about home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came back today and hit the ball; it's part of the game,''
he said. ``It's a good sign. I feel great today. I feel patient.
When I play like that, I have a better chance. Yesterday I use
three bats, today I use one _ the good one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say this is my lucky team,'' he said later, alluding
to the Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   But as a group, Sosa and the Cubs weren't feeling lucky. They
lost, 8-7, in the ninth inning when three Brewer baserunners
suddenly scored as left fielder Brant Brown dropped a fly ball that
should have been a routine final out.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to Brownie can happen to everybody,'' Sosa said.
``What happened today, just forget about it and keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's first homer, off Rafael Roque in the fifth inning,
floated into the right-field stands at County Stadium, 344 feet
away. His second, off Rod Henderson in the sixth, soared over the
center-field fence, 410 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would trade the two homers for a victory, Sosa said:
``Definitely. I care about winning. I care about the team.''
</P>
<P>
   But the loss, like Sosa's two homers, are in the book now. His
12 homers against the Brewers average one for each of the 12 games
between the teams this season _ the highest per-game homer ratio
against one team in major league history.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Gehrig, the Iron Horse first baseman of the Yankees, hit 14
homers against the Cleveland Indians' staff in 1936 for the major
league record.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Adcock of the Milwaukee Braves and Hank Sauer of the Chicago
Cubs each hit 12 against one team in one season for the National
League record _ Adock against the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1956, Sauer
against the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   But in those eras, teams played 22 games against each other team
every season. Sosa hit his 12 against the Brewers in 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's homers also gave him 155 runs batted in. It's the fourth
highest total in NL history, behind Hack Wilson's major league
record 190 for the Cubs in 1930, Chuck Klein's 170 for the 1930
Philadelphia Phillies and Wilson's 159 in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   But the number Sosa seemed more concerned with were the eventual
number of dead and injured from Hurricane Georges in the Dominican
Republic, where he grew up and where he returns each off season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard anything,'' he said. ``When we get to Houston
tonight, I will make some phone calls and try to find out. It is
bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``But maybe this,'' he said, speaking of his two homers, ``helps
them feel a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Cubs departed for Houston and Friday night's opener of
their season's concluding three-game series, Kerry Wood, their
21-year-old right-hander who struck out 20 Astros on May 6 to tie
the major league record, was almost as much a part of their
storyline as Sosa and Brown's error.
</P>
<P>
   Wood hasn't pitched since Aug. 31, when he sprained a ligament
in his right elbow. Now he may or may not return as a starter
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kerry threw the ball very well,'' said Jim Riggleman, the
Cubs' manager, after Wood fired fastballs and a few curveballs for
about 10 minutes before Wednesday's game. ``We'll see how he feels
tomorrow, but I'd say it's 50-50 at best that he'll pitch in
Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   After his brief workout, Wood said, ``I feel OK, it's up to
them.'' But even with the wild-card berth at stake, Riggleman and
Ed Lynch, the Cubs' general manager, might decide not to risk
reinjuring the golden arm that represents the future of the Cubs'
pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Tapani (19-8) will open for the Cubs against Mike Hampton
(11-7). Terry Mulholland (6-5) is scheduled for Sunday against
Shane Reynolds (19-8) unless he's needed in relief before that. The
Astros won't use Randy Johnson until next Wednesday's division
series opener.
</P>
<P>
   If Wood doesn't return Saturday, Mark Clark will start against
Jose Lima, who has surrendered two of Sosa's three homers against
the Astros this season.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter who pitches for the Cubs in Houston, their chances
will depend on Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we make it to the playoff, yes, I will be happy with this
season,'' he said. ``But if we don't, I got to go home and sing the
blues.''

LEWINSKY COPIED CLINTON'S LETTERS TO `ANDY'

   WASHINGTON _ While working at the White House, Monica Lewinsky
made copies of two letters written by President Clinton _ one to a
congressman, the other to a military official _ and sent them to a
former boyfriend as a joke, the boyfriend said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That man, Andy Bleiler, the drama teacher who disclosed in
January that he had had an extramarital affair with Ms. Lewinsky,
said through a spokesman that in both cases, the letters were
addressed to people whose first name was Andy. Ms. Lewinsky sent
them to Bleiler ``in an effort to be cute, making it seem that the
president was writing to him,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   When Bleiler made his affair with Ms. Lewinsky public eight
months ago, his lawyer said he had documents she had sent him that
showed she had more access in the White House than an ordinary
intern.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's access to the letters was apparently a function
of her job in the White House letters office. The copies sent to
Bleiler were subsequently taken from him by representatives of
Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, and Bleiler said
he did not remember precisely to whom these letters had been
addressed. But he described them as not personal in tone, although,
he said, one had some handwritten notes from the president at the
bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's spokeswoman, Judy Smith, would say only, ``When
it is appropriate, Ms. Lewinsky, her family and friends will
provide accurate information about these and other reports.''

PHOENIX BUS OFFICIALS HAVE SOLUTION TO BUS PROBLEM: DON'T RIDE
BUSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY JO PITZL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Hop off the bus, Gus!
</P>
<P>
   That's one solution Phoenix transit officials are proposing as
they anticipate standing-room-only crowds on smaller buses that hit
key routes next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how much it hurts to tell people, `You might
have to drive,' '' said Neal Manske, interim director of Phoenix
Public Transit.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities also suggest that bus riders avoid rush-hour
travel, or that they use carpools or vanpools to help alleviate the
crowded conditions expected on nine central-city routes during peak
periods beginning Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned about leaving people standing _ and not on the
bus, but at the curb,'' Manske said.
</P>
<P>
   It's already happened: A crowd of Camelback High School students
was left standing curbside recently when a jam-packed bus on Route
10 didn't have enough room.
</P>
<P>
   The new buses have 36 seats. They replace older ones that
carried 47 passengers or, in the case of double-long buses, 67
passengers. So far, Phoenix has been unable to afford to buy enough
of the new buses to make up for the lost seating capacity.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the new, smaller buses roll out on nine of the city's
most popular routes, including the Red, Blue and Green lines, which
crisscross the Valley. Most of the six other routes serve central
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers on Express Route 512 already know the
consequences of living with the smaller buses. For the past month,
they've been packed like sardines during their early-morning
commute from Fountain Hills and Scottsdale into downtown Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   After a few weeks of sitting on the floor or the steps inside
the bus, Ursula Sulista plunked down $10 for a camp stool and
brought it on board.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I'm assured of a seat,'' she said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sulista said she suffers from a bad back, so standing for the
40-minute commute to her downtown legal job wasn't an option. By
the time she boards at Scottsdale Road and Shea Boulevard, the bus
is full.
</P>
<P>
   Driving is a daunting alternative, she said. She doesn't want to
fight traffic on the Squaw Peak Freeway. Besides, Sulista said, she
feels safer on the bus _ even though her seat isn't anchored. She
hangs on to hand railings when the bus turns.
</P>
<P>
   The newest buses run on liquefied natural gas, a cleaner-burning
fuel than the diesel that powers the older city buses. The cleaner
fuel is required under a mandate by the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is not lost on bus riders such as Sulista.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these campaigns to get people to not drive their cars _
people won't do it if they have to stand on the bus,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Transit officials say there's nothing they can do to ease the
crunch on the express lines.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, the Phoenix City Council's transportation
committee tentatively earmarked $325,000 to provide extra trips on
the city's most crowded routes. The money would allow extra buses
to run during peak periods on the busiest segments of the bus
routes.
</P>
<P>
   The money would come from a new pot of state money dedicated to
transit needs. &UR; Councilwoman Peggy Bilsten said the $325,000 would
be a ``huge help'' for the overcrowded routes. However, the idea
has to be approved by the full council before any relief would be
available.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Manske and his staff are bracing for the impact
of the smaller buses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're saying, `Don't be surprised about having to stand,' ''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The crunch is the result of an unpleasant trade-off: Handicapped
accessibility vs. spaciousness. The new buses save on loading time
for wheelchairs, require less maintenance because they don't need
cumbersome wheelchair lifts and make for faster boarding times,
Manske said.
</P>
<P>
   Transit officials say that no one made buses with more than 36
seats that would meet their specifications.
</P>
<P>
   Such explanations give little solace to riders such as Donna
Boudwin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they have to bite the bullet and put some more buses
on the route,'' said Boudwin, who rides the same bus as Sulista.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Boudwin said, she may have to reluctantly start
driving to work. She said she dreads the day that a
standing-room-only bus gets hit in a traffic accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sooner or later, it will be a problem,'' she warned. ``A
serious problem.'' &QL;

 Net's Role In Scandals May Alter News Media   By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
The presidency isn't the only institution broadsided by the Starr
report. The mainstream press may be forced to reshape
news-gathering operations because of the Internet, which has
emerged as a major news source during the White House scandal.
<TEXT>
<P>
   From cyber muckraker Matt Drudge's initial reports of Monica
Lewinsky to Salon magazine's recent bombshell on Henry Hyde to the
posting of the Starr report and Clinton's grand jury testimony
online, the World Wide Web has evolved _ some might say degenerated
_ into a haven for breaking salacious news.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers and broadcasters are scrambling to keep pace with the
speed of online reports and are agonizing over whether to report
provocative content from the Web _ without compromising their
reputations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a difficult choice,'' said Leo Wolinsky, managing editor
for news at the Los Angeles Times. ``Do you write about a
controversial topic that has become an issue and give it more
credibility? Or do you ignore it and have the public think you
missed the story?''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet's role in the Starr report has elevated it from an
information service to a national news source, said Ken Bode,
moderator of PBS' ``Washington Week in Review'' and journalism dean
at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. ``Its role in this
scandal has helped create an extraordinary explosion in Internet
journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet allows Drudge or anyone to cheaply and instantly
disseminate information to an estimated 100 million people on the
Web. And once there _ whether accurate or not _ such reports put
tremendous pressure on print and electronic media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will the Net alter the mainstream press' accuracy and news
placement? I haven't noticed it yet, but there is a genuine
concern,'' said Peter McGrath, editor of new media at Newsweek.
``We've reached the point where, if a story is out, there is
pressure to follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say the traditional media already has become more
reckless.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web has prompted a premature pulling of triggers on
stories,'' said Andrew Ross, co-founder of Salon magazine in San
Francisco. The Dallas Morning News had to retract a
Lewinsky-related story it published on its Web site. Editors
``ended up with egg on their faces,'' Ross said. ``Drudge and
Newsweek changed everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Drudge, the self-styled ``Walter Winchell of the Web,'' first
gained national notoriety for posting an unpublished Newsweek
report about Clinton and Lewinsky in January _ the first public
allegation of their affair. &UR;  &LR; McGrath said the magazine held the
story because ``We felt it was so explosive, we wanted to make sure
everything was right. We just ran out of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a spotty track record on news accuracy, Drudge's
influence is undeniable offline, according to journalists.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Drudge is the ultimate trial balloon,'' said Jim Balderston,
a former Bay Guardian political reporter who now is an Internet
analyst at Zona Research in Redwood City. ``Everyone leaks
information through him, whether true or not, and it is absorbed
into the media's gestalt.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN has added some Web sites like the Drudge Report to ``its
multitude of sources, but like other sources we look at _ whether
news wire or newspapers _ we are responsible for confirming the
information independently,'' said company spokesman Kerrin Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Debate over publishing political sex scandals of dubious news
value has been heightened by the Internet, but it has been a
concern for at least a decade.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath and Ross trace the phenomenon to the Miami Herald's
coverage of Gary Hart's dalliance with Donna Rice during the 1988
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet's unfiltered coverage of the Clinton story
changes the dynamic,'' Wolinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The Times and Newsweek were among several news operations
tipped off by the original source for the story of House Judiciary
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde's adulterous affair in the 1960s, but
they declined to run it. Wolinsky said the Times was forced to
carry the story only after debate over the Salon report broke out
on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this environment, one needs to resist the temptation of
carrying out a bitter ex-husband's personal agenda in print,''
McGrath said. ``It's hard to see how it served the public good.''
</P>
<P>
   Salon's relentless coverage of the Starr investigation has
prompted critics to suggest that it is being used by the White
House, a charge it flatly refutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a double standard here: The traditional press
criticized our Hyde story, then an hour later, they slap it on Page
1 and lead their broadcasts with it,'' said Ross, a former San
Francisco Examiner editor.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the press' dilemma is the ``amazing'' quantity of
information available online, said Ann Brill, journalism professor
and research director of the Digital Missourian at the University
of Missouri in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Papers may have felt pressured to publish the Starr report in
its entirety, warts and all, because it was quickly posted online
unedited,'' Brill said. ``Plus, the media need to be more accurate
since every document _ whether text or video _ is available to the
general public over the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some in the press reported of a defiant Clinton on tape
before the grand jury testimony aired. But viewers who watched the
president came away with a much different conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newspapers like the New York Times no longer have a monopoly
on publishing government reports, like it did with the Pentagon
Papers,'' Ross said. ``Today, Daniel Ellsberg could just as easily
give those papers to Salon.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because the Net is flourishing. There were only 50 Web
sites when Clinton first entered office; today, 65,000 sites are
being created every hour.
</P>
<P>
   One of them _  &LR; www.moveon.org  &LR; _ petitions for Clinton's censure
and urges ``government to get back to work,'' said Joan Blades,
co-founder of Berkeley Systems, which developed the page. Some 500
people signed up during the site's first day of operation on
Tuesday.

 Dolby, the Man Behind the Name   By Dan Fost  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Ray Dolby's last name appears in the credits almost every time you
see a movie and is on 700 million electronics products, yet the man
himself remains relatively anonymous.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dolby Laboratories Inc., a San Francisco company that provides
the sound technology for most of the movies and video/audio
consumer electronics products that hit the market, generally avoids
the limelight. It saves that for the singers, musicians and movie
stars whose tones it delivers to the masses.
</P>
<P>
   Dolby, 65, is the chairman and sole shareholder of his privately
held company, which will open its Potrero Hill doors this weekend
to sound professionals in town for the Audio Engineering Society
convention, a trade show expected to attract 18,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   As the industry continues to push digital sound _ in movies, in
forthcoming high-definition television and in home sound over
compact discs and digital video discs _ Dolby himself offered a
shrug at the latest changes, expressing the conviction that analog
technology is here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world needs more than one solution,'' Dolby said in an
interview yesterday over lunch at the Galleria Design Center.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled that during World War II, when he was young, ``There
were all these predictions about the wonderful new world of
plastic.'' It would replace glass, steel, wood and natural fibers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wood is still important,'' Dolby said. ``So are cotton and
wool.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, older technology still figures prominently in
recording the sounds from the analog world _ essentially everything
around us. Digital technology, which is cheaper, puts analog sounds
into the computer's language of zeroes and ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some things have to be done in analog form,'' Dolby said. ``In
our processes, there are some digital boards and some analog
boards. The analog boards are the ones that talk to the outside
world. Microphones, amplifiers, human hearing _ it's all analog.''
</P>
<P>
   Digital technology started giving Dolby's dominant industry
position a run for the money several years back, according to
company President Bill Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   A company called Cinema Digital Sound, or CDS, forced Dolby to
more quickly produce a digital system for movies, Jasper said. More
serious competition has emerged in recent years from Digital
Theater Systems, or DTS, owned in large part by Steven Spielberg
and Universal Studios, and Sony Dynamic Digital Sound, or SDDS.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper said its rivals' deep pockets have led Dolby to step up
its marketing efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that pure engineering isn't going to win these
days. You've got to have marketing savvy,'' said Jasper, 50.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Dolby disputes the notion that the company received a
wake-up call, or that the competition represented a new threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always had competition nipping at my heels,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dolby, who was born in Portland, Ore., and grew up on the
Peninsula, established his company in London in 1965 when he
invented a revolutionary way to eliminate the hiss from recorded
music.
</P>
<P>
   His genius was more than merely technological, however, as he
developed a business model by which he licensed the technology at
low cost to stereo manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray is a very well-respected figure, not only in the audio
industry but in the business world,'' said Marina Bosi, president
of the Audio Engineering Society and a former employee who is now
an executive with Dolby competitor DTS. ``He's got strong
engineering skills and entrepreneurial skills.''
</P>
<P>
   The company expects to record $100 million in sales this year,
Jasper said. About $60 million comes from product sales _ Dolby
makes equipment for filmmakers and movie houses at a Brisbane
facility _ with $30 million coming from licensing and $10 million
from service to the film industry. Jasper would not disclose
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Dolby Labs employs 500 people, about half of them in a striking
brick and wood facility on Potrero Street. Another 110 work at the
Brisbane plant, 105 in England, and assorted others in Los Angeles,
New York, Tokyo and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   About 175 employees will move into a new office building Dolby
is renovating at 999 Brannan St., an intriguing glass brick
structure that once housed a Russian diamond-cutting operation.
Dolby bought the building at auction for $18.25 million earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Dolby has resisted all offers to sell his company or take it
public _ and he gets about two such offers every week, Jasper said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first offer I had to purchase my company was a year after
I started it,'' Dolby said.
</P>
<P>
   But he's never tempted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have everything I want to make me happy, which includes
enough money for myself and my family, interesting work to do, and
a sense of satisfaction from providing things that people want to
enjoy,'' he said. ``It's a perfect setup.''
</P>
<P>
   He likes to grow the company at his own pace, not at one that
Wall Street demands. ``I wouldn't like it to be any more dizzying
than it has been,'' Dolby said. ``Maybe I'm more easily satisfied
than most people. I just don't have the desire to make this the
biggest company in the world. I've always been sort of a backroom
boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Since a heart attack 14 years ago, Dolby watches his cholesterol
and keeps trim with 45 minutes on the exercise bike in his Presidio
Heights home every morning.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime sailing aficionado and member of the St. Francis
Yacht Club, Dolby decided around 1990 that he finally had the time
and money to pursue his interest in aviation. He earned his pilot's
license and takes many flights in his Pilatus PC12, based at Gnoss
Field in Novato. He has even flown to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Dolby has turned down offers to appear in advertisements. If
he's been reluctant to cash in on his name recognition, however,
others have been less reticent.
</P>
<P>
   Singer-turned-entrepreneur Thomas Dolby appropriated the name,
although Ray Dolby says litigation has led the singer to pay a
license and add his family name, Thomas Dolby Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Dolby has won virtually every award one can think of,
including an Oscar, an Emmy and a Grammy. Last year, he was among
five winners of the National Medal of Technology. He accepted the
prize with typical modesty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first part of your life is education. The second part is
hard work,'' he said. ``And then you get discovered, and people
start handing you awards.''

CITICORP'S MERGER APPROVED BY FED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday approved the merger of
Citicorp and Travelers Group Inc., a combination that would create
the world's largest financial-services company, subject to the
divestiture of some key insurance activities within five years.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed action removes the last obstacle to the merger and
allows for the deal to be completed by early next month. The
Justice Department also announced Wednesday that it had no
antitrust problems with the merger, which would create a new
company, to be called Citigroup, with assets of $751 billion and
operations in banking, brokerage and insurance businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed will also require Citigroup to divest itself of a number
of businesses within the next two years in order to comply with the
1956 Banking Holding Company Act. A bill to overturn that 1956 law,
which would allow Citigroup to be created with very few
divestitures, is now wending its way through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   If that bill is not approved, Citigroup would be faced with
having to sell the Travelers insurance-underwriting operations _
along with its real-estate management and investment operations,
the trading of physical commodities and its oil and gas exploration
business.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed, however, did agree to allow Salomon Smith Barney, the
securities arm of Travelers, to continue many of its securities
activities for two years.

 White House, Republicans Hammer Out Compromise on Visas   By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
A White House official said the Clinton administration has cut a
deal with congressional Republicans to ease passage of one of the
tech industry's top priorities _ increasing the number of foreign
workers who can be hired under H-1B visas.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Gene Sperling of our office reached agreement with Senator
Spencer Abraham this evening and informed the president,'' said
Jake Siewert with the National Economic Council.
</P>
<P>
   Until last night, the White House had threatened to veto the
H-1B bill, saying it didn't do enough to protect U.S. workers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal cut by Sperling and Abraham, R-Mich., tech firms
would get a three-year instead of five-year quota increase with
slightly lower totals of new H-1Bs. High-tech firms would have to
pay higher fees to police H-1B abuse and train U.S. workers.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise could mean that the oft-delayed measure will
actually come to a floor vote in the House of Representatives as
soon as today. If the House passes the White House-backed measure,
the Senate would also have to amend its previously passed
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the White House revealed the deal, the Institute of
Electrical and Electronic Engineers continued its opposition to the
H-1B hike, arguing that foreign temps hurt U.S. workers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the IEEE issued a Louis Harris poll showing the H-1B
increase was unpopular with voters. Yesterday IEEE president John
Reinert presented immigration data showing that the number of
permanent visas granted to skilled workers has declined, even as
foreign temps have surged.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 40,000 unused slots annually for permanent
admissions of skilled foreign professionals,'' said Reinert,
charging that high-tech firms prefer ``lower-paid, indentured''
temps.
</P>
<P>
   Although the White House agreement is a victory for the tech
lobby and a setback for the IEEE, time is short and there are many
details to be ironed out. So it's premature to celebrate _ or sob.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Misunderstood?  &LR; Poor Ziff-Davis! With its stock off two-thirds
since its IPO, the computer publishing giant feels misunderstood
and underappreciated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock price is horrifying,'' Ziff President Claude Sheer
admitted. ``We have to find some way to get Wall Street to
understand we are a very, very successful publishing company.''
</P>
<P>
   So weak are Ziff's shares _ the company, which went public at
$19, closed at $6 yesterday _ that last week its trade press
competitors were talking up a rumor that Ziff was going to sell
some of its pubs to rival IDG.
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely untrue, said Sheer, who unwittingly sparked the
rumors by summoning the crowned heads of Ziffdom to a meeting last
week where he reorganized the company's magazines into new groups
to facilitate ad sales.
</P>
<P>
   Sheer was quick to nix fears that Ziff, with 900 Bay Area
workers, was planning the sort of layoffs already undertaken by
another beleaguered trade press publisher, CMP Publications.
</P>
<P>
   Sheer said the company has reduced headcount through attrition,
and expects Ziffers to print more pages with fewer hands.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts say Ziff has gotten hammered because
computer print ad sales have stalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's necessary for Ziff to do anything dramatic
to pump up the stock,'' said Dan King with LaSalle Securities. But
if Ziff doesn't increase revenues by year end, patience could wear
thin.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley analyst Arthur Douglas said Ziff suffers another
problem. Its ZDNet online service is given practically no value by
investors, even though it has a Web franchise similar to that of
Cnet.
</P>
<P>
   While most eyes remain fixed on print ad sales, Douglas said the
Comdex trade show in November will be a key factor in Ziff's bottom
line. A strong show will help it finish the year on an up note. A
reverse could spark more rumors _ or actions.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Out-of-box experience: &LR;  About 13 percent of all new PCs fail
the first time they are booted up, according to a survey by Windows
Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If 13 percent of all new cars failed on the first turn of the
key, Detroit would be faced with a tremendous outcry,'' said
magazine executive editor Eileen McCooey.
</P>
<P>
   She relied on comments from 2,900 of the magazine's readers, who
filled out a questionnaire about their new PCs.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 percent failure rate represents the average response.
Some brands, like Hewlett-Packard, Dell and Gateway, failed the
out-of-box test less than 9 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Packard Bell and AST, were duds from 14 to 17
percent of the time. Self-built or custom-made PCs dragged down the
totals, failing 19 percent of the time.

EDITORIAL: A GLOBAL GAG RULE ON ABORTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times will say in an editorial, Thursday, Sept.
24: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are inviting President Clinton's vetoes by attaching
odious gag rules on international family-planning groups to various
bills. For his part, the embattled Clinton would probably welcome
the opportunity to remind most Americans that he stands closer to
their views on reproductive rights than do his political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Congress attached the offensive language to the State
Department authorization bill that approved payment of most of the
delinquent dues America owes to the United Nations. If some portion
of the U.N. arrears, which now exceed $1.5 billion, is not paid by
the end of the year, the United States will lose its voting rights
in the General Assembly. The failure to pay also threatens to
undermine American influence in the security council on sensitive
issues like Iraq and Kosovo. Last week, the House attached a
similar gag rule to its foreign operations appropriation bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans want to resurrect curbs on the activities of
international family planning groups that existed under the Reagan
and Bush administrations. Longstanding federal law prohibits
American government funds from being used to perform or promote
abortions in other countries. But the Reagan and Bush
administrations went further, barring such funds from going to
foreign organizations that used other money to pay for abortions or
to counsel patients on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton rightly reversed this policy. But the
Republican-controlled Congress has been trying hard to undo his
decision. Going even further, conservatives led by Rep. Christopher
Smith of New Jersey want to ban international groups from lobbying
foreign governments on abortion laws even with their own money.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have proposed allowing the president to waive the
prohibition against foreign groups that perform abortions with
money that does not come from Washington. But such a waiver would
automatically result in a cut in total American population planning
aid. A cut would perversely increase abortions, since family
planning is the most effective way to reduce abortions.
</P>
<P>
   No waiver, however, would be allowed on the anti-lobbying ban,
which is the more insidious provision since few international
organizations that seek population aid from the United States
perform abortions anyway. The rule would prohibit these groups from
sponsoring workshops on abortion issues, distributing materials or
making public statements that call attention to defects in a
country's abortion laws.
</P>
<P>
   This undemocratic rule would require nongovernmental
organizations to silence themselves in legitimate political debate
over reproductive rights in their own countries. President Clinton
should veto legislation that would punish free speech abroad.

EDITORIAL: ALBANY AS PARTY TOWN

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times will say in an editorial, Thursday, Sept.
24: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A lobbyist's life is easier in New York state than in most
places around the country. Armed with a cause and a checking
account, the lobbyist operates in an environment that seems
designed for his convenience. By day, the company or union
representative can attend legislative sessions and roam the Gothic
hallways in Albany peddling a well-honed message for a tax loophole
or a special exemption. By night, the same lobbyist dutifully
attends legislators' fund-raisers, often located within walking
distance of the Capitol building.
</P>
<P>
   Although more than 30 state legislatures ban fund-raising during
legislative sessions, New York State still allows a sleazy coziness
between the lobbyists pushing causes and the politicians begging
for money. On a busy night in Albany, there can be as many as 18
different fund-raisers where cheap wine and finger food are
exchanged for fat checks or fatter pledges. A report issued this
month by the Take Back Democracy Project, which includes a number
of public-interest groups, counted 201 fund-raising events during
the 60-day session that ended in June.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as legislative power continues to shift from the
federal government to the states, the amount of money and the
number of lobbyists in state legislatures have also soared.
Encouraged by New York's lax campaign fund-raising laws, the
dollars spent by corporate and union lobbyists in Albany soared
from $5.7 million in 1978 to $51.4 million in 1997, according to
the latest figures available from New York's lobbying commission.
</P>
<P>
   Such excess contributes to the sad state of New York's
Legislature, but only voter pressure can persuade legislators to
strengthen the lobbying laws, which are set to expire next year.
They should be asked to ban campaign contributions to members while
they are in session and to grant the state's lobbying commission
the power to investigate lobbyists' filings randomly and suspend or
revoke registrations for those who violate the law. It would also
help to change the name of that commission from the Temporary State
Commission on Lobbying to something suggesting permanence.
</P>
<P>
   An election is coming. It is a perfect time to ask local
candidates for state jobs to clean up their relationship with the
lobbyists. Most of them won't listen when they get there.

LITERARY KNIVES AT THE READY  
 PAAR AT 81 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES BARRON with ALEX KUCZYNSKI and CHARLES STRUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If one listens closely, one can hear the literary
establishment sharpening knives all over town. James Wolcott, the
Vanity Fair contributor with a reputation as a kind of blunderbuss,
has just sold his first novel.
</P>
<P>
   First, the background: The long list of well-known writers
Wolcott has skewered includes, in no particular order, James
Salter, Martin Amis, Richard Ford and Harold Brodkey. He once said
that the prolific novelist Joyce Carol Oates should never write
another word. And he once compared the feminist writer Anne Roiphe
to Susan Lucci, the soap-opera actress.
</P>
<P>
   As for Wolcott's book, one review is already in. The novelist
Thomas McGuane, who wrote in Esquire several years ago that he had
heard that Wolcott was working on a book, panned it without so much
as waiting to read the manuscript: ``If it is ever published, it
will be no good.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolcott, though, does not fear potential critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Harold Brodkey may reincarnate himself to review the
book,'' he said Wednesday after his book had been purchased by
HarperCollins for a sum he said was in ``the mid-six figures.''
(Brodkey died in 1996.)
</P>
<P>
   The plot of Wolcott's as-yet-untitled novel, which he has been
working on for seven years, revolves around a 40-ish Manhattan
bachelor. ``It's about a man who hits a crisis and he has to pull
himself together,'' Wolcott said. ``He tries desperately to become
husband material, because he's such a terrible failed bachelor.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolcott is himself a 40-ish Manhattanite who pulled it together
and married in 1994. But no matter how autobiographical it may be,
the book does not tell everything he knows; he said that some of
his bachelor experiences were too unbelievable to include, even
though the book will be published as fiction, not nonfiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember looking into a woman's refrigerator for the first
time,'' he said, ``and all she had inside were tiny Japanese toy
robots. I thought, even then, `Now, who would believe this if I put
it in a novel? Nobody!'''
</P>
<P>
   His editor at HarperCollins, David Hirshey, said the usual
things that editors say about authors they have just invested in:
``He's one of the most lively and distinct voices in America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And lucky for him,'' Hirshey added, ``James Wolcott is not out
there to review it.''
</P>
<P>
   Paar on Cassette
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to wait up,'' Miriam Paar was saying. ``Jack would come
home and have a drink and want his dinner, and he'd ask me to go
over what worked and what didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Paar was, and is, her husband. In the 1950s, before
talk-show hosts taped their programs in the afternoon, he did the
``Tonight Show'' live, from 11:15 p.m. to 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Paar, who was often a presence in her husband's monologues,
was also a presence at the talk-show host's equivalent of a book
party: a gathering Tuesday night at the Friars Club on East 55th
Street, celebrating the release of a three-cassette set of excerpts
from his days on the air called ``Jack Paar: As I Was Saying . . .
And More!''
</P>
<P>
   Paar, now 81, talked about taking over ``Tonight'' in 1957.
``They usually give 13-week contracts,'' he said. ``I found out
later we only had 11 weeks, till the end of the year. They had some
other show ready to go _ what it was I have no idea.'' Instead, he
said, ``We turned out to be a smasheroo.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the long parade of guests on the show? One who stands
out in Paar's memory was Oscar Levant, a talented but erratic
pianist who had been a protege of George and Ira Gershwin. ``We
wanted him to come on and play `Rhapsody in Blue,''' Paar said.
``It was World Series time. We promised him tickets and
seven-thousand five. He came on, sat down at the piano and played''
_ here Paar sang an easily recognizable seven-note phrase from
``Rhapsody in Blue'' _ ``and walked off.''

EDITORIAL: CLINTON CROSSCURRENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times will say in an editorial Thursday, Sept. 24: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The chaotic events in Washington have finally resolved
themselves into two main debates _ one having to do with President
Clinton's political future and the other with Kenneth Starr's legal
competence and fairness.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is under heavy attack, much of it fueled by flaws and
omissions in the report that he sent to the House of
Representatives. As weaknesses in the report became apparent on
close analysis, the White House clearly hoped to divert attention
from President Clinton's lies by casting Starr as a witch-hunting
ideologue and a sexual McCarthyite. Starr, following
well-established habits, made himself an easy target.
</P>
<P>
   The central argument of the report _ which lays out the case
that Clinton made false statements under oath _ is convincing, but
the report would have gained greater authority if it had been
written with more restraint. Starr also presents troubling
circumstantial evidence or testimony that Clinton coached Betty
Currie about her testimony, made a deal for mutual false testimony
with Monica Lewinsky, and enlisted Vernon Jordan to find her a job
as part of an effort to keep her from going public with her rage
over being jilted. But the Starr report should have conceded that
due to denials and conflicts or ambiguities in testimony, he had no
smoking gun on these points, and he should have included Ms.
Lewinsky's exculpatory statement that she had not been counseled to
lie or bribed with the promise of employment by Clinton or Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Legal klutziness, however, does not add up to prosecutorial
misconduct. The impeachment process is not governed by the rules of
criminal law. Those who argue that Starr should never have inquired
into Clinton's truthfulness about his sex life fail to consider his
legal mandate. As an officer of the court, operating under Justice
Department aegis and the supervision of three federal judges, he
would have been derelict if he had walked away from evidence of
potential perjury. Had he bottled up that evidence, he would have
ignored the federal statute requiring him to inform the House of
``any substantial and credible information ... that may constitute
grounds for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   In the main, Starr did his legal duty. He reported every six
months, as required, to the federal judges supervising him.
Attorney General Janet Reno could have recommended his dismissal to
her boss, Clinton, at any time. No such action was justified
because Starr, based on the available evidence, has not exceeded
his legal authority as a federal prosecutor. He would, on the other
hand, have been guilty of a grave offense if he had failed to
investigate false swearing by a president or if, once the
likelihood of such conduct was established, he had hidden that
information from Congress and the public.
</P>
<P>
   That brings us to the second debate in Washington. The winds
around Clinton have abated a bit. The tolerant public response to
his grand jury testimony raises doubts about the Republican plans
to string out the impeachment process at least through the November
election. For the first time, the White House openly and
aggressively shopped for a deal with Congress Wednesday, with a
spokesman saying the president understood that pain and punishment
had to be part of his process of expiation. But Clinton reportedly
still believes that he can secure a deal without confessing to his
sworn lies, and the Republicans cannot and should not accept that.
After all, Clinton's strongest allies and his own staff use words
like ``indefensible'' and ``reprehensible'' to describe his
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   That language bespeaks the fact that no one in his own party,
his own White House or his political base in the country believes
Clinton told the truth in his sworn answers about his contacts with
Ms. Lewinsky. Significant numbers in these groups agree with former
President Bush's statement Wednesday that Clinton has diminished
the house and the office that Bush and the other presidents since
Richard Nixon treated with personal respect and careful
stewardship.
</P>
<P>
   The hunger of the White House and the congressional Democrats
for a deal accounts for the speed with which they rallied to Sen.
John Kerry's suggestion of a showdown hearing for Clinton before
the House Judiciary Committee. But no Democrat, whether the
president or his messenger, will be able to entice the Republicans
into an early deal without an unambiguous confession.
</P>
<P>
   Given the self-destructiveness of his tactics throughout 1998,
it is impossible to guess how Clinton analyzes his situation. He
may confuse public weariness and willingness to forgive with
respect. He may even believe that the 20 additional boxes of
evidence the House Democratic leader, Dick Gephardt, asked for
Wednesday will harm Starr more than himself. But whatever Starr's
failings, they will never achieve the grand malignancy of Clinton's
folly and miscalculations. As his White House belatedly sues for
peace, those mistakes have already toppled virtually everything
except his chance to linger in office until 2001. &QL;

BRUINS' NEXT FOE: GEORGES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ To beat the Hurricanes, UCLA must first avoid the
hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were scheduled to depart for Miami this morning as
Hurricane Georges continued its move across the Carribean towards
Southern Florida. Whether UCLA lands in Miami or an alternate
destination _ and whether Saturday's game is played as scheduled _
depends on the storm's course.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 80,000 residents in the Florida Keys have been
evacuated, but there's a chance Georges will miss the mainland and
move west into the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists believe the storm will pass before Saturday's
noon kickoff. But severe damage to the city of Miami and/or
surrounding areas would prevent available security and medical
personnel from working the game. One possibility is playing Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be Sunday or we're going home,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo
said. ``That's the latest we can play.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's no kickoff this weekend, the earliest open date for
both teams is Dec. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo cringed at that scenario, and while a two-month delay
seems dramatic, there's no denying Georges' force. It killed dozens
and left half of Puerto Rico without water and power earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
   The last major hurricane to hit Miami was Andrew in 1992, which
caused $30 billion damage as the worst natural disaster in U.S.
history.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's charter was scheduled to depart LAX at 11 a.m. and land
at 7:30 p.m. If the storm attacks tonight, the Bruins probably will
divert to Atlanta, spend the night there, then fly to Miami on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is flying into Orlando and driving to Miami.
Worst case scenario: UCLA spends two nights in Atlanta/Orlando and
arrives in Miami on Saturday morning, hours before kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the hurricane's disposal,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Been there, endured that: Toledo had a first-hand hurricane
experience (Eugene) while vacationing in Mexico in the mid-80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 135-mph winds, and it looked like a war zone. It
was very scary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So scary, Toledo's wife, Elaine, wants nothing to do with
Georges. This will be the first game she's missed since Toledo
became coach in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   __ McNown exposed: UCLA quarterback and Heisman Trophy candidate
Cade McNown has a rare chance to impress East Coast Heisman voters.
The game will be televised nationally by CBS, with ex-Bruin coach
Terry Donahue doing the commentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``One complaint is we don't get a lot of East Coast exposure and
this is an opportunity to take advantage of that,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Josh's Webb: Converted defensive lineman Josh Webb has played
well in his three weeks at offensive tackle. With Jim Ghezzi
starting at guard until Oscar Cabrera (sprained ankle) returns,
Webb is UCLA's top reserve tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not quite solid with the offense, but he's got some
talent,'' Toledo said. ``(Eventually) he'll definitely be
challenging for a starting spot.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Movie of the week: All-American offensive tackle Kris Farris
is a film buff who wants to make movies after his playing career.
He has agreed to review a movie per week for the Daily News. This
week's selection: !arrow!Rounders.!off!
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt Damon's newest film provides the audience with an
educating insight into the complex mind of a professional poker
player. While the film runs about 15 minutes too long and is very
predictable, it is surprisingly captivating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The characters are well-developed and Damon and Edward Norton
(Damon's sleazy friend) deliver a strong on-screen chemistry seldom
seen in Hollywood today. The poker-game sequences are very
educational and intense, allowing the audience to feel as if it
were just dealt a winning hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rounders will have you on the edge of your seat for the final
showdown between Norton and the seemingly unbeatable Teddy KGB
(John Malkovich, with a Russian accent).''
</P>
<P>
   RATING: three pancakes (out of four).

FAILING TO CAPITALIZE ON CUBS' COLLAPSE, METS LOSE TO EXPOS, 3-0 
</HEADLINE>
  (cb) 
 By JASON DIAMOS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Out of nowhere, the New York Mets were handed a
gift-wrapped opportunity on Wednesday. And then the Mets turned
around and handed it right back.
</P>
<P>
   When Chicago's Brant Brown dropped a game-ending fly ball in
left for a three-run error in Milwaukee to give the Brewers an 8-7
victory over the Cubs in a game they trailed by 7 runs, how could
the Mets not think destiny was on their side? There was only one
little problem: The Mets still had to go out and beat the Montreal
Expos at Shea Stadium on Wednesday night. And beating Montreal is
something the Mets have seldom been able to do this season.
</P>
<P>
   As Brian McRae had cautioned before the game after watching the
Cubs' collapse, ``It doesn't mean anything if we don't win
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Mets did not. Instead, they were shut out, 3-0, by the
lowly Expos. As a result, the Mets and Cubs are still tied for the
National League wild card lead with three games to go, with the
resurgent San Francisco Giants lurking right behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the same position as we were about three weeks ago _
tied,'' Mike Piazza had said Wednesday afternoon. ``I wouldn't be
surprised if it did come down to a one-game playoff, after all.''
</P>
<P>
   Or two one-game playoffs, if the Giants somehow sneak back in.
And should the Mets (88-71) not advance to the post-season for the
first time in a decade, they will have no one to blame but
themselves. That is because they dropped 8 of 12 games to Montreal
this season, including 4 of 5 in the final three weeks. And in the
last five days against two of the worst teams in the league _ the
Expos and the Florida Marlins before them _ the Mets went just 2-3.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Expos are 30 games under .500 this season, the
Mets never figured out how to beat them. For the second time in 12
days, Carl Pavano out-dueled Bobby Jones. Pavano even drove in a
run with a second-inning double.
</P>
<P>
   And then the Mets could not score with the bases loaded and
nobody out in the bottom of the seventh, or after Montreal almost
tried to give them a chance in the eighth with a one-out error and
a two-out wild pitch that enabled Piazza to reach first when he had
struck out.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Expos scored an insurance run in the top of the
ninth off Turk Wendell, who was pitching in his franchise-record
ninth straight game. And now the Mets head to Atlanta _ where a
couple of pitchers named Glavine and Maddux await them the final
two days of the season _ knowing they had allowed a golden chance
to slip away.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a one-game playoff with the Cubs on Monday, Jones
will most likely get the call. But before Wednesday night, his
right forearm, hit by a hard grounder in Montreal two starts
before, was still stiff and there was some question whether he
could make the start. Pitching on the side recently, he felt a
tingle in his fingers. Valentine was told it was from swelling in
the forearm, but Jones arrived at Shea Stadium on Wednesday and
told him he was fine.
</P>
<P>
   Jones pitched well except for one costly inning, the second. He
allowed just five hits in seven innings, and all but one of them
came in the second.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos scored twice in the inning, on a home run by the
rookie catcher Bob Henley and back-to-back two-out doubles by two
more rookies, Orlando Cabrera and Pavano. Once again the bottom of
the Montreal order had wreaked havoc on the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Henley was a bother in Montreal two weekends ago when the Expos
took two of three from the Mets. And Cabrera delivered the
game-winning hit at Shea on Tuesday night, off reliever Dennis
Cook's back.
</P>
<P>
   Pavano, the primary player Montreal obtained from Boston for
Pedro Martinez, outpitched Jones in Montreal on Sept. 11 in a 5-1
Expos victory. On Wednesday night, Pavano not only drove in a run
for himself by hammering a double through the gap in left-center,
he also limited the Mets to two singles and no runs over the first
six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as he had in Montreal, Pavano tired in the seventh. But
even though the Mets loaded the bases with nobody out, they still
could not score.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza started the rally by grounding his second single off
Pavano. And when Brian McRae followed by working a full-count walk,
Pavano was done for the evening. On came the left-hander Tim Young,
who walked the pinch-hitter Jay Payton on four pitches to load the
bases.
</P>
<P>
   After Young threw a fifth straight ball, to the pinch-hitter
Butch Huskey, on came the former Met Mike Maddux, who is seldom
confused with his brother Greg. But Maddux retired three straight
pinch-hitters: Matt Franco on a pop-up to center, Todd Hundley on a
strikeout swinging, and Luis Lopez on a strikeout looking.  &QL;

VICTOR COOPERSMITH, 51, FASHION ENTREPRENEUR

<TEXT>
<P>
   Victor Coopersmith, a fashion entrepreneur who in July closed
the company that made women's wool suits and other clothes designed
by his wife, Andrea Jovine, drowned Sept. 9 while swimming in Lake
Powell near Page, Ariz., the U.S. Park Service said. He was 51.
</P>
<P>
   Coopersmith was last seen by family members and friends about
3:30 p.m. near a marina as he swam from a ski boat that was on a
towline behind a houseboat, said Char Obergh, a spokeswoman for the
Park Service. She said divers recovered the body in 200 feet of
water on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Coopersmith was a combative businessman who in 15 years built
sales of Coopersmith Enterprises to a reported $75 million a year
but struggled in the last year to keep the company going before
closing it.
</P>
<P>
   The Andrea Jovine line of women's suits and other clothing was
known as bridge wear, expensive clothing that is marketed one notch
below designer labels. At its peak, Jovine's bridge business had
sales of about $70 million, according to an estimate by Women's
Wear Daily, the trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, he vowed to sue three department stores over what he
considered excessive returns of unsold merchandise and unauthorized
deductions from invoices.
</P>
<P>
   Coopersmith started his career at 19 as a dress salesman for
Leslie Fay Cos. and was named president of the women's division of
Damon six years later. In 1979, he was a founder of the Adrienne
Vittadini clothing company, selling out in 1982 to go into business
with Ms. Jovine the next year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, Alexander
of Greenwich, Conn., and Jordan of Westbrook, Conn.; a daughter,
Lisa Coopersmith Schwartz of New York; his parents, Norman and
Beverly Coopersmith of Tamarac, Fla., and a brother, Richard of
Newtown, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier marriage, to Carla Kramer, ended in divorce.

JAMES FLETCHER, 63, BANKER IN POOR CHICAGO AREAS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Wis., Calif.)  (lb) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Fletcher, a chairman of the South Shore Bank, a pioneering
lender to some of the poorer neighborhoods in Chicago, died of
complications of lymphoma on Sept. 16 at St. Joseph's Hospital in
Chicago. He was 63 and a lifelong resident of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher was one of a group of idealistic young bankers in the
early 1970s who transformed a struggling commercial bank into a
model of how a for-profit company could help revitalize
deteriorating communities.
</P>
<P>
   South Shore has been one of few banks to operate in low-income
neighborhoods and make money investing in the community. Many
locally owned banks in low-income neighborhoods are criticized
because they are run very conservatively, making few loans with the
deposits they gather. Others, notably Freedom National Bank in
Harlem, in New York, have failed because of lending policies that
were too aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher ``felt very strongly that we had a dual objective, to
make a profit and to do development work,'' said Milton Davis, the
vice chairman of Shorebank Corp., South Shore's holding company,
and one of the bankers who took over the company in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was an application for a loan that might not be
profitable but would contribute enormously to the development of an
area, he would always take the side of development,'' Davis said.
``But he was successful in finding a way to put a credit on the
books of the bank structured in a way that we were sure to be
repaid.''
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher was born on Jan. 21, 1935, in Chicago. After graduating
from Northern Illinois University in 1958, he served three years in
the Marine Corps and then taught in the Chicago public schools for
three years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, he joined the Chicago Committee on Urban Opportunity as
an urban planner for the city's anti-poverty program. He held
several other government jobs before joining Hyde Park Bank and
Trust, near the University of Chicago, in 1969 to work in its urban
redevelopment lending division.
</P>
<P>
   The South Shore Bank, then a traditional commercial bank, was
struggling to survive as its neighborhood population changed from
white to black. It wanted to move into the Standard Oil Building in
downtown Chicago, but its application was rejected by the federal
government after protests by the community.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, several executives from Hyde Park Bank, including
Ronald Grzywinski, its president, raised $4 million from
foundations, church groups and wealthy individuals to buy South
Shore and devote it to community development.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher left Hyde Park for South Shore in 1978. At first, he
ran a fund that made equity investments in small businesses and a
nonprofit institute, linked to the bank, that operated some of the
development projects.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983 he was named president of South Shore Bank, and in 1996
he became chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The success of South Shore drew the attention of Bill Clinton,
when he was governor of Arkansas. Clinton encouraged the
establishment of a similar bank in Little Rock, and in his 1992
presidential campaign he promised to encourage other community
development banks modeled on South Shore.
</P>
<P>
   But South Shore's practices have at times been criticized.
</P>
<P>
   Several community groups and black churches protested South
Shore's acquisition of Indecorp, the largest black-owned bank in
Chicago, in 1995. They complained that South Shore was mainly owned
by white people and big companies, including the largest commercial
banks in Chicago. Grzywinski, the chairman, and many of the
managers are white. Davis is black, as was Fletcher.
</P>
<P>
   Since the acquisition, however, South Shore has increased the
loans that are made at the Indecorp branches from 30 percent of
deposits to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher is survived by his wife, the former Norma Gant; his
mother, Mildred Fletcher Holtz of Milwaukee; three daughters,
Cheryl Mulholland of Costa Mesa, Calif., and Maria Barksdale and
Kathleen Lisciotto, both of Chicago; a son, James of Chicago, and
two sisters, Kathleen Hall of Racine, Wis., and Sharon Schultz of
Milwaukee.

WILLIAM BALLARD, 92, SCHOLAR WITH WIDE INTERESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Vt., Mass., N.H., Md., Calif.)  (lb) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Whitney Ballard, professor emeritus of biology at
Dartmouth College, died on Sept. 14 at his home in Norwich, Vt., in
the same bed in which he was born 92 years earlier in
Griswoldville, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   In between, Ballard seemed to do a little bit of everything,
researching and publishing books and articles on embryology as he
fought for conservation causes, bred orchids and served as local
tree warden and moderator of the fire district.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 at a Dartmouth Alumni Ceremony at Lincoln Center, Dr. C.
Everett Koop, the former surgeon general, called him one of the
teachers who had most influenced his professional life.
</P>
<P>
   Ballard was a ``true scholar and Renaissance man,'' Koop said
this week, recalling a time at Dartmouth when the professor
presented a crocodile, wearing a tie, to be dissected.
</P>
<P>
   Ballard's research _ particularly in studying ancient fish, the
bowfin and the gar _ was supported by the National Science
Foundation and the National Academy of Science. He called these
studies his ``Odyssey of Strange Fish,'' and they were a passion
that took him to field sites and laboratories all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   But he remained deeply involved in his local community. In World
War II he watched for enemy planes and then went to people's barns
at milking time because he knew he would find farmers there to tell
them about what to do if a bomb fell. He was an architect of the
first interstate school district in the United States, combining
Norwich and Hanover, N.H., in 1963 in the Dresden School District,
which still exists.
</P>
<P>
   A strong supporter of conservation causes, Ballard intensively
studied a local gorge called the Norwich Grand Canyon and blazed a
series of trails through wooded areas that became known
collectively as the Bill Ballard Trail. He recently donated 42
acres to the Town of Norwich to be preserved as a natural area.
</P>
<P>
   Ballard was born April 4, 1906, and spent his childhood in
Greenfield, Mass. He graduated from Dartmouth in 1928 and received
his doctorate from Yale in 1933. In 1938, he married Elizabeth
Flanders, who was the daughter of Sen. Ralph Flanders of Vermont.
She died in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by four children: Nancy-Jean Seigal of Bethesda,
Md., David Ballard of Sonoma, Calif., Helen Sagan of Wellesley,
Mass., and William Ballard of Putney, Vt.; a sister, Margaret
McMahan of Tracy, Calif; six grandchildren and four
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ballard is remembered for his enthusiasms, including his nature
walks known as ``salamander meanders'' at the Montshire Museum in
Norwich, which he helped found.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his efforts to discover how to propagate a rare
orchid from seeds, he earned the nickname Ladyslipper Man,
receiving awards from the National Orchid Society and the New
England Wildflower Society.
</P>
<P>
   He played minor roles in Gilbert and Sullivan operettas and
delighted in inviting friends over for evenings of music-making, at
which guests sang old hymns or listened to chamber music.
</P>
<P>
   At Thanksgiving, Ballard invited students unable to go home to
eat at his home.
</P>
<P>
   John Copenhaver, who studied as an undergraduate with Ballard
and was later his faculty colleague for more than 30 years, said in
an interview that Ballard was not without faults. ``He was always
very proud of his homemade beer, which was lousy,'' Copenhaver
said. He added that his wife always brought a six-pack when they
visited the Ballard home.
</P>
<P>
   Ballard collected his last fish egg at age 91 in Lake Champlain,
and was said to be bitterly disappointed that failing health
prevented him from joining a Japanese colleague on a piscatorial
expedition to Lake Michigan last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Acquaintances recalled that in a book he published in 1961,
``Comparative Anatomy and Embryology,'' he quoted an old hymn on
the last page: ``Strange that a harp of a thousand strings should
stay in tune so long.''

   NEW YORK _ Few of the United States' rabbis will be able to
resist the allusive New Year's gift President Clinton offered to
them this month. Every fall, as they stand before overflowing
congregations on Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, most pulpit rabbis
struggle to devise a new variation on the theme of repentance, the
nature of sin, the snare of old habits.
</P>
<P>
   The perils of annual repetition are well known to worshippers,
but this year, rabbis can simply clip their object lesson from the
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't very well be coy and pretend that it's not going
on,'' said Rabbi Chaim Stern, who has no need to pretend. Earlier
this month, the president read to a group of clergy an extensive
passage from ``Gates of Repentance,'' the High Holy Days prayer
book edited by Stern, as a description of the path to contrition he
planned to take since acknowledging his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Stern, the liturgist of Reform Judaism, known for his
translations of Hebrew poetry and prayer, was being buttonholed by
congregants and reporters on his political opinions, and feeling
obligated to come up with something profound.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president hadn't pushed me into this, I might have
resisted talking about it, because I'm countersuggestible,'' said
Stern, who is the senior rabbi at Temple Beth El of Northern
Westchester, in Chappaqua. ``But given that he has insisted I speak
on the subject, by virtue of what he has done, I suppose I won't
resist, and I probably would have spoken about it anyway. It's
hardly an outlandish idea that one should speak on the ideas of
turning, of compassion and forgiveness, and what its meaning is for
us. You can't avoid it.''
</P>
<P>
   The passage the president read was written in the 1960s by Rabbi
Jack Riemer of Florida and was chosen for inclusion in the High
Holy Days prayer book of the Reform movement by Stern in 1979.
Entitled ``On Turning,'' it compares the natural change of seasons
with the far more difficult act of will needed to change human
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means admitting that we have been wrong; and this is never
easy,'' the passage says, in words read by Clinton to a White House
prayer breakfast on Sept. 11. ``It means losing face; it means
starting all over again; and this is always painful. It means
saying: I am sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   The passage was included in a section of meditations and
additional readings because Stern liked its seasonal allegory and
stark description of the act of repentance, though it is not part
of the traditional Yom Kippur liturgy and is rarely read aloud even
at Reform services.
</P>
<P>
   But with more than 750,000 copies of the prayer book in print,
in almost all of the nation's 800 Reform congregations, the passage
is expected to receive unusual attention at services Tuesday and
Wednesday on Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, the holiest day in
the Jewish calendar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very rich concept,'' Stern said. ``The Hebrew word for
repentance is better translated as return, returning to one's best
self, turning back to God. It's a better translation than
repentance, which has had a pretty bad press since Elmer Gantry.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Stern's experience choosing translations has made him one of the
most widely published Jewish liturgists in the world. He is also
the editor of ``Gates of Prayer,'' the Reform movement's Sabbath
and Festival prayer book, and ``Gates of the House,'' the
movement's book of home prayers, as well as a popular Haggadah, the
text read at Passover seders, and several other volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Though many traditional Jews have bridled at the books'
carefully gender-neutral language _ all references to God as King
are changed to Sovereign, for example _ and at the excisions of
large parts of the Conservative and Orthodox liturgy, the books
have become the principal point of contact with religious ritual
for many American Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``As editor of our major prayer books, he has helped the Reform
movement to reach thousands and thousands of Jews, creating a
vehicle for people to relate to God,'' said Rabbi Paul Menitoff,
executive vice president of the Central Conference of American
Rabbis, the movement's rabbinical organization. ``He has a unique
talent to be able to select and write prayers that resonate with
other people, and that also resonate with Jewish tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern, 68, grew up in Brownsville, Brooklyn, the child of
Orthodox Jews who was schooled at yeshivas from an early age. But
the rise of the Nazis and the Holocaust caused him to question his
faith, and he became far more secular than his family, attending
City College and Harvard Law School.
</P>
<P>
   He became attracted to the Reform movement's liberal
interpretations of Jewish tradition in the 1950s, and after being
ordained helped write a new prayer book for the Liberal movement in
England, similar to the Reform movement. He was later asked to do
the same in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After a divorce and the death of his second wife, he recently
remarried and now lives in Pleasantville, not far from his suburban
synagogue. If his congregants want to know his opinion of the
president's repentance, he says, they'd better be in their seats on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to hear what I have to say, you'll have to come on
Kol Nidre,'' he said, as if anyone needed encouragement to attend
the most crowded service of the year, the one that begins the Day
of Atonement. ``Maybe I'll talk about it.''

BAYER TO PAY $96.6 MILLION FOR STAKE IN MILLENNIUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (cb) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bayer A.G., the German drug and chemical company, said on
Wednesday that it would pay $96.6 million to buy a 14 percent
equity stake in Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc., a genomics company
in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Bayer will also pay $33.4 million in licensing fees, and up to
$335 million in research and development financing in the next five
years. The ultimate amount of the financing is dependent upon
Millennium's identification of 225 targets for new drugs for
cardiovascular disease, cancer, osteoporosis, pain, liver fibrosis,
hematology and viral infections.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the deal was one of the richest ever between a
large pharmaceuticals concern and a biotechnology company, and a
validation of Millennium's science and strategy. Although
Millennium has had a lower profile than competitors like Human
Genome Sciences Inc. or Incyte Pharmaceuticals Inc., it currently
has more than $1 billion in potential pharmaceutical partnership
financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Millennium it is a critical deal, both in terms of
alleviating their short-term cash flow problems, and allowing them
to increase productivity across the board for their in-house
research and development,'' said Akhtar Samad, an analyst with
Mehta Partners. Noting that Millennium had previously entered
partnerships with Roche Holding A.G. and Monsanto, he added, ``the
potential downstream concern is that their different corporate
partners may wind up being direct competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Millennium shares rose $1.4375 on Wednesday, to $18.6875, in
Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   The deal gave Bayer access to the leading edge of drug discovery
technology. Genomics, the effort to spell out all of the body's
genes and seek correlations between genetic mutations and disease,
remains a controversial subject in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is now possible to employ genomic research for the
development of drugs on an industrial scale,'' Dr. Wolfgang
Hartwig, Bayer's head of pharmaceuticals research, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bayer is saying that they believe Millennium can act as a
front end, as the discovery organization that can substitute for an
internal program,'' said Michael King, an analyst with BancBoston
Robertson Stephens Inc. ``Millennium appears to be very good at
coming up with a lot of targets in a rapid fashion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Millennium, Bayer's financing ``will give us some really
strong discovery and development capability,'' Mark Levin,
Millennium's president and chief executive, said in a telephone
interview. ``Out of the 225 targets, Millennium will actually get
90 percent of them back,'' after Bayer's review, he said. ``On top
of that, we retain all biotherapeutic and agricultural rights,'' he
said. Biotherapeutics includes proteins and antibodies, but not
traditional small molecule drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Levin said the deal means Millennium will be profitable this
year. Analysts had expected the company to lose 21 cents a share
for 1998, according to First Call.

PLAN TO LEASE TRADE CENTER IS NEAR A VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is
expected to vote Thursday to put the World Trade Center _ its
flagship property and the largest office complex in the country _
on the market, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki of New York said in an interview that after
speaking to Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey, he was ``very
confident'' the agency's commissioners would move ahead with the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   If the proposal is adopted, the Port Authority will seek bids
from private developers for a 99-year lease on the vast complex,
whose twin towers and other buildings contain 10.5 million square
feet of office space and 300,000 square feet of retail. The bistate
agency would technically remain the owner _ a legal status
officials say could simplify the financial aspects of the
transaction _ but such a lease would effectively put the Trade
Center in private hands.
</P>
<P>
   Port Authority officials say the complex could fetch more than
$1.5 billion, with as much as $300 million of that paid at the
beginning of the lease. Real estate executives say a handful of big
developers _ possibly including the Tishman Speyer group or Donald
Trump, if he had a partner to help with the financing _ might be in
a position to bid on the property.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioners are scheduled to hold a closed-door session on
the Trade Center Thursday afternoon and are likely to vote at their
regular monthly meeting after the session.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal comes at a high point for both the downtown real
estate market and the Trade Center itself, which is now 94 percent
occupied after having been partly emptied by the 1993 terrorist
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The authority has considered getting rid of the Trade Center for
years, and it fits in with both governors' philosophy of getting
the Port Authority out of the real estate business and forcing it
to focus on its mission as a transportation agency. But the
authority has been hesitant to move too quickly, its chairman,
Lewis Eisenberg, said Wednesday. Now, having digested several
recent studies, Eisenberg said, the commissioners are ready to act.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said a lease deal would also bring tens of millions of
dollars in property taxes into New York City's treasury. The Port
Authority, as a public entity, pays the city $25 million a year in
lieu of taxes, about one-quarter of what the Giuliani
administration says the building would generate if it were
privately owned.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how much the lessee would have to pay in taxes would be
subject to negotiation, but Pataki and several commissioners said
they would work to make sure the city got its fair share. Pataki
said the deal would be ``one of the largest and one of the most
exciting real estate deals in the history of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman declined to comment on the lease deal. Her office,
however, released a statement that appeared to play down Pataki's
role in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Whitman and Governor Cuomo agreed long ago that the
Port Authority should focus on its core mission, and that is the
transportation mission, and divest itself from nontransportation
related activities,'' said Gene Herman, a spokesman for Whitman.
``Governor Whitman is pleased that Governor Pataki has joined in on
this issue and that the Port Authority is taking the direction that
she and Cuomo agreed on in 1994 and started with the sale of the
Vista Hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the arrangement being considered by the authority, known
as a net lease, the lessee would take financial control of the
complex, receiving the rent and maintaining and improving the
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The authority commissioners are not considering selling the
Trade Center outright for several reasons. For one, the authority
would have to pay back hundreds of millions of dollars in
outstanding bonds if it sold the complex. For another, a buyer
would probably have to pay full property taxes on the complex,
which would bring down the price the complex could command.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Port Authority built the Trade Center in 1970, the
complex has been the anchor of the financial district and has
helped stimulate the development of dozens of other office
buildings. As midtown office space has tightened in recent years,
the authority has been able to command higher rents at the Trade
Center. It now has 350 tenants, including, among recent arrivals,
Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Bankers Trust and Oppenheimer
Funds.

LETTER TO JUDICIARY PANEL FROM STARR'S DEPUTY
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: with BC-CLINTON-CONGRESS-NYT) 
(cb) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following is the letter sent on Tuesday to
Representative Henry J. Hyde, the Illinois Republican who is
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and Representative John
Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the committee's ranking Democrat, from
Robert J. Bittman, the deputy Whitewater independent counsel. The
letter, released by Kenneth W. Starr, the Whitewater counsel, was
in response to one to the committee on Tuesday from President
Clinton's lawyers complaining about what they said were omissions
in Starr's report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Today, you have received a letter from David Kendall and Charles
Ruff, the President's attorneys, that complains about two alleged
omissions in the referral the Office of Independent Counsel sent to
Congress on Sept. 9. Their letter is wrong on both counts _ so
clearly wrong that the letter is obviously an intentional effort to
mislead the committee and the public.
</P>
<P>
   First, Messrs. Kendall and Ruff contend that the referral
ignored Ms. Lewinsky's testimony that ``no one ever asked me to
lie.'' Letter at 2. In fact, the referral in two places recounts
Ms. Lewinsky's testimony to that effect. On page 23 of the official
printed version of H. Doc. 105-310, the referral states: ``While
the President did not expressly instruct her to lie, according to
Ms. Lewinsky, he did suggest misleading cover stories.'' On page
174, the referral states: ``Ms. Lewinsky has stated that the
President never explicitly told her to lie.'' Rather, as the
referral points out, Ms. Lewinsky stated that she ``knew what that
meant'' when the President called her and suggested false cover
stories that they could both use under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Messrs. Kendall and Ruff contend that the referral
ignored Ms. Lewinsky's testimony that she was not ``promised a job
for my silence.'' In fact, on page 185, the referral carefully
explained the possible linkage between job assistance and a
witness's testimony: ``Indeed, in some cases, the witness receiving
the job assistance may not even know that the party providing the
assistance was motivated by a desire to stay on good terms with the
witness during the pending legal proceeding.'' Footnote 361 on that
page adds: ``The arrangement may not be explicitly spelled out. In
this case, for example, there is no evidence that Ms. Lewinsky
received an explicit proposal where someone said: ``I'll give you a
job if you lie under oath.'' That both Ms. Lewinsky and the
President did lie under oath, that it was critical for the
President that Ms. Lewinsky lie under oath, that the President
suggested false cover stories, and that the President provided job
assistance to Ms. Lewinsky are the facts with respect to Ground VII
that the Committee will no doubt evaluate as it continues its work.
</P>
<P>
   We do not plan to respond to every false allegation that we
anticipate Mr. Kendall and Mr. Ruff will make over the ensuing
weeks and months. This first letter should give pause to all who
might be inclined to take them at their word. It is noteworthy,
however, that their letter accepts the credibility of Ms. Lewinsky
on these issues, which should indicate that they have no intention
of challenging Ms. Lewinsky's credibility on other matters.
</P>
<P>
   If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FERNDALE, N.Y. _ Not long ago, a sumptuous slice of fresh foie
gras, cut from the fat-rich liver of a force-fed duck or goose, was
a rarity on American menus. Even as French restaurants flourished
in the 1980's, desperate chefs usually had to settle for canned
pates. Those willing to defy federal restrictions on imports of raw
poultry even had the delicacy smuggled from France inside fish
bellies.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, though, top restaurants across the nation are awash in
fresh foie gras. The delicacy is so abundant that chefs have
indulged in American-style innovations that might make a Frenchman
faint: barbecued foie gras, foie gras pizza, foie gras quesadillas.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of this pipeline can be traced largely to a former
bond trader from Great Neck, N.Y., and an Israeli-born
duck-breeding expert, who have teamed up to become the largest
producer of fresh foie gras in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, Michael Ginor and Izzy Yanay, own and operate
Hudson Valley Foie Gras and Duck Products, a 200-acre farm here in
Sullivan County, two hours northwest of Manhattan. They also
operate three other farms.
</P>
<P>
   Their company, formed almost eight years ago, is one of only two
in the country that produce fresh foie gras; the other, Sonoma Foie
Gras, is in California. Hudson Valley Foie Gras estimates that it
produces about 80 percent of the product made in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did it because I could never get it here, and when I did,
it wasn't any good,'' said Ginor, 34, the company's president, who
first tasted foie gras 15 years ago outside Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   David Waltuck, chef and owner of Chanterelle in Manhattan, said
he would probably not be serving foie gras if Hudson Valley had not
started up. ``The stuff from Hudson Valley is the best,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To become the kings of foie gras _ they sell 220 tons a year of
livers as yellow as the cornmeal they feed their ducks _ Ginor and
Yanay, the general manager, have had to surmount problems that had
long held back the industry.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, disease has stymied large goose farms in the United
States and in Europe, and to many Americans, foie gras still means
goose. Today, however, goose foie gras is made only in very small
quantities in Israel, Hungary and France. Everywhere else, foie
gras comes from ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Besides disease, geese have more fragile necks, an obstacle to
feeding. And the rest of the goose ages much faster than the liver,
rendering the breast and other parts inedible, and making the
process not very economical.
</P>
<P>
   Goose liver also contains a high percentage of fat, so it can be
cooked only at low temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   As for duck foie gras, efforts to use Muscovy ducks have not
been economical, because they generally breed only six months of
the year, require lots of care and, to a lesser degree, have the
same melting problem as geese.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970's, though, Yanay, an expert in poultry
production who was then working in Israel, made a breakthrough. He
developed an artificial insemination method to cross large numbers
of female Pekin ducks with male Muscovy ducks to produce
disease-resistant, but sterile, moulards. The result was that birds
with some Muscovy duck characteristics could be bred year-round in
large numbers. Better yet, the moulard foie gras is easier to cook
than goose or Muscovy foie gras. It is also, many say, more
flavorful than Muscovy foie gras.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moulard is so perfect for foie gras production,'' Ginor
said, ``that 70 percent of the livers harvested in the world now
come from moulard.''
</P>
<P>
   Yanay came to the United States from Israel in the early 1980's.
With some financial backing, he worked for a while with
Commonwealth Farms here to get a domestic fresh foie gras industry
started. But acrimony developed before the industry did, and Yanay,
48, soon left the company.
</P>
<P>
   Ginor, meanwhile, spent the 80's getting an M.B.A. from New York
University and then made a small fortune as a bond trader and
salesman. He was born in Seattle, the son of a Boeing engineer, and
raised in Israel and on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   His decision to concentrate on foie gras came after he ate what
he said was particularly awful foie gras in 1989. A complaint to
the chef led him to the owners of D'Artagnan, a wholesaler of game
and meat products in Newark. They referred him to Yanay, who was
driving a truck after his departure from Commonwealth Farms.
</P>
<P>
   Ginor formed a partnership with Yanay in 1990. Ginor and a
relative anted up $1.3 million to buy an old chicken farm not far
from Commonwealth Farms, which they later bought for $1.4 million
in 1992. Ginor also hounded chefs across the country to try his
product, and established links with wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 and 1994, he fended off letter-writing campaigns and
demonstrations by animal-rights activists who cited foie gras as
one of the most cruel animal food products because of what the
French call gavage: forcing the birds to swallow up to a pound of
feed three times a day so that their livers grow to as much as 12
times their normal size.
</P>
<P>
   Yanay says the treatment of the ducks is no crueler than many
other things done to animals raised and killed for food.
</P>
<P>
   The lambasting by animal-rights activists apparently has had
little effect on aficionados of fine food. So popular has fresh
foie gras become that earlier this year Hudson Valley was sold out
of product, leaving chefs screaming for more foie gras.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the farm has increased production, and Hudson Valley
now sells an average of 7,500 pounds of liver each week, up from
2,700 pounds in 1992 (the average liver weighs about 1.5 pounds).
The company's annual sales of all its products total $9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson Valley gets about $50 for all the parts of each bird it
sells; the liver alone fetches about $28 to $36 a pound, depending
on the grade. Byproducts include the breast, legs, feathers and
duck fat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sell everything but the quack,'' Ginor said.

   LOS ANGELES _ This isn't quite the triumphant homecoming USC
offensive lineman Ken Bowen expected when he learned the Trojans
scheduled Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen, a native of Orlando and longtime Seminoles fan, expected
to return to the Sunshine State as a starter and one of USC's most
prominent linemen.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he has dropped to second string on the depth chart and
even practiced a little with the scout team on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what I always envisioned when I found out we had
signed the game,'' Bowen said. ``I was starting then. But things
don't always work out the way we want them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowen has been hampered by a torn ligament in his elbow,
although he seemed in danger of losing his starting job when he was
healthy last spring. He is wearing a padded brace and estimates he
is about 90 percent healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, I'll get in the rotation for some time,'' Bowen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has lost his starting position, Bowen had to find
tickets for about 20 family members and friends that will be coming
to Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to swindle some out of some guys,'' Bowen said.
</P>
<P>
   He's already warned his teammates what to expect before the
game, when Florida State's mascot, Chief Osceola, comes out on his
horse, Renegade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them how excited the crowd will be when Renegade comes
on the field and (Chief Osceola) points that spear at you.''
</P>

   __ Here comes the rain: There's been a change in the weather
forecast for Tallahassee. The revised report now calls for rain and
a high of 80 degrees Saturday. There is also some concern that
Hurricane Georges could move up the state and approach Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I better start putting my rain game plan together,''
USC coach Paul Hackett said. ``I guess the ball will be wet. I
hadn't even dreamed of thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   If it does rain, Hackett said he didn't think either team would
have an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a really explosive guy (tailback Travis Minor),
but I think we do, too (Chad Morton),'' Hackett said. ``The
question is, will they be able to keep their footing?''
</P>
<P>
   One option on a rainy field, Hackett said, is to run more
between the tackles and run fewer sweeps. Since most USC running
plays go behind right guard Travis Claridge, it wouldn't mean much
of a difference.
</P>
<P>
   __ Harris might play: Tight end Antoine Harris missed practice
Thursday and had tests done his injured ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would imagine we'll have him,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Another starter, center Matt McShane (strained knee ligament),
returned to practice and Hackett said he might be available.
Linebacker Mark Cusano, defensive end Lawrence Larry and strong
safety Grant Pearsall will play but won't start.
</P>
<P>
   __ Superstitious: With its first road game, the offense would
normally switch to wearing white jerseys in practice this week.
However, they have remained in the home cardinals in a break from
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Trojans started 3-0, it was decided not to change any
routines from previous weeks.

MCGUIRE FAILS TO ANSWER SOSA'S LATEST CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ A shuttle bus driver poked his head into the hotel
lobby on Wednesday afternoon and quickly morphed into a town crier:
Sosa's got two, Sosa's got two.
</P>
<P>
   Only minutes had passed since the Chicago Cubs' Sammy Sosa had
raised the goose bumps on a surreal home-run chase once again,
hitting his 64th and 65th homers of the season in Milwaukee on
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa had caught the Cardinals' Mark McGwire. But each time
McGwire's grasp on home-run supremacy has been threatened by his
good friend, he has separated himself from the tie like a rocket
from its booster. The thrill of the chase seems to send a surge
through McGwire, allowing him to turn ordinary fly balls into tall
tales as they land in bleachers never before reached.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday night, McGwire failed to supply a snappy
comeback to Sosa in the face of his pitching equal on the
intimidation scale: Houston power pitcher Randy Johnson (10-1).
</P>
<P>
   Sensing the magnitude of the matchup, the Busch Stadium crowd of
38,997 _ a crowd that put the Cardinals over the 3 million mark in
attendance for the first time since 1989 _ was buzzing with
anticipation even though the Astros put their 7-1 victory away
early.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark, he's got a terrific ability to rise to the occasion,''
said Cardinal Manager Tony LaRussa before the game. ``That's why
tonight, in this terrific, classic confrontation, he's got a chance
to do some damage.''
</P>
<P>
   He had little chance, though. Although Johnson had said ``no one
wants to see me walk him,'' that's exactly what he did in the first
and third innings, much to the dismay of the crowd. It did not look
as if Johnson was pitching around McGwire, who went 1 for 3 on the
night. Although he gave up just one run, Johnson had trouble with
his location much of the game _ allowing eight hits and six walks
to go with eight strikeouts over seven innings. The 6-foot-10-inch,
225-pound Johnson was not as dominating as usual.
</P>
<P>
   But as Johnson settled in and began to challenge McGwire, he
escaped shaken but unscathed. After fouling off a 97-mile-an-hour
fastball, McGwire hit a sharp single off of him in the fifth and
launched a towering fly ball to the left-field warning track in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The excitement leading up to this physics face-off, was
palpable. As the crowd filed in, they could look up at the
scoreboard looming over center field and see a crew changing the
numbers for the home-run totals: McGwire 65, Sosa 65.
</P>
<P>
   Not once during the season has McGwire failed to meet Sosa's
challenge. The most visible evidence of this was on Aug. 19 when
the two men drew flashbulb fire as they played against each other.
Early in the game, Sosa, for the only time this season, nudged
ahead of McGwire by hitting his 48th of the year. McGwire's
response? He dispatched his 48th and 49th home runs by the end of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 31, after Sosa had tied McGwire at 55, McGwire hit two
home runs the next day. Since then, the two have been tied twice
more.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's answer to Sosa has been swift. Is it this easy for
McGwire? Some, including Sosa, have suggested that McGwire has the
edge in controlling the pace of this race because the Cardinals are
out of the playoffs. No pressure, no holding back. McGwire can
relax and swing freely.
</P>
<P>
   Just the mention of this theory on which player has it easier,
McGwire or Sosa, makes LaRussa bristle. Although he will tell you
that Sosa would get his vote as Most Valuable Player, ``but just
barely'' based on the Cubs more successful season, LaRussa believes
McGwire has a much more difficult task.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cubs are in contention, and the adrenaline is pumping and
it's easier to bear down,'' LaRussa said. ``It's easier to play and
try to help your team than to be selfish. You bite your tongue as
much as you can, but when there's an inference that Mark's team is
out of contention and that means he can focus on home runs. Well,
in other words, they're taking away from what Mark has done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that anyone around here has made a big deal about
Mark having 150 walks and Sammy having 70. You give Mark 80 more
at-bats, how many home runs would he have? But you don't say that
because you don't want to take away from anyone else. At the same
time, don't come around here saying that it's easier for Mark.
That's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   It's never just another game when McGwire and Johnson meet,
especially now. On this night, Johnson was able to stop McGwire
from replying to Sosa's magic earlier in the day. &QL;

CANDIDATE CRITICIZES STATE'S ROLE IN CHILD'S DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ The Democratic candidate for governor, Barbara
Kennelly, criticized Gov. John Rowland and his administration
Wednesday for failing to prevent the death of a child under state
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Her criticism came on the day that Lynne Friend, the child's
aunt and guardian, was charged with murder in the death of the
child, David Ryan Keeley, a 6-year-old who was found dead from
blunt trauma to the head in the New Haven apartment of his aunt and
uncle on Aug. 12. The uncle, Robert Friend, was charged with three
counts of risk of injury to a minor.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Child Fatality Review Panel found last week that the
state Department of Children and Families ignored repeated reports
from school officials and others that the boy, known as Ryan, was
being abused by his aunt, and had failed to implement
recommendations from previous reports that might have prevented
Ryan's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The child did everything but write on the wall in red crayon,
`They're trying to kill me,''' Mrs. Kennelly said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third death of a child under state supervision this
year in which the panel criticized the department's actions.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, Ryan told the police less than a year
ago, ``Sometimes when I'm bad, Auntie throws me to the ground and
they hit me hard.'' A department social worker closed the case,
finding no risk to the child, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the child's death, Rowland has fired a regional supervisor
and transferred five supervisors, but on Wednesday Mrs. Kennelly
said that the problems lay not with individual social workers but
with how the department was run. The problems are not new _ the
department has been under a consent decree since 1991 to increase
staffing and improve services _ and Rowland, she said, should be
doing more.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly said that as governor, she would ``move my desk''
into the Department of Children and Families and remain there
``until things are straightened out.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean Pagani, Rowland's campaign spokesman, said the governor
essentially had ``moved his desk'' into the department, giving it
much attention during his administration. ``It is unfortunate that
Mrs. Kennelly is using the death of this child as a political
issue,'' he said.

GERSHWIN ANNIVERSARY: A COMPOSER WITH MANY FACETS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ We don't often think of George Gershwin as a
revolutionary or a prophet. There has always been enough in the
Schubertian grace of the songs, the fascinating rhythm and the
ambiguous harmonies to keep us happy. Yet Gershwin's ability to
disrupt the boundaries between high and low culture may end up as
his most important gift to us.
</P>
<P>
   Note, for example, the benign confusion that hovered over
Michael Tilson Thomas' concert with the San Francisco Symphony at
Carnegie Hall Wednesday night. Was this a symphonic event, a pops
concert or a convocation of big-band jazz? Were those torch singers
or opera singers? Were we on Broadway or at La Scala? Did it
matter? I think Gershwin was telling us with his usual directness
that we were where he wanted us to be.
</P>
<P>
   A spiffy season-opening crowd, well fed and lubricated
beforehand and joined by Hillary Rodham Clinton in her upstairs
box, couldn't quite figure out where they were either, sitting
quietly for the Overture to ``Of Thee I Sing'' and the Second
Rhapsody but happily clapping after every number from the opera
``Porgy and Bess.''
</P>
<P>
   Gershwin was born 100 years ago this Saturday, and this
particular evening began a string of events: at Carnegie, at
Lincoln Center and elsewhere. With Frederica von Stade singing
songs and the orchestra playing ``An American in Paris'' as a
finale, Thomas' program seemed to be tweaking both ends of musical
taste, from the ambitions of pop culture toward ``a touch of
class'' to the smugness of music's classical elite toward anything
at a lower altitude than itself.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gershwin's supreme self-confidence and his uneasy upward
mobility show in the Second Rhapsody, an astonishing piece that
demonstrates the tonal atonality to which his music was pointing
when he died at the age of 39. This is abrasive, often brutal
music, quick to change time schemes and unafraid of naked
dissonance.
</P>
<P>
   The florid piano scales and runs sound not quite natural, as if
Gershwin felt himself a trespasser in the concert hall and had to
use stock piano virtuosity to gain acceptance. Thomas took the
piano part with great flair, making up some of the gaps Gershwin
left in the score and playing some difficult music very well.
</P>
<P>
   We know ``Porgy and Bess'' better but don't have the chance to
experience the orchestra part from a raised stage very often. Nor
do we hear it negotiated with the fineness managed by the San
Francisco players Wednesday night. This was beautiful playing. Both
``Porgy'' and the Second Rhapsody are a maze of meter and tempo
changes; the harmony strays far from the key at hand and yet
somehow remains firmly rooted in it.
</P>
<P>
   Gershwin so often beguiles us with his lyric qualities that we
don't always notice the sophistication and complexity of his art.
There is speculation he might have ended up a 12-tone composer, but
it would certainly have been a music that hung on firmly to its
popular roots.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Audra McDonald in the numbers from ``Porgy and Bess'' and Ms.
von Stade in three Gershwin songs seemed at opposite ends of the
Gershwin puzzle: Ms. McDonald interpolating ornaments and slides
and thus adding to the ``blackness'' of Gershwin's style; Ms. von
Stade exercising a hard-working charm in an attempt to convert an
opera technique into a popular one.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McDonald was breathlessly emotional but operated with a
style and control that made excess work in her favor. Ms. von
Stade's relentless good cheer entertained her audience more than it
did me. Brian Stokes Mitchell sang and danced exuberantly in the
``Porgy'' sequence.
</P>
<P>
   Recreating Gershwin today is not easy, as this odd collection of
pieces showed. Like Schubert, his music has outlived the original
formats. Schubert's amateur entertainments no longer exist, nor do
the assembly-line musicals of the Broadway Gershwin wrote for. It
is the songs that survive in the healthiest and most relaxed state.
I would have loved to hear more of them Wednesday night, sung more
simply.
</P>
<P>
   If music keeps heading the way it is, Gershwin might well turn
out to be the next century's prototypical patron saint. Classical
music keeps retreating to esoteric high ground and chides the
public for not being able to follow it. Popular music devours the
world, sometimes for the better, sometimes not. The important music
that is going to be written has to have someplace to go, and it may
find the concert world too exclusive and the pop world too
inclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Why not banish categories, Gershwin seems to suggest. If his
music sometimes reached tentatively toward the concert hall
Wednesday night, it at least assured us that true beauty is where
you find it.

 &HT;    CMA show: How about some country with that pop
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The producers of the 32nd annual Country Music Awards
must have thought they were going to really kickstart the evening
by putting sexy Shania Twain, the biggest selling country female
artist ever, first on the bill. Sure enough, as the house lights
went down, here she came -- skin-tight bell bottoms, beefy backup
singers and enough pyrotechnics to rival World Championship
Wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   But like an overdone dessert, it didn't work. As Shania shook
her thang, the star-studded audience gathered for Nashville's
annual fete (and, no doubt, many fans in their dens at home) looked
like tourists in a Chevy Blazer who had just been sideswiped by a
Ferrari Testarossa. Quick! Get out the Triple-A road maps and get
us back on course.
</P>
<P>
   If 1998 has been the year of country music's identity crisis,
fueled by sagging sales and cries of selling out to pop, Wednesday
night's awards showed signs of what Nashville's going to do to fix
things: get back to basics.
</P>
<P>
   The list of winners in major categories was about as alternative
as a roll call of deacons at church. Once again, traditionalist
George Strait walked off with the trophy for male vocalist of the
year, with Monticello's own Trisha Yearwood copping the award for
female vocalist. Garth Brooks was named entertainer of the year.
Kix Brooks and Ronnie Dunn proved their staying power with the
vocal duo award, and underscored the evening's strong return to
roots with a live performance of Roger Miller's 1965 hit ''Husbands
and Wives.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most surprisingly satisfying moments went to
longtime Nashville singer/songwriter Steve Wariner, who finally was
recognized for his two-decade career by winning single of the year
and song of the year for the touching ballad ''Holes In the Floor
of Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there were the MTV influences -- Faith Hill performing the
Top-40 crossover hit ''This Kiss,'' Alan Jackson doing his
hot-hot-hot new single (''I'll Go On Loving You'') with big-screen
videos that looked like underwater shots of Tarzan finding his
mate, and Martina McBride decked out like a champagne lady from the
Lawrence Welk show. But even though newcomers Dixie Chicks (winners
of the Horizon award for best new artist) were dressed like
Madonna, their bluegrass-based sound was pure Bill Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the sweetest win of all went to Patty Loveless for vocal
event of the year. Ironically, many radio stations refused to play
her duet with George Jones, ''You Don't Seem to Miss Me,'' calling
it ''too country.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's time to reconsider things. At least Nashville seems
to think so.

THE POP LIFE: MUSICAL DAMAGE IN STARR REPORT 
</HEADLINE>

(lb) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This month contemporary pop music received two major setbacks.
First came the MTV Video Music Awards, which collected some of the
biggest singers of the moment to illuminate a very derivative,
infertile period in music. Then came the Starr report, which may
have done even more musical damage, helping to prove that the
generation gap in musical taste is disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   Buried in the report is a deleted computer file written by
Monica Lewinsky about the Canadian singer and Lilith Fair founder
Sarah McLachlan. ``When I was hiding out in your office for a
half-hour, I noticed you had the new Sarah McLachlan CD,'' she
wrote. ``I have it, too, and it's wonderful. Whenever I listen to
song No. 5, I think of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as disturbing as the fact that the song, ``Surfacing,'' is
about a person with an obsessive love is the fact that both the
president, now 52, and his former intern, now 24, listen to the
same music.
</P>
<P>
   It is often said that today's big rock bands (Dave Matthews
Band, Oasis, Radiohead, Phish) are just newer models of the
Beatles, the Grateful Dead and others from past eras. But the White
House musical evidence gets even stranger. Ms. Lewinsky's note
continues with reference to another song of obsessive love, ``That
song and Billie Holiday's version of `I'll Be Seeing You' are
guaranteed to put me to tears when it comes to you!''
</P>
<P>
   Add to this the fact that President Clinton gave Ms. Lewinsky an
Annie Lennox CD, and you have two people 28 years apart united by
three singers, ranging from an icon of the present generation to
one of a generation that preceded both of them.
</P>
<P>
   It took rock music 14 years to get from Elvis Presley to
Woodstock. And as Woodstock was occurring, the roots of more
extreme forms of rock like heavy metal, alternative rock and punk
were being laid by bands like the Stooges, the Velvet Underground
and MC5.
</P>
<P>
   Now, nearly 30 years later, things have not come much further.
Rock is no longer a tool of divisiveness but of generational
accord. It gives people something in common: Grandfather can tell
the little ones what it was like to see the Rolling Stones way back
when.
</P>
<P>
   Between the easy access to music and information on the
Internet, the rise of chain stores selling all genres of music and
the trend for radio stations and video channels to devote more time
to nostalgia, it is much easier for younger people to widen their
musical knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that there is no generation gap in music.
Many older people don't understand the repetitive electronic thud
of techno, but the music has yet to be culturally significant
enough to create a real divide between old and young.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the only new type of popular music that has emerged and
spoken to one generation while alienating another is rap, lending
credence to the theory that the generation gap in white culture has
been replaced by one in black families.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, while President Clinton may listen to Sarah
McLachlan, one of the musicians he is most closely identified with
is Kenny G, who has performed in the White House many times. Liking
Kenny G, however, may be more evidence of a taste gap than a
generation gap.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nonetheless, a new era in White House performances began on
Sept. 16 when Lou Reed became the first rock musician to perform at
a state dinner. Reed was invited by the visiting Czech president,
Vaclav Havel, whose Velvet Revolution was inspired (at least in
name) by Reed's former band, the Velvet Underground.
</P>
<P>
   With Stevie Wonder, Laurie Anderson, Ric Ocasek of the Cars and
Vice President Al Gore in attendance, Reed performed a 35-minute
set. Though he threw in some politically critical numbers, Reed
took time out from his set to support the president, saying: ``Your
private life should be your private life. This is a smear
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   A music executive recently remarked that although pop musicians
usually avoid interviews about political issues they are not
directly involved in, they have been lining up to talk about the
recent White House affair in magazines.
</P>
<P>
   In a celebrity culture, presidents and pop stars have more in
common, in particular the distress over having their private lives
made public. Now, with the president caught engaging in rock-star
behavior with a young groupie, they have even more in common. But
it seems that only rock stars can get away with rock-star behavior.
