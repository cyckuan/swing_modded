<P>
   WASHINGTON, _ In a high-stakes battle to continue their
prosecution of President Clinton, House managers interviewed Monica
S. Lewinsky for just under two hours Sunday and said she would be
an impressive witness who would help the Senate ''determine the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Senate set to vote this week on whether to allow
witnesses to be deposed, senators stepped up a search for ways to
restore bipartisanship to their chamber and bring the trial to a
swift conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The accelerating chain of events came as the Senate headed into
a decisive week, facing two votes that could either stop the trial
or prolong it. Negotiations were under way to see whether the
Senate could find a way to skip those votes entirely and jump ahead
to a final decision on the two articles of impeachment this week.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring complaints from Democratic senators, three members of
the House prosecution team _ Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, Bill
McCollum of Florida and Ed Bryant of Tennessee _ spent the late
afternoon questioning the young woman described by Rep. Henry J.
Hyde as ``the most important witness in this whole drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Three lawyers for Ms. Lewinsky and a representative from the
Office of the Independent Counsel, Michael Emmick, also sat in on
the questioning.
</P>
<P>
   An associate of Ms. Lewinsky's said the prosecutors once again
asked about the chain of events surrounding her decision to return
gifts from the president to his secretary, Betty Currie, an act the
Republicans have cited as an element of their obstruction of
justice charge against Clinton. The managers also asked her about
assistance by Vernon Jordan, a friend of the President, in
searching for a job in New York. The managers did not ask for
details of her sexual relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was certainly impressed with Miss Lewinsky's intelligence
and poise,'' Hutchinson said as the men emerged from the interview
in the Mayflower Hotel just after 6 p.m. He said she would be a
witness who would help the Senate ``determine the truth.'' McCollum
said, ``We found that she might be a very helpful witness to the
Senate if called.''
</P>
<P>
   Plato Cacheris, one of Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers, who attended the
session, said, ``She added nothing to the record that is already
sitting before the Senate.'' He urged the House managers not to
call her before the Senate. ``We hope for Monica and her family
that this long nightmare will come to a quick conclusion,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In scenes reminiscent of the frenzy ignited a year ago by the
news that the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, was
investigating whether Clinton had conspired to cover up an affair
with Ms. Lewinsky, scores of reporters, photographers and
television cameramen crowded the sidewalk outside the downtown
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky arrived there late Saturday afternoon, compelled by
a federal judge to cooperate with the House impeachment team. Her
surprise return to Washington _ and Hyde's request to the
independent counsel to obtain the court order, convulsed the Senate
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   There were conflicting reports on Sunday night about whether Ms.
Lewinsky had offered a clarification of an earlier statement, a
clarification that undercut the White House defense that Clinton
had not sought to influence how his gifts to her were returned.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican counsel at the interview said that Ms. Lewinsky
said on Sunday that she might have received a telephone call from
Ms. Currie before giving her the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   In previous testimony, Ms. Lewinsky said that she thought the
gifts had been given to Ms. Currie at about 2 p.m., which was
before she received the telephone call from Ms. Currie at about
3:30 p.m. That account would have suggested that Ms. Currie could
not have been acting at Clinton's direction.
</P>
<P>
   Two other people familiar with the interview on Sunday said that
Ms. Lewinsky had nat made any significant change in her account.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that House Republicans would have to make a persuasive
argument for their witness list, several Senate Republicans
expressed skepticism Sunday on the television talk shows about the
need to hear from the principals in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want the Senate to become a spectacle, a scene,''
said Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Alal, who said on NBC's ``Meet the
Press'' that he would support calling only witnesses who ``can add
a lot.'' Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, said she had not yet been
convinced that witnesses were needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, if we do proceed, we want to make sure that it
doesn't turn out to be `The Jerry Springer Show,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican, Sen. Slade Gorton of Washington, said he
hoped that the two parties could find a way to skip to the final
arguments and a final vote ``and get to it as promptly as is
consistent with doing the impartial justice we all raised our right
hands and said that we would do.''
</P>
<P>
   The managers will have to be careful in writing their final
proposal for witnesses in order to counter the growing unease in
the Senate about the trial's running into another month.
</P>
<P>
   With even some Republicans troubled by Ms. Lewinsky's sudden
reappearance in their midst, Sen. Bob Torricelli, D-N.J., said in
an interview that the managers' use of the court to obtain access
to Ms. Lewinsky was ``a miscalculation of such proportion that it
probably increases pressure on the Republican leadership to get
this matter resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   The managers were not expected to finalize their witness list
until Monday at the earliest, and one Republican aide said before
the session with Ms. Lewinsky that she was the only solid one on
the list. The managers were also weighing calling aides and
advisers to the president, among them Jordan, Ms. Currie, John
Podesta and Sidney Blumenthal, as well as Kathleen Willey, another
woman who has said Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance to her.
</P>
<P>
   But the aide said the managers were concerned that the
president's advisers would not be cooperative witnesses and that
the Senate might bristle at the introduction of Ms. Willey.
Separately, Republican investigators also talked to Dick Morris,
Clinton's former political adviser. The managers have said the
president's state of mind was important when Morris told him a poll
showed the nation would never forgive his conduct with Ms.
Lewinsky.

 WASHINGTON: Ms. Lewinsky. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the prosecutors prepared their presentation, Sen. Trent Lott,
the majority leader, sought to keep pressure on the White House. He
said he would go ahead with plans to submit written questions to
the president on Monday, even though White House lawyers have
backed away from a statement by Greg Craig, the White House special
counsel, indicating that the president might take written
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to prepare a letter in hopes that the
president will respond to the senators' interrogatories,'' Lott
said in a statement. He said answers from Clinton's lawyers ``is
not a substitute for the president answering the questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is set for two critical votes this week, one to
dismiss the trial outright and one to decide whether to allow
witnesses. Senators from both parties said various avenues were
being explored to see whether the Senate could somehow end the
trial this week. Several officials said Sen. Tom Daschle, the
minority leader, had even approached Lott to explore whether there
was a way to skip those two votes outright and move directly to
some final vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like going to an opera that's not all that great,''
said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. ``The tenor's been stabbed, and as
he staggers across the stage and continues to sing, you want to
stand up and say, `You're dead, fall down!' This trial is like
that. The tenor has died. Bring down the curtain.''
</P>
<P>
   But it seems unlikely that the Senate will provide the unanimous
consent necessary to change the vote sequence it has set up. And it
was also uncertain Sunday night whether the Senate's final votes
would simply be on the articles of impeachment. Lott was said by
senators to be exploring whether the Senate could vote on findings
of fact on the two articles of impeachment and then take a separate
vote on whether to convict Clinton and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are convinced there's sufficient evidence of
obstruction of justice to suggest that the president did that,''
said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who favors such an approach.
``But a lot of senators are uneasy about taking the next step, and
are asking does that justify his removal?''
</P>
<P>
   She said of the idea of voting on a finding of facts separate
from conviction would be ``tougher than a censure.'' But one
Democratic official said Democrats would not be likely to go along
with such a plan.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate does go ahead with the votes on the motions to
dismiss the case and on witnesses, several Republicans say it is
possible that six or more of their members would join with the 45
Democrats to block witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a growing feeling in our conference that it would be
nice if that motion did not succeed,'' said one Republican senator,
who spoke on condition that he not be identified. ``But many
members may have to hold their noses and vote for it for a lot of
internal political reasons for our party. So it's not clear who is
going to save us from ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., predicted that the motion to
dismiss the case, which could be voted on as early as Monday, would
fail. ``I believe the motion to depose witnesses will be very close
and could go either way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats suggested that they would drop the effort to
dismiss the case if they could be guaranteed that witnesses would
not be called. ``If enough Republicans would declare themselves
against witnesses, I believe we could completely avoid the vote on
dismissal,'' said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to patch together bipartisanship after a fractious
Saturday and avoid the party line vote against dismissing the case,
some senators said they would like to see a bipartisan caucus of
the Senate on Monday, to be held in the Old Senate Chamber, where a
bipartisan plan for the trial was hammered out two weeks ago.
``Perhaps many of these things can be worked out,'' Ms. Snowe said
in an interview. ``There are a lot of things in play. I think
tomorrow could be critical.''
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment trial is to resume Monday, and some senators may
still want to submit questions through Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist. Otherwise, unless a new procedure is negotiated, the
Senate moves to the motion to dismiss the case. The House
prosecutors and the White House each have an hour to debate the
motion.

IOC EXPELS 6 MEMBERS TIED TO SALT LAKE CITY PAYMENTS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ Taking unprecedented disciplinary action
and acknowledging widespread wrongdoing, the president of the
International Olympic Committee on Sunday expelled six members for
receiving improper benefits in the Salt Lake City bribery scandal.
</P>
<P>
   A seventh member resigned, one was given a warning and three
remained under investigation in the biggest corruption scandal in
Olympic history, one that involved the reception of cash payments,
tuition aid, medical treatment and lavish gifts totaling an
estimated $800,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the six expelled members, and a fifth who resigned, were
from Africa, but senior IOC officials stressed that the misbehavior
was not geographical, racial or cultural in nature. Europeans,
South Americans and an Asian member have also been linked to this
far-reaching scandal. One of the expelled members received cash and
benefits totaling $216,000 for himself and family members. Another
member under investigation is a member of the IOC's executive board
and is a candidate for president of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the expulsions, the IOC's executive board made
sweeping recommendations to overhaul the extravagant and tainted
system of bidding on the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The board proposed to take away the general membership's most
important duty, voting on which cities receive the Winter and
Summer Games, giving the job to a smaller electoral college
composed of eight IOC members, three athletes and four other sports
officials. The board also proposed an experimental halt on allowing
IOC members to visit bid cities, where they are wined and dined and
treated to lavish benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's actions amounted to an admission that, after finding
that 13 current members, and a 14th who is dead, were involved in
the Salt Lake City scandal, a full 10 percent of the IOC membership
acted inappropriately and that the IOC cannot trust that its
current 106 members will behave properly in choosing which cities
which host the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``These members have done great harm to the Olympic ideal,''
Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the IOC, said of the dismissed
members. ``Now their greatest service to the Olympic movement is to
accept their fate.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing beleaguered but defiant, the 78-year-old Samaranch
apologized for unethical behavior by IOC members but he deflected
personal blame for the scandal and said he had never considered
resigning.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch said he planned to seek a vote of confidence from IOC
members in March to finish the final two years of his term. He is
expected to receive approval overwhelmingly, given that he
appointed 80 percent of the current members. He also distanced
himself from the scandal, saying that more than half of the 14
members involved had joined the IOC before he became president in
1980.
</P>
<P>
   He also reiterated that the 2002 Winter Games would remain in
Salt Lake City, and that the 2000 Summer Games would stay in
Sydney, Australia, which is also immersed in a bidding scandal.
Samaranch did say, however, that the IOC's investigation of the
soiled bidding process would be expanded to include all cities that
sought Winter and Summer Games from 1996 to 2006.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the decisions we made today will demonstrate our
resolve to never let this happen again,'' Samaranch said.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch and other senior IOC officials said that they believed
those linked to the Salt Lake City scandal made moral but not
criminal mistakes. But they also emphatically stated that Sunday's
disciplinary moves were only a first step in trying to restore
luster to the tarnished Olympic rings and in trying to reassure
nervous corporate sponsors that its besmirched system will be
reformed and outfitted with adequate safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   A quasi-independent ethics commission will be formed to monitor
the business practices of the IOC, Samaranch announced, but the
dishonored organization remains in a precarious and unresolved
position as four investigations continue into the Salt Lake City
scandal, including one by the U.S. Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   And in expanding its investigation to other bid cities, the IOC
is almost certain to be embarrassed by more revelations of untoward
behavior. Sydney, for instance, has admitted offering payments of
$35,000 apiece to two IOC members from Africa the night before its
secured a two-vote victory over Beijing to host the 2000 Summer
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the scandal could continue to mushroom if the expelled
members do not go quietly, but instead begin leveling accusations
of their own, which could further erode public and corporate
confidence in the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than a jab and less than a knockout punch, a heavy
body blow from which we're going to have to fight back,'' said
Richard Pound, an attorney from Montreal and IOC vice president who
headed the investigation of Salt Lake City. ``We're going to have
to demonstrate our good faith and not try to pretend that Salt Lake
was a hermetically sealed incident.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The six members expelled by Samaranch under a special provision
of Swiss law were Agustin Arroyo of Ecuador, Jean-Claude Ganga of
Congo Republic, Gen. Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir of the Sudan,
Lamine Keita of Mali, Charles Mukora of Kenya and Sergio Santander
Fantini of Chile.
</P>
<P>
   David Sibandze of Swaziland resigned, and Kim Un Yong of South
Korea, Vitaly Smirnov of Russia and Louis Guirandou N'Diaye of the
Ivory Coast remain under investigation. Anton Geesink of the
Netherlands received a warning because an Olympic foundation that
bears his name accepted a $5,000 check from the Salt Lake City
Olympic organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
   Two other IOC members, Bashir Attarabulsi of Libya and Pirjo
Haggman of Finland, previously resigned for their actions
concerning the Salt Lake City scandal. Rene Essomba of Cameroon,
whose daughter Sonia, received about $100,000 in tuition assistance
from Salt Lake Olympic officials, died last year.
</P>
<P>
   The expulsions must be ratified by the full IOC assembly at a
meeting on March 17 and 18. But the six ousted members will need a
two-thirds majority, or 64 votes, to gain reinstatement, Pound
said. Samaranch pointedly urged them not to fight Sunday's
dismissals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tender your resignations,'' Samaranch said. ``Do not wait to
be expelled by the session. Put an end to this ugly chapter in the
history of the Olympic Games.''
</P>
<P>
   The six who were dismissed by Samaranch were accused of
accepting cash and benefits totaling $440,710. Pound said that all
six had solicited these favors from Salt Lake City officials. He
took care not to blame Salt Lake City officials, saying that the
IOC had not acted quickly enough to stop the temptations for
inappropriate behavior that exist now that the Olympics have become
a billion-dollar business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's far better to clear up our side of the situation and not
to go around pointing fingers at anyone else,'' Pound said.
</P>
<P>
   Ganga, 64, who is also the minister of sport, tourism and
leisure in Congo Republic and one of the organizers of the African
boycott of the 1976 Summer Games in Montreal, received direct
payments of $70,010, which were deposited into his personal account
in a Salt Lake City bank, according to Pound's report. Ganga and
family members also received $17,000 in medical care and $115,000
in travel expenses, while Ganga also received $14,000 in exorbitant
gifts and entertainment, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, a relative of Arroyo's _ she has been
identified as a stepdaughter _ received living expenses totaling
$19,000; Gadir and family members received $25,000 in payments;
Keita; one of Keita's sons received $97,000 in tuition and living
expenses and air fare to attend Howard University; Mukora received
cash payments totaling $34,650; and Santander received direct
payments of $20,050.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our opinion, none of the situations regarding the
individuals proposed for expulsion was the result of accidental or
inadvertent conduct,'' Pound said. ``In each case, it was conscious
and knowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound also said that the dismissed members were being accused of
violating their Olympic oaths, not of bribery and corruption and
that no accusations were being made of criminal conduct. He said
that six of the members had pleaded their cases in person this
weekend and that some seemed genuinely shocked with presented with
the totality of the money and benefits they had received from Salt
Lake City Olympic officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put us in an impossible position, whether you meant to or
not,'' Pound said they were told.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ganga has said that he will not resign, and Santander
has said that he will take his case to the International Court of
Arbitration for Sport, which settles international sporting
disputes and has in the past acted independently of the IOC.
Santander said that he had no knowledge of one payment of $15,225
made by Salt Lake City officials.
</P>
<P>
   Ganga told IOC investigators that he distributed the cash
payments from Salt Lake City officials to Olympic committees in the
Central African Republic, Congo and Niger, and that he offered to
pay for medical treatment in Salt Lake City. In an interview with
CNN, he also claimed that his expulsion was politically motivated
by those who did not want him to challenge them for president of
the IOC when Samaranch retires.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, who is being investigated for recommending that a Russian
teenager be admitted to an American school at the request of
Smirnov, also complained that politics was at play here in an
attempt to ruin his chances for succeeding Samaranch. He is a
member of the IOC's executive board.
</P>
<P>
   Pound, Francois Carrard of Switzerland and Jacques Rogge of
Belgium, all part of the IOC investigative panel for Salt Lake
City, are considered possible replacements of Samaranch. But Pound
said ``absolutely not'' when asked whether there were any political
motivations for the disciplinary actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was unrelated,'' Pound said. ``None of us wanted to be on
a commission like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Because seven of the 14 IOC members linked to the Salt Lake City
scandal were from Africa, the IOC has been subjected to questions
about whether it was attempting to destabilize the power of African
sport. Senior IOC officials denied this, including Keba Mbaye of
Senegal, who was a member of Pound's investigative commission and
who is vice president of the International Court of Justice, as
well as the honorary chief justice of the Supreme Court of the West
African nation of Senegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who are most in need are most open to offers, offers
which sometimes verge on the provocative,'' Mbaye said. But, he
added, Pound's commission ``acted in a strictly objective way. We
in no way tried to decapitate African sports.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal by the IOC's executive board to prohibit travel by
IOC members to bid cities must be ratified by a majority of members
in March. The members must also vote by a majority to eliminate
their ability to vote as a whole on choosing Olympic host cities.
Senior IOC officials said they believed the majority would agree to
a reduced role in the bid process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IOC will rally together if the institution is under
attack,'' Pound said. ``If not under attack, it is certainly under
question.''

HARRIS MIGHT PLAY MUSICAL STARTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ To be a Los Angeles Laker with job
security is to be, well, Shaquille O'Neal. To be anyone else means
there are no guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Shaq will be the starting center when the season opens Feb. 5
and Derek Fisher is the probable starting point guard. But there
are no other 100 percent certainties on a Lakers squad that is the
deepest in years.
</P>
<P>
   But with a compacted 50-game schedule, coach Del Harris also
figures the starting five is likely to change based on fatigue and
matchups. That said, Harris might employ a unique approach to the
Kobe Bryant question. Bryant is by many accounts ready to start but
is blocked at shooting guard by Eddie Jones and at small forward by
Rick Fox. So how about a three-man weave in the lineup?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, this year we may change around and there might
be different people starting. You never know, we might even rotate
Kobe, Eddie and Rick,'' Harris said in a thinking-out-loud moment.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant can play both guard and forward, so on any given night
the Lakers could start any two of those three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that might be something we do there as opposed to saying
that one of them is a sub,'' Harris said. ``Then they don't feel
that they're taking a back seat to anybody, they just know every
third game it's their turn to come off the bench. I've thought
about that. I might do it. I don't know. I have to talk to those
players about that, if they're comfortable with something like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar situation is brewing at the power-forward slot, where
the Lakers _ who fell short in obtaining a top-flight starter _
could rotate Robert Horry, Travis Knight, Corie Blount and Elden
Campbell, perhaps even Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Horry, a converted small forward, started most of last season at
power forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely, out of those four guys, all of whom are good players,
we ought to be able to come up with an answer at the position every
night,'' Harris said. ``It might be different people on different
nights.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Aye-aye, cap'n: The Lakers coaching staff named O'Neal and
Derek Harper co-captains for the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, the sole captain last year and a co-captain his first
year here, was a natural. But Harper was a more unusual choice _
he's been a Laker for four days.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a sort of rare,'' acknowledged Harper, who earned the
title on the strength of his 15 years in the NBA. ``I feel
comfortable with the role, though. . . . I've been captain a lot of
times in my career. It's good to have a little youth and experience
as co-captains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll mean that I have to set the right example. It means that
you're looked up to for leadership more than anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said the coaches' selection of Harper as co-captain makes
a lot of sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they really feel like because of our youth, sometimes
it gets hard for guys that are at the same age and at the same
level to pull each other's chain. And a guy like Shaq, who is
physically overpowering and a dominating personality, it's easy for
him to say things,'' Fisher said. ``With `D' Harper, if he says
something, that's etched in stone because of the years he has in
the league and his experience. I think those were excellent
choices, and I think everyone else on the team felt that.''
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake _ this is still Shaq's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it is,'' Harper said, laughing. ``He and Dr. Buss.
No doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Ouch report: Ruben Patterson, who suffered a left-thigh
bruise Saturday, practiced Sunday. . . . Fisher suffered a
right-ankle sprain but said he'll practice today. . . . O'Neal
walked off the floor at one point Sunday night, his hand on his
abdomen, but returned a short time later and appeared to play
without pain. He said he did not reinjure the abdominal muscle that
sidelined him 22 games last season.

GLOBES FOR `SHAKESPEARE' AND `RYAN' 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS _ The Golden Globe award for best motion picture
musical or comedy was presented here on Sunday night to
``Shakespeare in Love,'' a whimsical imagining of how the
playwright found his inspiration for ``Romeo and Juliet.'' The
movie also took the award for best screenplay, which was written by
Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard.
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Globe for best dramatic movie went to the World War
II drama ``Saving Private Ryan.'' The best director award went to
the director of ``Private Ryan,'' Steven Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   The award for best actress in a drama went to Cate Blanchett for
her depiction of the British monarch in ``Elizabeth.'' The Globe
for best actor in a drama went to Jim Carrey for his role as the
unwitting star of a television show in the film ``The Truman
Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Caine took the Golden Globe as best actor in a musical
comedy for his role as the slick, small-town booking agent, Ray
Say, in the movie ``Little Voice.'' Gwyneth Paltrow took the award
as best actress in a motion picture musical or comedy for her part
as Shakespeare's muse in ``Shakespeare in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to take every role that came in'' and made a lot of
trash, Caine said. ``And a lot of money. So now I have enough money
to be artistic and wait, which is what I did for this film.'' Lynn
Redgrave won the Globe for best supporting actress in a movie for
her role as a devoted and protective maid in ``Gods and Monsters,''
while Ed Harris, who appeared as a Godlike, if slightly demonic
television producer in ``The Truman Show,'' took the award as best
supporting actor.
</P>
<P>
   On the television side of the awards, ``Ally McBeal'' won the
Globe in the category of best comedy or musical series. The best
drama award went to ``The Practice.'' Those awards presented an
extraordinary double for David E. Kelley, who is the creator and
executive producer of both shows, which are broadcast on Fox and
ABC, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Fox took the honor as best actor in a comedy series
for his role as an eager mayoral aide in ``Spin City,'' and Jenna
Elfman, who plays the loopy Dharma in ``Dharma and Greg,'' won as
best actress in a comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicholson was presented with the Cecil B. De Mille Award
for lifetime achievement.
</P>
<P>
   One of the surprises of the evening was the presentation of the
Globe for best actress in a television drama, which went to the
22-year-old Keri Russell, who stars in the first-year show
``Felicity.'' Dylan McDermott, the star of ``The Practice,'' won
the award for best actor in a drama.
</P>
<P>
   In the mini-series or television movie category, Angelina Jolie
took the Globe as best actress for her part as the tragic fashion
model Gia in the HBO film ``Gia.'' The best actor award in the
category went to Stanley Tucci, who played the gossip columnist in
``Winchell.''
</P>
<P>
   Camryn Manheim added one of the first amusing and unexpected
notes of the evening when she was awarded the Globe as best
supporting actress in a series, ``The Practice.'' In accepting the
award, for which she tied with Faye Dunaway, who was in ``Gia,''
she thanked friends and supporters, then added, ``I would like to
devote this to every single senator who votes to dismiss the case
tomorrow,'' referring to the impeachment process against President
Clinton in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The award for best mini-series or movie for television went to
``From the Earth to the Moon,'' the 12-hour program with Tom Hanks
as an executive producer; it previously won an Emmy.
</P>
<P>
   The 56th annual Golden Globes award ceremony was held as usual
here at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. The awards are noteworthy within
Hollywood partly because they are seen as a harbinger of the
Oscars, presented by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences this spring. Winning a Golden Globe is no guarantee of an
Oscar, but it is regarded as an indication of a sense of the tastes
in this town.
</P>
<P>
   The awards are also enjoyed in particular by the Hollywood
community because they offer one of the better parties of the year.
``It is really a party and we enjoy it,'' said Ms. Dunaway. Unlike
the Oscars and the Emmys, which take place in theaters, the Golden
Globes are presented in a nightclublike setting where alcohol is
served, loosening up the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The awards are somewhat of an oddity, though, because the
organization that sponsors them, the Hollywood Foreign Press
Association, is little known and wields scant influence outside of
the awards. The organization consists of 87 members, some of whom
are part-time journalists for publications rarely seen here.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the event has become a television spectacle as
well, watched by several hundred million people around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Producers at NBC, which owns the rights to televise the event,
said they enjoyed strong ratings in largely because it does present
such a relaxed spectacle, where the celebrities often dish out
surprises. For instance, last year, Christine Lahti was in the
ladies room when it was announced that she had won as best actress
in a drama.

ELWAY MUST PASS MUSTER 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL McDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Maybe John Elway has to get to the East Coast to get his
groove back.
</P>
<P>
   Although Elway will go down as one of the best passers ever to
play the game and is a cinch for the Hall of Fame, Super Bowls have
not been his thing.
</P>
<P>
   Elway has been in a funk when it comes to the greatest challenge
in pro football, and his performances definitely flunk when
compared with his marvelous regular-season numbers.
</P>
<P>
   If you are pulling for Denver in Sunday's game against Atlanta,
you have to be concerned about how Elway will play in what almost
everyone believes will be the last game of his career.
</P>
<P>
   In his four previous Super Bowls, he has performed far below his
norm. And in his last six postseason games he has not been sharp,
even though Denver has won every one.
</P>
<P>
   ``He simply can't throw it like he used to,'' said one coach who
faced Denver in the playoffs this year, ``and he can't move like he
used to either. But he's still dangerous. Every once in a while, he
looks like he used to in the old days, but not as often.''
</P>
<P>
   In his four Super Bowls, Elway has completed just 58 passes in
123 attempts, with only two touchdowns and seven interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   This flies in the face of everything he has done in the regular
season during his glittering career, in which he has been a 57
percent passer (compared with 47 percent in Super Bowls) and has
thrown 300 touchdowns against 226 interceptions. Better than a
touchdown a game in the regular season, just one touchdown every
two Super Bowls. Less than an interception per game in the regular
season (232 games), almost two per game in Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as troubling to Broncos followers is the way Elway has
thrown the ball in the last two postseasons. He was a miserable 13
of 34 against the Jets when the Broncos won the AFC title eight
days ago and had just 43 yards passing three minutes into the third
quarter, when Victor Green blew coverage on Ed McCaffrey, leaving
the Bronco wide open for a 47-yard grab. Elway threw for just 173
yards for the game, well below the acceptable level in the NFL. He
had several passes batted away before they crossed the line of
scrimmage, and when he was forced to throw on the run, which he has
done so impressively in the past, he did not have the speed or arm
strength to do it well.
</P>
<P>
   In the regular season, Elway has averaged just less than 222
yards per game in the air. In his last five postseason games he has
thrown for an average of just 171 yards, and in his last two Super
Bowls (108 vs. San Francisco and 123 vs. Green Bay) he has averaged
only 115 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, those are not close to being the worst
performances by a quarterback in a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' Tony Eason gets that prize. He had no completions
in six attempts, with two fumbles, against the Bears in Super Bowl
XX. But in fairness to Eason, his offensive line was overrun that
day, the Bears putting on maybe the best performance ever by a
defense in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   For two games, former Bronco and Cowboy Craig Morton has the
crown.
</P>
<P>
   In Super Bowl V, playing for Dallas vs. Baltimore, Morton
completed 12 of 26 passes for 127 yards with three interceptions.
Playing for Denver vs. Dallas in Super Bowl XII, Morton had four
completions in 15 attempts for 39 yards, with four interceptions.
So in two games he threw for 166 yards on 41 throws, with seven
interceptions and no touchdowns. That is unmatched.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not the lowest two-game passing total. Bob Griese of
the Dolphins has that, and his team won both games. In Super Bowl
VII, when the Dolphins were finishing off their sensational
undefeated season, Griese threw only 11 times vs. Washington,
completing eight for just 88 yards. A year later, vs. Minnesota, he
threw just seven passes, with six completions for 73 yards. Miami
won both games with the power running of Larry Csonka and great
defense, the D giving up only one touchdown in two games.
</P>
<P>
   So the burden will be on Elway Sunday, one way or another.
</P>
<P>
   If he loses, he will match Jim Kelly of Buffalo as only the
second quarterback to lose four Super Bowl games. If he wins, he
can join Bart Starr, Griese, Terry Bradshaw, Troy Aikman, and Joe
Montana as QBs who won them back to back.

 GAME-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   TAMPA _ As expected, Sunday's All-Star Game here was a showcase
for the National Hockey League's most skilled athletes. What was
perhaps not expected was just how much of a showcase it was for the
veteran set.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers center Wayne Gretzky, playing his 20th season, turned in
a spectacular performance in leading the North Americans over the
World team, 8-6. It was the second year of the new format and the
second year the North Americans skated away with the win.
</P>
<P>
   As little as this contest ever resembles a real game, what made
Sunday's special was the realization players the caliber of Gretzky
and Bruins captain Ray Bourque, appearing in his 17th All-Star
Game, are winding down.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky had a goal and two assists, Bourque had a goal, and
Dallas's Mike Modano had a goal and three assists. Mats Sundin had
a goal and three assists for the World team and Bruins right wing
Dmitri Khristich picked up an assist.
</P>
<P>
   The North Americans scored first, at 4:09 of the opening period,
when Modano connected. Marco Sturm tied it at 9:42, but the next
five goals were by the North Americans and they cruised to the win.
</P>
<P>
   The most dazzling line was Gretzky, Mark Recchi, and Theo
Fleury, a combination put together by coach Ken Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw three smart hockey players,'' said Hitchcock. ``You kind
of dream about putting three smart hockey players together, the
same thing we did with (Tony) Amonte, Modano, and (Paul) Kariya.
And we just felt like if the line had some type of chemistry,
through speed or smarts or strength, these guys might have some fun
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, at 38, said he had a terrific time not only playing
with but watching Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun tonight,'' said Bourque, ``seeing the way Wayne
went out, same old guy. It's great to see a 37- or 38-year-old
20-year vet go out and play like that because he's got a love for
the game, he's got a passion. We approach the game in the same way
and he went out and put on another show. I'll remember this game
because it was great to see him out there. It was so exciting.
Wayne has been around so long, he's the greatest. He put on a
performance tonight and it was a great time to do it in front of
the whole hockey world.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque scored his goal at the 17-second mark of the second
period on goalie Arturs Irbe, which gave the North Americans a 5-1
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you pick up a goal in these types of games, it's a
big bonus,'' he said. ``Being here is an honor and a privilege.
When you're able to score a goal or be part of the game, it's a
bonus and it was fun to be part of the scoring. I had a great time
doing it, I had a blast. Sometimes you shake your head and you say
it's been a while and it's still going and you're going to ride the
wave until it comes down. Hopefully when that time comes, I'll be
walking out before it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   As much fun as it was to play a different style of game, run and
gun instead of grinding it out as he does with the Bruins every
night, Bourque said he enjoyed surveying all the top talent in the
league as he sat between shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is scary to look at the skill out there,'' he said.
``When you're a player and you're watching it from the bench, it's
a phenomenal talent level. Thank God I got by without getting a
goal scored against me and that's maybe a first. It's a different
game. I'm not used to playing that type of hockey. It's different,
it's nice. It's fun to show that we can still compete at our age
and at this time of our career.''

IOC SEEKS TO OUST SIX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ The embattled International Olympic
Committee moved decisively Sunday to purge itself and radically
reform the bidding process for future host cities amid the worst
scandal in its 105 years.
</P>
<P>
   Besides recommending expulsion for six members who took payoffs
and gifts from the Salt Lake City organizers for the 2002 Winter
Games, the IOC's executive board:
</P>
<P>
   --Forbade IOC members to visit or accept visits from any of the
six European cities bidding for the 2006 Winter Games;
</P>
<P>
   --Created a 15-member election committee, only nine of them IOC
members, to choose the 2006 site in June;
</P>
<P>
   --Resolved to continue investigating inappropriate conduct
involving Games from 1996-2006;
</P>
<P>
   --Decided to establish an ethics commission with a majority of
outside members;
</P>
<P>
   --Reaffirmed Sydney and Salt Lake City as the 2000 and 2002
sites;
</P>
<P>
   --Gave IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, who vowed to stay
on until his term ends in 2001, a unanimous vote of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would again like to extend my personal apology to the
Olympic family for the troubling concerns that have surfaced in the
last few months,'' added Samaranch. ``It should not have happened.
I am sorry. I hope the decisions we made today will demonstrate our
resolve to never let this happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   The 78-year-old Samaranch, who has been president since 1980,
said he would ask his colleagues to reaffirm their support for him
at the IOC's special session here in March.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the fourteen members implicated in the Salt Lake scandal
have either quit or likely will be expelled in March if they do not
step down. Pirjo Haeggman of Finland and Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi
of Libya resigned last week and David Sikhulumi Sibandze of
Swaziland followed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The other six _ Agustin Arroyo of Ecuador, Jean-Claude Ganga of
the Republic of Congo, Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir of Sudan,
Lamine Keita of Mali, Charles Nderitu Mukora of Kenya, and Sergio
Santander Fantini of Chile _ have been excluded from the IOC,
pending expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tender your resignations,'' Samaranch urged them. ``Do not
wait to be expelled by the session. Put an end to this ugly chapter
in the history of the Olympic Games.''
</P>
<P>
   Six of the members, whom the IOC did not identify, defended
themselves in person at committee headquarters here Saturday. The
others responded by letter.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has not expelled a member since Saul Cristavao Ferreira
Pires of Portugal was banished in 1962 for not paying his hotel
bill at the 1960 Summer Games in Rome. A two-thirds vote is
necessary for expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will be expelled,'' predicted vice president Anita
DeFrantz of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   If the inquiry panel finds more evidence of wrongdoing by
members involving other bid cities from other years, the IOC vowed
to expel them as well. ``If facts are brought to us,'' Samaranch
said, ``we will continue to put order in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Three other members _ executive board member Kim Un-Yong of
South Korea, former vice president Vitaly Smirnov of Russia, and
Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye of the Ivory Coast _ are still under
investigation. Anton Geesink of the Netherlands was let off with a
warning after it was concluded he was unaware that a $5,000
donation to a foundation in his name was made by the Salt Lake
committee. Rene Essomba of Cameroon, whose daughter received
tuition payments to American University, died last year.
</P>
<P>
   The members involved, who accepted nearly $800,000 in cash and
gifts before and after the Utah capital won the Games four years
ago, were not accused of corruption, bribery or other criminal
conduct by the executive board.
</P>
<P>
   ``These individuals are guilty of breaking the oath they took
when they were inducted as members of the IOC and for bringing the
reputation of the IOC into disrepute,'' said vice president Richard
Pound of Canada, who chaired the inquiry panel.
</P>
<P>
   Though eight of the 14 implicated members are African (more than
a third of the continent's membership), the IOC denied that the
issue had racial overtones.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an issue of geography, culture, or race and should
not be perceived that way,'' said Pound. ``It is a matter of
individual conduct in an organization that places the highest
importance on its members' personal integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the scandal grew out of a bidding process that induced
cities to spend millions of dollars wooing, and apparently bribing,
voters, the IOC has resolved to take away its 114 members' most
cherished privilege _ choosing the sites of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the members would pick eight of their colleagues, who
will be joined by three athletes, a representative from both the
Association of National Olympic Committees and the International
Winter Sports Federations, the chairman of the IOC's site
evaluation commission (Chiharu Igaya of Japan), and the IOC's
longest-serving member (Joao Havelange of Brazil). None of the IOC
representatives can be a member of the executive board or site
evaluation commission or come from bidding countries. Samaranch
will chair the election committee, but will not vote.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the IOC members would have to approve the change,
but DeFrantz predicted they would. ``I think the members who care
about the Olympic movement will do this gladly,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC did not say whether the election committee will visit
the 2006 candidate cities (Sion, Switzerland; Turin, Italy;
Helsinki; Klagenfurt, Austria; Zakopane, Poland; Poprad-Tatry,
Slovakia), but its site evaluation committee already has presented
a detailed technical report on each bidder.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the IOC is asking all bid committees for the 1996
Summer, 1998 Winter, 2000 Summer, 2002 Winter, 2004 Summer, and
2006 Winter Games for any further evidence of inappropriate conduct
by IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   IOC executive board member Jacques Rogge of Belgium, who heads
the coordination commission for the 2000 Games, will go to
Australia next month to investigate alleged improprieties involving
the Sydney bid. Since Atlanta's 1996 committee is virtually defunct
and Nagano's 1998 committee burned its books, the IOC will query
the US and Japanese Olympic Committees.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent future wrongdoing by its members, the IOC will
establish a permanent commission to draw up a code of ethics and
investigate alleged improprieties. One of its first tasks will be
to complete the probe of Kim, Smirnov, and Guirandou-N'Diaye.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are resolute in our determination to root out the
improprieties and to ensure that this never happens again,'' said
Samaranch. ``This is the beginning, not the end, of our work.''

BC MEN CAN'T REPEAT FEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Deep down, every member of the Boston College men's
basketball team who attended the women's squad's upset over
second-ranked Connecticut Saturday coveted the chance to experience
the same euphoria. They wanted to know what it would feel like to
celebrate a Big East victory over a ranked opponent before a
capacity Conte Forum crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we want as a team,'' said junior guard Dwayne
Pina. ``We want 8,000 people in the stands, screaming for us.''
</P>
<P>
   So what happened Sunday when the men took the floor against No.
25 Miami?
</P>
<P>
   The roof at Conte Forum sprung a leak during warmups, causing a
10-minute delay. Then, after battling back from a pair of 15-point
deficits to pull within 37-33 at halftime, the roof seemed to
collapse altogether on the Eagles after they took a 40-39 lead.
</P>
<P>
   BC suffered its eighth loss in a row, and 12th in its last 13
games, in a 75-67 setback to the Hurricanes before a crowd of 4,251
who enjoyed a halftime ceremony to retire the jerseys of John Silk
(1949-53), Terry Driscoll (1966-69), and Michael Adams (1981-85).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're continually putting ourselves into a hole and fighting
to get back,'' said BC coach Al Skinner, whose team dropped to 3-14
overall and 0-9 in the conference. ``We worked so hard to get back
into the game, and I'm happy about that, but we've just got to get
off to a better start to give ourselves a chance throughout 40
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Pina led the Eagles by scoring a career-high 17 points _ more
than doubling his personal best of 8 _ while sophomore Kenny Harley
had 16 points and six rebounds. Freshman forward Kenny Walls came
off the bench to chip in 14 points, and junior forward Michael
Cotton added 13 points and a team-high seven rebounds to help BC
outboard the Hurricanes, 32-28.
</P>
<P>
   Junior swingman Johnny Hemsley led Miami (12-4, 6-2) with 21
points while silky senior forward Tim James had 16 points and eight
rebounds and burly junior center Mario Bland 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not real sure that the team that really wanted the game
most won the game,'' said Miami coach Leonard Hamilton. ``The story
today is not the fact we won the game, but the effort that Boston
College gave.''
</P>
<P>
   After suffering a 39-point thrashing at Syracuse Thursday night,
BC's worst conference loss and the third-most lopsided game in
league history, the Eagles appeared, as Skinner said, ``to show
some residue from that game early on.'' BC trailed, 28-13 and
30-15, in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   But Hamilton, who coached the Hurricanes to an 0-18 conference
record in the 1993-94 season, lavishly praised Skinner and the
Eagles for ``absolutely refusing to quit. There were times during
the game where I thought they were tired. I thought we had them on
the ropes, but they kept fighting back.''
</P>
<P>
   After missing its first six 3-pointers, BC made six of eight in
the last 5:50 of the first half, including five in a row to fuel a
15-3 run that pulled the Eagles within 33-30 with 3:16 to go. After
Miami surged to a 37-30 lead, Brian Ross struck for a trey that
bounced high over the rim and fell through to bring BC within 4 at
intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Harley gave BC its only lead, 40-39, on a pull-up lane jumper
with 15:20 to go, but the Eagles committed two turnovers in
enabling Miami to push it to 46-40. The Eagles got no closer than 6
thereafter, with Pina hitting a trey to make it 64-58.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they keep playing like that, they're going to beat somebody
in this league and they probably won't have a chance to tie my
record of 0-18, but I've been there,'' Hamilton said. ``You have no
idea what it takes to motivate your kids night in and night out
when you're faced with that type of adversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I used to shed tears, try to get quotes out of the
Bible, read all kinds of motivational books to try and find some
way to motivate our kids,'' he added. ``Whatever Coach Skinner is
doing, he keeps those kids playing like they believe that there's a
purpose, and that's to get better every night. I take my hat off to
him.''

SONICS SOLD ON STEPANIA'S POWER POTENTIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ He has been here a week, and Sonic center Vladimir
Stepania's only impression of Seattle is the Space Needle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's special. But nothing special,'' the Slovenian rookie said
with a wide grin and a limited English vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's big,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   And after four days of Sonics training camp, the perception of
Stepania is about the same.
</P>
<P>
   He is special considering his array of offensive skills that
prompted the Sonics' long, hard fight to buy out Stepania's
European contract. Yet he is not that special considering his Space
Needle-shaped body.
</P>
<P>
   But Stepania is tall, and that makes him all the more
intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a 7-foot, 240-pound center flinging legitimate
3-pointers, dishing off no-look passes and handling the basketball
with the skill of a guard dodging traffic.
</P>
<P>
   This is Seattle's foreign phenom whose only drawback is that he
needs to fill out.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this moment,'' began Stepania as he does most of his
sentences, ``I'm not prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   While practices have shown Stepania is not strong enough to
handle the backup center role as originally expected, he should
contribute in some capacity.
</P>
<P>
   When Stepania faces the basket, he can dribble with either hand
and shoot a mid-range jump shot. He also is a good passer who can
use a number of moves to get a shot off under the basket.
</P>
<P>
   But he already has gotten pushed around quite often.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah,'' starting center Olden Polynice said. ``We've seen a
lot of those (European) guys. But he has the capability of being a
very good player. It's surprising to see a guy that big handling
the ball and shooting outside jumpers. He's more of a finesse
player. We're trying to get him to be more physical.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Aaron Williams, who will back up Polynice: ``I think he
already notices that it's a lot rougher over here. He's not getting
a lot of the calls that he would get over in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   What Stepania lacks in size, he makes up for with sheer guts.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of training camp, second-round draft choice
Jelani McCoy whirled on Stepania and stuffed the ball through the
rim so hard everyone in the gym screeched simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   However, Stepania drew the same reaction Sunday when he
virtually executed the same move while 6-foot-10 Detlef Schrempf
guarded him. After the rookie whirled and threw down a left-handed
dunk, he looked for a high-five from Schrempf.
</P>
<P>
   What Stepania got instead was a shove in the chest from the
veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hard time because I'm rookie on good team,'' Stepania
said. ``Practice is very different game. It's more tough physical
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Sonics coach Paul Westphal feels Stepania just needs to learn
the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not as lost today as he was yesterday. But he's still
deep in the woods,'' Westphal said. ``... He's got to get stronger
to be able to hold his position when he plays in the post. He does
some good things. He's got some real ability. He has to play to his
ability, though. When he learns what his advantages are and how to
hide his disadvantages, he'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   It took about two weeks after a new NBA collective bargaining
agreement was struck and a little drama before Stepania became
free. Negotiations seesawed before the Sonics bought out the final
year of Stepania's contract with $250,000, according to his
attorney Scott Boatman.A
</P>
<P>
   The payment was the most allowable by the NBA before money
counted against the Sonics' salary cap. Stepania finally signed a
three-year deal worth $1.71 million with the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about him is he is aggressive,'' forward Vin
Baker said. ``You can tell he really wants to play against NBA
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Stepania has seen nothing outside of his hotel room and
the practice facility. He said the NBA, not sightseeing, is what
coming to America is about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping to come here because I'm only 22,'' Stepania
said. ``I wanted to test myself in NBA. It's the best. Europe is
high right now. But at this moment, it does not look like NBA. The
NBA is big.''
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Point guard Moochie Norris is performing so well in camp
that he might have locked up the backup role. Said Westphal: ``I
don't see any reason why he's not an NBA player. He's done a real
fine job. ... I'm real glad we have him.''

LADY ROMPS TO WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM BARRERO  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ Through the years, jockey Kent Desormeaux has
become somewhat numb to many of the everyday thrills of horse
racing.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a lot for the 29-year-old, who has been a Santa Anita
mainstay most of this decade, to get excited.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday, in the Grade II $103,292 Santa Ynez Stakes,
Desormeaux experienced one of those days that leaves him shaking
his head.
</P>
<P>
   Desormeaux, riding Honest Lady in only her second career start
after an impressive maiden victory, steered the 3-year-old filly to
victory as the second choice in a four-horse field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you,'' Desormeaux said, ``it takes Derbies and races
like that now to raise the hair on my back, but she just raised the
hair on my back.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is how nasty she is.''
</P>
<P>
   Honest Lady's winning time of 1:21.67 was the third-fastest in
the 48-year history of the race. Only Terlingua (1:21 1/5 in 1979)
and Serena's Song (1:21.45 in 1995) ran faster.
</P>
<P>
   Honest Lady, a daughter of Seattle Slew and Grade I winner
Toussand and owned by Kentucky's Juddmonte Farms, overcame a poor
start and tracked 6-5 favorite Controlled to the far turn. There,
she took command and drew off to win convincingly under a hand
ride.
</P>
<P>
   Rayelle, with Emile Ramsammy aboard, rallied for second, two
lengths ahead of Controlled. Another length back was Perfect Six.
</P>
<P>
   With no show wagering, Honest Lady, at 17-10 odds, paid $5.40
and $4.60. Rayelle returned $4.80 to place.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Frankel, who has trained Eclipse Award-winning fillies
Possibly Perfect ('95), Wandesta ('96) and Ryafan ('97), also had
high praise for Honest Lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the best 2-year-old filly I've trained, by far,''
Frankel said. ``She's so talented, it's unreal. I think she's a
superstar.''
</P>
<P>
   Desormeaux said he didn't even have to prod Honest Lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Controlled) really took off at the three-eighths pole, and
this filly, without being asked, just loomed up boldly and just
blew past,'' Desormeaux said. ``I mean, everything comes so easy to
this filly that I think she's just bored out there. She is
obviously very, very special.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankel _ who won the 1998 Kentucky Oaks, the nation's top race
for 3-year-old fillies, with Keeper Hill _ indicated the Grade I,
$200,000 Las Virgenes Stakes on Feb. 13 is likely the next
challenge for Honest Lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knock on wood, if she stays sound _ she's very sound _ I can
have a career,'' Frankel said. ``Sometimes when they run so fast,
they get hurt. Kent protected her today.''
</P>
<P>
   Pick Six wagering was feverish Sunday with a $485,000 carryover
into Sunday. Ultimately, there were six tickets with all six
winners, paying $244,702.60 apiece.

LEGACY AT STAKE FOR U.S. WOMEN IN WORLD CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ An hour before members of the U.S. women's
soccer team were due back to training camp Sunday, coach Tony
DiCicco had made up his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Practice would be a series of scrimmages. A round robin of
6-on-6 mini-games topped with a 20-minute, full-field match that in
case of a tie would be decided by penalty kicks.
</P>
<P>
   The point was, somebody was going to win. The coach knew that
after a three-day break this would be just the thing to get his
players' competitive juices flowing _ as if this team needed any
extra goading.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to like this,'' assistant coach Lauren Gregg
said, smiling. ``It's going to be a bloodbath.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to their world.
</P>
<P>
   And welcome to the 1999 Women's World Cup, a 16-country, 32-game
draw to be played June 19 though July 10 at the biggest venues
across America. So far, more than 200,000 tickets have been sold.
</P>
<P>
   For the U.S. women, World Cup fever already has started, since
the national team is taking the next five months to make sure it
does nothing less than win the whole damn thing.
</P>
<P>
   You don't win a decade's worth of World Cups, Olympics, Goodwill
Games and every other imaginable soccer title _ including the
unofficial moniker of greatest women's soccer team ever _ without
some hint of killer instinct.
</P>
<P>
   The women were more than happy to demonstrate that much Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   By dusk at the Seminole County Training Facility, the women's
training center this winter and spring, bodies were strewn across
the putting-green perfect soccer pitch like a re-enactment of the
Battle of Gettysburg.
</P>
<P>
   Star forward Mia Hamm's toe had been trampled and mangled so
badly she was relegated to calling offsides.
</P>
<P>
   Midfielder Tiffany Roberts, out of the University of North
Carolina soccer factory for national level players, finally
submitted to an ice pack for an ankle sprain that would have put
most NBA players on the injured reserve list for a week.
</P>
<P>
   But Shannon MacMillan, the former Portland standout whose goals
helped the U.S. win the 1996 Olympic gold medal, kept playing
despite a flower of blood blossoming through the tape and white
sock on the inside of her ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all right,'' MacMillan said, jogging off the injury and
looking for another long ball to come her way. ``I've just got a
hole in my foot.''
</P>
<P>
   If they were making a movie about this squad, they would call it
``Tough and Tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're pulling me out after only seven minutes?'' Michelle
Akers asked when a substitute was sent in for her during the
full-field scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   Akers, a Seattle-area product from Shoreline who will turn 33
next week, is the oldest member of the team. She has also battled
chronic fatigue syndrome over the past six years, although she said
she is feeling the best she has since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the veteran did not seem to immediately appreciate the
fact that her coaches were just trying to do her a favor by giving
Akers a breather.
</P>
<P>
   Other than those painful moments, the women were lucky it was
only about 70 degrees and the air was without a trace of that
notorious Florida humidity. DiCicco picked this secluded inland
training spot in part because the women trained here so
successfully for the '96 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   By March and April, the air here will grow as heavy and stifling
as a sponge _ a training condition DiCicco knows will best prepare
the women for whatever is doled out in Washington, D.C., Chicago or
Pasadena, Calif., this World Cup summer.
</P>
<P>
   A huge part of the motivation for this team is that after
winning the first Women's World Cup in '91, they lost in '95,
finishing third.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an ache there, not being the world champions,''
midfielder Julie Foudy said. ``We left that (second) Cup sitting
there in Norway.''
</P>
<P>
   For a team as successful as this one, it is hard to imagine they
have any sense of disappointment. But that is why this group is so
unusually motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an opportunity for us to put any doubt aside about which
team is the greatest women's team ever,'' DiCicco said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there any doubt?'' Akers said. ``I think we've already done
that.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean Akers and Co. will settle for anything less
than winning it all, which explains all the blood spilled on the
battlefield.

TRACK/FOOTBALL STANDOUT PICKS USC
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC received an oral commitment Sunday from wide
receiver Marcell Allmond of St. Paul High, considered one of the
top athletes in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Allmond, who could also play cornerback or safety in college, is
considered one of the top track prospects in the country. He is the
defending state champion in the 110-meter hurdles (13.8 seconds)
and is considered perhaps the No.1 junior performer in the
decathlon.
</P>
<P>
   Allmond (6-foot-3, 195 pounds) has made several football
recruiting services' All-American teams. USC's football recruiting
class is providing a boost for the track program, with the Trojans
receiving commitments from the state champion in the 100 meters
(Darrell Rideaux of Long Beach Poly), 200 meters (Kareem Kelly of
Long Beach Poly) and 110 hurdles (Allmond).

`RYAN,' `SHAKESPEARE' CAPTURE TOP PRIZES AT GOLDEN GLOBES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- ``Shakespeare'' was loved, Jack
Nicholson was roasted and ``Saving Private Ryan'' started its march
toward the Oscars at the 56th annual Golden Globe Awards presented
by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association Sunday night at the
Beverly Hilton Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   On the television side, producer David E. Kelley got a double
dose of honors and ``Felicity's'' Keri Russell was an upset winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan'' took home two awards -- best motion picture drama and
for Steven Spielberg's direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love'' won for movie (comedy or musical),
screenplay and actress Gwyneth Paltrow's performance. ``The Truman
Show'' was also a big winner, taking home prizes for motion picture
score and for the work of actors Jim Carrey and Ed Harris.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is serious,'' Carrey said, looking at his award. ``It's
going to be so hard to talk out of my ass after this -- but I'll
manage.'' Carrey said he was going to give his award to his
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Cate Blanchett won best dramatic actress for her role as the
title character in ``Elizabeth.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the awards were spread among several movies --
including an award for Michael Caine as best comedic actor in
``Little Voice'' -- could make for a more wide-open Oscar race, as
the Globes often foreshadow the Academy Awards. With its two major
honors, though, Spielberg's World War II drama remains the
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg, who relaxed Sunday by watching ``Gunfight at the OK
Corral'' with Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas, said about Ryan, ``I
hope that the movie is looking back 54 years to our fathers and
grandfathers to say thank you for letting us live in the free world
that we do.''
</P>
<P>
   A friend of President Clinton, he was asked how he would film
the impeachment. ``I wouldn't,'' Spielberg said. ``Like so many
other Americans I got tired of that story seven month ago.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the subject of his friend George Lucas' upcoming ``Star
Wars'' prequel, ``The Phantom Menace,'' Speilberg was more
enthusiastic, saying he has seen it.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, ``I looked at George and said, Oooh, my God.''
</P>
<P>
   The evening's highlight came when Warren Beatty presented
Nicholson with the Cecil B. DeMille Lifetime Achievement Award, an
honor Nicholson later said gave him ``the fear of the shroud.''
Beatty jokingly called Nicholson ``one of my childhood idols'' and
a later a ``contemporary of Cecil B. DeMille.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson took it all in good humor and delivered a long,
rambling, deliciously funny acceptance speech that touched on all
aspects of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I like about this achievement award is that it doesn't
come from my peers,'' Nicholson said, flashing his trademark grin.
``The Hollywood Foreign Press Association is a loose group of guys
and gals. You almost feel like you could go out and have fun with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the major television categories, ``Ally McBeal'' was again
named best comedy series, while ``The Practice'' won for best
drama. Both series are produced by Kelley. Tom Hanks' celebrated
HBO miniseries about NASA's Apollo missions, ``From the Earth to
the Moon,'' won the prize for best miniseries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to salute the men from the Apollo era,'' Hanks said,
``for tolerating our hubris at capturing their story in 12 hours
when we really needed 120.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Fox of ``Spin City'' was the winner for TV comedy
actor. The star, who has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease,
thanked his doctors, including one he said had opened up his brain.
``We're so lucky to do what we do . . . and just take every day and
enjoy it,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   And say what you will about the Golden Globes -- that its voting
members are known more for their fondness of food than their
knowledge of television and movies, that one of its members writes
for a French monthly called ``Girls,'' that they once gave an award
to Zsa Zsa Gabor.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing you can't accuse them of is predictability or
stodginess. Russell of the critically acclaimed WB youth drama
``Felicity'' would never be nominated for an Emmy, much less win
one for best dramatic actress. But Sunday night, she was the
surprised winner of a Golden Globe, beating such top actresses as
Gillian Anderson of ``The X-Files,'' Kim Delaney of ``NYPD Blue,''
Roma Downey of ``Touched by an Angel'' and Julianna Margulies of
``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(`Felicity' is) a great show; I'm glad they take us seriously,
too,'' said Russell, dressed in Armani ``hippie chic.''
</P>
<P>
   The Globes, of course, don't take themselves all that seriously,
which makes it the loosest of awards shows. The fact that the
ceremony follows a dinner lubricated with an abundance of alcohol
certainly plays a part in the boisterous spirit and unguarded
moments the show always produces.
</P>
<P>
   Examples: Ed Harris, supporting actor winner for his work in
``The Truman Show,'' arrived on stage picking his teeth, saying,
``I just got through with dinner.'' Last year's television dramatic
actress winner, Christine Lahti, arrived at the podium with toilet
paper trailing from her shoe, making light of the fact that she was
in the bathroom last year when her name was announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the greatest party,'' said ``Dharma and Greg's'' Jenna
Elfman, winner for best comedy actress. When asked what she was
going to do next, Elfman replied, ``Why, go back in and drink some
more champagne, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   Camryn Manheim, following her Emmy win for ``The Practice'' with
a Golden Globe, seemed to be on a high when she delivered one of
the most appreciated acceptance speeches of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to share this award with every single senator who
votes to dismiss the case (against President Clinton) tomorrow,''
Manheim said, punctuating it with ``Wooo-hooo!''
</P>
<P>
   To which her co-star and fellow Globe winner Dylan McDermott

   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- ``Shakespeare'' was loved, Jack
Nicholson was roasted and ``Saving Private Ryan'' started its march
toward the Oscars at the 56th annual Golden Globe Awards presented
by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association Sunday night at the
Beverly Hilton Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   On the television side, producer David E. Kelley got a double
dose of honors and ``Felicity's'' Keri Russell was an upset winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan'' took home two awards -- best motion picture drama and
for Steven Spielberg's direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love'' won for movie (comedy or musical),
screenplay and actress Gwyneth Paltrow's performance. ``The Truman
Show'' was also a big winner, taking home prizes for motion picture
score and for the work of actors Jim Carrey and Ed Harris.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is serious,'' Carrey said, looking at his award. ``It's
going to be so hard to talk out of my ass after this -- but I'll
manage.'' Carrey said he was going to give his award to his
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Cate Blanchett won best dramatic actress for her role as the
title character in ``Elizabeth.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the awards were spread among several movies --
including an award for Michael Caine as best comedic actor in
``Little Voice'' -- could make for a more wide-open Oscar race, as
the Globes often foreshadow the Academy Awards. With its two major
honors, though, Spielberg's World War II drama remains the
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg, who relaxed Sunday by watching ``Gunfight at the OK
Corral'' with Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas, said about Ryan, ``I
hope that the movie is looking back 54 years to our fathers and
grandfathers to say thank you for letting us live in the free world
that we do.''
</P>
<P>
   A friend of President Clinton, he was asked how he would film
the impeachment. ``I wouldn't,'' Spielberg said. ``Like so many
other Americans I got tired of that story seven month ago.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the subject of his friend George Lucas' upcoming ``Star
Wars'' prequel, ``The Phantom Menace,'' Speilberg was more
enthusiastic, saying he has seen it.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, ``I looked at George and said, Oooh, my God.''
</P>
<P>
   The evening's highlight came when Warren Beatty presented
Nicholson with the Cecil B. DeMille Lifetime Achievement Award, an
honor Nicholson later said gave him ``the fear of the shroud.''
Beatty jokingly called Nicholson ``one of my childhood idols'' and
a later a ``contemporary of Cecil B. DeMille.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson took it all in good humor and delivered a long,
rambling, deliciously funny acceptance speech that touched on all
aspects of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I like about this achievement award is that it doesn't
come from my peers,'' Nicholson said, flashing his trademark grin.
``The Hollywood Foreign Press Association is a loose group of guys
and gals. You almost feel like you could go out and have fun with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the major television categories, ``Ally McBeal'' was again
named best comedy series, while ``The Practice'' won for best
drama. Both series are produced by Kelley. Tom Hanks' celebrated
HBO miniseries about NASA's Apollo missions, ``From the Earth to
the Moon,'' won the prize for best miniseries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to salute the men from the Apollo era,'' Hanks said,
``for tolerating our hubris at capturing their story in 12 hours
when we really needed 120.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Fox of ``Spin City'' was the winner for TV comedy
actor. The star, who has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease,
thanked his doctors, including one he said had opened up his brain.
``We're so lucky to do what we do . . . and just take every day and
enjoy it,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   And say what you will about the Golden Globes -- that its voting
members are known more for their fondness of food than their
knowledge of television and movies, that one of its members writes
for a French monthly called ``Girls,'' that they once gave an award
to Zsa Zsa Gabor.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing you can't accuse them of is predictability or
stodginess. Russell of the critically acclaimed WB youth drama
``Felicity'' would never be nominated for an Emmy, much less win
one for best dramatic actress. But Sunday night, she was the
surprised winner of a Golden Globe, beating such top actresses as
Gillian Anderson of ``The X-Files,'' Kim Delaney of ``NYPD Blue,''
Roma Downey of ``Touched by an Angel'' and Julianna Margulies of
``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(`Felicity' is) a great show; I'm glad they take us seriously,
too,'' said Russell, dressed in Armani ``hippie chic.''
</P>
<P>
   The Globes, of course, don't take themselves all that seriously,
which makes it the loosest of awards shows. The fact that the
ceremony follows a dinner lubricated with an abundance of alcohol
certainly plays a part in the boisterous spirit and unguarded
moments the show always produces.
</P>
<P>
   Examples: Ed Harris, supporting actor winner for his work in
``The Truman Show,'' arrived on stage picking his teeth, saying,
``I just got through with dinner.'' Last year's television dramatic
actress winner, Christine Lahti, arrived at the podium with toilet
paper trailing from her shoe, making light of the fact that she was
in the bathroom last year when her name was announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the greatest party,'' said ``Dharma and Greg's'' Jenna
Elfman, winner for best comedy actress. When asked what she was
going to do next, Elfman replied, ``Why, go back in and drink some
more champagne, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   Camryn Manheim, following her Emmy win for ``The Practice'' with
a Golden Globe, seemed to be on a high when she delivered one of
the most appreciated acceptance speeches of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to share this award with every single senator who
votes to dismiss the case (against President Clinton) tomorrow,''
Manheim said, punctuating it with ``Wooo-hooo!''
</P>
<P>
   To which her co-star and fellow Globe winner Dylan McDermott
later said, ``What can I say that would be better than that? I'm
just going to go to New Orleans tomorrow to continue the party.''
The Hollywood Foreign Press Association would undoubtedly be proud.

<P>
   BOSTON _ Cathy Inglese, the Boston College women's basketball
coach, didn't have a lot of time to savor her team's stunning upset
Saturday of the University of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   After about 24 hours of phone calls from friends and coaches all
over the country, and doing interviews for radio and TV stations,
Inglese had to get back to work, preparing for six games over the
next three weeks, five on the road. And even though she was
exhilarated about the 78-66 win, she was exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great game but emotionally draining,'' Inglese said
Sundayfrom her office. She and her assistants were getting ready to
watch films of upcoming opponents, and of Saturday's victory to
critique it for the players.
</P>
<P>
   Inglese said she's determined that the team ``can use this as a
feel-good win,'' and relax before it faces three Top 15 teams,
Notre Dame, Rutgers, and UConn _ again. The Eagles had Sunday off
but will be back in the gym Monday getting ready for Wednesday's
game at Seton Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Last month's win against Notre Dame turned out to be an
indication to Inglese of just what the team could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was unbelievable, it was the first time in history that
we ever beat a Top 10,'' she said. ``So now we had to duplicate it,
and do it without Cal (Bouchard). That's where I think Brianne
(Stepherson) and Alissa (Murphy) really turned the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, who was filling in for the injured Bouchard at guard,
scored a career-high 32 points. Sharing the backcourt was
Stepherson, who had 8 points and five assists.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard, who was sidelined two weeks ago with an isolated
anterior cruciate ligament tear, should be able to join the team
when it faces UConn again Feb. 9, said Inglese. ``But I'd like to
get her back before then, and hope it's not her first day back,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the euphoria of the win was the fact that senior forward
Paula Bacso, who was slated to start, only saw nine minutes of
action. Inglese said Bacso had her foot X-rayed that morning for a
possible stress fracture.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's one of our best passers, but I just put her in there to
give the other players a breather,'' Inglese said. ``But she was
coming off of the court limping.''
</P>
<P>
   But the other players stepped up, even when the Huskies came
back from halftime with a 7-0 run that looked like it would get
UConn back in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't so much worried about losing as I was of UConn's
ability,'' she said. ``When I called a timeout my message was that
we can't let down, we can't turn the ball over and let them get
easy layups. That's where UConn could have come up with it, but we
made some gutsy moves.''
</P>
<P>
   Four UConn turnovers led to three straight BC baskets and the
lead soon grew back to 19. But UConn refused to go down easily, and
with the shooting of team-high scorer Tamika Williams (20), again
got the deficit to 9 with just more than a minute to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``UConn is so dominating like that and has that winning edge,''
Inglese said. ``That's what's so daunting, the last minute seemed
like 10.''
</P>
<P>
   The three freshmen who started _ Stepherson, Nicole Conway, and
Becky Gottstein _ contributed 33 points. UConn's three starting
freshmen had 21.
</P>
<P>
   While BC's freshman class (center Kim Mackie is the fourth), has
been largely unheralded, the UConn newcomers were dubbed the ``Fab
Five'' even before school began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I really believe UConn's freshmen are very good, and
they get a lot of attention because they were No. 1, but I think
ours are very good, too,'' Inglese said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if before the game she honestly believed the Eagles could
fend off the formidable Huskies, Inglese acknowledged that her
optimism was tempered with realism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that we had a chance to win, but UConn is powerful
and dangerous, and at their place it could be different,'' she
said. ``There was a small margin of error. I knew it was a long
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   A long shot, maybe, but one that paid off.

XXXIII numbers don't give answer
<TEXT>
<P>
   By DALE ROBERTSON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The last time the Denver Broncos found themselves
favored in a Super Bowl, they let Washington go five for five in
the second quarter. That's as in five possessions and five
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   They lost 42-10.
</P>
<P>
   So, if you're looking for omens, that would seem to be good news
for Atlanta's underdog Falcons on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the fact Dan Reeves was the Broncos' coach then.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, all of the aforementioned is utterly useless
information, of no import whatsover regarding the outcome of the
pending 33rd Super Bowl. With the one true, infallible constant _
the NFC champion's absolute, guaranteed superiority _ having been
removed a year ago when the Broncos took down the Packers, we start
a new period in the history of the game with the Roman-numeral
appendage.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh start
</P>
<P>
   With the coming of the final Super Bowl of the 20th century, the
slate is spotless. History means nothing. The only given when
Atlanta debuts against Denver in XXXIII is that the superior team
Sunday will win. Every bit of baggage is gone, no doubt misplaced
or chewed up by the Denver airport's computerized sorting system.
</P>
<P>
   When Joe Namath guaranteed a victory here 30 Januarys ago _
albeit because he was being heckled by a drunken Colts fan at a
banquet _ then saw the Jets' Buddy Ryan-coached defense deliver
same for him, New York ushered in an era of AFC dominance. The
junior conference would win 10 of the next 12.
</P>
<P>
   But then, for no apparent reason except the obvious one, the
worm did a full gainer. Starting with San Francisco's breakthrough
triumph over Cincinnati in XVI, the NFC took 15 of the next 16,
including the run of 13 in a row the Broncos terminated last year
in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Obvious you ask? Sure. The best teams kept winning. It just so
happened that, for the longest while, the NFC claimed ownership,
the same as the AFC had before it.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with the media hordes descending upon South Florida from
all points, it is assumed Denver remains the superior entry, which
is why the Falcons are charitably receiving seven points from the
oddsmakers. But the upstart Dirty Birds aren't big 'dogs by any
stretch of the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Their coming to the party might be judged a colossal upset based
on preseason expectations, but those have long since lost their
relevance. What matters is this: The Falcons are 16-1 in games
started by Chris Chandler, and a week ago they beat a then 16-1
Minnesota team on the road in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Our winged friends do not come to Florida as fodder.
</P>
<P>
   If we must weigh historical patterns, though, Atlanta must be
judged disadvantaged by being a first-timer. Of the 20 other
franchises who have been to the party, 14 tasted defeat as
debutantes. And those rookies with nicknames drawn from the animal
kingdom _ Colts, Dolphins, Broncos, Rams, Eagles, Bengals and Bears
_ are only 1-6.
</P>
<P>
   But again, such data seems inconsequential.
</P>
<P>
   Also, we are reminded no dome team has won a Super Bowl. Well,
no dome team until now has played in a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Summing it up
</P>
<P>
   The great outdoors, nonetheless, might prove unsettling to the
Falcons. Somewhat amazingly, they haven't experienced nature in the
raw since Nov. 8, when they walloped the Patriots 41-10 in Foxboro.
They lost twice on grass under real sky, but Chandler didn't
participate in the 28-3 Meadowlands defeat courtesy of the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos have been to five Super Bowls but none of the seven
played in Miami (five at the Orange Bowl, the past two at Pro
Player Stadium).
</P>
<P>
   Denver's worst hours of the season did occur at Pro Player the
Monday night before Christmas when the Dolphins won handily, but
that outcome meant squat, given the 38-3 revenge to be extracted by
the Broncos in the postseason. We now know John Elway can win a
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   We now know Chandler can win a playoff game. We also know
Terrell Davis and Jamal Anderson are both horses, good enough to
dictate Sunday's outcome if ball control matters as much as coaches
insist it does. We also know the Broncos held the Dolphins and the
Jets to a combined 28 yards rushing, whereas neither did much to
thwart Davis. On the information contained in this paragraph alone,
you might argue Denver should be at least a 10-point favorite.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos began the season 13-0 but have been up and down of
late. Atlanta is on an 11-0 run, inspired by the toughness and
dedication of a coach who had quadruple bypass surgery a little
over a month ago. A coach who was also fired by the Broncos after
taking them to three Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   The intangibles favor Atlanta; hard data defends Denver's case.
It makes for a compelling matchup, a fine way to end a century _
and launch a new era, whatever trends and quirks it might bring.

Super Bowl's prominence pretty much Jet-propelled
<TEXT>
<P>
   By MICKEY HERSKOWITZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   It was The Week That Was in pro football, a week unlike any
other, the week of Joe Namath and the New York Jets and the game
that would become the most historic of all Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   His style and skill and heart made Namath a star for his
generation. But five words, out of however many hundreds he spoke
that week, made him a legend. The words were: ``We'll win. I
guarantee it.''
</P>
<P>
   The team that delivered on that vow in January 1969, Joe and the
Jets, will be honored at a 30th-anniversary reunion Sunday in the
city of their triumph. The game changed football forever and raised
the sport's holy day to a stature equal to or beyond the World
Series, the Kentucky Derby, the Masters and other spectacles.
</P>
<P>
   The prediction was made on the eve of Super Bowl III at a
banquet in a Miami suburb. Only three writers had bothered to
attend, and no one seemed to raise much of a fuss at the time.
Broadway Joe had been saying it all week, one way or another,
telling a skeptical world the Jets, a 17- to 19-point underdog,
would upset the almighty Baltimore Colts on Super Sunday. People
had been falling down in helpless fits of laughter, reviving only
long enough to press their bets on Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts had beaten the next-best team in the NFL, Cleveland,
34-0 in what Tex Maule of Sports Illustrated said ``was definitely
the world championship game.'' Tex went on to pick the Colts to
squeak past the Jets 43-0.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Pope, a columnist in the host city and a more neutral
observer, thought it would be closer. Ed predicted the Jets would
score while losing 42-13. And so it went.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't even consider Namath's after-dinner boast to be his
best line of the night. During the speeches, Larry Grantham, the
solid and serious Jets linebacker, asked for a round of applause
for the players' wives, ``who had sacrificed so much.'' When Namath
went to the microphone, he suggested the audience applaud the
single women of New York, ``who sacrificed just as much and
complained a hell of a lot less.''
</P>
<P>
   Due to a combination of Namath's mouth and respect for the
Colts, who had won 15 of 16 games and not given up a touchdown in
six of them, many predicted a blood bath in Super Bowl III.
</P>
<P>
   This was the backdrop for a drama played out 30 years ago.
Hardly anyone gave the Jets a chance to win, yet there was a
strange karma in the air. Rated only the fourth-best team in the
younger, lesser American Football League, the Jets were living on
the beach like tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Weeb Ewbank had allowed the players to bring their
families with them. A picture still vivid is of Bob Talamini, the
chunky guard, trying to nap by the pool while his four kids ran
wild. He fished some change out of his swim-trunks pocket so his
wife could buy ice cream cones to keep them quiet.
</P>
<P>
   A former All-AFL selection with the Oilers, Talamini had joined
the Jets before the 1968 season. This is what playing in the AFL
title game, and the coming Super Bowl, meant to Talamini: ``More
money in one month than I made in my first three years in Houston.
Three years of two-a-day practices, preseason games, regular games,
injuries, all of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Colts seemed bored and short-tempered. Namath
almost goaded kicker Lou Michaels into a fight in a Miami bar
during the week.
</P>
<P>
   But on picture day, even hardened newsmen were touched when
Michaels talked about going against his brother, Walt, then the
defensive coach for the Jets. He talked about their home in
Sowyersville, Pa., their early life, how they depended on each
other. He was crying. He didn't want the writers to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Later, a reporter whispered to Jimmy Orr, the veteran Colts
receiver, ``Gee, did you see the way Lou Michaels was crying during
the press conference?''
</P>
<P>
   Orr nodded. ``If you were out drinking vodka until 6 a.m.,'' he
said, ``and there was a stiff wind blowing across your face, you'd
be crying, too.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for sentiment. But there was so much ill will, and so
many wisecracks, you almost dreaded the idea of having to sit
through the game.
</P>
<P>
   Many wondered if the Jets would be awed by the Colts, by the
Smiths _ the two huge fierce linemen, Billy Ray and Bubba _ and by
an offense that featured Orr, running back Tom Matte and tight end
John Mackey.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the season, the traveled Earl Morrall had replaced the
injured Johnny Unitas at quarterback. Not once had opponents forced
Morrall to bring his team from behind.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets watched game films of Baltimore hammering the Browns,
Steelers and Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weeb, you better stop showing us those films,'' complained
Pete Lammons, the former Texas end. ``We're starting to get
overconfident.''
</P>
<P>
   The portly Ewbank knew something the media and possibly the
Colts had missed. He believed his team had an edge in speed,
especially his deep receivers, Don Maynard and George Sauer. The
Jets had an emotional edge as well. Several of the New York players
had been cut by NFL teams. As a rookie with the Colts, Winston Hill
had lost the last roster spot to Ordell Braase. Now Hill, an
offensive linemen, would be going up against Braase.
</P>
<P>
   As an assistant coach with Cleveland, Ewbank had urged the
Browns to draft Don Shula as a defensive back. When Weeb was fired
as the head coach in Baltimore, Shula replaced him.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of more than 75,000 filled the Orange Bowl at game time,
including the crew of Apollo 8. Having gone around the world, the
astronauts decided to go someplace else, which explains how they
selected Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts drove to the Jets' 21 on their first possession, but
Michaels missed a field goal. Bad omen.
</P>
<P>
   New York wasn't supposed to be able to run on the vaunted Colts
defense, but Matt Snell slashed his way to 121 yards on 30 carries,
scoring from four yards out in the second quarter. Morrall didn't
see a wide-open Orr in the end zone, and the Jets led at the half
7-0.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, a fumble by Matte set up Jim Turner's
field goal, his first of three, and the Colts trailed 10-0. Namath
called a conservative game, but he did it with precision,
controlling the clock and passing for 206 yards with no turnovers.
Morrall and Unitas were picked off four times, and the Colts never
got untracked.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets won 16-7, and Namath was voted the Most Valuable
Player. But the best description of the day belonged to Sauer, the
bookish end who caught eight of Joe's passes for 133 yards. Sauer
compared the NFL to earthlings after being told by Copernicus that
the sun didn't rotate around them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must have been fantastic,'' Sauer said, ``to find out that
you are not the center of the universe.''

WAC REVIEWING NAILON SUSPENSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ With his usual smile on his face, TCU
preseason All-American Lee Nailon left for Tulsa with his teammates
yesterday morning.
</P>
<P>
   It appears unlikely, though, that he'll be playing when No. 21
TCU faces Tulsa tonight; a final decision will be made today.
</P>
<P>
   Western Athletic Conference officials said yesterday they were
reviewing film from an incident 34 seconds into Saturday's game
against Nevada-Las Vegas that led to Nailon being ejected for
fighting. Referee Bill Gracey ruled that Nailon had punched UNLV
guard Mark Dickel.
</P>
<P>
   In his report to WAC supervisor of officials Bobby Dibler,
Gracey said Nailon had been ejected for fighting, which carries an
automatic, NCAA-mandated, one-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Gracey also reported to Dibler that Horned Frogs coach Billy
Tubbs had yelled obscenities at officials after the game.
</P>
<P>
   For Nailon to play against Tulsa, WAC commissioner Karl Benson
would have to overturn Gracey's fighting call. Benson said he will
view film, confer with Dibler and make a decision before this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way that I could overturn the call was if there was a
gross error made,'' Benson said. ``TCU has asked us to review the
tape, though.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU assistant coach Brian Fish traveled to Denver late yesterday
with the tapes for Benson to review. TCU coaches argued that Nailon
simply had been trying to push Dickel away after Dickel had grabbed
the ball from under Nailon's arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't swing,'' Tubbs said after Saturday's game. ``The
rule says you have to swing at somebody. ... If you throw a punch,
that's different. And that's what Bill Gracey wanted to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Dibler talked with Gracey yesterday and said: ``When \RGracey\S
saw it initially, he said he saw a punch being thrown. He went to
the monitor to confirm, and he said that he again saw a punch. He
then ejected Nailon for fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Replays seemed to indicate that Nailon slapped Dickel, and
Dickel said he thought that Nailon's hand had been open.
</P>
<P>
   The question under review is whether Nailon's slap of Dickel
falls under the fighting rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a rolled up fist is thrown, that's easy,'' Dibler said.
``If it's an open hand but also thrown as a punch, you start
getting into a gray area. Karl is going to look at the tape because
maybe there is another angle or two that TCU has brought to our
attention. We want to be right. It's the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an important game for the Frogs (15-4, 3-2 WAC), who are
trying to prevent dropping to .500 in Mountain Division-play.
Playing without their leading scorer against Tulsa (15-5, 3-2 WAC)
would definitely be a blow.
</P>
<P>
   Benson's decision also has bigger implications for Nailon.
</P>
<P>
   If Gracey's call stands and Nailon were to be ejected for
fighting again this season, NCAA rules would sideline him the rest
of the season, including tournament games.
</P>
<P>
   Dibler said Gracey's postgame report included details of a
postgame incident with Tubbs. Benson confirmed that Gracey said
Tubbs came into the officials' locker room after the game ended,
kicked the door and shouted obscenities at the officiating crew.
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs said he went to the officials' locker room after the game
but denied any confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to talk to the officials after the game to get a
ruling, but they slammed the door in my face,'' Tubbs said.
</P>
<P>
   Horned Frogs athletic director Eric Hyman did not return
repeated phone messages yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Benson said Tubbs' actions also will be reviewed, and a private
reprimand, a public reprimand or a suspension are possible if he
finds Tubbs to have broken WAC sportsmanship rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has been reported to me,'' Benson said. ``Billy's
confrontation with the officials will be reviewed.''

sums to advertise on a show watched by men between the ages of 18
and 34. So programmers are madly scrambling to create series that
appeal to young men. Not long ago I watched a variety of shows _
including wrestling and ``World's Wildest Police Videos'' _ that
have particularly high numbers of young male viewers. I expected
crotch and flatulence jokes. Instead I found voice-overs shouted
with feigned amazement and a lot of ads for motor oil. A critic's
notebook. By Anita Gates.

   TV-RATINGS-RESCUE (Hollywood) _ Bruce Nash, one of the many
people trying to rescue network television from its steep ratings
slide, has an idea. Actually, he has a lot of ideas: 19 pages of
single-line thoughts, each for a different show that he believes
just might reverse the flight of viewers to cable channels, the
Internet and other forms of entertainment. By James Sterngold.
</P>
<P>
   ART-MONEY-MORALS (New York) _ Art and money. The two are forever
linked, but it is still unfortunate when they become virtually
synonymous. Lincoln Center has received offers of more than $15
million for a painting which has hung in the complex since 1964,
and the center's board has initially endorsed the sale. The
proposal to sell the work, a Jasper Johns painting, has stirred up
opposition and raises moral and legal issues concerning Lincoln
Center's obligation to the art on its premises, the artists who
made it and the nature of trusteeship in public institutions.

LEGACY AT STAKE FOR U.S. WOMEN IN WORLD CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ An hour before members of the U.S. women's
soccer team were due back to training camp Sunday, coach Tony
DiCicco had made up his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Practice would be a series of scrimmages. A round robin of
6-on-6 mini-games topped with a 20-minute, full-field match that in
case of a tie would be decided by penalty kicks.
</P>
<P>
   The point was, somebody was going to win. The coach knew that
after a three-day break this would be just the thing to get his
players' competitive juices flowing _ as if this team needed any
extra goading.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to like this,'' assistant coach Lauren Gregg
said, smiling. ``It's going to be a bloodbath.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to their world.
</P>
<P>
   And welcome to the 1999 Women's World Cup, a 16-country, 32-game
draw to be played June 19 though July 10 at the biggest venues
across America. So far, more than 200,000 tickets have been sold.
</P>
<P>
   For the U.S. women, World Cup fever already has started, since
the national team is taking the next five months to make sure it
does nothing less than win the whole damn thing.
</P>
<P>
   You don't win a decade's worth of World Cups, Olympics, Goodwill
Games and every other imaginable soccer title _ including the
unofficial moniker of greatest women's soccer team ever _ without
some hint of killer instinct.
</P>
<P>
   The women were more than happy to demonstrate that much Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   By dusk at the Seminole County Training Facility, the women's
training center this winter and spring, bodies were strewn across
the putting-green perfect soccer pitch like a re-enactment of the
Battle of Gettysburg.
</P>
<P>
   Star forward Mia Hamm's toe had been trampled and mangled so
badly she was relegated to calling offsides.
</P>
<P>
   Midfielder Tiffany Roberts, out of the University of North
Carolina soccer factory for national level players, finally
submitted to an ice pack for an ankle sprain that would have put
most NBA players on the injured reserve list for a week.
</P>
<P>
   But Shannon MacMillan, the former Portland standout whose goals
helped the U.S. win the 1996 Olympic gold medal, kept playing
despite a flower of blood blossoming through the tape and white
sock on the inside of her ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all right,'' MacMillan said, jogging off the injury and
looking for another long ball to come her way. ``I've just got a
hole in my foot.''
</P>
<P>
   If they were making a movie about this squad, they would call it
``Tough and Tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're pulling me out after only seven minutes?'' Michelle
Akers asked when a substitute was sent in for her during the
full-field scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   Akers, a Seattle-area product from Shoreline who will turn 33
next week, is the oldest member of the team. She has also battled
chronic fatigue syndrome over the past six years, although she said
she is feeling the best she has since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the veteran did not seem to immediately appreciate the
fact that her coaches were just trying to do her a favor by giving
Akers a breather.
</P>
<P>
   Other than those painful moments, the women were lucky it was
only about 70 degrees and the air was without a trace of that
notorious Florida humidity. DiCicco picked this secluded inland
training spot in part because the women trained here so
successfully for the '96 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   By March and April, the air here will grow as heavy and stifling
as a sponge _ a training condition DiCicco knows will best prepare
the women for whatever is doled out in Washington, D.C., Chicago or
Pasadena, Calif., this World Cup summer.
</P>
<P>
   A huge part of the motivation for this team is that after
winning the first Women's World Cup in '91, they lost in '95,
finishing third.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an ache there, not being the world champions,''
midfielder Julie Foudy said. ``We left that (second) Cup sitting
there in Norway.''
</P>
<P>
   For a team as successful as this one, it is hard to imagine they
have any sense of disappointment. But that is why this group is so
unusually motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an opportunity for us to put any doubt aside about which
team is the greatest women's team ever,'' DiCicco said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there any doubt?'' Akers said. ``I think we've already done
that.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean Akers and Co. will settle for anything less
than winning it all, which explains all the blood spilled on the
battlefield.

SONICS SOLD ON STEPANIA'S POWER POTENTIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ He has been here a week, and Sonic center Vladimir
Stepania's only impression of Seattle is the Space Needle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's special. But nothing special,'' the Slovenian rookie said
with a wide grin and a limited English vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's big,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   And after four days of Sonics training camp, the perception of
Stepania is about the same.
</P>
<P>
   He is special considering his array of offensive skills that
prompted the Sonics' long, hard fight to buy out Stepania's
European contract. Yet he is not that special considering his Space
Needle-shaped body.
</P>
<P>
   But Stepania is tall, and that makes him all the more
intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a 7-foot, 240-pound center flinging legitimate
3-pointers, dishing off no-look passes and handling the basketball
with the skill of a guard dodging traffic.
</P>
<P>
   This is Seattle's foreign phenom whose only drawback is that he
needs to fill out.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this moment,'' began Stepania as he does most of his
sentences, ``I'm not prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   While practices have shown Stepania is not strong enough to
handle the backup center role as originally expected, he should
contribute in some capacity.
</P>
<P>
   When Stepania faces the basket, he can dribble with either hand
and shoot a mid-range jump shot. He also is a good passer who can
use a number of moves to get a shot off under the basket.
</P>
<P>
   But he already has gotten pushed around quite often.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah,'' starting center Olden Polynice said. ``We've seen a
lot of those (European) guys. But he has the capability of being a
very good player. It's surprising to see a guy that big handling
the ball and shooting outside jumpers. He's more of a finesse
player. We're trying to get him to be more physical.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Aaron Williams, who will back up Polynice: ``I think he
already notices that it's a lot rougher over here. He's not getting
a lot of the calls that he would get over in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   What Stepania lacks in size, he makes up for with sheer guts.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of training camp, second-round draft choice
Jelani McCoy whirled on Stepania and stuffed the ball through the
rim so hard everyone in the gym screeched simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   However, Stepania drew the same reaction Sunday when he
virtually executed the same move while 6-foot-10 Detlef Schrempf
guarded him. After the rookie whirled and threw down a left-handed
dunk, he looked for a high-five from Schrempf.
</P>
<P>
   What Stepania got instead was a shove in the chest from the
veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hard time because I'm rookie on good team,'' Stepania
said. ``Practice is very different game. It's more tough physical
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Sonics coach Paul Westphal feels Stepania just needs to learn
the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not as lost today as he was yesterday. But he's still
deep in the woods,'' Westphal said. ``... He's got to get stronger
to be able to hold his position when he plays in the post. He does
some good things. He's got some real ability. He has to play to his
ability, though. When he learns what his advantages are and how to
hide his disadvantages, he'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   It took about two weeks after a new NBA collective bargaining
agreement was struck and a little drama before Stepania became
free. Negotiations seesawed before the Sonics bought out the final
year of Stepania's contract with $250,000, according to his
attorney Scott Boatman.A
</P>
<P>
   The payment was the most allowable by the NBA before money
counted against the Sonics' salary cap. Stepania finally signed a
three-year deal worth $1.71 million with the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about him is he is aggressive,'' forward Vin
Baker said. ``You can tell he really wants to play against NBA
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Stepania has seen nothing outside of his hotel room and
the practice facility. He said the NBA, not sightseeing, is what
coming to America is about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping to come here because I'm only 22,'' Stepania
said. ``I wanted to test myself in NBA. It's the best. Europe is
high right now. But at this moment, it does not look like NBA. The
NBA is big.''
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Point guard Moochie Norris is performing so well in camp
that he might have locked up the backup role. Said Westphal: ``I
don't see any reason why he's not an NBA player. He's done a real
fine job. ... I'm real glad we have him.''

PARTISAN OVERTONES AMID BIPARTISANSHIP TALK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Committee shake-ups in the state Senate and huge
trial lawyer contributions to Democrats may not have any obvious
connection to each other, but they do share partisan overtones in
this alleged era of bipartisanship.
</P>
<P>
   Both events made headlines last week in the afterglow of Gov.
George W. Bush's and Lt. Gov. Rick Perry's inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, in his first significant act in his new office, may have
pulled a surprise or two with his committee assignments. But surely
no one was surprised that he appointed more Republican (nine) than
Democratic (six) chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Partisan tides may rise and fall, but there is one fact of
political life that remains undisputed _ to the victor belong the
spoils.
</P>
<P>
   For the second legislative session in a row, Republicans hold a
majority of Senate seats. The Senate rules still give the
lieutenant governor the power to appoint Senate committees. And
there was no way in the world that the first Republican lieutenant
governor in Texas history was going to do anything but fill a
majority of Senate leadership positions with Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   This type of political math doesn't require a computer.
</P>
<P>
   No one, after all, was exactly shocked last session when
then-Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, a Democrat who prided himself on his
bipartisan approach to lawmaking, appointed more Democratic chairs,
even though the Senate had a Republican majority then.
</P>
<P>
   Perry vows that the Senate's work will still be conducted in a
bipartisan manner, and it probably will be _ mostly, anyway _ for
several reasons:
</P>
<P>
   _ As has been observed before, most legislative issues are
nonpartisan.
</P>
<P>
   _ A longstanding rule will still require a two-thirds vote to
approve any bill in the Senate. With only a 16-15 Republican
majority, neither party can gang up on the other.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bush, the maybe would-be president, is insisting on harmony.
</P>
<P>
   _ Democrats will still hold important Senate posts, although
Perry has scrambled the lineup, partly for partisan reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest loser in the committee shuffling was Sen. John
Whitmire, a Democrat from Houston, who lost the chair of the
Criminal Justice Committee, a position that he had held for three
sessions under Bullock.
</P>
<P>
   It was no coincidence that Whitmire also was a strong backer of
Perry's Democratic opponent, John Sharp, in last fall's lieutenant
governor's race.
</P>
<P>
   The new Criminal Justice chairman will be another Democrat, Sen.
Ken Armbrister of Victoria. Armbrister's new assignment is arguably
a demotion from his previous post as chairman of the prestigious
State Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The State Affairs plum went to Republican Sen. Florence Shapiro
of Plano, who has never had a committee chair before but headed the
Senate's Republican Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Perry also made a number of changes in the overall committee
structure. The sizes of some committees were reduced, he said, so
that senators would have fewer conflicts among committee meetings.
</P>
<P>
   He also split the old Health and Human Services Committee into
two smaller panels _ one on health services and the other on human
services.
</P>
<P>
   The official reason for creating two committees was to divide a
heavy workload. But in the world of politics, it is fair to
speculate that Perry also wanted to save a chair for Sen. Judith
Zaffirini of Laredo, who headed the old panel and will chair the
new Human Services Committee, and create a leadership opportunity
for Sen. Jane Nelson of Flower Mound, who will head the Health
Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson is a Republican. And Zaffirini, although a Democrat,
hosted a ``late-train'' fund-raiser for Perry after the Nov. 3
election.
</P>
<P>
   Perry retained several key Republican committee chairmen who
initially were appointed by Bullock. They include Bill Ratliff of
Mount Pleasant, Finance; Teel Bivins of Amarillo, Education; David
Sibley of Waco, Economic Development; and J.E. ``Buster'' Brown of
Lake Jackson, Natural Resources.
</P>
<P>
   Although the motivations of Senate committee appointments can be
subject to interpretation, there was nothing subtle about other
news last week that the five law firms that represented Texas in
the anti-tobacco suit gave $1.8 million to the Texas Democratic
Party last year and thousands of additional dollars to individual
Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Many people have always suspected that one of the reasons Bush
and other Republicans have opposed the high legal fees awarded in
the tobacco case was because they feared much of the money would
eventually end up in Democratic hands _ and maybe even be used in a
presidential race against Bush.
</P>
<P>
   That looks like a reasonable assumption.
</P>

   1. SPIES WANTED Are you a patriotic college graduate with a
skill for languages, a love of intrigue and a willingness to put up
with a hoary bureacracy? If so, send a CV to the CIA, Washington
D.C. By Tim Weiner. From The New York Times Magazine. Full-length
(3,800 words) + edited article available.

niece of the Chilean dictator's most prominent victim renders her
own verdict. By Isabel Allende. From The New York Times Magazine.
2,000 words.
</P>
<P>
   3. MEN HATE WAR TOO It has been suggested that males, in our
species and others, are more prone to violence than females. In
fact, war comes not from any genetic male tendency toward violence
but from social and cultural pressures. In fact, the male appetite
for battle has always been far less voracious than either
biologically inclined theorists of war or army commanders might
like. By Barbara Ehrenreich. From Foreign Affairs Magazine. 1,500
words.
</P>
<P>
   4. GREY DAWN : THE GLOBAL AGING CRISIS A little-understood
global hazard - the greying of the developed world's population -
may actually do more to reshape our collective future than deadly
superviruses, extreme climate change or the proliferation of
nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. By Peter G. Peterson.
From Foreign Affairs Magazine. 1,800 words.
</P>

   5. SPEAKING TRUTH TO POWER, OR LOYAL TO A FAULT? A president's
foreign policy aides have a moral commitment to their chief, but as
the Clinton sex scandal shows, there are limits. Loyalty must be a
two-way street. By Theodore C. Sorensen. Foreign Affairs Magazine.
2,000 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 6.
INDUS VALLEY : THE WORLD'S FIRST CITY Neither the Bible nor The
Vedas, (texts dating from some 3,500 years ago,) mention it. No
pyramids or burial mounds marked the area as the site of an ancient
power. Yet 4,600 years ago, great cities rose along the floodplains
of the ancient Indus and Saraswati rivers in what is now Pakistan
and northwest India. The people of the Indus Valley - a
stupendously successful civilization - built some of the world's
first planned cities, created one of the world's first written
languages, and thrived in an area twice the size of Egypt and
Mesopotamia for 700 years What happened to them? Shanti Menon
reports on this ancient, prosperous culture. By Shanti Menon. From
Discover magazine. 1,100 words + photos.

darling, a critic tells us why Picasso has given way to calendar
art. By Deborah Solomon. From The New York Times Magazine. 1,500
words.

THE POPE AND THE POOR In a country where, according to some
estimates, up to 60 per cent of the people are poor, and in a
region with the world's most inequitable distribution of income,
Pope John Paul II's trip to Mexico and Latin America this week will
inevitably sharpen the debate on the role of the Roman Catholic
Church in combating poverty and inequality. By Jorge G. Castaneda.
New York Times Op-Ed. 800 words.

   9. From NATURE NEWS SERVICE (N/A France and Spain. Embargo 18h00
GMT Wed. Jan. 27.) A. THIS WHALE'S LIFE : Genetic testing has
allowed two U.S. researchers to trace the life of a whale from
birth in the North Atlantic in 1964 to its sale as raw meat in
Osaka, Japan in 1993. Their findings may raise concerns about
international agreements to monitor whaling. By Henry Gee. 500
words. B. SIX MILLION YEARS OF DEGRADATION : Are you short-sighted?
Do you suffer from an inherited disease? Any allergies, headaches,
digestive problems? It is possible that many of the ills of
affluent human society are the consequences of a relaxation of
natural selection that have resulted from improved living
standards, exposing a legacy of the past six million years of
evolution - a story of slow genetic deterioration. By Henry Gee.
500 words. C. PHARMACY ON A MICROCHIP : A wafer-thin microchip
implant (the size of the nail on your little finger,) could be used
to deliver, independently, as many as a thousand different
substances into your bloodstream. By Henry Gee. 300 words.

HERE'S THE SUPER BOWL SCOOP FOR THE REST OF US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1999 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've been reading the sports pages in this interminable
time between the National Football League's championship games and
the Super Bowl, you've seen a lot of ink about Denver and Atlanta. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But in that whole flood of words, what have you really learned
about the cities the Broncos and the Falcons call home? Why, hardly
anything. It's all been about guys named Elway, Chandler, Sharpe
and so forth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which is why you're lucky to have me. I'm going to fill in the
inexcusable gap left by the myopic sportswriters and tell you
everything you need to know about Atlanta and Denver _ and maybe,
unless I run out of space, about Miami, too, the site of Super Bowl
XXXIII (99), which starts with the pregame show either tonight or
tomorrow morning. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For several reasons, let's begin with Atlanta. First, it has
alphabetical priority. Second, its team pretty much lucked its way
into the game and probably won't be back for a decade or two. OK,
then. The first thing to know about Atlanta is that it's not named
after Atalanta, who, in Greek mythology, was a renowned and
fleet-footed huntress. That's because no one in Atlanta had read
any Greek mythology until well after World War II. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, since 1981, when the best ex-president in history,
Jimmy Carter, left office and set up a slick library, study center
and fill dirt company in Atlanta, most mythology-writing efforts
there have been about Carter himself, who, you may recall, once was
a nuclear physicist, which means the stuff written about him can
more accurately be called geek mythology. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I know this will seem like an abrupt change in direction, but
one of the books I got for Christmas was Tom Wolfe's new novel, ``A
Man in Full,'' which is set in Atlanta. I know this because I've
already read the dust cover and 11 of the book's 742 pages. (At
this pace I'll finish the book in July 2004.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But novelists, like politicians, are known to take liberties
with the truth. So I wasn't sure whether to trust Wolfe's brief
history of Atlanta, which goes, in part, like this: ``First they
called it Terminus, because that was where the new railroad ended.
Then they named it Marthasville, after the wife of the governor.
Then they called it Atlanta, after the Western and Atlantic
Railroad and on the boosters' pretext that the rail link with
Savannah made it tantamount to a port on the Atlantic Ocean
itself.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But it turns out that Wolfe can read the ``Encyclopedia
Britannica.'' For right there in the entry for Atlanta I find
exactly the same information, except the encyclopedia says Martha
was the governor's daughter, not his wife. This would be Gov.
Wilson Lumpkin, a Georgia-ish name if I ever heard one. Whoever is
first to prove to me whether Wolfe or the ``Britannica'' is right
about Martha gets to read the rest of Wolfe's novel aloud to me. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I like Atlanta _ even more than I like its apparently magnetized
airport, which seems irresistably to draw in any plane within 500
miles of the place. Atlanta not only is the home of a singularly
engaging columnist, Celestine Sibley, who has been at the paper
there since the city was a pup, but it's also now the home (well,
anyway, nearby Alpharetta) of my niece, who recently delivered the
first grandchild born to any of my siblings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I notice here I've said nothing so far about Martin Luther King,
Ted Turner, the Braves or the 1960s' God-is-dead theologian, Thomas
J.J. Altizer. Still, I have no more space for Atlanta. On to Denver
and maybe Miami. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Denver is in Colorado, Miami in Florida. If you ever have to
choose between the two to serve a life sentence, take Colorado _ as
long as, to get there, you don't have to drive through western
Kansas. &QL;
</P>

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The curse of the Super Bowl
 &HT;    (For release Wednesday, Jan. 27, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ On the same afternoon that the Atlanta Falcons and
Denver Broncos arrived here for the Super Bowl, 21 Cuban refugees
also arrived _ dropped off covertly by a smuggler boat.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, it seems, is coming to South Florida for Sunday's big
game.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a room this week is tougher than locating Atlantis. In
the case of the refugees, at least they'll have a place to stay.
It's called the Krome Detention Center.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly, fans coming for the game wouldn't mind staying at
Krome themselves. It's easy in-and-out, attested to last week by
the escape of two convicted murderers awaiting deportation to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Being a native here is a pressure-filled existence; not only
because of the massive traffic jams caused by all those
corporate-leased stretch limos rolling all over town, but by the
sudden emergence of faraway friends.
</P>
<P>
   Before Minnesota lost its playoff game to Atlanta, I received a
call from a good friend in Minneapolis who, believing the Vikings
were unbeatable, was seeking tickets to the Super Bowl, but not in
the end zone or upper deck, he told me, more like the 50-yard-line
halfway up.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to be affable on the phone _ hey, who wants to call a
good friend a utopian idiot? _ and privately set out to root for
Atlanta. The Falcons' overtime field goal took a lot of pressure
off me as I did not have the slightest idea of where I could find a
ticket for my Minneapolis friend _ either at outlandish scalper
prices, or anywhere but in the nosebleed section.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a call from Denver. More friends, but with tickets to
the game. And no hotel room. They wondered if it was possible to
obtain two rooms at the hotel where the Broncos were staying.
</P>
<P>
   (Laughter bordering on hysteria.)
</P>
<P>
   Inherent, also, with a major event such as the Super Bowl, or a
national political convention, are my media colleagues who, having
nothing else to write other than the piffle uttered by athletes in
press conferences, delve into the social conditions of the host
community.
</P>
<P>
   This not only happens in Miami but in New Orleans, Chicago, New
York; wherever major events are hosted.
</P>
<P>
   One day last week I was in Atlanta on business not having to do
with the Super Bowl and picked up a copy of The Atlanta
Constitution. There on the front page was a staff-bylined story
from Miami, headlined: ``Will Miami show fans its sunny side?''
While the writer inserted some nice things about the area
(sunshine, parrots, Cuban coffee, etc.), the thrust kept coming
back to tourist crime, drug smugglers, crooked politicians and
other scurrilous acts that have so damaged Miami's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   But as I scanned through stories elsewhere in the newspaper, I
learned that a police officer had been murdered in a town near
Atlanta, a man posing as an Atlanta police officer raped a woman, a
murdered cab driver _ a Nigerian immigrant _ had to be identified
by his fingerprints, and an unidentified woman's body was found in
the front yard of an Atlanta house where, just four years ago,
another woman's body was found in its back yard. (Drop-off point?)
</P>
<P>
   I thought to myself: ``If the Super Bowl were being played in
Atlanta this week, all those media types would be writing about how
rough it is in the Atlanta area _ and to stay clear of neighborhood
yards.''
</P>
<P>
   It comes with the territory, or in this case, the event. An
overabundance of media types pursues anything to write about.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday, all this will be over. And we natives finally will be
able to erase the forced hospitality smiles from our faces, get
through a traffic light in less than three changes, know of a hotel
that doesn't have a four-day minimum stay, and find those two guys
who broke out of the only lodging facility with a ``Vacancy'' sign
hung out.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Lott and Barr join the minstrel show
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The chairmen of the Democratic and Republican national
committees have now dutifully denounced this noxious Council of
Conservative Citizens. The declarations of anathema are somehow a
bit pallid, but I suppose their decorum is preferable to having the
chairmen throw up on camera, although that would get the matter
just about right.
</P>
<P>
   The council is that icky bunch that surfaced when it was learned
Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., the impeachment whiz, had addressed its
members. It is, in effect, the successor to the White Citizens
Councils, coat-and-tie cousins of the declasse Ku Klux Klan in the
days of massive Southern resistance to racial desegregation.
</P>
<P>
   The council blusters against immigration and integration _ the
shopworn old parlay of nativism and racism. One of the featured
columnists of the council's publication sees America becoming ``a
slimy brown mass of glop.'' There's a lot more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   Barr swears he didn't know what the council was up to when he
spoke to it, which is doubtful. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
another speaker, says the same, which isn't believable at all. If
there's anything a lifelong Mississippi politician knows, it's who
these characters are. One CCC activist has twice chaired county
election committees for Lott.
</P>
<P>
   (Indeed, members say Lott himself belongs, but the senator's
spokesman says Lott ``does not consider himself a member.''
Apparently dodgy language is an abuse of office only coming from
Bill Clinton.)
</P>
<P>
   Both parties are embarrassed in this matter. Most of the
council's notable politician members are southern Republicans _
including a GOP national committeeman from South Carolina _ but the
head of the CCC says most of the 34 Mississippi state legislators
who belong are Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The CEO of the outfit, Gordon Lee Baum, is especially distressed
to have been read out of the GOP. He says the ``Wallace-Reagan
Democrats'' the CCC appeals to have given the Republican Party its
victory margins in the South in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   An odd construction, that _ ``Wallace-Reagan Democrats.'' Odd
not because it's amiss but because it's peculiarly honest. You
usually hear ``Reagan Democrats,'' meaning the blue-collar
Democrats Reagan won over. Fair enough elsewhere, but in the South
``Wallace Democrats'' is more like it, and has been ever since
Richard Nixon co-opted all but the vilest parts of George Wallace's
segregation-forever politics to get the GOP rolling in the region.
</P>
<P>
   That winking coziness with racism has been the dirty little
secret of Republican success not just regionally but, thanks to the
Southern influx, nationally.
</P>
<P>
   If you click on Barr's congressional web site, it will pipe
``Stars and Stripes'' for you, if you wish, or it will play
``Dixie,'' if you prefer. ``Dixie,'' which became the anthem of the
Confederacy, was written in, as it was then called, ``coon''
dialect to be performed by white minstrels corked up in blackface.
</P>
<P>
   It begins: ``I wish I was in de land ob cotton/ Old times dar am
not forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding.

 &HT;    Plenty of dry runs before the big day arrives
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Is it time to start stockpiling?
</P>
<P>
   People worried about the computer software flaw known as the
year 2000 problem, or Y2K bug, are starting to buy batteries and
bottled water. They fear the flaw will cause many computers to
misread the date 1-1-00 and trigger massive problems next January,
including power blackouts, natural gas disruptions,
telecommunications failures and traffic tie-ups.
</P>
<P>
   But optimists believe programmers soon will have the Y2K problem
under control. They say survivalists are wasting their money, as
well as their cupboard space.
</P>
<P>
   So will we have to wait until New Year's Day to find out which
camp was right?
</P>
<P>
   No. Clues to the Y2K riddles will appear long before 1-1-00. The
calendar is dotted with dates that will give us a good indication
of where we stand with Y2K. As we pass these milestones, we'll get
the information we need to determine whether to start hoarding.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, we already passed one such pressure point when the
calendar flipped to 1999. That date was important because many
early computer programmers had the quirky habit of using the number
99 to represent an ``end-of-run'' command, or even to mean ``dump
data.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, buried deep within the codes of many computers
are software time bombs set to blow up at the sight of ``99.''
</P>
<P>
   So what happened on 1-1-99? In Sweden, airport customs officials
found their computers wouldn't let them process passports after New
Year's Day. In Hong Kong, the harbormaster's computer died as the
new year began. In this country, a Blue Cross-Blue Shield system
that manages prescription drugs at 47,000 pharmacies froze up on
Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Those and other failures were fixed with relatively little
trouble, giving optimists reason to cheer.
</P>
<P>
   But Jan. 1 was just the start of the 99 bug. Another significant
date will be April 9 _ the 99th day of the 99th year. For similar
reasons, Sept. 9, also known as 9-9-99, will cause some computers
to crash.
</P>
<P>
   For different reasons, March 31 will be an important milepost.
On that date, the President's Council on the Year 2000 Conversion
expects all federal agencies to have completed Y2K repairs for the
software controlling critical systems. If on April 1 the evidence
shows that federal agencies, such as the Department of Defense and
the Department of Energy, are far from being ready for Y2K, it may
be time to start buying lots of canned tuna.
</P>
<P>
   Other problems will be revealed by midyear. For most states,
fiscal year 2000 begins July 1. If state computers start crashing
with the change to the new fiscal year, we'll know we're headed for
real trouble by Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   July 1 is important for another reason. That's when the nation's
104 nuclear power plants are supposed to inform the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission whether they are ready for Y2K. If it turns
out many plants still have big problems on that date, regulators
could start making plans to shut them down for safety reasons. A
bad report from the NRC could foretell a dark and cold January for
much of the nation, especially in the heavily nuclear-dependent
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   If computers start going haywire as the year progresses, there
is one date that may help. A referral service for therapists has
declared Dec. 1 to be ``Y2K Anxiety Day.'' Experts on calming
anxiety will be available by e-mail and online chat forums at Web
site 1-800-THERAPIST.com, and by videoconferencing and phone at
1-800-843-7274.
</P>
<P>
   But what if Y2K problems shut down our communications systems
and make it impossible to reach a therapist? Hmmm. Better reserve
Dec. 2 for ``Talk Face-to-Face with Your Neighbor Day.''

 &HT;    Fla. Gov. Bush adds appeals process to school plan
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush's plan to end social
promotion in public schools is not what it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   After 11 months of talk on the campaign trail about an
inflexible system that would bar promotion of students who fail the
Texas Assessment of Academic Skills test, Bush is ready with a
slightly retooled plan.
</P>
<P>
   The key change is an appeals process that allows local school
officials to promote students who fail the TAAS.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office is saying it in more flowery words, but
the bottom line is that he ran into strong opposition to his
no-pass, no-promotion plan. The new plan is a result of democracy
in action, not a campaign promise gone awry, according to Bush
spokeswoman Linda Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush listened to concerns of legislators and
educators who felt there needed to be opportunity for local
discretion in these limited instances,'' she said. ``During the
campaign you typically lay out your ideal proposals and then you
get more feedback on the specifics during the legislative
process.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan, to be offered as Senate Bill 1 by Senate Education
Committee Chairman Teel Bivins, will be laid out at news conference
today at Hillcrest Elementary School in Del Valle.
</P>
<P>
   Bush didn't waffle, said Bivins (R-Amarillo).
</P>
<P>
   ``He has consistently been a governor that sets goals and tells
the Legislature you pass a bill that accomplishes this goal,'' said
Bivins, a Bush ally. ``He set a goal, and the bill I will introduce
(today) accomplishes his goal within the real world of public
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't believe that this bill does great violence to
that goal. It allows local control where there are extenuating
circumstances,'' he added, calling the appeals process ``a
pressure-relief valve, a mechanism where local people would be able
to deal with extenuating circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   The new system, if approved by lawmakers, would create a system
``way different'' than it is today, Bivins said. Social promotion _
the practice in which students move up the grades without
necessarily mastering the subject matter _ has been targeted by
many as astoundingly counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   A Texas Federation of Teachers survey in 1996 concluded that
150,000 students are promoted in Texas each year without passing
their courses.
</P>
<P>
   But Bivins said a system where TAAS scores would be the ultimate
and sole arbiter of who gets promoted and who does not _ as pitched
by Bush on the campaign trail _ just would not pass legislative
muster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The child's parents, the child's teacher and the child's
principal have a better handle on what's going on with that child
academically than anybody else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The local-control function would come in the form of a ``grade
placement committee'' that will hear appeals on behalf of third-,
fifth-, and eighth-graders who fail TAAS but believe they should be
promoted. The committee, intended as a high hurdle, will include
the student's parents, campus principal and subject-area teacher.
It would take a unanimous vote of committee members in order for a
student who fails TAAS three times to be promoted.
</P>
<P>
   Students in public schools are required to take the standardized
skills tests near the end of third, fifth and eighth grades. High
school students must pass the final TAAS sometime during their
junior or senior years in order to graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, convinced that Texas schools advance thousands of failing
students, originally wanted to bar promotion for third graders who
fail the reading portion of the TAAS, and to fifth- and
eight-graders who fail the reading, writing or math portions.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, in a speech to school administrators, Bush said
no pass would mean no promotion, period.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no flexibility,'' he said. ``Beginning in the year
2003 we are shutting down social promotion, and we have given
school districts ample warning.''
</P>
<P>
   But last week, as the revised plan was being hammered out, Bush
said he now backs ``the notion of having a local option to
determine whether or not there is a mitigating circumstance that
prevents a child from moving on.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he wound up agreeing with lawmakers and interest
groups who want some local input in the promotion decision for
students who flunk TAAS.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Edwards said the appeal process is intended to
be a high hurdle, not one that routinely leads to promotion. In
addition, the number of students who fail TAAS but are promoted
could count against a school in the annual accountability ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins said the idea is to raise a flag on districts that ``just
flagrantly ignore TAAS results and promote children.'' The system
would be similar to one now in place in the Waco ISD, which makes
passing TAAS a condition for promotion.
</P>
<P>
   The Bivins bill will set out a structure in which students will
get three chances to pass. The first failure would lead to
placement in intensive remedial courses funded by the state.
</P>
<P>
   If the student again fails at the end of the school year, he or
she would go into a state-funded summer program. A third failure at
the end of the summer would lead to grade repetition or appeal.
</P>
<P>
   David Dunn, director of governmental relations for the Texas
Association of School Boards, said the addition of the appeals
process allayed his group's fear that Bush was doing an end run on
local control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been expressing concern over that for months now,'' he
said. ``We, of course, like some local flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In most districts, the hurdle is going to be fairly high'' for
failing students seeking promotion, said Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Edwards said the goal is to allow promotion of
students who fail TAAS ``only if the committee concludes that using
the standards adopted by local board of trustees, if promoted and
given accelerated instruction, the student is likely to perform at
grade level.''
</P>
<P>
   As the 1998 campaign wore on, Bush increasingly stressed that
his program would funnel failing students into the extra-help
programs they need. He downplayed the no-pass, no-promotion factor.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Edwards said getting kids the extra help they need
is the key part of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor's goal is to insure all students who fail the
TAAS get intensive help,'' she said.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Unpacking books brings shelf defeat
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Someone I once dragooned into sharing the
box-schlepping of a moving day made the pungent observation that a
library card is easier to lift than a library.
</P>
<P>
   True words. So true, I repeated them to myself last time I
lugged boxes to another address. A library card is a simpler thing
to store than a library, too, but I'd miss the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Every time you move along with your books, you gain a new
opportunity to make sense of them, to put them on shelves in ways
that will allow you to find them again. Surveying the empty shelves
and unpacking the boxes, I feel the thrill of possibility that
comes from building a new, more rational life. A life in which
fiction sticks with fiction, fact with fact, and political analysis
is quarantined away from the two.
</P>
<P>
   Organizing systems for books tend to grow like living things.
Book is placed by book, one at a time, stuffed in the space
allotted them the way plant roots fill a planting pot. Over time,
the pattern makes sense only in a constricted, shelf-by-shelf way.
</P>
<P>
   I looked at my old system and could only shake my head: science
fiction, 19th century fiction and travel shared a shelf because
they fit there. Comic books, art books and pre-Iron-Curtain-breakup
atlases were together because of their dimensions. Journalism and
humor were paired because they were packed together in the same box
last move. Or so I like to think.
</P>
<P>
   My deficiencies in rational book storage came home one day after
I bought a secondhand book, a book that was old without being
valuable, and noticed the vestiges of a formal book-organizing
system. This wasn't a library book, the book plate inside attested
to that, yet it had a Dewey Decimal number taped to its spine. Not
a precise, three-places-to-the-right-of-the-dot number, but an
intelligent approximation.
</P>
<P>
   Some compulsive, long-ago soul had actually ordered his library
along the lines of a public library. He probably didn't lend books
very often and chased kids _ if he had any, and I doubt it _ away
from his shelving system. I was both envious and creeped-out.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the great things about second- and third-hand
books: you get to speculate on past owners with similar interests.
They warn you about transitory nature of ownership. For if these
past owners could have held onto their books, you would not be
reading them.
</P>
<P>
   Was it death or divorce or change in circumstances that broke up
their shelves? Or did they just give up on their libraries on their
third and fourth moves and opt for library cards?
</P>
<P>
   Someone who Dewey-Decimalized his library could not have parted
with books easily or willingly. This, no doubt, was left to heirs
and assignees. Survivors who were left shaking their heads at the
boxes and the futility of numbering book bindings. Heirs who earned
their inheritance through mighty acts of cross-generational cleanup
and house-packing.
</P>
<P>
   Much as I admire this system, I cannot aspire to it. Categories
overflow from my shelves and resume in other rooms.
</P>
<P>
   I'm trying a different system with this move. Ordering the books
not by subject or author but by immediacy.
</P>
<P>
   The small shelf next to the bed is for books I really mean to
read soon. The folding bookshelf nearby, for books I really mean to
get to some undefined someday soon.
</P>
<P>
   The shelf near the desk: books that weigh on my conscience.
Books I should read. Someday. Books that were earnest gifts and
warm recommendations from friends.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on far bookshelves you can only see if you bend over,
are books left over from college, books I read once when I thought
differently, books on things I don't understand. Look, there's
Stephen Hawking's ``A Brief History of Time'' next to a signed copy
of a book by Lamar Alexander detailing what he did on a memorable
family vacation to Australia before he decided to spend his life
running for president. It was a nice gesture and too strange to
part with.
</P>
<P>
   This, too, is a system. One that forces you to examine your
priorities every time you go looking for a title.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if it will work. I mean to file my library card
someplace that makes sense, just in case it doesn't.

 &HT;    `A pox upon the house of progress' _ and that includes cell
phones
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ ``To live is to progress,'' some wise person
(or wiseguy) once penned. Pretty sound advice for folks who don't
want to spend a major portion of their lives as a chronological
error in the march of time, but I'm not one of them. Being a
remnant of another era doesn't bother me a bit. It's who I am.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get with it!'' my teen-age son used to urge when I complained
about the deafening dissonance he loosely referred to as music. I
would explain that not only did I not wish to ``get with it'' I had
no intention of getting anywhere near it. ``Just go with the flow,
Mom,'' was his adolescent advice. ``A pox upon the house of
progress!'' I'd shout over the racket and notify him I had every
intention of continuing my salmon-like swim upstream to
obsolescence because I
</P>
<P>
   liked it that way.
</P>
<P>
   The more I see of the ``P'' word (progress), the less it
interests me. In fact, after deep thought and due consideration (a
minute-and-a-half at the most because it doesn't take (SET
ITAL)me(END ITAL) long to jump to a conclusion), I've decided
progress doesn't necessarily equate with improvement. Remember the
Edsel?
</P>
<P>
   And now it's the cell phone, a communications miracle fast
becoming a major thorn in the side of civilized behavior. Last
Saturday night, my ex-sister-in-law Sharon (we used to be married
to brothers and now we're not) and I had put in a heavy day of
shopping and were looking forward to a relaxing dinner at a
favorite restaurant where the food is good and the napkins aren't
paper. It was crowded so we had to wait in the bar. OK with us; we
enjoy people watching.
</P>
<P>
   We'd been there only a few minutes when Sharon whispered,
``Don't look, but there are two guys sitting a couple of stools
down who might be our age and I think one of them's looking at
me.'' Instinctively, I started to swivel my seat for a better view,
but Sharon nixed that in an urgent stage whisper, ``I told you not
to look!'' I promised not to embarrass her, but just in case, I
asked what his friend looked like. ``I can't tell,'' she whispered
from behind her hand, ``he's on the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Humiliation notwithstanding, I turned and stared. ``I couldn't
help myself,'' was my lame excuse. Truth is, I just wanted to catch
a glimpse of a guy my age who'd sit in a bar on Saturday night
babbling into a cell phone. It's not normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he had to call the sitter,'' Sharon said hopefully. I
told her that for sure, any man of our years talking with a
baby-sitter meant only one of two things - either he was asking
about the grandchildren or he was checking up on his second wife
who was too young to be left home alone. Sharon complained about my
attitude. I went to see about our reservation.
</P>
<P>
   In the brief time it took me to track down the maitre d' and for
the two of us to figure out what name Sharon had given him (either
Hall or Baker because nobody can say Schuett without stirring a
snicker from the listening audience), the guy with the big eye for
Sharon had taken over my barstool. As I approached, he stood,
introduced himself, and offered me my seat back.
</P>
<P>
   Politely, I refused and slid over one which put me next to the
weirdo with the phone glued to his face.
</P>
<P>
   That was when a fit of what my mother used to call ``bad girl
behavior'' simply flew all over me. ``Hi,'' I mouthed at the one
visible eyeball, ``talking to the baby-sitter?'' The guy stared
like he was trying to figure out who'd turned over the rock and let
me out. I looked at Sharon and shrugged. She started to giggle. I
turned back to Alexander Graham Cellphone and tried again. ``Get
out much?''
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to do it for him because next thing I knew, I was
talking to his back. About that time the bartender signaled our
table was ready.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later over some world-class minestrone, Sharon
asked what I'd said to elicit such a swift rejection. ``Not a
thing,'' I assured her, ``except maybe to ask where he'd parked his
Edsel.''

 &HT;    It's time kids studied foreign language
 &HT;    By Ana Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ Our word for Wednesday was ``comer,'' Spanish
for ``to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   My bright students quickly mastered that so I tossed them
``comida,'' food.
</P>
<P>
   We were talking about restaurants. As a Junior Achievement
mentor who works with third graders at Ware Elementary School, I've
also taught them a
</P>
<P>
   Spanish word per week that is related to our lesson. The
children have
</P>
<P>
   responded enthusiastically. I am often greeted with ``Hola,
Senora Walker.''
</P>
<P>
   I believe that giving them a glimpse, however small, of another
language
</P>
<P>
   will make them comfortable as they encounter different cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, I have listened to many people say that young
children
</P>
<P>
   can learn language much more easily than older children and I
think that's true. During a meeting with editors last fall, our
state board of education
</P>
<P>
   representative Grace Shore, a former teacher, expressed a wish
that her
</P>
<P>
   grandchildren could be taught Spanish in the public schools as
part of a universal bilingual program. That is, all children would
be taught a language besides their native tongue.
</P>
<P>
   What a terrific idea.
</P>
<P>
   We are one of a handful of developed countries who does not see
to it that
</P>
<P>
   our children have this ability and it is a shame. For many,
teaching Texas kids Spanish makes sense because of our proximity to
Mexico. However,
</P>
<P>
   teaching them any other language would benefit them, our
community, our
</P>
<P>
   state and our country.
</P>
<P>
   One objection to increasing language offerings might be the
current lack of
</P>
<P>
   bilingual teachers. What's stopping us from making mastery of a
second
</P>
<P>
   language part of new teacher training?
</P>
<P>
   The drumbeat for raising the standards in our schools has been
steady for
</P>
<P>
   many years. If that is to be, we cannot keep doing things the
way we have
</P>
<P>
   always done them.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping into the 21st century by stepping into the world
community would
</P>
<P>
   be a boon for Texas schools. Our teachers and our students would
be better
</P>
<P>
   off mastering a second, or even a third, language. They would
have an
</P>
<P>
   additional marketable skill and they would gain self assurance
as they enter
</P>
<P>
   an increasingly global marketplace. They would also be more
willing to explore other cultures and would gain respect for
different peoples.
</P>
<P>
   After all, we can't forever hold our hands over our ears,
expecting
</P>
<P>
   everyone else to learn English as we sit in someplace called
Joaquin, Texas,
</P>
<P>
   eating bratwurst, munching egg rolls and drinking espresso.

 &HT;    Prime time' flashes by quickly
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ I had always thought teen-agers were the defiant
ones. After a stroll through the cosmetic aisles at the grocery
store, however, I think women in midlife must be the defiant ones.
</P>
<P>
   We can douse our face in ``age-defying'' night cream, brush our
teeth with ``age-defying'' toothpaste, color our hair with
``age-defying'' dye.
</P>
<P>
   Add ``age-defying'' to any product name and its sales no doubt
would soar. Age-defying deodorant, age-defying wart remover,
age-defying mouthwash.
</P>
<P>
   Food companies are missing out on a real opportunity here. Just
imagine age-defying macaroni and cheese or age-defying chocolate
mousse. Slap the right adjectives on it and chances are, we'll buy
it. We want to believe anything and usually do.
</P>
<P>
   Since I'm fascinated with words, I decided to look up ``defy''
in the dictionary. One of the definitions is ``to goad into trying
to perform something proposed as impossible.'' There you have it.
</P>
<P>
   I can defy all I want, but it doesn't alter the fact I'm at an
age where my body is changing. Perfect case in point: A group of us
mothers were talking about our teen-agers' soccer injuries when one
mom said, ``My knees hurt, too, but it's from compression, not
extension.''
</P>
<P>
   How true. We're compressing and depressing, sagging and lagging,
huffing and puffing our way into what is supposed to be the prime
of our lives. I think I missed my prime and am headed right into
the butt roast of my life.
</P>
<P>
   What exactly is the definition of this ``prime'' we're supposed
to be experiencing? Is it ``prime candidate for a facelift, knee
replacement, bladder tuck?'' Or is it ``priming our face for the
first coat of makeup?''
</P>
<P>
   Men are supposed to hit their prime in their early 20s, women in
their 40s. I've decided primes must be a great deal like autumn in
the Southwest _ it strikes about midnight one night in late
November when, in a one-hour period, all the foilage turns from
green to brown and then drops to the ground. Wouldn't it be my luck
to sleep right through my prime?
</P>
<P>
   All these years I have been holding before me the hope of
enjoying my prime. I've read countless articles on the energy,
focus and enthusiasm I will have for life at this golden time. I
will enter my prime and suddenly be compelled to seek further
education, start a home business, write the great American novel,
enter a marathon. I am counting on this prime, folks.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it hasn't come. Very little compels me. Actually,
nothing. My husband can barely get me out of the house to go to a
movie, much less to pursue a master's degree.
</P>
<P>
   I no longer make medical appointments all in one month, like I
used to. If I go to the optometrist, the dentist, and the
gynecologist all in one short period of time, I'd then have to go
to a psychiatrist to help with my sudden onset of depression. I
can't stand to hear all at once that every body part I have is
wearing out, grinding down or giving up.
</P>
<P>
   And so here I am: primed for my prime . . . and waiting. Will I
know when it hits? Will I suddenly wake up with a burning desire to
walk six miles? One day will every creative thought I ever had
tumble forth into a brilliant novel the New York Times will
describe as ``brilliant, compelling, original?''
</P>
<P>
   I look at this as my last fling. It's my bachelor party before
the wedding, my senior trip before graduation, my summer romance
before school starts. And I don't want to be in the bathroom when
my named is called.
</P>
<P>
   Worse yet, maybe I've already had my prime and, like everything
else lately, I've just forgotten it.
</P>

 &HT;    `Giant' moral dilemma
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Not having attended, when I saw headlines
describing George W. Bush's inaugural speech as a ``call for a
moral Texas,'' my gag mechanism almost popped a clutch.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it shouldn't. Certainly it wouldn't if the phrase came
from a pope. But whenever a politician draws a ``moral'' line,
watch it zig. Watch it zag.
</P>
<P>
   The moral guardians of the Reagan administration, for instance,
seemingly could find no immorality among polluters, savings and
loan charlatans or a covert American war machine.
</P>
<P>
   One eventually learns to take statements about ``moral policy''
with enough grains of salt to thaw a slippery overpass.
</P>
<P>
   The ``moral'' line commonly trumpeted is about private conduct
and, based on chat-room themes at the moment, is about the joyous
ensnaring of a president over it. We proceed confident that all
else are without sin, except for what we know from the latest
Hustler Web site posting (under Barr, Rep. Robert).
</P>
<P>
   Judging just from the heading, one might have assumed that a
Bush address on morality before an inauguration crowd might be one
of those, ``Do as I say, not as I did when I was young and
foolish,'' appeals.
</P>
<P>
   (By the way, no one appears to have pressed Bush with ``how
foolish were you?'' or ``how young?'' Judging by Henry Hyde's
criteria for ``young'', that could have been way back in George's
40s.)
</P>
<P>
   To Bush's credit, however, the essence of his speech was on the
real, genuine, underlying moral dilemma facing Texas, and all of
mankind. It has nothing whatsoever to do with out-of-control
hormones.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the near future,'' Bush said, ``there will be no majority
racial group in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that children in Houston's schools speak 63
languages. But if supporters pined for a call for tighter
immigration laws or maybe an ``official English'' pronouncement,
Bush spoke Spanish instead, about nuestra diversidad _ our
diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our diversity gives Texas new life, new energy, new blood . .
. and we should not fear it welcome it.''
</P>
<P>
   That very day, the Associated Press reported that Texas'
immigrant population had increased 51 percent since 1990, to 1.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the immigrant-bashing in some other states, there's
comparative truth to what Bush said next, that despite its
diversity Texas has ``never been fractured.''
</P>
<P>
   But if we look at our communities, and our increasingly
resegregated schools, we see racial fracture looming. And we know
that the age-old challenges inherent in a converging of peoples is
moral dilemma No. 1 for now and forever.
</P>
<P>
   As the camera pans the VIP section at such an event, just as
when it scans the jointly convened Congress, one is struck by how
unrepresentative things are in a nation where diversity so defines.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, in those crowds of VIPs are people who embody the
quest to distance one's self from a world of difference _ in
schools, in subdivisions, in worship.
</P>
<P>
   It will take more than gubernatorial fluency in Spanish to ride
out the bigotry and blame-casting that has been as much a part of
our history as the ``boot-tough cowboys'' whose values Bush
summoned at the rostrum.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' chief moral challenge is the one enunciated with care by
George Stevens' ``Giant,'' when a Texas tale of great scope ends up
focused on two pairs of eyes in a playpen _ of a little white boy
and a little brown boy.
</P>
<P>
   There is no minority in that playpen, no majority. There is no
history as far as those eyes can see. There is only finite space to
share and time, surely, to figure it out.

 &HT;    Parents can 'screen' movies beforehand
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Going to the movies is often a family affair. But
since each family has different standards as far as what is
suitable for children, parents have to do a lot of work to make
sure that what's on the screen is suitable for their particular
tastes and preferences.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the Web can come in handy. Many sites rate movies
and offer enough of a plot description to provide guidance before
you plop down $40 or so (once you've paid for the tickets and
bought some popcorn). And even when your expenses are lower,
perhaps just the few dollars it costs to rent a video, these
reviews can save you the inconvenience of watching just part of a
film and deciding it isn't appropriate for your family.
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop today is at a site that specializes in that sort
of information. It's called Kids-in-Mind, Parents Guide to Film and
Video and is located at http://www.kids-in-mind.com/. This site is
exceptionally easy to use, so perhaps even a parent can navigate
the joint. The opening screen offers a capsule review of recently
released films. But you can also find most any film by using the
alphabetical index tabs near the top of the page.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an example of what you might find there. Let's select a
film many people know, ``As Good as It Gets,'' so you can judge the
information in an informed way. Here are edited selections from the
review:
</P>
<P>
   Sex/nudity: A woman is shown from behind wearing only a towel
around her waist.
</P>
<P>
   Violence: There is an intense scene in which a gay man is
brutally beaten by three thugs.
</P>
<P>
   Profanity: Several scatological references, several anatomical
references, several racial and sexual slurs, several mild
obscenities.
</P>
<P>
   The actual review goes into much more detail, but that should
give you an idea of the kind of information you'll get here.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's check out a place called FamilyStyle Movie Guide at
http://www.familystyle.com/. You'll find much of the same type
information here as you did at Kids-in-Mind, but using multiple
sites is useful, since it is helpful to find reviewers that suit
the tastes of your family.
</P>
<P>
   This site also is worth bookmarking for another reason. It
includes a list of 100 great family movies. Think of it as a guide
for exploring really terrific cinema.
</P>
<P>
   We can take a movie from that list to show the sort of
guidelines you'll find here. And it's a movie you are almost sure
to know, ``Casablanca.'' Here's what the site had to say about it,
as far as providing information on whether it would be appropriate
for your family to view as a rental video.
</P>
<P>
   Nudity: None. Sex: None. Violence: very little, shooting, police
raid. Drugs/alcohol: alcohol, some, accepted.
</P>
<P>
   As you can see, there's very little detail here, especially when
compared with our first site. On the other hand, what you do get is
probably sufficient to make a judgment.
</P>
<P>
   And some families will appreciate the fact that details about
drug and alcohol use are included in the review.
</P>
<P>
   Our next site is called Freeze Frame and is located at http://
</P>
<P>
   members.aol.com/freezfram/index2.html. It has a philosophy that
may appeal to some families. Here's how the site describes the way
it rates films:
</P>
<P>
   ``As most of us know ... movie ratings can be deceiving. An
R-rated film may have nothing more than a few scenes of implied
violence, while a PG-13 film may have a several scenes of nudity as
well as volumes of harsh language.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our hope that you use our reviews as a means of
`filtering out' the films you may or may not want to view.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's take a look at what you get here, using a film called
``Buddy.'' That film was shown with a PG rating.
</P>
<P>
   Profanity: ``Oh, my God.'' Sex and Nudity: none. Gore and
Violence: Ape attacks woman.

 &HT;    Apple sees game-playing power as key to expanding home market
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The jazzy iMac, released last August, was Apple's
beachhead in the home market. Now the company plans to expand this
foothold by making the iMac and other Apple computers the best for
playing games.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that entertainment applications drive the home
sales for all electronic gear. For most of its history, Apple's
ignored game developers and saw its share of the home market fall
sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's strategy is twofold. First, it hopes to build the best
hardware on which to run games. That's already under way with the
iMac, built with a super-sharp screen and the microprocessing power
to run today's graphics-intensive games.
</P>
<P>
   This year Apple Computer will further enhance the game-playing
power of its next generation of computers. These machines will
incorporate Silicon Graphics' OpenGL 3-D graphics standard, already
the standard among PCs. That means PC developers, which write most
games, won't have to completely rewrite their code when converting
products to the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer also plans to add Rage 128 graphics accelerator
cards in all upcoming computers. This card will speed up game play
by up to 20 percent, say company engineers.
</P>
<P>
   These recent announcements have been well-received by game
developers, many of whom had abandoned the Mac in the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
   A small but steadily growing number of developers have announced
they will once again publish for the Mac. Among those renewing
their commitment are PopTop Software, Terminal Reality, Epic
MegaGames and the all-important Id Software, maker of ``Quake.''
</P>
<P>
   Games coming to the Mac this year include ``Railroad Tycoon
II,'' ``Fly'' and ``Jazz Jackrabbit 2.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Connectix recently announced it will soon release
software that lets Macs play Sony PlayStation games. About 70
PlayStation titles will be compatible with its new software,
Connectix says.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere was this return to the Mac market better represented
than at the recent MacWorld industry conference, where Id Software
co-founder John Carmack shared the stage with Apple Computer
interim Chief Executive Steve Jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here today because Apple Computer has finally gotten its
act together,'' Carmack told the audience.

 &HT;    Webbys taking a spot among coveted awards
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Look, Web geeks _ an awards show for us!
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone by the Oscars, the Emmys, the Grammys or even
the American Music Awards, the International Academy of Digital
Arts and Sciences (don't ask, we're not sure who they are, either)
has announced nominees for the 1999 Webby Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Webbys are given in 22 categories including Arts, Commerce,
News, Games and our personal favorite, Weird.
</P>
<P>
   A list of the nominees is available at
http://www.webbyawards.com. A large panel of judges ranging from
``Dilbert'' creator Scott Adams to musician David Bowie, along with
Electronic Frontier Foundation pioneer John Perry Barlow and
conservative pundit Arianna Huffington, will pick the winners, to
be announced March 18.
</P>
<P>
   But the real fun of the Webbys _ or any awards show for that
matter _ is handicapping the winners. So put on your virtual formal
wear and let's take a look at this year's nominees.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce category (that's online shopping to regular people)
is pretty much a no-brainer. We have Amazon.com, CDNow, online
auctioneer eBay, the Gap and the Tie Rack (http://www.tierack
</P>
<P>
   .com) battling for top honors. In this category, the Tie Rack is
the equivalent of a foreign film or Disney animated feature getting
tossed into the Best Picture Oscar category. No matter how good it
is, it won't win anything, and it's not that good to start with.
The Gap won't win anything because it has actual stores in the real
world _ good for business, bad for Web awards.
</P>
<P>
   While we'd love to give the Webby to eBay for innovation, sheer
quirkiness and all-around fun, we think Amazon.com will win in a
walk with its combination of easy ordering, overwhelming product
selection and excellent design. Amazon is the only site nominated
in two categories. Its second Webby nod is for technical
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Webbys are a little harder to handicap. Some of
these sites are fairly obscure but worth a look, just to see what
Web taste-makers have lifted above the din to merit-worthy status.
</P>
<P>
   In the Print and Zines category, known quantities Salon and
Slate were both nominated, but so were Feed
(http://www.feedmag.com), an intelligent and intellectual 'zine
from New York, and Nerve, a risque online magazine that tries to
take a literate and intelligent look at love, sex and
relationships. (Warning: This site isn't for everyone and
definitely not for children.) Categories like this illustrate Salon
isn't the only online publication with intelligent writing designed
for intelligent people.
</P>
<P>
   Another interesting category is Sports, where ESPN Sportzone,
one of the most popular sites on the Web, didn't get a nomination
and neither did CBS Sportsline. Nominees in this category include
Quokka Sports (http://www.quokka.com), a beautiful but very odd,
hard-to-navigate Web site that claims to offer viewers an
``interactive sporting experience.'' Also in the Sports category is
SoccerNet (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .soccernet.com) and GolfWeb. The selection here feeds into the
stereotype of Web surfers as a bunch of nerds staring endlessly at
their PCs with a bag of Doritos and a six-pack of soda at the
ready. Lots of neat sports sites like Fastball, FansOnly and a
variety of creative and interesting sites for individual teams were
left off the list.
</P>
<P>
   The Politics category was clearly selected by California
residents, with two sites of California-specific content nominated,
further adding to the myth all Web surfers live in California.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to see what's nominated but don't have the time to
look over every category, take a trip to the nominees in the Arts
category. Each site is an example of outstanding Web design and
innovation. It's a good bet you've never heard of Park Bench
(http://www.cat.nyu.edu/parkbench) and Doors of Perception
(http://www.doorsofperception.com), but they are worth a visit to
discover the Web is a truly creative medium that offers users much
more than one-click ordering.
</P>

 &HT;    Consumers land best deals by comparing sales quotes online
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Need it quick. Need it cheap. What can you do for me?
</P>
<P>
   That New Age shopper's refrain, blurted out by nearly everyone
at some time, is being heard and answered daily on the Internet,
the world's fastest-growing bazaar.
</P>
<P>
   Listeners include the transportation industry, with players like
Travelocity, and the book and record distributors like Amazon.com,
Barnes &AMP; Noble and many more.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most intriguing to me personally, however, are the
players that give quotes, such as auto, life and health insurers _
and that classify us in mere seconds based on factual information
about our lives.
</P>
<P>
   They get high marks from the consumer arbiters like Kiplinger
and Money magazine, too.

<P>
   Benn Konsynski, an Internet commerce specialist at the Goizueta
Business School, put his finger on what's special about Internet
selling by price quote:
</P>
<P>
   ``They give us fast results,'' he said, and they give us the
pleasure of self-service, the feeling ``of letting the customer
choose, or design, the ultimate offer.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, it's empowering.
</P>
<P>
   Just a week ago, I needed tickets to Washington for a personal
business trip. I punched up the Travelocity site
(http://www.travelocity.com), where I was taken by the hand,
invited to request a flight, a car, a room. I got two round-trip
tickets between here and Dulles Airport for just over $400 on
AirTran, a car from Thrifty for $20 a day with no mileage limit,
and the transaction took every bit of 15 minutes. The car rental
price was less than one-way cab fare. Most of the time was consumed
by my price comparing, for airline tickets that ranged from $208 to
nearly $1,000, and car rental prices that ranged from $20 to $55!
</P>
<P>
   The tickets were delivered to my home at 8 the next morning via
Federal Express at no extra charge.
</P>
<P>
   Book distributors like Amazon (http://www.amazon.com) and Barnes
&AMP; Noble (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .barnesandnoble) and others are efficient in putting
best-sellers in our hands fast. But recently I had a special need _
a book that was out of print, the autobiography of the late Carl B.
Stokes, former mayor of Cleveland, that had not been on shelves for
10 years. A used copy of the book was located by Amazon and
delivered in a week.
</P>
<P>
   For people who are still wondering if it is worth it to shell
out $500 for a new 300-megahertz computer, such as the eMachine now
being sold by Office Depot, this is the kind of convenience
Internet users now take for granted. The eMachine, by the way, is a
clone of the popular Apple iMac.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive as Travelocity and sites like it are, I am intrigued
even more by the likes of InstantQuote (http://
</P>
<P>
   www.instantquote.com) or 4autoquotes.com
(http://www.4autoquotes.com/autoinsurancequotes.shtml), where you
say what state you're from, your neighborhood and various personal
information, and you get back car insurance or health or life
insurance quotes from a variety of companies.
</P>
<P>
   Like most, I'd rather endure a diet of bread and water than deal
with certain car or insurance salespeople. Every once in a while
you would like to announce that you want a simple term insurance
policy, perhaps to supplement your company benefit, and you don't
want to hear about all the ``smarter'' and ``newer'' and ``more
comprehensive'' products before getting down to your actual needs.
</P>
<P>
   The computer listens to you and delivers what you ask, or gives
good clues for finding what you want.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, I had that great moment in life that comes to many
people, when you have to disclose to your insurance company that
your teen son will soon be driving the car, and you wonder what
will be the new price of the annual insurance premium. It is a
number you prefer to hear in the privacy of your den, sharp
instruments out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   With quote service, you get within minutes not one shocking
number but a range of answers to the question, letting you know
immediately that there are options, there is room for negotiation,
that you will be able to feed the family and have car insurance
after all.
</P>
<P>
   In my case, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that it was
more cost-effective to remain with my insurer of many years than to
change to a new company.
</P>
<P>
   Konsynski, a professor of information and decision analysis,
says there are several business dynamics at work in the quote-sales
system on the Internet. The databases on which the sales quotes are
made are decades old, but computers put the customer and
information together in dazzling new ways.
</P>
<P>
   Also, some of the systems, in effect, collect consumers and shop
them around among the suppliers, thereby helping airlines fill
empty seats late in the day or week at the best price possible
under the circumstances. It is an auction of sorts. They also use
up the capacity in ways that bring new efficiency to business,
which in the long term produces volume and more favorable prices.
</P>
<P>
   What all of this means or portends is that we will see more such
selling.
</P>
<P>
   It also means new aspects of products can be sold.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in
Washington has produced rather grim but useful tables that show how
likely you are to be killed in your car compared with others should
you accidentally collide with something _ or, to be positive, how
much more or less survivable a crash is in your car. It's at
http://www.hwysafety.org/crash/crashgen/ddr2.htm.
</P>
<P>
   It is an example of discreet information that could well tilt a
sale in a close call, or even provide essential information for
certain buyers. It is an example of the Internet's special power to
find markets and pull them together, however dispersed they may be.

 &HT;    E-commerce will undergo normal weeding-out process
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sometimes the simplest truths are the most
disappointing. We tend to believe the bizarre and discount the
obvious.
</P>
<P>
   I say all this to prepare you for my simple explanation of a
fundamental change that's just beginning. I'd like for you to think
of this big change as the normalization of the Internet. The
reasons for the normalization are obvious _ the Internet is
becoming the pipeline for big and important businesses. It's no
longer a novelty.
</P>
<P>
   As this happens, the businesses that use the 'Net as a virtual
shopping center begin to follow the normal patterns you'd see for
retailers at the mall. And shoppers _ as the ``new'' wears off the
experience _ are no longer willing to ignore the failings of an
Internet-based retailer. That should be obvious. But it is my job,
many times, to explain the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   We'll use, as our text for today, a big survey that came out
last week that indicates while more people than ever shopped using
the Internet over the holiday season, there was a dramatic decline
in satisfaction with that shopping experience. About 14 percent
fewer people, according to the survey by Jupiter Communications,
were pleased after shopping. Before you sell all your Internet
commerce stock, keep in mind 74 percent of those who shopped were
still pleased.
</P>
<P>
   But the downward trend is an important one and maybe even a
voice of sanity.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why this may be the first movement toward a saner
interpretation of the Internet. For a while now, all a company has
had to do to see its stock shoot upward is to call itself an
Internet company. It hadn't mattered, as far as the stock market
was concerned, whether the company made a profit or even did a good
job.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Internet is still relatively new and trendy, there's
this sense _ among investors, but also with the rest of us _ that
it represents a new and almost magical power in the world.
Investors have wanted to get in on the action in the same way
prospectors headed to the West to get in on the ground floor of the
gold rush.
</P>
<P>
   But, once the novelty of logging on to the Internet is stripped
away by time and familiarity, e-commerce on the 'Net becomes
something really mundane and familiar. It's simply a fancy
mail-order catalog. And, when it comes to mail-order catalogs, I'm
an expert. Not only do I get catalogs for everything from gourmet
fruit to Duroc hogs (never bought one, not sure the neighbors would
understand), I spent about six years working for an RJR Nabisco
company directing its direct-mail efforts.
</P>
<P>
   We had a bunch of hotshot statisticians, Ph.D.s who could talk
for hours without using the same word twice, but when what they
said was translated into a language similar to English, here's what
they said: The world is divided into two camps, and the members of
those camps seldom change allegiances. There are people who buy
sight unseen from direct-response companies, and there are people
who buy only in a store.
</P>
<P>
   It's another case of the obvious sounding too simplistic and
too, well, obvious.
</P>
<P>
   But, near as I can tell, that's what is beginning to happen on
the Internet, too. The fans of Home Shopping Network, the
Fruit-of-the-Month Club and L.L. Bean will shop online. Those who
like to buy from a real-life store manned by real-life clerks will
do so.
</P>
<P>
   And as that happens, the best of the online merchants will
attract direct-response buyers and will prosper, and those who
relied mainly on the magic of the Internet will not

 &HT;    All Music Guide is a virtual library
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Music lovers should check out what many consider the
premier music site on the Web. It's called All Music Guide and
features a library's worth of information about all kinds of
popular music. On the rhythm and blues page, you'll find a listing
of what the Webmaster considers the top three albums of such
masters as Aretha Franklin, Al Green and Otis Redding. You'll find
this site at http://www.allmusic.com.

   ``Oh my God,'' declares the bright orange headline on the cover
of the January issue of PC Gamer, ``they made a South Park Game!''
It's true. The magazine has a detailed review of this computer game
based on the infamous Comedy Central cartoon. The magazine says
those who enjoy this crude show will not be disappointed. The game
version of ``South Park'' features the same characters and gags as
the show. Not surprisingly, the plot is secondary to the game. And
you won't find guns. But the boys of ``South Park'' are armed to
the hilt with ``action toys.'' They have snowballs, sponge dart
guns and a cow launcher _ among other things _ to fend off killer
turkeys.

   Since the success of ``Deer Hunter,'' there's almost nothing you
can't hunt on your computer. The newest additions to the digital
prey are dinosaurs. In WizardWorks' ``Carnivores,'' players hunt
these giant reptiles in a fantasy prehistoric world. Among the prey
you'll find T-Rex, Stegosaurus and Velociraptor. Unlike in other
hunting games, in ``Carnivores'' the hunter can become hunted.
Hunting in this game is more of a death match between you and the
prey. ``Carnivores'' is available only for Windows PCs.
</P>
<P>
   With the new year beginning, some computer users might be
considering taking stock of their financial position. There's some
new software to help you do it. Kiplinger's NetWealth helps you
calculate your net worth, analyze your investments and plan for
retirement, among other things. The CD includes a mutual fund
selector, portfolio manager and college locator. It also includes
video clips of financial advisers and links to more information on
the Web. NetWealth is available only for Windows 95 or 98 PCs.

This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

criticism from publishing houses.)

   Raul Salinas Found Guilty Of Assassination  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a verdict that signaled the end of impunity for the mighty in
Mexico, a federal judge convicted Raul Salinas de Gortari, the
brother of former President Carlos Salinas, of masterminding the
1994 political assassination of a prominent politician. The judge,
Ricardo Ojeda Bohorquez, also sentenced Salinas to 50 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``This breaks all the precedents,'' said Sergio Aguayo Quezada,
a historian. Raul Salinas is a symbol, the brother of one of the
strongest presidents Mexico has ever had. The judge's decision
gives an enormous boost to the independence of the justice
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the judge's decision left the public uneasy, because it
was based largely on circumstantial evidence in a case tainted by
torture and evidence-tampering by prosecutors. The defense will
appeal.

</P>
<P>
   The jury found that Capano had murdered Anne Marie Fahey, who
had tried to end their love affair. Capano admitted to dumping Ms.
Fahey's body in the Atlantic Ocean but blamed the actual killing on
a former mistress.

<P>
   The disappearance of Ms. Fahey, whose body was never recovered,
and the subsequent trial of Capano, who along with the victim had
worked for the state's governors, had transfixed Delaware for more

   An Update on Fiber  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Turning conventional dietary wisdom on its head, a team of
Boston researchers announced that eating fiber does not prevent
colon cancer. Their 16-year study of more than 88,000 female nurses
found that women who ate a diet rich in fruits, vegetables and
whole grains were no less likely than others to develop the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   But don't bite into that burger and fries just yet. Some experts
found flaws in the research. And fiber still wards off heart
disease, the nation's leading killer.

   Special Funds for Iraq  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even with oil prices at record lows, Iraq has begun to sell
enough oil under a special U.N. relief program that Baghdad can
make improvements in its broken-down electrical supply system.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the ``oil for food'' program, which has provided
every Iraqi with a monthly ration of food, medicine and basic goods
like soap and cooking oil, said that more than $81 million had been
released for the purchase of power-generating equipment, most of it
from China. Iraq, under trade sanctions since 1990, has also
recently bought telephone equipment and computers.

   Hacker Destroys USIA Web Site

   The intruder was mean as well as clever. Not content just to
invade the Web site of the U.S. Information Agency and leave a
cryptic message, he (or she) knocked the site off the Internet. By
week's end, computer experts at the agency, which oversees a
variety of cultural and educational-exchange programs, were still
trying to restore the site and promising better security. The
intruder called himself ``Zyklon,'' perhaps after Zyklon-B, the gas
used in Nazi death camps.

   Clean your fingernails. Make sure no food is stuck between your
teeth. Polish your shoes. And your resume.
</P>
<P>
   For years, self-help books have been preaching these basic rules
for job interviews. Getting in the door is a good start, of course.
It's your chance to separate yourself from that stack of
applications, to impress the prospective boss with all your
personal charm. The goal isn't just getting in the door, though.
It's leaving with a job.
</P>
<P>
   But some sad sacks never get the word. A survey of personnel
executives at 200 of the Fortune 1000 companies turned up a wide
range of strange and self-defeating behavior by some applicants
about a year ago. The results are a primer on what not to do on a
job interview.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted for Commemorative Brands, a
manufacturer of high-school and college class rings, by the New
York research firm Schulman, Ronca and Bucuvalas. Here is a
sampling of comments from the interviewers:
</P>
<P>
   _ TOM KUNTZ
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The reason the candidate was taking so long to respond to a
question became apparent when he began to snore.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``During the entire interview, the applicant wore a baseball
cap. . . . A few days later, another college graduate showed up for
a management trainee position wearing overalls and sandals.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``When I asked the candidate to give a good example of the
organizational skills she was boasting about, she said she was
proud of her ability to pack her suitcase `real neat' for her
vacations.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Wanted to know if employee perks included a swimming pool,
paid lunches at the company cafeteria or a free computer to use at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Why did he go to college? His ill-conceived answer: `To
party and socialize.' ''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``He couldn't answer any of my questions because he had just
had major dental work.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``When I gave him my business card at the beginning of the
interview, he immediately crumpled it and tossed it in the
wastebasket.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I received a resume and a note that said the recent high
school graduate wanted to earn $25 an hour _ `and not a nickel
less.' ''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``He had arranged for a pizza to be delivered to my office
during a lunch-hour interview. I asked him not to eat it until
later.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Said she had just graduated cum laude, but had no idea what
cum laude meant. However, she was proud of her grade point average.
It was 2.1.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Insisted on telling me that he wasn't afraid of hard work.
But insisted on adding that he was afraid of horses and didn't like
jazz, modern art or seafood.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The candidate never looked directly at me once during the
entire interview. Just stared at the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``An otherwise qualified candidate took herself out of the
running when she opened her mouth. She had her tongue pierced.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``She actually showed up for an interview during the summer
wearing a bathing suit. Said she didn't think I'd mind.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``He sat down opposite me, made himself comfortable and
proceeded to put his foot up on my desk.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The interview had gone well, until he told me that he and
his friends wore my company's clothing whenever they could. At
which point, I had to tell him that we manufactured office
products, not sportswear.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Applied for a customer service position although, as he
confided, he really wasn't a people person.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``When I mentioned that we had gone to the same college, he
stood up and began to belt out the school football fight song.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Without asking if I minded, he casually lit a cigar and then
tossed the match onto my carpet _ and couldn't understand why I was
upset.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``On the phone I had asked the candidate to bring his resume
and a couple of references. He arrived with the resume _ and two
people.''

   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ There are no wedding pictures here. No
babies. No birthdays. No graduations. No romantic moments.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary life ceased by fiat, by terror, during the four years
the Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia, causing the deaths of more than a
million people and dressing those who lived in black.
</P>
<P>
   Its absence echoes in the photographic record of the Khmer
Rouge: Apart from certain bureaucratic records and formal
occasions, almost no one was taking pictures.
</P>
<P>
   When the radical communist movement _ purer than Stalin, more
ascetic than Mao _ seized the country in 1975, it eliminated
culture and modern life: no cities, no money, no education, no art.
Even family life was abolished in favor of communal, often fatally
exhausting, labor.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras were among the artifacts of technology and development
that disappeared. Ownership could be a death sentence as evidence
of an educated past. Only a handful of officially approved
photographers recorded officially approved subjects for those four
years.
</P>
<P>
   The leading photographer of the Khmer Rouge time appears to have
been a young man named Nhem Ein, who was sent to China to learn the
craft and was then assigned to the staff of Tuol Sleng prison,
where some 14,000 people were tortured and sent to their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   He left behind a stunning body of work: 7,000 or more portraits
intended as a bureaucratic record of prisoners entering Tuol Sleng.
All the subjects died; only the portraits survived.
</P>
<P>
   In his free time he also turned his camera in other directions:
a dinner party at the home of the prison's warden, a pile of bodies
on the floor, a holiday snapshot in front of a local monument, a
work brigade.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the pictures come from two troves, both of which may be
the product of Nhem Ein's work. One is Tuol Sleng itself, where in
the years after the fall of the Khmer Rouge two decades ago
researchers discovered thousands of negatives and contact prints
stuffed into rusting drawers. The other, now owned by an
independent newspaper, the Phnom Penh Post, appears to have been a
government archive. It shows _ very much in the style of communist
nations of the time _ the formal gatherings, the airport greetings
and the posed brigades of workers or soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from daily life, another subject is notably missing from
the Khmer Rouge photography: portraits of the all-powerful leader,
Pol Pot. Unlike Stalin and Mao, he shunned the spotlight, hiding
his identity, changing residences and avoiding photographers.
</P>
<P>
   No weddings, no babies, no birthdays, not even leaders. The only
thorough photographic record kept in the Khmer Rouge years _ and
now its emblematic image _ was Nhem Ein's archive of portraits of
the dead.
</P>
<P>
   It was a time of death and a time of secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secrets were the main thing,'' said Pol Pot's biographer,
David P. Chandler. ``That was something he enjoyed.''

MISSILE DEFENSE: RETHINKING A TREATY FOR A NEW KIND OF ENEMY 
</HEADLINE>
 (The Week in Review)

 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ever since Richard Nixon and Leonid Brezhnev signed
the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 1972, it has been a
cornerstone of arms control. Its fundamental premise, which held
throughout the Cold War, was that limiting missile defenses limited
offensive missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the cornerstone has crumbled a bit.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon announced last week that the threat of a missile
strike from a rogue state like North Korea, Iraq or Iran justified
building a limited national missile defense system _ something
explicitly prohibited by the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   While insisting the United States was not abandoning the
treaty's basic aims, the Clinton administration said it wanted to
start negotiations with the Russians to amend the treaty in ways
that would reflect the emergence of troubling new threats in a
troubling new world.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen even suggested the new threats
had become so great that the United States would reserve its right
to withdraw from the treaty unilaterally if the Russians refused to
consider amendments. While the White House later insisted his
remarks were interpreted too harshly, it was clear that the rules
that have governed arms control for a quarter century had changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the orthodoxy that has driven our policy in the Cold
War needs to be rethought in a world that is much more complex,
that has many and varied threats and that in many ways is much less
stable than the cold war standoff that created the orthodoxy,''
said James Rubin, the State Department's spokesman, who has an
extensive background in arms control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's Iraq or North Korea or the reality of nuclear
explosions in India and Pakistan, we need to hone our
nonproliferation tools to reflect the world we live in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty strictly limited the number,
type and placement of missiles that the United States or the Soviet
Union could deploy to shoot down incoming nuclear missiles. In the
strange logic of nuclear warfare, officials believed that creating
national missile defenses would upset the strategic balance by
encouraging the other side to build more offensive weapons to
overwhelm the defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, who announced that the Pentagon now plans to spend $10.5
billion over the next six years developing a missile defense, said
that logic still held today.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that there is no ABM treaty, then certainly
Russia or other countries would feel free to develop as many
offensive weapons as they wanted, which would then set in motion a
comparable dynamic to offset that with more missiles here,'' Cohen
said.
</P>
<P>
   But he and others said they believed the treaty had enough
flexibility to allow for the sort of limited national missile
defense now being contemplated.

<P>
   A limited defense, they said, need not upset the strategic
balance of power with the Russians since the threats it aims to
counter lie elsewhere _ a notion very close to heresy for arms
controllers of the Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike President Ronald Reagan's vision of a ``Star Wars''
program to build a shield to protect the entire country from
thousands of incoming nuclear missiles, the Pentagon's newest plan
calls for a more modest endeavor. The new defense would use
space-based sensors, early-warning radars and missiles based in
North Dakota or Alaska to shoot down no more than a handful of
missiles from rogue states or terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being reassured, the Russians reacted sharply to the
administration's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We proceed from the assumption that it must not happen,''
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   China, too, joined in criticizing the United States, declaring
that a missile defense ``would only undermine security and
stimulate the proliferation of missiles.''
</P>
<P>
   There are still enormous fiscal and technological obstacles to a
national missile defense. Foremost among them: the Pentagon still
has not proved it can construct a system that will work. And
Clinton has not yet decided to deploy a system.
</P>
<P>
   But clearly the thinking about arms control has evolved as the
world has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Krepon, president of the Henry L. Stimson Center, an
independent research center, said the administration was justified
in considering a limited national missile defense, though deeper
cuts in U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals were also needed.
``Common sense suggests we need limited defenses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Cirincione, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace, an advocacy group in Washington, said he
had profound doubts about the Pentagon's plans, but believed that
arms control treaties should not be impervious to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are in a period where we should be willing to
rethink our treaties,'' he said. ``I don't think there is anything
wrong with the United States saying, if the conditions warrant it,
we should consider changing it. It should be a living document.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ever since Richard Nixon and Leonid Brezhnev signed
the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 1972, it has been a
cornerstone of arms control. Its fundamental premise, which held
throughout the Cold War, was that limiting missile defenses limited
offensive missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the cornerstone has crumbled a bit.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon announced last week that the threat of a missile
strike from a rogue state like North Korea, Iraq or Iran justified
building a limited national missile defense system _ something
explicitly prohibited by the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   While insisting the United States was not abandoning the
treaty's basic aims, the Clinton administration said it wanted to
start negotiations with the Russians to amend the treaty in ways
that would reflect the emergence of troubling new threats in a
troubling new world.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen even suggested the new threats
had become so great that the United States would reserve its right
to withdraw from the treaty unilaterally if the Russians refused to
consider amendments. While the White House later insisted his
remarks were interpreted too harshly, it was clear that the rules
that have governed arms control for a quarter century had changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the orthodoxy that has driven our policy in the Cold
War needs to be rethought in a world that is much more complex,
that has many and varied threats and that in many ways is much less
stable than the cold war standoff that created the orthodoxy,''
said James Rubin, the State Department's spokesman, who has an
extensive background in arms control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's Iraq or North Korea or the reality of nuclear
explosions in India and Pakistan, we need to hone our
nonproliferation tools to reflect the world we live in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty strictly limited the number,
type and placement of missiles that the United States or the Soviet
Union could deploy to shoot down incoming nuclear missiles. In the
strange logic of nuclear warfare, officials believed that creating
national missile defenses would upset the strategic balance by
encouraging the other side to build more offensive weapons to
overwhelm the defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, who announced that the Pentagon now plans to spend $10.5
billion over the next six years developing a missile defense, said
that logic still held today.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that there is no ABM treaty, then certainly
Russia or other countries would feel free to develop as many
offensive weapons as they wanted, which would then set in motion a
comparable dynamic to offset that with more missiles here,'' Cohen
said.
</P>
<P>
   But he and others said they believed the treaty had enough
flexibility to allow for the sort of limited national missile
defense now being contemplated.
</P>
<P>
   A limited defense, they said, need not upset the strategic
balance of power with the Russians since the threats it aims to
counter lie elsewhere _ a notion very close to heresy for arms
controllers of the Cold War era.

ISRAEL'S DIVISIONS SPLINTER ITS POLITICS

   JERUSALEM _ If the rifts in Israeli society could be frozen in
images, the images would be the violent incidents that represent
the fear of what could happen here more routinely if the political
order disintegrated.
</P>
<P>
   For immigrants from the former Soviet Union, the image is that
of Jan Shafsovich, a 22-year-old Israeli soldier stabbed to death
in November in a cafe in Ashkelon for speaking Russian.
</P>
<P>
   For secular Jerusalemites, it is Yitzhak Daniel Levi, an
elderly, wheelchair-bound man whose arms were broken by Hasidic
thugs in December for watching television on the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   And for Jewish settlers in the West Bank, it is Asaf Miara, the
Israeli sergeant dragged from a car in November and pummeled by
Palestinians for driving through Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
   These images, so fresh, are stuck in the public mind here just
as the fragmentation of Israeli society finds new echoes in the
Israeli political system in a way that many feel is dangerous for
the country.
</P>
<P>
   During the four volatile months leading to new elections in May,
the challenge for the system will be to rise above a dysfunctional
body politic; the new Israeli Parliament must be representative
enough to be democratic, and not so representative that it is
dysfunctional itself.
</P>
<P>
   But with the old parties, Labor and Likud, facing identity
crises and new parties forming every day, that is a serious
challenge. The new multi-party system is not only chaotic, making
it difficult to build and sustain a lasting government coalition.
It is also a political expression of something more deep-seated,
what many have called a new tribalism that is eroding the
traditional singleminded unity of an Israeli people devoted to
Zionism above all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel has been reduced to a series of enclaves, as if its
very flesh has been hacked apart,'' David Ohana, a historian, wrote
in his recent book ``The Last Israelis.'' ``Each group speaks in
its code, cordons off its own territory, takes its pound of flesh,
and ``apres moi, le deluge.''
</P>
<P>
   Through its 50 years of life, Israel has been a nation very
demanding of its people. In the army, on kibbutzes and at the tax
collector's office, Israelis have had to give their blood, their
sweat and their cash. The nation was built on a politics of
sacrifice that relied on a cohesive vision, a mission: the
restoration and survival of the Jewish homeland.
</P>
<P>
   But with the prosperity and maturation of the country, and with
every new wave of immigration, that ideological fervor has
diminished. Many immigrants from North Africa and from the former
Soviet Union came because they were fleeing oppression or poverty,
and religious Jews flocked here to live in the Holy Land. All told,
they were refugees, economic migrants and spiritual migrants, not
missionaries for the Jewish homeland as the Zionist pioneers
envisioned it.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, many second- and third-generation Israelis lost the
sense of embattlement that ruled their parents lives. Zionism,
while still important, became less central; the conflict with the
Palestinians grew wearisome.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis began to live as much in their own local, ethnic,
religious and professional communities as in their nation. The
ethnic diversity alone of the population of 6 million is surprising
to outsiders: 20 percent are Sabras, or Israeli-born Jews; 20
percent were born in the former Soviet Union; 20 percent are Arabs;
25 percent are Jews from North Africa and Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
   With greater diversity, there were greater divisions _
religious-secular, Ashkenazi-Sephardic, new immigrant-old
immigrant, Arab-Jewish, Christian Arab-Muslim Arab _ and the
political system began to express them.
</P>
<P>
   There are 11 political parties in the current Knesset, and there
may be 19 in the next one, all skilled at the art of leveraging
their specific interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have the politics of allocation, not of sacrifice,''
said Yaron Ezrahi, a political scientist and fellow of the Israel
Democracy Institute. ``Every group is fighting not for the
collective whole but for its share of the national pie.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Parliament, because of the deep rifts between factions, a
good deal of the battle ends up being showmanship on behalf of an
idea, a people or a way of life, too. While the number of bills
introduced has increased more than a thousandfold in recent years,
the percentage that make it into law is lower than ever _ 8 percent
or 10 percent, Ezrahi said.
</P>
<P>
   Many political analysts see this development as dire. They think
Israel can ill afford to indulge in political theater when huge
issues _ a constitution, borders under a peace agreement, the
separation of religion and state _ remain unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   The two leading candidates for prime minister against the
incumbent, Benjamin Netanyahu of Likud, are obsessed with the
fragmentation of Israeli society.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign of Labor Party leader Ehud Barak is prescriptively
named ``One Israel.'' Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, a popular former general
who is trying to capture the center with a new party, paints an
ugly social portrait of a place where ``people are humiliated every
day because of their origin and attacked because of their beliefs
and way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   On one of Shahak's first campaign ventures, into a marketplace
in Tel Aviv that is a right-wing, working-class Sephardic bastion,
he was pelted with chickens and a death threat: ``The next bullet's
for you,'' he was told. Apologies followed, but there was no
mistaking the animosity that courses through the political veins of
this country.
</P>
<P>
   Shahak was mercilessly mocked when, in his debut political
speech, he called for a new, more civil and compassionate level of
social discourse. Journalists and other politicians jeered as if he
was prescribing a national etiquette program, or asking an entire
nation to get its elbows off the table.
</P>
<P>
   But it is possible that Shahak, with his simple, dire view, was
getting at something deeper than others discuss, even if all of
them talk in similar terms about possible solutions, whether
electoral reform or a unity government.
</P>
<P>
   The optimistic see this moment as a crossroads, a stage that may
force structural changes in Israel's young democracy or a major
political reshuffling to accommodate the new diversity of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   But the worrywarts, who are plentiful, fear that internal
conflict  &UR; is &LR;  the new Israel, and that no political Band-Aid can
cure the deeper wounds.

<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ With the discovery of great energy reserves
in countries around the Caspian Sea, a vast new region has
catapulted onto the world stage. It not only offers oil companies
the prospect of great wealth. It gives outside powers a place to
test their strength.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is waging a strong campaign to win decisive
influence in the Caspian. So are Russia, Iran and other powers in
the region. These grand rivalries have turned the Caspian into the
world's newest stage for big-power politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at the beginning of what will be a massive oil boom,''
said Stanley Escudero, the U.S. ambassador to Azerbaijan. ``It
means that Azerbaijan and this whole region are about to emerge as
major players in the world energy game, and also as a vitally
important area for the whole world.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially the United States supports cooperation in the
Caspian, saying it wants every country except Iran to prosper. Some
U.S. diplomats in the region, however, sense that they are involved
in a modern version of the 19th-century Great Game, in which
Britain and Russia competed for dominance there.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where we prove we're still the big boy on the block,''
said one diplomat. ``China, Europe, Iran, Russia and all the others
want to see if they can take us down. All of our so-called friends
and all of our so-called enemies want control of this region.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's game is being played out in an intense competition for
oil and gas pipeline routes. The nations that win will be able to
help shape events in the region for decades to come.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is lobbying intensely for an oil
pipeline route from Azerbaijan across Georgia and Turkey to the
Mediterranean. This would tie Azerbaijan and Georgia to the West
and be a boon to Turkey, a key NATO ally. U.S. officials are
applying every form of encouragement and pressure they can muster
to persuade oil companies to choose it.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are skeptical. They say the U.S.-backed line is
far too expensive to build without a subsidy of $1 billion or more.
By their calculations, a line across Georgia to the Black Sea would
cost less than half as much.
</P>
<P>
   Since oil companies will pay for whatever pipeline is built,
they are in the catbird seat, and governments in the Caspian area
are fervently wooing them. ``In a reversal of history,'' said
Chevron Overseas Petroleum president Richard Matzke, ``the industry
today is showing its potential to drive geopolitical events, rather
than be driven by them.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, meanwhile, some members of Congress warn that the
United States must be wary of anti-American forces in the Caspian.
They want the Clinton administration to work with the American oil
companies to establish a stronger U.S. presence.
</P>
<P>
   These legislators support bills like the Silk Road Strategy Act
proposed by Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan.; it would finance programs
in the region ranging from support for independent newspapers to
``transfer of excess defense articles.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics counter that the United States should not help Caspian
countries as long as they reject democracy, especially if a hidden
agenda is to smooth the way for big business. Sen. Paul Sarbanes,
D-Md., has suggested that the Silk Road Act be renamed ``the oil
and gas interests bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian leaders are highly suspicious of U.S. ambitions in the
Caspian, which they view as a naked power grab. Russia has
controlled the region for more than a century and is angry at what
it sees as an aggressive U.S. campaign to wrest it away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot help seeing the uproar stirred up in some Western
countries over the energy resources of the Caspian,'' Russian
President Boris Yeltsin told a newspaper interviewer last year.
``Some seek to exclude Russia from the game and undermine its
interests. The so-called `pipeline war' in the region is part of
this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Small amounts of Caspian oil are now being shipped through a
Soviet-era pipeline that runs north from Baku, the Azerbaijani
capital, to the Russian port of Novorossisk on the Black Sea.
Russia proposes that the main export pipeline be built along this
route, rather than across Turkey as the United States wants.
</P>
<P>
   A pipeline across Russia would help keep Caspian nations under
Moscow's thumb. But leaders of new nations in the region are
determined to break free of Russian influence. To do that, they
must have an export route that Russia does not control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be the head of my family,'' reasoned Ahmed Zeynalov,
an Azerbaijani oil executive. ``Would you put your neighbor in the
position of being able to control your family?''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to this political problem, there are practical ones.
The Russian route runs through Chechnya, hardly known for its
stability. And even if Caspian oil can be brought across Russia to
the Black Sea, no one is certain how it would be sent on from
there.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey, suddenly discovering its environmental conscience, says
it cannot bear more tanker traffic through the already crowded
Bosporus to the Mediterranean. Therefore, Turkish officials say,
the only solution is to build a pipeline across their country.
</P>
<P>
   But Bulgaria, Romania and Ukraine are offering an alternative:
send the oil across the Black Sea to our ports and from there to
Western Europe. This option gives oil companies another card to
play when they ask Turkey for billion-dollar subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   In their hearts, many American oil executives believe the best
export route for Caspian oil is through Iran. They cannot choose
that route now because sanctions imposed by Congress forbid large
investments in Iran. But they refuse to write off the idea,
preferring to stall in the hope that the sanctions will collapse.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Sanctions are a drag on our business position,'' said Cecil
Davidson, operations manager in Turkmenistan for Halliburton
International Inc., a supplier of oil and gas equipment. ``The
competition gains strength because of it. They can operate in Iran
and we can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists for American energy companies are pressing for an end
to the sanctions, and some prominent figures in the foreign policy
establishment support them. In a speech this month, former
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance urged new overtures to Iran. Graham
Fuller, a Rand Corp. analyst and former CIA official, recently
called for ``a process of reconciliation'' based on ``a remarkable
number of common interests,'' including Caspian energy.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian officials have begun courting Western oil and gas
companies. ``The route through Iran is the most economical, and the
companies know this,'' said Alireza Bikdeli, Iran's ambassador in
Azerbaijan. ``They know this region very well, perhaps better than
the U.S. government.''
</P>
<P>
   Caspian nations do not share the United States' desire to
isolate Iran. They must live as Iran's neighbors, and would rather
cooperate than feud. ``We'll take into consideration that the
United States opposes routes through Iran,'' said Recepbay Arazov,
the oil and gas minister in Turkmenistan, ``but we're not scared
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Oil executives looking for a way to bring their crude out of
Azerbaijan have only three or four main alternatives. But huge
amounts of oil and gas will also be coming from two countries on
the eastern shore of the Caspian, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan.
Competition there involves a much wider group of players.
</P>
<P>
   Turkmenistan has huge reserves of natural gas, but its only
export pipeline runs through Russia. Because Russia is itself a gas
producer, it refuses to accept competing gas at fair prices. After
a bitter argument in 1997, Turkmenistan turned off its spigot.
</P>
<P>
   Now Turkmenistan has gone more than a year without earning a
cent from its gas reserves, and it has nothing else to sell. The
government is living on bank loans, mostly from Germany. So
President Saparmurat Niyazov is negotiating with Royal/Dutch Shell
to build a $4 billion pipeline across Iran to gas-starved Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy can't wait,'' said Omer Ertur, the chief United
Nations representative in Turkmenistan. ``He's in a financial
crisis. He's up to his neck in debt and he's paying for a series of
colossal projects. If there's no pipeline, there's going to be
instability here.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest of the new Caspian nations, Kazakhstan, is also
hoping to escape from Russia's shadow. Kazakh leaders have approved
the construction of an oil pipeline across Russia to the Black Sea,
but they also want a non-Russian option. They are pushing for a
line under the Caspian to Azerbaijan, from which their oil could be
shipped westward to Georgia and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course Russia will not agree with this project, and will
try to block it,'' said Ermukahmet Ertsybaev, director of the
Kazakhstan Institute of Strategic Studies. ``It would have a huge
political impact. We have been isolated from the world system, and
this would be our link to Europe. It would make our independence
real, and also the independence of Azerbaijan and Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan are also pursuing the idea of
building pipelines eastward to China. These lines would be long and
expensive, but Chinese leaders remain intrigued by them. They know
that a pipeline would pull Central Asia into their sphere of
influence, and guarantee energy sources for continued expansion of
their economy.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the outside powers seeking influence in the Caspian
region are using armies to strengthen their positions. Russia
maintains bases in Georgia and Armenia. The United States has
established a much smaller but nonetheless palpable military
presence.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army has held maneuvers in the region, brought local
officers to America for training, and donated patrol boats and
other military equipment to friendly regimes. In May the Army and
units of the National Guard will stage an international disaster
relief exercise, using computers, in Kazakhstan. Azerbaijan has
signed a defense cooperation agreement with the United States, and
others may follow.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and Iran view these steps as part of a hostile plan to
establish U.S. hegemony over the Caspian. Some American experts,
however, believe there is enough wealth in the region for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things go well, it would be a tremendous boost to all of
the surrounding powers, which are many and formidable,'' said S.
Frederick Starr, chairman of the Central Asia Institute at Johns
Hopkins University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be the best thing that could happen to Russia,
because it would lay to rest their imperial hangover,'' he said.
``It would give Iran its traditional role as a trading state.
Turkey would find a position for itself among peoples with whom it
has a historical connection. China would have a new strategic
connection to the West. Pakistan and India would have chances to
integrate themselves into an emerging region, rather than consume
themselves with mutual hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If things don't go well, there will be a geopolitical vacuum,
which is everywhere dangerous. They invite intrusions, and this is
a highly nuclear neighborhood.''

   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ With the discovery of great energy reserves
in countries around the Caspian Sea, a vast new region has
catapulted onto the world stage. It not only offers oil companies
the prospect of great wealth. It gives outside powers a lace to
test their strength.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is waging a strong campaign to win decisive
influence in the Caspian. So are Russia, Iran and other powers in
the region. These grand rivalries have turned the Caspian into the
world's newest stage for big-power politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at the beginning of what will be a massive oil boom,''
said Stanley Escudero, the U.S. ambassador to Azerbaijan. ``It
means that Azerbaijan and this whole region are about to emerge as
major players in the world energy game, and also as a vitally
important area for the whole world.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially the United States supports cooperation in the
Caspian, saying it wants every country except Iran to prosper. Some
U.S. diplomats in the region, however, sense that they are involved
in a modern version of the 19th-century Great Game, in which
Britain and Russia competed for dominance there.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where we prove we're still the big boy on the block,''
said one diplomat. ``China, Europe, Iran, Russia and all the others
want to see if they can take us down. All of our so-called friends
and all of our so-called enemies want control of this region.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's game is being played out in an intense competition for
oil and gas pipeline routes. The nations that win will be able to
help shape events in the region for decades to come.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is lobbying intensely for an oil
pipeline route from Azerbaijan across Georgia and Turkey to the
Mediterranean. This would tie Azerbaijan and Georgia to the West
and be a boon to Turkey, a key NATO ally. U.S. officials are
applying every form of encouragement and pressure they can muster
to persuade oil companies to choose it.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are skeptical. They say the U.S.-backed line is
far too expensive to build without a subsidy of $1 billion or more.
By their calculations, a line across Georgia to the Black Sea would
cost less than half as much.
</P>
<P>
   Since oil companies will pay for whatever pipeline is built,
they are in the catbird seat, and governments in the Caspian area
are fervently wooing them. ``In a reversal of history,'' said
Chevron Overseas Petroleum president Richard Matzke, ``the industry
today is showing its potential to drive geopolitical events, rather
than be driven by them.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, meanwhile, some members of Congress warn that the
United States must be wary of anti-American forces in the Caspian.
They want the Clinton administration to work with the American oil
companies to establish a stronger U.S. presence.
</P>
<P>
   These legislators support bills like the Silk Road Strategy Act
proposed by Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan.; it would finance programs
in the region ranging from support for independent newspapers to
``transfer of excess defense articles.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics counter that the United States should not help Caspian
countries as long as they reject democracy, especially if a hidden
agenda is to smooth the way for big business. Sen. Paul Sarbanes,
D-Md., has suggested that the Silk Road Act be renamed ``the oil
and gas interests bill.''
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: In meteorology I often hear the terms ``wind
chill'' and ``heat index,'' and I understand what they mean. But
I've been wondering: How do they get these amounts? What operations
are used? _ F. Dacic
</P>
<P>
   A: Welcome to Weather 101 from lecturer, nice guy and
meteorologist Troy Kimmel. The Wind Chill Index (WCI) was developed
in the early 1940s by P.A. Siple and C.F. Passel (refined later by
A. Court) for use by scientists in polar climates. It uses the
current surface air temperature and surface wind speed. The WCI is
based on the fact that as wind blows, heat is removed from bare
skin by the flow of cold air. The Heat Stress Index (HSI), as
developed by R.G. Steadham in the early 1980s, is a real factor to
be considered here in Central Texas. (Anyone remember last summer?)
HSI considers the current surface air temperature along with the
relative humidity. The lower the humidity the more readily moisture
(sweat) will evaporate from the skin. (This process acts as ``air
conditioning'' by keeping the body temperature, through evaporation
and resultant cooling, pretty close to 98.6 degrees F.) Kimmel said
the formulas for determining these numbers are quite complex, but
charts can be accessed on the Internet at
www.srh.noaa.gov/ftproot/fwd/winterwx.htm and
www.srh.noaa.gov/ftproot/ewx/html/heatindex.htm. Q: I live in D.C.
and am in town for a few days. I am trying to find the name of a
book about the provision in the state Constitution which allows
Texas to divide into five states and have 10 U.S. senators. I was
given your name by people at the public library. _M. Lynam
</P>
<P>
   A: Nothing like a real annexation treaty (1845) to plot a novel.
``The Power Exchange,'' by Alan Erwin, was published by Texas
Monthly Press in 1980. At the time, Erwin was chairman of the
Public Utilities Commission. The tale includes a woman governor who
is a constitutional law expert. The annexation treaty of 1845 in
fact gives Texas the ability to divide voluntarily into five
separate states _ a power unique among the 50 states. Care to muse
about what the five states would be? North, South, East, West and .
. . Austin? The capitals? The football teams? The legislatures? New
Texans: Feel the power? Q: Where could I find a copy of the U.S.
Constitution and Bill of Rights, preferably already framed but at
least suitable for framing? _J.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: The first 10 amendments to the Constitution, known as the
Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791. Remember all 10? Order a
copy of the Bill of Rights or the Constitution (``... in order to
form a more perfect union, establish justice ...'') from the
Supreme Court Historical Society at (202) 554-8300. Framed or
unframed, these two documents are big sellers. Other interesting
items sold by the Society? Gavel pencils with two erasers and the
1998 Christmas ornament. The velvet used to make these ornaments is
from the curtains that hung in the courtroom from 1935-1992.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I work at home and am occasionally interrupted by
door-to-door salespeople or those collecting for worthy causes.
Most frequent among my unsolicited doorbell ringers are
well-dressed young men from American Community Services, an
organization said to be working on behalf of gang prevention. These
solicitors are among the most loquacious and smarmy. Is this a
legitimate organization or a scam?
</P>
<P>
   _Chula Sims
</P>
<P>
   A: No solicitation permit under the name American Community
Services is on file with the City of Austin. Without this permit,
the group should not be asking for money. Of course, you could have
the name wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Next time request a pamphlet or flier and ask if the group has a
solicitation permit. Flier in hand, call the charitable
solicitations division of the city clerk's office at 499-2496 to
check. How about a ``No Solicitations'' sign for your door? I never
give money at the door, asking always for printed material to
consider what (if any) donation to make. Turn a deaf ear on the
doorbell and the phone during work hours. If you were at an office,
no one would have answered the door or the phone. Can't go cold
turkey? Set aside several sacred hours when you do not respond to
any interruptions other than business matters.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am having a difficult time locating the Hungarian Embassy.
I have tried the Internet, phone book, etc.
</P>
<P>
   _Laszlo Marton
</P>
<P>
   A: The address is Embassy of the Republic of Hungary, 3910
Shoemaker St., NW, Washington, D.C. 20008. The ambassador is Geza
Jeszenszky. E-mail the embassy at huembwas(at)attmail.com. Q: How
come some U.S. flags have fringe around the perimeter? Does the
color of this fringe have any significant meaning? _R.R.
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Gold fringe is used on the national flag as an honorable
enrichment only,'' says the Institute of Heraldry. Army records
mention this fringe as early as 1835. You tend to see these fringed
flags in parades or on display in offices. It is not customary to
have fringe on flags flying from stationary flagpoles. Q: Why has
the National Weather Service changed to the computer voice on its
current conditions and forecasts? It's terrible. I have heard it in
other cities, too. When ``he'' says ``cloudy'' or ``Abilene,'' my
family laughs and laughs. _Sue F.
</P>
<P>
   A: Your family is not laughing alone. The computerized voice was
installed to save money but, due to consumer complaints, funds have
been authorized to install a new, less humorous, digital voice this
fall, says Robert Robledo, weather service specialist. Wonder how
much they're saving now?!? Think this one will say Burrrrrnet or
BURN-it?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Regarding reflective film installed on the rear window of an
automobile: Now it is bubbling, and it is difficult to see out of
the window. How can you remove it? _Judi Keith
</P>
<P>
   A: Carefully. Rear windows present a problem because they
contain defrosters. You do not want to take a razor blade to this
windshield. Check out the advice from professionals. Spray the back
windshield (inside) with water and attach a black garbage bag. Put
the car in the sun and let the sun heat it up. Within a few hours
you should be able to peel off the tinting. Remove the remaining
glue with Windex or any other ammonia-based window cleaner and,
again, the trusty black bag. Place in the sun and, when heated, use
a plastic (nonstick) scrubber and a terry cloth towel to remove the
glue residue.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you help me find a Stone Cold Steve Austin T-shirt for my
otherwise dainty and delicate 9-year-old granddaughter? She is a
big wrestling fan, and I have not been able to find a shirt in a
child's size medium or large. _C. Burton
</P>
<P>
   A: There is no line of children's shirts for this wrestling
star. How about a small men's shirt, such as the ``Austin 3:16,''
which has a skull and smoking eyes on the back for $25? (I have a
hard time understanding the attraction to wrestling stars.) Would a
cap be more appropriate? To order, call the World Wrestling
Federation ProShop at (815) 734-1156. Sorry, it's not a free call.

influence, and guarantee energy sources for continued expansion of
their economy.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the outside powers seeking influence in the Caspian
region are using armies to strengthen their positions. Russia
maintains bases in Georgia and Armenia. The United States has
established a much smaller but nonetheless palpable military
presence.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army has held maneuvers in the region, brought local
officers to America for training, and donated patrol boats and
other military equipment to friendly regimes. In May the Army and
units of the National Guard will stage an international disaster
relief exercise, using computers, in Kazakhstan. Azerbaijan has
signed a defense cooperation agreement with the United States, and
others may follow.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and Iran view these steps as part of a hostile plan to
establish U.S. hegemony over the Caspian. Some American experts,
however, believe there is enough wealth in the region for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things go well, it would be a tremendous boost to all of
the surrounding powers, which are many and formidable,'' said S.
Frederick Starr, chairman of the Central Asia Institute at Johns
Hopkins University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be the best thing that could happen to Russia,
because it would lay to rest their imperial hangover,'' he said.
``It would give Iran its traditional role as a trading state.
Turkey would find a position for itself among peoples with whom it
has a historical connection. China would have a new strategic
connection to the West. Pakistan and India would have chances to
integrate themselves into an emerging region, rather than consume
themselves with mutual hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If things don't go well, there will be a geopolitical vacuum,
which is everywhere dangerous. They invite intrusions, and this is
a highly nuclear neighborhood.''

   The term ``witch hunt,'' much heard during the past year, is
usually resurrected during cultural wars. With all the current
hyperbole _ ``witches' brew'' was the term used last week by White
House counsel Charles Ruff to describe the charges against
President Clinton in his impeachment trial _ it might be useful to
reflect on the days when a witch hunt was really a hunt for
witches.
</P>
<P>
   Pope Gregory IX established the Inquisition in 1233 to root out
witches, heretics and other agents of Satan, who were believed to
be spreading rapidly throughout Europe to destroy the clerical and
political orders. Thousands were denounced and executed.
</P>
<P>
   Two centuries later, Pope Innocent VIII commissioned a
comprehensive field guide for witch hunters that would remain in
use for two more centuries: ``The Malleus Maleficarum,'' written in
1484 by prominent inquisitors in heresy-riddled Germany. Here are
some excerpts. (The captions have been added by The New York
Times.)
</P>
<P>
   _ JOE SHARKEY
</P>
<P>
   Beware of Smooth-Talking Devils
</P>
<P>
   Although they have a thousand ways of doing harm, and have tried
. . . in every way to subvert and perturb the human race, yet their
power remains confined to the privy parts and the navel. . . .
((Devils)) often lust lecherously after women, and copulate with
them. ((Also, some men are beholden to devils)) who by their magic
charms . . . turn the passions of women to lusts of every kind, and
these criminals are to be thrown to the wild beasts. And the laws
allow that any witness whatsoever is to be admitted as evidence
against them.
</P>
<P>
   Devil-Dating Witches
</P>
<P>
   Concerning witches who copulate with devils. . . . What else is
woman but a foe to friendship, an unescapable punishment, a
necessary evil, a natural temptation, a desirable calamity, a
domestic danger, a delectable detriment, an evil of nature, painted
with fair colors! . . . They have slippery tongues, and are unable
to conceal from their fellow-women those things which by the evil
arts they know.
</P>
<P>
   The Lorena Bobbitt Precedent
</P>
<P>
   What, then, is to be thought of witches who . . . sometimes
collect male organs in great numbers, as many as 20 or 30 members,
and put them in a bird's nest, or shut them up in a box . . . as
has been seen by many and is a matter of common report? . . . For a
certain man tells that, when he had lost his member, he approached
a known witch to ask her to restore it to him. She told the
afflicted man to climb a certain tree, and that he might take which
he liked out of a nest in which there were several members. And
when he tried to take a big one, the witch said: You must not take
that one, adding, because it belonged to a parish priest.
</P>
<P>
   Satan as Unindicted Co-Conspirator
</P>
<P>
   When a woman dips a twig in water and sprinkles the water in the
air to make it rain, although she does not herself cause the rain .
. . yet, because she has entered into a pact with the devil who
causes the rain, she herself nevertheless deservedly bears the
blame, because she is an infidel and does the devil's work,
surrendering herself to his service.
</P>
<P>
   Bad Weather: El Nino or Satan?
</P>
<P>
   In the diocese of Constance ((near)) Salzburg, a violent
hailstorm destroyed all the fruit, crops and vineyards. . . . This
was brought to the notice of the Inquisition ((which determined))
that it was caused by witchcraft. . . . We particularly examined
two women ((who)) were taken and shut up separately in different
prisons. . . . Well-provided with that evil gift of silence which
is the constant bane of judges, although it was in the torture
chamber, ((one of the women)) finally laid bare all the crimes she
had committed.
</P>
<P>
   Witches' Aides and Others
</P>
<P>
   We excommunicate all followers, protectors, defenders and
patrons of ((accused witches)). . . . When any such has been so
sentenced and has scorned to recant his heresy . . . he shall be
considered an outlaw.
</P>
<P>
   Arrest That Tired Old Woman
</P>
<P>
   When a cow's supply of milk has been diminished by witchcraft
((some righteous women)) hang a pail of milk over the fire, and
uttering certain superstitious words, beat the pail with a stick.
And though it is the pail that these women beat, yet the devil
carries all these blows to the back of the witch, and in this way
both the witch and the devil are made weary.
</P>
<P>
   And Your Little Cow, Toto
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes when a cow has been injured [and the authorities) wish
to discover who has bewitched it, they drive it out into the fields
with a man's trousers, or some other unclean thing, upon its head
or back. . . . They beat the cow with a stick and drive it away.
Then the cow runs straight into the house of the witch.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Developing a Network of Informants
</P>
<P>
   Let the process begin with a general citation affixed to the
walls of the parish church or the town hall ((which notice would)
direct, command, require and admonish [reporting to the
Inquisition)) if anyone know, see, or have heard that any person is
reported to be a heretic or a witch.
</P>
<P>
   Spiritual Value of Bad Hair Days
</P>
<P>
   ((Demons)) seem chiefly to molest women and girls with beautiful
hair, either because they devote themselves too much to the care
and adornment of their hair, or because they are wont to excite men
by means of their hair, or because they are boastfully vain about
it . . . Far more women are witches then men . . . yet men are more
often bewitched than women.
</P>
<P>
   Real Men Don't Date Witches
</P>
<P>
   Philocaption, or inordinate love of one person for another, can
be caused in three ways. Sometimes it is due merely to a lack of
control over the eyes; sometimes to the temptation of devils;
sometimes to the spells of necromancers and witches, with the help
of devils. . . . The world is now full of adultery, especially
among the most highly born. . . . Nevertheless, there are still
some strong men cruelly enticed by witches to this sort of love, so
that it would seem they could never restrain themselves from their
inordinate love for them, yet these often most manfully resist the
temptation of lewd and filthy enticements.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal Procedure
</P>
<P>
   All those who are commonly called witches are to be put to
death. . . . Again, it is laid down that they are to be subjected
to questions and tortures, and that none of the faithful are to
associate with them.
</P>
<P>
   The Judge . . . need not require any writ, or demand that the
action (against an accused) should be contested . . . he should
shorten the conduct of the case as much as he can by disallowing
all dilatory exceptions, appeals and obstructions, and the quarrels
of witnesses, and by restraining the superfluous numbers of
witnesses . . .
</P>
<P>
   Because of the great trouble caused by the stubborn silence of
witches, there are several points which the Judge must notice . . .
certain signs. ((For example, many witches vehemently proclaiming
their innocence)) will sooner be torn limb from limb than confess
any of the truth. But torture is not to be neglected for this
reason, for they are not all equally endowed with this power. . . .
Let the accused be stripped ((and)) officers bind her with cords,
and apply her to some engine of torture. . . . Finally, if he sees
that she will not admit her crimes, he shall ask her whether, to
prove her innocence, she is ready to undergo the ordeal by red-hot
iron. And they all desire this, knowing that the devil will prevent
them from hurt. Therefore, a true witch is exposed in this manner.
</P>
<P>
   Pundits, Be Warned
</P>
<P>
   Soothsayers and diviners . . . whose art involves some worship
of or subjection to devils, and who by essay of divination predict
the future or something of that nature which manifestly savours of
heresy are . . . liable to the Inquisitional Court.

 &HT;    Rating rumors on `Star Wars'
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The next installment of the movie series that spans
generations is due for a Memorial Day release. The Internet is
lousy with rumors about plot twists, cameos and dish on ``Star
Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace.'' The February issue of
Yahoo! Internet Life looks into the rumors and tries to sort fact
from fiction.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine rates the rumors on a reliability scale of 1 Artoo
to 4 Artoos, 4 Artoos being the most reliable. ``Artoo'' was the
nickname for R2-D2, one of the series' main mechanical characters.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine, which is on newsstands but can be read online at
http://www.yil.com, also features a collection of useful Web sites
that have nothing to do with the movie. Included is a site called
http://
</P>
<P>
   www.supporthelp.com, which lists tech support numbers for
hardware and software makers, in case you lost yours.
</P>
<P>
   And, in time for Valentine's Day, the magazine takes a look at
online matchmaking sites, most of which are free, including
http://www.swoon.com and http://www.personals.yahoo.com.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the new issue compares whether it's better to do
certain tasks on the Internet instead of the old-fashioned way,
like by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The article looks at fixing a dishwasher, buying office supplies
and renting a foreign film.
</P>
<P>
   Dishwasher repair was determined to be easier using online
support. Some manufacturers' sites have online support information
that list frequently asked answers and give the answers ... so you
can often fix your problem without looking any further.
</P>
<P>
   According to the article, buying office supplies online was more
convenient, but there was little price difference between buying
online and at the store. Going to the video store was considered
the simplest way to rent a foreign firm. The selection at online
sites was better, but the prices were higher and, with shipping,
you had to plan ahead to have Cinema Paradiso in your hands by
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   A pricey PC add-on
</P>
<P>
   Bausch &AMP; Lomb, the folks who sell contact lenses among hundreds
of other optical products, has come up with a new twist on the
computer screen magnifier.
</P>
<P>
   The PC Magni-Viewer is the first acrylic optical lens PC
magnifier. It is designed to reduce the strain on the eyes from
spending too much time at your PC.
</P>
<P>
   The viewer, which sells for $295, magnifies the screen 175
percent. It can be ordered at http://www.bauschvision.com.
</P>
<P>
   The eBooks are coming
</P>
<P>
   A new electronic book, which will retail for about $500, is
expected to be in stores by spring.
</P>
<P>
   NuvoMedia's Rocket eBook will be released by Franklin Electronic
Publishers and sold at electronics retailers, office superstores
and office supply stores.
</P>
<P>
   The eBook is a hand-held receptacle for the electronic version
of books that will be downloaded from the Internet. The electronic
versions of the books will sell for a price comparable to what
printed books cost. There are hundreds of titles available.
Participating publishers include HarperCollins, McGraw-Hill, Random
House and Harvard Business School Press.
</P>
<P>
   The Rocket eBook is 22 ounces. It can hold up to 4,000 pages of
text and graphics at one time. Its batteries last up to 33 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The digital format lets the reader browse, search, annotate,
underline, bookmark, link and reference.
</P>
<P>
   It's tough to beat
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for an indestructible case for your PalmPilot
that's also chic, check out the Titanium Hardcase ($99.99) from
RhinoSkin.
</P>
<P>
   This handsome case uses sheets of folded titanium, a slotted rod
hinge and aircraft rivets, and it has a blasted finish.
</P>
<P>
   It's lined with neoprene rubber padding and has a cut-out area
under the Pilot for stashing money, credit card, ID, etc. The
Hardcase also holds the IBM Workpad but, sadly, not the PalmPC. It
weighs 5.6 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   For those in search of a softer, sportier case with room for
more accessories, look at the RhinoSkin 2000 ($49.95). It will hold
any personal digital assistant or PalmPC, along with a modem,
cables, and other small gear.
</P>
<P>
   Made of tough material, it has a belt loop, a small zipper
pocket, a mesh pocket, battery pockets and a holder for an extra
stylus or ``analog'' pen.
</P>
<P>
   You can learn more at the company's Web site at
http://www.rhinoskin.com or by telephoning 307-734-8833.

 &HT;    Monitor attachment sheds light on eyestrain
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An outfit called One-Tech recently sent me some
material stating ``It has been reported that the No. 1 problem
leading to missed work is eyestrain.'' Along with the promotional
material came a lamp intended to eliminate all this missed work.
</P>
<P>
   The lamp is made in China. Perhaps in China, workers are wont to
call in sick with eyestrain, although given that nation's reported
views on slackers and idlers, I have to doubt it. Here in the
United States, with its enlightened treatment of the working class,
I have never heard of anyone calling in sick with eyestrain.
</P>
<P>
   I have not worked for many places, granted, and the ones for
which I have worked may not have yet emerged from primordial labor
policies, but I don't think I would have much luck calling the
office tomorrow and saying, ``Hey, I can't make it today.
Eyestrain.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not to deny eyes can't be strained by looking at
monitors. I have a friend, a very important one in this operation,
just two cubicles away, who has major problems with glare on his
monitor. To alleviate this, he gets up on a chair, lifts the
ceiling panel over his allotted space, and loosens the light bulb.
With some regularity, a maintenance fellow comes along with a
ladder and tightens the bulb. This arrangement provides exercise
for both men.
</P>
<P>
   Enough about the problem. On to the proposed solution, an
odd-looking lamp called the Eclipse Computer Light.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking the instructions, I might never have figured out how
this little thing works. It sits on top of a monitor with the aid
of a couple of adhesive feet, but this arrangement results in the
base, which contains a fluorescent bulb, pointing up. That's the
way it's supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   Attached to the base is a frame which carries a reflective hood.
This hood can be raised and lowered on the frame, and turned
forward and backward.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is you turn on the light and then adjust the reflector
until the light spills down on the screen and the keyboard. You'll
be sure to do this right away, since otherwise it is reflected
directly into your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   I'll have to admit I was expecting a mere gimmick, but the
Eclipse light actually is very nice. It provides a cool, rather
bluish light that is very pleasant to work around. Being confined
to trifocals, I probably have chronic eyestrain, and I can't say
objectively whether the Eclipse light makes my eyes feel better. I
can only say I like it, and it certainly doesn't produce any glare
that I notice.
</P>
<P>
   The instructions say the light ``provides the proper amount of
the light for the workspace.'' That depends on your definition of
workspace, of course. Certainly it illuminates the monitor and
keyboard just fine. It does not, however, provide sufficient light
to illuminate the entire desk on which my computer sits _ not
enough, at any rate, to read relatively small print comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   The Eclipse light costs $65, including shipping, from One-Tech,
which is located at 23 Acorn St. in Providence, R.I. 02903, and has
a toll-free number, 1-877-ONE-TECH, and a Web site at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .onetech.net.

   WASHINGTON _ Opening arguments have been heard; the Senate has
asked its questions. President Clinton's impeachment trial is now
twisting toward its most unpredictable phase: the decision on
whether to call witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate votes this week to take depositions, the first
step toward public testimony, command performances are expected
from at least three people, Monica Lewinsky, Betty Currie, the
president's personal secretary, and Vernon Jordan, his friend. The
House members who are prosecuting the case would also like to hear
from some White House staff members, like chief of staff John
Podesta and senior aide Sidney Blumenthal. And they want the Senate
to invite the president to testify, though his appearance is
thought to be unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The White House doesn't want witnesses at all. But the
president's lawyers have hinted that if Ms. Lewinsky is summoned,
they may wish to call some witnesses themselves, Linda Tripp, Ms.
Lewinsky's former friend, Lucianne Goldberg, the New York book
agent and Tripp confidante, and maybe even Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel who has been investigating Clinton for nearly
five years.
</P>
<P>
   With all of these potential witnesses having been questioned
already by Starr's office, there is little likelihood that either
side will elicit new evidence from them. The president's lawyers
complained repeatedly last week that Ms. Lewinsky had already been
questioned 22 times and was unlikely to clarify events on a 23rd
try.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, when the impeachment case is boiled down, there is
relatively little conflicting testimony in the record. President
Clinton denied in a deposition last year that he had ``sexual
relations'' with Ms. Lewinsky, but later admitted that they had had
an improper liaison that stopped short of sexual intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, in detailed descriptions to the grand jury of 11
sexual encounters with the president, also said there was no sexual
intercourse, but contradicted Clinton on some details of their
meetings. And Ms. Lewinsky said their sexual affair began in late
1995, while Clinton described a friendship that began in early
1996. Mrs. Currie testified that Ms. Lewinsky asked her to retrieve
gifts the president gave her. Ms. Lewinsky testified that it was
Mrs. Currie who initiated the gift retrieval. But that's about it.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1973 Senate hearings on Watergate, White House
counsel John Dean turned on President Richard M. Nixon and provided
devastating testimony detailing his involvement in a criminal
cover-up. But none of the witnesses likely to be called now _ with
the exception of Mrs. Tripp and Ms. Goldberg _ want to harm
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Even Ms. Lewinsky, who is cooperating with Starr, went out of
her way to tell the grand jury that no one asked her to lie and no
one offered her a job in exchange for her silence, the most serious
obstruction-of-justice charges pending against the president. Her
testimony is more damaging on the perjury charge, but the House
prosecutors have said they don't want to get into sex-saturated
public testimony about who touched whom where.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the prosecutors seem anxious to call witnesses, and the
president's side may respond with its own if it fails to get the
case dismissed. In interviews, four lawyers who have followed the
proceedings assessed the advantages and dangers for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   E. Lawrence Barcella, a Democrat and a former prosecutor, and
Bradford A. Berenson, an admirer of Starr and a white-collar
defense lawyer, agreed that calling witnesses is a bad idea for the
prosecution because most of the likely witnesses will help the
president. ``There's only one reason to call these witnesses,''
Barcella said, ``and that is a general desire to make the president
look smarmy.''
</P>
<P>
   Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., a lawyer at Gibson, Dunn &AMP; Crutcher
who is sympathetic to the House prosecutors, endorsed the calling
of witnesses. ``It seems to me that concluding without witnesses
would stop short of a true resolution,'' he said, ``since both
sides have hinged their cases on the credibility of witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Ben-Veniste, a former Watergate prosecutor and Clinton
defender, said that if there must be witnesses, he would like to
see Mrs. Tripp and Ms. Goldberg called, so that the tangled origins
of the Lewinsky investigation can be clarified for the historical
record. ``Light needs to be cast on the hijacking of the Jones case
and criminalizing of it by Ken Starr,'' he said, referring to the
sexual harassment lawsuit filed against the president by Paula
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   All four lawyers said that if witnesses were called, the most
likely and important were Ms. Lewinsky, Mrs. Currie and Jordan. And
each could be a minefield for one side or the other.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, who would certainly be the star witness, could
help the president more than hurt him, particularly if she
reiterated her grand jury testimony that Clinton had neither told
her to lie nor tried to get her a job in return for lying about
their relationship. But the prosecutors could try to use her
testimony to bolster the perjury case by leading her through the
president's description of the details of their affair, and asking
her if each was true. The point, of course, would be to get her to
say they were false.``That could be powerful in the well of the
Senate,'' Berenson said.
</P>
<P>
   They could also press Ms. Lewinsky on the affidavit she
submitted in the Jones case in an effort to show that she knew it
was false and that Clinton encouraged her to file it. Although the
president may never have directly told Ms. Lewinsky to lie, she
might make it clearer that Clinton encouraged her to deny their
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Betty Currie
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Currie would be second in importance only to Ms. Lewinsky.
Mrs. Currie could help the president's case by reiterating that he
did not instruct her to retrieve gifts, one of the allegations the
prosecutors have emphasized. On this pivotal fact, it could come
down to Mrs. Currie's word against Ms. Lewinsky's, and Mrs. Currie
would probably come across as more credible.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Currie could also help the president on the charge that he
tried to influence her testimony by asking her a series of leading
questions. The president's lawyers could repeat the questions the
president asked Mrs. Currie, and then ask her whether she felt
pressured by him in any way. If she repeated her grand jury
testimony, her answers would be, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   But the House prosecutors could grill Mrs. Currie on her
testimony that Ms. Lewinsky called her about the gifts, and they
could press her on whether she was certain the president had not
discussed the gifts with her. ``You would try to unwind what was
happening,'' Boutrous said, ``find out why she thought she was
retrieving the gifts and why she put them under her bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Vernon Jordan
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has testified that his job assistance to Ms. Lewinsky was
routine, and has adamantly denied any quid pro quo for her
testimony in the Jones lawsuit, so it is unlikely that he would
help the prosecution case, unless the famously unflappable lawyer
seemed nervous or wavering.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the prosecutors could try to rattle him by asking once
again whether his job help was intended to keep Ms. Lewinsky quiet.
``Then you have to look the witness in the eye,'' Boutrous said.
``The senators might see Vernon Jordan struggling with a difficult
question,'' he said, and find his answer unbelievable.

UNDATED: the witch. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Developing a Network of Informants
</P>
<P>
   Let the process begin with a general citation affixed to the
walls of the parish church or the town hall ((which notice would)
direct, command, require and admonish [reporting to the
Inquisition)) if anyone know, see, or have heard that any person is
reported to be a heretic or a witch.
</P>
<P>
   Spiritual Value of Bad Hair Days
</P>
<P>
   ((Demons)) seem chiefly to molest women and girls with beautiful
hair, either because they devote themselves too much to the care
and adornment of their hair, or because they are wont to excite men
by means of their hair, or because they are boastfully vain about
it . . . Far more women are witches then men . . . yet men are more
often bewitched than women.
</P>
<P>
   Real Men Don't Date Witches
</P>
<P>
   Philocaption, or inordinate love of one person for another, can
be caused in three ways. Sometimes it is due merely to a lack of
control over the eyes; sometimes to the temptation of devils;
sometimes to the spells of necromancers and witches, with the help
of devils. . . . The world is now full of adultery, especially
among the most highly born. . . . Nevertheless, there are still
some strong men cruelly enticed by witches to this sort of love, so
that it would seem they could never restrain themselves from their
inordinate love for them, yet these often most manfully resist the
temptation of lewd and filthy enticements.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal Procedure
</P>
<P>
   All those who are commonly called witches are to be put to
death. . . . Again, it is laid down that they are to be subjected
to questions and tortures, and that none of the faithful are to
associate with them.
</P>
<P>
   The Judge . . . need not require any writ, or demand that the
action (against an accused) should be contested . . . he should
shorten the conduct of the case as much as he can by disallowing
all dilatory exceptions, appeals and obstructions, and the quarrels
of witnesses, and by restraining the superfluous numbers of
witnesses . . .
</P>
<P>
   Because of the great trouble caused by the stubborn silence of
witches, there are several points which the Judge must notice . . .
certain signs. ((For example, many witches vehemently proclaiming
their innocence)) will sooner be torn limb from limb than confess
any of the truth. But torture is not to be neglected for this
reason, for they are not all equally endowed with this power. . . .
Let the accused be stripped ((and)) officers bind her with cords,
and apply her to some engine of torture. . . . Finally, if he sees
that she will not admit her crimes, he shall ask her whether, to
prove her innocence, she is ready to undergo the ordeal by red-hot
iron. And they all desire this, knowing that the devil will prevent
them from hurt. Therefore, a true witch is exposed in this manner.
</P>
<P>
   Pundits, Be Warned
</P>
<P>
   Soothsayers and diviners . . . whose art involves some worship
of or subjection to devils, and who by essay of divination predict
the future or something of that nature which manifestly savours of
heresy are . . . liable to the Inquisitional Court.

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ On an evening this March, the ailing, 89-year-old
Elia Kazan, one of America's greatest film and theatrical
directors, is scheduled to receive an honorary Oscar at the 71st
annual Academy Awards. It will not only crown Kazan's career but,
in many ways, spell the end of the tormented legacy of the
Hollywood blacklist.
</P>
<P>
   Kazan was unanimously selected Jan. 7 by the 39-member board of
the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which has given
honorary Oscars in the past to such icons as Buster Keaton,
Satyajit Ray, Greta Garbo, Orson Welles and Akira Kurosawa. What
was surprising about this latest decision, which came after an
impassioned speech by Karl Malden, a long-time Kazan colleague, was
that there was no dissent.
</P>
<P>
   For decades Kazan has symbolized the darkest moment of the
blacklist, when friend informed on friend before the House
Un-American Activities Committee, which was zealously looking for
communist influence in Hollywood. On April 10, 1952, Kazan, a top
Broadway director with an important film career, informed on eight
old friends from the Group Theater who, along with him, had once
belonged to the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lee J. Cobb, Burl Ives, Jerome Robbins and other
prominent entertainment figures also named names, none had quite
the success or fame of Kazan. Nor were they as criticized as he
was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought it was about time to honor him,'' said Malden,
who met Kazan in 1937 when both worked at the Group Theater, and
later starred in ``On the Waterfront'' and other films by Kazan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought there'd be a slugfest,'' he added. ``They all voted
to give him the award.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, angry dissent among some blacklisted
screenwriters over giving an Oscar to Kazan at the March 21
ceremony. But what seems most surprising about the overall response
to the Academy's announcement is how muted it has been. The
emotions and fury that stamped the blacklist days and lingered for
decades finally seem to have faded.
</P>
<P>
   In Kazan's case, his advanced years may be a reason for the
change _ many of his adversaries are dead _ and his extraordinary
record is impossible to ignore. He was the nation's most
significant postwar theatrical director, and his film classics also
include ``A Streetcar Named Desire,'' ``Viva Zapata!'' and ``East
of Eden.''
</P>
<P>
   New debate about the Cold War and a recent spate of books have
also muted opinions about Kazan. New scholarship has persuaded many
people that icons of the left like Alger Hiss and Julius Rosenberg
were probably Soviet spies.
</P>
<P>
   Although adamant that injustice was done in convicting Hiss and
Rosenberg, the writer and editor Victor Navasky acknowledged some
ambivalence about the Kazan award.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, it's a human thing,'' said Navasky, publisher of
The Nation and author of ``Naming Names'' (Viking, 1980), a book
about the Hollywood blacklist. ``He's not physically well and he
made this great cinematic contribution. Second is, with the passage
of time, some of the passions have cooled and things are being put
in a different perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason was the collapse of the Soviet Union, he said,
and the release of archives that tempered many historians' harsh
view of American anti-communism, a new trend. ``There's something
in the air that's a reaction against the historical revisionism of
the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, which said that America was a
contributor to the Cold War, too,'' Navasky said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Navasky and historian Allen Weinstein, who interpret
anti-communism very differently, separately mentioned Dalton
Trumbo, a prominent blacklisted writer, and said that Trumbo summed
up their feelings about the Kazan case. ( Weinstein's current book,
``The Haunted Wood,'' with Alexander Vassiliev, details Soviet
espionage in this country until the early days of the Cold War.)
</P>
<P>
   Trumbo told the Screenwriters Guild's Laurel Awards dinner in
1970 that the blacklist was marked by ``bad faith and good, honesty
and dishonesty, wisdom and stupidity, good and bad on both sides.''
He cautioned the audience not to ``search for villains and heroes
or saints or devils because there were none: there were only
victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Schrecker, a history professor at Yeshiva University and
author of ``Many Are the Crimes: McCarthyism in America'' (Little,
Brown, 1998), which is hostile to anti-communism, said she could
see why Hollywood could honor Kazan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I certainly don't approve of what Kazan did during
the McCarthy period,'' Professor Schrecker said, ``one can maybe
learn a lesson from Bill Clinton and compartmentalize, and separate
Kazan, the informer, and Kazan, the artist.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes Kazan's case complicated, though, seems to be his
personality. After testifying, Kazan took out an ad in The New York
Times justifying his action _ several blacklisted writers still
talk about the ad _ and he remains steadfast in his convictions. In
his ad, the director denounced communism as a ``dangerous and alien
conspiracy,'' and said that ``liberals must speak out.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 1988 memoirs, Kazan said he acted honorably in naming
names and would do so again. He said American communists and their
supporters did not speak out against Stalin's atrocities. ``I
remember those things and I'm glad I was on the other side,'' he
said. Kazan was one of many, including the scholars Edmund Wilson
and Irving Howe, who believed that the Communist Party had a
ruinous effect on film, theater and the wider culture.
</P>
<P>
   Kazan's defenders say it's absurd to say that he personally
destroyed careers because he named names that the committee already
knew.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the hard feelings have not completely disappeared. Walter
Bernstein, author of the memoir, ``Inside Out'' (Knopf 1996), about
his years as a blacklisted screenwriter, said of Kazan: ``The
committee had all the names. They didn't need the names. They
needed  &UR; your &LR;  name. They needed Kazan's name. They needed him. He
made a choice. He did a bad thing. He hurt other people in the
profession. He went over to the side of people who were bigots and
racists and gave them his name and his eminence, which was
considerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Polonsky, another prominent blacklisted writer, spoke
with outrage:``Has he ever said, `Gee, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
done that. I was wrong.' Others have said it. He didn't. If he
said, `I did a bad thing and I'm sorry I did it,' no one would care
anymore!''
</P>
<P>
   But these men are in the minority these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time passes and wounds heal, things lose their passion,'' said
Jeanine Basinger, chairwoman of the Film Studies department at
Wesleyan University, which is curator of Kazan's papers. ``People
look at the mess we have now _ the imperfection in sports heroes,
the imperfection in politicians. Who is anyone to judge how they
would have behaved back then?''

<P>
   Mrs. Currie could also help the president on the charge that he
tried to influence her testimony by asking her a series of leading
questions. The president's lawyers could repeat the questions the
president asked Mrs. Currie, and then ask her whether she felt
pressured by him in any way. If she repeated her grand jury
testimony, her answers would be, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   But the House prosecutors could grill Mrs. Currie on her
testimony that Ms. Lewinsky called her about the gifts, and they
could press her on whether she was certain the president had not
discussed the gifts with her. ``You would try to unwind what was
happening,'' Boutrous said, ``find out why she thought she was
retrieving the gifts and why she put them under her bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Vernon Jordan
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has testified that his job assistance to Ms. Lewinsky was
routine, and has adamantly denied any quid pro quo for her
testimony in the Jones lawsuit, so it is unlikely that he would
help the prosecution case, unless the famously unflappable lawyer
seemed nervous or wavering.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the prosecutors could try to rattle him by asking once
again whether his job help was intended to keep Ms. Lewinsky quiet.
``Then you have to look the witness in the eye,'' Boutrous said.
``The senators might see Vernon Jordan struggling with a difficult
question,'' he said, and find his answer unbelievable.

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ On an evening this March, the ailing, 89-year-old
Elia Kazan, one of America's greatest film and theatrical
directors, is scheduled to receive an honorary Oscar at the 71st
annual Academy Awards. It will not only crown Kazan's career but,
in many ways, spell the end of the tormented legacy of the
Hollywood blacklist.
</P>
<P>
   Kazan was unanimously selected Jan. 7 by the 39-member board of
the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which has given
honorary Oscars in the past to such icons as Buster Keaton,
Satyajit Ray, Greta Garbo, Orson Welles and Akira Kurosawa. What
was surprising about this latest decision, which came after an
impassioned speech by Karl Malden, a long-time Kazan colleague, was
that there was no dissent.
</P>
<P>
   For decades Kazan has symbolized the darkest moment of the
blacklist, when friend informed on friend before the House
Un-American Activities Committee, which was zealously looking for
communist influence in Hollywood. On April 10, 1952, Kazan, a top
Broadway director with an important film career, informed on eight
old friends from the Group Theater who, along with him, had once
belonged to the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lee J. Cobb, Burl Ives, Jerome Robbins and other
prominent entertainment figures also named names, none had quite
the success or fame of Kazan. Nor were they as criticized as he
was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought it was about time to honor him,'' said Malden,
who met Kazan in 1937 when both worked at the Group Theater, and
later starred in ``On the Waterfront'' and other films by Kazan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought there'd be a slugfest,'' he added. ``They all voted
to give him the award.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, angry dissent among some blacklisted
screenwriters over giving an Oscar to Kazan at the March 21
ceremony. But what seems most surprising about the overall response
to the Academy's announcement is how muted it has been. The
emotions and fury that stamped the blacklist days and lingered for
decades finally seem to have faded.
</P>
<P>
   In Kazan's case, his advanced years may be a reason for the
change _ many of his adversaries are dead _ and his extraordinary
record is impossible to ignore. He was the nation's most
significant postwar theatrical director, and his film classics also
include ``A Streetcar Named Desire,'' ``Viva Zapata!'' and ``East
of Eden.''
</P>
<P>
   New debate about the Cold War and a recent spate of books have
also muted opinions about Kazan. New scholarship has persuaded many
people that icons of the left like Alger Hiss and Julius Rosenberg
were probably Soviet spies.
</P>
<P>
   Although adamant that injustice was done in convicting Hiss and
Rosenberg, the writer and editor Victor Navasky acknowledged some
ambivalence about the Kazan award.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, it's a human thing,'' said Navasky, publisher of
The Nation and author of ``Naming Names'' (Viking, 1980), a book
about the Hollywood blacklist. ``He's not physically well and he
made this great cinematic contribution. Second is, with the passage
of time, some of the passions have cooled and things are being put
in a different perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason was the collapse of the Soviet Union, he said,
and the release of archives that tempered many historians' harsh
view of American anti-communism, a new trend. ``There's something
in the air that's a reaction against the historical revisionism of
the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, which said that America was a
contributor to the Cold War, too,'' Navasky said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Navasky and historian Allen Weinstein, who interpret
anti-communism very differently, separately mentioned Dalton
Trumbo, a prominent blacklisted writer, and said that Trumbo summed
up their feelings about the Kazan case. ( Weinstein's current book,
``The Haunted Wood,'' with Alexander Vassiliev, details Soviet
espionage in this country until the early days of the Cold War.)
</P>
<P>
   Trumbo told the Screenwriters Guild's Laurel Awards dinner in
1970 that the blacklist was marked by ``bad faith and good, honesty
and dishonesty, wisdom and stupidity, good and bad on both sides.''
He cautioned the audience not to ``search for villains and heroes
or saints or devils because there were none: there were only
victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Schrecker, a history professor at Yeshiva University and
author of ``Many Are the Crimes: McCarthyism in America'' (Little,
Brown, 1998), which is hostile to anti-communism, said she could
see why Hollywood could honor Kazan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I certainly don't approve of what Kazan did during
the McCarthy period,'' Professor Schrecker said, ``one can maybe
learn a lesson from Bill Clinton and compartmentalize, and separate
Kazan, the informer, and Kazan, the artist.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes Kazan's case complicated, though, seems to be his
personality. After testifying, Kazan took out an ad in The New York
Times justifying his action _ several blacklisted writers still
talk about the ad _ and he remains steadfast in his convictions. In
his ad, the director denounced communism as a ``dangerous and alien
conspiracy,'' and said that ``liberals must speak out.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 1988 memoirs, Kazan said he acted honorably in naming
names and would do so again. He said American communists and their
supporters did not speak out against Stalin's atrocities. ``I
remember those things and I'm glad I was on the other side,'' he
said. Kazan was one of many, including the scholars Edmund Wilson
and Irving Howe, who believed that the Communist Party had a
ruinous effect on film, theater and the wider culture.
</P>
<P>
   Kazan's defenders say it's absurd to say that he personally
destroyed careers because he named names that the committee already
knew.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the hard feelings have not completely disappeared. Walter
Bernstein, author of the memoir, ``Inside Out'' (Knopf 1996), about
his years as a blacklisted screenwriter, said of Kazan: ``The
committee had all the names. They didn't need the names. They
needed  &UR; your &LR;  name. They needed Kazan's name. They needed him. He
made a choice. He did a bad thing. He hurt other people in the
profession. He went over to the side of people who were bigots and
racists and gave them his name and his eminence, which was
considerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Polonsky, another prominent blacklisted writer, spoke
with outrage:``Has he ever said, `Gee, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
done that. I was wrong.' Others have said it. He didn't. If he
said, `I did a bad thing and I'm sorry I did it,' no one would care
anymore!''
</P>
<P>
   But these men are in the minority these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time passes and wounds heal, things lose their passion,'' said
Jeanine Basinger, chairwoman of the Film Studies department at
Wesleyan University, which is curator of Kazan's papers. ``People
look at the mess we have now _ the imperfection in sports heroes,
the imperfection in politicians. Who is anyone to judge how they
would have behaved back then?''

 &HT;    Parents can 'screen' movies beforehand
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Going to the movies is often a family affair. But
since each family has different standards as far as what is
suitable for children, parents have to do a lot of work to make
sure that what's on the screen is suitable for their particular
tastes and preferences.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the Web can come in handy. Many sites rate movies
and offer enough of a plot description to provide guidance before
you plop down $40 or so (once you've paid for the tickets and
bought some popcorn). And even when your expenses are lower,
perhaps just the few dollars it costs to rent a video, these
reviews can save you the inconvenience of watching just part of a
film and deciding it isn't appropriate for your family.
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop today is at a site that specializes in that sort
of information. It's called Kids-in-Mind, Parents Guide to Film and
Video and is located at http://www.kids-in-mind.com/. This site is
exceptionally easy to use, so perhaps even a parent can navigate
the joint. The opening screen offers a capsule review of recently
released films. But you can also find most any film by using the
alphabetical index tabs near the top of the page.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an example of what you might find there. Let's select a
film many people know, ``As Good as It Gets,'' so you can judge the
information in an informed way. Here are edited selections from the
review:
</P>
<P>
   Sex/nudity: A woman is shown from behind wearing only a towel
around her waist.
</P>
<P>
   Violence: There is an intense scene in which a gay man is
brutally beaten by three thugs.
</P>
<P>
   Profanity: Several scatological references, several anatomical
references, several racial and sexual slurs, several mild
obscenities.
</P>
<P>
   The actual review goes into much more detail, but that should
give you an idea of the kind of information you'll get here.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's check out a place called FamilyStyle Movie Guide at
http://www.familystyle.com/. You'll find much of the same type
information here as you did at Kids-in-Mind, but using multiple
sites is useful, since it is helpful to find reviewers that suit
the tastes of your family.
</P>
<P>
   This site also is worth bookmarking for another reason. It
includes a list of 100 great family movies. Think of it as a guide
for exploring really terrific cinema.
</P>
<P>
   We can take a movie from that list to show the sort of
guidelines you'll find here. And it's a movie you are almost sure
to know, ``Casablanca.'' Here's what the site had to say about it,
as far as providing information on whether it would be appropriate
for your family to view as a rental video.
</P>
<P>
   Nudity: None. Sex: None. Violence: very little, shooting, police
raid. Drugs/alcohol: alcohol, some, accepted.
</P>
<P>
   As you can see, there's very little detail here, especially when
compared with our first site. On the other hand, what you do get is
probably sufficient to make a judgment.
</P>
<P>
   And some families will appreciate the fact that details about
drug and alcohol use are included in the review.
</P>
<P>
   Our next site is called Freeze Frame and is located at http://
</P>
<P>
   members.aol.com/freezfram/index2.html. It has a philosophy that
may appeal to some families. Here's how the site describes the way
it rates films:
</P>
<P>
   ``As most of us know ... movie ratings can be deceiving. An
R-rated film may have nothing more than a few scenes of implied
violence, while a PG-13 film may have a several scenes of nudity as
well as volumes of harsh language.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our hope that you use our reviews as a means of
`filtering out' the films you may or may not want to view.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's take a look at what you get here, using a film called
``Buddy.'' That film was shown with a PG rating.
</P>
<P>
   Profanity: ``Oh, my God.'' Sex and Nudity: none. Gore and
Violence: Ape attacks woman.

 &HT;    Apple sees game-playing power as key to expanding home market
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The jazzy iMac, released last August, was Apple's
beachhead in the home market. Now the company plans to expand this
foothold by making the iMac and other Apple computers the best for
playing games.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that entertainment applications drive the home
sales for all electronic gear. For most of its history, Apple's
ignored game developers and saw its share of the home market fall
sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's strategy is twofold. First, it hopes to build the best
hardware on which to run games. That's already under way with the
iMac, built with a super-sharp screen and the microprocessing power
to run today's graphics-intensive games.
</P>
<P>
   This year Apple Computer will further enhance the game-playing
power of its next generation of computers. These machines will
incorporate Silicon Graphics' OpenGL 3-D graphics standard, already
the standard among PCs. That means PC developers, which write most
games, won't have to completely rewrite their code when converting
products to the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer also plans to add Rage 128 graphics accelerator
cards in all upcoming computers. This card will speed up game play
by up to 20 percent, say company engineers.
</P>
<P>
   These recent announcements have been well-received by game
developers, many of whom had abandoned the Mac in the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
   A small but steadily growing number of developers have announced
they will once again publish for the Mac. Among those renewing
their commitment are PopTop Software, Terminal Reality, Epic
MegaGames and the all-important Id Software, maker of ``Quake.''
</P>
<P>
   Games coming to the Mac this year include ``Railroad Tycoon
II,'' ``Fly'' and ``Jazz Jackrabbit 2.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Connectix recently announced it will soon release
software that lets Macs play Sony PlayStation games. About 70
PlayStation titles will be compatible with its new software,
Connectix says.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere was this return to the Mac market better represented
than at the recent MacWorld industry conference, where Id Software
co-founder John Carmack shared the stage with Apple Computer
interim Chief Executive Steve Jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here today because Apple Computer has finally gotten its
act together,'' Carmack told the audience.

 &HT;    Webbys taking a spot among coveted awards
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Look, Web geeks _ an awards show for us!
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone by the Oscars, the Emmys, the Grammys or even
the American Music Awards, the International Academy of Digital
Arts and Sciences (don't ask, we're not sure who they are, either)
has announced nominees for the 1999 Webby Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Webbys are given in 22 categories including Arts, Commerce,
News, Games and our personal favorite, Weird.
</P>
<P>
   A list of the nominees is available at
http://www.webbyawards.com. A large panel of judges ranging from
``Dilbert'' creator Scott Adams to musician David Bowie, along with
Electronic Frontier Foundation pioneer John Perry Barlow and
conservative pundit Arianna Huffington, will pick the winners, to
be announced March 18.
</P>
<P>
   But the real fun of the Webbys _ or any awards show for that
matter _ is handicapping the winners. So put on your virtual formal
wear and let's take a look at this year's nominees.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce category (that's online shopping to regular people)
is pretty much a no-brainer. We have Amazon.com, CDNow, online
auctioneer eBay, the Gap and the Tie Rack (http://www.tierack
</P>
<P>
   .com) battling for top honors. In this category, the Tie Rack is
the equivalent of a foreign film or Disney animated feature getting
tossed into the Best Picture Oscar category. No matter how good it
is, it won't win anything, and it's not that good to start with.
The Gap won't win anything because it has actual stores in the real
world _ good for business, bad for Web awards.
</P>
<P>
   While we'd love to give the Webby to eBay for innovation, sheer
quirkiness and all-around fun, we think Amazon.com will win in a
walk with its combination of easy ordering, overwhelming product
selection and excellent design. Amazon is the only site nominated
in two categories. Its second Webby nod is for technical
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Webbys are a little harder to handicap. Some of
these sites are fairly obscure but worth a look, just to see what
Web taste-makers have lifted above the din to merit-worthy status.
</P>
<P>
   In the Print and Zines category, known quantities Salon and
Slate were both nominated, but so were Feed
(http://www.feedmag.com), an intelligent and intellectual 'zine
from New York, and Nerve, a risque online magazine that tries to
take a literate and intelligent look at love, sex and
relationships. (Warning: This site isn't for everyone and
definitely not for children.) Categories like this illustrate Salon
isn't the only online publication with intelligent writing designed
for intelligent people.
</P>
<P>
   Another interesting category is Sports, where ESPN Sportzone,
one of the most popular sites on the Web, didn't get a nomination
and neither did CBS Sportsline. Nominees in this category include
Quokka Sports (http://www.quokka.com), a beautiful but very odd,
hard-to-navigate Web site that claims to offer viewers an
``interactive sporting experience.'' Also in the Sports category is
SoccerNet (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .soccernet.com) and GolfWeb. The selection here feeds into the
stereotype of Web surfers as a bunch of nerds staring endlessly at
their PCs with a bag of Doritos and a six-pack of soda at the
ready. Lots of neat sports sites like Fastball, FansOnly and a
variety of creative and interesting sites for individual teams were
left off the list.
</P>
<P>
   The Politics category was clearly selected by California
residents, with two sites of California-specific content nominated,
further adding to the myth all Web surfers live in California.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to see what's nominated but don't have the time to
look over every category, take a trip to the nominees in the Arts
category. Each site is an example of outstanding Web design and
innovation. It's a good bet you've never heard of Park Bench
(http://www.cat.nyu.edu/parkbench) and Doors of Perception
(http://www.doorsofperception.com), but they are worth a visit to
discover the Web is a truly creative medium that offers users much
more than one-click ordering.

 &HT;    Consumers land best deals by comparing sales quotes online
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Need it quick. Need it cheap. What can you do for me?
</P>
<P>
   That New Age shopper's refrain, blurted out by nearly everyone
at some time, is being heard and answered daily on the Internet,
the world's fastest-growing bazaar.
</P>
<P>
   Listeners include the transportation industry, with players like
Travelocity, and the book and record distributors like Amazon.com,
Barnes &AMP; Noble and many more.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most intriguing to me personally, however, are the
players that give quotes, such as auto, life and health insurers _
and that classify us in mere seconds based on factual information
about our lives.
</P>
<P>
   They get high marks from the consumer arbiters like Kiplinger
and Money magazine, too.
</P>
<P>
   Benn Konsynski, an Internet commerce specialist at the Goizueta
Business School, put his finger on what's special about Internet
selling by price quote:
</P>
<P>
   ``They give us fast results,'' he said, and they give us the
pleasure of self-service, the feeling ``of letting the customer
choose, or design, the ultimate offer.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, it's empowering.
</P>
<P>
   Just a week ago, I needed tickets to Washington for a personal
business trip. I punched up the Travelocity site
(http://www.travelocity.com), where I was taken by the hand,
invited to request a flight, a car, a room. I got two round-trip
tickets between here and Dulles Airport for just over $400 on
AirTran, a car from Thrifty for $20 a day with no mileage limit,
and the transaction took every bit of 15 minutes. The car rental
price was less than one-way cab fare. Most of the time was consumed
by my price comparing, for airline tickets that ranged from $208 to
nearly $1,000, and car rental prices that ranged from $20 to $55!
</P>
<P>
   The tickets were delivered to my home at 8 the next morning via
Federal Express at no extra charge.
</P>
<P>
   Book distributors like Amazon (http://www.amazon.com) and Barnes
&AMP; Noble (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .barnesandnoble) and others are efficient in putting
best-sellers in our hands fast. But recently I had a special need _
a book that was out of print, the autobiography of the late Carl B.
Stokes, former mayor of Cleveland, that had not been on shelves for
10 years. A used copy of the book was located by Amazon and
delivered in a week.
</P>
<P>
   For people who are still wondering if it is worth it to shell
out $500 for a new 300-megahertz computer, such as the eMachine now
being sold by Office Depot, this is the kind of convenience
Internet users now take for granted. The eMachine, by the way, is a
clone of the popular Apple iMac.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive as Travelocity and sites like it are, I am intrigued
even more by the likes of InstantQuote (http://
</P>
<P>
   www.instantquote.com) or 4autoquotes.com
(http://www.4autoquotes.com/autoinsurancequotes.shtml), where you
say what state you're from, your neighborhood and various personal
information, and you get back car insurance or health or life
insurance quotes from a variety of companies.
</P>
<P>
   Like most, I'd rather endure a diet of bread and water than deal
with certain car or insurance salespeople. Every once in a while
you would like to announce that you want a simple term insurance
policy, perhaps to supplement your company benefit, and you don't
want to hear about all the ``smarter'' and ``newer'' and ``more
comprehensive'' products before getting down to your actual needs.
</P>
<P>
   The computer listens to you and delivers what you ask, or gives
good clues for finding what you want.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, I had that great moment in life that comes to many
people, when you have to disclose to your insurance company that
your teen son will soon be driving the car, and you wonder what
will be the new price of the annual insurance premium. It is a
number you prefer to hear in the privacy of your den, sharp
instruments out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   With quote service, you get within minutes not one shocking
number but a range of answers to the question, letting you know
immediately that there are options, there is room for negotiation,
that you will be able to feed the family and have car insurance
after all.
</P>
<P>
   In my case, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that it was
more cost-effective to remain with my insurer of many years than to
change to a new company.
</P>
<P>
   Konsynski, a professor of information and decision analysis,
says there are several business dynamics at work in the quote-sales
system on the Internet. The databases on which the sales quotes are
made are decades old, but computers put the customer and
information together in dazzling new ways.
</P>
<P>
   Also, some of the systems, in effect, collect consumers and shop
them around among the suppliers, thereby helping airlines fill
empty seats late in the day or week at the best price possible
under the circumstances. It is an auction of sorts. They also use
up the capacity in ways that bring new efficiency to business,
which in the long term produces volume and more favorable prices.
</P>
<P>
   What all of this means or portends is that we will see more such
selling.
</P>
<P>
   It also means new aspects of products can be sold.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in
Washington has produced rather grim but useful tables that show how
likely you are to be killed in your car compared with others should
you accidentally collide with something _ or, to be positive, how
much more or less survivable a crash is in your car. It's at
http://www.hwysafety.org/crash/crashgen/ddr2.htm.
</P>
<P>
   It is an example of discreet information that could well tilt a
sale in a close call, or even provide essential information for
certain buyers. It is an example of the Internet's special power to
find markets and pull them together, however dispersed they may be.

 &HT;    All Music Guide is a virtual library
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Music lovers should check out what many consider the
premier music site on the Web. It's called All Music Guide and
features a library's worth of information about all kinds of
popular music. On the rhythm and blues page, you'll find a listing
of what the Webmaster considers the top three albums of such
masters as Aretha Franklin, Al Green and Otis Redding. You'll find
this site at http://www.allmusic.com.
</P>
<P>
   In print

<P>
   ``Oh my God,'' declares the bright orange headline on the cover
of the January issue of PC Gamer, ``they made a South Park Game!''
It's true. The magazine has a detailed review of this computer game
based on the infamous Comedy Central cartoon. The magazine says
those who enjoy this crude show will not be disappointed. The game
version of ``South Park'' features the same characters and gags as
the show. Not surprisingly, the plot is secondary to the game. And
you won't find guns. But the boys of ``South Park'' are armed to
the hilt with ``action toys.'' They have snowballs, sponge dart
guns and a cow launcher _ among other things _ to fend off killer
turkeys.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Since the success of ``Deer Hunter,'' there's almost nothing you
can't hunt on your computer. The newest additions to the digital
prey are dinosaurs. In WizardWorks' ``Carnivores,'' players hunt
these giant reptiles in a fantasy prehistoric world. Among the prey
you'll find T-Rex, Stegosaurus and Velociraptor. Unlike in other
hunting games, in ``Carnivores'' the hunter can become hunted.
Hunting in this game is more of a death match between you and the
prey. ``Carnivores'' is available only for Windows PCs.
</P>
<P>
   With the new year beginning, some computer users might be
considering taking stock of their financial position. There's some
new software to help you do it. Kiplinger's NetWealth helps you
calculate your net worth, analyze your investments and plan for
retirement, among other things. The CD includes a mutual fund
selector, portfolio manager and college locator. It also includes
video clips of financial advisers and links to more information on
the Web. NetWealth is available only for Windows 95 or 98 PCs.

 &HT;    Rating rumors on `Star Wars'
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The next installment of the movie series that spans
generations is due for a Memorial Day release. The Internet is
lousy with rumors about plot twists, cameos and dish on ``Star
Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace.'' The February issue of
Yahoo! Internet Life looks into the rumors and tries to sort fact
from fiction.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine rates the rumors on a reliability scale of 1 Artoo
to 4 Artoos, 4 Artoos being the most reliable. ``Artoo'' was the
nickname for R2-D2, one of the series' main mechanical characters.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine, which is on newsstands but can be read online at
http://www.yil.com, also features a collection of useful Web sites
that have nothing to do with the movie. Included is a site called
http://
</P>
<P>
   www.supporthelp.com, which lists tech support numbers for
hardware and software makers, in case you lost yours.
</P>
<P>
   And, in time for Valentine's Day, the magazine takes a look at
online matchmaking sites, most of which are free, including
http://www.swoon.com and http://www.personals.yahoo.com.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the new issue compares whether it's better to do
certain tasks on the Internet instead of the old-fashioned way,
like by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The article looks at fixing a dishwasher, buying office supplies
and renting a foreign film.
</P>
<P>
   Dishwasher repair was determined to be easier using online
support. Some manufacturers' sites have online support information
that list frequently asked answers and give the answers ... so you
can often fix your problem without looking any further.
</P>
<P>
   According to the article, buying office supplies online was more
convenient, but there was little price difference between buying
online and at the store. Going to the video store was considered
the simplest way to rent a foreign firm. The selection at online
sites was better, but the prices were higher and, with shipping,
you had to plan ahead to have Cinema Paradiso in your hands by
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   A pricey PC add-on
</P>
<P>
   Bausch &AMP; Lomb, the folks who sell contact lenses among hundreds
of other optical products, has come up with a new twist on the
computer screen magnifier.
</P>
<P>
   The PC Magni-Viewer is the first acrylic optical lens PC
magnifier. It is designed to reduce the strain on the eyes from
spending too much time at your PC.
</P>
<P>
   The viewer, which sells for $295, magnifies the screen 175
percent. It can be ordered at http://www.bauschvision.com.
</P>
<P>
   The eBooks are coming
</P>
<P>
   A new electronic book, which will retail for about $500, is
expected to be in stores by spring.
</P>
<P>
   NuvoMedia's Rocket eBook will be released by Franklin Electronic
Publishers and sold at electronics retailers, office superstores
and office supply stores.
</P>
<P>
   The eBook is a hand-held receptacle for the electronic version
of books that will be downloaded from the Internet. The electronic
versions of the books will sell for a price comparable to what
printed books cost. There are hundreds of titles available.
Participating publishers include HarperCollins, McGraw-Hill, Random
House and Harvard Business School Press.
</P>
<P>
   The Rocket eBook is 22 ounces. It can hold up to 4,000 pages of
text and graphics at one time. Its batteries last up to 33 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The digital format lets the reader browse, search, annotate,
underline, bookmark, link and reference.
</P>
<P>
   It's tough to beat
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for an indestructible case for your PalmPilot
that's also chic, check out the Titanium Hardcase ($99.99) from
RhinoSkin.
</P>
<P>
   This handsome case uses sheets of folded titanium, a slotted rod
hinge and aircraft rivets, and it has a blasted finish.
</P>
<P>
   It's lined with neoprene rubber padding and has a cut-out area
under the Pilot for stashing money, credit card, ID, etc. The
Hardcase also holds the IBM Workpad but, sadly, not the PalmPC. It
weighs 5.6 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   For those in search of a softer, sportier case with room for
more accessories, look at the RhinoSkin 2000 ($49.95). It will hold
any personal digital assistant or PalmPC, along with a modem,
cables, and other small gear.
</P>
<P>
   Made of tough material, it has a belt loop, a small zipper
pocket, a mesh pocket, battery pockets and a holder for an extra
stylus or ``analog'' pen.
</P>
<P>
   You can learn more at the company's Web site at
http://www.rhinoskin.com or by telephoning 307-734-8833.

   UNITED NATIONS _ Around the world the crises pile up, and the
collage of headlines does not make a pretty picture.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, babies die of cold on hillsides where mothers have
fled to save their lives. In Sierra Leone, madmen posing as a rebel
army cut off the hands of teen-aged boys and trap families in their
homes to torch them. Angolans shoot down relief planes. A defiant
Saddam Hussein watches the United Nations drift helplessly without
a policy. Haiti spirals back into chaos. And the chief judge of an
international tribunal is stopped cold at Serbia's border when she
tries to investigate crimes against humanity in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Who's in charge here?
</P>
<P>
   In the last year of the century, the newer, saner world order
confidently anticipated when communism collapsed a decade ago is
nowhere to be seen. International organizations from the United
Nations and NATO to an embattled West African peacekeeping
organization seem powerless. A stream of important people go humbly
to the feet of tyrants _ Saddam, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, Slobodan
Milosevic, Hun Sen _ to beg for a modicum of good behavior.
</P>
<P>
   True, brutality in the last decade has led to some creative
diplomacy, beginning in 1991 with the invention of an arms
inspection system designed to disarm Iraq without bloodshed. But
that system is now on the shelf, along with a host of other ideas.
Remember ``humanitarian intervention'' in Somalia? ``Safe havens''
in Bosnia?
</P>
<P>
   From the vantage point of the United Nations, the United States,
never much of a fan of collective international action, appears to
have retreated even more from an active role in designing
cooperative strategies, as opposed to essentially unilateral ones,
just when Washington's consistent leadership is needed most.
</P>
<P>
   It is a truism at the United Nations that while there may be
many critics of the United States around, there is also a
dependency on Washington to sort things out, to come up with fresh
ideas in an age when old ideologies, beliefs and rules have been
challenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a degree of intellectual and diplomatic laziness has
set in in Washington now that it is not so much the sole remaining
superpower but the supreme power,'' said David Malone, a Canadian
diplomat who recently became president of the International Peace
Academy, an independent organization that works with the United
Nations in studying conflicts and how to resolve them.
</P>
<P>
   Like many scholars who focus on U.S. relations with the United
Nations, and several former secretaries of state who recently spoke
in a private discussion at the Council on Foreign Relations, Malone
says that allowing the coalition that confronted Iraq in 1991 ``to
fall apart in a rather neglectful way'' has weakened the Security
Council. The council is now paralyzed on most issues, not only for
that reason but also because nations like France and Russia have
rediscovered their own interests.
</P>
<P>
   Experts point more directly to what they see as Washington's
failure to work more closely with Russia over the years in drafting
policies on trouble spots where Moscow has some clout and
experience _ Iraq and the former Yugoslavia prime among them.
Russia has also had to put to one side its own requests for more
United Nations involvement in the struggling countries of the
former Soviet Union while Washington got attention for Haiti or
Cuba or other issues important to Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Malone said, however, that caution and withdrawal also mark
other nations' policies. ``In the absence of a willingness to take
certain risks, we will see a situation in which conflicts are
allowed to deteriorate and, in effect, rot until a point where they
are extraordinarily difficult to address, and only then will the
international community be willing to take forceful action,'' he
said. ``We have come to fear very much the threat and use of force,
even in the most noble causes.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is magnified by the characters of the combatants and
of the causes. A great many of today's conflicts are civil wars,
and 100 years of conventions written to make war civilized are
useless pieces of paper in these fights. Ordinary people are the
targets and the fodder of rogue militias. Nine times more civilians
than combatants die. Battles are fought over no apparent
principles, only greed and power.
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF, the U.N. children's fund, reported last week that nearly
50 million children and women are in immediate and extreme danger
worldwide, causing an agency better known for immunization drives
and schoolbooks to rethink its programs in countries where disaster
preparedness may have to be given priority instead.
</P>
<P>
   With international peacekeeping all but dead _ the NATO-led
force in Bosnia is an exception _ armies of relief workers are on
the front lines. But these angels of mercy are cut no slack either.
More aid workers than peacekeeping troops are now dying in the
field. At least 173 U.N. relief officials have been killed in about
five years.
</P>
<P>
   In this ugly new order, brutalizers act with impunity and prove
daily that a peaceful, humane world is not going to be built with
good-governance programs. Force, or a credible threat of force, may
be necessary. Even U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in
Baghdad last February that diplomacy backed by military force was
his recipe for success. Does this sound a little like that old Cold
War slogan, peace through strength?
</P>
<P>
   In the age of cable television and satellite news, dictators get
to watch each other and learn their tactics.

</P>
<P>
   ``I call it the copycat syndrome,'' said Dame Margaret Anstee,
who was the secretary general's special envoy in Angola in the
early 1990s. She said that in 1992, when the rebel leader Jonas
Savimbi ``chose bullets over ballots,'' he had been watching the
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic ``getting away with murder and
the U.N. was not able to deal with the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was convinced,'' she said, ``that Savimbi was sitting in the
bush getting the message: The U.N. is a toothless tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing something about how or what dictators think or
recognizing problems-in-the-making in any number of countries has
not helped in learning how to solve or prevent the problems. And
the longer disasters go on, the harder life is for people trying to
stop them. Peacekeepers and aid workers alike are often criticized
as being part of the problem when their camps and life-saving
services inadvertently provide aid and sometimes cover for one side
in a civil war; aid to Hutu refugees in 1994 in what was then Zaire
offers an example.
</P>
<P>
   ``In internal conflicts, often _ if not always _ helping
civilian populations that live in territory controlled by the
adversary is almost automatically seen as assisting the enemy,''
said Sergio Vieira de Mello, the U.N. undersecretary-general in
charge of emergency relief. ``This is a fundamental change in
contemporary warfare.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer a conflict lasts, the more difficult it becomes for
humanitarian agencies and indeed for peacekeeping operations to
preserve their impartiality and to be seen to be operating in an
impartial manner,'' he said. ``I know no answer to that problem,
except that conflicts should not be allowed to last as long as they
do.''
</P>
<P>
   With relief workers under attack along with civilian populations
_ and the United States and other nations refusing requests to
provide protection for refugee populations, as in Zaire from 1994

   ``When we have access, seldom do we have the means of providing
these groups with something that is more important than assistance,

eventually are killed _ is something that we have been grappling
with for many years now.''

international lawyer who directs migration projects at the Open

interest or the perception of self interest.'' Conflicts, he added,
now ride on causes that are ``regional, subregional, even to the
point of clans _ the atomization of societies.''
</P>
<P>
   Small ideas. Big egos. War in Africa. Butchery in the Balkans.
Not to mention a resilient American optimism that blots out

 &HT;    Monitor attachment sheds light on eyestrain
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An outfit called One-Tech recently sent me some
material stating ``It has been reported that the No. 1 problem
leading to missed work is eyestrain.'' Along with the promotional
material came a lamp intended to eliminate all this missed work.
</P>
<P>
   The lamp is made in China. Perhaps in China, workers are wont to
call in sick with eyestrain, although given that nation's reported
views on slackers and idlers, I have to doubt it. Here in the
United States, with its enlightened treatment of the working class,
I have never heard of anyone calling in sick with eyestrain.
</P>
<P>
   I have not worked for many places, granted, and the ones for
which I have worked may not have yet emerged from primordial labor
policies, but I don't think I would have much luck calling the
office tomorrow and saying, ``Hey, I can't make it today.
Eyestrain.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not to deny eyes can't be strained by looking at
monitors. I have a friend, a very important one in this operation,
just two cubicles away, who has major problems with glare on his
monitor. To alleviate this, he gets up on a chair, lifts the
ceiling panel over his allotted space, and loosens the light bulb.
With some regularity, a maintenance fellow comes along with a
ladder and tightens the bulb. This arrangement provides exercise
for both men.
</P>
<P>
   Enough about the problem. On to the proposed solution, an
odd-looking lamp called the Eclipse Computer Light.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking the instructions, I might never have figured out how
this little thing works. It sits on top of a monitor with the aid
of a couple of adhesive feet, but this arrangement results in the
base, which contains a fluorescent bulb, pointing up. That's the
way it's supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   Attached to the base is a frame which carries a reflective hood.
This hood can be raised and lowered on the frame, and turned
forward and backward.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is you turn on the light and then adjust the reflector
until the light spills down on the screen and the keyboard. You'll
be sure to do this right away, since otherwise it is reflected
directly into your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   I'll have to admit I was expecting a mere gimmick, but the
Eclipse light actually is very nice. It provides a cool, rather
bluish light that is very pleasant to work around. Being confined
to trifocals, I probably have chronic eyestrain, and I can't say
objectively whether the Eclipse light makes my eyes feel better. I
can only say I like it, and it certainly doesn't produce any glare
that I notice.
</P>
<P>
   The instructions say the light ``provides the proper amount of
the light for the workspace.'' That depends on your definition of
workspace, of course. Certainly it illuminates the monitor and
keyboard just fine. It does not, however, provide sufficient light
to illuminate the entire desk on which my computer sits _ not
enough, at any rate, to read relatively small print comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   The Eclipse light costs $65, including shipping, from One-Tech,
which is located at 23 Acorn St. in Providence, R.I. 02903, and has
a toll-free number, 1-877-ONE-TECH, and a Web site at http://www

UNITED NATIONS: their tactics. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I call it the copycat syndrome,'' said Dame Margaret Anstee,
who was the secretary general's special envoy in Angola in the
early 1990s. She said that in 1992, when the rebel leader Jonas
Savimbi ``chose bullets over ballots,'' he had been watching the
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic ``getting away with murder and
the U.N. was not able to deal with the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was convinced,'' she said, ``that Savimbi was sitting in the
bush getting the message: The U.N. is a toothless tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing something about how or what dictators think or
recognizing problems-in-the-making in any number of countries has
not helped in learning how to solve or prevent the problems. And
the longer disasters go on, the harder life is for people trying to
stop them. Peacekeepers and aid workers alike are often criticized
as being part of the problem when their camps and life-saving
services inadvertently provide aid and sometimes cover for one side
in a civil war; aid to Hutu refugees in 1994 in what was then Zaire
offers an example.
</P>
<P>
   ``In internal conflicts, often _ if not always _ helping
civilian populations that live in territory controlled by the
adversary is almost automatically seen as assisting the enemy,''
said Sergio Vieira de Mello, the U.N. undersecretary-general in
charge of emergency relief. ``This is a fundamental change in
contemporary warfare.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer a conflict lasts, the more difficult it becomes for
humanitarian agencies and indeed for peacekeeping operations to
preserve their impartiality and to be seen to be operating in an
impartial manner,'' he said. ``I know no answer to that problem,
except that conflicts should not be allowed to last as long as they
do.''
</P>
<P>
   With relief workers under attack along with civilian populations
_ and the United States and other nations refusing requests to
provide protection for refugee populations, as in Zaire from 1994
to 1997 _ the aid agencies face a catastrophic dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have access, seldom do we have the means of providing
these groups with something that is more important than assistance,
which is protection,'' de Mello said. ``Therefore the specter of
the well-fed dead _ those we feed but are unable to protect and
eventually are killed _ is something that we have been grappling
with for many years now.''
</P>
<P>
   The new world order is an environment without ideologies, which
however flawed may have at least provided symbols and ennobling
motivations in past conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideas are much smaller now,'' said Arthur Helton, an

deep identity crises and new parties constantly forming, Israel is
producing a new multi-party system that is chaotic and will make it
difficult to build and sustain a lasting government coalition. But
the trend is a political expression of something more deepseated,

   MISSILES-REVIEW (Washington) _ Ever since Richard Nixon and
Leonid Brezhnev signed it in 1972, the Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty has been one of the cornerstones of arms control. Its

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It seemed like a good idea to U.S. Customs Service
officials, no doubt. When Customs inspectors became suspicious that
someone was trying to smuggle drugs or other contraband into the
country, they would offer a choice: a conventional strip-search or
an X-ray.
</P>
<P>
   For innocent travelers, an X-ray would be less degrading than a
strip-search by a stranger in uniform. And for Customs inspectors,
it would be easier to discover drugs, cash or other illicit goods
hidden beneath travelers' clothing or even inside their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   But, as sometimes happens with good ideas, the reality did not
match the hope. The Customs Service began offering foreign visitors
and returning Americans the X-ray option last October at two major
airports, John F. Kennedy in New York City and Miami International
in Florida. In the first three months of the experiment, nine
people at Kennedy and eight in Miami were offered the choice of an
X-ray. No one accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Customs Service are not sure why their offer
was rejected so resoundingly, but they have some theories. Drug
couriers who are carrying narcotics internally, usually by
swallowing condoms containing heroin, would surely want to avoid
detection through an X-ray. Innocent tourists might have chosen the
humiliation of a strip-search because they feared the health
consequences of an unnecessary X-ray.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the factor of sheer inconvenience: The X-ray
machines were not in the airports' arrivals buildings, but in their
medical centers. Travelers who opt for an X-ray would have to be
driven, in handcuffs, from the Customs Service's inspection areas
to the medical centers.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-day test of X-rays was scheduled to end in mid-January,
but officials have decided to press on. They say they are
determined to find a way to examine tourists and returning
Americans without the tension and unpleasantness of a strip-search.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to keep the option going,'' said Raymond Kelly,
commissioner of the Customs Service and a former New York City
police commissioner. ``I want the concept to stay alive.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Kelly said, it was relatively easy to spot drug
smugglers arriving at airports. But because of the traffickers'
greater sophistication, inspectors find themselves guessing wrong
and searching a growing proportion of innocent travelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is mitigate as much as possible the
unpleasantness of a full-blown strip-search,'' Kelly said. ``This
is an unpleasant experience for the inspectors and for the people
who are being examined.''
</P>
<P>
   So Kelly and his agency are now gearing up for round two of the
X-ray experiment. Contractors have installed new body scan machines
in Miami and at Kennedy that produce images of anything between a
traveler's clothing and skin. This scan exposes people to far less
radiation than a traditional X-ray, which penetrates body organs.
It will also be much more convenient than X-rays have proved to be.
The new machines are being tested next to the Customs Service's
inspection areas, near the arrival gates. They are likely to be in
use in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 million people pass through customs at airports,
seaports and border crossings each year, and the overwhelming
majority receive only a cursory look at their documents and
luggage.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,700 people were strip-searched by inspectors last year,
Customs officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some civil liberties lawyers are raising questions
about the idea of taking X-rays of people entering the country _ on
grounds both aesthetic and legal. They noted that the sight of an
X-ray or a body-scan machine upon entering the United States was
not quite as welcoming or poetic as the greeting the Statue of
Liberty offered to generations of visitors: ``Give me your tired,
your poor, your huddled masses. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, said he is concerned that the use of X-rays ``will
result in the government obtaining more information about people
that they do not have any interest in knowing about.''
</P>
<P>
   Siegel, whose office has received no complaints about the X-ray
option, said he would want to know whether the federal agency
intended to keep copies of X-rays or body scans of innocent
travelers and whether these images would be retained in a database.
He also questioned the possible health consequences of taking an
X-ray that was not needed for medical purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said the inspectors would destroy the X-rays. ``We're not
interested in collecting medical evidence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Siegel said his office would monitor the Customs Service's
innovations. He said he was concerned that, because an X-ray or
body scan seems less intrusive than a strip-search, it might one
day become routine, in the process ``transforming entrance into the
United States into a general search.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is a commentary on how we're changing,'' Siegel
said. ``Drugs are a serious issue, but from our perspective, it
would be better if there were at least a public discussion about
these things.''

   MEXICO CITY _ In a country where, according to some estimates,
up to 60 percent of the people are poor, and in a region with the
world's most inequitable distribution of income, Pope John Paul
II's trip to Mexico and Latin America this week will inevitably
sharpen the debate on the role of the Roman Catholic Church in
combating poverty and inequality.
</P>
<P>
   From Fray Bartolome de las Casas's defense of the indigenous
peoples of New Spain in the 16th century through the emergence of
liberation theology in the 1960s and 1970s, the Latin American
coincidence of a powerful church and widespread destitution and
inequity has led to unending acrimony.
</P>
<P>
   If in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union John Paul's
discourse and practice were consistent and unwavering, in Latin
America his stances over the past two decades have been ambivalent.
Like other foreign travelers for centuries, John Paul II has been
dismayed by his encounter with sheer misery, violence and
injustice: Through the Caribbean and Central America, across
northeastern Brazil, in the shantytowns outside Mexico City, he was
appalled by crowded conditions, pervasive corruption, drugs and
prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   No sensitive visitor could react otherwise; his attacks on
unfettered global capitalism and ``neo-liberalism'' are to some
extent a consequence of his travels.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the pope has dismantled and dispersed the
scant defenders of Latin America's poor. Whatever one may think of
the ideas and tactics espoused by thousands of priests and lay
church workers _ all lumped together as liberation theologists _
for many years they were a voice for the voiceless where repression
or silence was the norm.
</P>
<P>
   Bishops have been transferred and seminaries shut down;
appointments in Mexico, Brazil, Peru and elsewhere have tended to
restore the Latin American church to what its critics said it had
traditionally been: an institution of the rich, for the rich, by
the rich.
</P>
<P>
   The dismantling of the progressive dioceses in Sao Paulo and
many of its anti-poverty initiatives, as well as the pope's recent
slashing criticism of the bishop in the Mexican state of Chiapas
for his ``indigenist'' theology, are examples of this trend.
</P>
<P>
   So while John Paul II has issued scathing attacks on the
widening gaps between rich and poor, between ethnic groups and men
and women, he has also helped to make any concerted effort to
alleviate these ills far more difficult. Even the one area where he
could have placed himself above the left-right fray and played a
lasting role in diminishing poverty and inequality fell prey to his
innate ecclesiastical conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   Population growth in Latin America has been dropping for two
decades, but nowhere near rapidly enough to provide basic services
and social rights to millions of underprivileged people. The fall
in fertility rates is unevenly distributed: Young women in the
poorest rural areas or urban slums have several times more children
than middle-class or affluent women.
</P>
<P>
   While the church under John Paul has ceased opposing family
planning efforts in most nations in the hemisphere, it has
certainly not been a force for change on this crucial problem. In
the 20 years he has been pope, the region's population,
overwhelmingly Catholic, has risen to nearly 500 million from 335
million.
</P>
<P>
   While speaking up against Latin America's ancestral scourges,
Pope John Paul has silenced some of the most eloquent voices of the
very dispossessed he has devoted so much time to. This
contradiction will be part of his legacy.

   NEW YORK _ It seemed like a good idea to U.S. Customs Service
officials, no doubt. When Customs inspectors became suspicious that
someone was trying to smuggle drugs or other contraband into the
country, they would offer a choice: a conventional strip-search or
an X-ray.
</P>
<P>
   For innocent travelers, an X-ray would be less degrading than a
strip-search by a stranger in uniform. And for Customs inspectors,
it would be easier to discover drugs, cash or other illicit goods
hidden beneath travelers' clothing or even inside their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   But, as sometimes happens with good ideas, the reality did not
match the hope. The Customs Service began offering foreign visitors
and returning Americans the X-ray option last October at two major
airports, John F. Kennedy in New York City and Miami International
in Florida. In the first three months of the experiment, nine
people at Kennedy and eight in Miami were offered the choice of an
X-ray. No one accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Customs Service are not sure why their offer
was rejected so resoundingly, but they have some theories. Drug
couriers who are carrying narcotics internally, usually by
swallowing condoms containing heroin, would surely want to avoid
detection through an X-ray. Innocent tourists might have chosen the
humiliation of a strip-search because they feared the health
consequences of an unnecessary X-ray.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the factor of sheer inconvenience: The X-ray
machines were not in the airports' arrivals buildings, but in their
medical centers. Travelers who opt for an X-ray would have to be
driven, in handcuffs, from the Customs Service's inspection areas
to the medical centers.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-day test of X-rays was scheduled to end in mid-January,
but officials have decided to press on. They say they are
determined to find a way to examine tourists and returning
Americans without the tension and unpleasantness of a strip-search.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to keep the option going,'' said Raymond Kelly,
commissioner of the Customs Service and a former New York City
police commissioner. ``I want the concept to stay alive.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Kelly said, it was relatively easy to spot drug
smugglers arriving at airports. But because of the traffickers'
greater sophistication, inspectors find themselves guessing wrong
and searching a growing proportion of innocent travelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is mitigate as much as possible the
unpleasantness of a full-blown strip-search,'' Kelly said. ``This
is an unpleasant experience for the inspectors and for the people
who are being examined.''
</P>
<P>
   So Kelly and his agency are now gearing up for round two of the
X-ray experiment. Contractors have installed new body scan machines
in Miami and at Kennedy that produce images of anything between a
traveler's clothing and skin. This scan exposes people to far less
radiation than a traditional X-ray, which penetrates body organs.
It will also be much more convenient than X-rays have proved to be.
The new machines are being tested next to the Customs Service's
inspection areas, near the arrival gates. They are likely to be in
use in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 million people pass through customs at airports,
seaports and border crossings each year, and the overwhelming
majority receive only a cursory look at their documents and
luggage.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,700 people were strip-searched by inspectors last year,
Customs officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some civil liberties lawyers are raising questions
about the idea of taking X-rays of people entering the country _ on
grounds both aesthetic and legal. They noted that the sight of an
X-ray or a body-scan machine upon entering the United States was
not quite as welcoming or poetic as the greeting the Statue of
Liberty offered to generations of visitors: ``Give me your tired,
your poor, your huddled masses. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, said he is concerned that the use of X-rays ``will
result in the government obtaining more information about people
that they do not have any interest in knowing about.''
</P>
<P>
   Siegel, whose office has received no complaints about the X-ray
option, said he would want to know whether the federal agency
intended to keep copies of X-rays or body scans of innocent
travelers and whether these images would be retained in a database.
He also questioned the possible health consequences of taking an
X-ray that was not needed for medical purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said the inspectors would destroy the X-rays. ``We're not
interested in collecting medical evidence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Siegel said his office would monitor the Customs Service's
innovations. He said he was concerned that, because an X-ray or
body scan seems less intrusive than a strip-search, it might one
day become routine, in the process ``transforming entrance into the
United States into a general search.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is a commentary on how we're changing,'' Siegel
said. ``Drugs are a serious issue, but from our perspective, it
would be better if there were at least a public discussion about
these things.''

 &HT;    Pastors try to focus on salvation, not politics
 &HT;    By Kim Sue Lia Perkes
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Pastors are trained to offer spiritual guidance,
comfort to the sick and a helping hand to the fallen, but divinity
school doesn't prepare them for politicians in the pews.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is not to tell anyone, politicians or otherwise, what I
think they might want to hear,'' said the Rev. Chuck Merrill,
pastor of University United Methodist Church, home to several
judges and Austin Mayor Kirk Watson.
</P>
<P>
   While most pastors say they minister to politicians in the same
way they do to other members of the flock, these preachers can find
themselves thrust under a media microscope and targeted for attack
by other religious leaders. Almost daily, President Clinton's
religious advisers are clubbed with criticisms by conservative
preachers who have labeled them spiritual enablers dispensing cheap
grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``My secretary remarked the other day, `Phil, you are developing
the hide of a rhinoceros,' '' said the Rev. J. Philip Wogaman,
pastor of Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington D.C., where
the Clintons attend church.
</P>
<P>
   Church attendance at Riverbend Church in Austin plummeted by 500
people after the church's pastor, Rev. Gerald Mann, prayed for and
comforted Clinton when the president apologized for his sexual
transgression with Monica Lewinsky at the National Prayer Breakfast
in September. ``We had one major contributor leave the church over
it,'' Mann said. ``He thought my standing there and praying by the
president was tantamount to approving of his behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Weekly church attendance is back up to 4,000, he added. Mann,
who serves as chaplain for the Texas House of Representatives,
continues to counsel Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Billy Graham, who has counseled numerous presidents,
including Lyndon Baines Johnson and George Bush, has taken his
share of hits over the years. His close association with Richard
Nixon, a Quaker, who resigned the presidency after the Watergate
scandal, drew the ire of many. Graham urged Gerald Ford to pardon
Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Just As I Am: The Autobiography of Billy Graham,''
the evangelist talks about the harsh criticism he received from
conservative Christians for offering the inauguration prayer for
Clinton in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Graham writes in the book, released before Clinton's sexual
entanglement became public, that ``no president stands outside the
need for God's constant help and guidance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is one reason I have always agreed to lead prayers on
such occasions when asked,'' Graham continued. ``Furthermore, the
Scripture commands us to pray `for kings and all those in authority
that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and
holiness. This is good and pleases God our Savior.' (1 Timothy
2:2-3).
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked one person who tried to dissuade me, `Are you saying
you don't think Mr. Clinton needs our prayers, or that we shouldn't
pray for him?' '' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   Graham also prayed at Clinton's 1996 inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   Though it may appear that some ministers spend more time with
their celebrity politicians than with others in the pews, Mayfield
points out that every pastor spends more time with those in need.
</P>
<P>
   A pastor is like the parent of a large family, Mayfield said.
``When you're a parent, you know your energy goes to the child that
needs it.''
</P>
<P>
   And your sermons need to hit home, Merrill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are in public service, you have to be reminded that
God's word is about mercy and justice. If you don't want to hear
that, you need to go somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes political figures do that. Bob and Elizabeth Dole
bolted from Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington, D.C., in
1995 after political columnists began scrutinizing the church and
Wogaman during the last presidential campaign. What interested the
media was that Clinton, a Southern Baptist, and his wife, Hillary,
a Methodist, attend the same church.
</P>
<P>
   The church is a ``reconciling'' congregation, the label given
Methodist congregations that openly welcome gays and lesbians to
worship. Wogaman's sermons were picked apart, with some
conservative political pundits branding him a socialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have resolutely declined to reveal what my party affiliation
is,'' Wogaman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do what you think is the right thing and let the chips
fall where they will. Given enough time, everybody becomes
anonymous.''
</P>
<P>
   Wogaman has written a book, ``From the Eye of the Storm: A
Pastor to the President Speaks Out,'' that deals with the spiritual
state of the nation and Clinton. The book, released last month,
paints a picture of a nation at a crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be sure, love and law are not necessarily inconsistent or
incompatible,'' Wogaman writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it matters, perhaps a whole lot, which of the two is
understood to be the foundation of our life together as a people.
If law comes first, then love is subordinated. If love comes first,
then law is there to serve community . . . It should be no secret
that I am among those who place the greater emphasis upon community
and love.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Ralph Smith, pastor emeritus of Hyde Park Baptist
Church in Austin, said the way he sees it is he thinks the country
has gotten so far away from morality that an immoral act seems
normal. ``It's a commentary on our society,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he was fortunate when former Texas Gov. Mark White
attended his church.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Sunday, you occasionally had disruptions,'' he said.
``Mostly, people who wanted to be in church when the governor was
in church. One demented woman always wanted to sit next to him. He
would let her come up and sit by him.''
</P>
<P>
   His biggest hassle, Smith said, was the telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get the phone calls from people that want the governor to
do something they want done or for some favor they want,'' Smith
recalled. ``You have to say: `Look, I have nothing to do with that.
I told the governor I wouldn't try to be the governor, and he told
me he wouldn't try to preach for me.' I referred them all to the
governor's office. I had the number memorized.''
</P>

REPUBLICANS MOCK THE PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The most salient contribution made by former Sen.
Dale Bumpers of Arkansas to the defense of President Clinton at his
impeachment trial was not the injection of the country lawyer
folksiness, although that was a welcome change from the
buttoned-down types who otherwise dominated the disputation.
</P>
<P>
   Neither was it Bumpers' emphatic and emotional evocation of the
historical context of the events in the Senate, though his words
gave it a significance more intense than when other defenders of
the president advanced the same arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was it Bumpers's singularity in speaking to the human costs
Clinton's escapades had exacted from the Clinton family, though no
one else had presumed to speak of it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there was concern expressed mostly off the Senate floor
that Clinton should not be allowed to ``get away with it,'' as if
what he had done to his wife and daughter would not forever scar
their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   No, not for all these pointed insights was Dale Bumpers the most
cogent contributor to last week's oratory, but for yet another
observation that gave the transpiring events the context for which
they cried out. This came when Bumpers turned to face the House
prosecutors, whom he had addressed in terms of almost courtly
courtesy even as he disdained their efforts against his friend, the
president of the United States. He said in a passage that went to
the heart of the matter:
</P>
<P>
   ``This is intended only as a mild criticism of our distinguished
friends from the House. But as I listened to the presenters, the
managers, they were remarkably well-prepared, and they spoke
eloquently, more eloquently than I really had hoped. But when I
talk about the human element, I talk about what I thought was, on
occasion, unnecessarily harsh and pejorative description of the
president. I thought that the language should have been tempered
somewhat to acknowledge that he is president...''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in the torrent of verbiage undammed last week, someone
got to the point. The Republican prosecutors throughout have been
relentless in their lack of respect for the presidency, their
occasional pro-forma remarks in passing to the contrary
notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   That disrespect was dramatically illustrated in the tenor of the
questions with which the lawyers for Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr bombarded the president during his grand jury appearance. The
American people got to see and hear for themselves the goading
tonality with which they assailed the witness, who after all was
then and remains still the president.
</P>
<P>
   The contemptuousness that they didn't even try to disguise
manifested itself again when the House Judiciary Committee issued
its 81 questions to the president, and demanded that he answer yes
or no. The questions themselves were framed in such a manner that
they recalled the old saw about ``When did you stop beating your
wife?''
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton refused to permit political pressure to force him
to play along with their bullying, the Republican members of the
House Judiciary Committee wanted him impeached for his impudence,
as they construed it. In this, they overplayed their hand, because
the full House refused to go along with this gambit, rejecting that
article of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   And so it has progressed in the rhetoric of the House
prosecutors as they presented their case to the Senate, and as
Bumpers identified for what it was. The Republicans don't even
bother to pretend. Arguably this might be tolerable treatment for a
president who had repeatedly undermined the precepts of the
Constitution, as did Richard Nixon, or who had in effect dealt with
the enemy, as did Ronald Reagan with Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Yet neither of these presidents had to deal with the kind of
dismissive language that so easily emanates from Clinton's
chattering prosecutors. Which demonstrates that they think that
offenses committed covering up an illicit sexual affair outweighs
marshalling the FBI and CIA and IRS against one's political
enemies, or selling missiles to a nation that was publicly
denounced an intransigent foe.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Clinton's offenses are what the Republicans claim, they
don't fall into the same class as Nixon's or Reagan's, or Lyndon
Johnson's for his lies that shoved the United States into an
extended bloody war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, their arguments should have been made in terms of
reluctant regret, a necessity forced on them in order to protect
the Republic.
</P>
<P>
   They should have been hospitable to any explanation that Clinton
might be able to make in his defense. Instead, the Republican
prosecutors could not even sit still while the president's lawyers
rebutted their charges.
</P>
<P>
   Every evening they issued their immediate broadsides and took to
the airwaves to quarrel with every contradiction of their
arguments. They could not bring themselves for the president's
defense to have its uncontroverted day even as the president's camp
had been silent when they made their case.
</P>
<P>
   It was just this ambitious, sweaty-palmed behavior that appeared
to turn events against them at week's end. Hardly ever was such a
result so justly earned.

VALENTINE GREETINGS ETCHED IN CHOCOLATE

<P>
   It's not too early to start thinking about Valentine's Day,
especially if the gifts need to be ordered and shipped.
</P>
<P>
   In a catalog aimed at the chocolate-cards-and-flowers holiday
coming up on Feb. 14 and published by Hershey's, the chocolate
people, we find a personalized solid chocolate greeting card. The
9-by-9-inch card, made of two pounds of Hershey's milk chocolate,
comes with any custom message of up to 24 letters and spaces,
written in chocolate or red candy.
</P>
<P>
   The sentiments are contained within a large heart held aloft by
a pair of cherubs and beneath a rosebud. Order the card, priced at
$16.95 with chocolate greeting or $17.95 for candy, by calling
800-454-7737.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For your love, so long as he or she has a sense of humor,
consider some of the Valentine's gifts available from Wonderfully
Wacky, a catalog and a site on the World Wide Web that offers,
naturally, wacky items. All of the Valentine's Day ideas cost less
than $25; among the most reasonable and interesting is the $5.95
rose with a computer chip that allows it to play the Elvis Presley
tune ``Love Me Tender.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the non-Valentine's products are the Udderly Cool Kow
Pottee, the $6.99 bucket/bowl that resembles the titular bovine
gland, and the Fondle Me Bubba Doll. When squeezed, the $24.95 Bill
Clinton doll says things such as, ``I'll bomb Baghdad, I'll bomb
France, if you'll remove my underpants.''
</P>
<P>
   Visit the Web site at http://www.wonderfullywacky.com or call
800- 788-1957 to order or request a catalog.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   For a more attitudinous celebrant of Valentine's Day, the
Make-Up Art Cosmetics (or MAC) company will soon be releasing a
handful of new colors under the general category of ``The Five Sins
of Lipglass.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two of the conventional seven deadly sins have a lip-color
corollary, Lust and Greed; the other three _ Spite, Desire and
Deceit _ are MAC-designated. (The other sins are gluttony, sloth,
pride, envy and wrath.) The lip products will ``create a
patent-leather shine for lips.''
</P>
<P>
   Apply Deceit, for example, for a ``decadently deceptive
chocolate glaze.'' Choose Desire to create a ``passionate port,
shining with desire,'' which we assume is a description of the
color and also a vulgar pun. MAC Lipglass, with a suggested retail
price of $11.50, is set to appear in stores by the beginning of
February.

ANIMAL RIGHTS GROUP SENDS VEGETARIAN MESSAGE TO POPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DENNIS YUSKO  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last Lent, the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals
(PETA) sent their campaign theme, ``Jesus was a Vegetarian,'' by
mail to 449 Catholic bishops, archbishops and cardinals in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the secular group from Norfolk, Va., will take its
message straight to the Pope.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II will be greeted Tuesday in St. Louis on his
motorcade route with two 25-by-12-foot billboards, sponsored by
PETA, proclaiming, ``Jesus was a vegetarian.''
</P>
<P>
   This Lent message is being organized once again by Bruce
Friedrich, campaign coordinator of PETA, who is also responsible
for a billboard directly outside of Oral Roberts University in
Tulsa, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christians should stop eating meat because Jesus was the
Prince of Peace,'' Friedrich said. ``Do we want to visit misery,
suffering and bloody death every time we sit at the dinner table?
Our choice should be self-evident,'' said Friedrich, a vegetarian
of Catholic faith.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Bishop Howard Hubbard of the Albany diocese received
a copy of Friedrich's letter, asking him to ``encourage your
diocese to follow Jesus by adopting a vegetarian diet throughout
Lent and beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was inspired by Catholic bishops, when in November
of 1997, they floated the idea of reaffirming the longtime Catholic
tradition of meatless Fridays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have read your comments with care,'' Hubbard replied, and
``I appreciate your kindness in sharing your views on
vegetarianism.''
</P>
<P>
   So was Jesus a vegetarian? Friedrich believes Jesus was a
fish-eating vegetarian, and quotes Genesis 1:28 to support his
opinion: ``I have given you every plant yielding seed which is upon
the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit;
you shall have them for food.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposite camp's view is summed up by the Rev. Jay Francis,
president of the Capital District Ministries Fellowship in Albany,
N.Y., a group of full gospel and Pentecostal ministries.
``Scripture never imposes vegetarianism, or even suggests that it
is a spiritually superior way of life,'' said Francis, who is also
pastor of the Rock Road Chapel in Berne.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the vegetarian movement is based on New Age Hinduism
or Eastern thought, which has its roots in reincarnation,'' Francis
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Francis camp says that Paul's teachings, especially in I
Timothy, specifically warn against judging others for what they
eat.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the matter of what, when and how to eat is considered very
serious by many religions.
</P>
<P>
   Islam forbids the eating of pork, and the eating of anything in
daylight hours during Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   Seventh-day Adventists specifically promote vegetarianism.
According to Internet sites dedicated to the faith, about 50
percent to 60 percent of its members are vegetarians. The sites
claim members benefit from lower rates of cancer, heart and
circulatory diseases, and longer lives.
</P>
<P>
   The Mormon Church has traditionally prohibited drinking alcohol
or smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The Albany Stake President John vom Lehn of The Mormon Church
(The Church of Jesus Christ Latter-day Saints) said the church's
teachings include that ``meat should be used sparingly, in times of
cold or famine,'' said vom Lehn, who eats some meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the church also says it's not appropriate to direct others
not to eat it, so it's mixed,'' vom Lehn admitted.
</P>
<P>
   But Friedrich thinks the issue is a simple one. ``This is about
bringing compassion and mercy into our daily lives,'' Friedrich
said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Schwartz, author of ``Judaism and Vegetarianism,''
agreed. ``Vegetarianism fulfills the six mandates of Judiasm- take
care of your health, treat animals with compassion, save resources,
enrich the environment, pursue peace and help the hungry,''
Schwartz explained.

and you were right there, riding alongside the Boston silversmith
in all his one-if-by-land, two-if-by-sea glory. Mrs. Conrad's
telling of events made everyday life seem boring and staid.
</P>
<P>
   Sigh.
</P>
<P>
   If only we knew when seminal events took place, then we wouldn't
merely have to study them. We could be eyewitnesses to history.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment trial of President Clinton in the U.S. Senate
has offered us that chance. A historic undertaking, as the news
anchors endlessly tell us, scheduled for live broadcast every day.
Switch on the television and, voila, instant history.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the more we see, the truer the old cliche sounds: Be careful
what you wish for _ you might get it.
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts the gravity of the situation. But the day-to-day
workings of the trial have been filled with lawyerly speechifying
of such partisan legal detail that anytime actual emotion is shown,
the grateful media pounce on the moment and replay it again and
again. For better or, more likely, worse, the trial bores many of
us. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Lurid bait for teens
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So how do you teach it? How do you impart the historic import?
Could even Mrs. Conrad have made something of it? Sure, says
someone who knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gold mine for a government teacher,'' said Greg Good,
who teaches four advanced-placement social-studies classes at
Mountain View High School in Mesa. ``It brings the Constitution
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Not, he noted, what is actually taking place before the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't watch it much,'' he said. ``It's not high drama. You
can get kind of burdened in the minutiae. But we certainly follow
the politics of it on a daily basis. That tends to be the more
interesting part of it anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, sex is always a good way to grab a teenager's interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's sort of a natural hook to get the kids started talking
about the process because of the sordid nature,'' Good said. ``It
definitely makes it easier to teach the basics of the Constitution.
It is kind of sad, but you're talking about an MTV kind of
generation that needs to be stimulated.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the MTV generation that has that need. Look at the
way we cover news stories. Mrs. Conrad's long tales are history, in
more ways than one. We are suckers for sound bites, for quick,
bright stories. The droning way in which this trial has progressed
has made our appetite for them only worse. If there were some way
to boil the whole thing down to a half-hour sitcom, we'd have more
interest. Depending on who starred in it. &QL; 
Historic boredom
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Or we could listen to people such as Good. When he talks about
the trial, his words come quickly, and his enthusiasm is evident.
Yes, the everyday elements may be mind-numbingly partisan and dull.
But they're still history.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's boring, it's boring because it's basically a foregone
conclusion what's going to happen,'' he said. ``We forget about the
significance of this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Good hasn't. Never mind Monica for a moment, for instance.
Instead, he suggested, think about the significance of Cheryl Mills
_ a Black woman _ speaking before the Senate in the president's
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much have times changed since the last time we experienced
this process?'' Good asked, referring to Andrew Johnson's trial
before the Senate in 1868.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is even more unusual than declaring war. If it's another
131 years till we do this again, it won't happen to your children,
to your grandchildren, your great-grandchildren, probably even your
great-great-grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   When he puts it like that, as Good does in his classes, he's
done his job, the same way Mrs. Conrad did hers. He doesn't
necessarily make you want to watch all of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   But he does make you want to remember it. &QL;

BULL'S-EYES FROM BUMPERS 
</HEADLINE>

 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; -- Trivia freaks will recall that it started with a
necktie. Serious students should never forget that near the end of
the country's second impeachment trial of a president _ a
proceeding even more embarrassing and shameful than the first one _
the necktie was supplanted as metaphor by a marble statuette of a
bear's head.
</P>
<P>
   We shook our heads at the necktie. But in the Senate last week,
heads nodded at Dale Bumpers's tale of the bear's head, because by
then what had once been odd had become familiar; what was a weird
stretch in August had become by January par for the course.
</P>
<P>
   First, the necktie. It was a gift from Monica Lewinsky to
President Clinton. Five months ago, as she was beginning her grand
jury testimony, she noticed that Clinton was wearing it during a
Rose Garden appearance. She said she wondered if he was sending her
a signal. Lewinsky's fixation is human, but what caused heads to
shake was the fact that Ken Starr and his prosecutors took her
seriously and put this absurdity on the record once they had the
president under oath.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Dale Bumpers spoke, however, the context had
changed. With the examples now legion of zeal gone mad, evidence
buried, connections manufactured out of thin air, and inferences
piled on top of conjecture, nothing could surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's choice of Bumpers, a former senator for only three
weeks after representing Arkansas for four terms, was inspired. The
press reports of a long friendship didn't fool Bumpers's former
colleagues. They knew that he and the president had mostly been
sharp-elbowed rivals in Arkansas, that this was a beloved club
member taking a stand for his favorite cause, the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   And Bumpers's one foray into the impeachment's case's
``evidence'' was similarly inspired. It wasn't technical, or even
richly prohibitive, merely all-revealing.
</P>
<P>
   The marble bear's head was of Native American origin, and we
know from Starr's hyper-diligence that the president brought it
back from Vancouver just before Thanksgiving, 1997. And then, in a
bag of other trinkets from the Black Dog on Martha's Vineyard, we
also know he gave it to Lewinsky on one of the case's most
important dates, Dec. 28.
</P>
<P>
   As White House deputy counsel Cheryl Mills had established in
her brilliant presentation the day before, the only evidence is
that it was Lewinsky who was worried about gifts and an invasion of
her apartment by Paula Jones's lawyers. At least for those
referring to actual evidence, Clinton didn't give a hoot about
them. But in Starr's world, gifts are not gifts, but signals.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, in the grand jury, Lewinsky was asked if he told
her anything about what they were now calling the Vancouver Bear.
She said: ``I think he, I believe he said, that the bear is the
maybe Indian symbol for strength, you know, and to be strong like a
bear.''
</P>
<P>
   And now the big moment.
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``And did you interpret that to be strong in your decision to
continue to conceal the relationship?''
</P>
<P>
   A: ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   One is tempted to quote Clinton attorney David Kendall's acidic
question about Lewinsky's more famous ``No one ever asked me to lie
and I was never promised a job for my silence. Is there something
difficult to understand here?'' But the House Judiciary Committee
refused to take no for an answer. In its impeachment report to the
full House, the fact that Clinton gave gifts on the same occasion
he allegedly obstructed justice by trying to hide other gifts
``seems odd,'' but the committee said the answer can be found in
Lewinsky's testimony. ``The only logical inference,'' the committee
asserted, ``is that the gifts, including the bear symbolizing
strength, were a tacit reminder to Lewinsky that they would deny
the relationship even in the face of a federal subpoena.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee then repeated this falsehood in its official trial
brief to the Senate. It may be the House's problem if its Judiciary
Committee slings bull at the full membership, but you have to be a
taco short of a combination plate to sling documentable bull at the
final arbiters.
</P>
<P>
   Rubbing it in a bit thickly, Bumpers went on: ``Is it perjury to
say that the only logical inference is something when the only
shred of testimony in the record is `no, that was not my
interpretation?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, of course, that's not perjury,'' Bumpers said after
establishing its moral equivalent, but he added in the vernacular
of one pol addressing a hundred others: ``I'll tell you what it is,
it's wanting to win too badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Bulls-eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``There a total lack of proportionality, a total lack of balance
in this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bulls-eye.
</P>
<P>
   The White House legal presentation included more than dozen
examples of this that were far more probitive _ from cellphone
calls at the wrong time, to falsified times of the day for court
orders, to contrary inferences drawn in spite of explicit evidence
to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   But Bumpers's sense of the Senate led him to another buried tale
that was as much metaphor as outrage. The fact that the Vancouver
Bear saga was more vignette than evidence only added to its impact.
</P>
<P>
   Any senator who has ever fudged a fact, made one up, gone
overboard, miscast an aspersion, or slung bull (now we're talking
the whole chamber) could grasp Bumpers's point.
</P>
<P>
   Know your audience, they teach; it's the essential step in
convincing it.

IN COURT, YOUTHS LOSING THEIR INNOCENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the 100th anniversary of the juvenile courts,
the line separating children from adults in the criminal-justice
system has eroded. And calls to overhaul _ or even abolish _
juvenile courts have grown louder and more insistent.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the state with the second-oldest juvenile
court after one in Illinois, and a state with a national reputation
for its approach to rehabilitating young offenders, the ground has
begun shifting toward a stringent model that makes it easier to put
minors into adult courts and prisons at a younger age.
</P>
<P>
   In the past six years alone, 40 states have passed laws making
it easier to prosecute children in adult criminal courts. Many have
also passed laws excluding minors from juvenile courts and
increasing the power of prosecutors, while diminishing the
discretion of juvenile court judges.
</P>
<P>
   The change reflects public fear about violent crimes committed
by youths, as well as concern that particularly brutal crimes were
not being properly punished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen years ago . . . kids were seen as modern-day
Huckleberry Finns, rather than kids who had hurt others,'' said
Larry Feeney, general counsel to the Massachusetts Department of
Youth Services. ``Now we recognize we have to both protect the
public as well as rehabilitate the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Youth advocates say the public does not realize that the vast
majority of juvenile crimes are not violent, and that young
offenders who are treated as adults become a bigger threat to
society because they are deprived of the efforts to rehabilitate,
which are rarer in the adult system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court was established as an attempt to say kids are not
just small adults, but people of tender years with a future ahead
of them,'' said Judge Martha Grace, chief justice of the
Massachusetts Juvenile Court. ``I am disturbed by the tendency now
to lock kids up and throw away the key.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Chicago established the first juvenile court in the nation
in 1899, children 14 and older were considered to be as responsible
as adults for their actions. Minors as young as 13 were
occasionally sentenced to death, and some were executed.
</P>
<P>
   Discomfort with the death penalty and with imprisoning children
with adults led to the creation of a separate court acting as the
parent or guardian of young offenders. Remedies include therapy,
education, and community service, as well as incarceration and
restitution to victims.
</P>
<P>
   The court was founded on these principles: All children are
different _ more impulsive and more irresponsible, but also more
impressionable _ than adults; they should be confined apart from
adults; and penalities should be individually tailored to ensure
not just punishment but rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   The remaking of the juvenile system began in the early 1990s,
when a wave of youth violence, accompanied by media images of young
``superpredator'' killers, fueled a movement to impose stiffer
penalties, longer sentences, and adult prison terms on juvenile
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to revamp the system are being heard in state legislatures
as well as in Congress, where a bill to make it easier to punish
and confine children in adult courts and prisons will be
reintroduced this year, according to staff members of the Senate
and House Judiciary committees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned that we may not be paying as close attention to
maintaining a system of personalized justice, rehabilitation, and
due process for kids,'' said Shay Bilchik, administrator of the
Justice Department's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquent
Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   While criminal justice specialists agree that violent offenders
should be held responsible, and that the public protected, they say
the push to punish rather than rehabilitate has been driven by fear
rather than fact. The arrest rate for violent juvenile crime has
fallen for four years in a row _ 23 percent since 1994, according
to a Justice Department report released this month. The arrest rate
for murders by juveniles has dropped 40 percent in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Putting juveniles into adult systems is often a political
response to sensational murder cases, specialists argue. In
Somerville, Mass., for instance, the trial of 15-year-old Edward
O'Brien Jr. for the murder of his neighbor preceded passage of the
Massachusetts law.
</P>
<P>
   The law automatically shifted all minors 14 years and older
charged with murder out of juvenile court and into the adult
criminal system. It also gave judges the power to sentence any
juvenile to state prison as well, rather than time at the
Department of Youth Services.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992 in Massachusetts, the juvenile crime rate has
declined, yet the number of minors committed to the Division of
Youth Services has doubled. Minors are also receiving sentences
twice as long as they were before the state passed the Youthful
Offender Law in 1996, DYS said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Massachusetts' system works very well, but the rallying cry to
lock more kids up goes out every time there is a horrible crime,''
said Jerome Miller, who as Division of Youth Services commissioner
in the early 1970s reorganized the Massachusetts juvenile
correctional facilities. ``There is not one study to support the
notion that harsher terms deter crime.''
</P>
<P>
   A study funded by the MacArthur Foundation and released in
December by Frank Zimring, a law professor at the University of
California at Berkeley, also found that juvenile crime rates had
not increased over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legislative activity around the nation has been motivated by
the sense of a national youth violence emergency,'' he said. But,
Zimring added, those changes were driven by flawed analysis of
statistics, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Youth advocates also argue that pushing children into adult
courts and prisons ignores a main reason for the separate court
that was established 100 years ago: Minors cannot protect
themselves against adult criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children should not be anywhere near adult prisons, where they
are brutalized and come out in worse shape than they would in
juvenile confinement,'' said Wallace Mlyniec, a law professor at
Georgetown University and the chairman of the American Bar
Association's juvenile task force.
</P>
<P>
   In response, some prosecutors and politicians, like
Massachusetts Representative Paul Haley, Democrat of Weymouth, say
that only a small number of youths end up in state prison. The
threat of an adult sentence, Haley said, has given sentencing some
teeth and the juvenile system some credibility on the street, Haley
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The district attorneys are pleased they have another tool to
correct the unacceptable behavior of some who believed nothing of
significance could happen to them as long as they were under 18,''
Haley said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kenneth King, deputy director of the Suffolk University Law
School's Juvenile Justice Center, said the 1996 law has ``corrupted
the trial process'' by pressuring juveniles to plead guilty in
order to avoid the threat of being sent to Walpole.
</P>
<P>
   The new Massachusetts law, however, is mild compared with others
in the nation. In Kentucky, 14-year-olds charged with any felony
can be tried as adults if they are found with firearms. In Kansas,
the burden of proof shifts to the child to prove he or she belongs
in juvenile, rather than adult, court.
</P>
<P>
   Some states have excluded all 16- and 17-year-olds from juvenile
courts, imposed mandatory sentences, proposed the death penalty,
and increased the number of minors charged and incarcerated in the
criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Some specialists have argued that a surge of juveniles in the
system has created a system that provides warehousing and ``social
control,'' rather than the rehabilitiation envisioned 100 years ago
by the court. Some even believe kids would be better off if the
system was dismantled altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``The juvenile court should go on the ash heap of history,''
said Barry Feld, a juvenile justice professor at the University of
Minnesota School of Law. ``It is a scaled-down second-class court
that provides young offenders with neither therapy nor justice.''
</P>
<P>
   But most juvenile justice experts have voiced agreement with
Schinder: The system is troubled, but not broken. Stripping minors
of the protection and rehabilitation promised by the juvenile
court, they say, would set back the clock 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tremendous gains that benefit both children and society have
been made in juvenile justice in the last century,'' said Bernadine
Hall, national chairwoman of the Coalition on Juvenile Justice in
Washington. ``We must resist quick fixes.''

IN CASE ANYBODY'S LISTENING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Hello, E.T.? This is Earth calling. We'd like to tell you a
thing or two.''
</P>
<P>
   Only once before has the human race attempted to broadcast a
signal to the stars, and that effort was just a three-minute
transmission a quarter-century ago. But now, a group of astronomers
has come up with an audacious proposal to beam a 400-kilobyte
message, consisting of 22 pages of information (one of which is
reproduced above), to four nearby stars. They hope to make the
three-hour broadcast later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Communicating with someone who speaks a different language is
hard enough. But how do you even begin to compose a message for
alien beings about whom we know absolutely nothing _ including
whether they even exist?
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have been mulling over that question for at least 100
years, and have come up with several ingenious ideas. Basically,
they all boil down to one premise: Mathematics is likely to be the
universal language.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the earliest idea emerged in the 1800s: Dig ditches in
the Sahara desert in the shape of a huge 3-4-5 right triangle with
squares on its sides _ an example of the Pythagorean theorem. The
ditches would be filled with kerosene and set ablaze at night, in
hopes of convincing Martian astronomers that intelligent life
existed on Earth. The plan was never implemented.
</P>
<P>
   A more modest effort was attempted in 1974 by Frank Drake, the
pioneer of the Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence (SETI), who
in 1957 conducted the first search for alien radio signals. Drake's
message to the stars, beamed from the Arecibo radio telescope in
Puerto Rico _ the world's largest _ contained just 1,679 bits
(binary digits, or zeroes and ones) of information.
</P>
<P>
   Drake's message consisted of a rectangular grid that an aliens
could reconstruct to provide a crude diagram of the solar system
and of a DNA double-helix molecule, along with a smattering of
other information. The length of the rectangle's sides consisted of
prime numbers of picture elements, or pixels, and the total number
of bits sent was divisible only by these two primes. The idea was
that alien mathematicians would figure out the two prime factors,
allowing them to arrange the data so as to to reconstruct the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A more ambitious plan
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The current proposal is a more ambitious version of the same
basic concept: a series of pages that can be reconstructed by
arranging the series of zeroes and ones from the broadcast into
squares of the right size. To help in the reconstruction, each page
is surrounded by a frame one pixel wide.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was developed by physicists Yvan Dutil and M. Stephane
Dumas of the Defense Research Establishment Valcartier, near Quebec
City, Canada. Their concept was outlined this month at a meeting of
the American Astronomical Society.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their 22-page message, whose first draft they
have sent to be reviewed and refined by several colleagues, the
scientists hope to follow it with a series of greetings from people
around the world _ for a fee. They say they welcome suggestions and
critiques, recognizing that to send a message on behalf of the
whole planet is an inherently presumptuous act.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Tartar, director of the SETI Institute, calls the plan to
send the message ``a crazy commercial stunt.'' But she calls the
group's efforts to devise a message that is as easy to decode as
possible ``a really interesting excercise,'' and she has invited
them to describe their work at a conference she is organizing.
</P>
<P>
   The group has already solved its most daunting challenge:
Finding a suitably large radiotelescope to broadcast the message.
They have an agreement to use a 230-foot-wide dish in the Ukraine,
powered by a 150-kiloWatt transmitter. With this combination, they
calculate, their message should be clear enough to be decoded by
any civilization within 100 light years of Earth. That's 600
trillion miles.
</P>
<P>
   They also figure that while it would not be clear enough to
decode, the signal could at least be picked up and identified as
the product of an intelligent civilization by any star within
100,000 light years _ provided that civilization has a
radiotelescope at least one square kilometer in size. Earthlings
don't have one that size, but expect to in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   The drafted message includes several pages about mathematics and
basic physics, a few about biology and geography, a diagram and
some basic data about our solar system _ and a request that the
recipients send back some information about the world they call
home.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carl Sagan's plan
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It also includes a somewhat crude copy of a drawing that was
affixed as a plaque to the Pioneer 11 spacecraft at the request of
astronomer and author Carl Sagan. The drawing is a simple
representation of a nude man and woman, their hands open in
greeting. The plaque, and CDs containing images and sounds of Earth
that were attached to the two Voyager spacecraft, are the only
other messages ever deliberately sent into space. But the
likelihood that these plaques will ever be found by aliens is
remote.
</P>
<P>
   So if Dutil's and Dumas's radio message is indeed sent out, and
if it is picked up, what are the odds of its being correctly
deciphered by beings we cannot even imagine? Remote, at best.
</P>
<P>
   An illustration of how much difficulty Earthlings can have
translating one another's languages, even with all the needed
information right at hand, look no further than the document the
French-speaking physicists sent out to explain their project.
</P>
<P>
   It begins: ``This document will present and explained the
message in a simplify way.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   By the time President Clinton's defense team got done exposing
the weakness of the House Republicans' articles of impeachment last
week, there was not enough left of the GOP's case to argue, much
less continue.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the GOP's right-wing leaders pushed on, knowing their
arguments to convict Clinton of perjury and obstruction of justice
were virtually destroyed by the defense team's calm, persistent,
and effective rebuttals.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republican managers insist on calling witnesses to
testify before the Senate, in hopes they can salvage, if not
revive, their wish to heap further embarrassment on the president,
and somehow persuade enough Democrats to vote for his removal to
make up a majority.
</P>
<P>
   But the more realistic Republicans know that even witnesses are
not likely to significantly change the math. There are simply not
12 Democrats who will give the 55 Republicans the two-thirds
support required for Clinton's removal.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after the Clinton defense team's withering assault that
turned what the GOP assumed was a solid case for removal into a
pile of partisan sand, the chances of a vote for dismissal _ which
requires a simple majority of 51 votes _ have become at least a
less remote possibility. Acquittal, eventually, remains all but a
certainty.
</P>
<P>
   The president and his team gained ground by going on offense.
His lawyers methodically dissected the House GOP's charges, and
Clinton then did what he does best: He gave a rousing State of the
Union address that elated Democrats and dismayed his critics.
Moreover, Clinton's performance reminded voters why he should
continue to lead the nation for the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Charles F. C. Ruff was the first on Clinton's team to challenge
the GOP's version of events head-on, and raise serious questions
about claims that Clinton obstructed justice by, for example,
attempting to get a job for Monica S. Lewinsky in order to obtain
her silence. Ruff gave details of what the three key players _
Lewinsky, Clinton friend Vernon E. Jordan Jr., and presidential
secretary Betty Currie _ said under oath. Their testimony clearly
contradicted the GOP's charges.
</P>
<P>
   After Ruff's performance, legal analysts and scholars agreed
that he was ``persuasive'' and ``effective'' in his cool, reasoned
attack. Similar praise went to special counsel Gregory Craig, who
made the case for perjury appear as solid as Jell-O. And then came
White House deputy counsel Cheryl D. Mills, who effectively
rebutted charges that Clinton obstructed justice by ordering Currie
to retrieve gifts from Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   As only the third African-American in history to speak from the
Senate floor _ she followed former Senators Edward W. Brooke of
Massachusetts and Carol Moselely-Braun of Illinois _ Mills
effectively countered the charge that Clinton committed civil
rights violations in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said, ``I'm not worried about civil rights because this
president's record on civil rights, on women's rights, on all of
our rights, is unimpeachable.'' Her defense of Clinton and of
Currie was summed up when she said it was an insult to Currie to
suggest her loyalty to Clinton ``breeds dishonesty.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's personal lawyer, David Kendall, continued the
offensive, citing direct testimony in which both Lewinsky and the
president said under oath that he never asked her to lie in a legal
affidavit. As Lewinsky testified, ``No one ever asked me to lie and
I was never promised a job for my silence.'' Kendall also pointed
out instances in which the managers selectively ignored evidence
and testimony that would have exonerated Clinton. As Kendall said,
``Is there something difficult to understand here?''
</P>
<P>
   What apparently was not so difficult for Clinton's team to
explain, and for the Senate to understand, is that the Republicans'
case consisted of a lot more sizzle than steak.
</P>
<P>
   To wrap up the case, Clinton friend and former Arkansas senator
Dale Bumpers admonished the Senate like a well-respected preacher
admonishes his parishioners to do the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   Bumpers noted that Clinton was not harming the nation by
concealing the affair. He was simply trying to protect his family
from his own disgraceful actions.
</P>
<P>
   Bumpers made perhaps his strongest point when he quoted the
line, ``When somebody says its not about money, it's about money.''
The comment evoked laughter from the Senate floor. But when he
said, ``When someone says its not about sex, it's about sex,''
there was stunned silence from Clinton critics, who have claimed
their case against Clinton is about perjury and obstruction of
justice _ not sex. Bumpers made his point.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt he also persuaded a few Republicans to consider the
seriousness of their actions if they vote for conviction. He argued
that removing Clinton would set a dangerous precedent from which
the nation might never recover, and that it would create more havoc
than Clinton ever could.
</P>
<P>
   When the questions from both sides of the Senate aisle finally
end, so should this trial. The only reason the GOP right wing wants
witnesses is as a last-ditch hope that some unexpected revelation,
some bombshell, would allow them to pull victory from the jaws of
defeat. But since the House managers already presented everything
they could find, such a bombshell is not likely.
</P>
<P>
   What is likely, however, is that if the GOP persists in
lengthening this trial to serve its own political purposes, it will
discover a different bombshell: the one an angry electorate drops
directly on the Republican Party in the next election.

COMBATING THE FEAR OF BEING POOR WHEN OLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Each weekend I read your column aloud to my girlfriend to
help her share my fear of growing old poor. It's working. Here's my
story: I am 37 years old and make $57,000 a year working for a
nonprofit corporation. I don't contribute to Social Security, and
the company offers a pension arrangement called the Money Purchase
Plan instead, into which it contributes an amount representing 20
percent of my salary. This is invested in stock mutual funds. In
addition, the company allows me to contribute up to 5 percent of my
salary to a 403(b) plan, again invested in stock mutual funds.
Finally, it has added a new savings option, a 457 plan. Under this,
if our contributions to the 403(b) plan do not exceed $8,000, we
can contribute the difference to the 457 plan. Since I live in fear
of growing old poor, I make the maximum allowed contributions to
the plans. With a current balance of $70,000 in all these plans, am
I on track to a comfortable retirement? What are 403(b) and 457
plans? How much money do I need to set as a reasonable goal, and
when would I reach it?
</P>
<P>
   S.F., San Diego &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. So you find my column the perfect vehicle to feed your
appetite for masochism, eh?
</P>
<P>
   Well, I'm afraid I'll have to puncture your balloon: You're in
fine shape, and you'll have to find a better way to dissipate your
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Between the $8,000 a year you are now contributing to the 403(b)
and 457 plans and the $11,400 your employer puts into that Money
Purchase Plan, you should be able to amass something in the
neighborhood of $3.8 million by the time you're 65. That estimate
presumes average annual investment returns of 10 percent over the
next 28 years.
</P>
<P>
   Now, let's consider what you will need in retirement. If
inflation averages 3.5 percent for the next 28 years, you will need
an income stream of $149,346 to give you the same buying power that
your current salary represents. But you'll need only $2.5 million
in a fixed-income portfolio to produce a $150,000 income stream _ a
calculation that presumes a 6.5 percent yield from the fixed-income
investments and no invasion of principal.
</P>
<P>
   That would give you $1.4 million that you could leave in
growth-oriented investments such as stocks, designed to protect you
against inflation in the later years of your retirement. This is
called sitting pretty.
</P>
<P>
   If you keep going along the path you've established, the biggest
problem you'd be likely to face in retirement is taxes. Both 403(b)
and 457 plans are very similar to 401(k) plans, but both have been
established for educational, tax-exempt, or government workers.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, they let you put aside money on a pretax basis now,
but Uncle will levy taxes on withdrawals during retirement, and he
will insist on mandatory withdrawals after age 70 1/2. For most
people this works well: In retirement they anticipate having a
lower income stream and therefore will pay taxes at a lower rate.
But you will likely have the opposite problem _ rocketing into a
very high tax bracket in retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, I suggest that you divert $2,000 of your annual
savings from the 457 plan and put that amount (the maximum allowed)
into a Roth IRA. This will cost you a bit of money, since
contributions to Roths are made with after-tax dollars. But in
exchange for paying the taxes upfront, there will be no tax when
the money is withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Let's consider the effect of this, just looking at your
first-year contribution. If you put $2,000 into a Roth this year
and if you're in the 28 percent tax bracket, it will hike your tax
bill by $560. But if you achieve 10 percent average annual returns
for the next 28 years, that $2,000 would have grown to $29,308 _
and it could be withdrawn with no tax liability at any time you
like after age 59 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   If you were to pursue a strategy of fully funding a Roth account
for each of those 28 years, the pool would amount to $314,944 _ a
tidy sum to have on hand to help you in organizing your tax
situation to your best advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Most of my initial calculations are based on retiring at age 65.
So how much earlier might you retire with a solid sense of
financial security? Well, let's consider that you're now living on
$49,000 _ your salary less the $8,000 you're saving for retirement.
To maintain that buying power in 20 years, again presuming 3.5
percent inflation, you would need $97,500, and to produce that
income stream you would need about $1.5 million in a fixed-income
account.
</P>
<P>
   Going back to the savings projection, in 20 years your pool
would be $1,633,199 _ which would leave you with $133,199 to be
invested in your inflation-hedge fund. For most people, that would
probably be enough _ after all, you aren't going to live forever,
so there's no reason not to invade your principal in the later
years of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   These projections are all based on contributions at current
levels. Since your current savings patterns are all based on
percentages of your salary, every time you get a raise, the
accumulation schedule will jump ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, it may turn out that you could comfortably retire well
before either age 57 or 59.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm in the third grade. Our school doesn't teach us much
about money. I want to be a millionaire by the time I'm 40. Right
now I have $2,619 that has been saved since I was born _ $2,005 in
a stock holding account, $258 in a Roth IRA, and $356 in the bank.
I got this by saving from my $4 weekly allowance, $250 a year I
earn doing odd jobs, $200 a year from presents, about $25 a year as
rewards for good grades, and $25 that my parents add for every $500
I save. As I get older, I will get a steady job. But for now, how
can I reach my goal? Should I invest in a stock mutual fund such as
Stein Roe Young Investors?
</P>
<P>
   T.S., Coronado, Calif. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, recently Alan Greenspan was complaining that the nation
isn't saving enough, but you can't prove it by this sack of mail.
</P>
<P>
   How do you get from here to there? It wouldn't make much sense
for me to suggest that you start saving $462 a month, would it?
(Although that's the level you might need if you were to save in
360 equal installments.)
</P>
<P>
   So let's look at where you would get if you simply keep up what
you're now doing _ saving $649 a year. I'll guess you're now about
10 years old, so we'll assume that your savings period would be 30
years and that you earned average 10 percent returns. By age 40,
that savings pace would take you to $157,370. That isn't $1
million, but it ain't hay either.
</P>
<P>
   So rather than work out a savings plan, let's just propose that
you save as much as you reasonably can _ my bet is that if you
maintain the savings discipline you've built so far, once you begin
earning some serious money, the numbers will take care of
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that Stein Roe Young Investor is a good
fund, building an admirable above-average record in less than five
years of operation. You'd have to wait until you had $500 in your
IRA to meet its minimum initial deposit requirement, but at the
rate you're going that should pose little problem.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The short story you mentioned in your Jan. 11 column is
Somerset Maugham's ``The Lotus Eater.'' One of the strengths of
your column is recognizing human nature and the variability of
human preferences. Others so often sound like someone preaching
what he's sure is the true religion in every detail. Regards from a
(grocery) coupon clipper.
</P>
<P>
   A.N., Rye Beach, N.H. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Thank you _ both for the nice compliment and for steering me
back to the story whose author and title I had long forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Rereading it, I find I had a few details muddled, but the thesis
(or the part of it I fastened upon) was intact _ that you can't
project a 30-year-old's mindset into the brain of a late
middle-ager, and when you contemplate a long-distant retirement you
would do well to adopt the views of someone who's already there.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks also to Michael Short of the Associated Press bureau in
Boston, who was the first to jog my furtive memory on the Maugham
story, but who had a head start because he knew how to reach me
quickly.

HE'S OFF TO BE THE `WIZARD' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mickey Rooney's show business career of 77 years isn't the only
thing on his mind. The diminutive performer, who made his stage
debut at the age of 18 months at Chicago's Haymarket Theater, is
thinking of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think of this millennium problem?,'' he asked in a
phone interview from a hotel room somewhere on the road where he's
currently featured as the Wizard in ``The Wizard of Oz,'' the
musical opening Friday in Boston. . ``The elevators will stop. The
lights are going out. The subways will stop. The signs will go off
in Las
</P>
<P>
   Vegas. What are we going to do? The computers are going to shut
down. I don't have a computer. It might be dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the Wizard could fix it,'' I said, hoping to turn the
conversation to the current musical stage incarnation of the L.
Frank Baum stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm serious,'' he said. ``This is a serious problem. But I'm
not that worried because God won't let anything bad happen, and
neither will Bill Gates.''
</P>
<P>
   Rooney, a Christian Scientist, is excited about visiting the
Mother Church during the musical's Boston engagement. ``I think
Mary Baker Eddy was a great woman and her work has certainly
inspired me. But we're here to talk about this wonderful stage
show. I'm not the star. The star is Jessica Grove who makes me
think of my great friend Judy Garland. She died.''
</P>
<P>
   Rooney paused. While he wasn't in the original 1939 film, ``The
Wizard of Oz,'' starring Garland, MGM sent him on the road to
promote it because he was one of the studio's biggest stars and it
was Garland's first big picture. Rooney, according to his
autobiography, ``Life Is Short,'' was paid $900 per week, and the
pair appeared in Washington, Hartford, New Haven, and New York. In
1974, he was the voice of the Scarecrow in the animated film,
``Journey Back to Oz.''
</P>
<P>
   Rooney's numbers are impressive. The 78-year-old star has made
more than 300 films, including more than 50 Mickey McGuire movies
before he was 18, starred in dozens of stage shows, hundreds of
television shows, married eight times and divorced seven. His first
marriage to Ava Gardner lasted 17 months and his fifth, to Marge
Lane, ran just 100 days. But, his latest, to singer Jan Chamberlin
has been going since 1978. He was nominated for an Oscar as best
supporting actor for his performance as a gambling GI in ``The Bold
and the Brave'' (1956) and for his performance as a horse trainer
in ``The Black Stallion'' (1979), and received an Academy Award for
lifetime achievement in 1983. In 1980, he made his Broadway debut
in ``Sugar Babies.'' He made millions, and spent millions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was ready for my golden years after my 18th
birthday,'' he said, with that trademark laugh.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '60s, Rooney was pulling in nearly $20,000 per week
in Las Vegas in the Folies Bergere and losing twice that much
shooting craps. He abused drugs. He was unfaithful to whomever he
was married to at the time. He'd gone from being the No. 1
box-office star to a supporting player at $25,000 per picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he said. ``All that stuff's in my book. It's a lot
different now.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's the big difference between making films during the
so-called Golden Age of Hollywood at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in the
'30s and '40s and making movies now?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything,'' said Rooney. ``John Travolta and Clint Eastwood
are walking studios unto themselves. They make the deals. In the
old days, we were employees. It was like a family. And they don't
make movie musicals anymore. Too expensive, they say. I thought it
would be great to bring this show, `The Wizard of Oz,' to Las Vegas
and play the MGM Grand Hotel. But I guess it's too expensive or
something. I don't know. But I'll tell you one thing. This Jennifer
Grove who plays Dorothy is sensational. And we have the Scarecrow
and the Tin Man. It's a terrific show. As good as anything on
Broadway. We're like a family. And it's a good family show.''
</P>
<P>
   Family is important to Rooney. In many ways, Louis B. Mayer was
like a father to Mickey. Rooney's own father, Joe Yule, deserted
the family when Mickey was still a kid. Living with Mom was no
treat either. She was a showgirl with a lot of boyfriends.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all in the book, too,'' he said. ``What I wrote was the
truth, the sometimes painful truth. But that's all behind me now.
I'm doing great.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickey was beginning to sound a lot like Andy Hardy, the cheery
All-American who could overcome any obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am an optimist,'' he said. ``Why not? What's better?''
</P>
<P>
   Rooney paused again. ``I enjoy doing what I do every day I do
it. What's the alternative? I don't believe in complaining. Sure,
there are some things that bug me. Sure there are. Like everything
else. But I've got a lovely wife and a lovely home. I'm playing the
Wizard. Sure, I wish there were more parts for older actors. What's
wrong with writing a picture for Gregory Peck or Mickey Rooney? I'm
better now than when I was making all the money. But, hey, I've got
my health and my wife and my kids and my God. What else do you
need? Never mind. I'll answer that. Nothing. Nothing at all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Inspire, don't retire''
</P>
<P>
   Rooney, who recently was named to the California Commission on
Aging, said, ``Age is experience and some of us are more
experienced than others. Inspire, don't retire.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's neither retired, nor retiring. He's shooting a Garden
State Life Insurance commercial on his ``off'' day and he's working
on a nationally syndicated talk show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep going is my advice,'' said Rooney. ``Just keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of advice, what advice does the man who finally has a
successful marriage after seven tries have for married couples?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had one piece of advice to give husbands, it'd be this,''
said Rooney. ``Keep your mouth shut. If I'd have done that sooner
I'd be a lot better off now.
</P>
<P>
   I coughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You OK?'' he asked. ``You should take a Cold-Eeze.''
</P>
<P>
   Do they work?
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, they work,'' he said. ``They're sponsoring my radio
show.''
</P>
<P>
   Rooney laughed. Just a bit more wizardry from a star who's mined
everything from the Golden Age of Hollywood to his golden years in
the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I still love every minute of it,'' he concluded.

ROMANTIC GETAWAYS FOR VALENTINE'S DAY

Lake Tahoe instead of Nevada's ....)

<TEXT>
<P>
   A walk on a Caribbean beach at sunrise. Champagne and a bubble
bath for two at a quaint bed-and-breakfast. A sleigh ride under
starry mountain skies. A whispered discussion about impressionists
at a great museum.
</P>
<P>
   What's your idea of romance?
</P>
<P>
   No matter their definition, Americans love romantic getaways.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the latest numbers available, 61.8 million Americans
slipped off for at least one romantic holiday. According to the
Travel Industry Association of America, one-fourth of the adults
polled took two or more sentimental journeys during the year.
</P>
<P>
   By far the most popular romantic getaway was the city visit,
enjoyed by 74 percent of those polled. That was followed
not-so-closely by the beach or lake-front romp (44 percent),
gambling and gushing excursions (21 percent), golf and tennis (12
percent don't know love means nothing) and cruising (12 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Only 7 percent of the romantic travelers preferred the slopes.
That may surprise the pollsters of California's Ski Lake Tahoe,
which last year proclaimed that romance is on the runs after 56
percent of their clients said they were more intimate on the
mountain than at home.
</P>
<P>
   We bring up all this lovey-dovey stuff because _ check your
calendar _ Valentine's Day is approaching. And Feb. 14, with its
hearts and expectations, falls during a long holiday weekend
courtesy of Presidents Washington and Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Someone you love deserves (or may expect) a surprise. And a
romantic getaway may be just the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   But where to go, what to do?
</P>
<P>
   Don't procrastinate. You may be too late to find a place at a
popular ski resort or Caribbean island. The week of Presidents Day
is typically one of the most popular travel weeks of the year. If
you do find space, expect to pay premium rates.
</P>
<P>
   One destination with plenty of space is Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The City of Brotherly Love has declared that ``Love is More Than
A Game'' in a promotion that hopes to fill the 5,000 hotel rooms
that were reserved for NBA All-Star weekend. Eighteen hotels had
rooms blocked off for the Feb. 14 event, which was canceled before
the players and owners reached a contract agreement earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimated that the city lost $35 million when the game
was eliminated. Rebounding, some hotels, as well as attractions,
are offering specials good on Valentine's weekend. Call
800-537-7676 for information.
</P>
<P>
   You also can avoid the holiday crowds by opting for a
destination where Presidents Day isn't celebrated.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Europe, says Martha Morano, president of Les
Romantiques, a newsletter that spotlights romantic destinations
around the world. (You can get a free copy by calling
800-223-9832.)
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are opting to go to European cities because
the air fare is so good,'' Morano says. These travelers are waiving
a warm destination or more traditional Valentine's getaway for
three days in Paris or four in London, she explains.
</P>

HOLLYWOOD'S SMARTER SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Movies dumbing down? Don't you believe it. To say that movies
belong to ``The Waterboy,'' ``There's Something About Mary,'' and
``Armageddon'' is like saying that soup is about carrots. Sure,
there are carrots in the pot. But soup is also about the onions,
potatoes, celery, and maybe a nice piece of chicken simmering
alongside the carrots. The old year ended and the new year has
begun with a wave of movies that unflinchingly focuses on serious
subject matter, and in complex ways. Three are drawn from so-called
real life: ``A Civil Action,'' ``The Thin Red Line,'' and ``Hilary
and Jackie.'' ``Affliction,'' the fourth and darkest of the lot,
comes from a novel by Russell Banks. Not a speck of dream-factory
fluff in the lot.
</P>
<P>
   Most remarkable, perhaps, is that two _ ``A Civil Action'' and
``The Thin Red Line'' _ come from big Hollywood studios, the former
from Disney, the latter from 20th Century-Fox. ``A Civil Action''
is a dark, sad, heavy film, without the neat resolutions Hollywood
usually appends to its legal thrillers. It could hardly have been
otherwise, given its promise to be an essentially factual account
of the landmark Woburn toxic pollution case. It isn't a star trip
for John Travolta as attorney Jan Schlichtmann, who represented
eight Woburn families claiming that toxic wastes seeped into their
well water and gave their children leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   Travolta and Robert Duvall earn their star billing. Travolta
proves he can be a character actor as well as a pop icon. Duvall is
an actor's actor as his wily adversary, keeping everything subtle,
incisive, economical, even when he plays Mephistopheles. In a bold
inversion of the image of God giving Adam the touch of life on the
ceiling of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel, Duvall slides a $20 bill
across a bench to Travolta, telling him to imagine six zeroes after
it if he'll call it a lawsuit then and there.
</P>
<P>
   The real case wasn't a thing of courtroom histrionics. Neither
is the film. If anything, it replicates the frustrations
encountered by the plaintiffs in trying to get their story told in
court, and not being allowed to. What gives ``A Civil Action'' its
weight and resonance and human connection, however, isn't its
marquee players. It's the actors playing the parents, especially
Kathleen Quinlan's Anne Anderson, James Gandolfini's Al Love, and
David Thornton's Richard Aufiero. They don't say much. They don't
have to. All, in their own ways, suggest repositories of grief and
anger and pain, looking for redress, strong enough to stand up to
the fact that life _ as reflected in this film _ almost never
supplies storybook endings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thin Red Line'' pretty quickly answers the question of
whether Terrence Malick can still direct a film after an absence of
25 years. He can. Remarkably, it's very much of a piece with his
last film, 1978's ``Days of Heaven,'' in its view of an Edenic
paradise spoiled by humans, from which Malick maintains a
detachment that makes his film risk seem enervated and even effete.
Because it's about a historically important World War II battle, it
was inevitably compared to Steven Spielberg's ``Saving Private
Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   But the films are as intrinsically different as their respective
theaters of war _ Europe and Asia. Spielberg's D-Day film has a
much stronger narrative line and more overall cohesiveness than
Malick's film of James Jones's novel about the Battle of
Guadalcanal. (Ironically, it was during a Guadalcanal naval battle
that five Sullivan brothers were killed. The premise of ``Ryan''
arises from their deaths.)
</P>
<P>
   The big risk Malick takes is challenging audiences to assemble
the film from the nearly three hours of footage he provides. Some
of it is lovely, but frankly sophomoric. Glimpses of Malick's
romanticized Pacific island would better have served his theme of
despoilment than what becomes his excessive focus on the island's
flora and fauna. The real Battle of Guadalcanal lasted six months.
It must have been more gritty and grueling than it seems here.
While Malick's decision to intersperse the combat scenes with
reveries of individual soldiers imparts a welcome interiority to
what usually is a genre of externals, the effect is to atomize the
film even further. ``The Thin Red Line'' is a noble effort, but it
isn't the film ``Saving Private Ryan'' is.``Saving Private Ryan''
is an instant classic that deserves every award it gets.
</P>
<P>
   The film that comes closest to a traditional Hollywood model is
``Hilary and Jackie,'' the biofilm about the late cellist
Jacqueline du Pre and her sister Hilary. Unfortunately, it
perpetuates one of Hollywood's worst habits, depicting genius as
unstable and therefore somehow suspect, especially if the genius is
a woman. That being said, the film avoids the genius crack-up
cliches when Jackie's behavior becomes erratic and finally
hysterical before she's diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, the
degenerative nerve disease that prematurely ended her career and
shortened her life.
</P>
<P>
   The memoir on which the film is based, by her siblings _ sister
Hilary, brother Piers _ has been controversial. Some have accused
Hilary of mean-spirited payback in her depiction of Jackie as
willful, demanding, selfish, and disruptive. It climaxes with
Jackie bolting from a concert tour, showing up at Hilary's house,
and demanding that Hilary share her husband with Jackie. Although
she was not only one of the stars of the '60s, but one of British
culture's breaths of fresh air, Jackie is depicted as driven by
competitiveness and tortured by ambivalence toward her career.
What's less present are the buoyant spirit and intense physicality
with which she played.
</P>
<P>
   What makes an interesting but sometimes questionable film so
riveting are the performances of Emily Watson as Jackie and Rachel
Griffiths as the quieter but no less storm-tossed Hilary, who chose
marriage and country life after Jackie's cello-playing eclipsed
Hilary's musicianship on the flute. Griffiths has the more
difficult assignment because so much of what goes on with Hilary is
internalized. But Watson is astonishing in a real high-wire act,
sans net. She's even more jolting than she was in ``Breaking the
Waves'' when it comes to believably conveying raw emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Women seldom get the chance to play tempestuous sexuality to the
extent that she plays it. One wishes it had been less equated with
hysteria. Obviously, Watson has studied du Pre's videos. I attended
several of du Pre's concerts, and marveled at Watson's ability to
capture du Pre's body language, directness, and confident attack. I
wish there had been more screen time devoted to her music-making.
As it is, one scene is exhilarating. At a recording session, du Pre
and her husband, pianist Daniel Barenboim, start improvising their
own riffs on Beethoven. What I'll never forget is the expression of
alert ecstasy on Watson's face as she matches her husband, stride
for stride, telling him with her flashing eyes that she'll go
anywhere he goes _ and does.
</P>
<P>
   While ``A Civil Action,'' ``The Thin Red Line,'' and ``Hilary
and Jackie'' are governed by the particulars of the real-life
stories they tell, ``Affliction'' comes entirely from fiction. Yet
as the best fiction does, ``Affliction'' makes contact with deep
truths not available to real-life-based films. In this case, Banks,
and now filmmaker Paul Schrader, bares the sociopathology of male
bonding. Nick Nolte deserves at least an Oscar nomination for his
performance as a tortured cop, stuggling to take control of his
soul, or at least keep from reverting to the patterns of violence
transmitted by his brutish alcoholic father.
</P>
<P>
   The latter, played by James Coburn in the performance of a
lifetime as if the father had just stumbled out of a cave, has
literally allowed his wife (and the mother of Nolte's cop) to
freeze to death after a lifetime of metaphorically freezing her
heart. The question is whether Nolte's cop named Wade, who seems to
lose ground with each demeaning year in his New Hampshire town, can
pull his life together or will backslide once he's drawn into the
gravitational field of his father's joyless rural house. The
subject of male violence is meat and drink to Schrader, who has
studied it since ``Taxi Driver'' and ``Mishima,'' and here takes
full advantage of the world specified by Banks.
</P>
<P>
   When Sissy Spacek, as the sweet woman with whom Wade is trying
to launch his first successful relationship, walks into the old
house you think of as a lair, your hackles rise. One woman died
loveless here. Will she be the second? You want to tell her to run.
That's how primal and dread-filled Wade's world is. It's frozen,
wintry, bleak, short on light. ``Affliction'' exists in a world of
ancient archetypes. It's a grim fairytale, laser-beam accurate in
its skewering of the mechanisms that keep men enslaved by
self-destructive patterns masquerading as manly virtues. So. War,
toxic waste, sibling rivalry, domestic violence. No mindless
escapism here.

<P>
   BAGHDAD _ They are Iraq's lost generation _ stunted by
malnourishment, trapped in ignorance, orphaned by war, and
forgotten by the world.
</P>
<P>
   In an open market in downtown Baghdad, an army of these Iraqi
street kids peddle cigarettes, shine shoes, and lift wallets under
an enormous, hand-painted mural of a smiling Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   These children are living evidence of what the United Nations'
imposed economic sanctions have wrought in Iraq _ and a disturbing
vision of the future. Even if the embargo were lifted tomorrow,
hundreds of thousands of children would be left with irreparable
developmental damage caused by eight years of crippling sanctions.
But sanctions alone can't be blamed. The suffering is compounded by
a nation dragged into two costly wars, a dictatorship that builds
palaces while children starve, and a bureaucracy that lets urgently
needed medicine sit in warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   But now there is new momentum to ease the UN embargo in the
aftermath of the US-led airstrikes against Iraq last month. UN
Security Council members France, China, and Russia stepped up
efforts last week to ease sanctions. The United States insists that
sanctions are the only way to contain Iraq's program to develop
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the diplomatic parrying over sanctions, the children of
Iraq continue to suffer from them.
</P>
<P>
   On Baghdad's streets, many children are stunted by years of
malnutrition. Children who say they are 15 and 16 look more like 9-
or 10-year-olds. They are glaringly uneducated and ignorant of the
modern world. Of 30 children interviewed through an interpreter,
not one of them knew what a computer was. Simple questions were
greeted with blank stares and downward glances.
</P>
<P>
   A tall boy with vacant eyes sat in front of the huge mural of
Saddam Hussein's disturbing grin. The boy was filthy and flies
buzzed around him. About six younger boys, sitting on rusted paint
cans and waiting to shine shoes of passersby, explained that he
just doesn't talk to anyone anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to talk and he used to go to school,'' said Saad.
``But now he won't say anything. He just sits there and gets food
out of the trash.''
</P>
<P>
   The market is offically named The Market for the Friends of the
Ministry of Interior. But everyone calls it ``Ali Baba's,''
referring to the gangs of young thieves and pickpockets who flock
there to fence stolen goods. Rows of tables are laid out with
watches, radios, wallets, and used clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Qais Jabar, 16, and his brother, Rassol, 15, dropped out of
school and live by peddling junk they pick up on the street. Their
father was among the hundreds of thousands of Iraqi soldiers who
died in the Iran-Iraq war, and they do what they can to help their
mother feed the family.
</P>
<P>
   Qais carried a broken window he found at a building damaged in
US missile attacks, an item he thought might bring 10 cents at the
market. His brother was trying to sell a pair of cracked, plastic
sandals and a hair brush.
</P>
<P>
   When asked repeatedly what he wanted for his future, Qais kept
replying, ``I just want to live my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Three older men wearing sports jackets suddenly appeared at
Qais's shoulder and appeared to be government officials. One of the
older men said, ``Tell him you want an end to sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' the boy nodded, looking down. ``This is what we want.
Do you want to buy a window?''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, children waded through the traffic of Liberation Square,
begging for money. One boy without shoes pleaded and cried with his
hand held out on a cold, gray winter day.
</P>
<P>
   The squalor of this corner of the city, and the hunger and lack
of education here, are not so different from many Third World slums
throughout Asia and Africa. Many veteran international aid workers
say Baghdad has less suffering among its young street people than
New Delhi, Mexico City, and even Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   But for Iraq the poverty and the hopelessness of its youth are
stark reminders of how far the country has fallen. In the early
1980s, Iraq was a confident and wealthy nation, the second-largest
producer of oil in the world. It had some of the developing world's
best hospitals and universities. It boasted high literacy rates and
low percentages of child deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Now, veteran UN workers compare Iraq to the world's basket cases
in terms of illiteracy and infant mortality.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a proud country, and now we have lost a whole
generation. They are wasted, and without them we have to ask,
``What is our future?'' asked Ali Jassim, 34, who taught English in
a middle school for 10 years until he could no longer live on a
salary of $10 a month and took to driving a taxi.
</P>
<P>
   After Hussein's military miscalculations _ the bloody and
grueling 10-year war with neighboring Iran and his invasion of
Kuwait _ Iraq is exhausted and defeated. The punishing UN economic
sanctions imposed as a condition of the cease-fire in the 1991
Persian Gulf War further crippled the country. Since 1995, Iraq has
been allowed to import oil for food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Nahal, director of the Middle East Council of Churches
aid program in Iraq, walked through the open market on a recent
cold evening looking for the children who sleep in doorways to
offer them shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most are orphans of war, all are malnourished and their growth
stunted as a result,'' said Nahal. ``The problem is these
developmental problems can't be reversed. This generation will be
written off.''
</P>
<P>
   This month, the UN aid program UNICEF reported that 1 million
Iraqi primary and secondary school pupils did not enroll in school,
or 20 percent of the total. About 200,000 more dropped out during
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Illiteracy rates are increasing at 5 percent a year. About 25
percent of children under age 5 are malnourished. In 1991, before
the sanctions, only 9 percent were.
</P>
<P>
   These statistics make Iraq one of the world's few countries that
are steadily declining in health and education, according to
UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
   ``The education system has collapsed,'' said Gloria Fernandez,
who leads UNICEF's education projects. There are no books, schools
are falling apart, and teachers are quitting over unbearably low
pay, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Suham Hamza, who is a junior high school teacher just outside
Baghdad, said, ``The kids who haven't dropped out come to school
hungry, tired, and in rags. They can't concentrate. They just slip
further and further behind.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the children who survive the sanctions. Many do not.
Activist groups fighting sanctions, such as the US-based Voices in
the Wilderness, cite a New England Journal of Medicine study of
Iraq from 1992, which concluded that nearly 6,000 additional child
deaths occur per month as a result of the sanctions. The figure was
based largely on data provided by Iraq and the study was conducted
at the height of the postwar impact of sanctions. Nevertheless,
Voices in the Wilderness and others extrapolate that monthly
mortality rate out over eight years to conclude as many as 500,000
children have died from sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The former UN coordinator for humanitarian aid in Iraq, Dennis
Halliday, has supported this staggering figure. Halliday quit the
UN after watching the suffering due to sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the process of destroying an entire society. It is
illegal and immoral,'' Halliday said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   But senior UN officials counter that the projections of hundreds
of thousands of deaths are a reckless distortion. They say that it
has been virtually impossible to obtain an accurate picture of
child deaths caused by the sanctions. John Mills, a spokesman for
the UN's oil-for-food program, said there is ``intense suffering.''
But he added that exaggerations of death tolls do not help the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, UN officials have focused on what they see as
widespread and inexplicable delays of distribution of aid by Iraqi
officials. Mills said that $287 million worth of medicines provided
through the oil-for-food program _ nearly half of the medicines
delivered over the past two years _ remain in warehouses. Another
$8 million earmarked for ``therapeutic milk'' for malnourished
infants and protein biscuits for nursing mothers have not been
delivered, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are allocations just to stop the malnutrition,'' Mills
said. ``Unfortunately, they do not even begin to address the more
costly and difficult efforts needed to turn around the effects of
malnutrition.''
</P>
<P>
   On the streets of the Ali Baba market the effects are on display
every day. The ``generation of the sanctions'' who gather in this
market have a song that they consider an anthem. It's by Iraqi pop
star Khadem Sahair and is titled ``Remember.'' It was blaring on a
radio that 18-year-old Ethar Abbas, who dropped out of school in
fourth grade, was trying to peddle.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly translated, the lyrics are:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When you go to sleep at night, remember.
</P>
<P>
   My people eat stone
</P>
<P>
   To stop the hunger.
</P>
<P>
   Can you sleep at night?

FREED SLAVE'S STORY IS FOCUS OF NEW INTEREST 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Vermont)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. _ When the drugs that had been slipped into
his drink wore off, virtuoso fiddler Solomon Northup of Saratoga
Springs awoke in Washington, D.C., just blocks from where the
Smithsonian Institute now stands.
</P>
<P>
   More than 150 years later, Northup's simple description of that
day hasn't lost its sting: ``I found myself alone, in utter
darkness and in chains.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of how Northup, a free black man, was lured to the
nation's capital, kidnapped and sold into slavery stands as a
reminder that even in upstate New York, blacks were at risk.
``Twelve Years a Slave,'' Northup's memoir, owes its existence to
his unlikely rescue from the bowels of slavery in Louisiana's Red
River Valley.
</P>
<P>
   With two exhibits at the Nott Memorial in Schenectady, Union
College is putting the spotlight on this little-known story for
Black History Month.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibits display student and faculty research into every
particular of the memoir _ from his bill of sale into slavery to
the New York Times story of his rescue _ and feature the
Northup-inspired art of renowned sculptor Terry Adkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its not just a piece of local history, it has all manner of
national importance,'' said Professor Clifford Brown, head of the
Nott Exhibitions Committee. ``The story is unique because here is a
Northern man with a Northern education thrust into slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit has already attracted the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who
plans to visit next month. More important to scholars, it has put
Union at the center of ongoing research showing the kidnapping of
free blacks to be far more widespread than originally believed.
</P>
<P>
   After the shipment of blacks from Africa officially ended in the
early 1800s, abduction became a lucrative business with agents and
runners in the North. The Maryland gang of Patty Johnson, for
example, bragged of kidnapping more than 100 slaves, including 12
from Philadelphia in a single bout.
</P>
<P>
   Men lured women of mixed race with promises of marriage. They
got children with treats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most significant thing about Northup's story is that he
lived to tell the tale,'' said Carol Wilson, associate professor of
history at Washington College in Chestertown, Md., and author of
the 1994 book ``Freedom at Risk: The Kidnapping of Free Blacks in
America 1780-1865.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so far away from home in such an isolated place, it's
almost inconceivable that he won his freedom,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While blacks in New York City were warned of the dangers by
posters and newspapers, such reports seldom hit the hinterlands of
upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   In 1841, Solomon Northup, 33, lived in Saratoga Springs with his
wife and three children. He played the violin and had a reputation
for being ``wherever young people assembled to dance.'' It was
after one such event that he was approached by two men of
``respectable appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   They claimed to be from a Washington circus company and offered
him a quick gig in the off-season. He accepted.
</P>
<P>
   They treated Northup in style, putting him up at Gadsby's
National Hotel, which a year later would play host to Charles
Dickens.
</P>
<P>
   But it was all an elaborate ruse. The hotel was owned by a
prominent slave-owner. The day after his fateful trip to a local
tavern, Northup found himself in a pen with the sadistic slave
dealer James Birch. The irony was not lost on Northup that the
events transpired within ``the very shadow of the Capitol.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Blow after blow was inflicted on my naked body,'' Northup
wrote. ``When his unrelenting arm grew tired, he stopped and asked
if I still insisted I was a free man. I did insist upon it, and
then the blows were renewed, faster and more energetically than
before.''
</P>
<P>
   With searing pain and empathy even for his masters, Northup
described his journey to various plantations throughout the South.
He ingratiated himself into the slave community and learned to
survive playing the role Southern society expected of him. When the
Victorian diction of his acid ``Yes sir, master,'' infuriated a
plantation owner, he forced himself to say ``Yassuh, massah.''
</P>
<P>
   In one unforgettable encounter, Northup was almost hanged when
he pulled a whip from his master's hand and turned it on him. He
was saved from the death sentence because a local overseer noted a
peculiarity of Southern law: Northup's former master had a mortgage
on him for $400.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the eye of someone not born a slave, you get an
incredible, detailed story of bondage,'' said Margaret Washington,
professor of history at Cornell University. ``He went from the
partnernalistic upper South to the harsh lower South of Louisiana
to the Red River Valley, where no one wanted to go. The average
lifespan there was 8 to 12 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The turning point came more than 11 years later. A sympathetic
white man wrote a letter on Northup's behalf, posted Marksville,
La., which reached his wife in Saratoga Springs. That set the
wheels in motion that would eventually lead to his rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Northup's wife went to Henry B. Northup, the local district
attorney. He was also the nephew of the slaveowner who gave Solomon
Northup's father his freedom _ and his name.
</P>
<P>
   Under a law signed by Gov. William Seward, New York could
appoint an investigator to look into the kidnapping of free blacks
_ a role Henry Northup eagerly accepted.
</P>
<P>
   To prove that Solomon was a free man, the lawyer solicited
affidavits from prominent leaders of both parties, in addition to
letters of introduction from the secretary of war, a Louisiana
senator and a justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   But how to find Northup, lost in the inaccessible reaches of the
deep South? He enlisted the aid of a lawyer in Marksville, John
Waddill. Henry Northup suspected that Solomon Northup got the
letter out with the help of an abolitionist and he asked the lawyer
if he had seen any.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never, but one,'' Waddill replied.
</P>
<P>
   His hunch was correct. The lone abolitionist of Louisiana's Red
River Valley was indeed the letter writer and pointed him to the
bayou plantation where Solomon had been living under the name
Platt. With a midnight order from a local judge, Northup reunited
with his namesake and was promptly freed.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he achieved liberty, but not justice.
</P>
<P>
   A lawsuit he brought against the slave dealer Birch was
dismissed because Northup was black, and hence, could not testify
in a Washington court. A later suit brought in New York against his
kidnappers made it all the way to the state Court of Appeals, but
was apparently lost in a thicket of legal technicalities.
</P>
<P>
   One of the story's many ironies is that Northup was treated more
humanely by the justice system of Louisiana than by the courts of
Washington and New York.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the story fades into mystery. Northup's last
reported sighting was an 1855 book engagement in Montpelier, Vt.
Five years later, the census lists his wife as head of household.
Sometime in the intervening years, he died, but no records exist.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe that Northup, in his fifties, his body broken by
his years in bondage, died natural causes. Others suspect foul
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is speculation that he was murdered for the ruckus he
made,'' Washington, of Cornell University, said. ``After all, he
named names and exposed the undercurrents of slavery. He was a
dangerous man.''

PARTISAN OVERTONES AMID BIPARTISANSHIP TALK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Committee shake-ups in the state Senate and huge
trial lawyer contributions to Democrats may not have any obvious
connection to each other, but they do share partisan overtones in
this alleged era of bipartisanship.
</P>
<P>
   Both events made headlines last week in the afterglow of Gov.
George W. Bush's and Lt. Gov. Rick Perry's inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, in his first significant act in his new office, may have
pulled a surprise or two with his committee assignments. But surely
no one was surprised that he appointed more Republican (nine) than
Democratic (six) chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Partisan tides may rise and fall, but there is one fact of
political life that remains undisputed _ to the victor belong the
spoils.
</P>
<P>
   For the second legislative session in a row, Republicans hold a
majority of Senate seats. The Senate rules still give the
lieutenant governor the power to appoint Senate committees. And
there was no way in the world that the first Republican lieutenant
governor in Texas history was going to do anything but fill a
majority of Senate leadership positions with Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   This type of political math doesn't require a computer.
</P>
<P>
   No one, after all, was exactly shocked last session when
then-Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, a Democrat who prided himself on his
bipartisan approach to lawmaking, appointed more Democratic chairs,
even though the Senate had a Republican majority then.
</P>
<P>
   Perry vows that the Senate's work will still be conducted in a
bipartisan manner, and it probably will be _ mostly, anyway _ for
several reasons:
</P>
<P>
   _ As has been observed before, most legislative issues are
nonpartisan.
</P>
<P>
   _ A longstanding rule will still require a two-thirds vote to
approve any bill in the Senate. With only a 16-15 Republican
majority, neither party can gang up on the other.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bush, the maybe would-be president, is insisting on harmony.
</P>
<P>
   _ Democrats will still hold important Senate posts, although
Perry has scrambled the lineup, partly for partisan reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest loser in the committee shuffling was Sen. John
Whitmire, a Democrat from Houston, who lost the chair of the
Criminal Justice Committee, a position that he had held for three
sessions under Bullock.
</P>
<P>
   It was no coincidence that Whitmire also was a strong backer of
Perry's Democratic opponent, John Sharp, in last fall's lieutenant
governor's race.
</P>
<P>
   The new Criminal Justice chairman will be another Democrat, Sen.
Ken Armbrister of Victoria. Armbrister's new assignment is arguably
a demotion from his previous post as chairman of the prestigious
State Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The State Affairs plum went to Republican Sen. Florence Shapiro
of Plano, who has never had a committee chair before but headed the
Senate's Republican Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Perry also made a number of changes in the overall committee
structure. The sizes of some committees were reduced, he said, so
that senators would have fewer conflicts among committee meetings.
</P>
<P>
   He also split the old Health and Human Services Committee into
two smaller panels _ one on health services and the other on human
services.
</P>
<P>
   The official reason for creating two committees was to divide a
heavy workload. But in the world of politics, it is fair to
speculate that Perry also wanted to save a chair for Sen. Judith
Zaffirini of Laredo, who headed the old panel and will chair the
new Human Services Committee, and create a leadership opportunity
for Sen. Jane Nelson of Flower Mound, who will head the Health
Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson is a Republican. And Zaffirini, although a Democrat,
hosted a ``late-train'' fund-raiser for Perry after the Nov. 3
election.
</P>
<P>
   Perry retained several key Republican committee chairmen who
initially were appointed by Bullock. They include Bill Ratliff of
Mount Pleasant, Finance; Teel Bivins of Amarillo, Education; David
Sibley of Waco, Economic Development; and J.E. ``Buster'' Brown of
Lake Jackson, Natural Resources.
</P>
<P>
   Although the motivations of Senate committee appointments can be
subject to interpretation, there was nothing subtle about other
news last week that the five law firms that represented Texas in
the anti-tobacco suit gave $1.8 million to the Texas Democratic
Party last year and thousands of additional dollars to individual
Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Many people have always suspected that one of the reasons Bush
and other Republicans have opposed the high legal fees awarded in
the tobacco case was because they feared much of the money would
eventually end up in Democratic hands _ and maybe even be used in a
presidential race against Bush.
</P>
<P>
   That looks like a reasonable assumption.
</P>

WELFARE REFORM: THROUGH A CHILD'S EYES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SALLY JACOBS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Mass. _ Alicia DesLaurier is the kind of welfare
expert America needs.
</P>
<P>
   She has extensive experience in the field, having been on
welfare almost all of her eight years. She will proffer her opinion
without being paid large sums of money or being made first author
on a research paper. A nonpartisan to her core, she wisely prefers
her pussycats to presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   So what is Alicia's analysis of the overhaul of the nation's
welfare system, the controversial initiative that has nudged her
mother off welfare and into a full-time job as a nurse's aide?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is much better now,'' declared Alicia, adjusting the pink
ribbon securing her pigtail. ``My mother is home when I get home
from school and she buys lots more food. I think I don't like
welfare at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Alicia's opinion matters in part simply because she is a little
girl who is poor. But it also matters because children _ who
represent two-thirds of the nation's welfare caseload _ are bearing
the brunt of the massive shift of the nation's poor from welfare to
work. And, as with welfare reform overall, it is difficult to tell
exactly whether Alicia is better off or not _ despite her firm
opinion that she most definitely is.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, Alicia's mother, Janice Mezzetti, has a job.
After 16 years more on welfare than not, Mezzetti got a job at the
East Longmeadow Skilled Nursing Center last June after completing a
state-funded training program. A former crack user with a sporadic
drinking history, and the daughter of a welfare recipient, Mezzetti
was gradually phased off public assistance, receiving her last
welfare check in October. For Mezzetti, 36, a single mother of two,
the two-year clock on benefits has struck its final chime.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mezzetti works 37 hours a week and sometimes more, she
is financially worse off than when she was on welfare, like many
others who are now supporting themselves.
</P>
<P>
   On welfare, Mezzetti pocketed a monthly $250 in food stamps, a
cash benefit of about $525, and a rent subsidy, all of which
amounted to roughly $14,000 a year. Now she earns about $7 an hour,
or an annual $13,670, which puts her a little above the federal
poverty line. Mezzetti will continue to receive Medicaid,
state-funded health care, for one year; she will be eligible for
benefits at her job in April.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What this all means for Alicia is a small white room in the
fourth-floor walkup her family moved into last year after they were
evicted from their old apartment. Mezzetti and her 16-year-old
daughter, Amanda, share one room. Alicia has a room of her own,
cluttered with stuffed animals, a platoon of Barbies, and towel
beds for four kittens and a ferret named Bo-Bo. Even suffused with
the aroma of animal droppings and her mother's cigarette smoke, it
is a cherished haven for a child who has been through a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Alicia, whom the Globe first visited in June 1997, when her
mother was taking the first steps toward independence, is almost 9
now. In 1995 she was placed in foster care for nearly a year while
her mother fed her addiction to crack. Earlier, when Alicia fell
down the stairs and broke her teeth at age 2, her father filed the
jagged edges to the quick and a dentist later had to remove the
roots. Because she has had no front teeth since then, Alicia has
had difficulty talking and, as a result, reading and writing. She
is a grade behind in school and has a hard time eating an apple.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning, shortly after her mother has gone to work, Alicia
flips her hip-length braids over the arms of her tiny pink armchair
and watches three TV cartoon shows while her sister gets ready for
school. When ``The Magic Schoolbus'' ends, Alicia heads out the
door and walks by herself to the corner store, where the school bus
picks her up.
</P>
<P>
   As Alicia sees it, the best thing about getting off welfare is
that her mother, who works from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m., can meet her when
the bus drops her off in the afternoon. Because their building is
flanked by two busy streets, Alicia rarely plays outside, and she
and her mother spend many afternoons watching cartoons and playing
games. When they were on welfare, Mezzetti worked part-time at
Burger King in the afternoons and sometimes Alicia stayed at a
neighbor's apartment until well into the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to bed, I used to miss her so much,'' Alicia said
of her mother. ``Now she's there almost all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Another benefit of going off welfare, in Alicia's view, is that
there is more food in the house. When the family received monthly
food stamps, Mezzetti bought groceries once each month. By
mid-month, supplies were often running out. Now that she gets a
weekly paycheck, Mezzetti shops every week, and while there may not
actually be more food coming into the house, it comes more often.
To celebrate that weekly check, Mezzetti sometimes takes her girls
to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now she even buys those little strawberry bears,'' exclaimed
Alicia. ``And those are my favorite.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Mezzetti has to work a lot harder for her money now,
she agrees with Alicia that things are better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to wait for the check to come in the mail every
month,'' she said, collapsing on her floral couch at the end of a
recent workday. ``I work when they're in school. And I have money
during the week instead of just once a month.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment. How long it will last is anybody's guess.
Mezzetti has gone off welfare twice before, only to go back on
again when her addictions reasserted their grip. In 1997, the
Department of Social Services received a complaint that Mezzetti
was drinking again, and DSS officials reopened her case; it was
closed again just two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   What's different this time around?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't drink or screw up,'' declared the husky-voiced
Mezzetti. ``That's why I was on welfare so long. You got no
inspiration. You know. No aspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mezzetti is just the kind of person that child advocates worry
about in the midst of welfare reform. It is true that statistics
show promising developments: In 1997, about 71 percent of poor
children lived in families where someone worked, up from 61 percent
in 1993. Also, the number of children living below the federal
poverty level dropped slightly to 19.9 percent in 1997 from 20.5
percent in 1996, according to US Census figures.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates argue that even with a booming economy, many
families are poorer when they go off welfare than when they were on
it. And should they lose their jobs, most have few places to turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that even in a good economy, many families are even
poorer off welfare than on has us very worried,'' said Deborah
Weinstein, director of family income for the Children's Defense
Fund. ``We have no evidence that the way reform is being
implemented will protect children at all.''
</P>
<P>
   At the red-brick William N. DeBerry School, which Alicia
attends, the state's December deadline marking the two-year cutoff
of welfare benefits has already sent a dark ripple among the 350
students, virtually all of whom are poor. In the past few weeks,
teachers have noticed nearly a dozen students who do not have
winter coats and appear unkempt and poorly nourished. Some come to
school late and still have not had breakfast. Some who have no warm
clothes simply stay home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids can't learn if they're hungry,'' said Mattie Jenkins, the
school's parent involvement specialist. ``They can't learn if
they're not nurtured. And a lot are being left at home alone while
their parents work. It's not safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Alicia knows nothing of this. What she knows is that at the
DeBerry school she has begun to shine. Specialists say that the
frequent moving and changing of schools is often associated with
the poor result in bad behavior and declining academic performance.
Alicia's older sister, Amanda, for example, ran away from home for
two weeks last spring. She has already repeated the ninth grade
twice, but rather than have her try a third time, Mezzetti placed
her in an alternative high school program last fall.
</P>
<P>
   For Alicia, however, a new school has provided a new lease on
life. When she began at DeBerry in September, Alicia spoke little
and kept to herself. Administrators placed her in a small reading
group for children with delays, moved her to a new homeroom, and
started her on speech therapy. Now the second-grader has pulled
herself up a grade level in reading, leaps to read aloud from ``The
Naughty Anne,'' and chatters her way down the green corridor
showing off her Christmas cloud mittens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it much better here because people listen to me,'' she
explained. ``Even the teacher is my friend.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is one more thing. It has nothing to do with welfare or
statistics. It is a thing so small that few but Alicia know about
it, and yet it promises to end a most miserable chapter of her
childhood. It is right there, the shadow of a left front tooth,
about to drop from her soft pink gum.

AMA'S FIRING OF EDITOR DRAWS BARBS WORLDWIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The outcry over the American Medical Association's recent
dismissal of its top editor has gone global, with leading medical
journals from Australia to Sweden condemning the move and calling
on the AMA to reverse it.
</P>
<P>
   Even a Russian has weighed in, wondering whether the United
States has surrendered its cherished freedom of the press.
</P>
<P>
   The AMA move ``is a demonstrative example of bare-faced and open
censorship,'' wrote Dr. Saveli Bashinski, editor of Russia's
International Journal of Medical Practice. The AMA's explanation
that it had fired Dr. George D. Lundberg because he had improperly
embroiled the association in impeachment politics, Bashinski added,
reminded him of ``our recent totalitarian past.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Smith, editor of the British Medical Journal, said
in a telephone interview from London Sunday that his Web page has
been inundated with letters like that since he ran an editorial
last week blasting the AMA. ``I've been impressed with just how
outraged and how international the reaction is,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``George should be reinstated, not only for his benefit but for
the Journal of the American Medical Association's benefit and for
the AMA's benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   But the AMA president, Dr. Nancy Dickey, said that of the
doctors she has talked to, ``at least as many are supportive of the
decision as oppose the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the association might reconsider the dismissal,
Dickey said: ``One thing they teach you in medical school is never
to say never. But I have no anticipation the decision will be
reconsidered or reversed.''
</P>
<P>
   The furor began a week and a half ago when the AMA's executive
vice president, E. Ratcliffe Anderson, announced that he was firing
Lundberg for a series of offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The only one he would discuss, however, was an article published
last week that focused on a survey of 600 college students, a
substantial majority of which agreed with President Clinton's
contention that oral-genital contact does not constitute ``having
sex.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey was designed to alert doctors to the possibility that
young patients could be engaging in behavior that would put them at
risk of getting a sexually transmitted disease.
</P>
<P>
   Running the story just as Clinton's Senate impeachment trial was
starting, Anderson said, amounted to ``inappropriately and
inexcusably interjecting JAMA into a major political debate that
has nothing to do with science or medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Lundberg's defenders have rallied to his cause,
saying that his 17-year tenure has elevated JAMA from an AMA
mouthpiece to one of the world's most respected medical journals.
They also said that the AMA, which represents fewer than 40 percent
of America's doctors _ down from 90 percent in the 1950s _ will
probably see its prestige and membership sink even further.
</P>
<P>
   ``The AMA would rather be dead than read,'' said Dr. Raymond
Scalettar of Washington, who chaired the association's board in
1992-93 and has led unsuccessful bids to revamp the organization.
``JAMA was the jewel in the crown of the AMA, it easily outshone
the AMA and had worldwide respect. That's why this whole thing is a
mortal blow.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Horton, editor of the influential British journal
Lancet, agreed, saying in an editorial last week that the AMA was
only beginning to recover from a 1997 scandal in which it made _
then canceled _ a deal to provide exclusive endorsements of
products made by Sunbeam Corp. in return for millions in royalty
payments. Now the Lundberg firing has ``brought the AMA to what
most observers thought was impossible _ a new and sinking low in
its history,'' Horton wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only one way to begin the repair of the AMA's most
important asset. Anderson must now go, voluntarily or by the
decisive action of the association's Board of Trustees.''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, the dismissal has been the leading subject of
conversation at academic medical meetings and in hospital dressing
rooms. ``It was a very stupid thing for the AMA to do,'' Dr. James
Reinertsen, chief executive of the parent company that runs the
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of prominent medical leaders are considering
resigning from the AMA, myself included.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tom Delbanco, a Harvard professor who writes the Clinical
Crossroads column in JAMA, predicted that ``you're seeing the
beginnings of an avalanche that will inexorably lead to Anderson's
leaving . . . Unless something happens soon, I do not see how I can
continue to lead Clinical Crossroads if it continues to be
published in JAMA.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Anderson Sunday were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Lundberg, reached at his Chicago home Sunday, declined to
comment but said in a prepared statement that he is ``enormously
grateful for the outpouring of support from leaders of medicine,
both in America and throughout the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickey, the AMA boss, said that ``there was an expectation there
would be some response to the decision we made, but that comes with
the territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she continues to have confidence in Anderson, who
runs the group day-to-day, she added, ``absolutely.''

STARS SHINE IN ALL-STAR GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Only Wayne Gretzky could have stolen the spotlight
from the Stars yesterday, but darned if ``The Great One'' didn't do
just that.
</P>
<P>
   Just two days shy of his 38th birthday, Gretzky tied the league
record by winning his third All-Star Game most valuable player
award in leading the North America All-Stars to an 8-6 victory at
the Ice Palace.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the spectrum of Gretzky's magic, however, was a subtle
sign the Stars might indeed be ``the team to watch'' in the NHL.
Mike Modano had a goal and three assists and was among the top
three in the MVP balloting, Sergei Zubov and Darryl Sydor each
scored goals, and coach Ken Hitchcock finally unloaded a monkey the
size of ``Mighty Joe Young'' by winning for the first time in 12
All-Star game appearances.
</P>
<P>
   In all, it made for a Stars-studded weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says a lot about how far our organization has come,''
Modano said. ``It says a lot about where we're going, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano earned praise as one of the league's ``elite players.''
Zubov was so good, World Team coach Lindy Ruff played him 23
minutes and 13 seconds _ more than any other player in the game.
Sydor continually made good things happen as he made a strong case
for himself as a realistic candidate for the Norris Trophy, given
to the league's best defenseman. And goalie Ed Belfour held the
fort in the third period as Hitchcock finally won an All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe now you guys can burn that tape of ``Ground Hog Day'',''
Hitchcock joked of the movie in which Bill Murray lives the same
nightmare every day.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ruff, how did he feel to be the first to lose to
Hitchcock in an All-Star game?
</P>
<P>
   ``Totally embarassed,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of day when the Stars could afford to laugh.
Even though they are in a season-worst 2-4-1 slump, they took a
break and remembered how good they can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of talent on our team,'' Modano said. ``That's a
nice change from the days in \RMinnesota\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky, however, proved to be the most mesmerizing talent. He
had a goal and two assists, and his greatest moment on the ice
didn't even result in a goal. With about four minutes remaining in
the game, Gretzky and linemates Mark Recchi of the Montreal
Canadiens and Theo Fleury of the Calgary Flames took the puck into
the offensive zone and simply wouldn't let the World Team take it
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shift, he was out there a minute and a half and he had
the puck the whole time,'' said Sydor, who was Gretzky's teammate
on the Los Angeles Kings four years ago. ``He's still The Great
One.''
</P>
<P>
   There is some speculation that this could be Gretzky's final
All-Star game, but he said, ``I thought the same thing last year,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   He leads the New York Rangers in scoring with 42 points, and
Modano said, ``if he keeps playing the way he did tonight, he can
play for five more years.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky acknowledged the night was a little emotional. He won a
1999 Dodge Durango for being named the MVP and unlike the countless
other award cars that he has given away, he said he's going to keep
this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a memento to me, it's kind of like a trophy,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky continues to be seen as the sport's greatest ambassador,
and even the players treated him with some awe. Flyers center Eric
Lindros gave up his spot in the starting lineup for Gretzky, and
Modano said of having a dressing stall near Gretzky, ``you really
do have to kind of pinch yourself when it's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   But on this day, the entire Stars organization was pinching
itself. Modano opened the game's scoring on two-time MVP Dominik
Hasek and assisted on goals by Paul Kariya, Ray Bourque and Sydor.
Sydor scored his goal at the 4:02 mark of the third period to give
the North America Team an 8-5 cushion. And Zubov scored his goal at
the 4:20 mark of the third, giving the World Team a chance to get
back in the game and doing against teammate Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   And Hitchcock finally won an All-Star game, meaning he might be
so happy, the team might not have to skate sprints again for at
least a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have brought a dictaphone and some videotape, because
he was a completely different guy here,'' Sydor said of Hitchcock's
typically rough game face. ``The guys back home wouldn't have
believed it.''

MODANO TURNS IN MVP PERFORMANCE, BUT FINISHES RUNNER-UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Mike Modano yesterday walked off the ice and
cursed his luck _ not what you'd expect from a guy who just tallied
a goal and three assists in an NHL All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   On any other day, Modano likely would have been the most
valuable player and would have taken home the corresponding Dodge
Durango. On this occasion, though, he had to a take a back seat to
Wayne Gretzky, the New York Rangers center who stole Modano's
thunder by winning his third All-Star game MVP.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just being out there with him was great,'' Modano said of his
consolation prize of finishing second to Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   But transportation issues aside, the Stars' leading scorer might
have walked out of the Ice Palace with something of greater value
than a new truck. He walked out with even greater respect from his
peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was funny being on the bench because guys were talking
about the moves he made or a pass he made, and they were kind of
amazed,'' Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor said. ``He's really one of
the, I mean he is, he is an elite player, there's no two ways about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano, who has never had a problem scoring against Buffalo
Sabres goalie Dominik Hasek, gave team North America a boost by
scoring the first goal at the 4:09 mark of the first period. Modano
was cycling on a shift with linemates Paul Kariya and Luc
Robitaille when he swooped in on Hasek and stole a rebound from
just out of the reach of the two-time NHL MVP.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a lot of fun to play with. I know I'd pay to watch him,''
Robitaille said. ``He's growing as a player, and he's really taken
over that team. You know now when you go to play Dallas, you have
to stop him because he is the man for that team.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Modano was just short of being ``the man'' for team
North America. In addition to the goal, he set up Tony Amonte for a
strong shot that Kariya turned into a rebound goal, set up Boston
Bruins legend Ray Bourque for a second-period goal and gave Sydor
the helper on a third-period goal that provided an 8-5 cushion for
the North Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In between, he showed those familiar bursts of speed, his innate
ability to move the puck around defensemen as if it's glued to his
stick and that smooth passing style that helps raise the level of
his linemates.
</P>
<P>
   And, ironically enough, he even showed the thing that might
define him as an All-Star _ strong defensive play. That's almost
unheard of in this kind of exhibition, but it's become second
nature for Modano.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really made a big step two or three years ago when he
became a stronger two-way player and started to stress defense just
as much as offense,'' Sydor said. ``You could see a big jump in his
play then.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, though, he's taking another step up,'' Sydor added.
``He's a strong two-way player and he's taking it even farther than
that. He's up there with the best players right now.''

WANT A NEW OLYMPIC JOKE? YOU'RE STUCK WITH OLD ONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Feigning deep remorse, the graybeards of the
International Olympic Committee rounded up the usual suspects _ in
this case, ex-diplomats and friends-of-the-king without leverage _
and tried to turn the page yesterday on ``the ugliest chapter'' in
Olympic history.
</P>
<P>
   Six IOC members were told to turn in their platinum MasterCards
and autographed ``Playboys'' of Katarina Witt. Further, Inspector
Clouseau-like investigations are said to follow.
</P>
<P>
   I'm kidding about the credit cards and the Katarina photos. I
think.
</P>
<P>
   But was anyone really surprised when, after an exhaustive probe
_ two weeks to investigate an organization that has been around for
103 years _ the IOC panel found a handful of bad apples to wear its
scarlet letter?
</P>
<P>
   The same strategy has been employed in more-moral-than-thou
Utah, where the governor has vowed to clean up everything short of
original sin.
</P>
<P>
   At least in Salt Lake City, there are some consciences that have
taken a beating in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   The same, I suspect, probably can't be said in Lausanne,
Switzerland, where the IOC rules over everything good and decent
and Olympic. While distancing himself from the three resigned
members and the six that were threatened yesterday with expulsion,
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch announced plans for a new
method of selecting the Olympic host city _ with Samaranch himself
presiding over the new process.
</P>
<P>
   Resign? Samaranch would no sooner resign than shoot his foot
with one of those gift shotguns.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, editorial writers from London to Beijing are suggesting
just that _ that surely, Samaranch had to know that certain Olympic
votes were up for sale, and that surely he knew the IOC was
drowning in a pool of chauffeured excess.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the IOC report, a personal favorite came from the
``London Daily Telegraph'', which wrote, ``So far a series of leaks
and press reports has stripped the IOC half-naked of its dignity,
but today it will be the full monty.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch reportedly speaks five languages. But to him, all this
is just so much blah-blah-blah.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch isn't going anywhere. He is 78. He knows where every
Olympic skeleton since Milon of Kroton is buried. And if he were,
by some act of God, to quit, who could step in and take his place?
</P>
<P>
   As recent reports suggest, there are under-the-table
site-selection deals, under-the-table TV deals, under-the-table
Olympic museum deals and, more than likely, under-the-table
under-the-table deals.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch is one of the most visible figures on the planet. He
is the Don Corleone of the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   If Samaranch falls on his gift sword for this vote-buying
scandal, there isn't another IOC name, face or figurehead _ Prince
Albert of Monaco included _ who could assume the group's presidency
and salvage what really matters here: sponsor money.
</P>
<P>
   If Samaranch resigns, he becomes (pick one) ``deposed/disgraced
former IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch,'' and that's not going
to compel Xerox or Snickers to dig any deeper for next month's
sponsorship checks.
</P>
<P>
   His term ends in 2001, when Samaranch will be 81, and perhaps an
orderly transition could be enacted. But there we go, asking the
IOC to vote on something again.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the media won't let this story go. It has all the
elements of a juicy scandal _ rich people, bribes, sex, wounded
piety. It would make a marvelous TV mini-series.
</P>
<P>
   But when the opening of a wire service story calls it ``the
biggest corruption scandal in the history of the games,'' there's a
javelin out of bounds somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   One more time, remember that these city bid committees are
private groups, operating with privately raised funds. They are
being charged with making excessive gifts to people of privilege,
who are used to accepting lavish privileges.
</P>
<P>
   No laws have likely been broken. It just looks awfully seedy.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC, again a private organization, can award the Olympic
Games to any city it chooses. Barcelona was a world-class Olympic
host in 1992. Lillehammer proved to be a true global village.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us, on the other hand, think giving Atlanta the games in
1996 bordered on sinful. But that doesn't mean I think Atlanta
bribed anyone for votes.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC yesterday gave the (gasp) scandal the treatment it felt
it deserved.
</P>
<P>
   It rounded up the usual suspects. It slapped wrists. It pledged
a new and moral beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Blah, blah, blah.

BASHING GOVERNOR'S IDEOLOGICAL CONCEPT IS WRONG (For use by NYTimes
News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leave it to Republicans to be handed a sure-fire formula for
winning elections and promptly turn it into a recipe for defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Old Party fumbled away the Reagan majority in
presidential elections, set fire to the ``Republican revolution''
of 1994 and now seems to be taking aim at the best thing to happen
to Republicans in years: compassionate conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   It should surprise absolutely no one that former Vice President
Dan Quayle launched his campaign for the Republican presidential
nomination by condemning the concept that carried Texas Gov. George
W. Bush to a spectacular re-election victory last fall. Quayle
wouldn't recognize a good idea if it bit him on the nose.
</P>
<P>
   So it figures that this man who is best known for being a dolt
would dismiss compassionate conservatism as ``silly and
insulting.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Quayle for you. Once a nitwit, always a nitwit.
</P>
<P>
   But we might have expected more from Republican hopefuls Lamar
Alexander and Steve Forbes, both of whom used a meeting of
conservative activists last week to rip Bush and the compassionate
conservatism that he embraced so successfully in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander ridiculed ``compassionate conservatism'' as ``weasel
words'' that mean nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what Forbes said, as quoted by the Fort Worth
Star-Telegram:
</P>
<P>
   ``Mealy-mouthed rhetoric and poll-tested cliches are no
substitute for a muscular, substantive agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes even took a shot at the governor's father, blasting
former President Bush for his ``kinder, gentler'' approach to
politics and government.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the bumper stickers: ``Muscle yes, compassion no _ vote
for Forbes.''
</P>
<P>
   No one, not even an ardent Bush backer such as myself, would
begrudge underdog candidates their constitutional right to attack
the front-runner in the race for the GOP nomination. That's the way
the game is played.
</P>
<P>
   But for Quayle, Alexander and Forbes to cavalierly _ no, nastily
_ attack the idea of compassionate conservatism just because it's
identified with Bush is so stupidly self-defeating as to suggest
that these guys are way over their heads in the big leagues of
presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle was way over his head just having lunch in the White
House, of course, but that's another story.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, any Republican who wants to be president should be
jumping onto the compassionate conservatism bandwagon, not trying
to derail it.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not Bush decides to run for president, he has paved
the way for the Republican candidate _ whoever it turns out to be _
to win the election. The Texas governor obviously understands what
too many of his fellow Republicans don't: Bill Clinton was elected
to two terms as president of the United States because he knows how
to market compassion.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans have come to believe that Clinton cares about
them and their problems. For these people, the compassion they see
in Clinton outweighs all of his character flaws and all of his
private and public misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's compassion for his fellow Americans, whether it's real
or merely perceived, is the reason he has survived every scandal
and every charge of wrongdoing. Clinton's compassion is the reason
he enjoys sky-high approval ratings even as he stands trial in the
Senate on articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans chose a highly qualified candidate, Bob Dole, to
oppose Clinton in 1996. In every poll, Dole obliterated Clinton
when voters were asked to compare the candidates in terms of
honesty, integrity, trustworthiness.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton obliterated Dole in every poll when voters were
asked: Which candidate cares more about people like you?
</P>
<P>
   Call it the compassion gap. George W. Bush closed the compassion
gap in Texas, as well as the gender gap and most of the other
electoral ``gaps'' that have plagued Republican candidates in
recent years. Bush racked up nearly 70 percent of the vote while
appealing to virtually every voter group that lends itself to
grouping.
</P>
<P>
   If Quayle thinks that such election results are ``silly and
insulting,'' then he needs to get out of the election business.
</P>
<P>
   And he needs to take Alexander and Forbes with him.

BASHING GOVERNOR'S IDEOLOGICAL CONCEPT IS WRONG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leave it to Republicans to be handed a sure-fire formula for
winning elections and promptly turn it into a recipe for defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Old Party fumbled away the Reagan majority in
presidential elections, set fire to the ``Republican revolution''
of 1994 and now seems to be taking aim at the best thing to happen
to Republicans in years: compassionate conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   It should surprise absolutely no one that former Vice President
Dan Quayle launched his campaign for the Republican presidential
nomination by condemning the concept that carried Texas Gov. George
W. Bush to a spectacular re-election victory last fall. Quayle
wouldn't recognize a good idea if it bit him on the nose.
</P>
<P>
   So it figures that this man who is best known for being a dolt
would dismiss compassionate conservatism as ``silly and
insulting.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Quayle for you. Once a nitwit, always a nitwit.
</P>
<P>
   But we might have expected more from Republican hopefuls Lamar
Alexander and Steve Forbes, both of whom used a meeting of
conservative activists last week to rip Bush and the compassionate
conservatism that he embraced so successfully in Texas.

BULL'S-EYES FROM BUMPERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; -- Trivia freaks will recall that it started with a
necktie. Serious students should never forget that near the end of
the country's second impeachment trial of a president _ a
proceeding even more embarrassing and shameful than the first one _
the necktie was supplanted as metaphor by a marble statuette of a
bear's head.
</P>
<P>
   We shook our heads at the necktie. But in the Senate last week,
heads nodded at Dale Bumpers's tale of the bear's head, because by
then what had once been odd had become familiar; what was a weird
stretch in August had become by January par for the course.
</P>
<P>
   First, the necktie. It was a gift from Monica Lewinsky to
President Clinton. Five months ago, as she was beginning her grand
jury testimony, she noticed that Clinton was wearing it during a
Rose Garden appearance. She said she wondered if he was sending her
a signal. Lewinsky's fixation is human, but what caused heads to
shake was the fact that Ken Starr and his prosecutors took her
seriously and put this absurdity on the record once they had the
president under oath.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Dale Bumpers spoke, however, the context had
changed. With the examples now legion of zeal gone mad, evidence
buried, connections manufactured out of thin air, and inferences
piled on top of conjecture, nothing could surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's choice of Bumpers, a former senator for only three
weeks after representing Arkansas for four terms, was inspired. The
press reports of a long friendship didn't fool Bumpers's former
colleagues. They knew that he and the president had mostly been
sharp-elbowed rivals in Arkansas, that this was a beloved club
member taking a stand for his favorite cause, the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   And Bumpers's one foray into the impeachment's case's
``evidence'' was similarly inspired. It wasn't technical, or even
richly prohibitive, merely all-revealing.
</P>
<P>
   The marble bear's head was of Native American origin, and we
know from Starr's hyper-diligence that the president brought it
back from Vancouver just before Thanksgiving, 1997. And then, in a
bag of other trinkets from the Black Dog on Martha's Vineyard, we
also know he gave it to Lewinsky on one of the case's most
important dates, Dec. 28.
</P>
<P>
   As White House deputy counsel Cheryl Mills had established in
her brilliant presentation the day before, the only evidence is
that it was Lewinsky who was worried about gifts and an invasion of
her apartment by Paula Jones's lawyers. At least for those
referring to actual evidence, Clinton didn't give a hoot about
them. But in Starr's world, gifts are not gifts, but signals.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, in the grand jury, Lewinsky was asked if he told
her anything about what they were now calling the Vancouver Bear.
She said: ``I think he, I believe he said, that the bear is the
maybe Indian symbol for strength, you know, and to be strong like a
bear.''
</P>
<P>
   And now the big moment.
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``And did you interpret that to be strong in your decision to
continue to conceal the relationship?''
</P>
<P>
   A: ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   One is tempted to quote Clinton attorney David Kendall's acidic
question about Lewinsky's more famous ``No one ever asked me to lie
and I was never promised a job for my silence. Is there something
difficult to understand here?'' But the House Judiciary Committee
refused to take no for an answer. In its impeachment report to the
full House, the fact that Clinton gave gifts on the same occasion
he allegedly obstructed justice by trying to hide other gifts
``seems odd,'' but the committee said the answer can be found in
Lewinsky's testimony. ``The only logical inference,'' the committee
asserted, ``is that the gifts, including the bear symbolizing
strength, were a tacit reminder to Lewinsky that they would deny
the relationship even in the face of a federal subpoena.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee then repeated this falsehood in its official trial
brief to the Senate. It may be the House's problem if its Judiciary
Committee slings bull at the full membership, but you have to be a
taco short of a combination plate to sling documentable bull at the
final arbiters.
</P>
<P>
   Rubbing it in a bit thickly, Bumpers went on: ``Is it perjury to
say that the only logical inference is something when the only
shred of testimony in the record is `no, that was not my
interpretation?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, of course, that's not perjury,'' Bumpers said after
establishing its moral equivalent, but he added in the vernacular
of one pol addressing a hundred others: ``I'll tell you what it is,
it's wanting to win too badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Bulls-eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``There a total lack of proportionality, a total lack of balance
in this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bulls-eye.
</P>
<P>
   The White House legal presentation included more than dozen
examples of this that were far more probitive _ from cellphone
calls at the wrong time, to falsified times of the day for court
orders, to contrary inferences drawn in spite of explicit evidence
to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   But Bumpers's sense of the Senate led him to another buried tale
that was as much metaphor as outrage. The fact that the Vancouver
Bear saga was more vignette than evidence only added to its impact.
</P>
<P>
   Any senator who has ever fudged a fact, made one up, gone
overboard, miscast an aspersion, or slung bull (now we're talking
the whole chamber) could grasp Bumpers's point.
</P>
<P>
   Know your audience, they teach; it's the essential step in
convincing it.

COUPLE BATTLE OVER RIGHTS TO CHILD BORN FROM FROZEN EMBRYO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Miss.) 
 
(Photos available on NYT database) 
 
By RON NISSIMOV 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ As he scraped to survive as a teen-ager in rural
Arkansas 50 years ago, sleeping under cardboard boxes and killing
cockroaches for a penny apiece, Don McGill swore he would be a
better man than his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not having a relationship with my father made me convinced if
I ever had children, I would be a good father to them,'' said
McGill, whose father left home when McGill was a year old. ``I
didn't want to have children till I knew I could take care of them.
I promised myself I would never leave a child like my dad left
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mildred Barrett, born 20 years after McGill, also frequently
thought about her father as a teen-ager. But she felt only
admiration for ``Daddy,'' a stalwart figure in the tiny town of
Lexington, Miss., who was elected county prosecutor for 35 years
and revered for his moral leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy, along with Mama, gave us a home that was a refuge, full
of love, laughter, learning, compassion, sharing and optimism,''
she said in a eulogy for her father's Dec. 26 funeral. He was a man
so popular that ``people were waiting outside the church because
they couldn't get in,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage of McGill and Barrett in 1976 _ and their different
visions for what a father should be _ have them embroiled in a
bizarre dispute over a child born from a frozen embryo that could
help shape the legal definition of a parent. The legal issues are
modern, but the underlying themes of jealousy, betrayal and
Southern mores are straight out of ``a Tennessee Williams play,''
said McGill's attorney, Roy W. Moore.
</P>
<P>
   McGill, who grew up dirt poor and dropped out of school in the
third grade to work, vaulted to wealth after helping found Don
McGill Toyota in Houston in the late 1960s. He met Barrett after
hiring her father and brothers in the mid-1970s as attorneys to
represent him in a Mississippi land dispute. Barrett came to work
for McGill at his dealership, and they married a short time later.

   By the 1990s the couple had three children, but their marriage
had been on the rocks for many years primarily because of McGill's
infidelity. For birth-control purposes, Mildred McGill had her
fallopian tubes tied after their third child. In an attempt to save
the marriage, they agreed in 1994 to try to have a fourth child by
undergoing in vitro fertilization with her eggs and his sperm.
Fourteen embryos were produced and frozen, to be implanted in
Mildred McGill's womb with the help of hormone treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt trapped, the only thing that brought joy to me was my
children,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She tried three times unsuccessfully to impregnate herself with
the frozen embryos while she was still married. Fed up after
catching McGill once more with another woman, she divorced him in
August 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, she was implanted with the four remaining
embryos. This time, the procedure worked. A daughter named Grace
was born June 25, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In September of that same year, she married developer Jim Schmit
of Redmond, Ore. Today, she is trying to deny her ex-husband
parental rights to 18-month-old Grace on the grounds that their
divorce relegated his status from father to sperm donor.
</P>
<P>
   According to lawyers involved in the case, it is the first time
such a legal claim has been raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was as devastated as you could be, it felt like somebody
came into your house and stole your child,'' said McGill about his
ex-wife's actions.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Texas' Harris County Family Law Judge Don Ritter ruled
that McGill is Grace's legal father. Following a contentious
eight-day trial in April, a jury granted Mildred Schmit primary
custody of the girl and gave McGill weekend visitation rights. The
decisions have been appealed by Schmit.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the legal dispute are polar opposite stories
about the agreement over the embryos McGill and Schmit entered into
after their divorce.
</P>
<P>
   McGill claims that he allowed Schmit to undergo the embryo
implant in October 1996 on the condition that he would have
parental rights. But one week after Grace was born, he said, his
ex-wife reneged on the deal because she learned that McGill planned
to marry a woman Schmit called a ``whore.'' He said Schmit no
longer allowed him to see Grace and challenged him to ``sue me''
over parental rights, which he did in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Schmit called McGill's story ``absurd'' and said they had such a
miserable marriage that she made it clear she wanted to raise the
child as a single parent and did not expect him to pay child
support for Grace. She said he gladly agreed, but changed his mind
to spite her after he found out she was engaged to Jim Schmit.
</P>
<P>
   ``What motivates Don is the same thing that motivates O.J.
Simpson _ power and control,'' Mildred Schmit said from her modest
home in Lexington, Miss., which served as her family's servant's
quarters when she grew up. ``How dare I get on with my life and be
with another man.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmit claims that McGill has so far succeeded in ruining her
happiness. Soon after she moved to Oregon in October 1997 to be
with her new husband, she said, McGill ``bought a mansion'' nearby
to harass them. Because of two incidents in McGill's past that made
her uncomfortable and because the Schmits inexplicably found a
telephone wire cut and balled up in their home, Schmit said she
decided to move back to Lexington in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Although she sees her new husband only a few times a month
because of the distance separating them, she said she feels safer
in Lexington because her brothers and sister live there. Soon after
Schmit moved to Mississippi, however, McGill bought a home there,
too.
</P>
<P>
   McGill said the only reason he bought the homes is to spend as
much quality time as possible during weekend visitations with Grace
and his 10-year-old daughter, Rebecca, who both live with Schmit.
He said he had nothing to do with the cut wire, and the fact that
his ex-wife has chosen to live away from Jim Schmit &UR;  &LR; is proof to
him that she married him on the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`THIS IS A TRAILBLAZING CASE' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since the advent of in vitro fertilization in the late 1970s,
laws have evolved to address the disposition of frozen embryos
produced by a married couple who later divorce. Texas, like many
states, requires couples to put their intentions in writing.
</P>
<P>
   McGill and Schmit wrote down that they would agree at the time
of divorce what to do with their embryos, but no subsequent written
agreement was ever signed. Each now contends that an oral agreement
was reached on their respective claims and that they have witnesses
to back them up.
</P>
<P>
   There have been two highly publicized cases this decade, in
Tennessee and New York, involving divorced couples who earlier had
produced embryos in vitro. In both cases, the women wanted to
implant themselves after the divorce, but the men said they had the
right to stop the procedure because they did not want to be fathers
if they were not married.
</P>
<P>
   The highest courts in both states prevented the women from
acting without permission from their ex-husbands. In both
decisions, the embryos were considered property rather than
children.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, that distinction is moot because the child has
been born. It is the only known instance in which an embryo
produced by a married couple developed into a child after a divorce
without a written agreement on parental rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a trailblazing case,'' said Schmit's attorney, Earle
Lilly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I tell 100 people that during marriage a father's sperm
fertilized a mother's egg and subsequently a child was born, 90
percent of ordinary people would say of course the father is
entitled to parental rights,'' Lilly said. ``But when I tell them
the facts of this case, it becomes 50-50.''

GETTING EVEN VIA `HACKTIVISM' 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, several members of a hacking group called
Legions of the Underground declared an ``electronic war'' against
China and Iraq. Citing violations of human rights, the hackers
vowed to punish those countries by destroying their computer
systems.
</P>
<P>
   This virtual call to arms went largely unnoticed by most of the
world, and the threat of destruction never materialized. But it
created an uproar in the cyber underground: A coalition of hacking
groups, known for their staunch independence and insular rivalries,
issued an unprecedented joint statement condemning the audacious
declaration and ``any attempt to use hacking to threaten or destroy
the information infrastructure of any country.'' Legions of
Underground quickly backed down.
</P>
<P>
   The incident intensified an ongoing debate about ``hacktivism''
_ the use of computers to advance political causes. The term,
coined in recent months, covers everything from animal rights
groups defacing the Web pages of fur companies to the use of
computers by dissidents to promote democracy in totalitarian
regimes. Targeted Web sites have included government pages of
Indonesia and India, Mexico and China, as well as sites operated by
NASA, the US Army, and the Department of Defense. The tools range
from legitimate e-mail campaigns to on-line graffiti to software
programs with names like Back Orifice and Floodnet.
</P>
<P>
   Political activists, who until recently got their message across
through rallies and marches and sit-ins and slogans, are taking
their causes on line in record numbers; they are now engaging in
what they call ``electronic civil disobedience.'' At the same time,
however, young hackers in their teens and early 20s are defacing
Web sites and, apparently as an afterthought, attaching a political
cause to their efforts. Such actions worry activists and veteran
hackers alike, and raise several thorny questions:
</P>
<P>
   What are the limits of political protest in cyberspace, where
the boundaries between public and private space are murky? How far
can activists go without infringing on the rights of the people
they are protesting? As international reliance on computer
technology increases, can anyone with a little technical know-how
declare their own war?
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, varying views on those questions stem from the
tension inherent between members of two generations. The older
hackers _ many of whom hold jobs and have families, and are known
as the ``elites'' _ fear trouble on the horizon. Meanwhile, some of
the youngsters _ called ``script kiddies,'' a term to describe
cyberpunks who borrow other people's programs to seek on-line
thrills _ have no such reservations.
</P>
<P>
   But at the very least, the emergence of hacktivism has created a
tentative esprit de corps among some hackers and nonprofit
political groups, who until recently inhabited vastly different
worlds. Consider what happened in October: A 25-year-old computer
science student who goes by the name Bronc Buster hacked into
China's official human rights Web site on the day it was launched.
He scrawled the words ``Boycott China,'' along with a screed
riddled with obscenities, across the page and added links to such
legitimate activist organizations as Amnesty International and the
New York-based group Human Rights in China.
</P>
<P>
   Bronc Buster, who does not give his real name and is a member of
Legions of the Underground who criticized the war declaration, said
in a telephone interview that he studied contemporary China in a
college course and was motivated by both his outrage over human
rights abuse and the fact that the Chinese computer system was
``pathetically easy'' to crack. ``Everything I read on that site
was total baloney,'' he said. ``The idea of human rights in China
is like the Nazis saying the Holocaust never happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Xiao Qiang, executive director of Human Rights in China, a
dissident group founded after the 1989 Tianamen Square massacre,
said he does not endorse such political techniques but that his
group benefited from the attention. His group's Web site, which
chronicles human rights abuses, received 5,000 hits the day after
the hack and signed up scores of new members. ``They certainly did
a brave thing in terms of exposing the Chinese government
propaganda site,'' Qiang said. ``We don't officially encourage
hacking activities, but it certainly helped our cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Steinhardt, outgoing president of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation and associate director of the American Civil Liberties
Union, says that electronic civil disobedience in the United States
may be well-motivated, but it also may be an act of vandalism. An
FBI spokesperson in Washington said there are no closed
investigations to date, but Steinhardt predicts that test cases are
inevitable _ and perhaps imminent.
</P>
<P>
   More and more hackers, particularly the older generation who got
their kicks breaking into computer systems in the '70s and '80s,
are becoming more politically motivated. ``It's a natural
evolution,'' said Emmanuel Goldstein, editor of the hacking
magazine 2600 and a member of the coalition that condemned the
recent ``cyber war'' call. ``People believe in something, and they
do anything they can to get the word out.''

</P>
<P>
   Moore, McGill's lawyer, argues that a ``common-sense approach''
should be used to resolve the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mildred ignores that the eggs were fertilized during her
marriage to Don and that Don was her husband at the time of
fertilization,'' said a legal brief he submitted. ``She also
ignores (that) this theory is in conflict with her own sworn belief
`that life begins at conception,' and ... `that the circumstances
of her divorce were not the fault of these innocent embryos.'''
</P>
<P>
   In ruling that McGill was the legal father, Ritter said, ``I
don't think anyone would have ever thought'' a paternity lawsuit
such as this would arise. No state law addressed this particular
set of circumstances, but Ritter said he believed the Texas
Legislature intended that children born through artificial means
``have parents'' and it was important ``to figure out a way to get
it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas law regarding married couples who undergo in vitro
fertilization says the husband is the father regardless of whether
the embryo is produced with sperm from the husband or from a donor.
However, it does not say what happens if the implant occurs after
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, Ritter did not base his ruling on the in vitro
law, but on Texas' artificial insemination statute. In this
procedure, semen is artificially inseminated into a woman's uterus.
</P>
<P>
   The first section of that law states: ``If a husband consents to
the artificial insemination of his wife, any resulting child is the
child of both of them. The consent must be in writing and be
acknowledged.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritter said McGill ``consented to (in vitro fertilization) in
writing, acknowledged (it), and they were married at the time that
it was made.''
</P>
<P>
   But another section of the statute says: ``If a woman is
artificially inseminated, the resulting child is not the child of
the donor unless he is the husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Lilly argued that since embryos can be frozen for years after in
vitro fertilization, the proper way to apply the artificial
insemination law is by examining the marital status of the man and
woman at the time of implantation, not fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   He concluded that under this logic, McGill should have been
considered a donor, not a husband.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Lilly said, the only issue that should have determined
paternity was the agreement reached between McGill and Schmit.
Since the nature of the agreement is in dispute, he said, a jury
should have decided who is more trustworthy instead of having a
judge rule that McGill is the legal parent.
</P>
<P>
   Moore claims that under Texas law, McGill is Grace's legal
father because he is named on her birth certificate and he signed a
statement of paternity three months after her birth. Lilly said
those laws are irrelevant to this case because the birth was
artificially induced.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly said if the judge's decision stands, it could set a
dangerous precedent by opening the door for sperm donors to be
forced to be parents or pay child support.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DIFFERENT EXPECTATIONS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With his 6-foot-4-inch frame and muscular build, McGill remains
an imposing physical presence at age 64. But despite his
no-nonsense demeanor, McGill said he cried the first time Grace
called him ``Dad'' recently.
</P>
<P>
   Schmit scoffed at what she believes is another lie from her
ex-husband, saying Grace barely talks and has never uttered the
word ``Dad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At her age, she sees any man who spends 10 minutes with her as
a father figure,'' said Schmit.
</P>
<P>
   The two seem to disagree on almost everything, including the
value of their divorce settlement. Schmit claims that McGill, who
owns Toyota, Audi and Porsche dealerships and whose estimated worth
is $120 million, gave her $4 million in property and cash, and much
of that is spread over 20 years. McGill said his ex-wife's
settlement is worth $32 million over that time.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the animosity arises out of their different expectations
of fatherhood.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, Schmit knew McGill would have a tough time
measuring up to her ``Daddy.'' As McGill courted Schmit (then
Mildred Barrett), he made sure she understood he came from the
other side of the tracks, and even confided he had participated in
an armed robbery at age 15 and spent two years in reform school for
it in Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   (McGill said he was talked into the robbery by an older cousin
when he had no money or job prospects and that he did not carry the
gun. He said he learned his lesson, never again committed a crime
and received a presidential pardon in 1967 from Lyndon B. Johnson.
He also noted that it was an instructor at the reformatory who
steered him toward the car business.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got this savior deal,'' Schmit said about marrying
McGill. ``I was going to save him, to be the only one who loved
him.''
</P>
<P>
   But she soon realized McGill would not be the moral pillar her
father was.
</P>
<P>
   Schmit said that, from the beginning, her ex-husband had
numerous affairs and frequently lied to cover them up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wouldn't be home with me and the children for Thanksgiving,
and he would say, `I'm meeting with Germans about Audis, and
Germans don't celebrate Thanksgiving,''' Schmit said. ``Or he
wouldn't be with us for Easter and said, `I'm meeting with Jews,
and they don't celebrate Easter, do they?'''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A `TERRIBLE' THING &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, five months pregnant with their first child, Schmit
(then Mildred McGill) got a call from her husband. He told her
``something terrible happened,'' and asked her to fly to San
Francisco to stay with relatives. She said McGill told her he would
meet her there in a couple of days to explain. ``Do you trust me?''
she recalled him saying.
</P>
<P>
   What had happened was indeed ``terrible.'' Nancy Poteet, a
former Playboy model McGill had lived with before he married, had
been found dead in her home in Winnsboro, Texas, of a shotgun blast
to her mouth. McGill was at Poteet's house at the time.
</P>
<P>
   He was investigated for a possible role, but Poteet's death was
ruled a suicide and McGill was not charged with any crime.
</P>
<P>
   McGill said Poteet was distraught that he did not want to
continue his relationship with her, and killed herself after he
pleaded, ``Nancy, that's not the answer to anything.'' But Poteet's
family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against McGill accusing him
of stalking her and committing ``a heinous murder.''
</P>
<P>
   McGill in turn sued Poteet's father over a land dispute, and
both lawsuits were dropped without any monetary settlement, said
Helen Poteet, the dead woman's mother.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`JUDGE ME HOW YOU WILL' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Schmit said McGill has never physically abused her, but she
cited Poteet's suicide and the half-century-old armed robbery as
the reasons she fears McGill.
</P>
<P>
   McGill said he had only two affairs while married to Schmit, but
acknowledged that he was ``a better father than husband.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have said many times to my children, `I'm doing the best I
can. Nobody gave me directions. She (Schmit) was raised by parents,
I wasn't,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he grew up in extreme poverty because his mother, who
worked at a sock factory, was often too sick to work or take care
of him. He said his older sister was supposed to watch out for him,
but he spent many days and nights on the street because ``she could
barely take care of herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmit said she grew tired of her ex-husband's excuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor people have the choice to be moral,'' she said. ``Money
means everything to Don. If he loses his money, he loses his
ability to control people.''
</P>
<P>
   McGill, who contributes $70,000 a month to his children's
combined trust fund, said his ex-wife misunderstands his
motivations. He said he has accomplished his top priority as a
father: making sure his kids never have to go through the hardships
he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make a lot of money, thank God,'' he said. ``When I die,
it's all going to my children. Judge me how you will.''

   But some insiders in the hacking world see a need for a
hacktivism strategy that goes beyond on-line graffiti and inflamed
battle rhetoric. ``You may make yourself feel good and get a lot of
attention, but when you crack a Web site, you are violating another
person's rights,'' said a Canadian computer consultant who goes by
the alias Oxblood Ruffin, and is a member of a hacking group called
Cult of the Dead Cow. ``Sure, China is the worst place in the
world, but if we can do that to them, what does that mean? We can
yell louder. We can shout the other guy down. I believe there is a
better way for political dissent. I believe we can make a better
technical argument. We can mount a better moral argument.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some say that political activism could change the negative
public perception of hackers, who are commonly seen as social
misfits. The hacking underground became politicized in 1995,
rallying around the cause of the infamous hacker Kevin Mittnick,
who was arrested in 1995 on charges of obtaining unauthorized
access to corporate computer systems and stealing and copying
proprietary software. Mittnick, who is awaiting trial, had already
done time on similar charges. Many legendary ``hacktivist''
actions, including the break-ins in China, refer to the Mittnick
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do people who are supposedly engaged in political causes
have links to Kevin Mittnick?'' asked Michael A. Vatis, chief of
the FBI's National Infrastructure Protection Center, an agency
formed last year to monitor computer terrorism and oversee FBI
computer-related crime investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's misleading to use the term `hacktivism' to apply to a
broad array of conduct,'' he says. ``People should be more specific
about what they mean. It connotes some sort of legitimacy to what
they are doing, and some people are using it to cloak activity that
is potentially serious and dangerous conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   The members of the Electronic Disturbance Theater are, in fact,
quite precise about their activity, and like political activists
who practice civil disobedience in the real world, they back their
action up by using their real names.
</P>
<P>
   Since last April, they have conducted on-line sit-ins to protest
the Mexican government's treatment of the Zapatistas in Chiapas.
They use a program called Floodnet, which repeatedly requests
access to a targeted Web site, such as the home site of Ernesto
Zedillo, president of Mexico, or the School of the Americas. If
thousands of people run the Floodnet software at the same time, it
could tie up the server so that browsers would not be able to gain
access to a targeted site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to create enough of a disturbance to talk about
what is going on in Mexico,'' said Carmin Karasic, a Quincy digital
artist and computer consultant who is one of the four members of
the collective.
</P>
<P>
   Karasic equates her group's virtual tactics with real-world
sit-ins. ``If we had a civil disturbance at Neponset Circle, you
wouldn't be able to get to my house,'' she said. ``But you wouldn't
think that those people should be arrested. A sit-in means that
someone is going to be inconvenienced. We're trying to push the
limits of political interaction on line.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other ``hacktivists, the members of the Electronic
Disturbance Theater are well-versed in both political and cyber
theory. Their on-line efforts, they say, supplement traditional
forms of political dissent. ``There are things you can do on line
that you can't do in real space and vice versa,'' said Stefan Wray,
a New York-based freelance journalist and graduate student at New
York University. ``On-line, you can't have a virtual sense of group
cohesion or the euphoria or camaraderie that you get with a large
gathering in the real world. But that group of people on the street
doesn't have the speed and sense of interconnectivity at the global
level.''
</P>
<P>
   The group on the street, however, does know the boundaries: If
they choose to throw paint at a nuclear reactor or block access to
a women's health clinic, they are willingly defying the law to
promote their cause. ``In front of a building, you get to play your
First Amendment card all the way to the door before you are dragged
away,'' said Jonathan Zittrain, executive director of Harvard's
Berkman Center for Internet and Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``In cyberspace, you don't have clear public byways intersecting
private spaces, so there is no place to camp out and play your
First Amendment card. If you try to deny service to someone else,
by whatever means you use, you could be in pretty big trouble.''
The FBI spokesperson said that the use of Floodnet could constitute
a federal crime: It is illegal to intentionally block access to an
Internet server. But the members of the collective argue that they
are simply gathering at the gateway, not chaining themselves to the
door.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic Disturbance Theater's activities fall into a gray
area of the law, but one thing is clear: Political activism is
evolving as quickly as the technology itself. Karasic and her
partners are speaking at a national conference on civil
disobedience _ they'll enlighten the group on hacktivism _ that
wraps up Sunday (Jan. 24) at American University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The worlds of the hacker and the activist are interconnecting in
ways that civil rights organizers and antiwar protesters of other
eras could never have foreseen. But members of both groups are
concerned that they don't inadvertently start a war themselves by
prompting zealots or thrill-seekers to mimic their actions and make
sweeping threats like the one issued a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of recent ``war'' declaration by the Legions of the
Underground, the very hacker groups who advocate for free access to
information on the Internet acted to police their own underground
community, condemning the action and issuing a hacktivism manifesto
of sorts at the same time. ``Do not support any acts of cyberwar,''
the statement said. ``Keep the networks of communication alive.
They are the nervous system for human progress.''

AMID HEIGHTENED SEARCH, PLANETS SHOWING UP EVERYWHERE

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Astronomers have now detected at least 17
planets orbiting far-off stars, and the accelerating pace of these
outerspace discoveries is beginning to resemble the explosion of
earthly exploration that Columbus started with his arrival in the
New World.
</P>
<P>
   What began with a slow trickle of one-by-one finds is becoming a
cascade _ at least 10 more planets have been found just in the last
six months _ and almost as quickly scientists are perfecting
innovative new methods to expand the search. Some of these are
already starting to bear fruit.
</P>
<P>
   And the thrill of the chase is building. More and more
astronomers are joining in, with the expectation that before long
the newfound planets could include the first Earth-sized planet.
That would bring humanity closer to the ultimate goal of this
planetary quest, which is to find signs of life, and ultimately of
intelligent life, on other worlds like our own.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the golden era of planet detection, that's for sure,''
said Alan Boss, a theorist who studies planet formation at the
Carnegie Institution in Washington. ``This is the first time in
thousands of years of human exploration that we're finally seeing
these things. . . This is the ultimate big-picture story.''
</P>
<P>
   Extrasolar planets, whose existence astronomers only dreamed of
proving just a few years ago, are becoming almost commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the discoveries so far have been made by one method:
analyzing a star's light for evidence of back-and-forth motions _
its ``radial velocity'' _ that a nearby planet's pull would cause.
But several other methods have produced evidence, or at least
hints, of additional planets. Over the next few years, these
strategies may provide far more details about the already known
planets and may reveal to earthly eyes a far greater variety of
distant worlds.
</P>
<P>
   William Cochran, an astronomer at the University of Texas and an
old hand at planet-hunting _ he's been doing it for all of 12 years
_ said the field has really taken off. ``Five years ago, you could
have put all the people who were actively doing it in a small
closet. Now, there are dozens of teams working on it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Very quickly after the first extrasolar planet was reported in
October 1995 by Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz of the University of
Geneva Observatory in Switzerland, Cochran said, ``a lot of people
decided to dive right in.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate goal
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New search methods yet to come, including big-money projects
under design by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,
could lead to the ultimate find: a solar system like our own, with
at least one planet similar enough to Earth to have the potential
to harbor life.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers hope within a year or two to learn what a
``typical'' solar system looks like. That would come from a kind of
census of stars in our galaxy that could finally answer basic
questions, some of which have been debated since the days of
Aristotle and Epicurus: Are there other worlds like ours, and if
so, how many? What fraction of stars have planets of some kind?
What sizes of planets, and at what distances from their stars, seem
most common? What kinds of planets are they _ small, rocky worlds
like Earth, or gaseous giants like Jupiter, or something else
altogether?
</P>
<P>
   With more than a score of planets either confirmed or considered
likely, astronomers are already speculating about the statistics of
what they have found. ``For the first time we have enough
extrasolar planets out there to do some comparative study'' and to
``consider how our solar system compares with other planetary
systems,'' said Geoffrey Marcy of San Francisco State University,
the dean of the planet finders, at a meeting of the American
Astronomical Society this month.
</P>
<P>
   Marcy, who with astronomer Paul Butler and others has found or
confirmed most of the known extrasolar planets, said all the ones
discovered by the radial velocity method his team uses may well be
single-planet systems unlikely to harbor life. The good news, he
said, is that such systems account for only about 5 percent of the
sun-like stars being studied. The other 95 percent could prove to
have solar system-like families of planets _ places where life
might indeed have arisen.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the planetary systems found so far, Marcy
explained, is that the planets are all either extremely close to
their star _ much more so than theorists once thought possible _ or
else they follow extremely eccentric, elliptical orbits.
</P>
<P>
   Those that are very close to their stars _ much closer than
Mercury, the innermost of the solar system's planets, is to our sun
_ could not have formed where they are. They must have migrated
inward early in the formation of those solar systems, theorists
say. That migration would have disrupted any other planets in the
system or prevented them from forming. Similarly, the large planets
in eccentric orbits would so disrupt the disk of dust and gas from
which planets form that no other planets could have formed in those
systems either _ or, if they did, they would have been ejected from
the system or pulled into the star by the eccentric planet's
gravitational tugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does represent a bit of a wet blanket on the search for
intelligence in the galaxy,'' Marcy said. ``The big bullies may
wipe clean the terrestrial planets in those planetary systems,
rendering them void of any Earth analogs.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Failed solar systems
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Debra Fischer, a colleague of Marcy's at San Francisco State who
reported two more planet discoveries this month, said she thinks of
``these giant-planet systems as failed solar systems.''
</P>
<P>
   But once astronomers exclude such barren one-planet systems from
the roughly 300 that have been closely monitored, there are still
hundreds where solar systems like our sun's might yet be detected.
Since the most disruptive kind of planets are probably the easiest
to detect, ``It's those stars that constitute our non-detections,
ironically, that are most capable of having Earth-like planets,''
Marcy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're learning is that 95 percent of sun-like stars don't
have these wildly wacky Jupiters in such close-in orbits, and
that's quite good news for the SETI efforts,'' he said, referring
to astronomers listening for alien radio signals in a Search for
ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   At least one method is already capable of finding planets as
small as Earth, and scientists have high hopes that will pay off
within months. At least two other methods now on the drawing
boards, which rely on orbiting telescopes, could discover
Earth-sized planets and even learn important details about them _
perhaps even detecting signs of life.
</P>
<P>
   The first time somebody does find a solar system that resembles
our own, or a planet something like ours, that will be an epochal
event in human history, astronomers agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very hopeful sign that we've been able to find so many
of these rather strange systems,'' said planetary theorist Boss.
``It gives us hope that as we refine our methods so we can find
more normal systems, we're going to start finding them. . ..
</P>
<P>
   ``If this leads to the discovery of life beyond Earth, that
would be the ultimate.''

HOW DOES TUNNEL RADIO WORK? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Why is it that we can hear FM radio when going through a
tunnel, but we can't hear AM radio?
</P>
<P>
   L.R., Duxbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. In short, says Mark Manuelian, engineering manager at WBZ
radio in Boston, it's because AM radio waves are too big. They
don't fit into tunnels. FM waves do.
</P>
<P>
   Manuelian says a simple way to envision this phenomenon is by
the example of the pipe organ. The fat pipes that make low notes
create a wide wiggling acoustic wave for _ say, low C. But imagine
that as that big fat low C wave comes out the top of the pipe,
instead of spilling out into the church or concert hall, it tries
to travel up into a tiny little pipe right above it fitted for high
C. The `fat' wave won't fit into it. It weakens and dies.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, acoustic wave physics are much more complex than
that. But if you think of an AM radio wave as too wide to fit into
the opening of a tunnel, you've got the basic idea.
</P>
<P>
   The size of a radio wave, its wavelength, is measured from wave
peak to wave peak. AM radio waves average 1,000 feet. The average
FM wavelength is only 10 feet. (Frequency is a measure of how many
cycles pass by a given spot in one second.)
</P>
<P>
   FM has trouble with tunnels too. Even though they can fit into
the opening of the tunnel, the FM waves bounce off the walls and
vehicles in the tunnel, and each bounce robs them of some of their
energy. That's why FM fades the deeper into the tunnel you get.
</P>
<P>
   The size of AM and FM waves explains some other differences you
may have noticed. FM is stronger inside buildings with steel
frames, because those little ten-foot waves can fit between the
steel beams. AM waves are too big. Parts of them can make it
through, but they're badly attenuated . . . weakened.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why does where I stand in my room affect my FM reception?
</P>
<P>
   M.L., Boston
</P>
<P>
   A. This phenomenon is called multipath. After a radio signal
leaves the transmitter, it starts hitting metal everywhere and
bouncing around. Your radio is actually receiving the signal from
lots of directions.
</P>
<P>
   The signal has no trouble passing through non-conducting
materials like wood and glass. But the human body, made of so much
salty water, is a good conductor. As you move around in the room,
you interfere with some of the multiple signals coming in from
outside.
</P>
<P>
   But you only deflect a signal that's the right size: FM. From
peak to trough, half a cycle, an average FM wave is only five feet.
A person five feet tall is enough to interfere with a wave that
size. But we don't make much of a dent in a 1,000-foot AM wave,
most of which still gets to the radio.

CELLUCCI PLAN WOULD TURN UP HEAT ON WELFARE RECIPIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Governor Paul Cellucci intends to toughen
Massachusetts' already-stringent welfare laws with another round of
dramatic changes to move recipients with young children off the
rolls even faster than current laws mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Under a plan expected to be announced this week as part of his
budget proposal, about 11,000 recipients now subject to a two-year
cap on benefits would be required to immediately seek work or be
cut off from welfare. The plan also proposes increasing the number
of hours all other transitional beneficiaries must work, according
to administration officials working on the plan.
</P>
<P>
   To address the child-care crunch many parents face in moving
from welfare to work, Cellucci is offering an additional $55.6
million in his budget _ scheduled to be filed Wednesday _ to pay
for baby-sitting needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't find a paying job, we'll put you into a
community-service slot,'' one welfare official said. ``No matter
what, you're going to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   The new proposal is certain to renew the debate over whether the
Republican administration is being too tough on the jobless,
particularly single mothers who cannot afford or find child care.
But advocates of welfare overhaul say that the state's efforts to
move large numbers of people from the rolls into productive jobs
have largely been a success and that tougher regulation would
further the trend.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Welfare Reform Act became law in February 1995, the
number of families receiving benefits has dropped from 102,993 to
58,961, with the ranks decreasing for 64 straight months. Likewise,
state Aid to Families with Dependent Children has plummeted from
$759 million to $402 million over the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, one of the key provisions of the Welfare Reform Act
took effect, forcing nearly 5,000 cases off the welfare rolls under
a two-year benefits cap.
</P>
<P>
   That change affected nearly 25 percent of the state's caseload
of able-bodied parents with children ages 2 to 5 who are limited to
two years' benefits within any 60-month period.
</P>
<P>
   The new round of changes to be proposed by Cellucci would not
abolish that two-year cap, but would require recipients to
immediately begin looking for employment and allow them to collect
benefits while working.
</P>
<P>
   If Cellucci's plan is adopted by the Legislature, parents with
children ages 2 to 5 _ about 11,000 cases _ would be required to
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're able-bodied, your checks are going to stop'' after
two years, the source said. ``If we can get them into the workforce
prior to the 24-month cutoff, it will make it easier for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is the only state in the country that exempts
parents from having to work if the youngest child is under 5. Most
states exempt parents with children under 2.
</P>
<P>
   Among the administration's other proposed changes:
</P>
<P>
   --Able-bodied, single parents whose youngest child is over 2
would have to work an additional 10 hours per week, or 30 hours in
total. The change would bring Massachusetts in line with most other
states that have work requirements of more than 20 hours per week.
However, Massachusetts is among a small group of states that do not
allow education or training to count toward the work requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Welfare officials estimate that the change would apply to about
35 percent of the caseload, or 17,305 families.
</P>
<P>
   --Families with two able-bodied parents, with children age 2 or
older, would have to work a total of 35 hours per week. In essence,
they would have to work more hours than single parents.
</P>
<P>
   --Those who sign up for welfare would have to enroll in a
state-monitored job search within 60 days in order to receive
benefits. The state approves nearly 3,000 welfare applications each
month and about one-third of those enrollees would be subject to
the new requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's budget plan is expected to include an additional $10
million to pay for this part of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Participants would have to take part in 20 hours of job-search
activity a week.
</P>
<P>
   If the recipient does not find work, the state would issue a
warning. After 70 days, and a final warning, benefits would be cut.
</P>
<P>
   --An additional $55.6 million will be included in the
administration's budget proposal for child care to help current and
former welfare recipients. Of that, $33 million would cover
additional child-care needs resulting from the new regulations.
</P>
<P>
   However, welfare advocates say the problem is not so much a lack
of child-care funding as it is a lack of available slots,
particularly for those working weekends or second shift.
</P>
<P>
   For those who have difficulty finding child care, the proposal
allows parents to ask for a reprieve, just as they currently may do
under the 24-month benefits limit.
</P>
<P>
   Similar exemptions would be granted for those who cannot find
work despite a sincere effort to secure a job. But the state could
still push these recipients into community-service work.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the typical welfare family of a mother and two
children receives $565 a month in Aid to Families with Dependent
Children, according to the Department of Transitional Assistance.
Based on a 40-hour work week, that averages to $3.26 per hour.

   Everybody knows them. Or feels as if they do. They seem so
approachable _ so regular. Guys you'd love to have a couple of
beers with at the local tavern on a Sunday afternoon. Or trade
jokes with while shooting a game of pool or flipping burgers on a
neighbor's backyard grill.
</P>
<P>
   People in New England know the sound of their voices, which over
the years have become as familiar as those of Chet and Nat. Their
brotherly teasing is as endemic to our culture as the Saturday
morning good-natured PBS exchanges of ``Click and Clack.'' And
their salt and pepper, slicked-back hair and natty wardrobes are as
much a trademark as the all-white everything at the bridal shop
Yolanda's of Waltham.
</P>
<P>
   It's all so familiar because Eliot and Barry Tatelman of
Jordan's Furniture have been beaming their images into our homes
for a quarter century. Talking to us on the radio. Building vast
sales palaces in the suburbs where they hold court daily _ meeting,
greeting, and telling customers through lifesize puppets how much
fun it can be to shop for furniture in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   If you shop at Jordan's, they say. And if you let Barry and
Eliot, or more specifically their employees who make up what they
call the J-Team, be your guides. In other words, they suggest,
relax. Have fun. Be happy.
</P>
<P>
   Take the high-speed thrill ride called MOM (for Motion Odyssey
Movie) at the Avon store. Stroll down ``Bourbon Street during Mardi
Gras'' at the Jatick store. Warm yourself with a free cup of coffee
and a slice of cake on a cold winter's morning. Listen to the
roosters crow in the barnlike showroom filled with pine furniture
or sniff the aroma of leather in the library. And at the end of the
day, have another cup of coffee and a hot dog at the pickup station
_ your reward for doing what the boys want you to do . . . buy,
BUY, BUY!
</P>
<P>
   Spend a day with Barry and Eliot, and the whys and hows of their
success become evident _ the store is a reflection of the brothers.
Individually they are congenial, clever, bright, and funny.
Together they are masters of their universe _ of detail, marketing,
design, and what they call ``out of the box,'' or unique, thinking.
They continually play off one another. Finish each other's
sentences. Fuel each other's imaginations. And rely on each other's
strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``By ourselves, we are useless,'' says Barry, 48, with a twinkle
in his eye. ``Together we get the job done. We think alike. When he
says something that is completely off the wall, it's exactly what
I've been thinking. And we agree on almost everything. It's always
been that way.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They don't fight, basically because the lines of command have
been clearly drawn. Big brother Eliot, 52, has the"last word. He's
the detail man. He oversees all administrative and operational
functions, and specializes in doing thines differently.
</P>
<P>
   Barry, a graduate of Boston University's College of
Communication, concentrates his skills on marketing and public
relations, or what he calls ``the fun part.'' Unlike his brother,
Barry does not have to know everything that's going on. He readily
admits he'd ``screw everything up royally if I was running the
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Together, they have been wildly successful. A few statistics: In
the past two decades, Jordan's has grown from 15 to 1,300
employees. While other stores, on average, sell off their stock one
to two times a year, Jordan's turns its inventory over 13 times a
year. Most stores are heavy on promotion and sales. Jordan's never
discounts its merchandise. Other furniture stores bring in on
average $150 per square foot of showroom area. Jordan's averages
$900 per foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put the right system in place, carry the right furniture, and
hire the right people, and that brings success,'' says Eliot.
``Also, do something to attract people's attention. Everyone
thought we were nuts when we put in the MOM ride. But it's been a
winning situation for everyone. The store wins. The public wins.
And the community wins because we give the profits from the ride to
charity,'' so far over $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers credit their father with teaching them how to run
their business and how to keep balance in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our father was a man without enemies and (with) very high
scruples. He was honest and upright and always put family before
business,'' says Eliot. ``When we were kids, there were three
generations working in the Waltham store. We used to all go out to
lunch together, which was fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel, their grandfather, launched the family into the
furniture business when he opened a store with his brother-in-law
in Waltham in(the late 1920s. It was called Gray's Furniture.
Eventually the two partners split up, and Samuel opened his own
store and called it Jordan's. No one knows exactly where the name
came from, but Barry remembers his father saying something about
Samuel picking it out of a hat.
</P>
<P>
   After Barry and Eliot took over the business in 1973, they began
to search for new ways to advertise their stoRe. Barry says it was
their older brother, Milton, ``who invented us. He was a copywriter
in New York and heard these two guys talking back and forth on the
radio in an ad campaign for, I think, Barney's. He thought we
should try something similar. I was game because I'd been a drama
major in school, but I didn't know about Eliot. But he was game,
and the three of us spent a lot of time coming up with fun
scripts.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked on radio. Then came television. Again there was
skepticism about whether the ads would translate to the medium.
Plus, Barry and Eliot were concerned that if they became public
figures they might jeopardize their privacy. The witty ads remain
popular, and yet the brothers have retained their privacy.
Unfortunately, both their parents died before seeing their sons'
success. Their brother died of AIDS five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the company more or less running itself, with a nkd to
their management team, as Barry and Eliot put it, they spend a good
deal of time these days on charity and community work. On a recent
blustery morning, Eliot, dressed in his proverbial black _ black
shoes, socks, suit, shirt, and muted black-and-blue printed tie _
arrived promptly at 8 a.m. at Dean College in Franklin where he and
Barry were scheduled to talk to 500 high school seniors. Barry
arrived 15 minutes later with his bollege freshman son in tow. He,
too, was dressed in black shoes, black pants, and a black-and-gray
striped shirt, but he broke the somberness with a brown sport coat
and tie ablaze with images from ``The Simpsons,'' one of his
favosite television shows.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers were scheduled to give a motivational talk,
something they do at least once a week, on how work can be fun aod
the many paths to career success.
</P>
<P>
   They banter back and forth, just as they do in their ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about thinking out of the box,'' says Eliot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing the unusual. Let's say there are four gas stations on
four corners at an intersection,'' says Barry. ``One of the
stations knows his customers by name. He also knows who reads the
sports pages and gives them a free copy of the sports section. He
also gives out free coffee and homemade cookies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now which station would you go to?,'' asks Eliot. ``Of course
you'd pick the one with the cookies and coffee. This is the kind of
thinking we try to do at Jordan's.
</P>
<P>
   ``People get too much into routines. More people need to work on
breakijg the mold. Thinking in different ways _ which isn't always
easy.''
</P>
<P>
   At 11, the brothers head to the Natick store where they meet
with representatives from the Massachusetts Adoption Resource
Exchange. Jordan's is hosting a party early next month for children
and prospective adoptive parents.
</P>
<P>
   Eliot is all business. He wants the specifics. How many people
will come? How many kids? What would be considered a success?
</P>
<P>
   Barry, as usual, is interested in the entertainment, the food
and games. ``We're basically showmen,'' he says, ``so you have to
hold us back. This kind of thing is what we do best.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>

   Barry's sense of fun, love of cartoon characters, pop culture,
and the theater is evident in his office in the Avon store. There's
a ``Simpsons'' chess set on his desk, cardboard cutouts of the
Beatles, pictures of Dick Van Dyke and members of the ``Mary Tyler
Moore Show'' (another of his favorites). Then there is the family
wall devoted to pictures of his wife, son, daughter, and dog. In
the middle is a photo of his dream house _ the Vineyard home he and
his wife built two years ago and where he spends the summer months
indulging his addiction, golf.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Eliot's office is all business. The only bit of
whimsy and color is his collection of kaleidoscopes and a toy
motorcyle. Both brothers own cycles _ Eliot a Harley, Barry a
Honda. Eliot, like his brother, has a second home, but his is on
Lake Winnipesaukee, N.H. His wife is a schoolteacher, his two
children are the same age as Eliot's kids, and they, too, have a
dog.
</P>
<P>
   So if the suburban empire is to continue expanding, where will
they open their next store?
</P>
<P>
   ``On the North Shore, but I'm not telling the location,'' says
Eliot. ``What I will tell you is that it will be twice as big as
the Natick store.'' That would tally up to 400,000 square feet of
showroom space. And the fun continues.

ARE THEY HELPING OR HOARDING? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At what point do many cats become too many cats?
</P>
<P>
   News reports about exonerated murder suspect Edmund F. Burke
have made much of the fact that he kept 30-odd cats in his home,
including four dead cats in his refrigerator. (Burke's lawyer
explained that his client was waiting for the ground to thaw so he
could bury them.) The cats, alive and dead, were seen by many as
prima facie evidence that Burke is dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Bishop thinks it's unfortunate that the Burke case linked
multiple cat ownership with violence. ``Some people may think it's
eccentric,'' she said. ``But it doesn't indicate a violent person.
Usually just the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop runs the Alliance for Animals in Arlington, Mass., a
no-kill shelter with a low-cost spay and neuter clinic and a cat
adoption center. She explained the difference between cat rescuers
and cat hoarders.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers are people who shelter cats in their homes, spay or
neuter them, take good care of them, and try to adopt them out. Cat
hoarders are another story.
</P>
<P>
   ``They take in animals because they can't bear to see them
suffer,'' Bishop said, ``but then they can't take care of the
animals. The animals are breeding in the home, they're suffering,
they're dying, and the person can't see it. They honestly think
they're saving the animals. They tend to be suspicious, they don't
trust anybody. So they think that even if the animals die in their
house, they're better off than they would be in a shelter.''
</P>
<P>
   Animal hoarding is a serious issue for humane societies. Dr.
Gary Patronek, director of the Center for Animals and Public Policy
at Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine, is conducting a
study of the phenomenon. `Hoarding behavior of any kind is not well
understood,'' Patronek said, ``and when it involves living
creatures it adds a whole other dimension.''
</P>
<P>
   Patronek said animal hoarding appears to be a mental health
problem, but exactly what kind is unclear. ``There are indications
that it may involve obsessive-compulsive disorder, brain disorders,
brain deterioration,'' he said. ``It seems to be a final common
pathway for a variety of disorders.''
</P>
<P>
   Animal hoarding is often dismissed as a lifestyle choice,
Patronek said. The problem is bounced from one agency to another _
from public health to law enforcement to mental health to humane
societies. He hopes the study will help shed light on the problem
and lead to finding better ways to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   Patronek's initial findings appear in the January issue of the
journal Public Health Reports. In his article, ``Hoarding Animals:
An Undermanaged Public Health Problem in a Difficult-to-Study
Population,'' he lists five indicators of pathological animal
hoarding behavior. (Three-quarters of the cases he studied involved
women, hence the choice of pronoun.)
</P>
<P>
   --She accumulates a large number of animals.
</P>
<P>
   --She fails to provide minimal standards of nutrition,
sanitation, and veterinary care.
</P>
<P>
   --She fails to act on the deteriorating conditions of the
animals.
</P>
<P>
   --She fails to act on the deteriorating environment. ``We're
talking about a foot of feces on the floor in some of these
cases,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   --She doesn't respond to the negative effects the environment
may be having on her own well-being and that of family members and
others.
</P>
<P>
   Patronek emphasized that keeping multiple cats or other animals
is not necessarily an indication of mental instability. ``I would
never say that. There are countless examples of people who have
large numbers of animals and take care of them perfectly,'' he
said.

AS PHONE RATES DROP, SOME GO WIRELESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL AND PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As cell phone rates plummet as low as 10 cents a minute for
calls made any time and anywhere in the country, it's easy to
believe a marketing slogan from AT &AMP; T Wireless: Your wireless
phone could be your only phone.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, these one-rate national plans offered by all of the
wireless firms in Boston are attractive. You buy a huge bucket of
minutes, from several hundred to 1,500, for calls made any time to
any state, with no long-distance or extra charges.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't come here yet, but consider this little-publicized
experiment outside Dallas. AT &AMP; T Wireless is offering unlimited
local calls for $40 a month. Long-distance calls are only a dime a
minute.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Cerniglia, 46, doesn't need any convincing about the
benefits of a full-time cellular life. The advertising salesman
uses his cell phone for all business and personal calls, and is
considering snipping his home-based wired line.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wireless phone is my exclusive phone,'' he said through his
cell phone. ``Everybody calls me on this phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Called ``cutting the cord'' by industry analysts, this
mini-trend finds people abandoning their home wired line for the
cellular phone. It's a phenomenon led largely by single people on
the go, such as college students, and business people who travel a
lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people were finding that their home phone was becoming
a receptacle for voice mail messages,'' said Karin Olson,
spokeswoman for Omnipoint.
</P>
<P>
   Even if people keep their home-based phone, some like these
one-rate national cellular plans as a second line and place many
long-distance calls from them.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Goldberg, editor of Wireless Dimension.com, said relying on
a wireless phone still doesn't make sense for most adults who
remain centered at a home location and make many local calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't hear about a lot of families with two kids doing
this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   First, remember that only one phone number can be assigned to
each wireless handset. There's no such thing as extensions of the
same number. Imagine answering a phone call for a teenager who is
upstairs in a bedroom. Do you really want to throw the handset up a
flight of stairs?
</P>
<P>
   Also, keep in mind that wireless phone users pay for all calls
received, and initiated, by the handset. In Europe and much of the
rest of the world, cellular users generally pay for only calls they
make, but there's two-way charging in this country and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 minutes may seem impossible to use up, but not
if you're docked for all incoming calls.
</P>
<P>
   And you may be surprised how many local minutes you rack up in a
month. Industry estimates show that the average adult makes about
450 minutes in local calls a month. But that's only calls
initiated, not received. If you consider a home with two adults who
get as many calls as they make, that household would use up about
1,800 minutes in local calls alone.
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, consumers pay less by staying with their
local carrier, such as Bell Atlantic, where calling plans put local
calls in the range of several pennies a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Lowenstein, senior vice president of the Yankee Group, a
Boston telecommunications research group, said consumers choosing a
wireless phone life should also remember that voice quality can be
erratic with some cellular carriers, and battery life, at best, is
about four hours.
</P>
<P>
   When choosing a cellular company, consider that they don't all
have the same geographic reach. Some one-rate plans also require
that your calls originate from the East Coast or some metropolitan
centers.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic Mobile has a special 500-minute plan for $59.99.
The calls must be initiated within the East Coast region, but can
go out to anywhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side for total-cellular users, the price of their
one-rate plans automatically includes extra services, such as
call-waiting, voice mail, and caller ID. These plans have no
``roaming'' charges. Under other wireless plans, customers pay such
roaming charges, which are applied when they move outside their
carrier's home network and borrow services from another carrier.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're a Sprint PCS customer who finds the allotment of
minutes offered more than you can use, you can share the minutes
with another customer for an extra $15 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The pros and cons of the cut-the-cord lifestyle were obvious
during our conversation last week with a cellular user.
</P>
<P>
   We heard that John Carozza, an actor, was about to cut his
home-based wired line in favor of his Sprint PCS cell phone. When
we called his cell phone, we reached him with perfect reception.
And he was in Los Angeles on business. He was on his way to Utah,
but said we could still reach him. Just call the same phone number.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm within reach everywhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It sounded so wonderful, but less so when we realized that he,
too, had to pay for the 10-minute call we placed.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The month of deposits
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's that time of year when many people put down hefty deposits
for summer rentals, youth camp programs, and nursery and private
school tuitions. It's good to keep in mind a few things before you
hand over the money.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most important is to make the deposit with a credit
card, if possible. Under federal regulations regarding credit card
use, you may have some leverage if you end up dissatisfied and want
money back.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that real estate agencies, schools and most
businesses can set any policy they want regarding the deposit
amount, cancellation fees, and refund rules as long as they
disclose the policy to you in advance, said Diane Szafarowicz,
assistant attorney general in the consumer protection division.
There's also nothing stopping them from asking for a full up-front
payment.
</P>
<P>
   (Exceptions are auto dealers and home-improvement contractors
who must follow industry-specific state laws on deposits.)
</P>
<P>
   If you cancel your plans and want your money back, Szafarowicz
said, state common law says the amount they keep must be
``reasonable in relation to the injury suffered.'' But if the
business disclosed the rules and you signed the contract, you may
have a hard time proving your case.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Szafarowicz said, consumers should remember to use a
credit card if they can, put down as little as possible, and read
the contract carefully.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Gas gouging
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Pakstis, a psychologist, found that today's gas prices _
often under $1 a gallon _ don't apply at the rental car agency
pump. In a rush, he failed to fill the gas tank when he returned
his Hertz rental in Baltimore. He was charged $3.70 a gallon for 10
gallons. The $37 charge was nearly the cost of his two-day rental.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there any regulation on what they can charge for gas?'' he
asked us in a recent e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently not. The attorney general's office said the agency
can set its own gas price if it discloses it in writing in the
contract (which Hertz did in small print) and the amount is not
``unconscionably'' high.
</P>
<P>
   While $3.70 a gallon is exorbitant, the attorney general's
office staff said it would be hard to prove it was
``unconscionably'' high given that it is not the rental agency's
job to fill tanks with gas.
</P>
<P>
   Pakstis said he was offered the Hertz pre-paid plan, in which
customers pay Hertz in advance to refuel the car. If he had
purchased this plan, Pakstis would have paid $1.10 a gallon, or
about $11 for a full tank.
</P>
<P>
   The Andover, Mass. man said he has bought this pre-paid plan
before, but found himself driving around to use up gas. After all,
he had already paid for a full re-fueling and didn't think the
rental agency should get the extra money.

2 CLERGYMEN LET THE MYSTERY BE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN MCNAMARA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Protestant pastor and a Catholic bishop agree. In the
not-so-distant past, that alone would have been something of a
miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Finding themselves in a similar fix last week _ asked to declare
wondrous doings within their flocks ``miraculous'' _ the pastor of
the Episcopal Church of the Good Shepherd in Wareham, Mass. and the
bishop of Worcester, Mass. wisely demurred. Both settled for
``mysterious,'' instead.
</P>
<P>
   Humility could be experiencing a religious revival.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 14 months, a panel appointed by Bishop Daniel P.
Reilly has investigated claims that Audrey Marie Santo, mute and
paralyzed since her near drowning in the family's swimming pool in
1987, is a miracle worker.
</P>
<P>
   The faithful testified that in the presence of the 15-year-old
girl, oil oozes from religious statues, Communion wafers
spontaneously stain with blood, paintings of saints shed tears, the
sick recover. Her modest home has become a shrine, its garage a
chapel where Mass is offered for the hundreds who make the
pilgrimage in search of divine intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Who is to say they don't find it?
</P>
<P>
   Not Reilly, whose preliminary investigation found no evidence of
chicanery. No bottle of virgin olive oil was concealed within the
plaster likeness of the Madonna; no family member's blood type
matched the blood on the hosts; no scheme was uncovered to exploit
their child for financial gain.
</P>
<P>
   Although the probe will continue with analysis of the oil and
blood, examinations of Audrey, and a review of the medical records
of those who claim sudden cures, surely the church knows the most
it can do is eliminate suspicion of fraud. The human mind is no
more able to ``prove'' the occurrence of a miracle than it is the
existence of God.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of faith is a willingness to suspend doubt. The Rev.
Cuthbert Mandell acknowledged as much last week after a work
session in his Wareham church turned into a spiritual experience
for parishioners staining a closet door. When the fruitwood stain
dried, the image of Jesus appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Is it Jesus? Mandell says that depends on the viewer. That's not
an equivocation. No one today knows what Jesus actually looked
like, after all. Images from the third century present a
clean-shaven, athletic youth. The more Semitic likeness we now
associate with Jesus _ the long flowing hair and beard, a prominent
nose _ came from the imaginations of later artists.
</P>
<P>
   Who is to say that the image is or is not the face of Jesus? The
closet door is not the Shroud of Turin. There is no question of
clever forgery, only a subjective interpretation of whorls of wood.
</P>
<P>
   Mandell has placed a simple box in front of the image to allow
visitors to meditate. He wants to avoid the circus atmosphere that
prevailed last summer during Mass at a football stadium where
Audrey Marie Santo appeared at midfield in an air-conditioned
plexiglass box. The Bishop of Worcester has asked that such a
``spectacle'' not be repeated. He may have no more luck than the
Bishop of Tarbes, who asked the faithful to observe the barricades
at the grotto in Lourdes, where Bernadette Soubirous saw visions of
Mary in 1858.
</P>
<P>
   Even in this cynical age, people are hungry to believe. Is there
anyone who has not had a brush with the miraculous? A single lilac
that blooms out of season on return from a loved one's funeral. A
vivid dream that provides sudden clarity. A chance encounter that
changes a life.
</P>
<P>
   Was it a miracle that Marjorie Donovan stepped out of her
tollbooth in West Stockbridge, Mass. Friday morning, one minute
before a speeding tractor-trailer demolished it? Was it divine
intervention that brought Richard Silvia to a Taunton, Mass. pond
last Sunday just as 14-year-old Kevin Vargas fell though the ice?
</P>
<P>
   The skeptic will ask why the ``miracle'' that saved Donovan did
not prevent the truck from crashing in the first place, or why the
``miracle'' that saved Vargas cost Silvia his life. Skepticism is
its own religion.
</P>
<P>
   But spiritual life is less about the answers we find than the
questions we ask. The need to explain that which defies
conventional explanation ignores the reality that all ``facts'' are
filtered through our subjective experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only two ways to live your life,'' Albert Einstein
once said. ``One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as
if everything is.'' The Protestant pastor and the Catholic bishop
are leaving the choice to us.

UNSPECIAL PROSECUTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- In the post-impeachment daze, one wonders how
all this started. What rough beast slouching toward Washington
could have wrought such a fine mess?
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel law is Frankenstein's monster,
terrorizing the village, its power supplied from the civic virtues
whose absence has been ferociously deplored, especially that
talisman of nonpolitical politics, bipartisanship.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton once embraced the concept while Republicans still
resented independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, whose lengthy
investigation of the Iran-contra arms deal had (deja vu?) cost $40
million, but produced few convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased to sign into law the reauthorization of the
Independent Counsel Act,'' Clinton said on June 30, 1994. He called
the law ``a foundation stone for the trust between the government
and our citizens. Opponents called it a partisan attack against
Republican presidents and a waste of taxpayer funds. It was
neither. In fact, the independent counsel statute has been in the
past and is today a force for government integrity and public
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Fueling this hybrid monster, whose oxygen is scheduled to run
out in June this year, is highly combustible material, presidential
promises rigorously kept. In 1968, when he ran for president,
Richard Nixon won applause when he said he would ``appoint a new
attorney general.'' He appointed four, but the first two, John
Mitchell and Richard Kleindienst, were convicted on charges related
to Watergate, the scandal that produced the first special
prosecutor, Archibald Cox.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter, who promised a government as good as the American
people, delivered a massive ethics-in-government act that was
high-minded, inconsistent, and unmanageable. Congress, trying to be
as pure and pious as the president, passed it in 1978. The law
ensnared alleged rascals in Carter's entourage whose mild misdeeds
special prosecutors could not prove.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Ronald Reagan's administration opposed renewing the
law. The associate attorney general, Rudolph Giuliani, argued that
it was unconstitutional because it violated the separation of
powers concept by involving federal judges in law enforcement. But
the House renewed the law by a 137-34 bipartisan majority, with
only a few rebels like Newt Gingrich and Bob Livingstone in
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation changed the name from ``special prosecutor'' to
``independent counsel,'' but did not answer the question of
Secretary of Labor Raymond Donovan. When the prosecutor found
``insufficient credible evidence'' to indict him, Donovan asked,
``What office do I go to to get my reputation back?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, a House subcommittee defeated an attempt by
Representative George Gekas, Republican of Pennsylvania, to limit
the investigations to two years, after which the counsel would no
longer have an open-ended budget, but an annual appropriation.
Politics, cried the Democrats, then in the majority, and Gekas was
beaten down. In the full committee, Representative Henry Hyde,
Republican of Illinois, sought to punish investigators who abused
the rules of evidence and leaked material. Democrats defeated him
on a party-line vote, 21-14.
</P>
<P>
   With enough oxen gored, now is the time for Congress to reassume
its oversight duty. Did the secretary of agriculture take tickets
to a ballgame from almond growers? Then expose him and let the
president fire him, but don't try to indict him. When Mike Espy was
acquitted, the jury raised a standard to which the wise and honest
could repair.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, many miners and ranchers think Secretary of
Interior Bruce Babbitt is a tree-huggin' fool. None think he is a
crook, yet an independent counsel breathes upon his innocent neck.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has postured and passed the buck to special prosecutors
(20 of them so far), ducking its duty for 25 years in a pageant of
mutually destructive bipartisanship. The independent counsel law
belongs on the scrapheap of history.

UNMISTAKABLY DELILLO

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ ``Everything is the interview,'' a character
says in Don DeLillo's play ``Valparaiso,'' which begins a world
premiere engagement this Friday at the American Repertory Theatre's
Loeb Drama Center.
</P>
<P>
   Those four words could provide ``Valparaiso'' with its motto.
The play's two acts comprise an endless series of interviews given
by its hero, Michael Majeski (played by Will Patton), as he finds
himself subjected to a particularly inexplicable 15 minutes of fame
after a business trip that was supposed to go to Valparaiso, Ind.,
instead takes him to Valparaiso, Chile.
</P>
<P>
   A more appropriate motto for the play's author might be
``Everything isn't the interview.'' Talking to the press has been
almost as alien an experience for DeLillo, the author of 11 novels,
as writing for the stage has been. ``It seems I do a play every
decade,'' he jokes. His first, ``The Engineer of Moonlight''
(1979), has never been produced. His second, ``The Day Room,''
received its world premiere at ART in 1986.

<P>
   To promote the ART's staging, DeLillo has consented to a limited
number of interviews. ``I'm trying to develop a spirit of
cooperation,'' he says _ not altogether in jest. It's a job he's
willing to do, but that it is a job there can be little doubt.
Talking to a reporter, DeLillo frequently purses his lips and
stares off into space, visibly considering his response. In an era
where Oprah is queen and Larry King, interview subjects tend to
proceed on automatic pilot (a tendency exploited to fiendish effect
in ``Valparaiso''). DeLillo, 62, who happily admits to having never
done a television interview, keeps his hands on the controls. There
are long pauses before he answers _ sometimes long pauses during
his answers _ then the words come in a rush.
</P>
<P>
   He's wearing jeans, flannel shirt, and hiking boots. All that
sets him apart from anyone else who might have just come in from
the Harvard Square cold _ or that could suggest this polite man
sitting in a small room overlooking Brattle Street might be the
author of such darkling, phosphorescent novels as ``Underworld''
(1998), ``Libra'' (1988), and ``White Noise'' (1985) _ are his
intense air and epic deadpan. In person, as in print, DeLillo can
be very funny, but one would never know it by his expression. The
name most often associated with DeLillo on the page is Thomas
Pynchon, his fellow master of the paranoid style in American
fiction. With DeLillo on the stage, it could be Pirandello, the
theater's supreme surrealist. For DeLillo in person, Buster Keaton
would be a worthy candidate.
</P>
<P>
   DeLillo's novels are populated by visionary rationalists and
buttoned-down madmen, assassins and waste specialists, suicidal
rock stars and militaristic football players. No other living
writer in English can lend such torque to a simple declarative
sentence. ``The moment does not whisper the usual things,'' Michael
tells one of his interviewers, in an unmistakably DeLillo
statement. Menace and meaning (paranoia's yin and yang) do battle
in his books, and technology simultaneously obsesses, horrifies,
and beckons him. An interviewer in ``Valparaiso'' describes flying
as ``That sort of underbreath of powerful thrilling systems,'' and
that, too, is unmistakably DeLillo.
</P>
<P>
   DeLillo began work on what is now ``Valparaiso'' in 1991.
Dissatisfied with the results, he soon abandoned it for what would
turn out to be ``Underworld.'' The novel took five years to write,
and when he was done DeLillo found himself looking at what he'd
done on the play. ``It seemed, if anything, even more fragmentary
and unpromising,'' he recalls. ``But I saw something in it.'' He
went to work and had a finished version within five months.
</P>
<P>
   Losing control
</P>
<P>
   The theater has long attracted novelists _ and usually left them
with little to show for it. The most infamous example is Henry
James and the debacle of ``Guy Domville.'' Among contemporaries,
one could cite Saul Bellow (``The Last Analysis''), E. L. Doctorow
(``Drinks before Dinner''), and John Updike (``Buchanan Dying''),
none of whom carved out a second career treading the boards.
</P>
<P>
   The complete control a novelist enjoys over his creation bears
little relation to what a playwright experiences. It may be his or
her play, but it's the director's, the set designer's, the actors'
production. It's the curse of collaboration: Even if the text
remains untouched down to the last comma, a playwright's
contribution is the necessary, but far from sufficient, condition
for a production's success.
</P>
<P>
   For DeLillo, the collaborative nature of the theater is very
much a part of what draws him to write for the stage. He's sat in
on several rehearsals to take questions from the cast and has had
``many discussions'' with the production's director, David Wheeler.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting,'' DeLillo says.``I think it's precisely because
a novelist lives in a world of fragile autonomy that I welcome the
chance to work with other people. It's certainly not something I
would want to do exclusively, and for me there is an element in
which each form is the antidote to the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Collaboration may diminish the writer's authority, but DeLillo
is fascinated by the way it can enlarge the play itself. ``It's
very interesting to rediscover your play through the work of the
actors. You can see levels of perception and motivation in a
particular character based on the way an actor reads a single line.
This is one of the most exciting things about doing a play for me.
In effect, the play isn't really written until performances begin.
Even then, it's still seeking a kind of self-realization that it
will probably never actually accomplish. Of course, that's another
major difference between writing novels and writing plays. A play
is never quite done somehow. There's no definitive performance.''
</P>
<P>
   A media miasma
</P>
<P>
   A lack of definition is central to the experience of the
characters in ``Valparaiso.'' They move in a media miasma, at once
cheerful and terrifying, that's all formless form and contentless
content. Asked how difficult it was to burlesque something as
inherently absurd as talk television, DeLillo (a man of
otherwise-unfailing courtesy) bridles slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider this parody or satire,'' he says. ``I
consider this, really, the story of a man with a missing identity
and the means by which he seeks to pursue this identity. It happens
that he does it publicly. It's very important to remember that in
the series of interviews he does there are technological
instruments involved. This, to a certain degree, is also a play
about cameras, microphones, and audio recording equipment. This is
the taken-for-granted presence of the force of technology in our
lives _ which I try not to take for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drive in technology is always toward somethings that's
faster, better, more complete. In this play, there's a sense of
complete revelation, complete exposure, and the complete
absorption, finally, of the main character. I wonder if there is a
secret drive in technology that tends toward a kind of totalitarian
perception, something we don't glimpse necessarily. Or whether
there's something in us that's brought to realization by technology
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think of this as a play about the media. I think of it
as a play about the culture and a particular man who tries to find
his self-realization in the public arena. A thousand years ago a
man may have wandered into the desert (in our romantic imaginings)
and tried to lose his sense of selfhood by becoming a monk in a
monastery in some remote region and to try to find a certain
transcendence. Here, in this particular context, a man tries to
gain a sense of self and he does it by the most public means
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing celebrity
</P>
<P>
   The great success of ``Underworld'' _ with everything from a
six-figure movie sale to write-ups in such bibles of celebrity
culture as Vanity Fair and Elle _ saw DeLillo having his own
encounter with the public arena. To what extent might that
experience to be seen to inform his treatment of Michael Majeski's
unexpected media inundation?
</P>
<P>
   DeLillo dismisses any connection. ``The book's reception was an
amazing surprise to me,'' he says, ``but nothing in my life changed
after `Underworld' except that I got a little mail and more
requests, which are things that can be handled in a matter of
minutes. The experience did not effect the play.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he adds, ``You know, I never thought of this play in
terms of `Underworld.' But, in a way, that's about Cold War
America, and this play seems to be about the post-Cold War period
in which we now find ourselves, a period of personality, celebrity,
fame, scandal, enormous wealth, and empty spectacle. There seems to
be no difference between substantial news and insubstantial news.
And in the play everything melts into something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no distinction between public and private,'' he
explains. ``Nothing is allowed to remain unseen and nothing is
allowed to remain unsaid. There's a tendency of the characters to
think of everything as potential footage. Things exist in order to
be recorded in one manner or another.''
</P>
<P>
   As a character in the play says, ``Off-camera lives are
unverifiable.'' Those words are at once a statement of media fact
and a presumed source of solace to DeLillo as he gets ready to
return to writing fiction. Deadpan or no, there's the faintest hint
of a smile when says, ``I think at the end of this experience I
will probably look forward to being alone in a room again with a
piece of paper.''

BRITAIN GOES STONE COLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ As British rock icons go, Mick Jagger, the pouting,
ageless Rolling Stones singer, may be the biggest.
</P>
<P>
   But a funny thing happened here last week when Jagger's American
wife, supermodel Jerry Hall, announced her intention to divorce him
for his serial adultery. Jagger responded by saying their exotic
1990 wedding on Bali was a fake, so she wasn't entitled to any
alimony.
</P>
<P>
   Most Brits lined up squarely behind Hall, declaring that
Jagger's bad-boy image belonged on stage, not at home. What began
as a messy celebrity divorce is becoming something of a cultural
sea change, as many Britons reconsider their views of one of the
most famous and richest of their countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   Jagger rhymes with swagger, and he embodied it in the 1960s and
1970s, when the Stones positioned themselves as the bad-boy
alternative to the Beatles. If the Beatles were a bunch of nice
lads from provincial Liverpool, the Stones personified hip,
cosmopolitan London, more nasty than nice. That image, not to
mention some great songs, made the Stones in general and Jagger in
particular world famous.
</P>
<P>
   Like other successful rock groups who find touring too lucrative
to pass up, even as they become grandfathers, the four remaining
members of the Stones continue to put out albums and stage lavish
shows, despite having a cumulative age of 214. And while most
graying rock stars are a shadow of their former selves on stage,
the 55-year-old Jagger is still the original Jumpin' Jack Flash,
leaping around with the energy and abandon of a man half his age.
</P>
<P>
   The Rolling Stones have done more than their share to earn their
bad-boy reputation. One of the band's guitarists, Brian Jones, died
of a drug overdose. Longtime bassist Bill Wyman was widely
denounced as a pervert when he married a 17-year-old. Keith
Richards, the guitarist and Jagger's songwriting collaborator, has
battled various addictions, changing his blood to kick the heroin
habit as some people change the oil in their cars.
</P>
<P>
   Jagger, however, took care of his body like a professional
athlete. He studied at the London School of Economics, not the
London School of Music, and brought business acumen to the music
industry while peers were shooting their profits into their veins
or snorting it up their nostrils.
</P>
<P>
   But in the twilight of his career, and especially in light of
his domestic troubles, more people are beginning to see Jagger's
fastidiousness not as something to admire, but as part of a great
rock 'n' roll swindle.
</P>
<P>
   As Rodney Saunders, a skeptical music fan from Middlesex, put
it: ``I always thought Jagger was a hypocritical phony with his
music copied from black rhythm and blues and the image of
rebellious '60s icon carried on into near pensionable age. Now he's
surpassed himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever there is a dispute pitting Yanks against Brits, the
British have a tendency to side with their own, no matter what the
merits. That, in part, explains why so many Britons were so willing
to believe that former nanny Louise Woodward was wrongfully accused
of killing an American toddler.
</P>
<P>
   But Jagger's assertion that Hall, the mother of four of his
children, was not entitled to any money in a divorce because their
marriage was not legal, brought howls of indignation from
newspapers and ordinary Britons who labeled Jagger a cad.
</P>
<P>
   Many Britons believe Jagger is willing to renounce the woman he
lived with for 21 years and the children they produced simply to
protect his fortune. Hall wants $50 million, about one-fifth of
Jagger's estimated wealth, which is nearly double the highest
divorce settlement ever in Britain, paid out by Prince Charles to
Diana, Princess of Wales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mick's dismal behavior towards Jerry Hall is now a matter of
record,'' fumed The Mirror. ``Given his selfishness, it was too
much to expect him to give in quietly for the sake of his four
children, whom he has now also succeeded in humiliating.''
</P>
<P>
   While admired for his musical harmonies, Jagger has been
excoriated for his parsimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it ever cool to be despicable? Was it ever sexy to be
penny-pinching and selfish? Of course not,'' The Daily Mail
declared.
</P>
<P>
   No one questions Jagger's ability to write a song. He and
Richards are among the most prolific and successful songwriting
teams in history. Nor does anyone question Jagger's stage presence
and charisma, which more than made up for his lack of range as a
vocalist.
</P>
<P>
   But more people are coming to question why someone who appears
to have more money than he could ever spend and who seems to have
no other passion but to amass a fortune and bed as many women as he
can, continues to perform while refusing to do the right thing by
his wife and children.
</P>
<P>
   Garry Mulholland, music editor of Time Out, a London magazine,
says the Stones continue to tour because Jagger insists on it, and
Jagger insists on doing so simply to make money.
</P>
<P>
   ``This pains me to say, because I was brought up on the Stones
and adored their music, but for the last 20 years the Stones, and
especially Jagger, have become a joke,'' said Mulholland. ``Each
new album is worse and sells less. That's why they tour. They make
their money from the tour, not the albums.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulholland believes that most British people long ago concluded
that Jagger is ``a businessman, not an artist.'' Jagger's
reputation for pettiness was enhanced last year, when he threatened
to call off a tour over a tax dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the public perception of Mick Jagger is that he is a
bit of an arse, and a greedy one at that,'' said Mulholland.
</P>
<P>
   Like Americans, the British don't expect their rock stars to be
role models or pillars of the community. And the British have an
enormous capacity to forgive their wayward stars, especially if
those stars exhibit other redeeming qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Sting _ the former lead singer of The Police, who has enjoyed an
enormously successful solo career _ was similarly denounced when he
left his wife for the actress Trudie Styler. But Sting's work with
Amnesty International and charitable organizations has earned him
fans who are only remotely interested in his music.
</P>
<P>
   The homophobic British tabloids pilloried the pop singer George
Michael when he was arrested last year in a Los Angeles public
restroom after exposing himself to an undercover police officer.
Michael was forced to confirm his homosexuality. But he offered to
serve AIDS patients as a condition of his probation, and his
popularity has soared.
</P>
<P>
   Jagger, on the other hand, is being denounced as soulless,
scheming, self-absorbed jerk, someone so cheap that he is willing
to legally categorize his children as bastards if it will save him
some cash. Conspicuous by its absence is any groundswell of support
for him.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, 42, understands the way British people think. She could
sue for divorce in the United States, where she would be eligible
for nearly three times as much as she is asking for here. But she
would also be open to charges of being a gold-digger.
</P>
<P>
   Jagger's miserliness and chronic infidelity stand out all the
more when compared with the only other living British rock star
whose ability and success rivals his: Paul McCartney. Make that Sir
Paul McCartney, because unlike Jagger, who purposely spends most of
his time outside Britain to avoid paying taxes here, the former
Beatle was considered such a good citizen he was knighted.
</P>
<P>
   McCartney and his American wife, Linda, were an antidote to
celebrities who treat marriage like a hobby, something to be tried
and tossed aside as a whim. Linda McCartney was adopted by many
Britons as one of their own. The McCartneys' daughter, Stella, is
one of Britain's most successful young fashion designers.
</P>
<P>
   When Linda McCartney died last year after a long battle with
cancer, her husband's declaration of undying love moved many people
and only increased the affection for him.
</P>
<P>
   In his youth, Jagger derided the Beatles, saying they lacked the
gritty edge of the Rolling Stones. Perhaps that is true. But as far
as many Britons are concerned, Paul McCartney is a man, while Mick
Jagger needs to grow up.

WHAT BECOMES A LEGEND MOST? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Newman a screen legend? No way. Well, certainly Jack
Nicholson, or Meryl Streep? Don't think so. How about Sabu, star of
``The Elephant Boy'' and ``Cobra Woman''? You betcha.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the American Film Institute is at in again.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, all manner of dissent and discord broke out when the
AFI released its list of the 100 greatest American films. It was
hard to argue with some of the Top 10 choices, which included
``Citizen Kane,'' ``The Godfather,'' and ``The Wizard of Oz.'' But
after that, it got pretty ugly _ is ``American Graffiti'' (No. 77)
a better film than ``Goodfellas'' (No. 94)? ``Rebel Without a
Cause'' and ``Giant'' are cited, but why not ``East of Eden,''
certainly the best of James Dean's career trifecta? What back door
did ``Forrest Gump'' and ``Pulp Fiction'' slip through to make the
list?
</P>
<P>
   Now, AFI, which of late has promoted more fights than Don King,
is really cruisin' for a bruisin' with its latest publicity stunt _
the Top 50 screen legends.
</P>
<P>
   AFI has compiled a list of 250 actors and 250 actresses deemed
eligible as screen legends, and 1,800 members of the film community
must cast their ballots by Friday. But the criteria alone is reason
enough to scream. According to the AFI, a screen legend is, first
and foremost, ``an actor or a team of actors with a significant
screen presence in American feature-length films whose screen debut
occurred before 1950.'' Now that certainly allows room for the
greats of Hollywood's Golden Era _ from Greta Garbo to Clark Gable,
from Dorothy Dandridge to Humphrey Bogart, from Marilyn Monroe to
the Marx Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   But it also opens the door for lots of folks precious few people
have probably ever heard of _ quick, name a film starring King
Baggot or Edna Purviance.
</P>
<P>
   Yet you won't find Newman, Streep, or Nicholson on the list, nor
others like Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, or Dustin
Hoffman, who made their names during the 1970s, a decade many
consider the greatest in film history.
</P>
<P>
   It also means the list isn't choked with more familiar names
such as Tom Cruise, Julia Roberts, Jim Carrey, or (gasp!) Adam
Sandler. Thankfully, good box office does not a legend make.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, Elvis Presley, is on the list. Elvis Presley?
</P>
<P>
   True, Presley made some legendary bad movies _ ``Clambake,''
anyone? But this is where the second part of the criteria comes in.
Actors who made their screen debut after 1950 are eligible, so long
as their death ``marked a completed body of work.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how the deserving Steve McQueen made the list, as well as
the undeserving John Belushi. Even Divine, John Waters's 300-pound
cross-dressing muse of such fine trash as ``Pink Flamingos'' and
``Polyester'' earns a nod.
</P>
<P>
   What becomes a legend most? Well, death has certainly never
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the James Dean rule.
</P>
<P>
   Dean, who began as an actor on early television dramas and the
New York stage, didn't make his screen debut until 1951's ``Fixed
Bayonet.'' But he had his promising career cut short at age 24 when
he died in a September 1955 car accident, after only three films of
note: ``East of Eden,'' ``Rebel Without a Cause,'' and ``Giant.''
Surely no one could have a screen-legends list without Dean who,
more than 40 years after his death, has influenced virtually every
young actor who followed him.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lie the other standards for anointing a screen legend _
star quality, craft, legacy, popularity, historical context. By
that measure, many on the list have earned their status. Hattie
McDaniel, best known for her role as Mammy in ``Gone with the
Wind,'' was the first African American to win an Academy Award.
Woody Strode, featured in such films as ``Spartacus'' and
``Sergeant Rutledge,'' paved the way for such actors as Sidney
Poitier and Denzel Washington, proving black actors didn't have to
shuck and jive their way across the big screen to earn a living.
</P>
<P>
   The list also honors those who were never really stars in the
classic sense, but whose presence elevated every project in which
they appeared. They were some of the movie's great utility players
such as Thelma Ritter in ``Rear Window'' and ``All About Eve'';
Melvyn Douglas in ``Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House'' and
``Hud''; and Margaret Dumont, the perfect straight woman in such
Marx Brothers' classics as ``Duck Soup'' and ``A Night at the
Opera.'' None of those films would have been the same without them.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is, of course, a publicity stunt. The results will
be turned into a three-hour prime-time television special in June
with 50 contemporary stars (gee, are there 50 people who currently
deserve to be called stars?) paying tribute to the legends.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if the AFI has gotten anything right, it's eschewing the
simple lure of stardom. Viewed in its entirety, the greatest of
Hollywood is as much Zasu Pitts and Adolphe Menjou as Elizabeth
Taylor and Cary Grant. Regardless of which 25 actors and 25
actresses are ultimately declared screen legends, this list is
already an acknowledgment of all those who imbued the movies with
magic, from tragic silent-film comedian Roscoe ``Fatty'' Arbuckle
to the Three Stooges to King Kong's best girl, Fay Wray.
</P>
<P>
   Strip away the hype, the glossy TV special and other folderol,
and it's a salute to those who helped shape one of our culture's
most influential media. It's grand homage, to paraphase Gloria
Swanson's loopy Norma Desmond from ``Sunset Boulevard,'' to those
glorious days before the pictures _ and the stars _ got small.

   &UR; !! &LR;  1/2 ``Playing by Heart'' A mixed bag of a film about a
mixed bag of Los Angelinos looking for love. Writer-director
Willard Carroll's script often veers from contrivance to
shapelessness, but the acting ensemble led by Gena Rowlands's and
Sean Connery's older couple does a lot to carry the film past its
shortcomings. Angelina Jolie, as a young clubber who isn't afraid
to lead with her heart, is the standout among the younger set. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !!! &LR;  ``Still Crazy'' In its unexpectedly sweet way, this film about
a '70s band, trying to get it together 20 years after a memorable
flameout winningly draws upon the generous energies to be found in
rock. That and its British love of eccentricity and failure keeps
us caring about the surviving band members trying to play their way
past various midlife crises and jump start their lives and careers.
Its ambitions are modest, but it's a charmer. (R)

A SLEUTH FOLLOWS THE TRAIL OF POPE JOAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE LEGEND OF POPE JOAN 
In Search of the Truth 
By Peter Stanford 
Holt, 207 pp., $25 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are few institutions in the world so dominated by men as
the Vatican. This is a source of much unhappiness for many women in
the world, and there is no sign of change any time soon. After all,
church fathers say, Jesus chose men to be his disciples. The church
was built upon Peter's shoulders, and all his successors can claim
an apostolic and exclusively male succession from Jesus on down.
</P>
<P>
   But what if one of the men who sat on Peter's throne was
actually a woman?
</P>
<P>
   To many, such a possibility would seem preposterous. But in his
riveting new book, ``The Legend of Pope Joan,'' Peter Stanford
provides a compelling account of one of the least-known stories in
church history: In 853, an Englishwoman dressed as a man and
reigned as Pope John VIII for two years before her ruse was
uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   Most Catholics probably have never even heard of the
``she-pope,'' as Stanford calls Joan/John. Stanford, a British
journalist and former editor of The Catholic Herald, suggests
that's because the Roman Catholic Church, which has long refuted
the story of Joan as mere fable or Protestant propaganda, wants it
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Catholic Church's objection to female ordination is based
not on scripture but on tradition,'' writes Stanford in a book that
unfolds like a good mystery yarn. ``There have never been women
priests so there never can be. That argument might be difficult to
sustain if once a woman had sat on Saint Peter's throne.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, a female pope would also deal a serious blow to the
church's sacred notion that pontiffs are divinely ordained to be
the vicars of Christ on earth. ``For even if Joan fooled the men
around her, she could not have tricked God,'' Stanford argues. ``He
would have known her real identity and gender. Did God want a
female pope? And if he did, where does that leave the current
Catholic ban on women at the altar?''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford leans on circumstantial evidence to build a strong, if
not entirely convincing, case for Joan. Still, he skillfully
juggles facts, hints, and possibilities to turn out a fascinating
historical detective story.
</P>
<P>
   He gives us some tantalizing clues. There is the shrine on
Rome's Vicus Papissa _ literally the ``street of the woman pope'' _
that is believed to have once contained a statue of Joan before it
was taken down on papal orders. The street is supposedly where Joan
gave birth _ thus revealing her true gender _ and was killed.
Thereafter, papal servants report, pontiffs refused to travel down
that thoroughfare.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the bust of Pope Zachary in the Cathedral of
Siena, which 16th-century writers say replaced one of Pope Joan.
And there is a special chair with a hole in the seat that Stanford
found stored in the Vatican Museum _ reportedly used for a time to
probe the genitals of a newly elected pope to make sure of his
gender.
</P>
<P>
   To the Catholic Church, as Stanford details, the story of the
``she-pope'' is a Protestant smear campaign perpetrated in the
early years of the Reformation. ``Dedicated followers of Luther,
Calvin and Henry VIII tampered with ancient manuscripts and
inserted fictitious references to a woman pope so as to make the
papacy look foolish and hence belittle its claim to universal,
God-given authority,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Stanford's pivotal evidence comes from the passages
about Joan contained in the pre-Reformation chronicles of the
papacy written by the 13th-century Dominican priest Martin Polonus.
Basing his argument on the expertise of rare-manuscript librarians
at Oxford, Stanford claims that in succeeding centuries no one
could have duplicated the writing and illustrating style of
Polunus's era. Stanford concludes, therefore, that ``well before
the Reformation Joan was accepted as fact.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, it is precisely the 400-year gap between
Joan's pontificate and Polunus's writings that raise doubts about
the ``she-pope.'' Then again, as Stanford shrewdly points out,
there are many examples of historical events being written about
after they occurred _ for example, the Gospels' accounts of Jesus'
life and death.
</P>
<P>
   Like a hard-nosed detective, Stanford spent countless hours
combing through ancient Vatican manuscripts in several European
libraries to try to corroborate the story of Joan. The reader is
rewarded with a thorough, intelligent, and absorbing tale.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the ``she-pope'' story is true or not, the church, as
Stanford argues, should be more forthcoming about its past. The
church should, he writes, ``show a little more humility when
dictating from on high which episodes of history _ usually those
that reflect well on it _ are worthy of respect and which can be
swept under an already lumpy carpet.''

<P>
   Today Russia is closer to bloody conflict than it ever has been
since the terrible civil war of 1918-20.
</P>
<P>
   For 70 years, the Soviet Union operated a strong state
apparatus, anchored by the KGB and the Communist Party. Now its
disintegration has created a power vacuum that has yet to be
filled.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the fledgling government confronts a vast array of
problems without the power to take effective action. Unable to rely
on popular ideology or coercion to establish control, the
government must prove itself to the people and establish its
authority on the basis of its performance.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yeltsin administration has abjectly failed to do so, and
it cannot meet the most basic needs of the Russian people. Russians
know they can no longer look to the state for personal security,
law enforcement, education, sanitation, health care or even
electrical power.
</P>
<P>
   In the place of government authority, criminal groups _ the
Russian mafiya _ increasingly hold sway. Expectations raised by the
collapse of communism have been bitterly disappointed, and Moscow's
inability to govern coherently raises the specter of civil unrest.
</P>
<P>
   If internal war does strike Russia, economic deterioration will
be a prime cause. From 1989 to the present, the gross domestic
product has fallen by 50 percent. In a society where, 10 years ago,
unemployment scarcely existed, it reached 9.5 percent in 1997 with
many economists declaring the true figure to be much higher.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two percent of Russians live below the official poverty
line (earning less than $70 a month). Modern Russia can neither
collect taxes (it gathers only half the revenue it is due) nor
significantly cut spending.
</P>
<P>
   Reformers tout privatization as the country's cure-all, but in a
land without well-defined property rights or contract law and where
subsidies remain a way of life, the prospects for transition to an
American-style capitalist economy look remote at best.
</P>
<P>
   As the massive devaluation of the ruble and the current
political crisis show, Russia's condition is even worse than most
analysts feared. If conditions get worse, even the stoic Russian
people will soon run out of patience.
</P>
<P>
   A future conflict would quickly draw in Russia's military. In
the Soviet days civilian rule kept the powerful armed forces in
check. But with the Communist Party out of office, what little
civilian control remains relies on an exceedingly fragile
foundation _ personal friendships between government leaders and
military commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the morale of Russian soldiers has fallen to a
dangerous low. Drastic cuts in spending mean inadequate pay,
housing and medical care. A new emphasis on domestic missions has
created an ideological split between the old and new guard in the
military leadership, increasing the risk that disgruntled generals
may enter the political fray and feeding the resentment of soldiers
who dislike being used as a national police force.
</P>
<P>
   Newly enhanced ties between military units and local authorities
pose another danger. Soldiers grow ever more dependent on local
governments for housing, food and wages. Draftees serve closer to
home, and new laws have increased local control over the armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Were a conflict to emerge between a regional power and Moscow,
it is not at all clear which side the military would support.
Divining the military's allegiance is crucial, however, since the
structure of the Russian Federation makes it virtually certain that
regional conflicts will continue to erupt.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's 89 republics grow ever more independent in a system
that does little to keep them together. As the central government
finds itself unable to force its will beyond Moscow (if even that
far), power devolves to the periphery.
</P>
<P>
   With the economy collapsing, republics feel less and less
incentive to pay taxes to Moscow when they receive so little in
return. Three-quarters of them already have their own
constitutions, nearly all of which make some claim to sovereignty.
Strong ethnic bonds promoted by shortsighted Soviet policies may
motivate non-Russians to secede from the Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Chechnya's successful revolt against Russian control inspired
similar movements for autonomy and independence throughout the
country. If these rebellions spread and Moscow responds with force,
civil war is likely.
</P>
<P>
   Should Russia succumb to internal war, the consequences for the
United States and Europe will be severe. A major power like Russia
_ even though in decline _ does not suffer civil war quietly or
alone.
</P>
<P>
   An embattled Russian Federation might provoke opportunistic
attacks from enemies such as China. Massive flows of refugees would
pour into central and western Europe. Armed struggles in Russia
could easily spill into its neighbors. Damage from the fighting,
particularly attacks on nuclear plants, would poison the
environment of much of Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Within Russia, the consequences would be even worse. Just as the
sheer brutality of the last Russian civil war laid the basis for
the privations of Soviet communism, a second civil war might
produce another horrific regime.
</P>
<P>
   Most alarming is the real possibility that the violent
disintegration of Russia could lead to loss of control over its
nuclear arsenal. No nuclear state has ever fallen victim to civil
war, but even without a clear precedent the grim consequences can
be foreseen.
</P>
<P>
   Russia retains some 20,000 nuclear weapons and the raw material
for tens of thousands more, in scores of sites scattered throughout
the country. So far, the government has managed to prevent the loss
of any weapons or much materiel. If war erupts, however, Moscow's
already weak grip on nuclear sites will slacken, making weapons and
supplies available to a wide range of anti-American groups and
states.
</P>
<P>
   Such dispersal of nuclear weapons represents the greatest
physical threat America now faces. And it is hard to think of
anything that would increase this threat more than the chaos that
would follow a Russian civil war.
</P>
<P>
   America must reduce the chances that civil conflict in Russia
will unleash nuclear weapons against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   _ First, Washington must do more to reduce the amount of nuclear
weapons and fissionable material that could be lost, stolen, or
used in the chaos of civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The Nunn-Lugar program, under which the United States buys
Russian nuclear material to use and store in America, is a good
start, but it must be accelerated. America should not worry about
making a profit on the plutonium and enriched uranium it buys, but
just get the goods out of Russia as fast as possible.
</P>
<P>
   _ Second, arms-control initiatives that may have been
unpalatable during the Cold War should now be reconsidered, given
the risk of accidental or unauthorized launchings.
</P>
<P>
   American policymakers should contemplate agreements to reduce
the total number of Russian (and American) nuclear weapons, to
deprive the Russians of the ability to quickly launch a nuclear
strike (for example, by contracting to store warheads away from
missiles), and should intensify efforts to develop an effective
defense against missile attacks.

CELLULAR PHONE GIANT STILL SEEKS STRATEGIC DEAL IN USA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WENDY TANAKA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The acquisition of AirTouch Communications by
Britain's Vodafone Group PLC will create a wireless telephone giant
with global reach, yet the company still needs to find a partner so
it can establish a coast-to-coast presence in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it will most likely strike a joint venture agreement
with the Bell Atlantic Corp., the East Coast phone giant that lost
out to Vodafone during the bidding war for San Francisco-based
AirTouch.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Ginn, the chairman and chief executive of AirTouch, who will
become chairman of Vodafone AirTouch PLC, said that even though
AirTouch will have greater market penetration abroad under
Vodafone, it still needs to blanket the United States with its
service in order to be competitive with AT&AMP;T Corp. and Sprint PCS,
both of which have national wireless networks.
</P>
<P>
   Ginn said Bell Atlantic would be AirTouch's best bet since the
two have complementary geographic territories: AirTouch operates in
Western states while Bell Atlantic is the dominant carrier on the
East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   By striking a joint venture agreement, the two companies could
offer cheaper cellular service to their customers.
</P>
<P>
   They would accomplish this by dramatically reducing or
eliminating roaming fees _ the per minute charges AirTouch incurs
from other cellular providers when AirTouch customers place calls
outside their cellular service territories. AirTouch passes along
some of the charges to customers.
</P>
<P>
   Because AT&AMP;T has a national network, it doesn't need to charge
roaming fees since all calls end in AT&AMP;T's system. As a result,
AT&AMP;T customers pay the same amount per minute to anywhere they call
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had two strategic problems we needed to solve. We needed to
position (AirTouch) for global expansion and a national
footprint,'' Ginn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we combined with Bell Atlantic, we would have the top 50
markets in the U.S. covered. We would be at least one-and-a-half
times as big as AT&AMP;T in terms of customers and footprint
dominance.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginn said AirTouch might charge customers 12 cents per minute to
roam in another territory. The company in the territory processing
the call then charges AirTouch about 35 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's a money loser unless you control that territory,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about a potential agreement with Bell Atlantic, the loser
in the bidding war for AirTouch, Ginn said: ``In these kinds of
events, you probably need to let emotions settle. I think (Bell
Atlantic has) been quoted in the press saying they were very
disappointed. What we need to do now is dust ourselves off and get
back in the game and see if we can solve this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone AirTouch will be based in Newbury, England, with nearly
27 million customers and about 23,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The $56 billion deal, announced Jan. 15, is expected to close
within the next six months, after it receives approvals from
regulators in the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Gent, the chief executive of Vodafone, will become chief
executive of the combined company.

all being passed on to consumers by any means. Still, the weakness
in commodities does appear to be keeping the price of many consumer

 &HT;    Conductor Robert Shaw dead at 82
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Shaw, the man who taught America to sing, died at 2:05
a.m. Monday at Yale-New Haven Hospital in Connecticut. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Nola Frink, Shaw's assistant of many years, said Shaw was at
Yale on Saturday night to see his youngest son direct a student
production of Samuel Beckett's ``Endgame.''
</P>
<P>
   ``During the play, Mr. Shaw had a massive stroke,'' said Frink.
His son, Thomas; his daughter, Johanna; and his stepson, Alex Hitz,
were all at his bedside.
</P>
<P>
   The graveside service will be private. The Atlanta Symphony
Orchestra will host a public celebration of his life and legacy on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of flowers, the family requests memorial contributions
to the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra or Carnegie Hall in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw is survived by his three children from his first marriage,
Dr. Johanna Shaw of Baltimore, Md; Peter Thein Shaw of San
Francisco and John Thaddeus Shaw of the U.S. Navy ; a son from his
second marriage, Thomas Lawson Shaw, of Atlanta; and a stepson,
Alex Hitz, of Atlanta and New York.
</P>
<P>
   As leader of the Robert Shaw Chorale, he established the world's
first professional chorus and set new standards for disciplined,
powerful choral singing.
</P>
<P>
   In 21 years as music director of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra,
Shaw took the orchestra from a part-time ensemble of 60 mostly
amateur musicians with a budget of about $500,000 to a professional
symphony of 93 full-time musicians and a budget of $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   When Shaw arrived in 1967, the city had no internationally known
cultural institutions. In his first year in Atlanta, he started the
ASO Chorus. During his tenure, the chorus and orchestra made 12
critically acclaimed appearances at Carnegie Hall and toured
nationally and internationally. Shaw and the orchestra earned six
Grammy Awards before he retired in 1988 to the post of music
director emeritus and conductor laureate.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since, he had continued to conduct the orchestra
and earned nine more Grammys.
</P>
<P>
   When Shaw took the orchestra and chorus to Zurich, Paris, London
and then-divided Berlin in 1988, it was the largest performing arts
group ever to travel from America to Europe. Their stunningly
emotional performance of the Beethoven Symphony No. 9 in East
Berlin ended with nine curtain calls. The wild applause continued
even after the entire orchestra had left the stage.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the New York Times called Shaw the most important
choral conductor in the United States for the better part of five
decades.
</P>
<P>
   A man of seeming contradictions, Robert Shaw was deeply
religious, yet he was openly scornful of almost all organized
religion.
</P>
<P>
   An infamous hellion, drinker and womanizer in his early career,
Shaw turned into a devoted family man after his second marriage to
Caroline Sauls Hitz of Atlanta. He once left members of the Atlanta
orchestra management standing in the foyer of his home as they
waited to begin an important meeting while he went outside to help
his young son rebuild a go-kart.
</P>
<P>
   Given to frequent rages liberally laced with virtuoso profanity
(and afflicted with a slight stammer), he was, nevertheless, a
powerfully eloquent public speaker and a passionate cheerleader for
the importance and nobility of the arts.
</P>
<P>
   And even though he was best known as the world's greatest
conductor of 18th and 19th century choral masterpieces, Shaw was a
dogged and enthusiastic supporter of 20th century music who earned
many of his countless awards for his devotion to new music.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a defining feature of Shaw's life it was that he
never
</P>
<P>
   expected to be leader of a chorus, an orchestra conductor or a
music director before those jobs were offered to him, and he
arrived at each post, by his own admission, underprepared for the
job.
</P>
<P>
   In his own succinct phrase, Shaw's life was a parade of
unexpected invitations, and then ``makeup lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   If he had been preparing for anything, it was a career in
religion. Robert Lawson Shaw was born April 30, 1916, in Red Bluff,
Calif., the son of the Rev. Shirley Richard Shaw, a peripatetic
minister of the Christian Church, and Nelle Mae Lawson Shaw, the
daughter of a minister. One of five children, young Robert's early
musical education consisted of family sing-alongs and a little
experience leading a church choir. When he arrived at Pomona
College in California, he began studying philosophy and comparative
religion.
</P>
<P>
   But when Shaw was a freshman, the leader of the college Glee
Club fell ill, and he was elected by the other members to
substitute for a full year. It was during this period that Fred
Waring, conductor of popular choruses, arrived on campus to make a
movie, spotted Shaw and offered him a job leading Waring choruses.
Shaw originally declined, but after graduating, he agreed to join
Waring in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years, Shaw had formed his own chorus, the
Collegiate Chorale, that specialized in popular American ballads.
Soon he began attempting more serious classical works.
</P>
<P>
   Serge Koussevitzky, then conductor of the Boston Symphony
Orchestra, came to hear Shaw rehearse the Collegiate Chorale in a
Brahms motet. Although he thought Shaw naive musically,
Koussevitzky was captivated by the visceral quality of the young
man's conducting style and hired him to prepare choruses for the
Boston orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a fateful invitation from the legendary maestro of the
NBC Symphony Orchestra, Arturo Toscanini, to prepare his Collegiate
Chorale to sing the Beethoven Symphony No. 9. It was the turning
point in Shaw's career.
</P>
<P>
   A few days before the performance, Toscanini came to a chorus
rehearsal. Shaw diffidently offered the baton to Toscanini.
Toscanini refused. He asked Shaw to conduct while he listened.
Throughout the performance, Toscanini paced back and forth at the
rear of the rehearsal hall. At the end of the rehearsal Toscanini
rushed to the podium and exclaimed in his somewhat fractured
English, ``It is the first time that I hear it sung. I'll see you
at Carnegie Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Toscanini showed up at the home of a friend
and said, ``In Robert Shaw, I have at last found the maestro I have
been looking for.'' At the conclusion of a film of that
performance, Toscanini can be seen leaving the stage for a moment.
On his return, Shaw, staring at the floor, follows Toscanini
uncomfortably to stage center to share the applause. After that,
the Beethoven Ninth became Shaw's signature piece.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 120-voice Collegiate Chorale was a success, it was
made up entirely of amateur singers. (In fact, the singers were
charged $10 per year to join the chorus.) That meant virtually all
of them had outside jobs, and rehearsals could be held only once a
week. But in 1948, Shaw decided to form a full-time professional
chorus that would tour the nation and the world.
</P>
<P>
   With his new-found fame, he used his own name for the new chorus
of 42 hand-picked singers. For the next 18 years, the Robert Shaw
Chorale toured ceaselessly, to a total of 47 states and 29
countries, and made dozens of best-selling recordings _ four of
them earning Grammys.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, the Chorale toured Europe and the Middle East
performing in 15 countries. In 1964, the group toured South
America. But the Chorale's most memorable and successful tour came
in 1962, when the singers toured the Soviet Union under the
auspices of the U.S. State Department.
</P>
<P>
   They sang 60 concerts in 11 cities over a six-week span. The
tour was a stunning success. In Leningrad, music lovers lined up
all night to get tickets. In the city of Lvov, a riot developed
when several hundred people, unable to get tickets, broke down the
doors of the concert hall.
</P>
<P>
   In some cities, members of the audience refused to leave at the
end of the concert, begging for more music even after the Chorale
had left. A critic for the New York World-Telegram wrote, ``The
tour was a musical, diplomatic and spiritual triumph almost without
parallel in our time.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM HERE)
</P>
<P>
   But it was not an easy life. ``In those days when we toured with
the Chorale, there wasn't much else to do in a lot of those cities
but drink. A half bottle of Jack Daniels could disappear in a
twinkling,'' recalled Florence Kopleff, a contralto who sang for
Shaw for her entire professional career _ following him from the
founding of the Collegiate Chorale throughout his tenure as ASO
music director.
</P>
<P>
   His poorly concealed womanizing also took its toll. Shaw had
married his college sweetheart, Maxine Farley, in 1939 and together
they had three children. But during the Chorale years, they were
constantly apart and Shaw conceded they had not lived together for
15 years prior to their formal divorce in 1973. He remarried
shortly thereafter. His second wife, Caroline, died in January
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Chorale sang with virtually every major American orchestra.
But feeling his lack of formal training more intensely in these
orchestra concerts, Shaw took two years off from the Chorale
beginning in 1949 to study music theory privately with an emigre
German music professor, Julius Herford. He also learned to play the
piano and studied the theory of orchestra conducting.
</P>
<P>
   While still leading the Chorale and despite his lack of
experience in orchestral conducting, Shaw was given his first job
as a symphony music director in San Diego in 1953, leading that
orchestra in summer concerts largely consisting of lighter
classics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a bit self-conscious about my musical
background,'' Shaw said in an interview shortly before his
retirement. ``I've always been aware that I didn't have the
equipment _ perhaps even by nature, but certainly not by experience
or education.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, George Szell, music director of the Cleveland
Orchestra, asked Shaw to build a chorus for his orchestra. While
San Diego's symphony was considered a minor American ensemble at
the time, the Cleveland Orchestra was acknowledged as one of the
best in the world and George Szell was considered one of the
world's greatest living conductors. Under Szell, Shaw's ``makeup
lessons'' continued.
</P>
<P>
   During his first year in Atlanta, Shaw took the unprecedented
step in a city still largely segregated of establishing a weeklong
residency at historically-black Spelman College. Throughout his
Atlanta career, Shaw constantly sought wider involvement of the
orchestra with city's African-American community. He became closely
associated with the late Wendell Whalum, conductor of the Morehouse
Glee Club (in which the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. had sung), and
frequently conducted choruses at black churches.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Shaw gave the world premiere of the Scott Joplin opera
``Treemonisha.'' Shaw also commissioned new works from a half-dozen
African-American composers and hired African-Americans T.J.
Anderson and Alvin Singleton as the orchestra's first two composers
in residence.
</P>
<P>
   Five years after Shaw's arrival, the sunny honeymoon was clouded
by a storm. In 1972, the orchestra board members voted not to renew
his contract. During his first four seasons, Shaw had insisted on
programming the complex contemporary music of Penderecki,
Schoenberg, Webern, Lutoslawski and Ligeti, among others.
</P>
<P>
   When Shaw announced his fifth season including 10 works by
American iconoclast Charles Ives, it was the last straw. Concerned
about lagging ticket sales and convinced that Shaw's adventurous
programming of 20th-century music was partly to blame, some board
members said quietly that it might be easier to sell tickets with a
conductor more responsive to popular taste.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristically, Shaw refused to be pushed. A campaign was
mounted to show support for him in the most potent way possible _
advance ticket sales for a music season more than six months away.
Within two weeks, 3,500 new season subscribers sent in checks, but
all carried the notation that Shaw should conduct. The board
relented and he was rehired. But within two more years, Shaw
threatened to resign twice more over philosophical differences with
ASO management.
</P>
<P>
   The mercurial maestro's temper was well known. Boston's
Koussevitzky, who offered Shaw his first symphony orchestra job and
was a noted disciplinarian himself, said of Shaw that he was
``amazed that any group of adults would willingly endure such
tyrannical treatment from a conductor.''
</P>
<P>
   During rehearsals, Shaw raged at his choristers, but was more
restrained with members of the orchestra. He sat on a stool,
invariably dressed in the midnight blue rehearsal shirts he favored
(even his formal conducting suit of tails was midnight blue instead
of the traditional black), sweating so profusely that the pages of
his music scores were wrinkled from years of contact with
perspiration.
</P>
<P>
   At the intermission of concerts, Shaw usually showered and put
on a second, dry suit of white tie and tails.
</P>
<P>
   For his entire professional career, Shaw wrote a formal letter
following each rehearsal _ invariably on Monday evenings _ with his
choruses. Always beginning, ``Dear People,'' the letters were both
didactic sermons on musical performance practice and wide-ranging
philosophical ruminations.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing for a performance of the Beethoven Ninth, Shaw used
his ``Dear People'' letter to chide his choristers: ``Our tenors
are adolescent. Our altos have not passed puberty. Our sopranos
trip their dainty ballet of coloratura decorum, and our basses woof
their wittle gway woofs all the way home...Get your backs and
bellies into it! You can't sing Beethoven from the neck up _ you'll
bleed! Beethoven is not precious. He's prodigal as hell. He
tramples all over nicety. He's ugly, heroic; he roars, he lusts
after beauty, he rages after nobility. Be ye not temperate!''
</P>
<P>
   On the occasion of Shaw's retirement in 1988, tributes were
written by everyone from President Reagan to Leonard Bernstein.
Most were standard salutes to Shaw's long tenure and significant
contributions to the city, state and nation.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Roy Acuff, Gregory Peck and others, Shaw received the
Kennedy Center Honors in 1991. He was appointed a member of the
National Council on the Arts by President Carter and received,
among other awards, the National Federation of Music Awards Alice
M. Ditson medal, Yale University's Samuel Simons Sanford medal, and
the first Fulton County Arts Award for his ``monumental artistic
achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw guest-conducted the Chicago Symphony, New York Philarmonic,
Boston Symphony and others. He received more than 15 honorary
degrees, including those from Emory and Oglethorpe Universities in
Atlanta, the New England Conservatory of Music and the Cleveland
Insitute of Music.
</P>
<P>
   He spent four months of each year at the village of Dordogne,
Courzon, France where he conducted a Robert Shaw Institute and
festival, supported by Ohio State University.
</P>
<P>
   Famed composer and diarist Ned Rorem wrote a peaen to what he
considered the heart of Shaw's artistry: ``There may be other
conductors in the world who are as good as Shaw, in their different
ways, but none is better _ or, to me _ so special. He is at once
tasteful and reckless, icy and scalding, intellectual and
emotional, ruby hued yet capable of the purity of autumn snow. Each
of these attributes is utterly unflawed and utterly communicable.
There's nothing he cannot do.''

COURT REJECTS CLINTON PLAN TO USE SAMPLING FOR 2000 CENSUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday rejected President
Clinton's plan to use a new method for the 2000 Census that could
have altered America's political landscape and redirected billions
of dollars in federal money in favor of urban and rural minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The method would have employed statistical sampling to help
determine the number of people in the United States rather than
having the government rely completely on the traditional system of
mailing out questionnaires and then dispatching thousands of
enumerators to hunt down those who don't respond.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling 5-4 in favor of a group of citizens who stood to lose
politically and economically because of the administration plan,
the high court said federal census law bans the use of statistical
methods in conducting the decennial census.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling means that a traditional undercourt of urban and
rural minorities during the census likely will happen again in
2000. The National Academy of Sciences found that in 1990 the
counting methods employed by the Census Bureau missed some 4
million minorities and double-counted about 4.4 million people,
mostly suburban whites.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans had fought the Clinton plan, which
could have threatened their control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists from both political parties said sampling would have
turned up increases in the number of people living in historically
Democratic cities and rural areas, giving the party an advantage
when new boundaries for congressional, state and local legislative
districts are drawn after the 2000 Census has been completed.
</P>
<P>
   These strategists also said that since sampling would find
increases in the number of poor people counted in urban and rural
areas, cities and agricultural counties would receive extra federal
dollars at the expense of suburban communities. Census figures are
also used for allocating about $180 billion in federal funds each
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution requires an ``actual enumeration'' of the
nation's population every 10 years to help divide the 435 members
of the House of Representatives among the states.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration had argued that amendments to the
census law in 1976 permitted the use of sampling to aid traditional
counting methods.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the court, said,
``At no point during the debates over these amendments did a single
member of Congress suggest that the amendments would so
fundamentally change the manner in which (Census Bureau) could
calculate the population.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that ``it tests the limits of reason'' to suggest that
Congress would have been silent in enacting ``what would arguably
be the single most significant change in the method of conducting
the decennial census since its inception.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan had been challenged by taxpayers in six states _
Connecticut, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Pennsylvania and
Wisconsin _ who said sampling would cost them federal money and
political power.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans also sued, saying the Constitution and federal
census law allow only a person-by-person head count.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the suits, the administration argued that neither
the group of taxpayers nor Congress had a right to sue because the
2000 Census had yet to be conducted, which meant nobody could prove
that they would be hurt.
</P>
<P>
   However, two lower courts ruled separately last year that both
the taxpayers and Congress had a right to sue. The two courts also
ruled that federal census law does not allow adjustment of census
figures used for apportioning the House members among the states,
as the administration sampling plan would have done.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's ruling, the Supreme Court agreed that the taxpayers
had legal standing to sue. But it dismissed the House Republicans'
suit. The high court also ruled that the 1976 amendments, which
permitted sampling to be used in evaluating information gathered
during the census, did not extend its use for apportionment
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said that because the census law barred the use of
statistical sampling, the high court was not deciding whether such
methods would violate the Constitution's ``actual enumeration''
language.
</P>
<P>
   The high court had aimed for an early decision in the case to
give the government time to plan for the census, scheduled for
April 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Joining O'Connor's decision were Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and
Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting were Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter,
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer, who said the federal
census law did not bar the government from adjusting the figures.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the Clinton plan hailed the ruling as a ``victory''
for the Constitution and promised that the counting errors made in
1990 would be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court today reaffirmed a basic constitutional
principle. The census must not be a poll and everyone must be
counted,'' House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the House subcommittee that
overseas Census Bureau appropriations, said members of his staff
and Census officials have been travelling to traditionally
undercounted areas to meet with local officials to work on ways to
ensure all people are accounted for in the 2000 census.

   Shaw is survived by his three children from his first marriage,
Dr. Johanna Shaw of Baltimore, Md; Peter Thein Shaw of San
Francisco and John Thaddeus Shaw of the U.S. Navy ; a son from his
second marriage, Thomas Lawson Shaw, of Atlanta; and a stepson,
Alex Hitz, of Atlanta and New York.
</P>
<P>
   As leader of the Robert Shaw Chorale, he established the world's
first professional chorus and set new standards for disciplined,
powerful choral singing.
</P>
<P>
   In 21 years as music director of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra,
Shaw took the orchestra from a part-time ensemble of 60 mostly
amateur musicians with a budget of about $500,000 to a professional
symphony of 93 full-time musicians and a budget of $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   When Shaw arrived in 1967, the city had no internationally known
cultural institutions. In his first year in Atlanta, he started the
ASO Chorus. During his tenure, the chorus and orchestra made 12
critically acclaimed appearances at Carnegie Hall and toured
nationally and internationally. Shaw and the orchestra earned six
Grammy Awards before he retired in 1988 to the post of music
director emeritus and conductor laureate.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since, he had continued to conduct the orchestra
and earned nine more Grammys.
</P>
<P>
   When Shaw took the orchestra and chorus to Zurich, Paris, London
and then-divided Berlin in 1988, it was the largest performing arts
group ever to travel from America to Europe. Their stunningly
emotional performance of the Beethoven Symphony No. 9 in East
Berlin ended with nine curtain calls. The wild applause continued
even after the entire orchestra had left the stage.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the New York Times called Shaw the most important
choral conductor in the United States for the better part of five
decades.
</P>
<P>
   A man of seeming contradictions, Robert Shaw was deeply
religious, yet he was openly scornful of almost all organized
religion.
</P>
<P>
   An infamous hellion, drinker and womanizer in his early career,
Shaw turned into a devoted family man after his second marriage to
Caroline Sauls Hitz of Atlanta. He once left members of the Atlanta
orchestra management standing in the foyer of his home as they
waited to begin an important meeting while he went outside to help
his young son rebuild a go-kart.
</P>
<P>
   Given to frequent rages liberally laced with virtuoso profanity
(and afflicted with a slight stammer), he was, nevertheless, a
powerfully eloquent public speaker and a passionate cheerleader for
the importance and nobility of the arts.
</P>
<P>
   And even though he was best known as the world's greatest
conductor of 18th and 19th century choral masterpieces, Shaw was a
dogged and enthusiastic supporter of 20th century music who earned
many of his countless awards for his devotion to new music.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a defining feature of Shaw's life it was that he
never
</P>
<P>
   expected to be leader of a chorus, an orchestra conductor or a
music director before those jobs were offered to him, and he
arrived at each post, by his own admission, underprepared for the
job.
</P>
<P>
   In his own succinct phrase, Shaw's life was a parade of
unexpected invitations, and then ``makeup lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   If he had been preparing for anything, it was a career in
religion. Robert Lawson Shaw was born April 30, 1916, in Red Bluff,
Calif., the son of the Rev. Shirley Richard Shaw, a peripatetic
minister of the Christian Church, and Nelle Mae Lawson Shaw, the
daughter of a minister. One of five children, young Robert's early
musical education consisted of family sing-alongs and a little
experience leading a church choir. When he arrived at Pomona
College in California, he began studying philosophy and comparative
religion.
</P>
<P>
   But when Shaw was a freshman, the leader of the college Glee
Club fell ill, and he was elected by the other members to
substitute for a full year. It was during this period that Fred
Waring, conductor of popular choruses, arrived on campus to make a
movie, spotted Shaw and offered him a job leading Waring choruses.
Shaw originally declined, but after graduating, he agreed to join
Waring in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years, Shaw had formed his own chorus, the
Collegiate Chorale, that specialized in popular American ballads.
Soon he began attempting more serious classical works.
</P>
<P>
   Serge Koussevitzky, then conductor of the Boston Symphony
Orchestra, came to hear Shaw rehearse the Collegiate Chorale in a
Brahms motet. Although he thought Shaw naive musically,
Koussevitzky was captivated by the visceral quality of the young
man's conducting style and hired him to prepare choruses for the
Boston orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a fateful invitation from the legendary maestro of the
NBC Symphony Orchestra, Arturo Toscanini, to prepare his Collegiate
Chorale to sing the Beethoven Symphony No. 9. It was the turning
point in Shaw's career.
</P>
<P>
   A few days before the performance, Toscanini came to a chorus
rehearsal. Shaw diffidently offered the baton to Toscanini.
Toscanini refused. He asked Shaw to conduct while he listened.
Throughout the performance, Toscanini paced back and forth at the
rear of the rehearsal hall. At the end of the rehearsal Toscanini
rushed to the podium and exclaimed in his somewhat fractured
English, ``It is the first time that I hear it sung. I'll see you
at Carnegie Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Toscanini showed up at the home of a friend
and said, ``In Robert Shaw, I have at last found the maestro I have
been looking for.'' At the conclusion of a film of that
performance, Toscanini can be seen leaving the stage for a moment.
On his return, Shaw, staring at the floor, follows Toscanini
uncomfortably to stage center to share the applause. After that,
the Beethoven Ninth became Shaw's signature piece.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 120-voice Collegiate Chorale was a success, it was
made up entirely of amateur singers. (In fact, the singers were
charged $10 per year to join the chorus.) That meant virtually all
of them had outside jobs, and rehearsals could be held only once a
week. But in 1948, Shaw decided to form a full-time professional
chorus that would tour the nation and the world.
</P>
<P>
   With his new-found fame, he used his own name for the new chorus
of 42 hand-picked singers. For the next 18 years, the Robert Shaw
Chorale toured ceaselessly, to a total of 47 states and 29
countries, and made dozens of best-selling recordings _ four of
them earning Grammys.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, the Chorale toured Europe and the Middle East
performing in 15 countries. In 1964, the group toured South
America. But the Chorale's most memorable and successful tour came
in 1962, when the singers toured the Soviet Union under the
auspices of the U.S. State Department.
</P>
<P>
   They sang 60 concerts in 11 cities over a six-week span. The
tour was a stunning success. In Leningrad, music lovers lined up
all night to get tickets. In the city of Lvov, a riot developed
when several hundred people, unable to get tickets, broke down the
doors of the concert hall.
</P>
<P>
   In some cities, members of the audience refused to leave at the
end of the concert, begging for more music even after the Chorale
had left. A critic for the New York World-Telegram wrote, ``The
tour was a musical, diplomatic and spiritual triumph almost without
parallel in our time.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM HERE)
</P>
<P>
   But it was not an easy life. ``In those days when we toured with
the Chorale, there wasn't much else to do in a lot of those cities
but drink. A half bottle of Jack Daniels could disappear in a
twinkling,'' recalled Florence Kopleff, a contralto who sang for
Shaw for her entire professional career _ following him from the
founding of the Collegiate Chorale throughout his tenure as ASO
music director.
</P>
<P>
   His poorly concealed womanizing also took its toll. Shaw had
married his college sweetheart, Maxine Farley, in 1939 and together
they had three children. But during the Chorale years, they were
constantly apart and Shaw conceded they had not lived together for
15 years prior to their formal divorce in 1973. He remarried
shortly thereafter. His second wife, Caroline, died in January
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Chorale sang with virtually every major American orchestra.
But feeling his lack of formal training more intensely in these
orchestra concerts, Shaw took two years off from the Chorale
beginning in 1949 to study music theory privately with an emigre
German music professor, Julius Herford. He also learned to play the
piano and studied the theory of orchestra conducting.
</P>
<P>
   While still leading the Chorale and despite his lack of
experience in orchestral conducting, Shaw was given his first job
as a symphony music director in San Diego in 1953, leading that
orchestra in summer concerts largely consisting of lighter
classics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a bit self-conscious about my musical
background,'' Shaw said in an interview shortly before his
retirement. ``I've always been aware that I didn't have the
equipment _ perhaps even by nature, but certainly not by experience
or education.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, George Szell, music director of the Cleveland
Orchestra, asked Shaw to build a chorus for his orchestra. While
San Diego's symphony was considered a minor American ensemble at
the time, the Cleveland Orchestra was acknowledged as one of the
best in the world and George Szell was considered one of the
world's greatest living conductors. Under Szell, Shaw's ``makeup
lessons'' continued.
</P>
<P>
   During his first year in Atlanta, Shaw took the unprecedented
step in a city still largely segregated of establishing a weeklong
residency at historically-black Spelman College. Throughout his
Atlanta career, Shaw constantly sought wider involvement of the
orchestra with city's African-American community. He became closely
associated with the late Wendell Whalum, conductor of the Morehouse
Glee Club (in which the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. had sung), and
frequently conducted choruses at black churches.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Shaw gave the world premiere of the Scott Joplin opera
``Treemonisha.'' Shaw also commissioned new works from a half-dozen
African-American composers and hired African-Americans T.J.
Anderson and Alvin Singleton as the orchestra's first two composers
in residence.
</P>
<P>
   Five years after Shaw's arrival, the sunny honeymoon was clouded
by a storm. In 1972, the orchestra board members voted not to renew
his contract. During his first four seasons, Shaw had insisted on
programming the complex contemporary music of Penderecki,
Schoenberg, Webern, Lutoslawski and Ligeti, among others.
</P>
<P>
   When Shaw announced his fifth season including 10 works by
American iconoclast Charles Ives, it was the last straw. Concerned
about lagging ticket sales and convinced that Shaw's adventurous
programming of 20th-century music was partly to blame, some board
members said quietly that it might be easier to sell tickets with a
conductor more responsive to popular taste.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristically, Shaw refused to be pushed. A campaign was
mounted to show support for him in the most potent way possible _
advance ticket sales for a music season more than six months away.
Within two weeks, 3,500 new season subscribers sent in checks, but
all carried the notation that Shaw should conduct. The board
relented and he was rehired. But within two more years, Shaw
threatened to resign twice more over philosophical differences with
ASO management.
</P>
<P>
   The mercurial maestro's temper was well known. Boston's
Koussevitzky, who offered Shaw his first symphony orchestra job and
was a noted disciplinarian himself, said of Shaw that he was
``amazed that any group of adults would willingly endure such
tyrannical treatment from a conductor.''
</P>
<P>
   During rehearsals, Shaw raged at his choristers, but was more
restrained with members of the orchestra. He sat on a stool,
invariably dressed in the midnight blue rehearsal shirts he favored
(even his formal conducting suit of tails was midnight blue instead
of the traditional black), sweating so profusely that the pages of
his music scores were wrinkled from years of contact with
perspiration.
</P>
<P>
   At the intermission of concerts, Shaw usually showered and put
on a second, dry suit of white tie and tails.
</P>
<P>
   For his entire professional career, Shaw wrote a formal letter
following each rehearsal _ invariably on Monday evenings _ with his
choruses. Always beginning, ``Dear People,'' the letters were both
didactic sermons on musical performance practice and wide-ranging
philosophical ruminations.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing for a performance of the Beethoven Ninth, Shaw used
his ``Dear People'' letter to chide his choristers: ``Our tenors
are adolescent. Our altos have not passed puberty. Our sopranos
trip their dainty ballet of coloratura decorum, and our basses woof
their wittle gway woofs all the way home...Get your backs and
bellies into it! You can't sing Beethoven from the neck up _ you'll
bleed! Beethoven is not precious. He's prodigal as hell. He
tramples all over nicety. He's ugly, heroic; he roars, he lusts
after beauty, he rages after nobility. Be ye not temperate!''
</P>
<P>
   On the occasion of Shaw's retirement in 1988, tributes were
written by everyone from President Reagan to Leonard Bernstein.
Most were standard salutes to Shaw's long tenure and significant
contributions to the city, state and nation.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Roy Acuff, Gregory Peck and others, Shaw received the
Kennedy Center Honors in 1991. He was appointed a member of the
National Council on the Arts by President Carter and received,
among other awards, the National Federation of Music Awards Alice
M. Ditson medal, Yale University's Samuel Simons Sanford medal, and
the first Fulton County Arts Award for his ``monumental artistic
achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw guest-conducted the Chicago Symphony, New York Philarmonic,
Boston Symphony and others. He received more than 15 honorary
degrees, including those from Emory and Oglethorpe Universities in
Atlanta, the New England Conservatory of Music and the Cleveland
Insitute of Music.
</P>
<P>
   He spent four months of each year at the village of Dordogne,
Courzon, France where he conducted a Robert Shaw Institute and
festival, supported by Ohio State University.
</P>
<P>
   Famed composer and diarist Ned Rorem wrote a peaen to what he
considered the heart of Shaw's artistry: ``There may be other
conductors in the world who are as good as Shaw, in their different
ways, but none is better _ or, to me _ so special. He is at once
tasteful and reckless, icy and scalding, intellectual and
emotional, ruby hued yet capable of the purity of autumn snow. Each
of these attributes is utterly unflawed and utterly communicable.
There's nothing he cannot do.''

AS PHONE RATES DROP, SOME GO WIRELESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL AND PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As cell phone rates plummet as low as 10 cents a minute for
calls made any time and anywhere in the country, it's easy to
believe a marketing slogan from AT &AMP; T Wireless: Your wireless
phone could be your only phone.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, these one-rate national plans offered by all of the
wireless firms in Boston are attractive. You buy a huge bucket of
minutes, from several hundred to 1,500, for calls made any time to
any state, with no long-distance or extra charges.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't come here yet, but consider this little-publicized
experiment outside Dallas. AT &AMP; T Wireless is offering unlimited
local calls for $40 a month. Long-distance calls are only a dime a
minute.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Cerniglia, 46, doesn't need any convincing about the
benefits of a full-time cellular life. The advertising salesman
uses his cell phone for all business and personal calls, and is
considering snipping his home-based wired line.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wireless phone is my exclusive phone,'' he said through his
cell phone. ``Everybody calls me on this phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Called ``cutting the cord'' by industry analysts, this
mini-trend finds people abandoning their home wired line for the
cellular phone. It's a phenomenon led largely by single people on
the go, such as college students, and business people who travel a
lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people were finding that their home phone was becoming
a receptacle for voice mail messages,'' said Karin Olson,
spokeswoman for Omnipoint.
</P>
<P>
   Even if people keep their home-based phone, some like these
one-rate national cellular plans as a second line and place many
long-distance calls from them.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Goldberg, editor of Wireless Dimension.com, said relying on
a wireless phone still doesn't make sense for most adults who
remain centered at a home location and make many local calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't hear about a lot of families with two kids doing
this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   First, remember that only one phone number can be assigned to
each wireless handset. There's no such thing as extensions of the
same number. Imagine answering a phone call for a teenager who is
upstairs in a bedroom. Do you really want to throw the handset up a
flight of stairs?
</P>
<P>
   Also, keep in mind that wireless phone users pay for all calls
received, and initiated, by the handset. In Europe and much of the
rest of the world, cellular users generally pay for only calls they
make, but there's two-way charging in this country and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 minutes may seem impossible to use up, but not
if you're docked for all incoming calls.
</P>
<P>
   And you may be surprised how many local minutes you rack up in a
month. Industry estimates show that the average adult makes about
450 minutes in local calls a month. But that's only calls
initiated, not received. If you consider a home with two adults who
get as many calls as they make, that household would use up about
1,800 minutes in local calls alone.
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, consumers pay less by staying with their
local carrier, such as Bell Atlantic, where calling plans put local
calls in the range of several pennies a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Lowenstein, senior vice president of the Yankee Group, a
Boston telecommunications research group, said consumers choosing a
wireless phone life should also remember that voice quality can be
erratic with some cellular carriers, and battery life, at best, is
about four hours.
</P>
<P>
   When choosing a cellular company, consider that they don't all
have the same geographic reach. Some one-rate plans also require
that your calls originate from the East Coast or some metropolitan
centers.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic Mobile has a special 500-minute plan for $59.99.
The calls must be initiated within the East Coast region, but can
go out to anywhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side for total-cellular users, the price of their
one-rate plans automatically includes extra services, such as
call-waiting, voice mail, and caller ID. These plans have no
``roaming'' charges. Under other wireless plans, customers pay such
roaming charges, which are applied when they move outside their
carrier's home network and borrow services from another carrier.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're a Sprint PCS customer who finds the allotment of
minutes offered more than you can use, you can share the minutes
with another customer for an extra $15 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The pros and cons of the cut-the-cord lifestyle were obvious
during our conversation last week with a cellular user.
</P>
<P>
   We heard that John Carozza, an actor, was about to cut his
home-based wired line in favor of his Sprint PCS cell phone. When
we called his cell phone, we reached him with perfect reception.
And he was in Los Angeles on business. He was on his way to Utah,
but said we could still reach him. Just call the same phone number.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm within reach everywhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It sounded so wonderful, but less so when we realized that he,
too, had to pay for the 10-minute call we placed.

   It's that time of year when many people put down hefty deposits
for summer rentals, youth camp programs, and nursery and private
school tuitions. It's good to keep in mind a few things before you
hand over the money.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most important is to make the deposit with a credit
card, if possible. Under federal regulations regarding credit card
use, you may have some leverage if you end up dissatisfied and want
money back.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that real estate agencies, schools and most
businesses can set any policy they want regarding the deposit
amount, cancellation fees, and refund rules as long as they
disclose the policy to you in advance, said Diane Szafarowicz,
assistant attorney general in the consumer protection division.
There's also nothing stopping them from asking for a full up-front
payment.
</P>
<P>
   (Exceptions are auto dealers and home-improvement contractors
who must follow industry-specific state laws on deposits.)
</P>
<P>
   If you cancel your plans and want your money back, Szafarowicz
said, state common law says the amount they keep must be
``reasonable in relation to the injury suffered.'' But if the
business disclosed the rules and you signed the contract, you may
have a hard time proving your case.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Szafarowicz said, consumers should remember to use a
credit card if they can, put down as little as possible, and read
the contract carefully.

   John Pakstis, a psychologist, found that today's gas prices _
often under $1 a gallon _ don't apply at the rental car agency
pump. In a rush, he failed to fill the gas tank when he returned
his Hertz rental in Baltimore. He was charged $3.70 a gallon for 10
gallons. The $37 charge was nearly the cost of his two-day rental.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there any regulation on what they can charge for gas?'' he
asked us in a recent e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently not. The attorney general's office said the agency
can set its own gas price if it discloses it in writing in the
contract (which Hertz did in small print) and the amount is not
``unconscionably'' high.
</P>
<P>
   While $3.70 a gallon is exorbitant, the attorney general's
office staff said it would be hard to prove it was
``unconscionably'' high given that it is not the rental agency's
job to fill tanks with gas.
</P>
<P>
   Pakstis said he was offered the Hertz pre-paid plan, in which
customers pay Hertz in advance to refuel the car. If he had
purchased this plan, Pakstis would have paid $1.10 a gallon, or
about $11 for a full tank.
</P>
<P>
   The Andover, Mass. man said he has bought this pre-paid plan
before, but found himself driving around to use up gas. After all,
he had already paid for a full re-fueling and didn't think the
rental agency should get the extra money.

 By ISABEL ALLENDE  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Many years ago I was asked whether I planned someday to write a
novel about Pinochet.
 &HT;    No, I said, because as a character he was insignificant.
 &HT;    I need to retract that statement: One can say anything about him
except that he is insignificant. The general has held Chile in his
grip for 25 years and is still the most influential figure in the
country. A decade after he stepped down from the presidency, the
old dictator still holds the democratic government hostage.
 &HT;    For now, however, the general too is being held. He is under
house arrest in a London mansion, awaiting a final decision on an
extradition request by a Spanish magistrate, Baltasar Garzon, who
has accused him of crimes against humanity _ genocide, torture and
terrorism _ committed against Spanish citizens in Chile.
 &HT;    The request ignited a debate in Britain and Chile and throughout
the West on the wisdom and fairness of bringing former rulers to
trial for human-rights violations. As far as Augusto Pinochet is
concerned, however, the intellectual questions are moot.
 &HT;    By pursuing the general, assembling a strong legal case and
issuing the extradition request, Garzon has already achieved the
salutary result of Pinochet's moral ruin. Henceforth, a man who had
the gall to pose as his nation's savior will take his place
alongside Caligula and Idi Amin. Even if Pinochet never faces a
tribunal, justice has been done.
 &HT;    Pinochet has long stood as a symbol of brutality for the simple
reason that he was and always will be linked to Salvador Allende,
an icon of social justice in the early 1970s. Allende was the first
Marxist politician in the world to win the presidency of a country
in a free election. In the middle of the Cold War, he proposed
``the Chilean road toward Socialism,'' respecting the Constitution
and all the rights of the citizens. His dream was to build the kind
of Social Democratic government that every country in Europe _
except Spain and Ireland _ has today.
 &HT;    Salvador Allende was my father's cousin; in a Latin family, that
made him my uncle. I knew him well and loved him with a mixture of
admiration and anxiety. Although he was a kind man with a good
sense of humor, I always felt it was impossible to live up to his
standards and expectations.
 &HT;    Trained as a physician, he was well acquainted with the needs of
the poor. He was a founder of the Socialist Party, and was
appointed secretary of health at a young age.
 &HT;    In 1970, after three failed attempts, Allende finally won the
presidency in a sharply divided election. He was a minority
president, having received only 36 percent of the vote. And even
then, his coalition, Unidad Popular, was made up of several parties
that rarely saw eye to eye on anything. It was a political weakness
that was to stalk his presidency.
 &HT;    But that wasn't his biggest problem. Immediately after the
election results were in, the CIA and the Chilean right began a
campaign of terror to prevent him from assuming his post. They
planned the kidnapping of Ren Schneider, the commander in chief of
the armed forces, in order to provoke a military coup. But the plot
backfired, Schneider was killed and Allende became president.
 &HT;    The government nationalized the banks, many industries and the
copper mines, which represented the country's principal source of
revenue and which were in the hands of North American capitalists.
At that point the opposition, backed by the CIA, undertook a series
of actions intended to destabilize the economy. To make matters
worse, the government was paralyzed by power struggles within the
Unidad Popular.
 &HT;    The ensuing economic crisis reached staggering proportions. The
inflation rate soared to 350 percent amid shortages of every kind,
from food to spare parts for essential machines. Laborers and
farmers responded by taking over factories and farms. Armed groups
sprang up on the right and the left.
 &HT;    Remarkably, in spite of this somber picture, the Unidad Popular
actually increased its percentage of the vote in the 1973
parliamentary elections. In view of this, the opposition decided
that economic, political and social destabilization was not enough
to finish Allende. More drastic measures were needed.
 &HT;    With the country in an uproar, Salvador Allende decided to hold
a plebiscite. He planned to announce it on Sept. 10, as he notified
Pinochet (by then the head of the armed forces), but the general
asked him to postpone it until the 12th. The president did not live
to see that day.
 &HT;    On Sept. 11, the military coup took place that would leave a
profound mark on Chile's soul. Salvador Allende took his life in
the burning presidential palace.
 &HT;    That morning I left my home early. The streets were practically
empty, making me think that the bus drivers were striking again.
Then I saw military vehicles, tanks and groups of heavily armed
soldiers.
 &HT;    As I didn't have a radio in the car, I went to the house of a
friend nearby to listen to the news. She was very distressed: her
husband, a teacher, had gone to the school where he taught, and she
had not heard from him. By then all the radio stations, except one,
had been silenced by the military.
 &HT;    I went downtown to pick up her husband, which is how I ended up
witnessing the bombing of La Moneda palace. I heard my uncle's last
words on my friend's portable radio. We held hands crying as he
calmly addressed the country with a historic speech that later
would be broadcast and published all over the world.
 &HT;    Having declared that he would never resign his office, he
refused to flee the country in a plane offered by the generals. It
was the right choice, and not only because his heroic death
confirmed his place in history. Had he accepted their offer to go
into exile, we now know, Pinochet would have murdered him during
the flight. ``Kill the bitch and you eliminate the litter,'' he
said.
 &HT;    Until just before the coup, Pinochet was an obscure army
general. He had been elevated to the rank of commander in chief of
the armed forces by Allende himself only three weeks before, after
Gen. Carlos Prats resigned under pressure from the opposition.
Prats recommended Pinochet to Allende, saying he was a loyal
soldier who could be trusted to uphold the Constitution. (Prats,
who ended up in exile in Argentina, was eventually murdered on
orders from Pinochet.)
 &HT;    Pinochet was the last to join the insurrection, after the
marines, the air force and the police. The military junta that he
would soon command abolished Congress, muzzled the press, suspended
constitutional guarantees and began the systematic elimination of
the left. The right toasted with Champagne while leftists ran for
their lives and the rest of the population was dumbfounded.
 &HT;    Pinochet persecuted labor and student leaders, politicians,
intellectuals, artists and journalists, as well as all those who
were a part of the government of the Unidad Popular. The worst
repression was carried out against the lower classes, long viewed
by the military as the prime breeding ground of Marxism. The people
were punished for having dared defy those who had always held
political and economic power.
 &HT;    Thousands of Chileans were arrested, others found asylum in
embassies or escaped across the border, while many simply
disappeared. Torture centers and concentration camps were set up
throughout the country. Hundreds of prisoners were thrown from
planes into the sea _ after their bellies were slit open to make
sure that they would sink _ or blown to bits or plowed under by
bulldozers.
 &HT;    Fear became a way of life. Voices of protest were raised in most
of the world, because the socialist experiment of Salvador Allende
had aroused great sympathy, but Washington supported the
dictatorship of Pinochet.
 &HT;    The general changed the Constitution to designate himself
president. His desire for legitimacy is one of the many paradoxes
of his character. In early photographs he is wearing dark glasses,
his arms folded across his chest and his jaw thrust forward in a
caricature of the Latin American dictator. Later he modified his
image, wearing impeccable suits and shedding the sinister dark
glasses.
 &HT;    Today, at 83, Pinochet looks like a sly old grandfather. He
declares himself ``the defender of Western Christian
civilization,'' is ultraconservative in his politics,
nationalistic, like most military men, and considers himself a
practicing Catholic _ which apparently to him does not seem a
contradiction.
 &HT;    His hero is Napoleon, to whom he likes to be compared. There is
even a Pinochet Foundation, dedicated to assuring his place in
history as the Chilean Napoleon who saved the country from
communism, a task that some ``pinochetistas'' claim was assigned to
him directly by God. If this is not magical realism, it is quite
close.
 &HT;    Pinochet is characterized by his cunning. He surrounded himself
with the most intelligent ideologues of the right. He transformed
the economy of Chile, moving from social democracy to the
capitalism of Milton Friedman, but with little of the freedom
promised by the Chicago School.
 &HT;    Entrepreneurs and investors were in paradise. They enjoyed the
benefits of the free market but did not have to deal with unions;
workers were plentiful, cheap and submissive. The state still
intervened in the economy, but always in favor of the capitalists.
Greed became the new religion. Almost everything was privatized,
even hospitals and public schools.
 &HT;    Taken together, this created an economic boom and the basis for
sustained progress, which is the main argument of those who defend
Pinochet. But they can't disregard the social costs. This savage
capitalist revolution came out of the hides of the poor, who were
supposed to be satisfied with the crumbs trickling down from the
wealthy.
 &HT;    For the poorest of the poor, the trickle-down never did occur.
Today, a third of Chile's 15 million inhabitants still live in
poverty.
 &HT;    Although they may detest the general, most Chileans maintain
that he should not be judged in a foreign court for crimes
committed in Chile. They see the intervention of Spain and Britain
as colonialist. How would Americans react if Spain demanded the
extradition of Henry Kissinger or a former CIA director to stand
trial for the same atrocities that Pinochet is accused of?
 &HT;    There is an obvious double standard when it comes to European
and North American relations with less powerful nations. On the
other hand, there is no question that Pinochet could never be
judged in Chile. Despite the law of amnesty, there are 14 suits
against him pending in Chilean courts, but there is little chance
that he will ever face justice.
 &HT;    In Chile there is great caution with regard to the general, who
still has the support of 25 percent of the population. Among that
group is at least 80 percent of the wealthy and all the military. A
climate of hysteria reigns among the ultraright. The press,
controlled by the right, asserts that Pinochet's detention
humiliates all Chileans. According to a recent poll, however, 70
percent of the people don't care about his fate.
 &HT;    The general is still powerful and feared. The military is
exerting pressure, but there is no real danger of a coup.
Certainly, they are offended by Pinochet's arrest, and they don't
want an investigation of the crimes of the past.
 &HT;    But I doubt that they would lift a single rifle in his defense.
The young generals are not comfortable being identified with the
dictatorship; in a world that aspires to global justice, maybe they
feel that it's time to clean up their image.
 &HT;    In Santiago in early December, the atmosphere was tense, but
when it became clear that Pinochet was not returning anytime soon,
there was a sense of relief and the cloud of fear began to lift.
People talked openly in the streets.
 &HT;    On television shows, Pinochet was not called ``senator for
life'' anymore, but ``the former dictator.'' Leftist politicians
and victims of human-rights abuses were on TV daily expressing
their opinions.
 &HT;    But don't get me wrong; fear still reigns in Chile; 17 years of
terror left a mark. My country is traumatized, like an abused child
that is always expecting the next blow.
 &HT;    I feel no hatred for Pinochet. Hatred is a very heavy burden,
one I shook off many years ago, when I started writing. Writing has
allowed me to exorcise most of my demons and transform my pain into
strength. I would like to see him face a trial, so that the truth
about his crimes is fully exposed.
 &HT;    But I don't want the general to rot in prison, as so many of his
victims did. He has already suffered an undeniable defeat that
nothing can turn into victory.
 &HT;    Even without a trial, in the eyes of the world he is an alleged
criminal, and moral censure can be worse than prison. I merely wish
that in the winter of his life the general would ask forgiveness of
all those whose lives he destroyed, the families of the dead and
disappeared, the exiled and tortured; that he would reveal where
the bodies of his victims can be found.

percent of the people don't care about his fate.
 &HT;    The general is still powerful and feared. The military is
exerting pressure, but there is no real danger of a coup.
Certainly, they are offended by Pinochet's arrest, and they don't
want an investigation of the crimes of the past.
 &HT;    But I doubt that they would lift a single rifle in his defense.
The young generals are not comfortable being identified with the
dictatorship; in a world that aspires to global justice, maybe they
feel that it's time to clean up their image.
 &HT;    In Santiago in early December, the atmosphere was tense, but
when it became clear that Pinochet was not returning anytime soon,
there was a sense of relief and the cloud of fear began to lift.
People talked openly in the streets.
 &HT;    On television shows, Pinochet was not called ``senator for
life'' anymore, but ``the former dictator.'' Leftist politicians
and victims of human-rights abuses were on TV daily expressing
their opinions.
 &HT;    But don't get me wrong; fear still reigns in Chile; 17 years of
terror left a mark. My country is traumatized, like an abused child
that is always expecting the next blow.
 &HT;    I feel no hatred for Pinochet. Hatred is a very heavy burden,
one I shook off many years ago, when I started writing. Writing has
allowed me to exorcise most of my demons and transform my pain into
strength. I would like to see him face a trial, so that the truth
about his crimes is fully exposed.
 &HT;    But I don't want the general to rot in prison, as so many of his
victims did. He has already suffered an undeniable defeat that
nothing can turn into victory.
 &HT;    Even without a trial, in the eyes of the world he is an alleged
criminal, and moral censure can be worse than prison. I merely wish
that in the winter of his life the general would ask forgiveness of
all those whose lives he destroyed, the families of the dead and
disappeared, the exiled and tortured; that he would reveal where
the bodies of his victims can be found.

OCKHAM'S RAZOR'S CLOSE SHAVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Jan. 31) 
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Occam's razor is a principle that has served science well,''
wrote Charles Krauthammer in The Weekly Standard, ``for about, oh,
650 years.'' The psychiatrist-turned-columnist, writing about the
Middle East, served his readers well about, oh, immediately, with
this definition: ``It holds that the simplest, most parsimonious
explanation for a phenomenon is likely to be the correct one.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of months before, another conservative pundit, George
Will, argued that the public could understand the rationale behind
the yearlong Clinton defense by its ``intuitive wielding of
` &UR; Ockham's razor &LR; ,' also called the principle of parsimony. The
principle is: When seeking to explain phenomena, start with the
simplest theory.''
</P>
<P>
   Agreement on the meaning, if not the spelling, of Occam/Ockham
is universal. The antonymic figure of speech is ``Rube Goldberg
invention,'' after the cartoonist who drew up the most complex
methods of completing a simple task. But it falls to this column to
answer the question unasked by readers who do not want to appear
unread: Who was Ockham, anyway, and what made him the Gillette of
his day?
</P>
<P>
   William of Ockham, the Franciscan logician known to his fellow
friars as ``doctor invincibilis,'' was born in England in 1280. His
philosophic writing on the character of knowledge _ the
nominalist's difference between the name of a thing and the thing
itself _ made him a father of epistemology and caught the eye of
Pope John XXII, then in Avignon.
</P>
<P>
   The monk further angered the pope by supporting the spiritual
Franciscans' defense of the vow of absolute poverty. And as readers
of Umberto Eco's ``Name of the Rose'' recall, such a challenge to
John XXII led to being labeled a heretic and excommunicated.
</P>
<P>
   Ockham and the mantra attributed to him,  &UR; entia non sunt
multiplicanda pr(OB)ter necessitate &LR; , ``entities should not be
multiplied unnecessarily'' (which is a Rube Goldberg way of saying,
``Simpler is better''), became a favorite of later mathematicians
and physicists. When competing theories came to the same result,
the least complicated was preferred. However, Albert Einstein
observed that this shaving away by the Ockhamists could go too far:
``Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not
simpler.''
</P>
<P>
   But what about the razor? The function of a razor is to cut.
Stephen Hawking, in his 1988 ``A Brief History of Time,'' noted
that ``it seems better to employ the principle known as  &UR; Occam's
Razor &LR;  and cut out all the features of the theory which cannot be
observed.'' The old Franciscan friar (probably bearded; shaving
gear was hard to come by in the abbey) was figuratively cutting out
details.
</P>
<P>
   Why isn't the principle of this patron saint of editing called
Ockham's scissors, or knife, or ice pick? ``Philosophers and
historians are generally puzzled as to why the principle of
parsimony should be called  &UR; Ockham's Razor &LR; ,'' writes a trio of
chemists in Hyle, a philosophy quarterly published by the
University of Karlsruhe, in Germany. ``We suspect that the
association is due to the strength of the razor metaphor. ...
Scholastic and theological arguments were complex; to cut through
them, to reach the remaining core of truth quickly, was desperately
desirable. ... Metaphor reaches right into the soul.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the authors, Dr. Roald Hoffman, a Nobel laureate in
chemistry, helped track down the earliest reference to a razor in
connection with our severely censured nominalist's parsimony pitch.
He steered me to a July 1918 article in Mind, a philosophy journal,
by W.M. Thornburn, in which that logician cited a footnote in a
1746 work of the French philosopher Etienne Bonnot de Condillac.
</P>
<P>
   In what Thornburn called ``a flash of Gallic wit,'' de Condillac
characterized Ockham's principle as the  &UR; Rasoir des Nominaux &LR; ,
``the razor of the Nominalists.'' Almost a century later, in the
1836 lectures by Sir William Hamilton on metaphysics and logic, the
man and the metaphor met: ``We are, therefore, entitled to apply
 &UR; Occam's razor &LR;  to this theory of causality.''
</P>
<P>
   From the barber chair of etymology, unwrapping the hot towel and
splashing a little aftershave on the customer's newly unbewhiskered
cheeks, we can safely say: The principle was Ockham's, but the
metaphoric razor was de Condillac's. I cannot state this startling
discovery more briefly.
</P>
<P>
   HEY, GENTLELADY
</P>
<P>
   ``How about letting Chairman Henry Hyde (and many other
congressmen as well) know,'' writes G. Mackenzie Gordon of
Lakeville, Conn., ``that the correlative of  &UR; gentleman &LR;  is  &UR; lady &LR; ,
not  &UR; gentlelady &LR; ?''
</P>
<P>
   The use of  &UR; gentle &LR;  before  &UR; man &LR;  or  &UR; woman &LR;  has, for some six
centuries, indicated noble birth or, more recently, good manners.
According to Judith Martin, the syndicated ``Miss Manners'':
``There is no such thing as a  &UR; gentlelady &LR; . A lady is referred to
in the third person as `the  &UR; gentlewoman &LR; ' or `the  &UR; lady &LR; .''' (She
notes that when used to address an individual, as in ``Hey,  &UR; lady &LR; ,
watch where you're going,'' the  &UR; lady &LR;  is less-than-respectful
usage.)
</P>
<P>
   Judy _ an ol' pal, so I can call her that _ is, as usual,
correct. The only  &UR; gentle lady &LR;  I can find outside the halls of
Congress is in ``Macbeth,'' when Macduff cries: ``O  &UR; gentle lady &LR; ,/
'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:/ The repetition, in a
woman's ear,/ Would murder as it fell.'' But the two words were not
joined.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean that the word does not exist? Certainly it
exists: It was a favorite salutation of the chairmen Henry Gonzales
and Gerald Solomon. It may not be in dictionaries, and some
feminists may think its courtliness is excessive and therefore
regard it as sexist, but the word is intended to be a mark of
respect and is surely in the spoken language. What you cannot
courteously say, however, is ``Hey,  &UR; gentlelady &LR; , watch where
you're going.''

PENTAGON MAP TRIGGERS RENEWED DEBATE OVER GULF WAR ILLNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATHLEEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When the top brass from the Pentagon's Gulf War
Illnesses Office took their seats to testify before President
Clinton's oversight board in Washington late last year, Paul
Sullivan expected no surprises.
</P>
<P>
   But Sullivan, who heads a group that fights for medical care for
sick veterans, was astonished at what he saw.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly eight years after the war, the Pentagon unveiled a map of
the Gulf War battlefield, giving veterans what they consider the
strongest evidence yet that hundreds of thousands of soldiers may
have been exposed to radioactive and toxic debris.
</P>
<P>
   It showed the sites where Army tanks and Air Force jets fired
more than 300 tons of ``depleted uranium'' ammunition at Iraqi
troops during the four-day ground war in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The map has reignited a debate between veterans and the Defense
Department about how many American soldiers may have inhaled or
ingested depleted uranium, or absorbed it into their bodies through
wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The map shows that almost every combat unit goes through
contaminated areas twice,'' said Sullivan, executive director of
the National Gulf War Resource Center, a coalition of veterans
groups based in Washington. He said soldiers traveled on
contaminated roads and may have camped on contaminated land for up
to two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean soldiers are going to fall ill, but it means
they should be aware this took place,'' Sullivan said. ``They
should be concerned about medical findings that will come out as a
result of new research.''
</P>
<P>
   Veterans and the Pentagon are far apart in their estimates of
exposure to depleted uranium, a radioactive metal prized by the
military for what it calls the ability to blast through armor
``like a hot knife through butter.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans used depleted uranium ammunition in combat for the
first time during the Gulf War, but the soldiers were not warned
that inhaling, ingesting or absorbing it could cause cancer, or
respiratory, kidney and skin disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Warren Rudman, who heads the presidential oversight
board, said the dispute over the numbers will take more study to
resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea if the number was three or 300,000,'' said
Rudman, a Republican from New Hampshire. ``We haven't gotten to the
point where we've made that determination.''
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from veterans groups campaigning for medical
care, the Pentagon several times has increased its estimate:
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1993, the Army said 35 soldiers _ all victims of ``friendly
fire'' _ came in contact.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1995, the Army boosted the number to 50.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1997, the Army said 112 soldiers had been exposed _
friendly fire survivors, soldiers who prepared contaminated U.S.
tanks for shipment home, and soldiers wounded in an explosion at
the Camp Doha military base in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1998, the Pentagon said ``thousands'' may have been
exposed, including soldiers who had climbed on destroyed Iraqi
tanks after the war on battlefield tours. And the Pentagon boosted
its estimate of friendly fire victims to 113.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, the National Gulf War Resource Center said 400,000
soldiers may have come in contact with the hazardous dust and
debris. Using the Pentagon map, the group now estimates that more
than 200,000 soldiers may have been exposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our understanding that a majority of the 338,000 Army
soldiers and 98,000 Marines sent to the Gulf went into Iraq and
Kuwait,'' Sullivan said. ``For us to conclude that only half of
those 436,000 people were exposed to depleted uranium is a
conservative estimate.''
</P>
<P>
   The map represents the first time the Pentagon has released
information on where the ammunition was used, but Sullivan contends
the picture is incomplete, and therefore may underestimate the
number exposed.
</P>
<P>
   The map does not show the 3rd Armored, 82nd Airborne and 101st
Airborne divisions, nor does it list support troops that entered
combat zones, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said it also fails to show where depleted uranium was fired
by British troops, the only other soldiers in the Gulf to use the
ammunition, the Camp Doha explosion, and test-firing ranges in
Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Dian Lawhon, a spokeswoman in the Pentagon's Gulf War
Illnesses Office, acknowledged the map is incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not at all representative of the entire picture by any
stretch of the imagination. We recognize that's a problem with this
map,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the Pentagon does not plan to release a comprehensive
version of the map, which was created for the two-day public
hearing of Clinton's oversight board.
</P>
<P>
   Lawhon said thousands of soldiers may have been exposed to
depleted uranium in the Gulf War, but few received doses that could
be considered harmful.
</P>
<P>
   Lawhon said uranium is part of the natural environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The human body is accustomed to having uranium in it,'' she
said. ``We process uranium through our body all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a 1995 report to Congress, the Army Environmental Policy
Institute said depleted uranium has the potential to generate
``significant medical consequences'' if it enters the body.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Radiation specialist Rosalie Bertell said most trace metals
perform a function in the human body, but not uranium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use iron. We use zinc. But uranium is purely a
contaminant,'' said Bertell, president of the International
Institute of Concern for Public Health, a Canadian research center.
``The Pentagon uses the word `natural' as if everything natural is
harmless. Arsenic is natural and it's not harmless.''
</P>
<P>
   Bertell said the metal ``aerosolizes'' when it explodes,
creating a fine mist of radioactive particles that can be picked up
by the wind and travel for miles. Soldiers and tanks kicking up
dust as they move through an area can resuspend particles that had
fallen to the ground, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the Army said as much as 70 percent of a depleted
uranium penetrator _ the ammunition's solid metal core _ can be
turned into fine particle when it strikes a tank.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Pentagon failed to conduct medical screenings of
soldiers exposed after the war, as required by Army regulations, no
one knows the doses they received.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon map showed the sites where Americans fired the
ammunition at Iraqi tanks, armored personnel carriers and bunkers.
</P>
<P>
   It illustrates where 150 Air Force attack jets shot depleted
uranium ammunition at Iraqi armor and artillery positions, the
paths U.S. troops took as they plowed through the potentially
contaminated parts of the desert in pursuit of enemy targets, and
where the Pentagon said 1,955 Abrams tanks fired ``significant
quantities'' of the ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pentagon has had this information since 1991,'' Sullivan
said. ``It could have been used much earlier by veterans who are
sick and the doctors who are looking into their illnesses.''

AN AGGRESSIVE PUSH TO SAVE FAILING HEARTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Minn., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only about 5 percent of the 5 million Americans suffering from
heart failure are receiving the most effective therapy, a panel of
150 cardiologists says, and this is resulting in what they estimate
are 100,000 more deaths annually than would otherwise occur.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, a not-for-profit organization called the Advisory
Council to Improve Outcomes Nationwide in Heart Failure, published
new treatment recommendations in the current issue of the American
Journal of Cardiology to try to bring more physicians up to date on
the latest research and to encourage them to become more aggressive
in applying the new findings.
</P>
<P>
   The report stated that the guidelines resulted from three years
of clinical studies establishing that, as a general rule, four
medications _ digitalis, diuretics, ACE inhibitors and beta
blockers _ should be used in concert in treating heart failure.
Beta blockers and ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors
block the effect on the heart of hormones that cause the body
stress; digitalis stimulates the heart and diuretics remove excess
fluid from the body.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to its name, the medical term ``heart failure'' does
not mean that the heart has stopped; rather, it refers to heart
disease that can develop progressively, for example, from
chronically high blood pressure or that can develop after a heart
attack damages heart muscles.
</P>
<P>
   The number of deaths this condition causes or contributes to in
the United States has doubled since 1979, reaching 250,000 deaths a
year, along with 3.5 million hospitalizations. And 400,000 to
700,000 new cases are being diagnosed annually. This is occurring
as advances in other areas of cardiology have enabled more patients
to survive heart attacks but leave them with damaged hearts caused
by the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients with heart failure have greater disability and are
hospitalized more frequently than patients with all forms of cancer
combined,'' said Dr. Jay N. Cohn, who heads a heart failure center
at the University of Minnesota and is a co-chairman of the advisory
council. But he said it has become clear that ``we can potentially
slow the progression of this disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Milton Packer, who heads a heart-failure center at Columbia
Presbyterian Medical Center in New York and is co-chairman of the
advisory council, said surveys showed that 80 percent of American
heart-failure patients received digitalis and diuretics, but only
40 percent received ACE inhibitors and fewer than 5 percent, beta
blockers.
</P>
<P>
   If all four drugs were used together, he said, the studies
showed that the number of deaths could be cut by 100,000 a year and
the number of hospital admissions by one million.
</P>
<P>
   Packer cautioned that the regimen should be avoided in some
cases, including those in which the heart does not enlarge as
expected after a heart attack to compensate for damaged muscle. The
regimen should also be abandoned when a patient cannot tolerate the
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional drugs _ digitalis and diuretics _ sometimes seem
effective by themselves and make the patient feel better, leading
some doctors to limit the regimen, the cardiology panel said. But
this result, they added, is only temporary.
</P>
<P>
   Preparation of the guidelines was financed by grants from 12
pharmaceutical companies but the companies played no role in
developing or defining them, the panel said.

WANTING TO REVIVE A MORE CIVIL AMERICA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans today are yearning for a revival of bipartisanship.
They're saying they want their elected leaders to put away the
daggers of political combat, stop tying to destroy one another, and
concentrate together on the nation's problems.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, as I watched the State of the Union message, my mind
journeyed back to an earlier time. The year was 1955, my first
occasion to witness personally the pageantry of this event. Dwight
D. Eisenhower was president.
</P>
<P>
   At the doorkeeper's announcement of the president's arrival, an
explosion of applause burst upon the chamber. Suddenly every member
was standing. All were cheering. It would have been impossible that
day to distinguish between the parties. Democrats and Republicans
alike stood smiling, applauding vigorously, their voices rising in
boisterous welcome. Waves of applause continued for what seemed a
long while as Ike stood, waving and grinning, behind the lectern.
</P>
<P>
   His first words were to note that it was the birthday, the 72nd,
of Speaker Sam Rayburn. Smiling broadly, Eisenhower offered Rayburn
his hand, wishing many happy returns. Now, again, the audience was
standing, cheering, shouting out its acclaim to the venerable
speaker _ Democratic and Republican members alike! One ovation
matched the other.
</P>
<P>
   Often have I recalled that spectacle. Here were two men who
represented the rival political parties that led our two sometimes
juxtaposed branches of government. Whatever their differences, it
was clear that they respected one another professionally and liked
one another personally. Neither wanted the other embarrassed. Each
would defend the other's honor.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering the majesty of that moment, and of others like it
that followed in those years, I think I know part of what it is,
that indefinable spirit that America's citizens want to see
restored.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't a matter of passive agreement on policy details. We
often disagreed. It wasn't blindness to one another's faults. We
knew some and weren't interested.
</P>
<P>
   With exceptions so rare that they became objects of opprobrium,
nobody wanted to inflict personal injury upon a political
adversary. We were not, after all, enemies. We all worked for the
same country. We were allies in that overriding sense.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Tom Brokaw's new book, ``The Greatest Generation,'' has
part of the answer. Members of that generation then beginning to
assume national power had survived a depression together and fought
a war together. We had lived together. Trained together. Sacrificed
together. Depended for our very lives on one another, Democrats and
Republicans though we _ oh, so incidentally _ were.
</P>
<P>
   But this can't be the whole answer. It would be self-defeating
to conclude that people cannot be civil to one another unless
they've experienced the bloody incivilities of war. Or that only
those who've personally suffered want and privation can be grateful
for abundance or act compassionately toward people in need. To
believe either proposition would make a mockery of the principal
strivings of my generation. For we wanted to leave our progeny a
legacy of peace and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly simple traits of courtesy, cooperativeness and
forbearance surely must be more than generational. Admittedly,
they're learned arts, environmentally inculcated. Behavior habits,
we're told, result from and mimic observed behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Kids today spend less time learning from parental example, more
from television. Still, it's too glib to blame anti-social behavior
in high office simply on media excesses. Nor do I think the decline
in civility and the rise in negativism are irreversible.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenhower and Jimmy Carter were probably the two least partisan
presidents of the past half-century. In Ike's case, Democratic
congressional leaders like Rayburn and Lyndon B. Johnson went out
of their way to cooperate with him. Repeatedly, they saved the
president's foreign initiatives. And Ike never tried to repeal the
New Deal.
</P>
<P>
   There were other prime examples of nonpartisanship down through
the years. Rayburn would never tolerate disparagement of House
Minority Leader Joe Martin. When Vice President Spiro Agnew's
resignation vacated the No. 2 spot, Speaker Carl Albert acted
swiftly to fill it with then-House Minority Leader Gerald Ford.
Albert thought it inappropriate for him, a Democrat, to stay next
in line in case something should happen to Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout my years, I enjoyed close working friendships with
numerous Republican leaders, including Ford, John Rhodes, Bob
Michel and Vice President Nelson Rockefeller. Democratic Speaker
Tip O'Neill and President Reagan were poles apart ideologically but
got along remarkably well on the personal level. Tip never failed
to accommodate a Reagan request for scheduling of any matter that
the president considered important to his program.
</P>
<P>
   That was before the politics of personal destruction began to
take its mean-spirited toll. For every reputation sullied by
slander lie three counterplots to wreak vengeance. Is there an end
to it? After the senators vote on the impeachment charges insisted
upon last month in the harshly partisan House vote, can the
president and this Congress _ still barely dominated by his
political opposition _ make peace? Can they work together long
enough to fix health care and salvage Social Security?
</P>
<P>
   The political age of big money and low voter turnouts augurs
against it. Candidates have formed habits of catering to the
haters, the most extreme elements in each party. Those are the
people who contribute _ and vote.
</P>

   Yet there's a growing swell of sentiment among ordinary people
who promise that they're not going to forget. They aren't your
classic haters, and most of them don't have huge bankrolls. But
they remember what America was, and they want it back.

<P>
   In the past year, a handful of Washington business lobbyists
have waged a blistering campaign to persuade the world that
Congress has been engaged in a spasm of sanctions proliferation.
Reliance on unilateral sanctions, these lobbyists warn us, is a
disturbing new epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Their campaign has sparked dozens of news articles and
editorials decrying the ``sanctions frenzy'' and castigating
Congress' ``voracious appetite'' for sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Normally responsible journalists parrot statistics _
conveniently furnished by these business lobbyists _ alleging that
in the last few years the United States has placed anywhere from
one-half to two-thirds of the world's population under the yoke of
economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Even President Clinton jumped on the antisanctions bandwagon,
announcing in 1998 that the United States has gone ``sanctions
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   This is sheer nonsense. The statistics peddled by the lobbyists
are grossly inflated and intentionally misleading. Half of the
world is not living under American sanctions _ nowhere near it.
There is no epidemic. Congress has been cautious and circumspect,
passing just a handful of carefully targeted sanctions laws. And
unilateral economic sanctions are by no means new. They have been
vital weapons in America's foreign-policy arsenal for more than 200
years.
</P>
<P>
   I have been and continue to be a friend of American business.
But the distortions spread by this small cabal of lobbyists in the
name of American business are inexcusable.
</P>
<P>
   One statistic is by now conventional wisdom: In just four years
the United States has imposed sanctions 61 times, burdening 2.3
billion people (42 percent of the world). That would be pretty
awful, save for one thing _ it is not true. These figures have been
circulated by the anti-sanctions business group USA Engage, based
on a study by the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM). They
are a fabrication.
</P>
<P>
   At my request, the Congressional Research Service (CRS)
evaluated the NAM claim that from 1993 through 1996, ``61 U.S. laws
and executive actions were enacted authorizing unilateral sanctions
for foreign policy purposes.'' CRS reported that it ``could not
defensibly'' justify the number.
</P>
<P>
   How did NAM come up with 61 sanctions? The study alleges that 20
laws were passed by Congress and 41 were imposed by presidential
action. This is a gross distortion. Nearly three-quarters of the
congressional measures were not sanctions at all but conditions,
limitations or restrictions on U.S. foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   One measure placed conditions on assistance to the Palestine
Liberation Organization. Another barred aid for military or police
training to Haitians involved in drug trafficking or human-rights
abuses. One ``sanction'' blocked assistance to countries knowingly
harboring fugitives wanted by the international war-crimes
tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. Still another
prohibited Defense Department aid to countries supporting
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Are these the measures that NAM and USA Engage want Congress to
curtail? Let's hope not.
</P>
<P>
   But what about those 41 ``sanctions'' imposed by the executive
branch? Five are not unilateral, as NAM charges, but rather
represent U.S. compliance with U.N. Security Council sanctions _
multilateral, by definition. In seven cases, the NAM study counts
the same sanction repeatedly, identifying it each time as a
separate sanction.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the measure declaring Sudan a terrorist state is
counted five times. NAM lists two cases when no sanction was ever
imposed, including a November 1994 executive order that even NAM
concedes in fine print ``did not impose any specific new sanctions
on any countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight cases represent mere restrictions on U.S. foreign aid.
Five are limited bans affecting only military exports to Zaire,
Nigeria, Sudan, Haiti and Angola. Thirteen affect only a specific
foreign company or person _ not an entire country, not an entire
industry, but one specific entity _ for example, banning imports
from the Chinese Qinghai Hide and Garment Factory for its use of
prison slave labor or seizing the assets of individual Colombian
drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   These actions are obviously not what most people think of as
``sanctions.'' They think of broad trade bans affecting whole
countries, entire industries, vast populations or access to large
markets _ not of blocking imports from a single prison factory in
China, seizing the assets of drug barons or halting the sale of
lethal weapons to terrorist states.
</P>
<P>
   The claim that 42 percent of the world's population has been
affected is also bogus. The study lists the entire population of
the former Zaire (now the Congo) as being under U.S. sanction
because the United States barred sales of defense items to the
government. The same goes for China, Nigeria, Mauritania and
Pakistan, where CRS notes that such highly targeted actions ``put
the entire populations of these countries into NAM's calculation,
even though most people ... are not likely to experience
significant impact from or awareness of (the) imposition.''
</P>
<P>
   What is the reality? Between 1993 and 1996, Congress passed and
the president signed a total of five new sanctions laws: the
Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994, the Cuban Liberty and
Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996, the Antiterrorism and Effective
Death Penalty Act of 1996, the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act of 1996 and
the Free Burma Act of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   During the same period, the president imposed just four new
sanctions: declaring Sudan a terrorist state; banning imports of
munitions and ammunition from China; tightening travel-related
restrictions, cash remittance levels and the sending of gift
parcels to Cuba (restrictions that have since been lifted); and
imposing a ban on new contractual agreements or investment in Iran.
Nine new sanctions. That is it.
</P>
<P>
   The allegation of a sanctions epidemic is demonstrably false _ a
myth spread with the intention of misleading Congress, the American
public and the American business community.
</P>
<P>
   What the lobbyists dislike is not the idea of sanctions but the
reason some sanctions are imposed. They tacitly admit that
sanctions work but insist that sanctions are good only if they
defend business interests, not national interests.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lobbyists, the United States should be
hamstrung when a government proliferates weapons of mass
destruction, commits genocide, tortures its people or supports
terrorists. But if that same government floods the American market
with cheap TV sets, America should throw the book at it.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, the business lobbyists cannot say that, so they
attempt to confuse the issue with cooked-up data and claims of an
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions have always been an American foreign-policy weapon.
Economic sanctions were imposed by the American colonies against
Britain in response to the Stamp and Townsend Acts, in both cases
forcing their repeal. Jefferson and Madison both passionately
advocated economic sanctions, believing not only that they were
legitimate but that they should be America's primary diplomatic
tools.
</P>
<P>
   There are three tools in foreign policy: diplomacy, sanctions
and war. Take away sanctions and how can the United States deal
with terrorists, proliferators and genocidal dictators? Our options
would be empty talk or sending in the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   Without sanctions, the United States would be virtually
powerless to influence events absent war. Sanctions may not be
perfect and they are not always the answer, but they are often the
only weapon.
</P>
<P>
   There should be sanctions on companies and governments that
proliferate nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and countries
that murder women and children and pile them into mass graves.
America should not hesitate for one second to place a cost on these
reprehensible acts and to restrain those few American companies who
would actually conduct business with the perpetrators of such
heinous crimes.
</P>
<P>
   With their antisanctions crusade, the lobbyists are fighting for
business as usual with thugs, tyrants and terrorists. They do not
represent the views of the American people or most American
businesses. They should be ashamed.

POPE SEEKS TO AVERT A `PROTESTANTIZED' CATHOLIC CHURCH

Times Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative DEBRA

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    During his visit to Mexico and the United States, Pope John Paul
II has expressed his hope to unite the Americas into a single
Catholic church called the ``Synod of America.''
 &HT;    American Catholic unification would solve several Catholic
problems. It could provide for more effective evangelization,
create economic solidarity between the rich and the poor, and
establish religious continuity for Catholics who immigrate to the
North.
 &HT;    Additionally, the pope may hope that the South's Catholic
traditionalism might dilute North American liberalism -- and thus
provide a stricter Catholic counterbalance to secular, post-modern
culture. A more traditional, unified church could combat the sexual
and political movements Rome finds objectionable.
 &HT;    Although the issues facing Roman Catholicism in the Americas
seem completely contemporary, they are entwined with one of Rome's
oldest problems: Protestantism.
 &HT;    In the Americas, as they had in Europe, Catholics and
Protestants handled their differences by separating one from
another. The United States and Canada were Protestant nations with
Catholic minorities left to fend for themselves with recourse to
the law. The rest of the hemisphere was Catholic with Protestant
minorities. The principle formulated in 1648 as a result of the
Thirty Years War in Europe, ``whose territory, whose religion,''
held sway in American religious politics as well.
 &HT;    In North and South America, Catholic and Protestant relations
existed as they had historically. They were bad. For the most part,
Catholics and Protestants had stopped killing one another. But
prejudice, tension and misunderstanding still existed between the
two.
 &HT;    During the 1960s, Vatican II encouraged Catholics to bridge the
gap between themselves and their neighbors. Catholics launched
ecumenical discussions on a world-wide basis. By mid-century,
Catholicism in predominately Protestant countries came to be
perceived as not hostile foreigner but full citizens.
 &HT;    A similar dynamic occurred south of the border. Historically
Catholic countries loosened strictures against proselytization.
Thousands of Protestant missionaries -- mostly fundamentalists and
Pentecostals -- poured into Latin and South America, successfully
converting millions of Catholics to their faith.
 &HT;    In the last fifty years, Americans have witnessed the greatest
religious intermixing between Protestants and Catholics in their
hemispheric history. Catholic ecumenism and immigration created a
greater Catholic presence in the North; Protestant missions
exponentially increased Protestant minorities in the South.
 &HT;    While this shift created greater freedom and inter-faith
cooperation for all Americans, it has also fanned the ancient
flames of Catholic-Protestant tension. And that shift appears to be
the impetus behind the pope's call for a unified church.
 &HT;    For Protestants, the changes have been mostly positive. As the
hemisphere's minority, ecumenism and evangelism strengthened
Protestant presence in every country. In just the last decade,
Protestantism has grown by 40 percent in Mexico alone. In addition,
innumerable Catholic immigrants to the United States have broken
with Catholicism and converted to Protestantism.
 &HT;    Thus, while Catholicism gained acceptance, Protestantism gained
adherents. The demographics worry Rome. If current conversion rates
continue, some parts of Latin America may boast Protestant
majorities. Not since the Reformation has Rome faced such
large-scale defections to Protestantism.
 &HT;    Unifying the church directly counters the Protestant challenge
by repositioning and strengthening Catholicism. It also undercuts
ecumenical achievements and inter-faith understanding and could
intensifies regional religious competition.
 &HT;    Rome may not, however, have much choice. Losing people means
losing power, influence and money. Even if Protestantism fails to
win numerical majorities, its influence on Latin America is already
being felt through movements for democracy and social equality. For
Rome, this is more than dwindling church attendance. The future of
Catholic Christendom hangs in the balance.
 &HT;    Rome has always looked warily toward the United States. For
here, as nowhere else, one possible Catholic future exists: Roman
Catholicism is one religion among many in a culture defined by
Protestant individualism and religious pluralism. Although
Protestantism may be the region's numerical minority, its ethos
shapes all of the Americas.
 &HT;    Many U.S. Catholics have adjusted to this by elevating
individual conscience and ignoring church authorities. North
American Catholics are ``good'' Catholics by resembling ``good''
Protestants -- mostly through personal virtue and church
attendance. Obedience to Catholic dogma has little to do with it.
In the Americas, religious intermixing has created Protestantized
Catholicism. And that is what the Vatican dreads.
 &HT;    If Latin and South American Catholicism embrace this highly
Protestantized form -- as they threaten to do -- Roman Catholicism
cannot survive as it does presently. With Protestantization comes
anti-hierarchicalism, ideals of personal liberties (including
sexual ones), and theological libertarianism -- hardly John Paul's
vision for Christianity's next millennium.
 &HT;    Depending on one's view, this is either the most exciting or the
most deeply troubling moment in Roman Catholic history. John Paul
II appears to believe it the latter. Those of us in the United
States see things differently.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    During his visit to Mexico and the United States, Pope John Paul
II has expressed his hope to unite the Americas into a single
Catholic church called the ``Synod of America.''
 &HT;    American Catholic unification would solve several Catholic
problems. It could provide for more effective evangelization,
create economic solidarity between the rich and the poor, and
establish religious continuity for Catholics who immigrate to the
North.
 &HT;    Additionally, the pope may hope that the South's Catholic
traditionalism might dilute North American liberalism -- and thus
provide a stricter Catholic counterbalance to secular, post-modern
culture. A more traditional, unified church could combat the sexual
and political movements Rome finds objectionable.
 &HT;    Although the issues facing Roman Catholicism in the Americas
seem completely contemporary, they are entwined with one of Rome's
oldest problems: Protestantism.
 &HT;    In the Americas, as they had in Europe, Catholics and
Protestants handled their differences by separating one from
another. The United States and Canada were Protestant nations with
Catholic minorities left to fend for themselves with recourse to
the law. The rest of the hemisphere was Catholic with Protestant
minorities. The principle formulated in 1648 as a result of the
Thirty Years War in Europe, ``whose territory, whose religion,''
held sway in American religious politics as well.

WHEN SPATS SEND THE BLOOD PRESSURE SOARING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Utah)   (af)  
 By JOHN O'NEIL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arguing with a spouse seems a sure-fire way of raising the blood
pressure _ unless, a University of Utah study has found, one
partner wins or loses all the arguments in the household.
</P>
<P>
   People in the study who had identified their spouses as clearly
more dominant or submissive got less worked up over
staged-in-the-laboratory disagreements than did people who felt
smaller power gaps in their marriages.
</P>
<P>
   The ins and outs of marriage were not really the point of the
study, whose results were published Tuesday in the Annals of
Behavioral Medicine. The goal was to learn more about heart
disease, said Timothy W. Smith, the professor who led the research.
</P>
<P>
   Large-scale epidemiological studies have established that stress
in a relationship is a risk factor for heart disease, and research
has established cardiovascular response _ the sudden surge of heart
activity that accompanies anger or stress _ as the likely mechanism
for that link.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has conducted a series of experiments using marital
interactions as a crucible for finding the kinds of interactions
that make the heart pound in that unhealthy way.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the psychology professor's earlier studies looked at
spousal interactions along an axis of hostility to friendliness.
But the atmosphere at the breakfast table is also shaped by
patterns of relative dominance.
</P>
<P>
   To study their effect on heart response, the researchers
gathered 45 couples in their late 20s who had been married an
average of four years.
</P>
<P>
   First, the partipants were given questionnaires designed to
quantify perceptions of the relative power of their partners. Then,
with blood pressure cuffs attached, spouses were pitted against
each other in staged arguments, advocating opposing points of view
in hypothetical struggles over what departments would suffer in
school budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
   People who saw their spouses as relatively equal or only
somewhat dominant or submissive would see persuasion as difficult;
the effort would push up their blood pressure. At the high or low
end, however, the slim likelihood of victory or loss would leave
little need for effort.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers then tried to see if the curve changed if the
stakes were higher: Some subjects were told that the researchers
would give one person out of the entire group $100, but that their
chances in the lottery would be based on their success in changing
a spouse's point of view.
</P>
<P>
   This ``incentive manipulation'' had little effect on women. But
for men, it sent blood pressures up for henpecked and patriarch
alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``For men, if you had a reason to win the argument, that was all
that mattered,'' said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Although one conceivable reading of the results could be that
marriages among equals were the most likely to send blood pressure
soaring, Smith said, ``There are other things about a marriage
between equals that would reduce stress. Arguing may be difficult,
but the fact that they see the other as open to discussion makes it
less likely that there will be the sorts of long-term resentments
that are clearly more stressful.''

AN EVIL FAR FROM CONQUERED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE TRIUMPH OF EVIL 
Produced by: Mike Robinson 
Date: Tuesday at 9 p.m., PBS
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A year after President Clinton dedicated the new Holocaust
Museum in Washington, saying ``so must we remain (evil's) adversary
in the world,'' the world watched passively as genocide bloodied
Rwanda, claiming the lives of perhaps 1 million Tutsis, one-seventh
of the country's population. The new PBS ``Frontline,'' ``The
Triumph of Evil,'' dramatically contrasts Clinton's platitudes, and
a view of the serene Potomac, with footage of Hutus methodically
dismembering their victims, some of whom were still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Quite intentionally, ``The Triumph of Evil,'' airing Tuesday at
9 P.M. on PBS, is a sick-making horror story in more ways than one.
Its few repulsive evocations of the 1994 bloodletting are, of
course, deeply troubling. But perhaps even more disturbing is the
methodically reported, clearly developed argument that the United
States, some European allies, and the United Nations coldly, and
cynically, stood by even as they secretly acknowledged the
existence of a massive genocide.
</P>
<P>
   The overarching, breathtaking crux of the film, in the stark
words of writer Philip Gourevitch, is ``that anybody who believes
the words `never again' is deluding themselves dangerously'' about
future holocausts.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of US and UN double talk, evasion, and hypocrisy the
hourlong film exposes is staggering and altogether credible. For
example, through an informant, the United Nations was alerted to
the plans for the genocide before the Hutus began hunting Tutsis
like prey _ cheered on by Rwandan national radio, which also
reported the whereabouts of fearful, fleeing Tutsis. The United
Nations not only avoided acting as the killing began, but dodged
calling the massacres genocide so it would not be obliged to act
later.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous terrified Tutsis who took refuge with UN Assistance
Mission for Rwanda soldiers begged to be shot by them rather than
abandoned to Hutu machetes. The UN peacekeepers left them to the
blades.
</P>
<P>
   The United States didn't merely duck the Rwandan horrors. It
consciously wrote the country off as a matter of foreign policy,
according to ``The Triumph of Evil.'' James Woods, former assistant
secretary for the Department of Defense, witnessed the birth of the
policy. After he had placed Rwanda on a list of potential crisis
areas early in the first Clinton administration, he says, it was
soon removed. ``US national interest is not involved and . . . we
can't put all these silly humanitarian issues on lists,'' Woods
says he was told. Later, our government, like the UN, played
awkward semantic games for the media, trimming the truth about
genocide in order not to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   Producer Mike Robinson shapes damning on-the-record testimony by
credible, articulate, and forthcoming American, European, and
African sources into a film that is both powerful indictment and
fearful warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Triumph of Evil'' isn't easy to watch, and not just
because of its stomach-churning long shots of mass killing and
foreboding message. The film's persuasively detailed argument is
woven mainly from the words of the talking heads who dominate the
documentary.
</P>
<P>
   However revealing, shocking, or heartfelt, they demand
unflagging attention to be fully appreciated. It's hard to imagine
that if large audiences viewed reports like this, changes in policy
wouldn't eventually follow.

HOLLYWOOD HAS FUN WITH THE GOLDEN GLOBES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What were they thinking? It's hard to get inside the heads of
the folks who designed the stage for Sunday night's 56th annual
Golden Globe awards ceremony. From the giant lemon and watermelon
slices swooping around the presenters and winners to the peach and
then blue crepe-like backdrop, it was all very ``Laugh-In.'' And
very plastered with sparkles, too, like so many of the young
actresses who, as Joan Rivers noted in the E! channel's preshow,
opted to complement their designer gowns with glittery ``fairy
dust'' sprinkled on their chests and faces.
</P>
<P>
   But then, the Golden Globes isn't meant to be a terribly serious
event, in the manner of biggies like the Oscars. In the past four
years, the Golden Globe has worked to distinguish itself from the
zillion other TV awards shows by emphasizing whimsicality and
emotion. Chosen by the little-known Hollywood Foreign Press
Association, the winners are less memorable than the party
atmosphere, as the stars are plied with food and drink before they
hit the stage and open their mouths. Christine Lahti has become the
poster girl for the Golden Globe spirit, as last year she was in
the loo when her name was called. Allusions to that classic moment
included Lahti onstage with toilet paper on her shoe and Dick Clark
leading us on _ no kidding _ a tour of the ladies room.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night's Globes show was as easy an awards show as ever,
its three hours seeming to pass in half as much psychic time as the
Oscars or Emmys. Jim Carrey goofed on himself when accepting the
best dramatic actor for ``The Truman Show,'' noting, ``It's going
to be so hard to talk out of my (butt) after this'' and then
jokingly thanking the Academy. Michael Caine accepted his award for
best comedy actor for ``Little Voice'' saying, ``My career must be
slipping. This is the first time I've been available to pick up an
award.'' Michael J. Fox, who recently revealed he has Parkinson's
disease, gave a heartfelt acceptance speech when he won the best
comedy actor award for ``Spin City,'' thanking the doctor ``who
actually opened my brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwyneth Paltrow was joyful as she accepted her award for best
comedy actress for ``Shakespeare in Love,'' delivering very
emotional thank yous to a long list that included ``my good friend
Ben Affleck,'' the much gossiped-about former beau who was seated
next to her. Jack Nicholson collected his Cecil B. DeMille Award
with smirky good cheer and a very long speech, praising the Golden
Globe over the Oscar because ``it doesn't come from our peer
group'' and because ``you almost feel like you could go out and
have fun with'' the Hollywood Foreign Press. As Nicholson came to
the stage, ``Born to Be Wild,'' from his early ``Easy Rider,''
blared throughout the ballroom and the audience clapped along. The
lucky winners for best picture were ``Saving Private Ryan,'' for
drama, and ``Shakespeare in Love,'' for comedy. The Globes often
presage the Oscars, with 12 best movies going on to win Oscars in
the past 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Globes telecast also pairs TV with film, making for
sometimes surreal juxtapositions. David E. Kelley was the man of
the night in the small-screen department, winning Globes for his
``Ally McBeal,'' which won best comedy series, and ``The
Practice,'' which won best drama series. Accepting his ``Ally
McBeal'' statue after Steven Spielberg took his for directing
``Saving Private Ryan,'' Kelley reminded the audience that he is
attempting nothing as important as ``Ryan.'' Leading actor Dylan
McDermott and supporting actress Camryn Manheim also won for ``The
Practice,'' with a vibrant Manheim making one of the lighthearted
night's only references to the news as she offered to share her
award with ``every senator who votes to dismiss the case
tomorrow.''

<P>
   This is the season to be miserable. Every other person seems to
be down with something. But what?
</P>
<P>
   Is it ``just a cold'' or are you suffering from something more
serious like the flu, bronchitis, sinusitis or perhaps pneumonia?
Or could it be an allergy? Knowing what you have can make a big
difference in how you feel, the treatment you require and your
chances for relapse and lingering fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   There is an understandable resistance about consulting a doctor
for what you think is a cold or other seemingly minor infection,
especially if you're still able to muddle through your day. And
there is even greater resistance about taking antibiotics, which
are widely abused and overused. But sometimes such treatment is
necessary, and the sooner it is started, the faster the recovery
and the fewer the complications.
</P>
<P>
   The wise reader will save this column, since the information is
bound to come in handy, if not for you then for a relative or
friend.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best ways to distinguish between a cold and the flu
is by how the illness began. If it crept up on you, starting
perhaps with a scratchy throat, sniffles or sneezes, and gradually
progressed into a runny or stuffy nose, a sore throat and/or cough,
in all likelihood you have a cold _ an upper respiratory infection
with one of the 200 viral strains known to cause the common cold.
</P>
<P>
   You may feel a little chilled and achy and possibly run a
low-grade fever (no more than 100 degrees for adults and 102 for
infants and young children), but the aches will not be severe
enough to keep you from going about your business, though you might
prefer to go to bed.
</P>
<P>
   Most colds resolve without treatment within a week to 10 days.
Longer than that, and chances are you've developed a complication,
a bacterial infection like sinusitis or bronchitis that warrants
medical consultation and, usually, a prescription for antibiotics
to shake the symptoms and malaise.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the flu comes on suddenly and leaves you
feeling exhausted. Fevers tend to run high _ 102 to 104 _ and
you're likely to ache all over, in muscles you didn't even know you
had. Add in extreme fatigue and weakness and you may not be able to
do anything but lie in bed and sleep. Working or playing with the
flu is usually very difficult, even for those of strong will and
stamina.
</P>
<P>
   The upper respiratory symptoms that are the hallmark of colds _
runny or stuffy nose and sneezing _ only sometimes occur with
influenza. And while the sore throat of a cold usually disappears
in a day or two, the sore throat that accompanies the flu usually
worsens by the second or third day. Also, with the flu, the lower
respiratory tract is commonly attacked by the culprit virus,
leaving the bronchial tubes wracked with a hacking cough.
</P>
<P>
   The flu can also hit below the belt, causing vomiting and
diarrhea, especially in children and young adults. This never
happens with a cold. When flu attacks the digestive tract, it may
be impossible for days to keep down anything that is more
nourishing than water or tea. (This symptom is not to be confused
with what is loosely called ``intestinal flu,'' which is not a form
of influenza at all and has none of the achiness and respiratory
symptoms.)
</P>
<P>
   The flu is likely to disappear as abruptly as it started,
usually within three to seven days, though it often leaves a legacy
of fatigue and depression that can last for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague's problem started with a cold that just didn't quit,
leaving her very tired and understandably dispirited for weeks. Her
doctor thought she had chronic fatigue syndrome and suggested
Prozac to lift her spirits. Finding neither conclusion acceptable,
she consulted another doctor who properly diagnosed a sinus
infection and prescribed an antibiotic that restored her vitality
in two days.
</P>
<P>
   More often than most people realize, colds that linger are no
longer colds but have evolved into bacterial infections of the
ears, sinuses or bronchial tubes. These infections gain a foothold
when the cold symptoms weaken defenses and impair drainage in the
respiratory tract.
</P>
<P>
   When a cold lasts for weeks, when the nasal discharge becomes
thick and yellow or greenish and a headache or painful pressure
develops in the face, cheeks, upper teeth or around the eyes,
chances are you've got a sinus infection. Though these infections
sometimes resolve with simple home remedies like hot compresses, an
antibiotic is often needed. When the infection hits the ear, the
intense pain and sense of fullness in the ear is unmistakable; here
again, an antibiotic is likely to be prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   A cold and, more commonly, the flu can also develop into
bronchitis or even pneumonia. When a deep, tight or productive
cough (i.e., one that brings up thick mucus) accompanies or follows
a viral infection, think bronchitis. You might try self-treatment
with an expectorant and gallons of fluids, but chances are you'll
need an antibiotic to wipe out the infection if bacteria are the
cause.
</P>
<P>
   Strep throat can be another source of confusion. Like a cold, it
often begins with a sore throat and fever, but the throat quickly
becomes so sore and swollen that swallowing water can be a problem.
Fevers, too, tend to run high. If a throat culture confirms a
streptococcal infection, 10 days of antibiotics are needed to
eradicate the bacteria and prevent them from infecting the heart
valves (rheumatic fever) or kidneys (glomerulonephritis) and
causing permanent organ damage.
</P>
<P>
   Don't assume that because it is winter and few pollen-producing
plants are in bloom you cannot be suffering from a nasal allergy.
Winter has its share of respiratory allergens _ dust mites galore
(especially when the heat is on), mold spores (do you burn wood in
a fireplace?) and pets (their saliva harbors the allergen) are the
leading candidates. Symptoms may be aggravated by scented candles,
smoke, even cooking fumes.
</P>
<P>
   There are several ways to recognize an allergy. Fever and that
overall sick feeling are rarely present, although fatigue is not
uncommon. With an allergy, your nose may run, your head feel stuffy
and your eyes and throat itchy. Sneezing and a tickly cough are
also common symptoms. Symptoms persist for as long as you're
exposed to the allergen, and return with each subsequent exposure.

SURVEY SHOWS FEW GAYS HOLD ELECTIVE OFFICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL NESS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There are 150 openly gay and lesbian politicians
among more than 455,000 people holding elective office in the
United States, according to a study.
</P>
<P>
   ``One could ask, why so few? But the question could also be, why
so many? Especially given the large percentage of the voting public
who hold deep anti-gay sentiments,'' said Ken Yeager, a gay man who
is a member of the San Jose/Evergreen Community College Board and
has just completed a survey of gay elected officials in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Yeager surveyed the 124 gay men and lesbians who held office in
1997 and, based on responses from 94 of them (76 percent), found
they are vastly more liberal than the general public, their
straight colleagues and other gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds are men, 93 percent are Democrats, 93 percent are
white and most are baby boomers who were elected since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Of the total, 64 percent hold city or county offices or
judgeships, 16 percent are on school or college boards, 18 percent
serve at the state level and two are in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   A key finding contradicts a stereotype Yeager believes the
public holds about gay candidates: that they are interested only in
the issue of gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   Development and infrastructure issues, as well as education,
topped the list of their legislative priorities. Non-discrimination
issues placed third, in a virtual tie with housing and neighborhood
concerns and health. Tax reform and public safety rounded out the
list.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is apparent from these responses that gay and lesbian
officeholders are concerned about quality-of-life issues and
education. In this regard, they are very much in step with the
general public,'' wrote Yeager, a political science professor at
San Jose State University.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike recent surveys of women officeholders, which showed they
conduct business differently than their male counterparts, Yeager's
survey did not attempt to measure the impact gay elected officials
may be having on legislation or on the political process.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a start to look at this in an academic way,'' he said.
``I didn't have the means to do that, but I hope it generates
further research so we can answer those questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeager focused on who the gay officeholders are and how they got
there.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the survey, he interviewed 14 elected officials that
he compiled in a new Haworth Press book, ``Trailblazers: Profiles
of America's Gay and Lesbian Officials.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As ane elected official myself, I knew there was very little
information about us,'' Yeager said. ``When I ran for office, I was
sort of on my own. I knew if it was true for me, it was true for
others.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that gays and lesbians are an ``incredibly small
minority of people who have been able to get elected. You couldn't
find a group more underrepresented in our democracy. I don't think
even gays and lesbians understand.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among his findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ Most of those surveyed weren't elected from overwhelmingly gay
districts. Two-thirds said their district was 10 percent gay or
less.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eighty-three percent got more than 20 percent of the money for
their first campaign from the gay community, with 35 percent
getting more than 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ A quarter of those kept quiet their sexual orientation quiet
enough that the public probably didn't know, Yeager concluded.
</P>
<P>
   _ One-third said they were out but the news media never reported
it and they didn't say so in their campaign literature.
</P>
<P>
   _ Thirty-nine percent said the public likely knew because both
they and the news media made a point of it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two-thirds said they didn't face anti-gay attacks in their
first run for office. But the rest did _ either ``evident but not
vicious'' or ``full-blown'' attacks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Twenty-six states have no openly gay or lesbian politicians.

REMEDY RESEARCH: SOME HINTS, FEW ANSWERS

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eager to relieve the agonizing symptoms of winter viruses,
sufferers are widening the search for remedies well beyond the
conventional treatments. But even as Americans gobble $12 million
worth of vitamins, herbs and supplements annually, scientists and
others say there is not enough solid research to evaluate their
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, is beginning to change.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, alternative medicine drew attention when The Journal
of the American Medical Association published its first issue
devoted to herbal medicine. Other journals are also reporting on
such therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the findings about the effectiveness of several
popular alternative treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ECHINACEA Called the most popular herb in the United States,
echinacea is generating more than $300 million in sales annually.
Although a 1992 study of the use of echinacea demonstrated a
significant decrease in symptoms and duration of flulike illness, a
review of 12 commonly used medicinal herbs published in the
Archives of Family Medicine in November noted that of 26 published
controlled trials evaluating the plant, none were conclusive.
</P>
<P>
   The review, with lead authors from the University of Washington,
concluded: ``Available evidence on echinacea's therapeutic
potential is incomplete, but does suggest a possible supportive
role in treating infections and wounds. However, well-designed
clinical trials are needed to substantiate echinacea's efficacy,
clarify appropriate dosages and confirm safety.'' For boosting
immune systems, dosages have not been standardized, but the 1992
study suggested a link between benefits and dosage.
</P>
<P>
   In the same issue, Dr. Dieter Melchart of the Center for
Complementary Medicine Research in Munich, Germany, reported the
results of a clinical trial in which 302 volunteers received either
one or two echinacea extracts or a placebo. The 12-week study found
echinacea no more effective than a placebo in preventing colds.
</P>
<P>
   GARLIC With a long history in the kitchen and in warding off
colds and vampires, garlic is one of the most extensively studied
medicinal herbs. Louis Pasteur identified its antiseptic properties
in 1858.
</P>
<P>
   Results from recent clinical trials attempting to confirm other
uses have been mixed, according to the Archives of Family Medicine
herbal review. In late 1997, Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy,
the journal of the American Society for Microbiology, reported the
discovery of a molecular mechanism that might explain some of
garlic's medicinal uses.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the Weizmann Institute in Israel contend that
allicin, the main biologically active component of garlic, blocks
certain enzymes associated with bacterial, fungal and viral
infections.
</P>
<P>
   VITAMIN C Linus Pauling, who won the Nobel Peace Prize and the
Nobel Prize in Chemistry, launched a controversy still being played
out in laboratories around the world when he published a book,
``Vitamin C and the Common Cold,'' in 1970, asserting that vitamin
C could prevent colds. He later expanded his theories to include
flu and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   He advocated taking at least 1,000 milligrams of vitamin C daily
and took 18,000 milligrams a day himself, although the recommended
daily allowance is 60.
</P>
<P>
   No conclusive data have shown that such large doses
significantly protect against the common cold, but many people
remain convinced. The recommended daily allowance is under
scrutiny, with the National Institutes of Health recommending an
increase to 200 milligrams.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, vitamin C turns up in various over-the-counter
remedies and foods, and the Japanese have even added it to cola.
</P>
<P>
   ZINC LOZENGES Zinc lozenges as a cold remedy surfaced with
George Eby, a Texas math major who became a city planner then fell
into biomedical research in 1979 when his young daughter, suffering
from leukemia, had a severe cold. The cold appeared cured after a
crushed zinc gluconate tablet dissolved in her mouth.
</P>
<P>
   By 1984, Eby was reporting tests in which the lozenges
significantly reduced how long cold symptoms lasted. In 1996 a
Cleveland Clinic study found that sucking on zinc gluconate
lozenges reduced the duration of cold symptoms although the
lozenges tasted bad and 20 percent of the people who took them
reported nausea.
</P>
<P>
   Later trials have been less conclusive. Mayo Clinic specialists
suggest caution for children, pregnant women and people with
chronic kidney or liver disease.

MASTERING THE PRACTICAL CURTSY, ON SKIS

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What was I doing on this snow-covered hillside, trying to make
artful turns on my cross-country skis? I gave up downhill skiing in
the first place, nearly 20 years ago, because I was too nervous to
ski with enough confident speed to carve classy turns and handle
the big, steep, mogul-filled hills.
</P>
<P>
   But now I was deep into the ``telemark,'' a technique I had
avoided for years. Developed about 100 years ago and named for a
region in Norway, telemarking is something like a hybrid of
cross-country and downhill skiing.
</P>
<P>
   Telemarkers use skis with a free heel and employ a series of
turns to navigate a serious mountain and to ski through the
magnificent vistas of untracked back country.
</P>
<P>
   But I didn't think I needed this technique. I enjoy
cross-country skiing and have become fairly strong and
accomplished, capable of handling everything from the bridle path
in Central Park to intermediate trails, both tracked and untracked.
I can also manage the occasional black diamond trails, the
designation applied to the most difficult, in places like Yosemite
National Park; Big Sky, Montana; Aspen, Colo.; Jackson Hole, Wyo.;
and the Catskills, Adirondacks and White Mountains. Without the
telemark.
</P>
<P>
   When challenged by a steep stretch of terrain I could always
snowplow. This bit of expertise looks like its name and is done in
a pigeon-toed stance while digging in with the inside edges of the
skis. It forces the tails of the skis outward while the tips almost
meet, and is effective at slowing you down on some pretty steep
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Only small children would snowplow in public on downhill trails.
But for a cross-country skier, the snowplow, though hardly
attractive, is unembarrassingly handy. Depending on how much you
stem one ski or the other, and how you place your weight, you can
also execute a well-controlled turn on a snowplow.
</P>
<P>
   So why would I need that odd-looking telemark turn, which seemed
awkward, with an exaggerated, deeply bent knee? It always looked to
me like a curtsy on skis, something I figured I would have to do
only in the unlikely event that Queen Elizabeth II suddenly
materialized on the ski slope.
</P>
<P>
   About a month ago, at the Home Ranch, a resort in Clark, Colo.,
near Steamboat Springs, I joined a group of six skiers led by Ty
Upson, a patient and proficient instructor, for a lesson in
turning. After about half an hour, the novices, who were just
learning the snowplow, left for the lodge. Upson proposed the
telemark.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of turns in skiing, for both downhill and
cross-country, is to control speed by allowing the skier to zigzag
across the fall line, or the direct route down the hill, instead of
straight down it, as gravity demands. But turns are hard for the
cross-country skier to carve, given the relatively light boots
clamped only at the toe to narrow skis that are close to six feet
long and often do not have metal edges.
</P>
<P>
   When Upson demonstrated a telemark turn for us, I was
astonished. He did not go into that deep knee bend. ``Anyone who
teaches telemark turns by having you go all the way down on one
knee is teaching it wrong,'' he said. ``It's just a matter of
pulling one ankle back as you lift your heel. That makes the knee
bend so it sits just behind your front knee, which also must bend,
but not very deeply. It should be very easy and feel natural.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for the queen.
</P>
<P>
   Do you want to see how a telemark is done? Watch ski jumping.
The landing is a classic telemark, with one ski behind the other
and the knees bent. The move was developed for ski jumping, which
also involves a free heel.
</P>
<P>
   Upson had us start at the top of a broad but gentle slope
standing across the fall line. We pulled one ski back, lifted the
heel and allowed the other ski to slide forward. He said the stance
_ with one ski forward, the other back _ created a longer stable
base than the one created with both skis together. The bent-knee
position forced the body lower, with a lower center of gravity,
adding to the stability.
</P>
<P>
   Without using our ski poles he first had us spring straight up
and down in this position, just so we could feel how stable the
position was. We did not need to bend our knees very deeply. Then
we turned nearly into the fall line. It was time to telemark.
</P>
<P>
   As my skis began to slide, I pulled my right foot back and
lifted my heel, slightly bending my knee, and felt my left ski,
which had now slid forward, begin to trace a wide arc around to the
right. A turn!
</P>
<P>
   It did not take me long to understand and to begin to execute a
rudimentary, somewhat unsteady but promising telemark turn. The
weight shift that came from pulling the ski back forced the skis to
turn. By standing taller, as I completed the turn, both skis came
together and began running. I then segued into the next turn.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Anyone trying back-country ski touring in the mountains has to
know how to telemark, which is designed for descending a wide
mountain slope. It will not work on narrow woodland trails.
</P>
<P>
   Using telemark turns, skiers can cross a slope at an angle,
linking one turn after another in the same direction, with the same
skis front and back, a move that is called a garland. You need a
wide expanse of hillside for this but it is the best way to control
your speed on a steep slope. The other option is to alternate
directions, going from left foot to right foot in front, and
criss-cross the slope.
</P>
<P>
   Though I tried telemarking with my cross-country skis and boots,
there is equipment made specifically for telemarkers. The skis have
metal edges and are shorter and more parabolic than touring or
regular cross-country equipment to facilitate turning. And though,
as with all cross-country skis, the bindings clamp only the toe of
the boot, there is a housing for the heel that adds to the
stability.
</P>
<P>
   The newest telemark boots are high and plastic, developed in the
sorts of jazzy colors that even the sleek, Lycra-clad cross-country
devotees usually avoid. The poles are the same as those used for
cross-country.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need this kind of gear to learn the basics, or to
execute a competent turn when the terrain requires it, as Upson
explained. But to get involved in telemark competitions, which are
starting to be featured at some ski areas, it is becoming
increasingly important to look the part.
</P>
<P>
   The next day I tried practicing on my own but my turns were
clumsy and seemed uncoordinated. The problem, I realized, was that
the area where I was trying to turn was too narrow for a beginner
like me, and I could not complete the turns. But after another
lesson, I felt at ease once again and could begin linking my turns
in one direction, then the other.
</P>
<P>
   I felt fine, not too sore or tired after telemarking, because I
am used to cross-country skiing, which is great aerobic exercise,
giving the limbs, shoulders, hips and heart a vigorous workout.
Telemarking, at least at the beginner level, calls for less
endurance and strength, a few smooth tango steps compared with
cross-country's dance marathon.
</P>
<P>
   And though there are no ski lifts in the back country to help
with going up the hills, now that telemarking is becoming popular
in downhill areas, the telemarkers have started using the lifts.
</P>
<P>
   During my lessons, I trudged back up the hill each time, and
wound up shedding my jacket and hat, skiing just in a shirt and a
sweater, with tights, gloves and warm socks, even though the
temperature was about 15 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   And I was happy to keep working on my technique and expect to
continue my courtship with the telemark turn. I may never try
back-country touring excursions, going from hut to hut and staying
overnight in primitive conditions. But then, I never thought I
would try the telemark either. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Telemark ski lessons are offered at some cross-country centers
and resorts and, increasingly, at many downhill areas in the
Northeast and in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Rates range from about $20 an hour for a group lesson to about
$60 for a one-hour private lesson. Ski centers that give lessons
usually rent the equipment, $15 a day and up. Some, like the
Gunstock Ski Touring Center in Laconia, N.H., have combined
equipment rental and lesson packages, $39 midweek and $45 on
weekends. An hour lesson with equipment rental at Big Sky in
Montana is $70. At the Home Ranch, which offers an all-inclusive
weekly rate, there is no extra charge for lessons and equipment. &QL;

FOUNDERING UPN REACHES OUT FOR A CARTOON LIFELINE IN `DILBERT'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ A week ago, the corporate corrilors within
UPN were thick with the message that this was it, that the
struggling network known more for its$humiliating failures than
even the meekest success had found its ``Seinfeld,'' its ``Buffy
the Vampire Slayer,'' its savior.
</P>
<P>
   So sure was UPN that an animated version of the popular comic
strip ``Dilbert'' could salvage its future that the network put a
huge promotional push behind this weekly half-hour show, which
debuted Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The strip chronicles the adventures of a frustrated corporate
nerd and his neurotic colleagues, capturing the absurdity of office
politics so perfectly that its panels are posted in cubicles
everywhere; UPN obviously hopes its series will reach the same
level of ubiquitousness.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, the network went all out at the press tour.
Crammed into a few hours were a tete-a-tete with the show's
producers and voice talent, a live-action Dilbert ``game show,''
and a lavish sit-down supper, all in hopes of smoothing over
misconceptions about a network considered chronically
mistake-prone.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, sensing reporters' impatience during the very long,
very boring ``game show,'' Dean Valentine, UPN's CEO and president,
jumped up to announce a $25,000 payoff to each and every journalist
enduring the torture.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't win your respect,'# he said, ``we'll buy it!''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes, classic Valentine sarcasm, just one of a string of such
attempts lately that has missed its intended target, much like his
batch of television shows.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine had greeted the media that day wearing an Abraham
Lincoln-ish top hat, mocking his own failed series, ``The Secret
Life of Desmond Pfeiffer,'' a painfully humorless, over-the-top
farce about a black English butler working in the Lincoln White
House.
</P>
<P>
   At least Valentine admitted that the protests from a cross
section of African-American activist groups didn't send
``Pfeiffer'' packing _ it was the show's cartoonish execution and
lousy ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were wrong,'' Valentine said of ``Pfeiffer,'' in a
statement that might constitute a first among network CEOs.
</P>
<P>
   Started in 1995 as the network showcasing ``Star Trek: Voyager''
and sitcoms appealing largely to black viewers, UPN has lately
become the symbol of rotten television. Valentine and Entertainment
President Tom Nunan shifted strategy last season by dropping some
black-oriented programs like ``In the House'' and ``Good News'' and
casting a wider demographic net.
</P>
<P>
   UPN executives expected a tough sell but hardly the audience
exodus that occurred, even after boldly moving up to five nights of
programming. UPN's average prime-time audience dropped from 4.6
million last year to a humiliating 2.7 million this season.
(Meanwhile, the WB, the other network started at the same time, has
increased its audience to 4.6 million.)
</P>
<P>
   With nine of the 10 lowest-rated series being UPN shows,
``disappointing'' is how Valentine sums up his network's
performance this season. On deck: ``Home Movies,'' an animated
sitcom, and ``Family Rules,'' about a widowed father and his four
teen-age daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a responsibility to be more innovative and
interesting than the other guys,'' Valentine said, before pausing
and adding, ``We simply have to try harder to be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying harder meant the acquisition of the ``Dilbert''
franchise, which has a huge following among comic strip devotees
(150 million readers in 57 countries) and within the corporate
structure it so successfully mocks.
</P>
<P>
   It's still something of a mystery why this series isn't on Fox,
as that's where the comic strip's creator, Scott Adams, took it
initially.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dilbert'' originated as a live-action series but was dumped by
Fox after it apparently couldn't be pulled off creatively. (Perhaps
it was a bit tough to sell to audiences a talking dog named Dogbert
who has a gleeful affinity for terrorizing humans.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to just step back and ask ourselves, `Should we try and
tweak that, or do a start from scratch?' '' says Adams, who is
co-producer along with Larry Charles, the Emmy-decorated
writer/producer of ``Seinfeld'' and ``Mad About You.'' ``We were
really just looking at all the options, and UPN was the best
option.''
</P>
<P>
   Animation gives ``Dilbert'' far more leeway in what it can do.
For instance, who'll complain about Dilbert's nude shower scene? Or
about Dogbert burning down an entire block of businesses for
corporate gain?
</P>
<P>
   Chris Elliott lends the perfect, snide, smart-alecky pitch to
Dogbert. Daniel Stern is Dilbert, while Kathy Griffin voices Alice,
Gordon Hunt is Wally, Larry Miller is the pointy-haired boss and
Jackie Hoffman is Dilmom.

   ``I think if this show is going to succeed, it has to work on
many levels, like all great cartoons, such as `Bugs Bunny' or `The
Simpsons,' '' said Charles. ``We tried to sort of fashion `Dilbert'
the same way, so that a child can enjoy it on a certain level and a
teen-ager who's stoned in his dorm room can enjoy it, and adults
can enjoy it, and elderly people and dead people, whatever group

thinking inside out. It's just the hardest thing in the world for
me.''

   Adams credits an estimated 300 e-mails a day with keeping his
creative juices flowing about a corporate culture he left long ago.

   Most of the e-mails are ``cries for help,'' he said jokingly.
``And some of them kind of directly suggest a story. But usually
they'll remind me of some hideous experience I had of my own.''

THE NEVER-CHANGING WORLD OF SINGINGS

<P>
   Music's only constant is change.
</P>
<P>
   What seems so cutting-edge and different one day is old hat a
few months later; we look, over and over, for the next sound, the
next star, the next group to anoint.
</P>
<P>
   And yet next Saturday anyone can go to Southwestern Baptist
Theological Seminary in Fort Worth and, for free, hear a type of
music that has survived virtually unchanged since the mid-1800s,
music that Southerners performed when they left their individual
farms for community ``singings.''
</P>
<P>
   It's called Sacred Harp, or shape-note singing, a type of a
cappella religious folk music, and it has a uniquely stirring,
rough-hewn power. And though it survives (mainly in the South),
chances to hear it _ at least in Texas _ are relatively few and far
between.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes next weekend's Sacred Harp Singing at the seminary's
Cowden Hall all the more important. This is one of the city's
enduring musical traditions _ mainly for those familiar with the
music, but also for anyone who has a few hours to spend stepping
backward in time to get a taste of America's musical roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only singing in Fort Worth that I know of,'' said
Dr. David Music, one of the seminary's professors of church music.
``It's a phenomenon of long-standing.''
</P>
<P>
   Named after ``The Sacred Harp,'' a book published in 1844 by
B.F. White and E.J. King, Sacred Harp singing has its roots in
Europe. Folk tunes brought over with immigrants and secular lyrics
were converted to sacred tunes, Music said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Singing schools'' developed in 18th century New England,
before the Revolutionary War; they used the English solemnization
technique, which uses syllables ``fa,'' ``sol,'' ``la'' and ``mi''
to denote tones of a musical scale. In the early 1800s a method of
denoting the syllables with different symbols was developed; this
made being able to read notes unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   And this, naturally, made the music more accessible. There were
numerous hymn books published; the most popular of these was ``The
Sacred Harp.'' People took these hymns with them as Kentucky,
Alabama, Tennessee and Georgia were settled _ and then on to Texas.
The first East Texas Sacred Harp Singing Convention dates from
1868.
</P>
<P>
   The songs were the basis of community get-togethers, which also
featured potluck suppers. According to author Keith Willard, people
would bring their books and sing ``for hours and days at a time,
usually after the crops were planted and before their harvest.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, as now, the singers are seated in a square, with tenors
facing altos and basses facing trebles. A ``leader'' is in the
middle, and calls the tune. However, the leader can be literally
anybody who signs up, Music said, no matter how old, be they
pre-teens or senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   A small number of men sitting on the front row of the tenor
section ``pitch'' the tune (give the leader the pitch) and begin
the song.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody sings the starting note and off you go,'' said Dr.
William J. Reynolds, a distinguished emeritus professor of church
music and the man who began the singing at the seminary after
attending similar events in Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee. ``You
sing the syllables first and then the lyrics. It doesn't sound like
anything you've ever heard.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no groups per se, Music said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone comes from different places, and it's one big
group,'' he said. ``Listeners are in the minority. We'll probably
have 100 to 120 people singing. And because it's participatory, the
sound is raw _ there's no attempt at nice tone quality. You choose
what part you sing, and how you sing it is up to you, as long as
you sing out.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last several years, Reynolds said, the appeal of Sacred
Harp has lessened a bit in rural areas, but has picked up in cities
and on college campuses. Reynolds said that vocalists came ``out of
the woodwork'' when the seminary's first singing was announced, and
that people who love the music are incredibly devoted to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more than 500 singings in the U.S. every year,'' he
said. ``I will go a long way to sing this music. I come home tired
and hoarse, but my cup is full. My cup is full.''
</P>

   INFO BOX
</P>
<P>
   The Fifteenth Annual Sacred Harp Singing will be on Saturday,
Jan. 30, in the rotunda of Cowden Hall on the Southwestern Baptist
Theological Seminary campus in Fort Worth. The event is 9:30 a.m.
to 3 p.m. and is free. From Interstate 35 take the Seminary Drive
exit and go west. Turn left at the main entrance into the seminary
on William Fleming Court. Cowden Hall is the first large building
on the left.

   Stars, galaxies of stars, and clusters of galaxies, these are
the more familiar members in the hierarchy of structure in the
universe. But there are things much, much bigger: superclusters,
agglomerations of galaxies and galaxy clusters that stretch across
millions of light-years of space.
</P>
<P>
   In awe and puzzlement, astronomers have been studying
superclusters for several decades, and now they are convinced that
these vast structures are real, not illusory patterns on the sky.
``We're sure these are not like the canals of Mars,'' said Dr.
Martha P. Haynes, an authority on superclusters at Cornell
University.
</P>
<P>
   New observations are still full of surprises, though. And they
are giving astronomers revealing glimpses into the mysteries of how
the universe, which presumably began smooth and featureless,
evolved its current rich textures through time and gravity acting
on immense scales. In particular, these enormous clusterings may
hold clues to cosmic growth processes because they appear to be the
culminating architecture arising from the first observed building
blocks in the earliest universe, the faint ripples in the microwave
background radiation left by the Big Bang.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Austin,
Texas, this month, scientists learned that they have probably been
underestimating the sizes of the known superclusters. Surveying
X-ray emissions, the Rosat spacecraft found several undetected
galaxy clusters in the gravitational realm of one supercluster in
the northern sky. The discovery, astronomers said, doubled the
known size of the supercluster, now estimated to span 400 million
light-years and thus one of the largest ever examined.
</P>
<P>
   Other astronomers reported observations showing that a
supercluster in the constellation Aquarius consisted of two long
filaments of connecting galaxy clusters. One of the filaments,
extending 1 billion light-years, is the longest such object yet
seen in the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Batuski, an astronomer at the University of Maine in
Orono, said this region of the southern sky had ``a surprising
amount of superclustering'' and was ``providing us with a more
complete picture of clumpiness'' in the universe. The structure
seemed to be further evidence, he said, that the origins of
superclusters could probably be traced to the extremely tiny lumps
and bumps in the early universe, amplified greatly by time.
</P>
<P>
   A third group, analyzing data from radiotelescopes, reported the
existence of high-speed winds of dilute gases blowing along the
long axis of superclusters and probably feeding matter into galaxy
clusters within the larger structure. The astronomers said the
winds were the first dynamical evidence for how superclusters
formed.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Adrian Melott of the University of Kansas at Lawrence, who
described the ``superwinds,'' said: ``This is our first detection
of exactly the kind of winds we think should result from the flow
of matter along superclusters. It looks as if we are beginning to
develop a good understanding of the formation of structure in the
universe.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Dr. Haynes said the findings were important ``increments
of knowledge'' about the development and nature of such large
structures. The exceedingly long filaments, she said, were
unexpected because ``it's easier to make and understand small
ones.'' And the superwinds, she added, could lead to an
understanding of how material collapsed to form superclusters.
</P>
<P>
   The reality of superclusters did not sink in until the 1980s,
when new telescopes and sensors could measure distances to objects
and produce three-dimensional maps of the universe. One of the most
spectacular results was finding the ``Great Wall,'' a vast sheet of
connecting galaxies and galactic clusters mapped in 1989 by Dr.
Margaret J. Geller and Dr. John P. Huchra of the
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Great Wall is a supercluster or something
distinctive and even larger has yet to be determined. Astronomers
have yet to agree on a sharp definition of superclusters and are
only beginning to develop a clear mental picture of them.
</P>
<P>
   Superclusters are typically seen as long and thin strands of
clusters and galaxies, intracluster gases and, presumably, ``dark
matter,'' the invisible stuff that constitutes most of the
universe's mass and gravitational force. The strands are
interspersed by large voids nearly empty of galaxies. Drawings of
the tangled skeins look like thick Swiss cheese slices. The voids
are so considerable that, overall, superclusters are only a few
times denser than the average volume of space.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   A supercluster is part of Earth's cosmic address. Just as the
Sun and its planets are on the outskirts of the Milky Way galaxy,
the Milky Way is part of the so-called Local Group, which is on the
outskirts of what is recognized as the Local Supercluster,
dominated by the giant Virgo cluster in the constellation of the
same name.
</P>
<P>
   One of many questions about superclusters is just how big are
they. Is there a typical or maximum size? Do their sizes betray
their origins and growth processes? It is too early for answers,
but the recent X-ray survey opened many eyes.
</P>
<P>
   A region around the North Ecliptic Pole Supercluster, 1.3
billion light-years from Earth in the constellation Draco, was
surveyed by the X-ray telescope on Rosat, a spacecraft developed by
Germany, Britain and the United States. This supercluster,
discovered in 1985, incorporated six clusters, each of which held
several hundred galaxies. But picking up faint X-ray emissions,
Rosat revealed the presence of six new clusters, which formed a
kind of bridge across to galactic structures not previously
associated with the supercluster. The X-rays, a signature of galaxy
clusters, come from hot intergalactic gas, which is heated by
collisions and mergers of galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were reported by Christopher Mullis, a University
of Hawaii graduate student who conducted the research for his
thesis, and Dr. J. Patrick Henry, an astronomer at the university.
The additional clusters at least doubled the supercluster's size,
Henry said, making it about 70 percent of the size of the Aquarius
Supercluster, the largest known. ``Since we have only surveyed one
side of this supercluster, it could be larger still,'' he said.
``Are all superclusters similarly larger than previously
suspected?''
</P>
<P>
   Another member of the research team, Dr. Isabella Gioia, an
Italian astronomer at the University of Hawaii, mused that the
discovery bore out computer simulations of theorists studying
cosmic evolution. The detection of such large-scale structure in
this relatively small area of the northern sky, she said, ``tells
us that the universe may really be composed of a web of filaments
and voids on scales of several hundred million light-years, as has
been indicated repeatedly by computer calculations of the growth of
structure in the universe.''
</P>
<P>
   Launched in 1990, the successful Rosat finally came to its end
last month after observing more than 100,000 cosmic X-ray sources.
Other orbiting X-ray observatories are in the offing, with the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Chandra X-ray
Observatory to be launched this summer. But Henry advocated
launching a satellite expressly for supercluster studies because
none of the planned missions would have large enough fields of view
for meaningful supercluster observations.
</P>
<P>
   The winds blowing through superclusters had been detected
before, said Melott, but seeing their alignment with the
supercluster axis was new and reassuring. Jack O. Burns, an
astronomer at the University of Missouri at Columbia, has contended
that as gas, stars and galaxies fall together into clusters, the
mergers should give rise to winds.
</P>
<P>
   The reported radio observations showed the direction of the
winds by the way they bent jets of electrified gases emitted from
the cores of galaxies, probably from the regions of powerful
gravitational sinks known as black holes. The effect was much the
same as an earthly breeze directing smoke rising from a chimney.
And these wind directions were lined up with the galactic clusters
within superclusters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before this we only had snapshots; now we have bits of a
movie,'' Melott said. ``We know structure like the ones seen can be
produced by gravity, but we've had no evidence of the particular
kinds of flows that bring them about.''
</P>
<P>
   Melott said the winds across a supercluster are in the right
direction and at the right speed to feed matter, including stars,
galaxies and gas swept up and transported by the winds, into
growing galactic clusters, as many astronomers had theorized. In
this case, he concluded, it is likely that some form of the
superclusters existed before the galaxy clusters in them took their
present shapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Superclusters are so big that their basic pattern could not
have changed much since the early universe,'' Henry said. ``We are
probably seeing the original pattern of structure in the
universe.''
</P>
<P>
   Melott said it might be more accurate to think of superclusters
as ``extrapolations from initial conditions in the universe, not as
an unevolved structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Some new findings suggested that the evolution of cosmic
large-scale structure followed a more complex course than
previously thought. Many theorists had subscribed to a simpler idea
of ``bottom-up'' evolution, progressing from stars and galaxies to
clusters, on to superclusters.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Haynes had one of the few uncontested comments on
superclusters. ``We're still trying,'' she said, ``to learn the
process of how these things formed.''

RISE IN INFECTIONS COULD TURN MILD FLU SEASON NASTY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   So far the flu season has been as mild as the weather, according
to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta _ although it may not seem that way for anyone who has
wrestled with a bout.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not mean the pattern will continue. In an update
released last week, the agency warned that infections had been on
the upswing since mid-December and that flu activity might increase
through the winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Influenza is unpredictable,'' said Dr. Tim Uyeki, who
generates computer models from reports the agency gathers from
various governmental agencies around the country. ``We could have a
mild season or encounter a bad problem starting next week, but
infections are likely to increase.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first 14 weeks of the flu season, which began in October,
most states reported sporadic activity; four states and the
District of Columbia reported no activity at all up to Jan. 9. New
York City alone experienced what the CDC considered widespread
activity with outbreaks reported by long-term health care
facilities in all five boroughs. Epidemiologists consider influenza
outbreaks in nursing homes reflective of the larger community.
</P>
<P>
   The number of flu cases is on the rise in New York, but Dr. Neal
Cohen, the Health Department commissioner, finds nothing unusual in
the 26 outbreaks reported so far in New York City nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   After a slow start, the flu season picked up ``quite
significantly'' in the past three weeks, Cohen said. ``While flu
symptoms have generally not been as severe as in recent years, any
strain of the flu can be serious and even life-threatening,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Influenza viruses tend to change over time or to change
abruptly, but all cases reported so far this year have been caused
by viruses covered in this season's flu shot, said Dr. Carolyn
Buxton Bridges, a federal epidemiologist.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine protects only against respiratory illnesses caused
by influenza viruses, she cautioned. Many people use the term flu
to refer to a number of different illnesses, which can be caused by
various viral and bacterial agents. The vaccine does not protect
against respiratory illnesses like colds, which are caused by other
viruses, or against gastrointestinal ills commonly called the
stomach flu, Bridges said.
</P>
<P>
   Flu shots should be given from October through mid-November, but
they are still worth getting later than that, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   People over 65, nursing home residents, anyone with chronic
medical conditions, pregnant women and children ages 6 months to 18
years on chronic aspirin therapy are among those advised to seek
inoculations, as are health care workers and the relatives of
people at risk.

<P>
   Q. What are cats' whiskers for?
</P>
<P>
   A. Whiskers give cats a variety of important sensory information
and also have a role in communication between cats, said Dr. James
Richards, a veterinarian, who heads the of Cornell Feline Health
Center at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   They are far more important to a cat than a dog's whiskers are
to a dog, and they should never be trimmed, as they tell a cat
whether it can squeeze through a narrow passage, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Technically called vibrissae, whiskers or tactile hairs are
clustered in three major groups on the sides of the cheeks, above
the eyes and farther back on the cheeks. There are also a few on
the chin and shorter ones on the back of the front legs.
</P>
<P>
   Stiffer and at least twice as thick as ordinary hairs, vibrissae
have roots that go three times as deep in the skin and are
surrounded by nerves and blood vessels. The slightest motion of a
hair, even from a breath of air, triggers a sensation.
</P>
<P>
   Vibrissae are helpful to a cat maneuvering in dark areas,
especially when hunting, Richards said, and when a cat has prey in
its cupped paws, ready to move it toward the mouth, the hairs give
signals of the next meal's exact position.
</P>
<P>
   As for communication between cats, whiskers pushed forward may
indicate friendliness or inquisitiveness, but when they are pulled
back flat against the cheeks, they can signal either aggressive or
defensive hostility.

ESSAY: AMID THE ANTIHISTAMINES, A QUEST FOR LOGIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ABIGAIL ZUGER, M.D.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Head throbbing, nose dripping, my friend Alison made the serious
error of trying to apply deductive logic to the contents of the
cold and cough aisle of her local supermarket a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   If her usual brand of antihistamine worked for her usual runny
nose, she reasoned, then surely the ``maximum strength sinus''
version of the same brand was what she needed for whatever evil
combination of allergy, congestion and cold was causing her current
misery.
</P>
<P>
   But 24 hours later she was back in the same aisle, honking into
her tissue and trying to figure out what had gone wrong. It took a
careful perusal of the almost-invisible type on the back of the
boxes to solve the problem: Her maximum-strength antihistamines,
oddly enough, had no antihistamine in them.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they contained a large slug of acetaminophen (the pain
and fever reducer most commonly known as Tylenol) and a little
decongestant. With a generic cold preparation that contained the
right antihistamine, she finally got a full night's sleep.
</P>
<P>
   For those suffering from winter colds and coughs, life holds few
greater pleasures than a trip to the drugstore's cold remedy
section. Its plenty creates the illusion that for every ache, drip
and clog there is the single perfect potion, lovingly designed to
bring each soggy mucous membrane right back to normal and keep it
that way.
</P>
<P>
   But that cornucopia of pills and capsules actually consists of
only a handful of different substances that have been packaged in
virtually every possible combination and permutation, and
christened with ingeniously soothing names.
</P>
<P>
   The effectiveness of these drugs is beyond question: Doctors are
generally happy to send congested patients off to the drugstore to
medicate themselves with whatever brand appeals. The problem is
that foraging through the hundreds of alternatives often requires
more canniness and scholarly acumen than the poor sufferer has
bargained for.
</P>
<P>
   Every line of products is assembled from the same small set of
ingredients. Some follow a certain logic: ``Flu'' preparations
often contain pain and fever reducers like acetaminophen, ibuprofen
or aspirin, while ``sinus'' formulas include a decongestant, often
pseudoephedrine, and ``cough'' remedies contain the cough
suppressant dextromethorphan.
</P>
<P>
   The logic begins to falter in the realm of ``cold'' and
``allergy'' remedies, which generally include antihistamines (often
chlorpheniramine, brompheniramine, or diphenhydramine).
Antihistamines have been proven to reduce the mean number of
tissues used by victims of the common cold, and also the frequency
and violence of their sneezes.
</P>
<P>
   However, while antihistamines that do not cause drowsiness are
available by prescription, they are not yet available over the
counter. Thus, antihistamines are invariably omitted from
``nondrowsy'' preparations, even those intended for colds and
allergies, and they are invariably added into ``nighttime'' or
``PM'' compounds, even those not designed to unclog the nose.
</P>
<P>
   Wildly mysterious non sequiturs may result. For instance, if a
truly dreadful cold drives you to select the yellow-boxed ``severe
congestion'' form of Tylenol Cold Multisymptom brand instead of the
regular version in the green box, you are no longer buying an
antihistamine. Instead you are substituting a dose of guaifenesin,
which decongests by liquefying mucus _ and you may wind up using
even more tissues than before.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not all. If you choose AlkaSeltzer Plus cold and
cough liquigels (packaged in a distinctive lavender box) instead of
AlkaSeltzer Plus cold and cough effervescent tablets (packaged in
the same shade of lavender), you are going to be ingesting
acetaminophen instead of the aspirin that is usually part of the
AlkaSeltzer line.
</P>
<P>
   If you purchase your Vicks Nyquil in liquicaps rather than in a
bottle, you will no longer be treating yourself to a nice shot of
alcohol (to which aficionados of that preparation ascribe many of
its health-promoting qualities).
</P>
<P>
   While the Benadryl line of products all dutifully contain
Benadryl (the antihistamine diphenhydramine), some Tavist products
contain no Tavist (the antihistamine clemastine), and Robitussin
products may or not contain the cough suppressant dextromethorphan.
</P>
<P>
   And if you are a person who likes to dose yourself up, and you
decide to take some Tylenol along with your maximum strength
lemon-flavored Theraflu hot drink every six hours, you may be
ingesting enough acetaminophen over the course of a day to risk
overdose and serious liver damage.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the over-the-counter preparations are
indistinguishable from one another, a remarkable idiosyncracy of
content characterizes many others. So let the buyer be aware: Even
through the fog of a congested head and dripping nose, a clear
understanding of the tiny type on the back of the box _ what drugs
are in there and what they are supposed to do _ is a vital part of
treatment.

   ``PARADE''
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, musicals based on dark subjects have not
done too well on Broadway. For proof, see ``Side Show'' and Paul
Simon's ``The Capeman.''
</P>
<P>
   That could change with ``Parade,'' written by Alfred Uhry with
music by Jason Robert Brown and directed by Harold Prince.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1913 in the South, the story concerns the murder of young
Mary Phagan, a pencil factory worker. Wrongly accused and convicted
of the deed is her employer, Leo Frank, a Jewish Northerner.
</P>
<P>
   The production has a beautifully somber tone, accented by an
ominous tree from which Frank will eventually hang. Brent Carver
and Carolee Carmello give elegant performances as Leo and his wife,
Lucille, and there are some fine moments in choreography and song,
but the production leaves you wishing there was something more.
</P>
<P>
   Still, considering the lot of musicals on Broadway right now,
this is one of the better choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parade'' is on an indefinite run at the Lincoln Center's
Vivian Beaumont Theatre, 150 W. 65th St. $40-$75. Telecharge.
</P>
<P>
   ``COLLECTED STORIES''
</P>
<P>
   This is the performance to see: Uta Hagen in Donald Margulies'
``Collected Stories.'' To say that Hagen is a legend is not
hyperbole. She has literally written books on acting.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, who's that playing opposite, and holding her own with,
Hagen? Fort Worth native Lorca Simons, daughter of Johnny and
Dianne ``Hip Pocket Theatre'' Simons, that's who.
</P>
<P>
   Simons, last seen in the Metroplex in Dallas Theater Center's
``The Collected Works of Billy the Kid,'' plays a headstrong and
promising writing student taken under the wing of Hagen, as a
beloved writer and teacher. Simons has a difficult task ahead of
her: Her character is annoying from the get-go. As her teacher
warms up to her, so does the audience.
</P>
<P>
   William Carden directs this lengthy production, which could
stand a major cut in the fifth scene in which the student, now
published, reads an excerpt from her book. The following scene
reveals that she has betrayed her mentor by publishing fiction
based on stories told in secret. As she is being cast out of her
hero's house, Simons gives a heart-rending performance that
actually makes her seem the victim.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard keeping up with Hagen, a master at being natural
on stage. Watching her work, the way she flits her head in
frustration, the way she uses her hands, the way she moves like a
``real'' person _ now, that's pure theatrical Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collected Stories'' has been extended for an indefinite run at
the Lucille Lortel Theatre, 121 Christopher St. $37.50-$49.50.
Telecharge.
</P>
<P>
   ``HEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH''
</P>
<P>
   Now this is theater.
</P>
<P>
   Writer/actor John Cameron Mitchell has seen a good share of the
spotlight this year with his much-lauded work that, as Rolling
Stone magazine said, ``is the first rock musical that really
rocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Hedwig, once a misunderstood German boy, undergoes a sex-change
operation before the fall of the Berlin Wall. He eventually makes
his way to the States and becomes a self-described trailer-trash
queen in Kansas, only to find that he has spent his various careers
watching his one-time paramour, Tommy Gnosis, become the star he
desperately wanted to be.
</P>
<P>
   The Angry Inch is really rock band Cheater, led by the play's
composer, Stephen Trask. Miriam Shor is Hedwig's skittish comrade
in reverse-drag, Yitzak. As of the first of the year, Michael
Cerveris replaced Mitchell in the title role while Mitchell works
on the movie version for New Line Cinema.
</P>
<P>
   Think ``Ziggy Stardust'' meets ``The Rocky Horror Picture Show''
as conceived by ``Coal Miner's Daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hedwig'' is the first work that seriously has potential to
rival ``Rocky Horror's'' cult status. But where ``Rocky'' has
survived on camp value, ``Hedwig'' has a heart as big as the Kansas
skies.
</P>
<P>
   A must-see.
</P>
<P>
   Hedwig and the Angry Inch is enjoying an indefinite run at the
Jane Street Theatre, 113 Jane St. $39.50-$49.50. Telecharge.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE MOST FABULOUS STORY EVER TOLD''
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to playwright Paul Rudnick (''Jeffrey,'' ``In &AMP; Out'')
to come up with an alternate view of human history.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Most Fabulous Story Ever Told,'' Rudnick offers a
hilarious look at what might have happened had the first humans
been Adam and Steve. Soon joined by Jane and Mabel, the foursome
find their way through history with a little help from their
friends, the ``other'' people.
</P>
<P>
   There's a huge Thornton Wilder influence at work here _ it might
as well be called ``The Gay Skin of Our Teeth.'' Also, in another
Wilder turn, the stage manager becomes a character (and possibly
God?), a la ``Our Town.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudnick is quite adept with one-liners, and while the play
doesn't do much to provoke thought (religion and homosexuality have
been crossed in much more compelling ways before), it's delicious
fun. Chalk this one up as another production destined for the big
screen.
</P>
<P>
   After a successful trial at the New York Theatre Workshop, ``The
Most Fabulous Story Ever Told'' reopens Friday and runs through
April 4 at the Minetta Lane Theatre, 18 Minetta Lane. Tickets are
$35-$47.50. Ticketmaster.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dark, rich and lusciously sweet, chocolate is the most
irresistible of confections, so addictive that it has been
suspected of intoxicating with marijuana-like opiates and chemicals
that can mimic the brain chemistry of a person in love. Chocolate
seems to have a special power over women, who consistently rate it
as their No. 1 food craving and whose desire for it often
intensifies around the time of menstruation.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, scientists have hypothesized that a woman's need to
order a triple chocolate cake or to make a midnight run for fudge
brownie ice cream may not be mere indulgence, but instead her
body's attempt to satisfy a natural need for the powerful chemistry
of chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   But now, that comforting hypothesis may have to give way to
plain old guilt once again. In a study of college students in the
United States and Spain, an international team of researchers found
that the peculiarly female lust for chocolate appears not to be
physiological but cultural.
</P>
<P>
   In a study to be published later this year in the journal
Appetite, researchers found that among people who craved sweets,
American women craved chocolate much more often than American men,
as expected. But Spanish women who craved sweets did not show the
same intense devotion to chocolate. In fact, among those craving
sweets, Spanish women were no more enthusiastic about chocolate
than Spanish men.
</P>
<P>
   The finding has shaken the foundations of the theory that the
female body naturally seeks and desires chocolate and may force
chocoholic women to look elsewhere for reassurance about their
habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chocolate craving isn't physiological,'' said Dr. Debra
Zellner, psychologist at Shippensburg University in Shippensburg,
Pa. ``There has to be something other than a physiological need and
it's probably cultural. We taught ourselves this addiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marcia Pelchat, a sensory psychologist at the Monell
Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia, called the work an
important first step in cross-cultural studies of cravings. ``I
believe there is a strong cultural basis for craving for
chocolate,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The new paper is one of a growing number on chocolate in the
relatively new field of appetite studies in which researchers use
tools like scratch-and-sniff tests and questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
   Zellner did the research with Dr. Scott Parker at American
University and Dr. Ana Garriga-Trillo at Universidad Nacional de
Educacion a Distancia in Spain, both psychologists, and two student
assistants, Elizabeth Rohm and Soraya Centeno at Shippensburg. They
asked 240 Spanish and 178 American college students to fill out a
questionnaire rating different foods and naming the foods they
craved the most.
</P>
<P>
   Among Americans, 60 percent of men craved salty or
meat-containing foods and 60 percent of women craved sweet. The
same pattern was found in Spanish men and women, suggesting that
this still unexplained phenomenon might be based on some essential
physiological difference between men and women.
</P>
<P>
   When researchers looked into chocolate cravings in particular,
they found that among sweet cravers, nearly 50 percent of the
American women craved chocolate while fewer than 20 percent of
American men did. But among Spanish sweet cravers, around 25
percent of both sexes craved chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Zellner said physiological differences between Spanish and
American women were unlikely to explain differences in chocolate
cravings. Cultural differences are a much more likely explanation,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After filling out the questionnaire, a number of Spanish
students asked, `What's so important about chocolate?''' she noted.
``Chocolate is not a big deal over there.''
</P>
<P>
   The new study flies in the face of what has become a cottage
industry of research aimed at discovering what chemical chocolate
harbors that makes it irresistible, not only to women, but to
everyone. Chemically complex, chocolate contains not only caffeine
but also mood-altering chemicals known as cannabinoids (the same
family of potent molecules found in marijuana) and other molecules
that cause cannabinoids to accumulate in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is you'd have to eat a humongous amount _ we're
talking 27 pounds of chocolate at a sitting _ to have any
pharmacologic effect,'' said Pelchat, suggesting that a
drug-induced high is not what makes people crave chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Others have suggested that chocolate eaters are essentially
treating themselves for depression, or, in the case of many women,
for premenstrual depression. Researchers say carbohydrates in
chocolate raise levels of the brain chemical serotonin, improving
mood. But a lot of foods contain carbohydrates. Still others say
the key is phenylethylamine, a chemical said to mimic the brain
chemistry of a person in love. But, Pelchat notes, ``It's been
argued that a salami sandwich could do the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Zellner said chocolate's appeal might boil down to a more
mundane phenomenon, well known to psychologists, that people like
to eat what is familiar. In the United States, in contrast to
Spain, she said, chocolate is ubiquitous. Perhaps as important,
``every culture has its very special or wonderful foods,'' Zellner
said.
</P>
<P>
   The implication, said Zellner, is that at least in theory
American women could abandon chocolate and teach themselves to
adore lightly sweetened rice cakes.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, perhaps no study will convince a chocolate-crazed
country that there is not something powerfully druglike in its
favorite sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Dr. Paul Rozin and colleagues at the University
of Pennsylvania published a study in which they gave chocolate
lovers packets of items to eat when they experienced a craving.
Sometimes the packets contained regular chocolate, sometimes white
chocolate (which does not contain the pharmacologically active
elements in chocolate) and sometimes a tasteless gelatin capsule
filled with cocoa.
</P>
<P>
   If those powerful chemicals are what chocolate lovers crave,
then the tasteless capsules should satisfy the cravings, but they
do not. Even white chocolate did a better job of satisfying
cravings than the capsules. Yet in spite of this convincing study,
researchers have continued to chemically dissect chocolate in
search of its magic.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, none of this comes as a surprise to the average
chocolate addict. She could have told you that a gelatin capsule
was not going to do the trick. She could have told you she does not
crave chocolate for its mind-altering chemicals. For the
dyed-in-the-cocoa chocoholic, the not-very-secret secret is simply
that chocolate tastes very, very good.

HOUSTON INVENTOR EXPECTS TO CATCH HEAT FOR `CHILDPROOF' GUN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Conn.) 
 
By DEBORAH TEDFORD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A Houston inventor is on the verge of being the first
to mass-market a ``childproof'' shotgun, a technological
achievement that could land him in a cross-fire between the
firearms industry and gun-control proponents.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Pugh said the Smart Gun, which can be fired only by an
authorized user, will save lives. The shotgun will be on the market
``very soon'' through Connecticut-based gun maker O.F. Mossberg &AMP;
Sons, and a revolver is available for purchase now in limited
quantities, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids don't need to get killed with guns,'' he said,
adding that he has back orders for his original ``smart'' .357
Magnum. ``A child can never use this gun, and if someone steals it
from your house, it's useless.''
</P>
<P>
   Pugh said he approached a major gun maker with his invention in
the early 1990s, but the company didn't want to pay for a license
to use it. Now he figures he'll become a target of industry ire as
a growing number of lawsuits challenge the decision by gun makers
not to use lifesaving technology on firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This technology has been available for years,'' he said,
adding that he expects attorneys for those suing to take
depositions from him to help their cases.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans was the first municipality to fire a shot against
Smith &AMP; Wesson Corp., Sturm, Ruger &AMP; Co., Beretta USA, Colt
Manufacturing Co. and 18 other makers and distributors in a lawsuit
filed Oct. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleges that gun makers have technology that would
make it impossible for a gun to be used by an unauthorized user _
such as a child or thief. Their failure to utilize lifesaving
technology makes guns ``unreasonably dangerous'' under state law,
the city contends.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from victories against Big Tobacco, as many as 50
municipalities are expected to follow New Orleans' lead. Chicago
has already filed suit, and officials in Miami-Dade County, Fla.,
and Bridgeport, Conn., have announced they will file suit this
week. Atlanta officials have said they, too, will go to court.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Mossberg, a major gun maker and co-inventor of the
``smart shotgun,'' said the Smart Gun is an improved version of
Pugh's earlier design for handguns. It is even sophisticated enough
to pass the military specifications for a standard firearm, he
asserted.
</P>
<P>
   However, he does not believe gun makers should be required to
include the safety feature on all firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this technology has advantages and disadvantages,''
based upon who is using it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a Missouri police officer, Pugh was moved to develop
a firearm that would not shoot its owner after reading about a San
Antonio, Texas, officer killed with his own gun during a traffic
stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept thinking that it didn't have to happen,'' he said. ``I
had never even owned a handgun, so I went out and bought one. I sat
up for two days taking it apart and putting it together until I got
it not to fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Pugh said he crafted the prototype out of odds and ends from his
garage and was granted a patent for the Smart Safety Revolver in
May 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Mum on details due to a secrecy agreement with Mossberg, Pugh
said the principle is similar to that used in the revolver.
</P>
<P>
   On the handgun, the trigger will only respond when activated by
a magnet imbedded in a ring that is worn by the owner.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent a child or other unauthorized person from putting on
the ring and pulling the trigger, the handgun also has a customized
grip, fitted to its owner's hand, that prevents unauthorized people
from firing it.
</P>
<P>
   Pugh said the magnetic strip in the gun, which is similar to the
magnetic strip on a credit card, can be fitted into a wedding band,
class ring or any other ring.
</P>
<P>
   Pugh estimated that the ``smart gun'' feature adds about $150 to
the price of a quality revolver. The sale price for the handgun
ranges from $700-$1,200, depending upon how fancy the trim and
grip.
</P>
<P>
   Pugh expects that the ``smart shotgun'' will be popular among
gun novices, who want a firearm for protection but aren't
proficient at using one.
</P>
<P>
   Pugh said he even has plans for a personalized 9 mm
semiautomatic. ``I don't personally like semiautomatics, but the
market does,'' he said.

FANNIE MAE TRIMS HOME-BUYING COSTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA YIP 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Private mortgage insurance is one of the more annoying aspects
of being a homeowner.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance, which can add as much as $62 a month to the
monthly payment, pays the lender if the borrower defaults.
</P>
<P>
   Lenders typically require mortgage insurance for borrowers who
make down payments of less than 20 percent of the home price.
</P>
<P>
   In order to reduce the cost of financing a home for families
unable to make a large down payment, Fannie Mae, a congressionally
chartered, publicly traded company, has unveiled a new program to
cut mortgage insurance costs.
</P>
<P>
   The impact is potentially far-reaching because Fannie Mae is the
largest source of home mortgage funds in the United States. The
company buys home mortgages from lenders and then resells them to
investors as mortgage-backed bonds.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HERE'S WHO'S ELIGIBLE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae's program, which begins in early March, applies only
to 30-year fixed-rate mortgages. Lenders offering the program will
be limited to those using Fannie Mae's automated software loan
review system called Desktop Underwriter.
</P>
<P>
   The software is better able to quickly assess a borrower's
creditworthiness. Because it's able to spot those who are less
likely to walk out on their mortgage, Fannie Mae doesn't have to
require that they carry as much mortgage insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowers recommended for approval qualify for two options to
reduce their mortgage insurance costs.
</P>
<P>
   Qualified borrowers get the first option automatically. It
reduces the amount of coverage a borrower would have to buy on a
30-year fixed-rate loan.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae currently requires borrowers who come up with only a
5 percent down payment to carry mortgage insurance that covers 30
percent of the value of the loan.
</P>
<P>
   Under the reduced mortgage insurance program, they would have to
buy mortgage insurance coverage equal to 25 percent of the loan
amount, the same level that Fannie Mae required in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   If you are putting down 10 percent, the required coverage will
be cut from 25 percent to 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Under this option, home buyers who put 5 percent down on a
$100,000 mortgage are expected to save at least $110 a year on
mortgage insurance or $1,100 over the first 10 years of the loan,
Fannie Mae officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Those with a 10 percent down payment on that same mortgage are
expected to save at least $130 a year or $1,200 over the duration
of the mortgage insurance coverage, which in this example would be
about 9 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SECOND OPTION SAVES MORE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Qualified borrowers may reduce their mortgage insurance costs
further by choosing the second option offered by Fannie Mae.
</P>
<P>
   Under this option, borrowers may lower the cost of mortgage
insurance even more by choosing to make an additional one-time
payment at closing or going with a higher interest rate on their
mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   If paid at closing, the cost will be about $750 on a $100,000
loan with a 5 percent down payment and about $375 on a loan with a
10 percent down payment.
</P>
<P>
   This approach could save borrowers up to $2,250 over the first
10 years of the mortgage, according to Fannie Mae.
</P>
<P>
   This may look like a good deal, but how many people have $750
left at closing, especially people who are putting 5 percent down?
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people are scrounging for cash,'' said J. Mike Perkins, a
loan officer at PNC Mortgage Corporation of America in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   He said it would take you about four years to recoup that $750.
If you move and sell your house before the four years is up, that
$750 is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowers choosing a lower premium by agreeing to a higher
mortgage rate would see an increase in their rate of about 0.15
percent on a loan with 5 percent down and about 0.08 percent on a
loan with 10 percent down.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowers choosing that option and putting 5 percent down would
save about $1,800 over the first 10 years of the mortgage. Those
putting 10 percent down would save about $1,100 over the first 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners wanting to refinance their mortgage may apply for the
program only if Fannie Mae has purchased their loan from their
lender. To find out if you can apply for the program, ask the firm
that collects your mortgage payments whether Fannie Mae has bought
your mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is you have to have pristine credit in order to
qualify for this program.
</P>
<P>
   To get a list of Fannie Mae lenders in the Houston area that use
Desktop Underwriter or for more information on the mortgage
insurance program, call 800-732-6643.

NEW SUPERVISOR HAS FIRSTHAND VIEW OF PROBLEMS

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The newest member of the Board of Supervisors
represents two of San Francisco's frustrated constituencies on
their own level: she is a renter and relies on public
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Alicia Becerril, who was sworn in Sunday, represents areas that
are two of Mayor Willie Browns thorniest problems _ the high cost
of residential property and the municipal transit system.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a tenant in our city and does not own a car, providing
her with invaluable insight into the matters of public
transportation and renters' concerns _ two issues that resonate
greatly among all us in San Francisco,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Becerril wasted no time in pressing the point. Among her first
public comments after taking office, she said, ``I've got a long
history in San Francisco as a tenant and as a user of mass
transportation.''
</P>
<P>
   Renters have proved to be one of the city's most important
voting blocs. Some tenant activists have said Brown hasn't done
enough to protect them from escalating rents and increasing
evictions in one of the tightest and most expensive housing markets
in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Brown appointed Becerril to replace Jose Medina, who left the
board last week to run the California Department of Public
Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Ammiano, the president of the Board of Supervisors, wasn't
surprised that transportation and rent carried a lot of weight in
Brown's appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a little bit of an outreach effort for him
because he's been criticized some in those areas,'' said Ammiano,
who also uses the transit system.
</P>
<P>
   Becerril, 49, resigned her post as vice president of the Board
of Permit Appeals to take her new job. She started with the Brown
administration in 1997 on the Landmarks Preservation Advisory
Board.
</P>
<P>
   Becerril is lawyer with the firm of Gutierrez &AMP; Associates,
where she focuses on commercial litigation, product liability,
employment law and personal injury.

SCOURING SPACE FOR DUST  
 LOOKING FOR E.T.  
 BIRD METABOLISM STUDIED
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Space may look pristine, but the part of it near Earth, at
least, is really quite trashy. In orbit is the weightless flotsam
of human exploration _ a used package of Tang here, a spent rocket
stage there _ as well as enough dust to make a housekeeper weep.
</P>
<P>
   The larger debris is generally accounted for and tracked, for
even a lost spacesuit glove whizzing along at an orbital speed of
17,000 miles an hour can damage a satellite or other object in its
path. But dust bombardment can cause damage as well, and less is
known about the scope of the dust problem.
</P>
<P>
   An instrument being carried aboard an unclassified Air Force
satellite is designed to get some answers. The experiment, kind of
a white-glove test in space, will measure the mass and speed of
individual dust particles, as well as their trajectory, in order to
determine their origin and distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Some dust particles are left behind by comets; others are the
result of human activity. And by continually colliding with and
abrading larger orbiting objects, dust begets more dust.
</P>
<P>
   Speed is an indicator of origin, as cometary dust travels faster
than the human variety _ about 25,000 miles an hour. But the
experiment, designed and monitored by scientists at the University
of Chicago, should also be able to determine whether the dust is
uniformly distributed, or concentrated in clouds. It may even
discover that the Earth has a dust ring, like a junior version of
Saturn.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   The search for extraterrestrial intelligence, or SETI, has
usually involved the ears, not the eyes. Most such projects collect
and analyze radio emissions from the heavens for patterns or other
signs that may indicate an alien origin.
</P>
<P>
   There have always been a few diehards, however, who have argued
that an otherworldly civilization may be just as likely to use
light waves as a means of signaling their existence to the rest of
the universe.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some of these proponents argue, given Earth's
technological history, an advanced civilization may be more likely
to use a laser, say, than a more-primitive radio transmitter.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Planetary Society, a nonprofit group that has long
backed the hunt for alien life, is sponsoring three new optical
SETI programs. Two projects _ one at the University of California
at Berkeley, the other at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
Astrophysics _ are looking for very brief light pulses from nearby
Sun-like stars.
</P>
<P>
   The third project, also at Berkeley, is examining data from
several observatories' searches for planets outside the solar
system in the hope of finding a steady, extremely narrow-frequency
beam of light.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Yet another animal has been trained to run on a treadmill in the
name of science. A few months ago it was a wallaby, bouncing around
with an ersatz baby in its pouch. This time it is the rhea, a
flightless bird, which suffered the further indignity of wearing a
clear plastic hood while it ran.
</P>
<P>
   But it was all for a good cause: determining the maximum
metabolic rate for a bird, which until now had not been done. The
results, according to the Swiss and American researchers who
conducted the study, are astounding. The rhea, pretty much an avian
couch potato, has a maximum metabolic rate that is 36 times its
resting rate, an increase that exceeds that for most mammals.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, who discussed their results in the journal
Nature, suggest that the scope of the rhea's metabolic increase is
representative of birds in general. (The minimum increase required
for flight, they note, is 15 times the resting rate.)
</P>
<P>
   The rhea's performance is all the more amazing given the size of
its lungs, about half that of a mammal of the same weight. This
supports the belief that bird lungs are far more efficient than
those of mammals.

CHILD'S MOVEMENTS MAY OFFER AN EARLY CLUE TO AUTISM 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The discovery that autistic children appear to have subtle
abnormalities in body movements that can be diagnosed as early as 3
months old is leading researchers to hope for new treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, by Philip Teitelbaum, a psychologist at the
University of Florida in Gainesville, are preliminary. But they
have generated intense interest because for the first time, a
method is being proposed for diagnosing the condition in babies
whose brains are still developing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Most autism is not diagnosed in children until they are at least
3 years old. But if there were a reliable way to diagnose autism
earlier, Teitelbaum and other researchers said, doctors might be
able to devise therapies to alleviate or eliminate the condition,
when the brain is its most malleable.
</P>
<P>
   Autism is a disorder of the brain and behavior that affects
about 5 of every 10,000 children. While autistic children appear
healthy, they may stare into space for hours, throw tantrums, show
no interest in people and pursue repetitive activities, like head
banging, with no apparent purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum made the discovery by examining videotapes of babies
who were later found to be autistic. These infants showed a
specific cluster of movement abnormalities when rolling over,
sitting up, crawling and walking, Teitelbaum said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   But, he cautioned, the results are still preliminary.
Researchers need to look at many more babies, he said, to see
exactly which movement abnormalities can predict autism and which
suggest developmental disorders like schizophrenia or attention
deficit disorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's on to something,'' said Dr. Dan Geschwind, a
neurogeneticist at the University of California at Los Angeles and
scientific adviser to Cure Autism Now, an organization based in Los
Angeles run by parents of autistic children. ``He's got a very
intriguing piece of preliminary data which, if it turns out to be
true, will be very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Temple Grandin, a highly functioning autistic woman who is an
assistant professor of animal science at Colorado State University
in Fort Collins and an authority on animal behavior, said: ``He's
on to something really good, and I fully support it. I like the
fact that he is objectively measuring something that is
biological.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be, she cautioned, that Teitelbaum has discovered general
problems in the nervous system that are not unique to autism. But
even that, she said, is a benefit for doctors, parents and
teachers, who now have nothing to go on before children are 2 or 3
years old.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Donnellan, a professor of rehabilitation psychology and
special education at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, said:
``Teitelbaum's work is important because it reflects a reality
about autism that has been missed. We tend to think it's a problem
with the mind. But now that we are really beginning to see how the
brain works, we know that the mind is embodied. Body is part of
mind and there's no way to separate them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Teitelbaum said he got the idea of looking at autism as a
movement disorder partly because of his work with brain-damaged
animals. As they recover, he said, they go through predictable
stages, for example recovery of movement, that reflect fundamental
aspects of brain organization. Because human babies also pass
through predictable stages of development, he theorized that
defects in the brain might be reflected in early movements.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Teitelbaum sent out word to parents of autistic
children through various national organizations that he was looking
for videotapes of babies before their autism was diagnosed. He
received 17 tapes that showed the babies during major milestones of
motor development, including rolling over, sitting, crawling,
standing and walking.
</P>
<P>
   He also videotaped 15 normal infants as they passed through the
same milestones. Portions of each tape were analyzed, using a
special technique, for subtle differences in patterns of movement.
</P>
<P>
   No two babies develop motor skills in exactly the same way, but
the autistic babies show a specific cluster of movement
abnormalities, Teitelbaum said. Some were subtle and others quite
obvious. Normal children may temporarily show some of the same
movements.
</P>
<P>
   For example, none of the autistic babies in the tapes learned to
roll over like normal children did, he said. Normal babies use a
corkscrew motion to go from back to stomach or vice versa. Starting
at about 3 months old, they first turn their pelvis to one side,
followed by the trunk and finally the shoulders and head. By 6
months, the order is reversed: the head goes first and the rest of
the body parts follow, corkscrew fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the autistic babies in the tapes never learned to roll
over. Others did, but in a peculiar fashion, Teitelbaum said.
Starting from lying on their sides, they rolled to their stomachs
or backs by raising heads and pelvises. Then they threw the upper
legs forward and toppled over, moving all body segments together.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike healthy babies who usually learn to sit up at 6
months, even while turning the torso or head, some of the infants
whose autism was diagnosed later on toppled easily, falling to one
side ``like a log'' and failing to break the falls with their
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum, who described his findings in a recent issue of the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, also noted
anomalies in the way the autistic babies in the tapes learned to
crawl and walk.
</P>
<P>
   Babies typically start to crawl at about the same time they
begin to sit, holding their bodies symmetrically with arms vertical
at shoulder width, palms on floor, fingers pointed forward. Thighs
are vertical and hip-width apart with knees on the ground and lower
legs and feet resting on the floor pointing backward. Weight is
commonly distributed equally on all four limbs.
</P>
<P>
   The autistic children in the study showed an asymmetrical lack
of support in the arms or legs, Teitelbaum said. One baby supported
himself on his forearms rather than his hands. He raised his pelvis
high in the air, bird-dog fashion, but could not move forward.
Another baby crawled by scooting his left knee on the floor but
used his right foot to push himself forward.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum said that every autistic child showed some degree of
asymmetry in walking. Many tended to shift their weight at the
wrong moment, which made their walking appear slightly stiff.
Others kept their arms in a more infantile position, arms extended
forward. Interestingly, many autistic children walk more slowly and
with shorter steps, like Parkinson's disease patients whose motor
skills are damaged, Teitelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Early diagnosis has long been a goal of autism researchers, who
theorize that the condition results from brain abnormalities that
develop before birth. Some researchers think the glitch occurs as
early as the 20th to 24th day of gestation, long before women know
they are pregnant. Others believe the injury, which could be a
mutation or environmental insult, occurs later on, perhaps in the
second trimester of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, researchers say that in autistic people, most of
the brain forms normally but that some basic scaffolding of nerve
fibers is incomplete or improperly developed. Because the human
brain grows rapidly in the first year of life _ literally
constructing circuits that will last a lifetime _ this is the best
time to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of intervention would be to stimulate the baby's brain
to circumvent the bad wiring or develop connections to compensate
for a defect, Donnellan said. By correcting movements through some
form of physical therapy, it may be possible to used feedback to
help correct abnormal brain development.

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Imagine that you could buy your own jet airplane _ not
a little jet airplane, but a big jet airplane, just for you.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a cramped seat that tilts back only part way, you
could put in a whole bedroom, just for you. On those long flights
over the Pacific, you could slip under the covers, shut the door,
and really go to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of freshening up with hot towels, you could freshen up
with a hot shower _ in your own bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   These are the kind of choices open to people who can spend $38
million to $45 million on a top-of-the-line, long-distance business
jet.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a big market. But it's bigger than it used to be, and
it grows every decade. In the 1990s, the emergence of a time-share
market in jet aircraft has increased it substantially. A few years
ago, the large corporate jet market had essentially one company:
Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. of Savannah, Ga. It now has four
companies with similar-priced offerings: Gulfstream, Bombardier,
Airbus and Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   For Seattle, the rivalry between these four has a special
relevance. Boeing, which butters its bread by pleasing airlines,
faces a wholly different kind of customer with different priorities
and a different menu of airplanes to choose from. Boeing has chosen
to pursue these customers in a different way _ different from
Airbus, and different from itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing Co. got into this market because of a dinner between
Chairman Phil Condit and a frustrated customer. The customer was
Jack Welch, chief executive of General Electric Corp. Welch had
gotten tired of flying long distances in cramped jets, and had
bought a couple of Boeing 737-600s.
</P>
<P>
   He liked them fine except for one aggravation: They didn't go
far enough. Their range was 3,000 miles _ OK for some airlines, but
not for Jack Welch.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's Borge Boeskov, who tells the story, came up with a
hybrid product: a 737-700 body with 737-800 wing, engines and
landing gear, and with extra fuel tanks. It's the Boeing Business
Jet _ the BBJ _ a program run by Boeskov, a longtime Boeing man who
had worked on Air Force One. General Electric came in as a minority
partner, and the plane has General Electric engines on it.
</P>
<P>
   Who buys such a jet? Mostly it's customers who don't want their
names in the newspaper. They come in three groups. The first is
Fortune 100 corporations like GE. These are half the market, and in
the long run probably more than half. The second, 20 percent of the
market, is countries the size of Poland or Mexico, who don't want
to pay $250 million for a Boeing 747 but need an ``Air Force One''
that can move their president with dignity and security, and
without having to refuel in some politically inconvenient country.
</P>
<P>
   The final group is the seriously rich, the Paul Allens and Greg
Normans of the world. ``They may have a board of directors,''
Boeskov says, ``but they don't ask them about anything. They do
what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Selling to these buyers is far different from selling to an
airline. The airline sees only an economic machine. It studies
costs down to the penny. Corporate buyers consider costs, but look
more at the mission. All the buyers in this market are presumed to
have planes already, and people to maintain and fly them. Boeing
advertises the BBJ not in publications for rich people, like the
Robb Report, but in publications like Professional Pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Individual buyers read up on the jet and listen to what their
pilots say, but in the end they make a personal decision. ``There's
an incredible amount of peer pressure,'' particularly among
entrepreneurs, to have the newest and neatest machine, says the
BBJ's top salesman, Lee Monsen.
</P>
<P>
   Monsen says you can't always tell who these rich people are.
When he was selling planes for Gulfstream, a man about 35 wearing
jeans, gold chains and a ponytail came in, looked briefly at a jet,
and wrote out a personal check for $11 million. Monsen was
doubtful, and he checked with the bank.
</P>
<P>
   No, there weren't funds in the account. Yes, the bank would
cover it. Ponytail was an heir to a fortune in uranium mining.
</P>
<P>
   In the corporate jet business, says Monsen, if a prospect says
he's rich, assume he is. ``You kiss a few frogs,'' he says, ``and
some of them turn into princes.''
</P>
<P>
   In entering this market, Boeing and Airbus have a huge advantage
over Gulfstream and Bombardier: The 737 and the A-319 were
developed for the commercial market. Boeing is rolling out its
new-generation 737s at 24 per month. It has huge economies of
scale. It would be like General Motors developing an RV version of
its buses and putting it up against Winnebago.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing and Airbus thus cost only a bit more than the Gulfstream
and Bombardier planes, but are three times as roomy inside. They
make the most of it. One Boeing sales presentation is to take
prospective customers through a Gulfstream-Bombardier fuselage, and
then through a fuselage of the BBJ, and ask: ``In which would you
rather spend a 14-hour flight?''
</P>
<P>
   The two smaller rivals don't take this sitting down. William
Boisture, president and chief executive of Gulfstream says, ``The
BBJ wins on one parameter, and that's size.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gulfstream 5, produced by a publicly traded company with
7,000 employees, is the culmination of a family of jets that have
long been considered the Rolls-Royce of the air. The G-5 is sleeker
than the BBJ, and burns fuel at about half the rate. It flies
higher and can go a few hundred miles farther, and because it's
half the weight, it can take off and land on smaller runways.
</P>
<P>
   Boisture says the G-5 can use 85 percent of the world airports
in the Boeing Airport Database. ``The BBJ can use less than 25
percent of the airports in that database,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   To some users, that makes the difference. When golf pro Greg
Norman ordered a BBJ, Boeing put him in ads. Norman was designing
golf courses all over East Asia and wanted a BBJ for those 14-hour
flights across the Pacific. But the Asian market dried up, and
Norman's business switched to rural areas in North America served
by tiny airports. The BBJ can't get into Aspen, Colo., and Sun
Valley, Idaho. In November, Norman canceled his BBJ order.
</P>
<P>
   Two other rivals are on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus Industrie, based in Tolouse, France, is familiar to those
who know Boeing. The A-319 Corporate Jet is similar to the BBJ. It
is slightly roomier, being 7 inches wider at the floor. It claims
slightly more range than the BBJ, which the BBJ plans to offset by
using winglets. The A-319 could conceivably counter with its own
winglets, but has not.
</P>
<P>
   The A-319 offers a special ``double bogey'' landing gear that
allows it to use more airports than the BBJ _ but the landing gear
adds weight.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial airliners tend to hold their value longer than
corporate jets. Airbus says it will have the best resale value
because the A-319 is an off-the-shelf model while the BBJ's
wings-and-fuselage combo makes it, in the words of Airbus
spokeswoman Mary Anne Greczyn, ``a mutt.''
</P>
<P>
   The BBJ's Monsen says he doubts that anyone would rip out the
custom-made, $6 million to $12 million interiors of either of these
jets to convert them to commercial airliners. But it could be done
on the BBJ as easily as the Airbus, he says. To an airline, the BBJ
would be ``a 737-700 with a few hundred extra pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   To Monsen, an important difference between Boeing and Airbus is
in the organization of sales and service. Boeing Business Jets has
its own office, at Boeing Field; unlike the rest of the company,
the 35 employees don't wear badges. Monsen sells nothing but BBJs.
(He's not paid on commission.) Airbus North America has two
salesmen who work the A-319, but they also sell cargo planes.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth contender is Bombardier Aerospace. Based in Montreal,
Canada, Bombardier (pronounced bom-BAR-dee-ay) has about one-fifth
the employee base of Boeing but seven times that of Gulfstream.
Bombardier, whose stock is traded on the Toronto exchange, has
47,000 employees, 19,000 of them in the United States. It owns
Learjet. Its Global Express is the direct rival of the Gulfstream
5.
</P>
<P>
   But while the G-5's design is an evolution of the G-4, the
Global Express was designed from scratch. ``Everyone else,
including Gulfstream, Boeing and Airbus, has taken an existing
airplane and tried to modify it for this mission,'' says Bombardier
spokesman Leo Knaapen. ``We spent the money and time to get it
right.''
</P>
<P>
   The pride of the Global Express is its wing, which has a
35-degree sweep-back similar to the wing on the smaller Cessna
Citation 10, the fastest corporate jet on the market. While Global
Express has the same engine as the G-5, the plane, though bigger
and heavier, cruises slightly faster (see chart). Also, its wing
has full leading-edge slats, which it says allows it to get in and
out of more airports than even the G-5 can.
</P>
<P>
   Gulfstream chief executive Boisture sniffs at all the high-tech
talk. ``We both beat the subject to death,'' he says. What counts
is what a plane can do. ``And when you're on an airport in
Kazakhstan, the fewer moving parts the better.''
</P>
<P>
   The test pilot for Aviation Week magazine, David North,
concluded in the Aug. 17, 1998, issue that the Global Express ``has
some advantages over the G-5,'' but predicts that the outcome in
the market will be based much on company loyalty, and ``will come
close to a tie.''
</P>
<P>
   Gulfstream was the first of the four in the market, and beat
Bombardier by two years. It had sold 106 G-5s by Sept. 30. The
customer for the 100th airplane was Microsoft's chief of research,
Nathan Myhrvold.
</P>
<P>
   Bombardier will deliver its first Global Express this spring,
and Knaapen says the company has more than 80 firm orders.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus expects to deliver its first A-319 corporate jet this
year, and perhaps one more. It has just 12 ``commitments,'' and
only some of those are firm orders.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, when it announced the BBJ, told the press it expected to
sell 10 planes a year. Internally, it planned for six. The company
had done no study _ unusual for Boeing, which studies everything.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing delivered eight BBJs in 1998. It plans to deliver 29 this
year and 25 next year. It has 46 firm orders.
</P>
<P>
   As to the future, Gulfstream foresees a market of 400 to 500
airplanes over the next 10 years, and expects to get half. ``We
have more than 50 percent of the market right now,'' says Boisture.
</P>
<P>
   Bombardier foresees a market of 500 to 800 planes over the next
15 to 20 years, and expects to get half of that.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing projects a market of 600 over the next 10 years, and
expects 40 percent _ 24 planes per year.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus foresees a submarket of about 24 per year of
Airbus-Boeing-sized planes _ 240 over 10 years _ and expects to get
half of that.
</P>
<P>
   Readers who have been doing their math will note that the
various competitors have laid claim to about 160 percent of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's the airplane business.

 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By shining ultraviolet light on the fossil of a baby dinosaur
that had collected dust in a file drawer in Italy for 15 years,
paleontologists have discovered astonishingly well-preserved
anatomical details that have rekindled one of the most intense
debates in paleobiology.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery has cast doubt on two widely held theories: that
dinosaurs were warmblooded and that they were the ancestors of
birds.
</P>
<P>
   Many paleontologists in recent years have come to accept the
theory that at least some dinosaurs could maintain steady body
temperatures by themselves. Many paleontologists are also convinced
that birds are closely related to dinosaurs, probably as their
direct descendants. Part of the evidence for this is the striking
similarity of the skeletons of some dinosaurs to those of birds.
</P>
<P>
   The baby dinosaur recently examined was first found embedded in
a limestone formation north of Naples in 1983. Last year, after its
rediscovery in the Archeological Administration in Salerno,
paleontologists who examined it were astonished to find that much
of its flesh, including many of its internal organs, had been
preserved in fossil form _ an extraordinary discovery. The unique
fossilized dinosaur, named Scipionyx samniticus, has by far the
best preserved fossil organs of any dinosaur ever found, scientists
agree.
</P>
<P>
   Since the initial investigation, which was reported a year ago,
a team of paleontologists headed by Dr. John A. Ruben of Oregon
State University at Corvallis and Dr. Willem J. Hillenius of the
College of Charleston, in South Carolina, has examined the fossil
under ultraviolet radiation. On Friday, the journal Science
published the result: a spectacular picture in fluorescing colors,
in which the little animal's organs stand out as vividly as
color-coded engineering diagrams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' said Dr. Larry Martin, a paleontologist at the
University of Kansas. ``It's essentially a dinosaur that's been
dissected.''
</P>
<P>
   Paleontologists who have seen the ultraviolet pictures of
Scipionyx agree that they are uniquely revealing. But experts are
far from agreeing on the interpretation of the images.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben and his colleagues argue that the fossil provides strong
evidence that dinosaurs had a breathing mechanism similar to that
of modern crocodiles and completely different from that of birds.
From this and some other evidence, they deduced that theropod
(``beast footed'') dinosaurs, including the mighty Tyrannosaurus
rex, were coldblooded, but were capable of spurts of intense
activity.
</P>
<P>
   A member of Ruben's group, Nicholas R. Geist, said, ``What you
have is a turbocharged reptile.''
</P>
<P>
   Scipionyx, which in life probably somewhat resembled the fierce
velociraptors depicted in the movie ``Jurassic Park,'' lived about
110 million years ago. This specimen, an infant that apparently
died shortly after it was hatched, failed to attract much
scientific interest at the time it was found.
</P>
<P>
   But it was later discovered that its different body parts were
selectively mineralized by different chemicals in the marine
sediments in which it was buried. This causes the fossilized organs
to fluoresce in different colors when exposed to ultraviolet.
</P>
<P>
   The animal's colon glows bright yellow and appears to lie very
close to its spinal column. In modern reptiles, the colon is
arranged like this only in crocodiles, Ruben said.
</P>
<P>
   In another possible similarity with crocodiles, scientists found
evidence in the infant dinosaur of a specialized breathing device
called a hepatic piston. In the crocodile, Ruben said, the piston
is a large liver driven by muscles that pull it in and out to move
air through the lungs. The colon lies near the crocodile's spine to
leave room for the liver to move freely.
</P>
<P>
   Scipionyx's lungs themselves were not preserved, but Ruben
identified a large organ that glows blue under ultraviolet light as
its liver. The relative positions and sizes of these and other
organs mark them as crocodilian in type, he said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Ruben said, a bird's colon extends right through
the middle of its abdominal cavity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems clear,'' he said in an interview, ``that a bird's
radically different system of breathing, in which air is
continuously drawn through its lungs, could not have evolved from
the hepatic-piston system we see in this theropod dinosaur.''
</P>
<P>
   The indications, however faint, that Scipionyx had diaphragmatic
muscles to assist its liver piston in breathing suggest that the
animal may have been an ectotherm (coldblooded), but was capable of
sustaining oxygen consumption rates and activity levels beyond
those of modern reptiles, Ruben said.
</P>
<P>
   These views were strongly endorsed by Dr. Alan Feduccia, an
ornithologist at the University of North Carolina, who has long
argued that birds could not have descended from dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think John Ruben has done a remarkable job _ a nice piece of
detective work on a beautiful specimen,'' Feduccia said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Lawrence Witmer, an evolutionary biologist at Ohio
University's College of Osteopathic Medicine, in Athens, Ohio, was
one of the experts who challenged Ruben's conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a ton of evidence for the view that birds descended
from theropod dinosaurs, and John Ruben's conclusions fly in the
face of this abundant evidence,'' Witmer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He raises some intriguing points,'' he added, ``but I'm not
convinced that we're really seeing a hepatic piston in this fossil.
Remember, we're seeing it in crushed form. Also, how do we know
that bird breathing systems could not have evolved from
crocodilelike systems? The history of life has often confounded
theory.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Ruben's ideas might turn out to be correct, but
that further evidence was needed to settle some large doubts.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, of the University of Kansas, suggested, however, that
the evidence already appeared to be in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the conclusions of the Oregon State University team,
he said: ``There's actually no way they could be wrong about this.
The Scipionyx specimen has the best preservation ever seen. It's
one of the biggest discoveries of this decade. It tells us more
about dinosaurs than any other specimen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The positions of the dinosaur's windpipe and colon serve as
independent checks that the animal did not have a bird's breathing
apparatus,'' he said. And, he said, the external shape of theropod
dinosaurs, ``with deep, narrow body walls, is exactly the design
you would expect for an animal with a hepatic piston.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the scientists who hold to the bird-dinosaur connection,
he said: ``They're really cast in stone. Despite this new evidence,
it's going to be very hard for them to change their minds now.''

   One more option for toppling Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq is

   &UR; GRAY DAWN: THE GLOBAL AGING CRISIS &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   (1,500 words) The world's population is getting older. Over the
next few decades, rich countries will experience an unprecedented
growth in the number of their elderly and an unprecedented decline
in the number of their youth. Yet in the poor nations, population
is growing. This may do more to change our future than deadly
superviruses, extreme climate change or the spread of nuclear,
biological and chemical weapons.

   (1,200 words) Today Russia is closer to bloody conflict than it
ever has been since the terrible civil war of 1918-20. For 70
years, the Soviet Union operated a strong state apparatus, anchored
by the KGB and the Communist Party. Now its disintegration has
created a power vacuum that has yet to be filled.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is an idea that women find either irresistible, or
unbearable: a computer program that estimates a woman's personal
risk of developing breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The software, called the ``breast cancer risk tool,'' or ``risk
disk,'' was issued last fall by the National Cancer Institute, and
can be obtained by calling (800) 4-CANCER or by requesting it from
the institute's Web site at cancertrials.nci.nih.gov. The institute
recommends that women go over their results with a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   The software computes the risk of developing breast cancer,
first within the next five years, and then over the course of a
lifetime. The answers are compared with the numbers for someone who
has no risk factors for the disease, and who is the same age as the
woman using the software.
</P>
<P>
   The software was originally developed to help determine whether
a woman had a high enough risk to make it worth taking the drug
tamoxifen, which can reduce the risk of breast cancer by about 50
percent in high-risk women.
</P>
<P>
   The program bases its calculations on six questions: a woman's
age, the age at which she began menstruating, the age when she
first gave birth, the number of breast cancers in her mother and
sisters, the number of breast biopsies she has had, the biopsy
results and the woman's race.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a reasonable estimate of risk, researchers say,
though they said the program omits some essential questions, which
might result in an underestimate of risk for some women in
high-risk families. For instance, the program does not take into
account the age of onset of breast cancer among relatives, or the
history of breast cancer in the father's side of the family, which
may be important in families carrying genes for breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kathy Helzlsouer of Johns Hopkins University described a
case in which the disk indicated a relatively low risk for a woman
whose mother had had breast cancer. But the woman's grandmother,
and six of the grandmother's sisters, had also had the disease. The
program was not designed to identify those cases, which Dr.
Helzlsouer said indicated a much higher risk.
</P>
<P>
   Other doctors also said that risk assessments carried out in
person went into more detail. When women who are worried about
developing breast cancer consult Dr. Patricia Ganz, who heads a
program for high-risk women at the Jonsson Cancer Center at the
University of California at Los Angeles, she discusses the factors
on the software, but others as well, such as being overweight and
drinking alcohol regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Obesity, regular alcohol consumption, early menstruation and
late or no childbearing all heighten risk by increasing lifetime
exposure to estrogen, which can stimulate the growth of malignant
cells in the breast.
</P>
<P>
   Some risk factors can be modified, Dr. Ganz said: women can
exercise and try to stay lean, and cut back on alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   For women who want to take replacement estrogen to quell hot
flashes, insomnia and other symptoms of menopause, Dr. Ganz said
studies had indicated that using the hormone for less than five
years did not add substantially to the risk of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But many women may want to take it longer, because it is thought
to protect against heart disease, the leading killer of women, and
the bone-weakening disease osteoporosis. These women must weigh
these benefits against the added breast cancer risk of long-term
use.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ganz said she recommended that women at high risk for breast
cancer take other drugs to lower cholesterol or prevent bone loss.
But it is not known if the other drugs work as well as estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   But some risk factors cannot be changed, and when a woman's risk
is unusually high, doctors recommend more frequent breast
examinations and mammograms, in hope of detecting tumors early
enough to cure them. Extra monitoring is especially important for
women with strong family histories of the disease, and those who
have had a positive test for a mutation in the genes BRCA1 or
BRCA2, which can produce a lifetime breast cancer risk as high as
50 percent to 80 percent. Those women are usually advised to begin
having mammograms at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   Some women from very high-risk families choose to have their
breasts removed prophylactically, and while that is not something
that most doctors encourage, Dr. Ganz said, many will support the
decision if a woman has clearly given it careful consideration. But
removal of the ovaries is often recommended for women who carry
BRCA mutations, because the genes are also associated with ovarian
cancer, which has a much higher death rate than breast cancer.
Removing the ovaries, by reducing estrogen levels, can also help
reduce the risk of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Extra monitoring may also be recommended for women with personal
histories of breast lumps needing biopsies. Even negative biopsies
may increase risk, researchers say, because the need for them may
reflect an underlying problem linked to the tendency to develop
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Pennsylvania, some women at high risk are
being given both mammograms and magnetic resonance imaging scans,
as part of a study to determine whether magnetic imaging can help
doctors interpret suspicious spots that are hard to diagnose on
mammograms.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mitchell Schnall, a radiologist who is conducting the study,
said that the magnetic scans might be able to detect cancers that
mammography missed. But that is not certain, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in the special surveillance program at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York are also beginning to
study magnetic imaging, said Dr. Alexandra Heerdt, a breast surgeon
who directs the program.

   She said one of the greatest benefits for women who attended the
clinic was peace of mind. Those with very high risk may be examined
every three months, in addition to having yearly mammograms.
</P>
<P>
   A mammogram looks for changes in the breast only once a year,
Dr. Heerdt said. ``But they could have minimal physical changes
that I could pick up more quickly and readily,'' she said.
``There's less stress because they don't feel that they have to
take on the responsibility of doing all the breast exams in
between. They feel that someone else is bearing the burden with
them.''

<P>
   Despite years of increasing worry and worldwide headlines, the
British government has only now gathered the information it needs
to figure out how ``mad cow disease'' spread through the nation's
dairy herds and apparently cost 35 people their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, a public inquiry by the government concluded the
yearlong fact-finding phase of a nationwide investigation into the
handling of mad cow disease, more properly known as bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, an advisory committee of the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration recommended that the agency consider banning blood
donations from people who have visited Britain since 1980, just in
case the disease could be spread through the donations.
</P>
<P>
   Both the recommendation and the British inquiry have the same
aim: prevention. ``The primary object of this inquiry is not to
attribute blame for what occurred,'' Lord Justice Nicholas Phillips
said as his inquiry began, ``but to identify what went wrong and
why, and to see what lessons can be learnt.''
</P>
<P>
   Colin Blakemore, a professor of physiology at Oxford, called for
the investigation in 1997, when he assumed the presidency of the
British Association for the Advancement of Science. The year
before, Blakemore said: ``We must reform the way in which
scientific advice is given to and interpreted by government
ministers. Time and time again, inappropriate assurances to do with
human health were made by people with no qualification to make
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The British panel will sort through the information it has
gathered and issue conclusions and recommendations in June. In the
process, it is producing a medical detective story of unusual
proportions. Testimony by scientists, veterinarians and doctors who
dealt with the disease has painted a detailed picture of what
happened in the field and in the laboratory as the outbreak took
its course.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillips inquiry has established that the epidemic began 14
years ago. On Dec. 22, 1984, a veterinarian named David Bee was
called to a farm in West Sussex, in southern England, where a dairy
cow known simply as No. 133 was displaying what he described as ``a
variety of unusual clinical manifestations.'' By Feb. 11, 1985, No.
133 was dead, and more cows on the farm were showing symptoms,
including aggression, panic and lack of coordination.
</P>
<P>
   Bee ruled out several possible causes: lead and mercury
poisoning, fungal contamination of the feed container, kidney
parasites. After six more cows on the farm died, the farm owners
agreed to allow another sick animal, No. 142, to be killed so that
an autopsy could be performed by the government. The report came in
on Sept. 19, 1985. The cow's brain was riddled with spongelike
holes, a pathologist at the government's Central Veterinary
Laboratory in Weybridge, Surrey, said. Cow 142 had a ``spongiform
encephalopathy.''
</P>
<P>
   But it took pathologists more than a year to realize that the
spongy-brain disorder was a disease in itself, and not the result
of something else, such as poisoning. By November 1986, the
condition had a name: bovine spongiform encephalopathy, one of a
school of diseases known as transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies, including scrapie, a disorder of sheep, and kuru,
a human disease linked to cannibalism.
</P>
<P>
   By March 1988, the source of bovine spongiform encephalopathy
had been tracked by a Central Veterinary Laboratory epidemiologist
to what Daniel Carleton Gajdusek, a kuru researcher and Nobel
laureate, now calls ``high-tech cannibalism'' _ the use of
performance-enhancing dairy feeds whose protein came from meat and
bone meal from slaughtered sheep and cows. (The practice of
including these ingredients in animal feed is no longer allowed in
the United States.)
</P>
<P>
   The British government quickly announced the formation of a
scientific consultative committee to be led by a professor of
zoology at the University of Oxford, Sir Richard Southwood. This
group recommended that ruminant protein be banned from cattle feed,
and a crucial issue being examined by the inquiry is the efficiency
with which that ban was put into effect.
</P>
<P>
   By fall 1988, people were beginning to wonder if the condition
could spread to people who ate meat from sick animals. As Southwood
recalled for the inquiry, ``From work on scrapie we considered that
the central nervous system and, to a lesser extent, the lymphatic
system were the tissues that would harbor the agent.'' As a result,
a total ban on the use of certain bovine offals, including brain,
thymus and spleen, was announced in June 1989.
</P>
<P>
   British pet food manufacturers had removed these substances from
their dog and cat food a year earlier, but in May 1990, a house cat
came down with a BSE-like disease, followed by a several zoo
animals.
</P>
<P>
   This ominous ``species jump'' prompted another government
action. The Southwood committee had predicted that, should bovine
spongiform encephalopathy erupt in humans, it would ``closely
resemble Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,'' a fatal neurodegenerative
disease that usually strikes the elderly and, like kuru, scrapie
and BSE, is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the first cat died, a unit was set up at Western
General Hospital in Edinburgh to monitor humans for signs of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, in summer 1994, in Wiltshire, the disease
first appeared in a human, when the parents of a Royal Air Force
cadet, Stephen Churchill, noticed that he had slipped behind in
school. Soon he had succumbed to hallucinations. By March 1995, he
was undergoing comprehensive tests at the National Hospital for
Neurology and Neurosurgery in London. There, his mother for the
first time saw a possible diagnosis in a note on his chart:
``CJD?''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Churchill died on May 23, 1995, and by that fall more
young people were found to be stricken with the same illness. Could
the disease be spreading from cows to people? The British
government maintained that beef products were safe. But some
scientists began to contradict this position publicly.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In December 1995, Sir Bernard Tomlinson, a neuropathologist from
Gateshead in northeast England, announced on BBC Radio 4 that he
would not eat beef organs, including calf's liver. The health
secretary at the time, Stephen Dorrell, responded on BBC, saying,
``We have removed from the human food chain the organs that could
conceivably be linked to that,'' and ``There is no conceivable risk
from what is now in the food chain.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, only four months later, on March 20, 1996, Dorrell
read a fateful statement before the House of Commons that 10 young
people had died, and ``the most likely explanation'' was ``exposure
to BSE.'' That day the world learned the name of a new disease: new
variant CJD, or human BSE.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union banned the sale of British beef for three
years, until November 1998. In the meantime, according to Britain's
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, more than 4,347,380
cattle were destroyed, most merely because they were deemed old
enough to conceivably harbor the disease agent. The Ministry of
Agriculture has estimated that the total cost will reach $7.13
billion by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   To date the human death toll stands at 35, with 34 cases in the
United Kingdom and one in France. Scientists who tested tissue
samples at the Neuropathogenesis Unit in Edinburgh and at Imperial
College School of Medicine at St. Mary's Hospital in London said
BSE and human BSE are caused by the same disease agent, possibly a
novel form of protein called prions. Whether humans were infected
by bovine products, or from an independent source entirely, remains
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   News last year that two of the British victims had been blood
donors has led to the establishment of a $77.5 million program to
strip donated blood of the white blood cells that might carry the
BSE agent. Meanwhile, Britain is importing most of its blood for
plasma, mainly from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists regard the small number of cases among humans as
a reason for optimism. But estimates of how many cases may follow
vary wildly, from tens to hundreds to hundreds of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   More than 173,000 cows from all over Britain have been confirmed
to be infected. Hundreds of thousands more might have entered the
food supply undetected.
</P>
<P>
   Though the inquiry has yet to draw conclusions, its work has
brought some comfort to the families of people affected by the
disease. ``What we want is the truth,'' said Stephen Churchill's
mother, Dot Churchill. ``We believe that's what we'll be told by
the inquiry.''

MARJORY FARQUHAR, A MOUNTAINEER AND PHOTOGRAPHER, DIES AT 95 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Marjory Bridge Farquhar, a mountaineer,
conservationist and photographer, died at her San Francisco home
Friday after a short illness. She was 95.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1934s, when rope climbing techniques were still new,
Farquhar made a name for herself as a skilled climber, becoming the
first woman to ascend the Higher Cathedral Spire in the Yosemite
National Park. Two years later, she became the first woman to climb
the difficult east face of Mount Whitney, in the Sequoia National
Park, the highest peak in the continental United States.
</P>
<P>
   Born Nov. 7, 1903, she grew up in San Francisco. Farquhar
attended the University of California at Berkeley, graduating in
1925, after which she launched her career as a photographer. In
1930 she established the firm Bridge &AMP; Gunn. It became Bridge &AMP;
Leonard in the 1940s. Farquhar specialized in weddings and
children's portraits and shared photography experiences with
friends including Ansel Adams and Cedric Wright.
</P>
<P>
   She married Francis P. Farquhar, an accountant, in 1934. Both
were active members of the Sierra Club. Francis Farquhar, the
author of ``History of the Sierra Nevada,'' served as president of
the Sierra Club for two terms, and as editor of the organization's
newsletter for 27 years. He died in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   From 1929 through the 1960s, Marjory Farquhar led Sierra Club
``High Trips,'' introducing people to the beauty of the Sierra
Nevada. She served on the boards of the Sierra Club and the
Save-the-Redwoods League. For almost four decades, the Farquhars
opened their Berkeley home to members of the Sierra Club, the
American Alpine Club, and mountaineers from around the world,
including Sir Edmund Hillary, Maurice Herzog and Heinrich Harrer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their living room was the ground zero of the conservation
movement in California,'' wrote climber and historian Nicholas
Clinch in his introduction to Marjory Farquhar's oral history.
</P>
<P>
   She was well traveled. At 18, she made her first trip abroad,
touring China, the Philippines, Japan and Vietnam. She took part in
the YWCA International Conference in Yugoslavia in 1925 and made an
expedition around the world in 1951. She traveled to Europe,
Africa, Australia and Antarctica to take part in photography
projects, and filmed a documentary on her white-water rafting trip
through the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   She contributed to the Regional Oral History Office of the
Bancroft Library at the University of California at Berkeley,
documenting the history of her life and narrating a project for the
Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   Farquhar moved back to San Francisco in 1992. She is survived by
three children, Peter and Roger P. Farquhar of San Francisco, and
Suzanne Farquhar Ellmore of Santa Cruz; five grandchildren; one
great-granddaughter; two foster grandchildren; and many nieces and
nephews.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When they are asked to identify the greatest threat to their
health, most American women name breast cancer. Most of them are
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Women overestimate their risk of getting breast cancer,
researchers say, and they also overestimate the odds that the
disease will be fatal. Few feel anywhere near the same dread of
heart disease, even though it kills far more women, and few realize
that lung cancer surpassed breast cancer 10 years ago as the
leading cause of death from cancer in women.
</P>
<P>
   Though some women have genes that greatly increase their risk of
contracting the disease, the majority do not, and doctors worry
that, over all, excessive fear of breast cancer may lead women to
neglect the other conditions that are much more likely to kill
them: to be cavalier about smoking or lack of exercise, for
instance, or to refuse estrogen replacement therapy after
menopause.
</P>
<P>
   Even though estrogen is strongly recommended for women at risk
for cardiovascular disease, some who would probably benefit from it
turn it down, preferring to take their chances with a heart attack
or stroke rather than accept what so far appears to be a small
increased risk of breast cancer linked to the hormone.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced heart failure ``sounds like something you can live
with, even though it's a fatal disease,'' said Dr. Barbara Weber,
director of the Breast Cancer Program at the University of
Pennsylvania Cancer Center in Philadelphia. ``It sounds less
painful than breast cancer. And taking blood pressure medicine and
nitroglycerin doesn't sound so bad. But chemotherapy is
frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   A study published this month reflected the lengths to which
women would go in hope of avoiding the disease: The study included
639 women at high risk who chose to have both breasts removed while
they were still healthy. The surgery, not commonly performed, did
yield an 80 percent to 90 percent reduction in cases and deaths
from breast cancer _ but only 18 lives were saved, meaning that
many of the women who had their breasts removed may have survived
without the drastic procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some fear of breast cancer is still not unreasonable.
The numbers are daunting: 178,700 new cases in 1998, 43,500 deaths.
Nearly every woman knows someone, or knows of someone, who died of
breast cancer. In women's minds, the disease and the treatments for
it are inextricably tied to disfigurement, suffering and death.
</P>
<P>
   Women also associate breast cancer with dying young. Although
more women die of heart disease every year _ it accounts for 30
percent of all deaths among women, as opposed to 3 percent from
breast cancer _ it is also true that in some of their most vibrant
years, their mid-30s to mid-50s, more women die of breast cancer
than heart disease. Early deaths among family or friends loom large
in many women's memories.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the women who die young, particularly in families with
many cases of breast cancer, may have carried a gene that
predisposed them to the disease. Studies during the past decade
have identified mutations in two genes, known as BRCA1 and BRCA2,
that greatly increase a woman's risk of breast cancer, but
inherited breast cancer is still thought to account for only 10
percent to 15 percent of cases.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, well-meaning public health campaigns may have made
some of the fears even worse than they should be. The prediction
that one in eight women in the United States will develop breast
cancer is one of the most quoted and, to many women, most alarming
statistics ever promoted by the National Cancer Institute and the
American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   The number is technically correct. But it is also confusing and
misleading, and it may serve to make a disease that is already bad
enough sound even worse. When cancer specialists sit down with a
woman to estimate her personal risk, one in eight is not the
statistic they use.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a double-edged sword,'' said Dr. Weber. ``It has
heightened women's awareness, and it's probably responsible for
getting them to have mammograms and breast examinations. It may
have helped get money for research. But the downside is that many
people are overly frightened, and overestimate their risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every healthy woman she counsels about risk, Dr. Weber
said, has an exaggerated notion, sometimes wildly so, of her own
peril from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The one-in-eight statistic derives from research on large
populations of women, studied from birth to death. When all the
cases of breast cancer, including those in women who live past 85,
are added up over the years, one in eight women, or 12.5 percent,
get the disease.
</P>
<P>
   But the one-in-eight figure does not mean that any individual
woman, at any given time, has a one-in-eight risk of getting cancer
that year _ or even in the next 10 years. Rather, the figures apply
to the population as a whole, and cannot predict individual
variation in risk from one woman to another due to genetic and
environmental differences, like obesity and alcohol intake.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the single lifetime statistic does not reflect the
fact that a woman's risk actually changes with time.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, doctors emphasize, is that the statistic does
not mean that women have a one in eight chance of dying from breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting breast cancer is not the same as dying of breast
cancer,'' said Dr. Kathy Helzlsouer, director of the Breast and
Ovarian Surveillance Service at the Oncology Center at Johns
Hopkins University. ``We lose sight of that sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   When the disease is treated early, before it can spread, 97
percent of patients are still alive five years later, according to
the American Cancer Society. But if the cancer reaches lymph nodes,
the five-year rate is 76 percent, and if it invades bones or other
organs, the rate is only 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among all women with the disease, at all stages, 50 percent to
60 percent survive 15 years. But in women who are treated early,
survival is higher.
</P>
<P>
   The death rate actually declined 5.6 percent from 1990 to 1994,
a drop that researchers attributed to better detection and
treatment, and that some thought would turn out to be just the
beginning of a major decrease in deaths.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to estimating individual risk, even some doctors
have trouble understanding statistics and explaining them to
patients. In a recent issue of The New England Journal of Medicine,
researchers from Toronto recommended that doctors move beyond the
one-in-eight lifetime statistic to a set of numbers that would make
more sense to most women and that would be closer to the figures
that cancer experts cite when they advise women about risk.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of calculating lifetime risk, this approach figures the
odds that a woman will develop cancer during the next five years,
or the next decade. It does that by comparing her to a large group
of women her age whose breast cancer rate during the time interval
in question is known.
</P>
<P>
   The method is based on actual rates of breast cancer in women of
various ages in Ontario in 1995, which are comparable to those in
the United States. The researchers used those rates to create a
table showing how many new cases would be expected in 1,000 women
at five-year intervals from birth through the age of 85 and beyond.
The figures show that risk increases with age: It is very low in
women in their 20s and 30s, and then begins rising.
</P>
<P>
   The table can be used to calculate a woman's odds of developing
breast cancer in a particular decade: That is done by dividing
1,000 by the number of cases of cancer during that decade.
</P>
<P>
   The technique shows that, contrary to what many women have been
led to believe, there is no decade in which a woman's risk is one
in eight. For women entering their 30s, it is 1 in 250, and for
those in their 40s it is 1 in 77. It never exceeds 1 in 34, which
occurs during a woman's 60s and 70s.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Julia Knight, an author of the journal article and an
epidemiologist at Cancer Care Ontario, a government agency, said
many people were overwhelmed by the one-in-eight lifetime
statistic. ``Most people aren't used to dealing with numbers like
that,'' she said. ``I worry about the fear factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Knight said public health campaigns based on the
one-in-eight statistic could have the unintended effect of making
some women so frightened of breast cancer that they would go into
denial about the disease and give up on tests aimed to detect it
early. She said she and her colleagues had tried to develop a means
of communicating risk that would be more realistic and also less
threatening.
</P>
<P>
   The table, she said, ''is reasonable for a ball-park number.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the table reflects increased risk with age, Dr. Knight
and her colleagues acknowledge that it represents the average woman
and does not take into account individual differences, especially
in women who have a higher than average chance of developing breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers also agree that it makes more sense for women
to look at their risk in 10-year intervals, rather than trying to
make sense of their lifetime odds. For women with family histories
or personal histories of breast problems that suggest a higher than
average risk of the disease, some medical centers have created
special clinics to provide risk assessment, counseling and extra
examinations and mammograms when they are needed.
</P>
<P>
   In one such program, at the University of Pennsylvania, Dr.
Weber said she and her colleagues started with population figures
like those in the table created by Dr. Knight, and adjusted them
for individual histories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our approach to a patient at 35 will be different than at 85,
and we hope that what we know will be different by then, too,'' she
said. ``So, we take everything a step at a time.''

THE HOME, SWEET HOME OF THE FUTURE WILL SELFISHLY BARRICADE US FROM
WORLD
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Big whiny babies. We want to be fed, we want to be clean and we
want to feel secure. Oh, and we don't want to share with the
neighbors. When you get right down to our very basic desires, we're
nothing but a bunch of babies.
</P>
<P>
   This was one of the forecasts at last week's International Home
Builders' Show at Dallas' Convention Center where new products in
more than 1,000 exhibits were often geared toward lovely, expansive
places to prepare meals, spalike bathrooms and as much separation
from the neighbors as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The home building industries are trying to accommodate the
pampered, self-centered, lazy, reclusive consumer who it seems
would really rather be living in the south of France.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, this embarrassing trend toward infantile behavior
was not visible to the public. The Builders' Show is a closed
event. Still, more than 70,000 attendees, from 90 nations, got a
glimmer of the future.
</P>
<P>
   It was midday Friday, just an hour after the opening bell when
our transparent desires were enumerated at the seminar introducing
1998's Best of American Living Awards. These are homes, chosen by
the National Association of Home Builders and Professional Builder
magazine, that represent design quality and sales potential. There
are scads of categories, separated by square-footage amounts. The
winners illustrate our indulgent proclivities and point to the
homes of the future.
</P>
<P>
   We want a fortress, so we'll abandon the front yards. No more
mowing, weeding and fertilizing to maintain a pretty view for the
neighbors. We're not that nice anymore. We're putting up fences.
We'll have a paved motor court, surrounded with walls and
decorative gates. We'll use fountains, benches and a few scattered
urns with foliage to soften the look. Architectural sleights of
hand will create the illusion of inner walls and multiple barriers
before passage to the front door is achieved. It's not friendly,
but we'll like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The house will start at the curb. The longer the transition to
the front door, the more secure people feel,'' says Jeb Breithaupt,
a Louisiana-based architect and one of the contest's judges.
</P>
<P>
   From the street, our walled neighborhoods will resemble feudal
duchies. Which will seem completely appropriate with the prevailing
architectural style of 17th and 18th century rural dwellings of
Italy and France. American traditionalism is now crossing the
water, back to the old country, to find old styles that look new.
Euro-cottages will replace saltboxes and bungalows. This style does
have a positive note that has been neglected for some time _ the
entire house is designed, not just the front facade. The back of
the house is as interesting and richly appointed as the front, and
the overall scale is more human. One-story front doors will be the
norm.
</P>
<P>
   The back yard (which has a minimum of grass) will be an
extension of the family living space, so it will need to have
character and privacy. Fire pits (often with gas logs), waterfalls
and rock scapes will be used as if they were created by a Disney
theme park designer.
</P>
<P>
   Inside our new homes, we have abandoned the formal living room
and given that space to the family room/kitchen combination, an
area that is now the hub of family life. We will spend lavishly on
this area as if our kitchen churns out four-star food. Beautiful
tile, cabinets of exotic woods, space-saving organizers of every
stripe will surround appliances of a size usually found in
convention hotels. The delectable meals prepared in this
masterfully designed laboratory will be served in the formal dining
room.
</P>
<P>
   We still have some standards. The dining room, with chandelier,
stays.
</P>
<P>
   You'll hardly recognize the bathroom. It's so grand, large and
luscious. Our tubs will be the size of small swimming pools, and
they'll be able to create a vacations-worth of effects from Niagara
Falls to class II rapids. We'll have Baccarat crystal faucets on
our sinks and saunas next to the showers.
</P>
<P>
   We'll use our home spas every morning before we stroll to our
home office. Unless we choose to have a home theater.
</P>
<P>
   These two money-suckers are vying for the remainder of our
indulgent real estate dollars. Although it seems unhealthy to have
both _ giving us no reason to ever leave the house _ this is
exactly the way we want it.
</P>
<P>
   No place is as comfortable as our home of the future. If we have
to leave, we're likely to have a tantrum.

KIDMAN GETTING ALL THE BUZZ, BUT THERE'S BETTER THEATER TO BE HAD
</HEADLINE>
 (Accompanied by BC-BROADWAY-HOTTICKETS) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARK LOWRY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Natasha Richardson, Kevin Spacey, Laurence Fishburne,
Glenn Close, Liam Neeson: all established Hollywood stars who have
recently starred or will soon star on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   So why haven't any of them incited the frenzy that Nicole Kidman
has with her current role in David Hare's ``The Blue Room?''
</P>
<P>
   That answer can be boiled down to one word: skin.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the mega-celebrity, and you've got ticket sales
through the roof _ the show's three-month run sold out way before
its opening _ plus the sort of pre-show hype that Broadway dreams
of. Seems like everyone wants a glimpse of the naked bod of one of
Hollywood's best-known actresses. (And, dare we mention, wife of
another sex symbol, Tom Cruise.)
</P>
<P>
   Too bad it was the kind of hype that would inevitably cause
overwhelming disappointment; for the show is, sadly, only mediocre.
Not only is the nudity aspect oversold _ she bares her backside for
about 10 seconds in a dimly lit scene _ but Kidman offers a
performance that is merely adequate. There's nothing bad about it,
but it's not much to holler about either.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this Broadway season, both on- and off-, does offer
several things to get excited about, none of which is sold as
celebrity skin. A few blocks downtown, you'll find far better
performances from Zoe Wanamaker in Sophocles' ``Electra.'' Venture
farther away from Times Square and be blown away by Uta Hagen and
Fort Worth's Lorca Simons in ``Collected Stories,'' or the
extraordinary theater experience that is ``Hedwig and the Angry
Inch.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet Kidman's play has overshadowed the others, so much so that
some theatergoers are rumored to have selected seats based on
getting the best peek at her bod. ``Pure theatrical Viagra'' was
one British critic's now-famous rave about ``The Blue Room'' when
he saw it in London before its Broadway debut. That comment has
received as much criticism as has the production. A New York Times
columnist even suggested that maybe the aforementioned critic had
been temporarily deprived of human contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blue Room'' is based on Austrian playwright Arthur
Schnitzler's 1900 work ``La Ronde.'' Directed by Sam Mendes (who
most recently directed the acclaimed revival of ``Cabaret''), the
play features Kidman and British actor Iain Glen, each playing five
characters in 10 daisy-chained vignettes dealing with the
relationship between male and female, namely, sex.
</P>
<P>
   Kidman portrays a young prostitute, an au pair, a married woman,
a model and an actress; Glen is a cabdriver, a student, a
politician, a playwright and an aristocrat. Each scenario climaxes
with the lights out and a screen displaying the time it took for
The Act to happen. One interlude lasts a few hours, but more often
it's only a matter of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Glen, who tries his best to assign pathos to his compassionless
characters, gives a more assured performance than Kidman. But the
only resemblance of chemistry between them comes in the
playwright/model scene, in which we not only see Kidman's derriere,
but Glen cartwheeling in his birthday suit.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping in mind that the dynamics of stage and screen acting are
different, don't see ``The Blue Room'' expecting Kidman to give the
same caliber performance she did in ``To Die For,'' her finest turn
thus far.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blue Room'' is not bad. It's at least worth the price of
balcony seats. But please, don't buy into the hype that Kidman can
be seen in all her glory for extended periods of time, because
you'll only walk away saying, ``Oh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blue Room'' plays through March 7 at the Cort Theatre, 138
W. 48th St. $35-$60. Telecharge.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Hot prospects &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Kidman is not the only hot thing going in the New York
theater scene right now. And no, we're not talking about all that
Lloyd Webber and other schlock that ``tourists'' flock to. Other
shows worth checking out include:
</P>
<P>
   ``ELECTRA''
</P>
<P>
   If, as some have suggested, New York theatergoers showed a
temporary lapse in sophistication by going gaga over Nicole Kidman
threadbare, they made up for it in their support for Frank
McGuinness' adaptation of Sophocles' pithy ``Electra.'' Thanks to
accomplished direction by David Leveaux and the slick apocalyptic
art direction, the show emerges a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrated British stage veteran Zoe Wanamaker brings authority
to the title role, but, as is easy for any actress playing one of
the great tragic female leads of Greek drama to do, overpowers all
in her supporting cast, save for Claire Bloom's Clytemnestra, the
mother whom Electra spends the entire play plotting revenge
against.
</P>
<P>
   One peculiar change is that the chorus of the women of Mycenae
are boiled down to three roles. Only one of them, played by Pat
Carroll, speaks. It almost works, except that the other two are
left to wander around the stage reacting to everything. Of them,
Mirjana Jokovic gets some action, but Myra Lucretia Taylor stands
in the aesthetically pleasing spot of the moment, usually looking
away with grievous concern.
</P>
<P>
   The pluses far outweigh the minuses, though. ``Electra'' is well
worth seeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Electra'' has been extended through March 28 at the Ethel
Barrymore Theatre, 243 W. 47th St. $35-$60. Telecharge.

BEHAVIOR: TERRIFIED, BUT FEELING GOOD ABOUT IT

<P>
   Today's amusement park rides are faster, scarier and more
elaborate than ever, and some theme park visitors are clutching
their stomachs and opting for the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to help patrons who want to board roller coasters
in spite of their fears, Universal Studios Islands of Adventure in
Orlando, Fla., is offering the first stress-management program for
apprehensive riders, led by two psychologists.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Otto, director of the Cognitive-Behavior Therapy
program at Massachusetts General Hospital and assistant professor
of psychology at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Brian Newmark, a
clinical psychologist in private practice outside of Boston, will
use anxiety-management techniques to help ease the fears of
``coasterphobics'' and also to train Islands of Adventure employees
to identify and comfort anxious visitors. A two-day seminar for the
staff runs Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A roller coaster takes control of emotion,'' Otto said. ``It's
a machine designed to give you the feeling of a thrill.'' The
difference between an enthusiast and a phobic, he added, is how
each handles the fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``While one group is saying `wow,''' Otto added, ``the other
group is saying `uh-oh, when will this stop?' ''
</P>
<P>
   People who applied for the seminar listed bad childhood
experiences with coasters _ experiences like getting sick, being
coerced into riding and panicking _ as possible sources of their
fears.
</P>
<P>
   They also mentioned heart palpitations, trembling, sweaty palms,
nausea and dizziness as symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   All the participants expressed a determination to confront their
fears _ fear of speed, technology, heights and loss of control.
</P>
<P>
   Otto added: ``Roller coasters are designed to maximize the
illusion of danger. They're really very safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Cliff, a spokesman for the International Association of
Amusement Parks and Attractions, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last 20 years there have been slightly less than two
amusement park or theme park deaths per year in the United
States,'' Cliff said. ``That puts the odds of being in a fatal
accident at 1 in 300 million.''
</P>

<P>
   TRENDS: LURKING PERILS ON THE TIP OF THE TONGUE
</P>
<P>
   A practice that could pass as a Draconian punishment for
perjury, tongue piercing, has pushed its way into youth culture _
and the trend is alarming many dentists.
</P>
<P>
   The American Dental Association passed a resolution at its 139th
Annual Session, held recently in San Francisco, to oppose oral
piercing, which it considers a public health hazard.
</P>
<P>
   Enthusiasts pay piercers, who are unlicensed and are trained by
apprenticing with senior colleagues, $50 or more to punch a hole
through their lips, cheeks, or tongue (the most common site) with
the mouth jewelry of the customer's choice, usually a 12-gauge
needle tipped with two balls like a barbell.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Shelia Price, a professor at the West Virginia University
School of Dentistry, said that people who undergo the procedure
should insist that it be performed under sterile conditions. They
also should be aware of the risks involved, such as the possible
transmission of hepatitis, HIV, and other blood-borne pathogens,
Price added.
</P>
<P>
   And there are other unpleasant side effects of piercing, among
them tongue pain that often lasts a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be nerve damage that affects the way you talk and
swallow,'' said Dr. Timothy Rose, president of the dental
association. ``When you swallow 2,000 times a day on average, this
can be a lifelong problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our chief concern is beyond whether it's crazy or not,'' Rose
continued, trying not to be judgmental.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have someone stick a needle, clean or dirty, through a
vascular part of your body _ the risk of disease has to be
immense,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHILDBIRTH: OF MIND, BODY AND LOW BIRTH WEIGHT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pregnant women have plenty to worry about, including not
worrying too much. A number of medical studies have found that
there is in fact a link between anxiety during pregnancy and low
birth weight.
</P>
<P>
   Now a team of researchers from England has uncovered what could
be the mechanism for that mind-body connection. Women who described
themselves as more anxious were more apt to have restrictions in
the blood flow to their fetuses, the researchers reported.
</P>
<P>
   Working in Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital in London, the
researchers gave questionnaires to 100 women in their third
trimester of pregnancy to gauge their ``state anxiety'' or how
worried they were about their current situation and their ``trait
anxiety'' or how worried they were in general.
</P>
<P>
   Next they measured blood flow through the uterine arteries by
ultrasound, looking for irregularities indicating resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-seven percent of women whose answers indicated the
highest levels of either kind of anxiety were found to have high
levels of resistance, compared with 4 percent for less anxious
women. Those with known medical problems were excluded from the
study.
</P>
<P>
   The results were published Jan. 15 in The British Medical
Journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``One doesn't want to overworry women, but it is better to be
relaxed,'' said one of the researchers, Dr. Vivette Glover.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that too much remained unknown to base clinical advice
on the findings. ``We certainly don't want it to be interpreted as
saying that women shouldn't work.''
</P>

   MUSCLE GROUPS: FOR WOMEN, A TOUCHDOWN PASS TO FITNESS  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Sue Spiegel, 33, a television producer, didn't know
a blitz from a blintz and assumed ``first and 10'' was a New York
street address. But on Sunday, after a year of weekly football
workouts, she will be in front of the television, second-guessing
Super Bowl strategy and empathizing with the players.
</P>
<P>
   Spiegel now has a good idea of how hard football players work,
thanks to a football program run by Bob Shaw, a personal trainer
and the owner of Physical Structure, a New York City health club.
Last year, he added 40 minutes of offensive passing drills to his
one-on-one training sessions to coax a dozen of his 90 female
clients into running sprints.
</P>
<P>
   ``My clients have to memorize my playbook, and I require them to
watch at least a quarter of a game a week,'' said Shaw, 32. ``After
having no idea what football is about and not caring about it, they
go to the park and run and throw, and they get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose Fiorilli, an executive at Chanel, said Shaw's football
routine was the only way she could bear running sprints. ``Without
passing drills, I can't imagine running 50-yard sprints,'' said
Fiorilli, 37. ``But doing passing drills, or 40 minutes of going
all out, really gets my cardio up there.'' It also helped Fiorilli
solve another chronic exercise problem: ``I don't get as bored,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said the drills also got his clients to burn calories, to
use muscle groups they normally would not and to maintain
flexibility. They also get very dirty. ``After 20 minutes, they're
sweating to death, they've fallen down a couple of times.''
</P>
<P>
   Spiegel says she enjoys the challenge, which takes her mind off
of the strenuous nature of the exercise. ``The first time I did it,
I was running and diving and sucking wind. My quads were killing
me,'' she said. ``But I felt invincible.''
</P>
<P>
   This fall Shaw plans to expand his program into a touch football
league. Spiegel said she was ready to join. ``After I played, I
could see that it wasn't just a bunch of guys on the field hitting
each other,'' she said. ``And the first time I caught the ball, I
finally understood why those guys do that stupid dance after a
touchdown.''

`THE TRIUMPH OF EVIL': GENOCIDE IN AFRICA, QUIBBLES IN THE WEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
 (fb)  
 By WALTER GOODMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The horror with which Joseph Conrad stamped Africa a century ago
persists in Tuesday night's ``Frontline'' report on the 1994
slaughter in Rwanda. The journalists and former officials who
testify affectingly in ``The Triumph of Evil'' offer evidence that
policy planners in Europe, the United States and the United Nations
knew what was coming but lacked the will to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   The word genocide shadows the hour, emerging from the rivalry
between the minority Tutsi, who had a privileged position under
Belgian colonial rule, and the poorer Hutu, who were held in a kind
of servitude. With independence, suppressed hatreds burst out, and
those described here as Hutu extremists began a campaign of
extermination against the Tutsi.
</P>
<P>
   An official with the small U.N. peacekeeping force tells of
early warnings about the the Hutu militia's plans for a campaign of
killing. But proposals by commanders in the field to resist the
Hutu ran up against fears of higher authorities of being lured into
a Somalia-like debacle, when 18 American Rangers were killed by
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   And so it went, with dire warnings and murderous raids ignored
or played down by the West. The reports of unprotected civilians'
and even U.N. soldiers' being beaten and slashed to death brought
only withdrawal by the peacekeepers, leaving thousands of refugees
who had counted on them as a shield against the Hutu. When the
Western troops fled, they escorted their own citizens to safety. A
Belgian reporter says: ``The only mandate was evacuate white
people. It could have been another mandate.''
</P>
<P>
   The witnesses' descriptions are ghastly. A Tutsi woman says:
``We were pretending to be dead. They took stones and smashed the
heads of the bodies, they took little children and smashed their
heads together. When they found someone breathing, they pulled them
out and finished them off. They killed my family. I saw them kill
my papa and my brother, but I didn't see what happened to my
mother.''
</P>
<P>
   In a hundred days, 800,000 people were killed. ``The Triumph of
Evil'' makes little attempt to give the official arguments for
inaction. Instead, a State Department spokeswoman is heard making
legalistic distinctions between ``genocide'' and ``acts of
genocide,'' while the Hutu radio fueled passions: ``All Tutsis will
perish. They will disappear from the earth. We strike them down
with arms. Slowly, slowly, slowly, we kill them like rats.''
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to policy makers, every proposed action carried a
risk, and the continuing turmoil in the area, even after Tutsi
guerrillas won their war, gave little hope for a quick _ much less
tranquil _ ending to a chronicle of horror. But the killings remain
with us.
</P>
<P>
   This strong indictment, the latest of ``Frontline's''
examinations of American policy in Africa, ends with a devastating
summation of Clinton administration policy by Phillip Gourevitch,
one of the correspondents relied on Tuesday night: ``It wasn't a
failure to act. The decision was not to act. And at that, we
succeeded greatly.''

`MARA AND DAN': FLAT-FOOTED LESSING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With ``Mara and Dann,'' Doris Lessing returns to Africa, the
continent that so richly inspired her earliest fiction. The place
is now called Ifrik, however, and it's light years removed from the
Africa described with such realism and ardor in her early Martha
Quest novels. Though closer, in many respects, to the remote,
mythic realms conjured up in her ``Canopus in Argos'' series, it's
even less imaginatively rendered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mara and Dann'' takes place in the distant future, thousands
and thousands of years after a great ice age has destroyed
civilization. Most of the world is still uninhabitable, and a
killing drought has turned most of southern Ifrik into a desert.
Among the refugees making their way north are Mara and Dann, the
heroes of this rambling, picaresque novel. Their tiresome
adventures not only recapitulate assorted myths and fables but also
embody several of Ms. Lessing's favorite themes: namely, the ever
shifting relationship between individuals and society, and the
eternal tension between domesticity and freedom, responsibility and
independence.
</P>
<P>
   As the novel opens, another of Ms. Lessing's coolly omniscient
narrators informs us that 7-year-old Mara and her 4-year-old
brother, Dann, have been abducted and taken for their safekeeping
to a remote Rock People's village. Their murdered parents were
members of the Mahondi royal court, it seems, and the two children
_ much like Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia in ``Star Wars'' _have
been given new identities for their own protection.
</P>
<P>
   In the Rock People's village, a kindly old woman named Daima
looks after Mara and Dann. Water and food are painfully scarce
here, and the few people in the village who have not left in search
of a better life are close to dying of starvation. Life, in fact,
is conducted on a sort of Stone Age subsistence level: Virtually
all knowledge of technology and science has been lost, and even
basic facts of history have slipped into the misty realm of rumor
and legend.
</P>
<P>
   Years pass, and Dann leaves the village with two strangers,
while Mara stays on to care for the ailing Daima. The drought has
worsened, and the two women are now the village's only residents.
More years pass, Daima dies and Dann returns to rescue his sister.
The two then set off, with their family legacy of 50 gold pieces,
and head north, like so many refugees before them. Mara is driven
by her craving for knowledge _ her hunger to learn who she is and
what the history of her family and her country has been _ while
Dann seems to be driven by internal demons, by his fear of seen and
unseen enemies.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of Ms. Lessing's novel quickly devolves into a
series of repetitious and annoyingly predictable encounters with
evil villains, kindly benefactors and unforgiving weather. Mara and
Dann doggedly make their way through hot, dusty deserts and
menacing little towns filled with spies and informers. One or the
other of them is constantly being kidnapped, enslaved or drafted
into an army. And the other one is constantly rescuing his or her
sibling, often with the help of benevolent strangers who want to
take the young Mahondis under their wing.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all the bad people Mara and Dann meet are short, thick
and ugly; virtually all the good people they meet are tall, thin
and gracious. These Manichaean dichotomies are not the only thing
that this novel has in common with Ms. Lessing's ``Canopus in
Argos'' series; the books also share a fairy tale flatness, an
overfondness for easy symbolism and a tendency to look at human
affairs from a telescopic distance that reduces all governments,
all peoples to pawns in a cosmic cycle of ``rise and fall, fall and
rise.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that ``Mara and Dann'' lacks the operatic
grandeur of the ``Canopus'' novels, and it also feels perfunctory
in the extreme, as if the author were randomly stringing one
incident upon the last, one crisis upon another. Although the
kindhearted Mara is a sympathetic heroine _ a survivor, like so
many of Ms. Lessing's women, who is defined largely by her travails
_ she is a pallid, two-dimensional version of the characters who
were delineated with such psychological and social detail in the
author's early, more realistic work.
</P>
<P>
   As for Dann, he is a hodgepodge of male attitudes and postures,
alternately childish and commanding, mercenary and protective. The
minor characters in the novel are crude types, not individuals,
people defined solely by their role in helping or hindering Mara
and Dann in their quest to move north.
</P>
<P>
   In the end the moral of this cautionary tale is equally
simplistic. It's a moral about the catastrophic destruction of
civilization, a moral that has surfaced many times before in Ms.
Lessing's work (in as early a novel as ``The Four-Gated City'' and
again and again throughout the ``Canopus'' series) but never quite
as simplistically as in this dreary novel.
</P>
<P>
   Of the so-called ancients _ that is, modern human beings who
were supposedly killed off by the ice age _ Ms. Lessing writes in
her flat-footed way: ``These were peoples who had no interest in
the results of their actions. They killed out the animals. They
poisoned the fish in the sea. They cut down forests, so that
country after country, once forested, became desert or arid. They
spoiled everything they touched. There was probably something wrong
with their brains. There are many historians who believe that these
ancients richly deserved the punishment of the Ice.''

NEW CENTER PARTY TO BATTLE NETANYAHU  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The last national election here turned into a
referendum on the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord. The one set for
this spring, however, is less ideological. It is a referendum on
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu appeared certain to emerge as the Likud Party
candidate for prime minister after votes from Monday's internal
party primaries are tallied. And as an incumbent whose strong
character has served as a lightning rod for the fierce emotions
that rule this society, he will be the issue that dominates this
campaign season until the May 17 election day.
</P>
<P>
   That was clear when the four leaders of the new center party
officially announced on Monday what had already leaked out: Yitzhak
Mordechai, the popular defense minister whom Netanyahu dismissed on
live television on Saturday night, will lead a new centrist party
as its candidate for prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, the former army chief-of-staff whose star
has dimmed in the weeks since he became a center candidate, stepped
aside and accepted the second place on the party ticket. This
proved, he said, that, contrary to Netanyahu's charges, ``we are
not an entourage of egos.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Meridor, the former finance minister, and Roni Milo, the
former mayor of Tel Aviv, who gave birth to the idea of a center
party seven months ago, completed the center ``team'' _ all but
Shahak defectors from the Likud. All four men lined up before
television cameras Monday night, wearing nearly identical blue
shirts and exuding a common goal more important than their
as-yet-unnamed party's platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say this as clearly as possible,'' Milo said. ``Our
purpose is to overthrow the government of Benjamin Netanyahu.''
</P>
<P>
   From right, left and particularly from the center, what every
candidate seems to want is Netanyahu's ``head on a platter,'' as
Hemi Shalev, a political analyst for the Maariv newspaper, put it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a campaign of revenge, no less than an election
campaign,'' Shalev said.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's Likud primaries, turn-out was low, around 30 percent
of the 160,000 eligible voters.
</P>
<P>
   Monday-night exit polls predicted that Netanyahu would be the
sure winner over Moshe Arens, his one-time political mentor and
former defense minister, who came out of retirement to challenge
the prime minister. Results were to be announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Following his likely defeat, Arens is expected to take over as
defense minister on Tuesday, succeeding Mordechai, who held his
farewell ceremonies on Monday before leaving the Cabinet to
announce his candidacy to replace his former boss.
</P>
<P>
   In the centrists' television appearance on Monday night, Milo
strongly denounced the prime minister for his public dismissal of
Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you, Bibi Netanyahu,'' he said, ``Menachem Begin is
turning over in his grave.'' He was referring to the former
right-wing prime minister, whom Netanyahu often cites as his model.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking forcefully, smiling frequently and even chuckling,
Mordechai appeared to be reveling in his moment. He preached unity
for a badly fragmented Israeli society, which was Shahak's central
theme. He concentrated on social issues _ investment in education,
freedom from discrimination for immigrants, equal rights for women,
a war on unemployment. He advocated the creation of a constitution
for Israel _ something many religious Israelis oppose because they
fear it would place secular society first and erode the rule of
religious law.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that negotiations with the Palestinians had ground to a
halt, Mordechai said he would kickstart them and push forward to
the final-status negotiations, which include such touchy issues as
borders and the future of Israel. He also said he would reopen
negotiations with Syria to discuss the Golan Heights, and that he
would favor returning some land in the context of a security
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu dismissed the entire center line-up with a wave,
declaring that this race will be no different than those in
elections past: a contest between Likud and Labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that what we see here is a passing phenomenon,'' he
said, ``a party of polls that has no path.''
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister was referring to the polls used by the
centrists to determine who among them would lead their party
ticket. He also predicted that the party would end up dissolving
into the Labor Party ticket before the elections.
</P>
<P>
   This prediction is not necessarily off base. Channel One
reported that Mordechai told associates he would ``overturn every
stone in Israel'' in order to defeat Netanyahu, even if that meant
joining the Labor campaign of Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Shahak is heading to the United States to raise money for the
party. Just 19 days ago, newly resigned from the army, he announced
his candidacy to great excitement. But after he made several
blunders that seemed a result of inexperience, the cameras turned
away from him quickly.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, he spoke fluidly, forcefully and a bit
ruefully.

ATHEIST'S BIBLE FETCHES $2,000 AT AUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MacCORMACK  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PFLUGERVILLE, Texas _ The crystal stemware and Lenox china met
lukewarm interest, the Paul Harvey commemorative platter did
somewhat better, and the Madalyn Murray O'Hair coffee cup went for
$47.50.
</P>
<P>
   But when a signed, illustrated children's Bible belonging to
America's most famous atheist hit the auction block, things got
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   In less than a minute of furious one-on-one bidding, the price
for the slim white volume roared past $1,000 and kept climbing.
</P>
<P>
   The book, given to O'Hair three decades ago by 12-year-old
Baptist girls from Winnetka Heights, Okla., went to Austin lawyer
Jimmy Nassour, who offered $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came for this specifically. I was willing to go to $500, and
then I went to $2,000,'' Nassour, 42, said. ``I think it's a museum
piece.''
</P>
<P>
   The man who finished second bought the next item on the list, a
plain Bible, but found small consolation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably would have gone higher, but he would have gone
higher too,'' said Mark Stevens of Paige, Texas, who quit at
$1,900.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted it real bad. But I did get the unsigned one real
cheap. For $25,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The auction was held Saturday in Pflugerville, about 20 miles
north of Austin, in a large metal building also housing goods
seized by the U.S. Marshals Service and the Austin police.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 people registered to bid on the O'Hair inventory,
which included boxes of books, plastic bags of clothing and
furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Madalyn shows up today, I'll expect Elvis to be driving,''
joked Bob Sheehan of Sheehan &AMP; Gaston Auctioneers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funny thing about this stuff ... there are as many people
who are fascinated with it as there are people who say they
wouldn't have anything she owned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair, her son Jon Garth Murray and adopted daughter Robin
O'Hair disappeared in late September 1995 from San Antonio and are
presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   They left behind not only an enduring mystery but a houseful of
personal belongings and unresolved claims by the Internal Revenue
Service.
</P>
<P>
   The auction was conducted two years after the IRS seized the
contents of their house in northwestern Austin to satisfy tax
liens. The house has been sold.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS said Madalyn Murray O'Hair owes more than $250,000, Jon
Murray about $12,000 and Robin less than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The auction, originally set for 1997, was held Saturday after an
agreement was reached among officials involved in bankruptcy cases
involving the estates of the three Murray O'Hairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sale is occurring because the various court-appointed
representatives of the three O'Hairs have agreed to it in order to
use the proceeds to reduce any IRS claims,'' said Gordon McNutt,
who represents Jon Murray's interests.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who turned out Saturday attended because of the
O'Hair name. Others went for bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Auction officials said the prices paid weren't remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to have a souvenir of her estate that I could always
talk about,'' said Tish Paniagua, 56, of San Antonio, who had
claimed a front-row seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a very peculiar person. If I could just have a little
piece of her memory,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Paniagua's husband, Joseph, was high bidder at $10 for a 1969
penny with ``In God We Trust'' rubbed out.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Tempestuous weather will continue in sections of southern
California and the Rockies. Heavy wet snow will intermittently fall
in the southern Sierra, Tehachapi and the San Bernardino Mountains.
Showers and a few thunderstorms with small hail will be scattered
along the coastal Southwest. A disturbance pushing toward Arizona
will promote valley showers and mountain snows in the southern and
central Rockies with heavy accumulation possible on west-facing
slopes in Colorado and eastern Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Low pressure will organize over eastern Colorado and its
circulation will summon very mild and increasingly moist air
northward from the Gulf of Mexico. Fog will obscure sections of the
western Gulf Coast with broken clouds covering most of the southern
Plains and lower Mississippi Valley. As the mild air encounters
chilly air over the snow-covered Middle West and upper Plains, a
thicker overcast will develop with patches of light snow commencing
in the Dakotas and Minnesota. Some freezing rain may glaze surfaces
across northern Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds will streak across the Great Lakes ahead of a warm front.
A mixture of light snow, ice and rain are expected in northern
sections Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure over the Middle Atlantic region will promote dry
and seasonable weather in much of the East. Some clouds and a few
flurries will be noted in the northern Appalachians, but the sky
will be clear along the coast. Warmer air will move into the South
with onshore winds at the coast.
</P>
<P>
   The Northwest will be dull along the coast, but bright and
rather cool inland. Snow showers will linger in the southern
Cascades.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: California Snow
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in 25 years, snow accumulated in Bakersfield,
Calif., in the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley. In the early
morning hours of Monday, a chill rain turned to wet snow which came
down hard for several hours before daybreak. The snow accumulated
several inches around the city, marking the first measurable
snowfall since March 8, 1974. In fact, it had been nine years since
the last snowflakes were noted at Meadows Field. The cold core of a
disturbance from the North Pacific settled over southern
California, leading to the unusual low-elevation snows.

`DILBERT' JUST LIES THERE ONSCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Dilbert'' brings a solid brand name to UPN and to TV
animation. If only it brought the laughs along, too.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Scott Adams' wildly popular comic strip about wage
slaves in corporate hell, ``Dilbert'' was supposed to be something
like the Seventh Cavalry for the beleaguered UPN.
</P>
<P>
   UPN badly needs the bugle call and cavalry charge. But this
blandly written and visually uninteresting ``Dilbert,'' which
premieres Monday, seems more like the Four Horsemen of the
Apocalypse than blue-shirted troopers to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dilbert'' turns out to be an awkward transfer from a
three-panel comic strip to the lunatic ``toon'' world of animated
comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Adams' comic-strip wit is on the dry side as he pokes fun at the
downsizing, inputting and upgrading of modern corporate life. But
animation lends itself best to wet, oversized humor.
</P>
<P>
   The TV show, for which Adams was co-executive producer, tries to
have it both ways. Some nettlesome absurdities of Adams' cubicle
world are preserved, but ``Dilbert'' also strains, without results,
for bigger laughs.
</P>
<P>
   In the pilot, Dilbert (Daniel Stern provides the voice and, yes,
this Dilbert has a mouth) is called upon to save the company when
its flagship product line, throat lozenges, proves to be lethally
defective. Anthrax, it seems, isn't a therapeutic herb.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to the corpse-littered streets of a town wiped out by throat
lozenges. It'd work for ``The Simpsons''; it doesn't for
``Dilbert.''
</P>
<P>
   Same with the looting and burning in the office corridors, after
a downsizing edict. It's exaggerated. It's out of character. It's
``Dilbert'' dialed up too far.
</P>
<P>
   The show's voice cast is first rate. Besides Stern, Chris
Elliott is the voice of Dogbert, Dilbert's bullet-shaped,
bespectacled dog; Larry Miller is the boss with the pointy hair;
Gordon Hunt is Dilbert's office friend Wally; Kathy Griffin is
Alice; and Jackie Hoffman voices Dilbert's mother, Dilmom.
</P>
<P>
   But the animation seems flat and uninspired. Actually, it looks
just like the comic strip, which never relied much on artistic
flourish.
</P>
<P>
   Hence another problem with the transfer. Adams' simple visual
style fits a newspaper page more naturally than a TV screen. The
page is what it is. The screen begs for manic energy from the
animated format.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely enough, ``Dilbert'' might work as a live-action TV
series, where it could be modulated to suit Adams' sensibilities
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dilbert'' was, in fact, clogging the Fox pipeline as a
live-action project before it changed format and network.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously the decision then was that ``Dilbert'' couldn't
succeed with real actors onscreen.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it was that Drew Carey, the one and true live-action
Dilbert, already had his own series.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
--- &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Also contrived to keep you tube-tied Monday night is ``The Tom
Green Show,'' making its premiere on MTV. Green, a Canadian comic,
blends ``Candid Camera'' with the Marquis de Sade. I don't know
exactly what will be in Monday night's show _ there was no
screening tape _ but one Green ploy is to carry a bullhorn and
scream commentary at passers-by on the street.
</P>
<P>
   He's also ridiculed an English-impaired sailor on a Chilean
naval ship and put on a head bandage and crutches to tape the
reactions of strangers as Green kept taking tumbles on a sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this is convulsively funny. None of it is endearing.

COURT REJECTS CLINTON PLAN TO USE SAMPLING FOR 2000 CENSUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Adds White House reaction in 8th graf. Edits throughout.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday rejected President
Clinton's plan to use a new method for the 2000 census that could
have altered America's political landscape and redirected billions
of dollars in federal money in favor of urban and rural minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The method would have employed statistical sampling to help
determine the number of people in the United States rather than
having the government rely completely on the traditional system of
mailing out questionnaires and then dispatching thousands of
enumerators to hunt down those who don't respond.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling 5-4 in favor of a group of citizens who stood to lose
politically and economically because of the administration plan,
the high court said the federal census law bans the use of
statistical methods in conducting the decennial census.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling means that the traditional undercount of urban and
rural minorities during decennial censuses likely will happen again
in 2000. The National Academy of Sciences found that in 1990 the
counting methods employed by the Census Bureau missed some 4
million minorities and double-counted about 4.4 million people,
mostly suburban whites.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans, who had fought the Clinton plan
because it threatened their control of the legislative branch,
hailed the ruling. They also promised that the counting errors made
in 1990 would be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court today reaffirmed a basic constitutional
principle: The census must not be a poll, and everyone must be
counted,'' House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the House subcommittee that
overseas Census Bureau appropriations, said members of his staff
and Census officials have been traveling to traditionally
undercounted areas to meet with local officials to work on ways to
ensure all people are accounted for in the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart called the high court's
ruling a setback for the administration but added that it was a
``limited decision.'' He noted that because the justices did not
rule that sampling was unconstitutional but only that it violated
the census law, Congress could decide to amend the law and support
the method.
</P>
<P>
   However, with Republicans in this Congress strongly opposed to
the method, the sampling debate appeared to be over for the near
term.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists from both political parties said sampling would have
turned up increases in the number of people living in historically
Democratic cities and rural areas, giving the party an advantage
when new boundaries for congressional, state and local legislative
districts are drawn after the 2000 census has been completed.
</P>
<P>
   These strategists also said that since sampling would find
increases in the number of poor people counted in urban and rural
areas, cities and agricultural counties would receive extra federal
dollars at the expense of suburban communities. Census figures are
used for allocating about $180 billion in federal funds each year.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution requires an ``actual enumeration'' of the
nation's population every 10 years to help divide the 435 members
of the House of Representatives among the states.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration had argued that amendments to the
1790 census law, passed in 1976, permitted the use of sampling to
aid traditional counting methods.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the court, said,
``At no point during the debates over these amendments did a single
member of Congress suggest that the amendments would so
fundamentally change the manner in which (Census Bureau) could
calculate the population.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that ``it tests the limits of reason'' to suggest that
Congress would have been silent in enacting ``what would arguably
be the single most significant change in the method of conducting
the decennial census since its inception.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan had been challenged by taxpayers in Connecticut,
Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin who
said sampling would cost them federal money and political power.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans also sued, saying the Constitution as well as
the federal census law allows only a person-by-person head count.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the lawsuits, the administration argued that
neither the group of taxpayers nor Congress had a right to sue
because the 2000 census had yet to be conducted, which meant they
could not prove that they would be hurt.
</P>
<P>
   However, two lower courts ruled separately last year that both
the taxpayers and Congress had a right to sue. The two courts also
said the federal census law does not allow the government to adjust
census figures in apportioning the House members among the states,
as the administration sampling plan would have done.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's ruling, the Supreme Court agreed that the taxpayers
had legal standing to sue. But it dismissed the House Republicans'
suit. The high court also ruled that the 1976 amendments, which
permitted sampling to be used in evaluating information gathered
during the census, did not extend its use for apportionment
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said that because the census law barred the use of
statistical sampling, the high court was not deciding whether such
methods would violate the Constitution's ``actual enumeration''
language.
</P>
<P>
   Joining O'Connor's decision were Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and
Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting were Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter,
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer, who said the federal
census law did not bar the government from adjusting the figures.
</P>
<P>
   In his dissent Stevens argued that the Census Act
``unambiguously authorizes'' the government to ``use sampling
procedures when taking the decennial census.''
</P>
<P>
   The high court had aimed for an early decision in the case to
give the government time to plan for the census, scheduled for
April 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (STORY COULD END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the court also:
</P>
<P>
   _ Ruled that the Federal Communications Commission, and not each
of the 50 states, may set the pricing rules and other regulations
for long-distance companies and others to enter the $110 billion
local telephone market.
</P>
<P>
   _ Set the stage for an important states' rights decision next
year by agreeing to decide in two Florida cases whether the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 wiped out the immunity
that states and their agencies enjoy against lawsuits in state
courts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Agreed to use a dispute over Missouri's campaign-finance
restrictions to clarify how far states can go in limiting the size
of individual contributions to political candidates.

NEW QUESTIONS ON SAFETY IN MEXICO ARE RAISED  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 31) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, Wash.)   (af)  
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The torture and murder of a Texas journalist last
month as he hiked alone through a remote mountainous area in
western Mexico has raised new questions about how safe the country
is for foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico City, crime has risen so dramatically that a kind of
consensus has formed that careless tourists face considerable
danger. ``Crime has reached critical levels,'' says a U.S.
Department of State advisory issued April 29, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   That notice, the most recent, is not a warning, the gravest of
the three levels of advisories. And though it concentrates on
Mexico City, the risks of travel to major tourist destinations like
Cancun and Acapulco have been under vigorous international debate
for months, partly because of news coverage of recent fatal
incidents involving tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Many foreign tourists, especially those who have visited Mexico
repeatedly, say that they believe the news media have
sensationalized these incidents, creating an inaccurate image of
marauders lying in wait for foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to hundreds of people this year who have gone to
Mexico, and none of them has been the victim or even a witness to
serious crime,'' said Tom Slemko, 58, a computer programmer in
Vancouver, Canada, who runs a Web site, the Virtual Mexico Crime
News Page.
</P>
<P>
   Slemko's view appears to represent the experiences of thousands
of tourists who have enjoyed travel in Mexico without incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many Mexican cities we walk at night and we see families
out, much more relaxed and comfortable than in many cities in the
U.S.,'' said Carla Felsted, who with her husband publishes the
travel newsletter Mexican Meanderings in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Because there has been no recent authoritative survey about
crime and tourism in Mexico, virtually everybody's opinions are
based on personal experience and anecdotal evidence. Even the
United States Embassy's Consular Information Sheet, which offers
government officials' best judgment about travel risks, is based
not on any investigation but on an array of reports.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the sheet's warnings have to do with risks in Mexico
City, especially those associated with hailing taxis on the street.
But it offers a few specific warnings about travel elsewhere, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Travelers should exercise caution when traveling on all
highways in Mexico,'' it says. Tourists should travel on
first-class buses, and should never hitchhike anywhere in Mexico,
the sheet says. Nor should travelers walk ``on lightly frequented
beaches, off-the-path ruins, or trails.''
</P>
<P>
   The murder of Philip True, 50, the Mexico correspondent for the
San Antonio Express-News whose body was found Dec. 14, will likely
dispel any doubts about the need for that last warning. True was an
experienced hiker in rural Mexico and a fluent Spanish speaker. He
shared the view that travel risks here have been exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Why he was strangled on a backpacking trek through a Huichol
Indian area along the mountainous border between Jalisco and
Nayarit states remains unclear. Among many dramatic
inconsistencies, the two Huichol men whom authorities have charged
with the murder said in a confession that they had killed True
because he had taken unauthorized photographs.
</P>
<P>
   But in published interviews, they have said True shoved his way
into their home, threatening to rape a Huichol woman. Those who
knew True called that claim preposterous, and relatives of the
accused said that the two men were tortured by police.
</P>
<P>
   Motive remains a mystery in the murder of two Nevada men killed
in their sleeping bags as they slept on a Baja California beach
during a fishing trip. Their bodies were found last February.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was it clear what provoked an attack on an American artist
last March. She was raped and murdered on a beach near Puerto
Escondido, Oaxaca, a hangout for surfers.
</P>
<P>
   Two other recent killings appear to have occurred in the course
of armed robberies: an Egyptian diplomat was killed last year in an
ambush along a mountain highway in Guerrero state, and a Swiss
traveler was gunned down in November when a gang of masked bandits
commandeered one of Mexico's most popular sightseeing trains, which
leads through the Copper Canyon in Chihuahua state. Australian,
Italian and German tourists were also wounded by gunfire during the
same train robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Street crime is on the rise in Acapulco, although no American
tourists have been murdered there recently. Cancun has a reputation
as a safer place, but during 1997 an American tourist was killed by
a hit-and-run driver who, it turned out, was a Quintana Roo state
police officer.
</P>
<P>
   When the American consul to Merida, Yucatan, which has
jurisdiction over Cancun, began to investigate that killing
vigorously, he said that Quintana Roo officials threatened his
life. The consul fled Mexico in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   If news accounts of these events have alarmed some potential
travelers, many others say they consider them to be no more than
isolated incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd take everything you hear about Mexican crime with a
healthy grain of salt,'' said Brad Purdy, a Seattle man who drove
for three weeks through northwestern Mexico in December and
expressed his views on a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The Tourism Ministry says government statistics indicate that
few foreigners are being kept away by the reports of rising crime,
because record numbers of tourists visited Mexico in 1998: nearly
20 million foreigners, 87 percent of them from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that the best evidence that Mexico is a safe and
attractive destination is that the numbers of foreign tourists who
visit just keep growing,'' said Francisco Madrid Flores, a policy
director at the ministry.

 &HT;    Spielberg among 5 nominees for Directors Guild's award
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget the puff and glitter of Sunday night's Golden Globe
Awards. The countdown toward Oscar night turned serious Monday when
the Directors Guild of America named its 1998 nominees for
outstanding directorial achievement in feature film.
</P>
<P>
   James Cameron, last year's winner for ``Titanic,'' presented the
list at the guild's Los Angeles headquarters. The nominees are:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Roberto Benigni, for ``Life Is Beautiful,'' the Italian
comedy-drama about a Jewish father shielding his young son from the
harsh realities of a concentration camp.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  John Madden, for ``Shakespeare in Love,'' the Elizabethan romp
that won three Globes on Sunday, including best musical or comedy
feature.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Terrence Malick, for ``The Thin Red Line,'' a World War II
epic from a director (``Days of Heaven'') who hasn't worked in 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Steven Spielberg, for ``Saving Private Ryan,'' the other WWII
epic, winner of the directing and best dramatic picture Golden
Globes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Peter Weir, for ``The Truman Show,'' starring Jim Carrey as a
man slowly realizing his entire life is a TV show; Carrey won the
top acting award at the Globes.
</P>
<P>
   So why should you care about the DGA nominations? Because
they're one of the most reliable ways to predict Oscar's picks (to
be announced Feb. 9). The DGA nominations, like those of the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, are chosen by the same
people _ directors voting for their peers.
</P>
<P>
   The guild's winning director is almost always the same person
who'll walk home with an Oscar in March. Since handing out its
first award in 1949, the guild and the academy have disagreed only
four times. (Most recently, the DGA named Ron Howard best director
for ``Apollo 13,'' while the academy chose Mel Gibson for
``Braveheart.'')
</P>
<P>
   Malick's nomination is something of a surprise. His ``Thin Red
Line'' was hotly anticipated, rumored to be a competitor for
``Private Ryan.'' But the film opened to very mixed reviews,
reacting to the film's rapturous beauty, but also its inordinate
length and an elliptical structure verging on self-indulgence.
</P>
<P>
   Among those missing from the DGA list were Shekhar Kapur, who
breathed passionate life into ``Elizabeth,'' and Bill Condon, whose
``Gods and Monsters'' drew from Ian McKellen one of the year's best
performances.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the biggest disappointment is the oversight of Steven
Soderbergh, whose savvy work on ``Out of Sight'' turned a basic
heist thriller into a work of art. Soderbergh was also ignored in
most of the other year-end awards, though the movie was named the
best of the year by the National Society of Film Critics, beating
``Private Ryan'' and ``Affliction.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the DGA nominees' five films, only one is not a period piece
(though you could argue that ``The Truman Show'' is one as well,
since it seems to take place in the near-future, not the present).
``Red Line,'' ``Ryan'' and ``Life Is Beautiful'' are all set in
World War II, while ``Shakespeare'' is Elizabethan.
</P>
<P>
   Considered the Oscar front-runner, ``Ryan'' is returning to
theaters Feb. 5, trailing best picture awards from the New York
Film Critics Circle, the Los Angeles Film Critics, The New York
Times, Time Magazine, Entertainment Weekly and USA Today. The DGA
winner will be named March 6.Steve Murray writes for the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.

   The people trying to toss Mr. Clinton out of office now seem
faced with a task as hard as forcing the late Elvis Presley to quit
being the king.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S 'THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JAY LENO' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was this week in 1861 that the state of Georgia seceded
from the Union at the beginning of the Civil War. That was a big
year for Georgia. 1861 was also the last time the Atlanta Falcons
ever won a Championship game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks like Latrell Sprewell is going to the Knicks. I think
he'll fit in there. He said he's gonna have to learn to wait 'til
the playoffs like the other Knicks do until he starts choking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you like the President or not, you've got to admit it
was a great speech. The President was interrupted by applause 95
times. The last person in Washington that was interrupted that many
times for applause was Monica Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And Clinton came out with some surprising employment figures.
Most surprising: he still has a job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some happy news. Marie Osmond is pregnant again. I believe
this will be her 600th child.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know who also is pregnant? Cindy Crawford. I want to wish
her a congratulations. And you know what they say when a supermodel
gets pregnant: Now she's gonna be eating for one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mattel is planning to release two new dolls this year based on
the Olsen twins, Mary Kate and Ashley. Overbearing stage mom sold
separately.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In L.A., city officials have finally decided to add fluoride
to our city's tap water. A lot of people are protesting. They don't
want any chemical additives in their water. Only in L.A. can you
get people with silicone breasts, collagen lips, people with hair
implants, but they don't want anything fake in their water.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Freezing cold temperatures all around the country. There was
so much ice in the rivers around Washington D.C, they said it's
actually safe now for Ted Kennedy to drive women home.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S 'LATE NIGHT WITH CONAN O'BRIEN' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Several Republicans chose not to attend the State of the Union
address because they felt it would be 'hypocritical' to applaud
President Clinton. Instead they spent a quiet night at home with
their mistresses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Reportedly, Mick Jagger is now claiming that he was never
married to Jerri Hall because their wedding on the island of Bali
wasn't legal. Not only that, but experts say Keith Richards'
marriage may not be legal because he's been dead for 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point during his State of the Union speech last night,
President Clinton looked up at Hillary and mouthed the words 'I
love you.' Which is fine, but then he did the same thing to four
other women.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day at an airport, Monica Lewinsky told a fan that
she doesn't give autographs because she's famous for the wrong
reasons. Although, Monica did offer to give the fan oral sex.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, Cindy Crawford and her husband announced they're
expecting a baby. The father said he doesn't care if it's a boy or
a girl, he's just happy he gets to have sex with Cindy Crawford.''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to a recent statistic, Americans use 200 billion
Kleenex a year. That number would be a lot higher, but technically
George Michael is British.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is the one-year anniversary of the day the Monica
Lewinsky scandal broke. To mark the occasion, President Clinton
sent Monica flowers and then had Betty Currie get them back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The other night, the WB network did not carry President
Clinton's State of the Union address, but instead aired the episode
of 'Felicity' when Felicity loses her virginity. Apparently,
President Clinton was furious because he couldn't watch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie Sheen announced that now that he's older and more
mature, he wants to be known as Charles Sheen. Although to hookers,
he'll still be known as Bob Smith.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan Quayle announced yesterday that he will run for president
in the year 2000. On behalf of late-night talk show hosts
everywhere, I just want to say 'Thank you.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today for the first time during the impeachment trial, the
Senators were allowed to ask questions. Strom Thurmond went first
and asked, 'Has anyone seen my blue blanket.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day in Indiana, police arrested a man for driving to
work drunk on his lawn mower. When police told him it was
inappropriate to drive a lawn mower to work the man said, 'That's
right, it's winter I should be on my Zamboni.'''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Sachs' exchange with a customs agent on his return from
Paris was on a more esoteric level.
</P>
<P>
   Agent: ``What were you doing in Paris?''
</P>
<P>
   Sachs: ``Attending a conference on the biology of behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Agent: ``I didn't know that behavior had a biology.''
</P>
<P>
   Sachs: ``Yes, for example, the brain is part of your biology and
it controls your behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Agent: ``I always thought my mother controlled my behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The man on crutches, in soiled and worn clothing, got on the F
train and began the familiar subway litany: He was hungry and in
need of help.

   The passenger next to Chester Roberts reached out and touched
the importuning man on the arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brother, you'll do a lot better if you hide those two heavy
gold chains inside your shirt,'' the passenger said. The man
smiled, followed his advice and moved on.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Gottlieb's small white poodle, Finette, attracts a good
deal of admiration on their walks in Central Park. Most people ask,
``What is his name?'' apparently assuming that all dogs are male. A
few observant types ask, ``What is her name?''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Gottlieb's favorite inquiry came from a girl of about 8.
``What is his or her name?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Ira Levinson was waiting to be seated in the tea room at the
Morgan Library one afternoon when he heard a well-dressed dowager
whisper to her husband: ``Remember, sip the tea and nibble on the
scone.''
</P>
<P>
   C.S. Hanson was shopping at Bergdorf Goodman when she heard a
silver-haired woman ask, ``Where would I find moderately priced
items?''
</P>
<P>
   Without missing a beat, the salesperson (fortunately for his or
her job, not identified) replied: ``In another store.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene: The Great American Health Bar on 57th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Participants: Fran Kaufman and Edith DeChiara, eating veggie
burgers and discussing New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Action: A younger woman sits beside them and joins their
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Young woman: ``You know, Tom Ford is building a house near where
Georgia O'Keeffe lived.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kaufman: ``Abiquiu.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Woman: ``How do you know that?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kaufman: ``I've been there.''
</P>
<P>
   Young woman: ``Do you know who Tom Ford is?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kaufman: ``Yes, the head of Gucci.''
</P>
<P>
   Young woman: ``Do you know who Georgia O'Keeffe is?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kaufman: ``Yes, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   Young woman, obviously frustrated: ``I don't suppose you know my
parents' best friend, Esteban Vicente?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kaufman: ``He's a remarkable man and a really good painter.
In fact, he flirted with me at an opening a couple of months ago,''
</P>
<P>
   Young woman: ``How do you know all these things?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeChiara: ``Oh, she knows everything and everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Young woman, determined to have the last word: ``Well, I suppose
when I get to be your age, I'll know a lot more too.''
</P>
<P>
   The application for a bartender's job at the Savoy restaurant on
Prince Street asks, ``What's in a perfect Manhattan?''
</P>
<P>
   One recent applicant wrote: ``Low-rent apartments, quality
public education, people-friendly police, no rats and Barneys back
downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   The ingenuous answer didn't merit a job offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll settle for bourbon with equal parts dry and sweet
vermouth,'' said Peter Hoffman, the owner.
</P>
<P>
   Joanna F. Shulman did a double-take when she saw the sign
displayed by a sidewalk book vendor near Lincoln Center. It read:
``BOOKS YOU'LL NEVER READ: 1 for $1, 2 for $1, 3 for $1.''
</P>
<P>
   How Times Have Changed Department: Betsy Lewis' three children,
Becca 14, Emma, 12, and Mike, 10, heaved a message-laden Evian
bottle into the Caribbean as they traveled from Virgin Gorda to
Tortolla. Their enclosure _ brief biographical sketches and their
e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   There was a long line on Mercer Street on a cold, snowy day.
Bargain hunters were waiting to be let in to Wolfman Gold's
going-out-of-business sale. Ruth Wooden and a friend were among the
waiting shoppers, many of whom were talking on cellular phones. A
young deliveryman on a wobbly bike made his way down the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who ordered Chinese?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   A woman signaled him, paid the bill and began her outdoor lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Madeline Stern, 6, sees a lot of Broadway shows. Her mother,
Laura Heller, is company manager of ``Stomp''; her father, Eric
Stern, is the musical director of ``Parade.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Madeline hadn't seen ``Cats,'' and she was interested,
but after being told that it was the longest-running show on
Broadway she voiced a serious reservation. ``Maybe I should watch a
tape first,'' she said. ``I don't know if I can sit through the
whole thing.''

from being missed by the traditional headcount. By Linda
Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   SIERRA-LEONE-TERROR (Freetown, Sierra Leone) _ ``I asked them to
kill me now,'' Mohammed Sesay remembered pleading after he was
caught by rebels gripping machetes. But they ignored him. They held
his arms flat on a tree stump. And he felt the machete fall on a
wrist, then on the other. ``This is an example to show the
president,'' the rebels told him. `` Hacking off hands and feet of
ordinary people has been a key weapon of a widespread campaign of
terror and butchery waged by rebels trying to overthrow this
ravaged country's president. In recent days, the fighting has

   &UR; BILL'S WORLD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star
</P>
<P>
   The people trying to toss Mr. Clinton out of office now seem
faced with a task as hard as forcing the late Elvis Presley to quit
being the king.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S 'THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JAY LENO' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was this week in 1861 that the state of Georgia seceded
from the Union at the beginning of the Civil War. That was a big
year for Georgia. 1861 was also the last time the Atlanta Falcons
ever won a Championship game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks like Latrell Sprewell is going to the Knicks. I think
he'll fit in there. He said he's gonna have to learn to wait 'til
the playoffs like the other Knicks do until he starts choking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you like the President or not, you've got to admit it
was a great speech. The President was interrupted by applause 95
times. The last person in Washington that was interrupted that many
times for applause was Monica Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And Clinton came out with some surprising employment figures.
Most surprising: he still has a job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some happy news. Marie Osmond is pregnant again. I believe
this will be her 600th child.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know who also is pregnant? Cindy Crawford. I want to wish
her a congratulations. And you know what they say when a supermodel
gets pregnant: Now she's gonna be eating for one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mattel is planning to release two new dolls this year based on
the Olsen twins, Mary Kate and Ashley. Overbearing stage mom sold
separately.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In L.A., city officials have finally decided to add fluoride
to our city's tap water. A lot of people are protesting. They don't
want any chemical additives in their water. Only in L.A. can you
get people with silicone breasts, collagen lips, people with hair
implants, but they don't want anything fake in their water.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Freezing cold temperatures all around the country. There was
so much ice in the rivers around Washington D.C, they said it's
actually safe now for Ted Kennedy to drive women home.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S 'LATE NIGHT WITH CONAN O'BRIEN' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Several Republicans chose not to attend the State of the Union
address because they felt it would be 'hypocritical' to applaud
President Clinton. Instead they spent a quiet night at home with
their mistresses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Reportedly, Mick Jagger is now claiming that he was never
married to Jerri Hall because their wedding on the island of Bali
wasn't legal. Not only that, but experts say Keith Richards'
marriage may not be legal because he's been dead for 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point during his State of the Union speech last night,
President Clinton looked up at Hillary and mouthed the words 'I
love you.' Which is fine, but then he did the same thing to four
other women.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day at an airport, Monica Lewinsky told a fan that
she doesn't give autographs because she's famous for the wrong
reasons. Although, Monica did offer to give the fan oral sex.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, Cindy Crawford and her husband announced they're
expecting a baby. The father said he doesn't care if it's a boy or
a girl, he's just happy he gets to have sex with Cindy Crawford.''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to a recent statistic, Americans use 200 billion
Kleenex a year. That number would be a lot higher, but technically
George Michael is British.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is the one-year anniversary of the day the Monica
Lewinsky scandal broke. To mark the occasion, President Clinton
sent Monica flowers and then had Betty Currie get them back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The other night, the WB network did not carry President
Clinton's State of the Union address, but instead aired the episode
of 'Felicity' when Felicity loses her virginity. Apparently,
President Clinton was furious because he couldn't watch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie Sheen announced that now that he's older and more
mature, he wants to be known as Charles Sheen. Although to hookers,
he'll still be known as Bob Smith.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan Quayle announced yesterday that he will run for president
in the year 2000. On behalf of late-night talk show hosts
everywhere, I just want to say 'Thank you.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today for the first time during the impeachment trial, the
Senators were allowed to ask questions. Strom Thurmond went first
and asked, 'Has anyone seen my blue blanket.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day in Indiana, police arrested a man for driving to
work drunk on his lawn mower. When police told him it was
inappropriate to drive a lawn mower to work the man said, 'That's
right, it's winter I should be on my Zamboni.'''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Sachs' exchange with a customs agent on his return from
Paris was on a more esoteric level.
</P>
<P>
   Agent: ``What were you doing in Paris?''
</P>
<P>
   Sachs: ``Attending a conference on the biology of behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Agent: ``I didn't know that behavior had a biology.''
</P>
<P>
   Sachs: ``Yes, for example, the brain is part of your biology and
it controls your behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Agent: ``I always thought my mother controlled my behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The man on crutches, in soiled and worn clothing, got on the F
train and began the familiar subway litany: He was hungry and in
need of help.
</P>
<P>
   The passenger next to Chester Roberts reached out and touched
the importuning man on the arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brother, you'll do a lot better if you hide those two heavy

train and began the familiar subway litany: He was hungry and in
need of help.
</P>
<P>
   The passenger next to Chester Roberts reached out and touched
the importuning man on the arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brother, you'll do a lot better if you hide those two heavy
gold chains inside your shirt,'' the passenger said. The man
smiled, followed his advice and moved on.

   Robin Gottlieb's small white poodle, Finette, attracts a good
deal of admiration on their walks in Central Park. Most people ask,
``What is his name?'' apparently assuming that all dogs are male. A
few observant types ask, ``What is her name?''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Gottlieb's favorite inquiry came from a girl of about 8.
``What is his or her name?'' she asked.

   C.S. Hanson was shopping at Bergdorf Goodman when she heard a
silver-haired woman ask, ``Where would I find moderately priced
items?''
</P>
<P>
   Without missing a beat, the salesperson (fortunately for his or
her job, not identified) replied: ``In another store.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene: The Great American Health Bar on 57th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Participants: Fran Kaufman and Edith DeChiara, eating veggie
burgers and discussing New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Action: A younger woman sits beside them and joins their
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Young woman: ``You know, Tom Ford is building a house near where
Georgia O'Keeffe lived.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kaufman: ``Abiquiu.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Woman: ``How do you know that?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kaufman: ``I've been there.''
</P>
<P>
   Young woman: ``Do you know who Tom Ford is?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kaufman: ``Yes, the head of Gucci.''
</P>
<P>
   Young woman: ``Do you know who Georgia O'Keeffe is?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kaufman: ``Yes, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   Young woman, obviously frustrated: ``I don't suppose you know my
parents' best friend, steban Vicente?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kaufman: ``He's a remarkable man and a really good painter.
In fact, he flirted with me at an opening a couple of months ago,''
</P>
<P>
   Young woman: ``How do you know all these things?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeChiara: ``Oh, she knows everything and everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Young woman, determined to have the last word: ``Well, I suppose
when I get to be your age, I'll know a lot more too.''
</P>
<P>
   The application for a bartender's job at the Savoy restaurant on
Prince Street asks, ``What's in a perfect Manhattan?''
</P>
<P>
   One recent applicant wrote: ``Low-rent apartments, quality
public education, people-friendly police, no rats and Barneys back
downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   The ingenuous answer didn't merit a job offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll settle for bourbon with equal parts dry and sweet
vermouth,'' said Peter Hoffman, the owner.
</P>
<P>
   Joanna F. Shulman did a double-take when she saw the sign

   How Times Have Changed Department: Betsy Lewis' three children,
Becca 14, Emma, 12, and Mike, 10, heaved a message-laden Evian

</P>
<P>
   There was a long line on Mercer Street on a cold, snowy day.
Bargain hunters were waiting to be let in to Wolfman Gold's
going-out-of-business sale. Ruth Wooden and a friend were among the
waiting shoppers, many of whom were talking on cellular phones. A
young deliveryman on a wobbly bike made his way down the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who ordered Chinese?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   A woman signaled him, paid the bill and began her outdoor lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Madeline Stern, 6, sees a lot of Broadway shows. Her mother,
Laura Heller, is company manager of ``Stomp''; her father, Eric
Stern, is the musical director of ``Parade.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Madeline hadn't seen ``Cats,'' and she was interested,
but after being told that it was the longest-running show on
Broadway she voiced a serious reservation. ``Maybe I should watch a
tape first,'' she said. ``I don't know if I can sit through the
whole thing.''

   &UR; BILL'S WORLD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star
</P>
<P>
   The people trying to toss Mr. Clinton out of office now seem
faced with a task as hard as forcing the late Elvis Presley to quit
being the king.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S 'THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JAY LENO' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was this week in 1861 that the state of Georgia seceded
from the Union at the beginning of the Civil War. That was a big
year for Georgia. 1861 was also the last time the Atlanta Falcons
ever won a Championship game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks like Latrell Sprewell is going to the Knicks. I think
he'll fit in there. He said he's gonna have to learn to wait 'til
the playoffs like the other Knicks do until he starts choking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you like the President or not, you've got to admit it
was a great speech. The President was interrupted by applause 95
times. The last person in Washington that was interrupted that many
times for applause was Monica Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And Clinton came out with some surprising employment figures.
Most surprising: he still has a job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some happy news. Marie Osmond is pregnant again. I believe
this will be her 600th child.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know who also is pregnant? Cindy Crawford. I want to wish
her a congratulations. And you know what they say when a supermodel
gets pregnant: Now she's gonna be eating for one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mattel is planning to release two new dolls this year based on
the Olsen twins, Mary Kate and Ashley. Overbearing stage mom sold
separately.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In L.A., city officials have finally decided to add fluoride
to our city's tap water. A lot of people are protesting. They don't
want any chemical additives in their water. Only in L.A. can you
get people with silicone breasts, collagen lips, people with hair
implants, but they don't want anything fake in their water.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Freezing cold temperatures all around the country. There was
so much ice in the rivers around Washington D.C, they said it's
actually safe now for Ted Kennedy to drive women home.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S 'LATE NIGHT WITH CONAN O'BRIEN' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Several Republicans chose not to attend the State of the Union
address because they felt it would be 'hypocritical' to applaud
President Clinton. Instead they spent a quiet night at home with
their mistresses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Reportedly, Mick Jagger is now claiming that he was never
married to Jerri Hall because their wedding on the island of Bali
wasn't legal. Not only that, but experts say Keith Richards'
marriage may not be legal because he's been dead for 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point during his State of the Union speech last night,
President Clinton looked up at Hillary and mouthed the words 'I
love you.' Which is fine, but then he did the same thing to four
other women.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day at an airport, Monica Lewinsky told a fan that
she doesn't give autographs because she's famous for the wrong
reasons. Although, Monica did offer to give the fan oral sex.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, Cindy Crawford and her husband announced they're
expecting a baby. The father said he doesn't care if it's a boy or
a girl, he's just happy he gets to have sex with Cindy Crawford.''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to a recent statistic, Americans use 200 billion
Kleenex a year. That number would be a lot higher, but technically
George Michael is British.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is the one-year anniversary of the day the Monica
Lewinsky scandal broke. To mark the occasion, President Clinton
sent Monica flowers and then had Betty Currie get them back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The other night, the WB network did not carry President
Clinton's State of the Union address, but instead aired the episode
of 'Felicity' when Felicity loses her virginity. Apparently,
President Clinton was furious because he couldn't watch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie Sheen announced that now that he's older and more
mature, he wants to be known as Charles Sheen. Although to hookers,
he'll still be known as Bob Smith.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan Quayle announced yesterday that he will run for president
in the year 2000. On behalf of late-night talk show hosts
everywhere, I just want to say 'Thank you.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today for the first time during the impeachment trial, the
Senators were allowed to ask questions. Strom Thurmond went first
and asked, 'Has anyone seen my blue blanket.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day in Indiana, police arrested a man for driving to
work drunk on his lawn mower. When police told him it was
inappropriate to drive a lawn mower to work the man said, 'That's
right, it's winter I should be on my Zamboni.'''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Sachs' exchange with a customs agent on his return from
Paris was on a more esoteric level.
</P>
<P>
   Agent: ``What were you doing in Paris?''
</P>
<P>
   Sachs: ``Attending a conference on the biology of behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Agent: ``I didn't know that behavior had a biology.''
</P>
<P>
   Sachs: ``Yes, for example, the brain is part of your biology and
it controls your behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Agent: ``I always thought my mother controlled my behavior.''
</P>
<P>

BRENDAN FRASER IS HAVING A `BLAST' 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 Includes a color slide of Brendan Fraser with Alicia Silverstone in
a scene from ``Blast From the Past.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``George, George, George of the Jungle, watch out for that ...
knee?''
 &HT;    No joke. To Brendan Fraser, star of the 1998 hit film, nowhere
is safe.
 &HT;    ``I'll be standing there,'' he explains, ``and all of a sudden a
kamikaze kid will come running at me full force, screaming `George,
George, George of the Jungle ... ' They're crashing into me all
over the world. I would like to send the children of the world
helmets!''
 &HT;    Call it the price of fame, or at least of a $100 million
box-office hit. Given ``George'' and the critical raves for ``Gods
and Monsters'' (1998), Fraser's last year has crystallized one of
Hollywood's most eclectic careers, one that pairs him one day with
Pauly Shore and the next with Sir Ian McKellen.
 &HT;    Don't look for it to get any more homogeneous, either. His 1999
slate includes ``Blast From the Past,'' an odd-man-out romantic
comedy about a guy who emerges from a bomb shelter after 35 years
underground. That's due to open Feb. 5, and then in May he'll be a
modern-day Indiana Jones type in ``The Mummy.'' Rounding out the
year, next fall he'll be back in doofus mode for ``Dudley
Do-Right.''
 &HT;    That likeable-but-dense persona is the actor's dominant public
image, but over breakfast at Los Angeles' Four Seasons hotel, it's
no dumb lug who shows up. Fraser is a handsome, articulate,
6-foot-2-inch intellectual. The shoulders of a linebacker are
compacted into a neat blue sweater and slacks.
 &HT;    Premiere magazine once called him ``a prime specimen of male
musculature,'' but Fraser doesn't focus on his physique.
 &HT;    ``I'm one of those who seeks to find a kindred spirit with love
and art and commerce,'' he says. ``That's what it truly means to be
an artist.''
 &HT;    And if it helps to be good-looking, well, he isn't complaining
either.
 &HT;    ``I was intimidated on the first day of shooting `Mrs.
Winterbourne' (1996),'' he recalls, ``but the first time I met her,
Shirley MacLaine grabbed me by the face and said, `Oh, you're so
cute.'''
 &HT;    Oddly, Fraser reports, it isn't the screaming-teen set that most
adores him, but older women _ and, of course, their
``Jungle''-fevered children.
 &HT;    ``I get e-mails where women call me soulful,'' the actor says.
``I think it's wonderful. It's flattering. And very often that
demographic of women have children who love me, too. These women
will tell me the kids watch `George' like it's on some sort of
continuous-play loop.''
 &HT;    ``Blast from the Past'' attracted him because he liked the role,
he says. Fraser plays a young man whose parents (Sissy Spacek and
Christopher Walken) freaked out during the Cuban missile crisis of
1962 and have been underground ever since.
 &HT;    When he finally ventures to the surface, he finds the world a
much different place. And, oh yes, he meets a nice girl who looks
like Alicia Silverstone.
 &HT;    ``We fall in love,'' he says, ``and, without spoiling the
ending, I think it's a rather touching fable about what it means to
honor one's parents.''
 &HT;    As opposed to honoring one's mummy, which is the question in his
summer film.
 &HT;    ``It has a strong sense of humor,'' Fraser says of ``The
Mummy.'' ``We harken back to the high-camp qualities of the
original, and at the same time incorporate elements of action and
adventure.''
 &HT;    The shoot took him to London and Morocco, where he spent several
days astride a camel.
 &HT;    ``I was still in good shape after `George,''' Fraser says with a
laugh, ``but nothing prepares you for 12 hours on a camel.''
 &HT;    Through the early 1990s, Fraser struggled to find an image that
would reflect not only his beefy charm but also the sense of
goofiness which leavened it. The unifying factor, he says, is that
whether he's playing an earnest prep-school student in ``School
Ties'' (1992) or an off-the-wall baseball prospect in ``The Scout''
(1994), he's usually a bit lost in the world around him.
 &HT;    ``I love playing fish-out-of-water men,'' he says. ``I love to
act roles that allow me to make discoveries about the world as if
it was the first time my eyes were ever opened. I find those roles
very organic. It's almost a childlike wonder and awe that you can
bring to the work, whether it's a guy frozen in a block of ice like
Encino Man or a cartoon monkey.''
 &HT;    Even the doofuses have their serious side, he adds.
 &HT;    ``Take George of the Jungle,'' he says. ``To me, he's not some
dunderhead _ he's a benign, benevolent defender of the weak and
protector of the innocent. And he also happens to be easy on the
eyes.''
 &HT;    And on the box office, with predictable results for Fraser's
career.
 &HT;    ``In the last two years things have snowballed exponentially,''
he says. ``My career now is like that tiny end of the whip. You
know that tiny little snap that came from the big crack? Well,
`George' was that snap. It set off a chain of events that have
forced me to make very specific decisions about shaping the
trajectory of my career.''
 &HT;    Among other things, that meant avoid shirtless roles that would
pigeonhole him as a hunk _ though he does appear briefly
all-but-naked in ``Gods and Monsters.''
 &HT;    ``It's so dangerous,'' he says. ``If the nude human form is
giving more information, then fine. But I like people to spin their
imaginations. The off-camera action you can imagine is always more
dangerous than what you see before your eyes.''
 &HT;    The big picture comes naturally to Fraser, who grew up as the
son of a Canadian travel executive who moved the family frequently,
including stops in Ottawa, Indianapolis, Detroit, Seattle, London
and Rome. Theater was always part of his life.
 &HT;    ``Most of the time I grew up in Europe, and we'd go off to
holiday in London,'' the actor recalls. ``A true love affair with
the theater was born. I remember people saying I was too young for
the masterworks, but I always felt like I had an old soul.''
 &HT;    That soul took him to the Cornish Institute in Seattle and,
after graduation, to film work in ``Encino Man'' (1992) and
``School Ties.'' He soon earned a reputation for being the best
thing in bad movies such as ``Airheads'' (1994), ``The Scout,''
``The Passion of Darkly Noon'' (1995) and ``Mrs. Winterbourne.''
 &HT;    ``I always made the best of what I was offered,'' he says.
 &HT;    Then came ``George,'' with its box-office magic, and ``Gods and
Monsters,'' with its rumors of a best-supporting-actor Oscar
nomination. Brendan Fraser, people began to say, has finally
arrived.
 &HT;    ``I don't want to pat myself on the back,'' Fraser says, ``but I
do think that films work in some moments. In some moments they
don't work. The lessons I've learned from what does work influences
the next part. The good work speaks loud and clear to the muse
within an artist.''
 &HT;    The other half of his recent upswing is on the home front, where
he recently married Afton Smith. Hesitant to discuss personal
issues, Fraser actually blushes when her name comes up.
 &HT;    ``I do believe there is one person out there for everyone and I
found her,'' he says. ``I do believe in true love and destiny. I
also love the mystery of love.''
 &HT;    Lying ahead of Fraser are producer/star duties on a heroin drama
called ``Zebra Stripes,'' and presumably a sequel to ``George of
the Jungle.''
 &HT;    And no, he isn't sick of that song.
 &HT;    ``Come here and listen to my heart,'' he says, humming the tune.
``My heart is going, `BOOM-boom-BOOM-boom-boom-BOOM-boom.' That's
how excited I am these days about everything.''

 Includes a color slide of country singer Lee Ann Womack. 
 By JANET E. WILLIAMS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's called the sophomore jinx: The more successful an artist's
``breakthrough'' project is, the greater the pressure to match or
even top it with the second one.
 &HT;    Just ask country singer Lee Ann Womack, whose second album,
``Some Things I Know'' (Decca, 1998), seems to have beaten the
odds.
 &HT;    ``I certainly felt the pressure,'' the singer says. ``I think
everybody does. But hopefully, we matched up to the first album.''
 &HT;    The commitments stemming from the success of her debut album,
``Lee Ann Womack'' (1997) _ including, most notably, an extended
1998 tour opening for George Strait _ left her less time to work on
``Some Things I Know,'' and Womack says the album may have suffered
as a result.
 &HT;    ``Well, honestly I felt rushed,'' she admits. ``It was different
for me having to make records while I was touring. I am sure it's
something I'll get used to.''
 &HT;    In particular, the tour cut into the time and energy she needed
for songwriting, which is why the new album is made up of songs by
other writers. Most were recommended to her by Frank Liddell, who
is not only Decca's director of artists and repertoire but also her
steady companion of the past two years.
 &HT;    ``I didn't have as much time myself to get out and look, but
thankfully Frank is such a great song guy,'' she says. ``I was able
to rely on him.''
 &HT;    Ultimately the decisions on which songs to include were
Womack's, but she says the process was an exciting one.
 &HT;    ```A Little Past Little Rock,' `Don't Tell Me,' each one of them
I listened to a lot before I made my final decision,'' she says.
``These are the ones I knew were great songs, as well as `Preacher
Won't Have to Lie' and `I'd Rather Have What We Had.'''
 &HT;    As usual, she says, the hardest part was actually deciding which
songs not to include. There were some great songs which, for one
reason or another, simply didn't fit onto the album.
 &HT;    All the same, Womack reports, the biggest impact of dealing with
so many great songs by other people was to rekindle her own desire
to write. During the winter, she's working on songs that may be
included in her next album. Her tour schedule has eased since New
Year's, offering her more time for herself and her writing.
 &HT;    Her most important winter project will not be appearing on her
next album, however: On Jan. 5, she and Liddell welcomed a
daughter, Anna Lise Womack.
 &HT;    Anna Lise is the singer's second child, joining 7-year-old
Aubrie, her daughter with former husband Jason Sellers. Aubrie
entered public school in September 1998, after a year of home
schooling.
 &HT;    ``She's doing great,'' Womack says enthusiastically. ``I
couldn't believe it, because actually I expected it to be a
struggle, and there was no struggle at all. So I was pleasantly
surprised.''
 &HT;    The singer made the decision to put Aubrie into school instead
of continuing home schooling reluctantly, but she says that once
she began touring it was inevitable. Life on the road is demanding
even for adults, but for a 7-year-old it is close to impossible.
 &HT;    ``I just felt like she needed to focus on herself for a while,''
Womack says, ``and not on mom and dad and their careers.''
 &HT;    Education is a priority for Womack, a voracious reader who took
stacks of books with her on tour, even during a recent trip to
Switzerland for _ believe it or not _ the Gstaad Country Music
Festival.
 &HT;    ``I go through phases,'' she says. ``Lately I've been reading a
lot of classics. My whole band and I just got through reading `To
Kill A Mockingbird.' We sort of started a little book club there,
and we all rented the movie and discussed it and everything. It was
a lot of fun.
 &HT;    ``Then I read `The Pearl' while I was in Switzerland,'' the
singer adds. ``Now I'm in the middle of a book called `A
Confederacy of Dunces.' I like it _ I'm about halfway through it. I
want to read `Cold Mountain.'''
 &HT;    The band ``book club'' was an offbeat idea that she had felt her
road crew would enjoy, and she was right.
 &HT;    ``Everyone was gung ho,'' she says gleefully. ``It was just kind
of a fun thing. We haven't started a second book yet, but I'm sure
we will. It was just so funny to watch everybody get offstage, run
take their shower, get in their bunks and start reading.
 &HT;    ``I really want Aubrie to see us reading and enjoying it,'' she
adds. ``Hopefully she will too.''
 &HT;    Yes, but what about that country-music festival in _ believe it
or not _ Switzerland?
 &HT;    No lie, Womack says.
 &HT;    ``It was great. It was my first time out of the country, and it
is beautiful over there,'' the singer says enthusiastically. ``We
had a little bit of time, very little, but it was raining, so we
didn't really get to do a whole lot. I just remember thinking how
beautiful it was.
 &HT;    ``It surprises me that so many people speak English, everywhere
you go,'' she adds. ``We just expect everyone to speak English, and
they do! I just wonder why we don't know more languages here. That
was kind of surprising to me.''
 &HT;    But are the _ believe it or not _ Swiss really into American
country music? Womack says they are.
 &HT;    ``Well, it was kind of odd during the shows,'' she concedes,
``because they don't clap a lot during the song. They clap at the
end.''
 &HT;    Since her 1997 debut, Womack has enjoyed many exciting moments.
Touring with Strait may have been the most memorable of all,
though.
 &HT;    ``George is responsible for picking who will be on there,'' she
says. ``Because he had said a couple of things in interviews about
my music, that was what made me think that maybe he'd ask me to do
the tour.
 &HT;    ``I'll tell you, though, he's a businessman, and he's not going
to do something unless it is right for him,'' the singer says. ``So
I don't feel like it was a favor or anything.
 &HT;    ``I'm definitely in awe of him,'' she adds. ``And the tour _ the
crowds were so huge and the venues were so big, the whole thing was
overwhelming. The thought of being on tour with him was great.''
 &HT;    In addition to Strait, Womack has also shared the stage with Tim
McGraw, John Michael Montgomery, Alan Jackson, Faith Hill and a
number of other top stars of today's country music. To her, she
says, these occasions are prime learning experiences _ ``sort of
`How to Put On a Show 101.'''
 &HT;    ``I do go out and watch,'' Womack says. ``Certainly with George
and Alan both, I learned that you don't have to jump around to
entertain people. I really like that, because that's more me,
hopefully singing great songs. So I try to take a lesson from those
guys in that.
 &HT;    ``George Strait is the most entertaining show I've ever seen,''
she says. ``Although he doesn't do bells and whistles, there is
still something so charming and natural. And the great songs and
his demeanor, it's entertainment.''

SECRECY (Washington) - Democratic Sens. Tom Harkin and Paul

entertainment package.)

 Includes a color slide of Whoopi Goldberg in a scene from
``Hollywood Squares.'' 
 By DAVID KRONKE  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new ``Hollywood Squares'' is pretty much like the old
``Squares,'' except that the celebrities occupying the giant
tic-tac-toe board aren't absolutely screaming, ``My career's in the
toilet!''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, they're still not proclaiming, ``This is the
best career choice I've ever made!''
</P>
<P>
   From 1966 to 1982, the original incarnation of the series
featured nominal stars as well as has-beens and never-weres. George
Gobel and Dean Martin would pretend to be crocked when they did the
show, as if that's the only way they could bear to appear on it.
</P>
<P>
   The short-lived, late-1980s version dug even lower, mining the
squalid dregs of celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   But King World's new, hype-driven series features Whoopi
Goldberg _ an actual Oscar-winner! _ in the center square, and
seeks to surround her with tonier celebs such as Sharon Stone,
Whitney Houston and Goldberg's ``Comic Relief'' buddies Robin
Williams and Billy Crystal, befitting her standing in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg herself carries a producer's credit for the show,
mainly because it's her Rolodex and her clout that draw the stars.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the show's quizmania, we've decided to finish
this story in quiz format. The answers are below _ but no peeking,
now!
 &UR; UNANSWERED QUESTIONS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + BONE VOYAGE.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg: ``In the old days, people looked at these shows as
boneyards. That's no longer the case, because you have people like
Helen Hunt, who is on a show, who collects an Oscar and goes back
to her show. I do it, Glenn Close does it. Lots of us go back and
forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the onus is off when we call people and say, `Will you come
and do this?'''
</P>
<P>
   Question: What does this statement suggest?
</P>
<P>
   a) Celebrities are genuinely anxious to appear on game shows.
</P>
<P>
   b) Celebrities would jump off a cliff if their friends were
doing it too.
</P>
<P>
   c) Boneyards have merely gotten a little glitzier in the past 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   + REALLY BEAUTIFUL.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg: ``King World offered me the opportunity not to have to
do a lot of stuff that I've been contemplating. I don't want to
work as hard anymore. I really don't _ I want to have fun now.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they offered me a really beautiful amount of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Question: What does she mean by this?
</P>
<P>
   A) ``I'm truly dedicated to making this television experience a
deeply edifying one for viewers and an important spiritual way
station in my own journey through this life.''
</P>
<P>
   B) ``I already have an Oscar and a Grammy, but no Emmy _ ahhh,
who are we kidding?''
</P>
<P>
   C) ``Hey, I've raised money for the homeless, so I deserve to be
able to coast for a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   + THE CHEESE FACTOR.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg: ``We want the show to have integrity, so that people
will want to come. We don't want a whole lot of cheese. You gotta
have a little cheese, you know, but I'll provide the cheese. This
way, it won't be processed _ it'll be creamy cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   Question: In light of the previous question, what are we to make
of this statement?
</P>
<P>
   A) Many celebrities are lactose-intolerant.
</P>
<P>
   B) Someone who can coast and instill integrity simultaneously is
a force to be reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   C) The American Dairy Council might want to rethink hiring
Goldberg as an authorized cheese manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   + THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING IMPORTANT.
</P>
<P>
   King World CEO Michael King: ``This could be one of the most
important shows in television to reach a major audience. This could
be, seriously, one of the most important shows out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Question: When he said this, he was:
</P>
<P>
   A) out of his mind.
</P>
<P>
   B) speaking in terms of celebrities wanting to promote projects.
</P>
<P>
   C) B) _ but still, let's face it, A).
</P>
<P>
   + COMPARISONS ARE ...
</P>
<P>
   Question: Goldberg is to former ``Squares'' host Paul Lynde as
Patrick Swayze and Bobcat Goldthwait are to:
</P>
<P>
   A) Tom Wolfe and Stephen King.
</P>
<P>
   B) a roadhouse bouncer and an alcoholic clown.
</P>
<P>
   C) John Davidson and Wally Cox.
</P>
<P>
   + LOOK BACK IN AMBIGUITY.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, on her favorite memories of the old ``Hollywood
Squares'' show and how it would influence the new version: ``I have
no idea. And, always Paul Lynde comes to mind. Always. Because
there's just, you know, there are people who have it, and there
aren't a lot of those people around anymore. And so, you think of
all those wonderful things that would come out of his mouth. And no
one seemed to be upset about it, which makes it perfect for me. You
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Question: What does this reveal?
</P>
<P>
   A) Goldberg's ability to respond to a question without actually
saying anything.
</P>
<P>
   B) How fortunate it is the show isn't called ``Hollywood
Rhombuses.''
</P>
<P>
   C) That Goldberg probably didn't really watch the old series,
but still expects people to watch her on the new one.
</P>
<P>
   + DUMB AND DUMBER?
</P>
<P>
   Question: For which of the following contingents does Goldberg
have the least respect, based on her quotations below?
</P>
<P>
   A) Her fellow stars: ``You don't have to be a rocket scientist
to play this game ... All the answers are written out. Even the
most dense of stars can come and play this show.''
</P>
<P>
   B) The contestants: ``There'll be nine really famous people and
two 15-minute people.''
</P>
<P>
   C) Viewers.
</P>
<P>
   + IN JEOPARDY OF BEING CRUSHED BY THE WHEEL?
</P>
<P>
   Question: ``Hollywood Squares'' has enjoyed a little bump in the
ratings lately, but still has less than half the viewers of such
syndicated game shows as ``Wheel of Fortune'' and ``Jeopardy.''
This suggests that:
</P>
<P>
   A) Vanna White and Alex Trebek should occupy squares.
</P>
<P>
   B) Goldberg should've taken a job spinning letters on ``Wheel.''
</P>
<P>
   C) viewers prefer contests that are much, much easier or much,
much harder than the precise degree of difficulty offered on
``Hollywood Squares.''
 &UR; UNQUESTIONED ANSWERS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All the questions have the same answer: straight Cs _ which is
also our report card so far on these ``Squares.''

 Includes a color slide of Rachael Leigh Cook in a scene from
``She's All That.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Rachael Leigh Cook may not be the busiest actress you've never
heard of, but she's trying.
 &HT;    And she wouldn't mind you hearing about her, either.
 &HT;    ``I've done 10 films,'' says Cook, a tiny, raven-haired
19-year-old, as she relaxes on the edge of a bed at Manhattan's
Essex House hotel. ``I feel weird even saying that, because a few
of them came and went, a couple of them haven't come out yet, a few
probably will go to video and a couple of others may never be
released anywhere.
 &HT;    ``Sometimes it's frustrating that the films aren't out or aren't
being seen,'' she adds, ``and sometimes it's probably for the best,
in those cases where the result didn't live up to the director's
vision.''
 &HT;    Among those films are ``The Babysitters Club'' (1995), ``The
House of Yes'' (1997) and ``Living Out Loud'' (1998), which fall
into Cook's ``came and went'' category. ``Eighteenth Angel'' (1998)
skipped right to video, and she has several upcoming releases,
including ``Strike,'' ``Hi-Line'' and ``She's All That,'' which
arrives at theaters nationwide on Jan. 29.
 &HT;    A romantic comedy targeted at the high-school/college-age crowd,
``She's All That'' stars Cook as Laney, a social misfit whom the
school god (Freddie Prinze Jr.) bets he can transform into
prom-queen material. Call it ``Pretty in Pink Meets Reality Bites
Meets My Fair Lady.''
 &HT;    ``I hadn't heard that one before, but I like it,'' Cook says,
laughing. ``It's got a little bit of everything, but it's
different.
 &HT;    ``Laney has more confidence than Eliza Dolittle did, for
example,'' she says. ``I loved `16 Candles' (1984), `Breakfast
Club' (1985) and `Pretty in Pink' (1986), but if people are going
to use those films as comparisons to `She's All That,' I'd say
Laney is more Ally Sheedy than Molly Ringwald.''
 &HT;    Cook and Prinze were already friends, having met while both were
in ``The House of Yes,'' though they had no scenes together. And
she loved the script.
 &HT;    ``I read `She's All That' and it was really good,'' Cook says.
``I've been getting a lot of teen-film scripts, and most of them
weren't good.
 &HT;    ``I think somebody did a survey, and the result of it was that
there weren't any films for girls,'' she adds. ``So someone
realized that there'd be a huge audience if someone catered to
them. So I started getting all of these scripts.
 &HT;    ``One of them was `She's All That.' It made me laugh out loud,
and I never do that.''
 &HT;    If audience reaction at a recent screening filled with
high-schoolers is any indication, ``She's All That'' should do just
fine with its target audience. Still, the casting of Cook, who's
sporting form-fitting leather pants and a bright-blue jacket, in
the ugly-duckling role defies credibility.
 &HT;    Cook smiles.
 &HT;    ``It's the old saying, `Hollywood's version of an unattractive
person is an attractive person in glasses,''' she says. ``I think
that's hilarious.
 &HT;    ``But it wasn't like that on this movie. They gave me a una-brow
and the messy hair, and the glasses and those clothes,'' she says
with a grimace. ``When they gave me all that stuff, I took on this
whole other persona.
 &HT;    ``It wasn't so much that Laney was nasty-looking, as she was
very scary and inaccessible,'' she adds. ``In addition to not
caring about what she looks like, she doesn't care what anybody
thinks, and she calls herself an outcast.''
 &HT;    Cook likes the movie more than she expected, she says. It worked
even better on screen than it had on the page.
 &HT;    ``I think that amazed everybody,'' she says. ``You kind of know
what's going to happen, but, come on, that's the beauty of it. It's
happy and romantic and funny, and there's a message. Whether or not
you're Laney, there are Laneys out there and she has many faces.''
 &HT;    So does Cook, but to date they've all been unknown.
 &HT;    ``I'm from Minneapolis, Minn., born and raised,'' she says,
cheerfully filling in the gaps. ``I was doing print modeling, on
and off, from the time I was about 11 to 14. Then, when I got a
little older, I did a part in a short film that was being shot in
Minneapolis.
 &HT;    ``I loved doing it, and evidently I wasn't terrible,'' she says,
laughing. ``The film got into the hands of a manager, a woman who's
a little bit psychic and really ambitious, and she asked me if I
wanted to come out to Los Angeles and give acting a shot.
 &HT;    ``So I moved out to L.A. about three years ago,'' she says.
``The first week in L.A., I got a movie and an agent. It floored me
_ It was a little too easy.
 &HT;    ``I probably should have been scared about going to L.A., but I
was too naive,'' Cook says in retrospect. ``Now it seems kind of
strange. I wonder what my parents went through when they said `OK,'
but I was fine.''
 &HT;    Acting may have been a natural career choice: Growing up, Cook
says, she considered herself an unusually good liar. She didn't lie
a lot, but when she needed to she could fib with the best of them.
Now, essentially, she lies for a living.
 &HT;    ``When acting became a possibility,'' she adds, ``it occurred to
me that to act you have to say things pretty much the way you'd say
them in real life, except that you already know what you're going
to say. That made it simple.
 &HT;    ``Acting is taking on characteristics of other people who are
inside you, and you have those characteristics in you whether or
not you're an actor.''
 &HT;    Cook suddenly laughs.
 &HT;    ``There's a difference between lying to a person and lying to a
camera,'' she says. ``I feel bad when I lie to someone else, but
I'm happy when I'm acting.
 &HT;    ``When you're in makeup and in costume, when you're acting with
another person, it's not a calculated thing, for me at least, even
if it's all scripted.''
 &HT;    Next stop after New York will be North Carolina, where Cook is
shooting a recurring role on the television series ``Dawson's
Creek.''
 &HT;    Later this year, the comedy ``Strike,'' with Kirsten Dunst and
Gaby Hoffman, will be released. Another of Cook's long-completed
films, ``Hi-Line,'' was chosen for the 1999 Sundance Film Festival
and seems likely to find a distributor soon.
 &HT;    ``That's set in freezing-cold Montana, present day, in a really
small town,'' Cook says. ``The `Hi-Line' refers to a stretch of
railway that runs around Montana.
 &HT;    ``It's about not being who you think you are, and it's also an
unlikely love story,'' she adds. ``Ryan Losio is in it with me, and
he's really good. I'm actually dating Ryan.''
 &HT;    Away from movie and television sets, Cook hangs out with Losio
and tries to lead a normal life. At least for the moment, since
``She's All That'' may change everything.
 &HT;    ``I don't think stardom is a good thing at all,'' Cook says
hesitantly. ``I lose a lot of parts to people who are famous. It
happens all the time, all week long.
 &HT;    ``To tell you the truth, I really don't want to be a star,'' she
says. ``I do want to try to make a living as an actress. I'm going
to try, but the truth is _ and nobody says this _ that it won't
work out for most of us. We're lucky if we get some work, save some
money and do OK.
 &HT;    ``If I end up hawking skin-care products on QVC in a couple of
years, that's OK _ I'll have had my run,'' Cook says. ``But I plan
to try my hardest to stick around and do good work. That's for
sure.''

 &HT;    Turner letting his land return to nature
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ted Turner sounds off about his favorite subject _ the
environment _ in interviews this month with Audubon ($5) and E: The
Environmental Magazine ($3.95). In an entertaining cover story in
Audubon, writer Donovan Webster visits Turner at his Montana ranch
to learn about America's largest private landowner's plan to
undevelop his property. Starting with 13 ranches and plantations,
Turner is attempting to return his land to the way it was before
white settlers arrived. His plan is to reintroduce wolves and other
native predators, replace cattle with bison and bighorn sheep, and
remove any grasses or plants that aren't native to the area.
</P>
<P>
   In a Q&AMP;A in E magazine, Turner talks about what he and wife Jane
Fonda are doing to conserve energy and resources. ``I drive a
medium-size car, a Ford Taurus,'' Turner says. ``And when I'm out
on my ranches, I drive a very low-horsepower Land Rover.'' And, he
adds, when he's at home, he goes around turning out any lights that
aren't being used. ``We should be driving smaller cars and living
in smaller homes. I'm a billionaire and my main residence in
Atlanta is 700 square feet, and I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Redesigning the skyline: Rodney Mims Cook Jr. was not a
character in Tom Wolfe's ``A Man in Full,'' but perhaps he should
have been. Over lunch at the Piedmont Driving Club, the designer
tells The New Yorker ($3) architecture critic Paul Goldberger of
his plans to remake the whole cityscape of Atlanta in a classical
style. Cook, who was instrumental in creating the Prince Charles
monument at Pershing Point, is planning an office building in the
lot behind the monument that will have a facade inspired by the
Farnese Palace in Italy. Cook's architectural ideas have met
resistance, in the past he says, because of ``a hostility to
beauty.'' Goldberger agrees there is a schizophrenic aspect to the
city's architecture. ``Not for nothing did Tom Wolfe portray
Charlie Croker as living in an old mansion in Buckhead while making
his money as a builder of glass office towers along the interstate.
. . . Classical architecture is what you live in, and modern
architecture is what you work in.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Madam president: According to the latest Newsweek poll,
America is ready for a woman president. Why, then, asks Strawberry
Saroyan in George ($2.95), does the women's political movement
refuse to believe in its own power? Saroyan concludes that a
perception problem exists because activists don't want to let go of
a cause to which they have dedicated their lives.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Good work: If you think the same kinds of jobs will be
available in the 21st century, Newsweek ($3.50) suggests you think
again. Loyalty is dead, says Robert Reich, former labor secretary,
and the number of self-employed workers will soar. One of the free
agents interviewed is James Oxendine, a former staffer at the
Martin Luther King Jr. Center in Atlanta. Oxendine quit his job to
launch a community service group and waited for his phone to ring.
Three years later, with much of his retirement income depleted,
he's finally getting enough business to survive.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Clinton's game plan: Time ($2.95) plasters a smirking Bill
Clinton on its cover this week with an accompanying article about
the president's dazzling campaign to survive. Not since a Redskins
game, Time says, has Washington seen such a relentless march
through mud. Even with the fumbles, Clinton appears headed for a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ivana's style: Ivana's Living in Style ($3.95), a new magazine
for America's women, was launched this week by Ivana Trump and
Globe Communications Corp., an international publisher based in
Boca Raton, Fla. ``We're dedicated to helping folks who love
gracious living but don't have the time _ or the patience _ to hand
paint a vase,'' says Trump, who will be editor in chief.

40 CHRISTIANS REPORTED KILLED BY MUSLIM MOB IN INDONESIA
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMBON, Indonesia _ At least 40 Christian villagers, including
women and children, were killed in Indonesia last week, reportedly
by a mob of Muslims seeking revenge for earlier clashes, officials
and a local Roman Catholic priest said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Cornelius Bohm, a Dutch-born priest based in Ambon,
said the attack occurred in Telagakodok, 25 miles north of Ambon,
situated on an island of the same name in the Moluccas, after
Muslims in a nearby town learned that mosques had been burned in
Ambon at the outset of the clashes last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The official death toll from five days of rioting, which spread
to outlying areas around Ambon and the neighboring island of
Senana, now stands at more than 50, although local church and
government officials say the final death toll could be much higher.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 5,000 soldiers and policemen deployed to restore
order, thousands of people who sought sanctuary in army and police
compounds last week are returning home to this once picturesque
port town, parts of which look like a war zone.
</P>
<P>
   Along the waterfront among the ruins of the gutted three-story
fish market, dogs scavenged in in piles of garbage, burned out
kiosks and crates of rotten lobster. Municipal tractors and trucks
were clearing roads choked with tons of debris, including burned
tire barricades and shells of burned cars and motorbikes.
</P>
<P>
   Universities, schools, banks, shops and clinics remain closed,
causing food shortages and creating fears of public health
problems, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The town is under military curfew, and the first group of
journalists was allowed to visit on Monday to view the damage. The
road between the airport and town passes through some of the
worst-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Latuheru, 46, a Christian, emerged from the ruins of his
home in the village of Nania, where in better times about 1,000
Muslims and Christians lived together harmoniously. Almost the
entire village has been burned.
</P>
<P>
   ``People from outside came here and started smashing things
up,'' he said. ``They went away, and we thought it was safe, but
they came back and burned my home.''
</P>
<P>
   Bohm, who has spent 32 years in the region, said the military
had been sent to Telagakodok. Details of the killings, on Thursday,
emerged last week when villagers approached another Catholic
priest.
</P>
<P>
   All the victims were Christian emigres from the southeastern
part of the region and included one pregnant woman, the priest said
he had been told. He said other people had been decapitated or
speared and hacked to death. His account was confirmed by a senior
government official, who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Residents and police and government officials said that at the
height of the rioting, an unknown number of people were beaten to
death near the waterfront and their bodies thrown into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   At the military police compound, 70 Muslims from 10 families
have been taking shelter for a week from Christian gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Long-simmering animosity to migrants from other islands is a
major cause of the Ambon violence. But some church leaders say
Muslim and Christian communities, whose members have lived in near
harmony on Ambon for decades, have been forced to take sides after
other recent religious clashes.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's worst economic recession in 30 years, a sharp
increase in law-and-order problems after student-led riots in
Jakarta and the resignation of President Suharto have all
contributed to the instability.

   WASHINGTON _ Federal agencies lose track of assets, squander
billions of dollars on faulty computers, and run programs that are
easy targets for fraud, says a new report listing 26 areas prone to
waste and abuse in the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Despite highly touted efforts by the Clinton administration to
``reinvent'' and streamline government, the U.S. General Accounting
Office (GAO) issued a survey Monday that cited few signs of
measurable progress. The GAO, the investigating arm of Congress,
cited a growing number of ``high-risk'' agencies in a list that was
first drawn up in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Only one obscure operation, the Customs Service financial
management, was dropped from last year's list, and it was replaced
by the financial management of both the Federal Aviation
Administration and the Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, it appears that little progress has been made,
and Congress needs to know why,'' said Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn.,
chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., said it was ``frustrating that some
of the biggest problems GAO uncovered remain in place, years after
they were originally identified.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's review faulted Medicare for failing to safeguard its
$200 billion in annual outlays, at least $20 billion of which went
to pay medical bills that didn't comply with regulations in 1997.
The Defense Department was cited for sloppy records on its $250
billion in annual spending and for mishandling its huge stockpiles
of spare parts and surplus equipment.
</P>
<P>
   This year's review also focused on broader management concerns
throughout the government.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ Although food safety costs $1 billion a year, the effort is
inefficiently run because it's divided among a dozen federal
agencies. For example, if a plant makes pizza with meat toppings,
the Agriculture Department inspects it, but if a plant makes pizza
with vegetable toppings, the responsibility falls to the Department
of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   _ The government spends billions of dollars annually on
computerized information systems, and the return on the investment
has been ``disappointing _ in some cases nonexistent.'' In one case
a computerized program for Medicare soared to $1 billion before it
was canceled because it didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Housing and Urban Development Department, whose entire
operations have been listed as ``at risk'' since 1994, made plans
for drastic staff reductions, leaving it even more vulnerable to
fraud in its multibillion-dollar programs.
</P>
<P>
   _ The IRS claimed it was owed $214 billion from unpaid tax bills
as of 1997, enough money to cover all of Medicare outlays for one
year. However, accounting and collection procedures were so poor
that the IRS expected to collect only $28 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting office also reported that a federal mandate to
rehabilitate disabled people has not succeeded in putting many into
the work force. ``Despite the technological, medical and social
advances, not more than 1 in 500'' beneficiaries of disability
insurance left that program to take jobs, the GAO said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior aide to Vice President Al Gore, who has led a push to
``reinvent'' the federal government, said Monday, ``We can see
progress that potentially GAO is not able to see.'' He added that
the federal budget released next week would include new reforms to
combat waste.
</P>
<P>
   ``The so-called high-risk agencies have been a special concern
of both the vice president and Office of Management and Budget,''
the Gore spokesman said.

   NEW YORK _ Dizzy Gillespie may have died in 1993, but the great
jazz trumpeter and be-bop pioneer is far from forgotten. To keep
his genius and spirit alive, the Abrons Arts Center, at the Henry
Street Settlement on the Lower East Side, instituted the Dizzy
Gillespie Tribute Concert in 1995. At 8 p.m. Thursday, led by Paul
West, the center's music director and an alumnus of Gillespie's big
band and quintet, the fifth annual tribute is scheduled to be held.
Among those who are to take part are such jazz stars as the
trumpeter Jon Faddis, the saxophonist Jimmy Heath, the trombonist
Slide Hampton, the pianist Mike Longo, the bassist John Lee and the
drummer Winard Harper.

NO QUESTIONING `RENT'S' SPIRIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's hard not to like ``Rent,'' the Tony- and
Pulitzer Prize-winning musical now at the Shubert Theatre for a
six-week run.
</P>
<P>
   When Mimi (Daphne Rubin-Vega) bursts into would-be songwriter
Roger's loft and sings ``Out Tonight,'' a bolt of electricity
shoots through the audience. As Rubin-Vega provocatively prowls the
stage in high black boots and a shiny, tight-fitting black-and-blue
outfit and purrs, ``Get up, life's too quick. I know someplace sick
where this chick'll dance in the flames,'' it's hard not to be
riveted.
</P>
<P>
   That energy runs throughout ``Rent,'' which is a '90s version of
the Puccini opera ``La Boheme,'' about a group of impoverished
artists in the Latin Quarter of Paris in the late 19th century.
``Rent'' is set in New York City's East Village, and instead of
painters and writers, there are filmmakers and rock songwriters.
Instead of the scourge of tuberculosis, there's AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins on Christmas Eve. Mark (Trey Ellett), a young
filmmaker, has lost his girlfriend, a performance artist named
Maureen (Erin Keaney) to a woman, Joanne (Kamilah Jefferson), while
his roommate, Roger (Dean Balkwill), a songwriter and HIV-positive
ex-drug addict, has writer's block. To add to their woes, a former
roommate, Benny (Brian M. Love), has become their landlord and
demands the whole year's rent. He will forgo it, however, if the
pair persuade Maureen to quit protesting the clearing of a tent
city from a lot that Benny wants to develop into a new commercial
complex.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark and Roger already have decided not to pay the rent.
``We're not gonna pay last year's rent, this year's rent, next
year's rent! ... 'Cause everything is rent,'' they sing defiantly.
Their reasoning: ``How can you connect in an age where strangers,
landlords, lovers, your own blood cells betray.''
</P>
<P>
   Other characters are introduced. Another friend, computer wizard
Tom Collins (Mark Leroy Jackson), is mugged and helped by Angel
(Shaun Earl), a transvestite. They are attracted to one another,
and a bond develops when they both discover they are HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
   In the loft, Mark urges Roger to come to the protest, but Roger,
whose girlfriend had committed suicide, wants to be left alone and
dreams of writing one last song to ``redeem this empty life''
(``One Song Glory''). His solitude is interrupted by a stranger
from downstairs, Mimi, who needs a match because her electricity is
out. She and Roger are drawn to each other, but Roger realizes that
Mimi is an addict and rebuffs her. Only later, when they recognize
that both are HIV-positive do they become romantically involved.
</P>
<P>
   After the protest turns into a riot, Benny declares that the
Bohemian life is dead. But Mark and his friends are joyously
defiant in ``La Vie Boheme'': ``Anyone alive, with a sex drive,
tear down the wall,'' Mark sings. ``Aren't we all the opposite of
war? Isn't peace its creation?'' The celebration ends the first
act.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``La Boheme,'' the play's second act marches toward a
tragic ending, though ``Rent'' adds a twist. There is much to
applaud in this musical. There are some fun songs such as ``Tango:
Maureen,'' in which Mark and Joanne compare notes on his former and
her current lover, Maureen; and ``Take Me or Leave Me,'' which has
Maureen and Joanne working out their relationship. That ``Rent''
treats different forms of sexuality equally, that it deals with the
difficult questions of AIDS and the homeless is commendable. And
the message of ``Rent'' is about the spirit, the ability to
persevere in the face of death.
</P>
<P>
   Critics and audiences have cheered the musical. But _ and it's a
big one _ why? Is what we're seeing on the stage really insightful
or is it pandering to cheap anti-establishment sentiment?
</P>
<P>
   There isn't an easy answer, but much of what people think is up
isn't. First, Mark and Roger can't be considered serious artists.
They are dabblers who see themselves as different because they are
not part of the establishment. But it's really romantic dribble
masking their inability to be really committed artists. The works
they produce at the end are supposed to be a celebration and an
affirmation, but it hardly justifies their lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're living in America at the end of the millennium ...
where it's like the `Twilight Zone','' they sing. ``And when you're
living in America, at the end of the millennium, you're what you
own. So I own not a notion. I escape and ape content. I don't own
emotion _ I rent.''
</P>
<P>
   But they don't rent, they squat, and when Tom rewires an ATM
late in the play and gets a wad of cash, Mark and Roger joyfully
accept it. There is no mention of stealing nor are there any moral
qualms about taking it. The message is that society owes these
people because they, in their own eyes, are different _ artists.
And a moment like that should make the audience uncomfortable or at
least question the underpinnings of the play.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to understand the acclaim that ``Rent'' has gotten. It
is undoubtedly an interesting night of theater, and I wouldn't
discourage anyone from going.
</P>
<P>
   This production boasts a number of terrific performances. There
are some enjoyable songs, but the music itself is not particularly
noteworthy although it works well on stage. The musical's on-stage
energy is its main strength. But as drama, for which it won a
Pulitzer, ``Rent'' is no different than its operatic predecessor _
underwritten and somewhat disingenuous. &QL;

AT SEA, EXTRAS CAN ADD UP FAST  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 31) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla.)   (af)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As for the all-inclusive cruise: there is no such creature. No
matter how high up the caviar chain is a cruise line, with
Silversea and Seabourn probably at the top, there is always
something to be paid for at the end.
</P>
<P>
   A woman in the industry who took a seven-day Carnival cruise
with a companion for $2,300, air fare included, paid $450 for
extras. A reporter who took a $2,267 cruise of seven days on the
Grand Princess, air fare included, paid $208 in extras, among them
a $47.50 phone call, a $50 pedicure and $2.50 milkshake.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the number of extra costs is increasing is a matter for
debate. Readers have written that they believe more things aboard
are for sale. Charges for ice-cream sodas aside, passengers'
complaints often focus on pressure to buy: racks of cruise-logo
jackets and other clothing are placed in the lobby, one
letter-writer said; alcoholic beverages are offered at every turn,
another said, and spa employees embarrass passengers into buying
expensive products, according to still another.
</P>
<P>
   Two cruise-takers, Stanley and Arlene Harris of Brooklyn, spoke
unhappily of a ``bargain basement'' atmosphere aboard one cruise.
</P>
<P>
   Rick James, Princess Cruises' senior vice president for customer
services, was asked about the Haagen-Dazs milkshake bought aboard
the Grand Princess for $2.50 plus a 15 percent service charge.
James thinks that the changing taste of customers is creating more
of such extras aboard _ ``boutique items,'' he calls them. ``We
always have free ice cream in our dining rooms,'' James said, ``but
if people want Haagen-Dazs, that's a specialty item.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same thing if you go into a hosted bar ashore,'' he
said. ``If you want a standard drink, it's free, but if you call
for a brand, you will be paying something extra.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart T. Chiron, vice president of the Cruise Line, a
cruise-only agency in North Miami Beach, discussed whether on-board
shops and boutiques, whose wares have never been included in the
basic price, were flogging their merchandise too vigorously. ``The
gift shops must handle hordes of people,'' he said. ``So rather
than create a pile-up inside, they push racks outside. But it's not
intrusive.''
</P>
<P>
   Several people in the cruise business noted that shopping was a
major part of travel these days. Fran Wenograd Golden, the cruise
reporter for Travel Weekly, interviewed while aboard the Sea
Princess, said that every day, the ship newsletter carried ads for
things to buy. ``But people love it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a business that is increasingly competitive, the extras are
important to cruise companies. Bob Dickinson, president of Carnival
Cruise Lines, in his 1996 book ``Selling the Sea,'' said the cruise
lines added 10 percent to 20 percent to their bottom lines with
on-board activities, including shore expeditions. And what is the
biggest category on the list? Not the casino, Dickinson said in an
interview, estimating that only about 30 percent of passengers
visit casinos. Liquor and soft drinks, which cost extra on all but
a couple of lines, are the biggest revenue producers.
</P>
<P>
   In her new book ``The Complete Idiot's Travel Guide to Cruise
Vacations'' (Alpha Books-Macmillan, $16.95), Ms. Golden said that
typical prices were $1 for a soda and $2.95 and up for an alcoholic
drink. In the interview, she said that every ship had a daily
special cocktail, often a pina colada or other tropical choice, for
around $3, and that prices for premium brands or at martini bars
were much higher.
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson said that his company's ``sanity check'' on its prices
was to compare them with what was charged by on-shore resorts. ``On
our three- and four-day product,'' he said, ``we compare prices
with Disney and Universal Studios.''
</P>
<P>
   But cruise lines have a big added starter, Ms. Golden said, in
ship-to-shore calls, which can run $7 to $15 a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Other usual extra-cost items are baby-sitting; haircuts, facials
and massages; dry-cleaning and laundry, and photographs. A new one,
supporting James' contention that customer tastes are creating
change, is cappuccino. Carnival has now added espresso bars.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Aly Bello, a Carnival spokeswoman, sent along a menu for Cafe on
the Way, with espresso at $1.50, cappuccino at $1.95 and a
chocolate-covered strawberry at $1 (three for $2).
</P>
<P>
   Like Carnival, most cruise lines give the passenger a card that
enables extra expenditures, including gambling, to be charged to
the cabin. Charging gambling losses, like charging liquor, is a
process that worries organizations that treat addictions, but it is
markedly easier for the cruise ship to operate as a cashless
society. The reckoning comes on the last day, when the charges on
the card must be cleared, often on a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, Chiron of the Cruise Line said, the passenger gets a
leaflet on boarding that tells what is going to cost extra,
particularly the shore excursions. The Travel Co., the Cruise
Line's parent organization, has published ``Guide to Family
Cruising,'' a leaflet giving information on activities for 10 major
lines and sometimes, their baby-sitting fees. Fees for sitting,
where quoted, range from $8 an hour for two children in a family to
$10 an hour a child. To get the booklet, call (800) 777-0707 on a
touch-tone phone.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is standard: There is no standard set of charges in
any price category. Room service (from the regular dining room
fare) is always included. Caviar seldom is, but all Seabourn
cruises include it. Caviar is also free on the two Sea Goddesses,
owned by Cunard, and for grille-class passengers aboard the Queen
Elizabeth 2.
</P>
<P>
   Silversea advertises an all-inclusive price, including liquor,
tips, port charges, transfers, porter charges and economy air fare.
Dale DiBello, a spokeswoman, said that there was one free shore
excursion on particular cruises, a total of 27 out of 62 this
season.

   Haircuts and massages cost extra, as do dry-cleaning and
laundry, Ms. DiBello said. Photographs are free for previous

   Ernie Beyl of the Cunard division of Carnival said the prices on
Seabourn, another division, included ``stocking liquor in the

exception of very expensive brands. For instance? ``For example,
Johnnie Walker Blue, and an $800 brandy called La Tasche,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tips are covered. And that caviar, too. Some excursions are
covered, particularly those in Southeast Asia ``where there is no
place else to go,'' he said. ``But not ballooning over Stockholm,''
he added. Haircuts and massages must be paid for separately. There
is a charge for photos.

   Baby-sitting? Pause. ``This is not an ideal cruise for children,
although on occasion we have them,'' he said. ``Those parents must
make their own contacts with the staff members.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, dry-cleaning and laundry must be paid for, he said,
``although we have free laundries on board.''
</P>
<P>
   As a free activity aboard a cruise ship, watching the spin cycle
does not do it for me. Waiter, please bring strawberries. Bring
caviar. Bring the bill.

EX-ART DEALER CAUGHT IN FIASCO OVER ART STOLEN BY NAZIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL DOUGAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco art dealer Sydney Ashkenazie made
two unfortunate assumptions when he bought ``The Old Man with the
White Beard and the Black Cap'' from Christie's East auction house
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The first, despite Christie's own catalog claims: the elegant
portrait had been painted by Rembrandt.
</P>
<P>
   The second: the painting, which Ashkenazie bought for $27,000,
now belonged to him.
</P>
<P>
   Ashkenazie clings to his first belief, fervently insisting that
several experts _ who recently judged the painting to be the work
of a Rembrandt student or imitator rather than the master himself _
are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that the painting, now held in a secret
location by the U.S. Customs Service, is the property of
descendants of Adolphe Schloss, a Jewish commodities broker whose
333-piece art collection was on the top of Hitler's acquisition
list when Nazi troops rolled into France in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   Ashkenazie's predicament is not unique. As greater attention is
paid to European art looted by the Third Reich during World War II
_ mostly from Jews _ and as collectors who subsequently acquired
that art die off, more stolen works are cropping up in North
America.
</P>
<P>
   Ashkenazie, bankrupt after 22 years of selling Asian art and
jade from a lobby shop at the Fairmont Hotel, now lives with a
friend in Missouri. Though he has lost the painting, he still hopes
it might hold the key to a reversal of his personal misfortune.
</P>
<P>
   Ashkenazie, 62, figures that Christie's East _ the New York
branch of Christie's of London _ owes his bankruptcy estate upwards
of $20 million, his estimate of the painting's worth once it is
proved that Rembrandt did create it.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's officials, after denying any responsibility for
Ashkenazie's situation, have offered a $30,000 settlement to his
estate. Though he doesn't like it, there's little that Ashkenazie
can do. He said he could not afford a lawyer to press his case
before the bankruptcy judge. He plans to write the court a letter
pleading that the settlement be rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody who buys a house does a title search,'' noted
Constance Lowenthal, head of the New York-based World Jewish
Congress' Commission for Art Recovery. ``But when you're buying art
it's pretty hard to do that. The art world is finding out that they
need to make much more effort than they did in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a buyer, however innocently, acquires a stolen work of art,
he or she risks losing title if its history of ownership is
established, said Washington, D.C., lawyer Thomas Kline, who
represented Schloss heir Jean Demartini in his effort to get the
painting back from Ashkenazie.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Europe, a good-faith purchaser can acquire title,'' Kline
said. But in the United States ``a thief cannot pass title. We have
a very simple rule that you can't transfer to somebody else that
which you don't have.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashkenazie's painting can be traced back through several
previous owners. He obtained it from Christie's, which got the
painting from the estate of late Canadian collector Ian Woodner,
whose specialty was Rembrandt. Woodner paid $105,000 to buy the
picture from a Montreal man who obtained it in 1946 while stationed
in Munich.
</P>
<P>
   A Munich depot, as it happens, is the last known site of the
stolen Schloss collection, which disappeared into the hands of
looters in collapse of order at the end of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Though he doesn't regret it, Ashkenazie might have made one
final error: When he, unlike Christie's, determined that ``The Old
Man'' was part of the Schloss collection, he decided to locate the
owner's heirs and inform them of his find.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a duty as a human being to try to find them,'' he said.
It took him two years to identify Demartini as one of four legal
heirs to the Schloss estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are in bankruptcy and having problems, typically,
would (have sold) it privately to get what they could,'' he said.
``I didn't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he found himself under criminal investigation by
federal prosecutors in Manhattan after two meetings with people he
believed to be representatives of the Schloss family. They turned
out to be Customs Service agents conducting a sting operation.
</P>
<P>
   During the second meeting, Ashkenazie said, he suggested the
painting be sold and the proceeds divided evenly between his estate
and the Schloss descendants.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Customs Service in New York referred
questions regarding the case to the U.S. attorney. Shirah Neiman,
deputy U.S. attorney for the southern district of New York,
declined to comment on the case or say whether any investigation is
pending.
</P>
<P>
   No charges ever were filed, but the agents seized ``The Old
Man.'' Ashkenazie's bankruptcy judge ruled that it belongs to
Demartini and his relatives. Ashkenazie probably will not see it
again.

U.S. AND EUROPE REJECT COMPROMISE ON BANANA-TRADE POLICY
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Prospects for a quick end to the increasingly acerbic
trade row between the United States and the European Union over
bananas faded on Monday as a compromise was rejected and American
efforts to move ahead with sanctions were blocked, at least
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   After negotiations on Sunday, the two sides returned to the
table for hours, breaking away from a scheduled meeting of the
133-member World Trade Organization to consider a compromise, but
to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   The United States argues that the big American fruit
distributors Chiquita Brands International and the Dole Food Co.
are illegally restrained from selling Latin American-grown bananas
in Europe. Backed by Latin American countries, Washington won a WTO
panel ruling in 1997 that European import regulations favored
Caribbean nations, many of which were former European colonies. A
revised European banana trade policy went into effect on Jan. 1,
but the United States contends that it still violates international
trade rules.
</P>
<P>
   It says the European Union's failure to comply with the ruling
sets off retaliatory measures.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-nation European Union insists that its new regulations
meet the 1997 panel's requirements. Its trade negotiator, Roderick
Abbott, has called for a new panel to review compliance before any
sanctions are approved. U.S. trade officials are seeking immediate
approval for $520 million in sanctions against the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   A compromise, offered by Renato Ruggiero, the head of the World
Trade Organization, would have allowed the compliance-review panel
to also rule on whether the proposed American sanctions were fair.
Under trade organization rules, the sanctions must be equal to the
amount of trade that American companies have lost from
discriminatory banana imports.
</P>
<P>
   When they failed to compromise, the two sides squared off in
what was described as a ``bad-tempered discussion'' over the
American request for approval of its sanctions. Two Caribbean
banana-exporting countries, St. Lucia and Dominica, refused to go
along and blocked the adoption of the agenda where the sanctions
were to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, accused the
European Union of taking the ``extraordinary step of shutting down
the work'' of the trade organization to stave off punitive
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, we will have another opportunity tomorrow to see
if the E.U. will reconsider this drastic step and permit the WTO
meeting to proceed,'' Barshefsky said in a statement from
Washington. The blocked agenda will be the subject of a trade
organization meeting on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats fear that the dispute could escalate into a trade war
and jeopardize the organization. ``This dispute deteriorates the
whole WTO system,'' said Rita Hayes, the chief U.S. delegate. ``You
can't pick and choose the rules you wanted to abide by.''

IT'S ALL OVER BUT THE SHOUTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Christian Coalition Chairman Pat Robertson was
right when he said last week the Senate impeachment trial of
President Clinton is over and Clinton has won.
</P>
<P>
   This is the only time in several decades I have ever agreed with
Robertson on anything, and it's likely to be the last. But as
Robertson explained to horrified anti-Clinton folks whom he has
egged on since the president's 1992 election, ``All I did was state
the obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   Procedurally, Robertson was a tad premature. The fat lady has
yet to actually sing, the final gavel yet to fall.
</P>
<P>
   Realistically, however, he was simply saying out loud what
everyone already knows: The political demand for the president's
head never had public or bipartisan support and has not gained any
throughout this miserable impeachment charade.
</P>
<P>
   There is still plenty of opportunity in possible twists and
turns for the Senate to choose between adopting a timely,
face-saving exit strategy or dissolving into a repetitious,
partisan dogfight like that in the House. But whatever the course,
and however sharply partisan the final dividing lines, Clinton is
not going to be removed from office by the Senate just because the
House Republican majority wants him to be.
</P>
<P>
   It has been clear all along that the Senate GOP majority, even
if united, could not muster the 67 votes required to convict the
president without some Democratic defections. But to persuade
Democrats to kick out their elected party leader, it was necessary
to present a conclusive case that would convince the country his
sexual sins were so nation-threatening as to be impeachable.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee prosecutors, arguing in the Senate
for Clinton's conviction, failed to make that case. Their argument
was full of contradictory testimony, ambiguous details, conflicting
time lines, circumstantial evidence, prejudicial interpretations of
the president's unarticulated thinking, and arrogant dismissals of
exculpatory facts that clouded the ``big picture'' they were
portraying.
</P>
<P>
   Full of mildewed morality, they repeatedly dwelled on the
uncontested fact that Clinton is a lying lecher. Even the Democrats
_ especially the Democrats _ knew that already. But the prosecutors
could not make it sound as though this made him constitutionally
unfit to run the government, which he happens to be doing just fine
at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republicans compounded this farce by leaning on
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, one of the least-liked men in
America, to help them make an end run around the Senate for a
public relations stunt with Monica Lewinsky. This cozy teamwork
with Starr, the president's nemesis, offended many senators. They
are unaccustomed to being pushed around by members of what they
consider the ``lower body.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost as though the House wants to get the Senate into
the same kind of mistakes they made,'' observed Sen. Patrick Leahy,
(D-Vt.). The biggest fear of most sensible senators during this
whole proceeding has been that they might end up like milk gone
sour, as the House has.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, most things seemed to go the president's way last
week. His State of the Union speech was by all accounts a
blockbuster, reinforcing his national popularity and at least
temporarily diverting the dialogue from all-Monica to a serious
political agenda. Then he promptly appeared at overflow, open
rallies that demonstrated continuing public support.
</P>
<P>
   Next came retired Sen. Dale Bumpers, an Arkansas Democrat, who
made a personal pitch to his former Senate colleagues for his old
friend of a quarter decade. Bumpers was human, he was realistic, he
understood the political dynamics _ and he demonstrated that
eloquent oratorical skills were not after all a forgotten power.
</P>
<P>
   In any confrontation, there is a turning point, when it becomes
clear to all that continuing without a prompt decision would be
pointless or irretrievably damaging to all involved. We are very
close to that point now.
</P>
<P>
   Extending this charade to examine witnesses to please the House
prosecutors would serve no good purpose and would harm the Senate
as an institution as well as individual senators of both parties.
Republicans have nothing to gain by pursuing a lost cause in what
would increasingly look like a partisan vendetta. Democrats have
nothing to gain by further recitations of the president's sexual
sins.
</P>
<P>
   Voters have already put the Senate on notice they know the
country has nothing to gain. So get it over with, senators. Argue
about censoring him to your hearts' content, but reject the notion
of convicting him with as much dignity as you can still muster.
Your reputations are on the line, too.

   Mike Shanahan, the head coach, comes first. Then comes running
back Terrell Davis, quarterback John Elway and the Broncos'
underrated offensive line. The Broncos' defensive players know this
well. They understand where they rank.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not just because Shanahan is the mastermind, Davis
has 2,000 yards and Elway is Colorado's favorite resident. It's
because that defense has long been considered the weak link, a unit
not expected to be performing the way it has lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense has been awesome,'' Elway said. ``They've been
maligned, but when you look at it, they've given up six points in
the playoffs. They're playing good for us at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos have allowed 13 postseason points, but Elway is
discounting the 1-yard touchdown run by the New York Jets' Curtis
Martin in last week's AFC Championship Game. The Jets had secured
favorable field position by blocking a punt, not by driving against
the Broncos, and so Elway had a point in praising his teammates. In
fact, a yard is about all any team has been able to gain against
Denver on the ground lately.
</P>
<P>
   Since losing to Miami on Dec. 21, the Broncos have allowed just
88 yards rushing on 67 attempts (1.31 yards per carry) in their
last four games. Their points-allowed total also is impressive in
that only one other AFC team, the 1986 New England Patriots, has
been stingier in the divisional and championship rounds. The
Patriots gave up just nine points before the Chicago Bears
obliterated them in Super Bowl XX.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos aren't expected to meet a similar fate in their next
game, the Super Bowl against Atlanta next Sunday in Miami. They're
the favorites, both because they're defending their title and their
defense has suddenly elevated to a new level. The Falcons,
remember, have a Pro Bowl running back in Jamal Anderson and love
to force-feed him the ball at the rate of 25-30 carries per game.
Run defense is central to Denver's hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great teams can play rushing defense extremely well, and
that's what we've been able to do,'' Shanahan said. ``It's really
hard to win unless your defense dominates in the postseason. Over
the last couple weeks, we've been able to play extremely well on
defense and hopefully, we can do that a week from Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Denver's defense isn't underrated. Its players might
gripe about a lack of respect or being overlooked, but overall this
is a decent unit raising its game. Throughout the season, the
Broncos have been tough against the run (ranking third in the NFL
by allowing 80.4 yards rushing per game) and horrid against the
pass (26th in the league with an average of 228 yards per game).
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers are the result of one constant _ the explosiveness
of the Broncos' offense.
</P>
<P>
   Denver has routinely run away from teams, forcing them to pass.
A more accurate gauge of Denver's defensive flaws is the big-play
category. The Broncos' only two losses (to the New York Giants and
Miami) came on decisive touchdown passes against a secondary made
vulnerable by the heavy blitzing philosophy of defensive
coordinator Greg Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   But things are different now. The Dolphins, a poor offensive
team, managed only 14 yards rushing and lost, 38-3, in Denver's
opening playoff game. The Jets had one of the NFL's most balanced
offenses, and they also gained only 14 yards in Denver's 23-10 AFC
Championship Game victory. Denver's defense forced a combined nine
turnovers in those games, four off interceptions that had the
Broncos woofing in a I-told-you-so fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing bad they can say about our secondary now,''
said Broncos cornerback Darrien Gordon, who intercepted two passes
against the Jets. ``Vinny (Testaverde) threw for more than 300
yards, but they only scored 10 points.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought (the Jets game) was the best game that I've been
associated with since I've been in Denver, relative to the
defense,'' Shanahan said. ``I thought we played hard for 60
minutes. We made a bunch of plays. We had guys flying around. It
was really important to our defense to dominate that football game,
or at least give us the effort to dominate that game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos' defense didn't disappear in the postseason last
year, either. Though Elway and Davis were the heroes of last year's
Super Bowl, the Broncos still had to contend with Brett Favre and
Green Bay's offense in a two-minute situation. Denver clinched the
victory when linebacker John Mobley batted away a fourth-down pass,
not when Davis scored the go-ahead touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive players remember such moments fondly, just as they
do this season's.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look back to last year, that's how it was as well, with
us not getting much respect,'' said cornerback Ray Crockett. ``When
you have the type of offense we have, it's hard to get respect
because you're always blowing teams out. But when things get tough,
we take care of our business.''

 &HT;    GORE, BUSH MOVES UNDERLINE GROWING CLOUT OF HISPANIC VOTERS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hispanic leaders say they believe the Clinton
administration has finally gotten the message that Latinos, soon to
be the largest bloc of ethnic voters, want something more than
empty gestures from the nation's political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But with the exception of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the
Hispanic leaders wonder whether the Republican Party, which took
control of Congress in 1994 with sometimes harsh anti-immigrant
rhetoric, also recognizes how important Hispanic voters will be in
coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough to show up at Hispanic events, wear a
sombrero, eat a burrito and speak a few words in Spanish,'' said
Lisa Navarette, spokeswoman for the National Council of La Raza,
the largest Hispanic interest group. ``We just don't want to be
marketed to _ we want policy changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Navarette's comments in an interview Monday were prompted by
Vice President Al Gore, who, for the second time in two days,
outlined administration proposals aimed at the Hispanic community.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who plans to seek the Democratic Party's presidential
nomination next year, announced Monday that the administration will
request $1.3 billion over the next five years to restore
disability, health and nutrition benefits that legal immigrants
lost under the 1996 welfare reforms.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Gore announced that the federal government would
spend an additional $480 million next year on schools and
educational programs serving Hispanic students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the vice president has gotten the message,'' added
Navarette.
</P>
<P>
   These initiatives ``didn't just happen in a vacuum,'' said
Arturo Vargas, head of the National Association of Latino Elected
and Appointed Officials (NALEO) and chairman of the National
Hispanic Leadership Agenda, an umbrella organization for dozens of
Hispanic advocacy groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been pushing this administration for two years for these
initiatives,'' added Vargas. ``So, in many respects, (the Clinton
administration) is actually responding rather than initiating
something on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who met with Vargas and other Hispanic leaders last Friday
to put the final touches on the administration's initiatives, is
also responding to the changing demographics of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau projects that in 2009, Hispanics will surpass
African Americans as the largest ethnic group in the country.
Hispanics currently represent about 11 percent of the U.S.
population, just behind African Americans, who are 12.8 percent.
Significantly for electoral politics, they are concentrated in the
huge states of California, Texas, Florida and New York.
</P>
<P>
   The country's changing demographics have also gotten the belated
attention of the Republican Party, which until recently has shown
little empathy for immigrants. Much of the party followed the lead
of Pete Wilson, who, as governor of California from 1991 to 1999,
pushed hard for statewide initiatives to curb the rights of
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, who distanced himself from some of his party's harsher
stands, won nearly 50 percent of the Hispanic vote in his
re-election bid in Texas last year while the party was winning only
11 percent of Hispanics nationally, according to network exit
polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way we can cede the Latino vote to the Democrats
and win,'' said Mike Madrid, former political director of the
California Republican Party and now a top aide to Rod Pacheco, the
first Latino to head the Republican caucus in the California state
assembly. ``You cannot win anything in California without carrying
at least a third of the Hispanic vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who is widely regarded as the front-runner for the GOP
presidential nomination in 2000, has already contacted Pacheco to
discuss issues of importance to Hispanics. He is the only one in
the likely GOP presidential field who has, according to Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   But Dan Stein, executive director of the Federation for American
Immigration Reform, warned that any Republican back-pedaling on the
party's immigration reforms would be politically disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons the Republican Party took control of
Congress for the first time in 40 years was its commitment to
reform immigration and welfare,'' Stein said. ``Now, the president
wants to buy the immigrant vote for his vice president with
welfare. Can the Republican Party really go along with that?''

   Nature Conservancy Adds Tract in Maine &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At year's end, the Maine Nature Conservancy closed on its
largest land purchase, 286 square miles of forest along the state's
northwest border with Canada. The purchase of the two tracts from
the International Paper Co. is part of an effort to preserve the
wilderness and save rare plants.
</P>
<P>
   The tracts include 40 miles of the primeval Upper St. John River
reaching to the end of Baker Lake. The land has long been used for
hunting, fishing, camping and boating, and the recreational
activities will still be permitted.
</P>
<P>
   The conservancy may also allow some logging although the area
along the north-flowing river will remain untouched. But the
conservancy is not going into the park-management business; the
185,000-acre area will be managed much as it is now, by North Maine
Woods, an organization of regional landowners including paper
companies and the state.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bruce Kidman, a conservancy spokesman, the
organization will close many of the logging roads into the forests,
but will keep open and maintain the hauling roads across the areas.
North Maine Woods, a nonprofit organization, will continue to
collect entry and use fees for vehicles on these roads; the money
is used for repairs of boat ramps and other recreational
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The fees range from $5 a person for a night of camping to $60 a
season for day use plus unlimited camping. Kidman said that the
natural cycles of the area would prevent overuse because, for
example, May and early June are the months when the Upper St. John
has enough water for canoeing, and schools are not usually out
then.
</P>
<P>
   Mosquitoes and black flies are heavy in the usual Maine season:
Memorial Day to July 4. On the positive side, canoeists can paddle
for miles without seeing any development, sharing the river with
moose, osprey, great herons and other wildlife. The Furbish
lousewort, a wild snapdragon, is among the rare plants found in the
area.
</P>
<P>
   A brochure on the areas is available from North Maine Woods,
Post Office Box 425, Ashland, Maine 04732; (207) 435-6213. The Web
address is www.northmainewoods.org.

   Walking Tour Of Gay London Sites &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A new statue of Oscar Wilde is among the many sites on a new
walking tour devoted to gay London. The Soho district is the center
of gay London. The tour, run by a nonprofit London organization
called Kairos in Soho, offers a glimpse of the lives of gay men and
lesbians as well as an overview of the events that led to Britain's
partial decriminalization of homosexual acts in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   The statue of Oscar Wilde, by Maggi Hambling, is opposite
Charing Cross station and was unveiled Dec. 1. The author is
depicted in bronze rising from his marble sarcophagus, which
doubles as a bench. An inscription reads, ``We are all in the
gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of leading cultural figures, including Dame Judi Dench
and Sir Ian McKellen, helped raise money for the statue, which was
paid for by private and public contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour tour starts at 3 p.m. on Sundays, near Charing
Cross, outside St. Martin-in-the-Fields, a church on the northeast
side of Trafalgar Square. The tour shows the place where
homosexuals convicted in the ``Molly'' trials in the 17th and 18th
centuries (Molly being the word for homosexuals at the time) were
pilloried, with items such as bricks and glass or vermin and rotten
vegetables, at Charing Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the convicted were hanged. Those whose bodies were
unclaimed or not used for medical purposes were buried at the crypt
in St. Martin-in-the-Fields.
</P>
<P>
   Other points of interest on the tour are Kettner's and the Cafe
Royal, where Wilde used to dine with Lord Alfred Douglas, as well
as The Salisbury pub in St. Martin's Lane, a gay haunt and a locale
for a scene from the Dirk Bogarde movie ``Victim'' (1961), one of
the first films to examine the issue of homosexuality. Also on the
tour is the coffee bar As You Like It, where Quentin Crisp was a
regular.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The tour costs $8.25; reservations are not required. Call Kairos
in Soho: (44-171) 437 6063. &QL;

   Small-Print Alert For Frequent Fliers &QL;
</P>
<P>
   American, Continental, Northwest and US Airways have recently
changed their frequent-flier programs.
</P>
<P>
   A code-sharing agreement between Northwest and Air China allows
members of Northwest's frequent-flier program, Worldperks, to
acquire mileage and redeem awards on Air China flights to and from
North America. Air China has also joined frequent-flier agreements
with Alaska Airlines, America West and Continental. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The marketing alliance between Northwest and Continental now
allows Worldperks members to earn miles on all Continental flights,
and members of Continental's Onepass program can earn miles on all
Northwest flights, including its code-share flights with KLM.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, because Onepass mileage does not expire, miles in
the Worldperks program will no longer expire. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A change in the alliance between US Airways and American
Airlines permits members of American's AAdvantage program and US
Airways' Dividend Miles to combine miles from their accounts to
claim travel awards on US Airways, American Airlines or a
combination of the two. At least 1,000 miles must be used from each
account. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   US Airways has formed a partnership with Austrian Airlines.
Members of the Dividend Miles program may now earn miles or redeem
awards on any Austrian Airlines flight. The old partnerships with
Sabena and Swissair have been enhanced to allow members to earn or
redeem miles on any flight. &QL;

   3 Exhibits Focus on Black History &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New England will celebrate Black History Month, beginning
Monday, with exhibitions focusing on African-American leaders and
artists, including Frederick Douglass and the sculptor and
printmaker Elizabeth Catlett.
</P>
<P>
   Two exhibits at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford feature
selections from the Amistad Foundation Collection, housed in the
museum. ``Frederick Douglass in Black and White'' includes prints,
broadsides and portraits of the 19th-century orator and
abolitionist.
</P>
<P>
   The transport of African slaves to the Western Hemisphere,
especially the West Indies, is illustrated with maps, prints and
charts from the 17th to 19th century in ``Mapping the Caribbean:
The Atlantic Slave Trade.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wadsworth Atheneum, 600 Main Street, (860) 278-2670, is open
Tuesday to Sunday. Admission is $7, $5 for college students and
adults 65 and older and $3 ages 6 to 17. Children under 6 are
admitted free. For more information about Black History Month in
Connecticut, call the state's tourism office at (800) 282-6863.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Afro American History in Boston is mounting a new
exhibit of works by the contemporary photographer Don West,
``Portraits of Purpose II: Citizens Who've Made a Difference,'' in
the gallery of the African Meeting House on Beacon Hill. On display
through March, the photographs show community leaders who lived in
or passed through Boston, such as Stokely Carmichael and Dick
Gregory.
</P>
<P>
   The African Meeting House, 8 Smith Court, (617) 739-1200, is
open Monday to Friday. No admission charge; suggested donation is
$5, $3 for students and adults 65 and older. For more information

</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth Catlett, Works on Paper, 1944-1990'' is on display
at the Rhode Island Black Heritage Society in Providence through
March 1. Known primarily as a sculptor, Ms. Catlett, who grew up in
Washington, D.C., and was influenced by the Harlem Renaissance and
the social realism of the 1940s, moved to Mexico City and joined a
printmaking collective.
</P>
<P>
   Women and social justice are Ms. Catlett's principal subjects,
rendered in stylized forms. This exhibit, from the collection of W.
Watson Hines III, is based on her work as a printmaker.
</P>
<P>
   The Rhode Island Black Heritage Society, 202 Washington Street,
Providence, (401) 751-3490, is open Monday to Friday; Saturday by

SPREWELL WILL HAVE TO LIVE OFF EWING'S LEFTOVERS IN N.Y. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JORGE L. ORTIZ  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Every big scorer who lands in New York undergoes
the same difficult, sometimes humiliating transformation.
</P>
<P>
   They come in with gaudy numbers and suddenly watch their scoring
averages drop from the 20s to the mid-to-low teens, from the realm
of the stars to the realm of Johnny Newman.
</P>
<P>
   What happens to them? They get Patricked.
</P>
<P>
   Center Patrick Ewing has led the Knicks in scoring for 11
straight years, taking advantage of an offense that runs first and
foremost through him. Everybody else has to subordinate his game,
as Larry Johnson and Allan Houston have found out in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's Latrell Sprewell's turn.
</P>
<P>
   While Sprewell's off-court behavior will be under constant
scrutiny during his stint in New York, his play on the floor will
be what determines whether he wins the affection of the Knicks
fans, who will probably embrace him if he performs well.
</P>
<P>
   That may require Sprewell to accept a lesser role in the
offense, a difficult task for a player used to taking shots at
will. Sprewell led the Golden State Warriors in scoring and shot
attempts in each of his last four full years, and was on the same
pace until he attacked coach P.J. Carlesimo 14 games into the
1997-98 season. He hasn't played since.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when he averaged a career-high 24.2 points a
game, Sprewell finished eighth in the league in field goal tries,
often infuriating teammates like Chris Mullin and Mark Price by
refusing to share the ball.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of attitude will not go over well in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy's very talented and he's going to bring a lot to that
team _ if they can find a way for everyone to play together at the
same time,'' said the Warriors' new forward Chris Mills, who spent
last season with the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he can jell with those guys and try maybe not to do too
much at the beginning, I think he's going to do well. But I think
it can be a disruption if he comes out there and shoots his 25
times a night.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also the matter of Sprewell's position _ shooting guard,
the same one Houston plays _ and his penchant for slashing to the
basket, where he's likely to run into Ewing. Even at 36 and
out-of-shape, Ewing's not about to give up his post position for
anybody, let alone a newcomer carrying all that baggage.
</P>
<P>
   To be successful, Sprewell will need to walk a thin line between
deferring to his teammates and maintaining the fierce intensity
that makes him such a fine player. Perhaps he'll accept a secondary
role and will revert back to his days as a defensive demon who
forced turnovers and manufactured much of his offense off them.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, who adjusted his game to Ewing's in their first season
together then became more assertive last year during the center's
injury absence, doesn't foresee any difficulties incorporating
Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   He said they were ``very, very similar, but I don't suspect
that'll be a huge problem. I shouldn't be hurt any more than
Patrick and Larry (Johnson) should be hurt. We're all scorers. I
think the key is going to be finding a way to work together.''

 &HT;    TOP MICROSOFT EXECUTIVE DISPUTES GOVERNMENT ANTITRUST CHARGES
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington queues
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Radically opposing views of Microsoft's business
conduct emerged Monday as the highest-ranking Microsoft official
who will be called to testify in the company's antitrust trial
faced sharp questioning from the government's lead lawyer in the
landmark case.
</P>
<P>
   As the witness, Paul Maritz, saw it, Microsoft Corp. was in dire
peril in 1997 of falling victim to ``patent terrorism'' at the
hands of Apple Computer Inc., a company facing a change of bosses
while its marketing prospects were failing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our overwhelming objective was to get a cross-patent licensing
agreement with them,'' Maritz, Microsoft's group vice president for
platforms and applications, testified. ``A company going out of
business has only one kind of leverage left,'' he added, ``and in
such a situation, our own patents would have been worthless.''
</P>
<P>
   But to David Boies, one of the nation's leading trial litigators
and Maritz' nemesis in court, Microsoft's patent problems in
reality constituted only a minor sideshow, compared with the
software giant's overwhelming resolve to win a fight-to-the-finish
browser war with Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   As U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson intensely
studied his computer screen, Boies displayed a series of e-mails to
Maritz from Microsoft chairman Bill Gates. They stressed Gates'
goal of having Apple drop Netscape and adopt Microsoft's Internet
Explorer as the default browser for the Macintosh operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The messages seemed to contradict Maritz' direct testimony that
``Apple's distribution of Internet Explorer was not an important
part of the discussions'' between the two firms, which led to the
signing of a comprehensive deal with Apple in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Maritz quoted Gregory Maffei, now Microsoft's chief financial
officer, as ``distinctly (recalling) that he raised the subject of
Internet Explorer'' with Steven Jobs, who had just taken the helm
at a troubled Apple, ``while standing under a tree in Palo Alto on
July 20 (1997) only after they had already settled the broad terms
of the patent license and Microsoft's commitment to (continue to
produce) Mac Office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did Mr. Maffei tell you anything else about those
negotiations?'' Boies asked Maritz, who has been chosen by
Microsoft to serve as a ``summary witness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, he said Mr. Jobs was wearing no shoes,'' the bearded
Maritz replied in his clipped South African accent.
</P>
<P>
   He maintained that Microsoft was motivated to reach an August
1997 agreement with Apple out of fear of a patent ``lawsuit that
literally could have put us out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   To buttress his point, Maritz produced a four-point internal
negotiating memo on the Apple deal from Maffei to Gates, dated July
21, 1997, that didn't mention browsers. It did, however, refer in
passing, to Microsoft's willingness ``to fight a patent suit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't Microsoft produce this memo for the government
during the discovery phase of the trial?'' Boies demanded to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Maritz replied.
</P>
<P>
   But Maritz claimed to know the deep threat that losing the
browser battle would pose to his company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netscape was becoming a platform that other software could
depend on'' to run and be used, he said. ``If software is depending
on your competitor's platform...the value of (Microsoft's) platform
can become diminished.''
</P>
<P>
   Maritz' goal is to demolish the government's case by
withstanding Boies' line of attack during what promises to be a
lengthy cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   Back at Microsoft's Redmond, Wash., campus, Maritz, 43, oversees
the making and marketing of Microsoft's Windows operating systems _
an activity, he told the court, that earned the software giant
about $3 billion in revenues last year.
</P>
<P>
   He also is responsible for Microsoft's Office productivity
suite, which includes Word, Excel and Powerpoint, and its browsing
software, which the company elected to integrate into Windows,
thereby triggering the government's antitrust action.
</P>
<P>
   Public filings show Maritz' holdings in Microsoft to be worth in
excess of $300 million.

BRUINS FACE EASTERN CONFERENCE CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Less than half the season remains, with Game No. 44 on
tap in New York against the Islanders Tuesday night, so what can we
expect from the Bruins over the final 39?
</P>
<P>
   At the All-Star break, the Bruins were actually 1 point ahead of
last year's pace, though the marathon to the postseason may be more
gruelling in the competitive Eastern Conference this time. Toronto,
the new addition to the East, has shown gigantic improvement,
Ottawa has plenty of talent and has added experience based on last
year's postseason, Buffalo still has goalie Dominik Hasek, which is
enough, and Philadelphia has shored up its goaltending by acquiring
John Vanbiesbrouck. In addition, New Jersey is a perennial threat
and Pittsburgh has Jaromir Jagr.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily (or so it seems) for the Bruins, their destiny is in
their hands. If they take care of their own business, they should
be included in the postseason dance.
</P>
<P>
   For that to happen, some things have to change. The club lost a
3-1 decision to Ottawa last Thursday, and something about the mood
in the dressing room was troubling. The way the club played was
bleak, but the postgame demeanor was bleaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big game for us and we fell short,'' said Ray
Bourque. ``(The Senators) stick to their game plan and they bring
the type of game that we were bringing out a lot last year that we
haven't been able to get there this year. We know that at times we
stick to our game plan and play well and it works out for us. When
we get away from it, we get stung.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, something has been off. Khristich is having a
superior season, but his linemates, Sergei Samsonov and Jason
Allison, both must do better, especially Allison. That line is
being checked significantly closer than it was last season, when it
was largely an unknown quantity. Other teams target that line, and
when it isn't going, the Bruins are behind the 8-ball.
</P>
<P>
   The club hasn't had a definitive second line this season because
of injuries and also because whatever combination Pat Burns puts
together hasn't clicked.
</P>
<P>
   The third line of P.J. Axelsson, Tim Taylor, and Rob DiMaio
hasn't been together enough to fairly evaluate. They were the most
reliable trio last season, always putting pressure on the
opponent's top line, so Burns is crossing his fingers often, hoping
it stays healthy down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries have hit the team hard on defense, with veterans Dave
Ellett and Grant Ledyard out for long stretches. Bourque was out
for one game, against Toronto, and the result was a disaster. Now,
Kyle McLaren is out with a shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all that, the Bruins' biggest obstacle has been
inconsistency. Whereas last year the players seemed to be all on
the same page, this year that hasn't always been the case. Too
often the team has been fractured by some players trying to do too
much, others not doing enough, and still others not sure what to do
at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to recognize that we haven't really stuck to the game
plan,'' said Bourque. ``We've got a lot of guys, the same guys,
every night kind of sticking to it but we've got the odd guy kind
of getting away from it a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to win, we've got to have everybody on the same page.
The second half is going to be a grind all the way. We have to
recognize that we're going to have to be solid and focus on the
simple things, the basics.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ledyard and Chris Taylor both made the trip to New York, and one
or both could return to the lineup Tuesday night. Ledyard has been
out since Dec. 21 when he suffered a knee injury against Tampa Bay.
Taylor has been sidelined because of a shoulder separation suffered
during a practice in Nashville Dec. 29. Defenseman Terry Virtue,
who was sent back to Providence during the break, was recalled for
Tuesday night.

MASSCAP PURSE DOUBLED TO $600,000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In keeping with its position as part of the ``NTRA
Champions on Fox'' series, Suffolk Downs announced Monday that it
is doubling the base purse of the Massachusetts Handicap to
$600,000, with $400,000 going to the winner. The 60th MassCap,
elevated to a Grade II event, will be May 29, one of 11 races in
the lucrative series for handicap horses, which begins Saturday
with the $500,000 Donn Handicap at Gulfstream.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the purse of the Suffolk Downs Breeders' Cup
Handicap has been elevated from $200,000 to $250,000, and the
6-furlong event has been renamed for the late James B. Moseley, the
former chairman of Suffolk who died last spring. A $100,000 MassCap
Day grass race for fillies and mares that had been named for
Moseley will return to its original name, the Drumtop, in honor of
an outstandinmg turf mare once owned by Moseley.
</P>
<P>
   The MassCap, which was run from 1935-89, then reinstated by
current management in 1995, has gained stature over the last
several years, as two-time Horse of the Year Cigar won twice, and
then presumptive Horse of the Year Skip Away repeated the feat.
Cigar and Skip Away both were lured to the East Boston oval by
creative bonus offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an effort to maintain the position of the MassCap as one of
the nation's premier handicap races, and in conjunction with our
role in the NTRA championship series, we thought it would be
prudent to raise the purse,'' said Suffolk executive vice president
Lou Raffetto. ``The guaranteed winner's value of $400,000 is also
one of the largest top shares for any handicap in the country. Our
goal is to ensure the participation of the national division
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for renaming the sprint race in honor of Mr. Moseley, it
was always the late chairman's dream to have Suffolk Downs host a
showcase day of racing for the Boston fans. This continues to build
on our Million Dollar Day theme of the past several seasons.''

</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENIFER HANRAHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ She's 32, blond and earns a healthy income as a
marketing executive. He's a stockbroker with a six-figure income,
tall and handsome.
</P>
<P>
   They're both single _ and tired of waiting for fate to
intervene.
</P>
<P>
   So each sought professional help, not on a therapist's couch,
but at Just Eight Inc. For $2,500 a piece, they signed up for 12
dinners in upscale Los Angeles restaurants at a table set for eight
_ four single women and four single men.
</P>
<P>
   The dating service, run by Nancy Jordan and Samantha Martin, is
designed to be less threatening than one-on-one meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to make this as close to having dinner parties in
our own home as possible, a meeting of friends, rather than a cold
and clinical procedure,'' said Jordan, 51, who marketed toys before
starting the business last year.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first video-dating service was launched 25 years ago,
the business of matchmaking has morphed into many forms. Some
services, like Just Eight, try to emulate real-life social
situations, attempting to make clients feel less emotionally
exposed by camouflaging the quest for the ideal mate through
orchestrated gatherings of strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Others tout convenience _ they'll prescreen blind dates for you
and even arrange the meeting time and place. Still others promote
exclusivity _ anyone who can pay the steep price to join has to
have some money in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go to the bar, it's hit or miss,'' said Robert Bryson,
30, a Just Eight member. ``With this, you know somebody has got
their act together enough and is serious about it enough to pay the
money.''
</P>
<P>
   As the dating industry has expanded, so have the choices.
</P>
<P>
   Want to see the goods before going on the date? You can peruse
personal profiles at Great Expectations, the granddaddy of
video-dating services. Would you rather spend every Saturday night
for the rest of your life with your cat than tell a video camera
your idea of a romantic evening? There are plenty of other options.
You can go on lunch dates, to singles parties, gourmet cooking
classes for singles or kayaking for singles.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of matchmaking sites operate on the Internet. One company
is promoting a matchmaking kit via infomercial. For only $39.99 a
month, a computer program will spit out potential suitors in your
area, based on your responses to a questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean the days are gone when church socials or your
meddling mother are the ones helping you find true love? Not
necessarily. But it does mean singles feeling alone in a world of
twosomes can get some serious, if pricey, assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Dating just isn't what it used to be. Sure, the first meetings
are still awkward, the pressure to impress can make your palms
clammy and, at the end of the night, you're wondering if it was all
worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Only now you're talking about investing in more than a new
outfit or picking up the tab. You could be forking over several
thousand dollars for the privilege of meeting the willing and
available.
</P>
<P>
   A one-year membership with It's Just Lunch! includes 16
Dutch-treat dates for $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   From a single office in Chicago, It's Just Lunch! has grown to
30 branches around the country, with a membership of 20,000. In the
Los Angeles/Orange County area, there are about 1,500 members,
mostly in their late 20s to mid-30s, said Nancy Kirsch, senior vice
president of the 7-year-old company.
</P>
<P>
   ``People's stereotype of dating services and matchmakers is, `If
I go to one of those places, I might as well walk in with a big `L'
on my head. It is so !ital!not !off!like that ... At least in our
service it's not,'' Kirsch said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all members of It's Just Lunch! have bachelor's degrees.
About 70 percent have graduate degrees. The average yearly income
of clients is more than $85,000; for women, it's more than $55,000.
Those figures are significantly higher in major metropolitan areas
such as Los Angeles and New York, Kirsch said.
</P>
<P>
   Shoshana Botnick, 37, a Century City corporate real estate
lawyer, signed up for It's Just Lunch! in July after a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   At first, dates arranged by the Los Angeles office were
sporadic. But lately, she's had plenty of set-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Only one date, she says, was with a ``loser'' who showed up
wearing a Donald Duck tie and told her about his trip to Russia to
meet women interested in marrying American men.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, she's met accountants, lawyers, investment bankers
and men who own their own companies. Of eight dates, six asked her
out again. She dated one for several months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely enjoying this whole thing,'' Botnick said. ``It
puts less pressure on me because I feel somebody is taking care of
me, somebody is working for me.''
</P>
<P>
   If morals matter more than money, try religious matchmaking.
It's come a long way since the days of sipping punch during mixers
in church basements.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Reneau started Catholic Singles Network eight years ago.
Sight unseen, men and women are matched by Reneau and asked to get
together for a meal or Mass. He requests that his clients don't
turn down the date based on the initial phone conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had people coming to me from Great Expectations who said,
`I selected 20 videos last year and the other person refused the
date,''' Reneau said. ``When you're single, rejection is the last
thing you need. Your self-esteem takes a beating.''
</P>
<P>
   Reneau keeps fees low _ $150 a year for monthly set-ups _ so
hardly anyone is excluded because they can't afford it. Above all,
he looks for clients ``who are considerate of others and will go
out of their way to be kind and respectful.''
</P>
<P>
   The group also has semi-monthly ``rotational dinner parties''
where about 100 men and women are seated according to age and
interests. Three men and three women sit at each table; dining
partners change after each of four courses, allowing for people to
meet lots of singles, Reneau said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a not a stuffy, nerdy type of occasion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew and Sara Lee, both 28, of Pasadena met on Sara's 11th and
Andrew's first date. Andrew, a computer network engineer, showed up
driving exactly the same kind of car as hers. He played her
favorite band on his radio and brought her mauve roses, her
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   They are now married with a 5-month-old son, Joshua.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I would join a dating service,'' Sara said.
``I was afraid ... I'm not the most outgoing person. But I'm so
happy I did because I don't think we would have met each other
otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Jewish singles have a similar option. They can meet through a
new service called Lunch First, started by Bill White three months
ago. For $1,000 a year, he'll arrange 14 introductions. Members
will also host cocktail parties in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do people meet members of the opposite sex, they meet
friends,'' White says. ``I look at the whole thing as a place to
network.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no mystery why so many people are trying to cash in on
the dating game. The Houston-based Great Expectations has
successfully given singles an alternative to blind-date horror
stories for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 165,000 members nationwide paying $1,500 a year,
the company boasts more than five marriages a day among couples who
met through the service, says CEO D. James Durante.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are busy and they really don't have a lot of
opportunities to meet enough people to make a lot of good, solid
choices,'' Durante said.
</P>
<P>
   Men and women alike are getting choosier, Durante said. Decades
ago, women in particular felt pressure to marry to fulfill an
expected societal role, but nowadays, many feel that waiting for
Mr. Right is perfectly acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``People now realize marriage should be a true partnership that
has a lot of compatability, not just chemistry,'' James said.
</P>
<P>
   But are any of these dating services worth the money? That
depends on what you're looking for, clients say.
</P>
<P>
   Joining a dating service is no protection against the Saturday
night strikeout. You can go to a Just Eight dinner party and watch
the person you have your eye on engrossed in conversation with
someone else. You can open up to a video camera, only to have your
deep thoughts tossed aside like the movie stub from a lousy date.
</P>
<P>
   Dating services can work for people who want to ensure they come
face to face with a steady stream of singles. But you're bound for
disappointment if you expect to find an instant spouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just necessarily put two people together on paper''
and conjure true love, Botnick said. ``But it's fun to get jazzed
up for a date and have somebody find you attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   To Natalie, the marketing exec who sign up for Just Eight, the
arranged dinners are something like being at the liveliest table at
a friend's wedding, a seating arrangement that almost never
happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a one-on-one date, you feel like you have to give a
performance,'' said Natalie, who asked that her last name not be
used because of the stigma still attached to dating services. ``In
a group, if you want to hang back and be quiet and find out what
everyone else is about, you can and no one cares.''
</P>
<P>
   In three dinner parties, Natalie hasn't found anyone to date.
But, with the same eternal optimism that most singles adopt to get
themselves out of the house on weekends, she has expanded her
social circle in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a stockbroker out of it and a golf instructor out of
it,'' she said. ``It has contributed positive things to my social
life and to my business life. Besides, you never know who my
stockbroker might fix me up with.'' &QL;

LUXURY IN THE SKY FOR THE HIGH-FLIERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Imagine that you could buy your own jet airplane _ not
a little jet airplane, but a big jet airplane, just for you.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a cramped seat that tilts back only part way, you
could put in a whole bedroom, just for you. On those long flights
over the Pacific, you could slip under the covers, shut the door,
and really go to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of freshening up with hot towels, you could freshen up
with a hot shower _ in your own bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   These are the kind of choices open to people who can spend $38
million to $45 million on a top-of-the-line, long-distance business
jet.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a big market. But it's bigger than it used to be, and
it grows every decade. In the 1990s, the emergence of a time-share
market in jet aircraft has increased it substantially. A few years
ago, the large corporate jet market had essentially one company:
Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. of Savannah, Ga. It now has four
companies with similar-priced offerings: Gulfstream, Bombardier,
Airbus and Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   For Seattle, the rivalry between these four has a special
relevance. Boeing, which butters its bread by pleasing airlines,
faces a wholly different kind of customer with different priorities
and a different menu of airplanes to choose from. Boeing has chosen
to pursue these customers in a different way _ different from
Airbus, and different from itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing Co. got into this market because of a dinner between
Chairman Phil Condit and a frustrated customer. The customer was
Jack Welch, chief executive of General Electric Corp. Welch had
gotten tired of flying long distances in cramped jets, and had
bought a couple of Boeing 737-600s.
</P>
<P>
   He liked them fine except for one aggravation: They didn't go
far enough. Their range was 3,000 miles _ OK for some airlines, but
not for Jack Welch.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's Borge Boeskov, who tells the story, came up with a
hybrid product: a 737-700 body with 737-800 wing, engines and
landing gear, and with extra fuel tanks. It's the Boeing Business
Jet _ the BBJ _ a program run by Boeskov, a longtime Boeing man who
had worked on Air Force One. General Electric came in as a minority
partner, and the plane has General Electric engines on it.
</P>
<P>
   Who buys such a jet? Mostly it's customers who don't want their
names in the newspaper. They come in three groups. The first is
Fortune 100 corporations like GE. These are half the market, and in
the long run probably more than half. The second, 20 percent of the
market, is countries the size of Poland or Mexico, who don't want
to pay $250 million for a Boeing 747 but need an ``Air Force One''
that can move their president with dignity and security, and
without having to refuel in some politically inconvenient country.
</P>
<P>
   The final group is the seriously rich, the Paul Allens and Greg
Normans of the world. ``They may have a board of directors,''
Boeskov says, ``but they don't ask them about anything. They do
what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Selling to these buyers is far different from selling to an
airline. The airline sees only an economic machine. It studies
costs down to the penny. Corporate buyers consider costs, but look
more at the mission. All the buyers in this market are presumed to
have planes already, and people to maintain and fly them. Boeing
advertises the BBJ not in publications for rich people, like the
Robb Report, but in publications like Professional Pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Individual buyers read up on the jet and listen to what their
pilots say, but in the end they make a personal decision. ``There's
an incredible amount of peer pressure,'' particularly among
entrepreneurs, to have the newest and neatest machine, says the
BBJ's top salesman, Lee Monsen.
</P>
<P>
   Monsen says you can't always tell who these rich people are.
When he was selling planes for Gulfstream, a man about 35 wearing
jeans, gold chains and a ponytail came in, looked briefly at a jet,
and wrote out a personal check for $11 million. Monsen was
doubtful, and he checked with the bank.
</P>
<P>
   No, there weren't funds in the account. Yes, the bank would
cover it. Ponytail was an heir to a fortune in uranium mining.
</P>
<P>
   In the corporate jet business, says Monsen, if a prospect says
he's rich, assume he is. ``You kiss a few frogs,'' he says, ``and
some of them turn into princes.''
</P>
<P>
   In entering this market, Boeing and Airbus have a huge advantage
over Gulfstream and Bombardier: The 737 and the A-319 were
developed for the commercial market. Boeing is rolling out its
new-generation 737s at 24 per month. It has huge economies of
scale. It would be like General Motors developing an RV version of
its buses and putting it up against Winnebago.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing and Airbus thus cost only a bit more than the Gulfstream
and Bombardier planes, but are three times as roomy inside. They
make the most of it. One Boeing sales presentation is to take
prospective customers through a Gulfstream-Bombardier fuselage, and
then through a fuselage of the BBJ, and ask: ``In which would you
rather spend a 14-hour flight?''
</P>
<P>
   The two smaller rivals don't take this sitting down. William
Boisture, president and chief executive of Gulfstream says, ``The
BBJ wins on one parameter, and that's size.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gulfstream 5, produced by a publicly traded company with
7,000 employees, is the culmination of a family of jets that have
long been considered the Rolls-Royce of the air. The G-5 is sleeker
than the BBJ, and burns fuel at about half the rate. It flies
higher and can go a few hundred miles farther, and because it's
half the weight, it can take off and land on smaller runways.
</P>
<P>
   Boisture says the G-5 can use 85 percent of the world airports
in the Boeing Airport Database. ``The BBJ can use less than 25
percent of the airports in that database,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   To some users, that makes the difference. When golf pro Greg
Norman ordered a BBJ, Boeing put him in ads. Norman was designing
golf courses all over East Asia and wanted a BBJ for those 14-hour
flights across the Pacific. But the Asian market dried up, and
Norman's business switched to rural areas in North America served
by tiny airports. The BBJ can't get into Aspen, Colo., and Sun
Valley, Idaho. In November, Norman canceled his BBJ order.
</P>
<P>
   Two other rivals are on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus Industrie, based in Tolouse, France, is familiar to those
who know Boeing. The A-319 Corporate Jet is similar to the BBJ. It
is slightly roomier, being 7 inches wider at the floor. It claims
slightly more range than the BBJ, which the BBJ plans to offset by
using winglets. The A-319 could conceivably counter with its own
winglets, but has not.
</P>
<P>
   The A-319 offers a special ``double bogey'' landing gear that
allows it to use more airports than the BBJ _ but the landing gear
adds weight.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial airliners tend to hold their value longer than
corporate jets. Airbus says it will have the best resale value
because the A-319 is an off-the-shelf model while the BBJ's
wings-and-fuselage combo makes it, in the words of Airbus
spokeswoman Mary Anne Greczyn, ``a mutt.''
</P>
<P>
   The BBJ's Monsen says he doubts that anyone would rip out the
custom-made, $6 million to $12 million interiors of either of these
jets to convert them to commercial airliners. But it could be done
on the BBJ as easily as the Airbus, he says. To an airline, the BBJ
would be ``a 737-700 with a few hundred extra pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   To Monsen, an important difference between Boeing and Airbus is
in the organization of sales and service. Boeing Business Jets has
its own office, at Boeing Field; unlike the rest of the company,
the 35 employees don't wear badges. Monsen sells nothing but BBJs.
(He's not paid on commission.) Airbus North America has two
salesmen who work the A-319, but they also sell cargo planes.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth contender is Bombardier Aerospace. Based in Montreal,
Canada, Bombardier (pronounced bom-BAR-dee-ay) has about one-fifth
the employee base of Boeing but seven times that of Gulfstream.
Bombardier, whose stock is traded on the Toronto exchange, has
47,000 employees, 19,000 of them in the United States. It owns
Learjet. Its Global Express is the direct rival of the Gulfstream
5.
</P>
<P>
   But while the G-5's design is an evolution of the G-4, the
Global Express was designed from scratch. ``Everyone else,
including Gulfstream, Boeing and Airbus, has taken an existing
airplane and tried to modify it for this mission,'' says Bombardier
spokesman Leo Knaapen. ``We spent the money and time to get it
right.''
</P>
<P>
   The pride of the Global Express is its wing, which has a
35-degree sweep-back similar to the wing on the smaller Cessna
Citation 10, the fastest corporate jet on the market. While Global
Express has the same engine as the G-5, the plane, though bigger
and heavier, cruises slightly faster (see chart). Also, its wing
has full leading-edge slats, which it says allows it to get in and
out of more airports than even the G-5 can.
</P>
<P>
   Gulfstream chief executive Boisture sniffs at all the high-tech
talk. ``We both beat the subject to death,'' he says. What counts
is what a plane can do. ``And when you're on an airport in
Kazakhstan, the fewer moving parts the better.''
</P>
<P>
   The test pilot for Aviation Week magazine, David North,
concluded in the Aug. 17, 1998, issue that the Global Express ``has
some advantages over the G-5,'' but predicts that the outcome in
the market will be based much on company loyalty, and ``will come
close to a tie.''
</P>
<P>
   Gulfstream was the first of the four in the market, and beat
Bombardier by two years. It had sold 106 G-5s by Sept. 30. The
customer for the 100th airplane was Microsoft's chief of research,
Nathan Myhrvold.
</P>
<P>
   Bombardier will deliver its first Global Express this spring,
and Knaapen says the company has more than 80 firm orders.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus expects to deliver its first A-319 corporate jet this
year, and perhaps one more. It has just 12 ``commitments,'' and
only some of those are firm orders.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, when it announced the BBJ, told the press it expected to
sell 10 planes a year. Internally, it planned for six. The company
had done no study _ unusual for Boeing, which studies everything.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing delivered eight BBJs in 1998. It plans to deliver 29 this
year and 25 next year. It has 46 firm orders.
</P>
<P>
   As to the future, Gulfstream foresees a market of 400 to 500
airplanes over the next 10 years, and expects to get half. ``We
have more than 50 percent of the market right now,'' says Boisture.
</P>
<P>
   Bombardier foresees a market of 500 to 800 planes over the next
15 to 20 years, and expects to get half of that.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing projects a market of 600 over the next 10 years, and
expects 40 percent _ 24 planes per year.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus foresees a submarket of about 24 per year of
Airbus-Boeing-sized planes _ 240 over 10 years _ and expects to get
half of that.
</P>
<P>
   Readers who have been doing their math will note that the
various competitors have laid claim to about 160 percent of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's the airplane business.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ ``I asked them to kill me now,''
Mohammed Sesay remembered pleading after he was caught by rebels
gripping machetes.
</P>
<P>
   But they ignored him. They held his arms flat on a tree stump.
And he felt the machete fall on a wrist, then on the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' the rebels told him, ``is an example to show the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Hacking off hands and feet of ordinary people has been a key
weapon of a widespread campaign of terror and butchery waged by
rebels in Sierra Leone trying to overthrow this ravaged country's
president. In recent days, the fighting has reached the capital,
marking another brutish turn in a civil war that has pushed Sierra
Leone to the brink of disintegration.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly seizing Freetown, only to be pushed back by
Nigerian-led forces last week, the rebels have retreated eastward
into the surrounding mountains brandishing the threat of a future
assault. As they fled, the rebels shot thousands of civilians dead
and mutilated hundreds of others.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, scores of men, women and children, with hands
chopped off or dangling limply from their forearms, have flooded
the main medical center, Connaught Hospital. A few days earlier,
the hospital had received so many wounded and dead that corpses
lying in the driveway had drawn dogs and vultures. By the weekend,
hospital officials had recorded 2,768 dead in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my lifetime this is the worst I have ever seen,'' said Dr.
Johnston Taylor, in the middle of surgery in a small, unlit
operating room, the smell of sweat- and blood-soaked clothes
clinging to the airless room.
</P>
<P>
   With Freetown under siege for two weeks, deserted by nearly all
international humanitarian organizations, Taylor was performing
surgery without anesthetic. His patient, a young man whose left leg
had been shattered by a bullet, punctuated the surgeon's words with
moans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last one was worst,'' the surgeon said, referring to the
fighting last February when Nigerian-led forces had expelled the
same rebels from Freetown. ``Now I don't know what adjective I
should use to describe what is happening now. I don't know whether
there is a better adjective to use than worst. It's unimaginable to
see what we are doing to ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day that a Nigerian soldier found Sesay slipping into
unconsciousness on a street and brought him to Connaught, surgeons
performed so many amputations that they tossed severed hands into a
communal bucket.
</P>
<P>
   As his brother Ishmael carried a spoonful of milk to his lips,
Sesay, 29, lay on his bed and recalled that he had fled his family
house in eastern Freetown after rebels calling themselves Sergeant
Burnhouse and Captain Blood burst inside and shot dead eight of his
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other victims, Sesay knew the killers; they lived in
his neighborhood, and he and his brothers had even considered them
friends. Like many other victims, he was also told that they would
keep him alive but turn him into a political message.
</P>
<P>
   Atop a mountain overlooking Freetown, inside a heavily guarded
compound, President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah had not descended yet into
the city to see the bandaged stumps on Sesay's arms or other
mutilated people, because of safety concerns, said his spokesman,
Septimus Kaikai. Kabbah was also unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is resting,'' Kaikai told journalists visiting
the compound.
</P>
<P>
   About the injured and the dead, Kaikai said: ``These are the
things that happen as a result of war. If you go to Vietnam, there
was a lot of carnage. If you go to Cambodia, there was a lot of
carnage.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In 1996, after years of civil war, Kabbah, a lawyer and a former
official of the U.N. Development Program, became this West African
country's first democratically elected president, before being
overthrown a year later by the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council
and the Revolutionary United Front.
</P>
<P>
   With virtually no national army, Kabbah relied on a West African
peacekeeping force known as Ecomog, led by Nigeria, to regain power
last March. Since then, the ousted rebels _ who are backed by
neighboring Liberia, according to Washington and other Western
governments _ have massacred villagers in eastern and northern
Sierra Leone, even as they prepared another assault on Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   Although mass killings have occurred elsewhere in Africa, the
rebels here have distinguished themselves by not killing their
victims, but by mutilating them and leaving them as living symbols
of terror. Rebel leaders have denied the mutilations, accusing the
Kamajors, an untrained, civilian defense force that includes many
boys and is supporting the president.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the New York-based Human Rights Watch released a
report concluding that the Kamajors had committed abuses but that
most of the atrocities up to then had been committed by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   At Connaught Hospital _ a dilapidated two-story structure built
in the 1920s by the British, the country's former colonial rulers,
and with 212 beds, Sierra Leone's biggest hospital _ the survivors
all accused the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   In Ward 2, Mohammed Sesay, a farmer who is not related to the
other Sesay and did not know his own age, stood with his 2-year
son, Osman, whose fractured head was bandaged like a bicycle
helmet. A couple of weeks earlier, rebels had invaded the family's
house outside Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   ``They caught his mama and chopped, chopped her,'' Sesay said.
``Then they threw him inside the toilet.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, long lines of refugees streamed into central
Freetown from the east. At Connaught Hospital, as guards kept the
main gates locked, the most seriously injured were brought inside,
past the main entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Just inside the gates, amid scores of injured waiting to be
treated, Danka Koromoh stood, indomitable, over three of her
daughters. Her 3-year-old was uninjured, but flies buzzed around
the bloodied bandaged stump where 14-year-old Mariama's left hand
used to be. Aissatou, 12, sat next to her mother's right leg, her
two hands severed.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Koromoh said the rebels had also sliced off the hands of
her 8-year-old daughter and had kidnapped the 13-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``They killed my sister and my husband,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A few feet away, Lamine Jusugarka, 46, the father of six, sat
slumped on the concrete ground, both hands gone. His niece, Isata
Bangura, 15, whose parents had been killed two days earlier, fed
him potato chips. His wife sat nearby, crying, her kneecaps smashed
by a hammer-wielding rebel.
</P>
<P>
   The day before, according to Jusugarka, a former security guard
at Barclays Bank, rebels had invaded his neighborhood east of
Freetown. Most were young men, or even boys, led by a rebel who
called himself Junior.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a young man I can handle and deal with'' under normal
circumstances, Jusugarka said.
</P>
<P>
   But the rebels, pointing guns, forced him and his neighbors
under a mango tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because there was a root on where you could put your hands
firmly,'' he recalled. ``Then he took a big ax and cut your hand
instantly. Tell you to put another one. You put it. Cut it. We were
50 in number.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I felt so bad,'' he said. ``I felt as if I am finishing
the world. My eyes were dark. My blood was pumping as if they had
opened a tank, a water tank to run. Oh, I fell down. I could not
see my way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in the line. One after another. You go next. When they
finished with you, when they cut your two hands, you run. They say,
`Move! If you don't move, we'll fire on you.' Fifty on that
particular day.''

ROBERT SHAW, 82; INNOVATIVE CHORAL COMPOSER FOR HALF-CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Shaw, the dominant figure in American choral music for
more than half a century, died Monday in New Haven, Conn.; he was
82 and had suffered a stroke. He was visiting Yale to see a
production of Samuel Beckett's ``Endgame,'' which his son Thomas
directed and acted in.
</P>
<P>
   With the founding of New York's Collegiate Chorale in 1941, Mr.
Shaw launched a career that changed the way American choruses
sounded _ and wanted to sound. In 1948 he founded the Robert Shaw
Chorale, which toured the world and recorded many central
masterpieces of the choral literature as well as best-selling
albums of Mr. Shaw's arrangements of folk songs, Christmas carols,
and spirituals. The Robert Shaw Chorale embarked on famous
collaborations with Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony (after
hearing his first Shaw rehearsal for the finale of Beethoven's
Ninth Symphony, Toscanini cried, ``It is the first time I hear it
sung!''). From 1956-67, Mr. Shaw was associate conductor of the
Cleveland Orchestra, developing one of America's greatest
orchestral choruses and building a partnership with George Szell
that rivaled his collaboration with Toscanini; in this period Mr.
Shaw was also able to explore conducting the orchestral literature.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967 he became music director of the Atlanta Symphony, a
position he held until 1988; he built the orchestra into an
institution of stature and made a long list of prize-winning
recordings there, while continuing to make guest appearances
elsewhere _ his only operatic conducting was for Sarah Caldwell's
production of Berlioz's ``The Damnation of Faust'' with the Opera
Company of Boston in 1978. In the last decade Mr. Shaw had
continued to appear regularly in Atlanta and elsewere, while
supervising annual choral institutes in France and in Carnegie
Hall. He had also become an annual guest of Boston University,
where the choral program is led by one of his protegees, Ann Howard
Jones; over the last few years Mr. Shaw had led memorable student
performances of Honegger's ``King David,'' Haydn's ``The
Creation,'' and the Brahms ``German Requiem''; he had been
scheduled to return next week.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Shaw served on the faculty at Tanglewood from 1942-45 and
returned 50 years later to resume an association with the Boston
Symphony Orchestra that resulted in notable performances of the
Mozart ``Requiem,'' Stravinsky's ``Symphony of Psalms,'' and
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. On opening night of the current season
last September, Mr. Shaw flew in to replace Seiji Ozawa at the gala
concert celebrating Ozawa's 25 seasons as music director; with
utter professional aplomb, Mr. Shaw led Beethoven's Ninth Symphony
without rehearsal. It was one of his final appearances; according
to the Atlanta Symphony, Mr. Shaw's last concert was Dec. 18 when
he conducted the Christmas portion of Handel's ``Messiah'' and
Bach's ``Magnificat'' there.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a minister, Mr. Shaw in his own way was always a
preacher bearing glad tidings, a musical gospel. Born April 30,
1916, in Red Bluff, Calif., he studied at Pomona College. His first
job was as interim conductor of the Pomona College Glee Club during
a year when the music director was ill. Later Mr. Shaw went to work
for Fred Waring, creating a 24-voice glee club for the popular
tours and weekly broadcasts of Waring and his Pennsylvanians. It
was during this period that Mr. Shaw began to develop the ideals of
choral sound and the entirely practical techniques for producing it
consistently and reliably that revolutionized the American choral
scene. ``Tone is not an inescapable given,'' Mr. Shaw said in a
1996 interview with the Globe. ``It is something that must vary
with language and with the style of the historical period.'' Mr.
Shaw's arrangements, many of them made in collaboration with Alice
Parker, went into the library of schools across the country; they
are still in daily use today, preserving a repertory and exercising
the ear of everyone who sings them, or hears them. In the 1996
interview, he said, ``I believe that for immemorial ages, humanity
has refined folk songs to a unique purity of utterance and, I must
say, purity of ethics. I am equally moved by the great oratorios
and the simple folk songs and spirituals! There is such a large
difference between this kind of music and the kind that is created
largely for the profit motive. To me, it is terrifying the way that
religious services have been invaded by this commercial swill _ and
this passes for worship! I can't help thinking that both our
government and our religious institutions are abnegating the
dignity of the human animal. That's why I believe the arts can be
our salvation.''
</P>
<P>
   One doesn't think of Mr. Shaw in terms of the early-music
movement, but he was certainly one of its progenitors; his
performances, recordings, and tours of ``Messiah'' and the major
choral works of Bach were revolutionary. By today's standard, Mr.
Shaw's performances can seem old-fashioned, but that is because he
was so profoundly engaged with the meaning of music and text and
the spiritual dimension of performance, which he spoke of
unabashedly; he bombarded his colleagues with inspiring
communications about the importance of communication. He wasn't
pretentious about it however; he made a famous quip about amateur
musicians (and all his life he was eager to work with amateurs).
``Music, like sex,'' he said, ``is too importnat to leave to the
professionals.''
</P>
<P>
   John Oliver, founder and conductor of the Tanglewood Festival
Chorus, collaborated with Mr. Shaw during the last few years.
Monday, Oliver said, ``The sound of the Robert Shaw Chorale is what
all of us heard to begin with. I first enountered it in Bach's
B-Minor Mass in South Bend, Ind., in 1960 or 1961, and I was
astonished both by the piece and by the beauty of the execution; it
changed my life. So it was like a blessing . . . to have the
opportunity to have him join . . . us.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so humble in the face of music _ he probably studied
harder than anybody I ever met; he was on an endless quest,''
Oliver said. ``He would hand you a new sheaf of notes every day,
not that he meant to hold you to them; he would talk about the
music and what it meant to the orchestra and chorus, and you'd be
astonished how many conductors come through and never refer to the
piece! Music was such a source of stimulation to him, and his
imagination about music never stopped working. Yet he was an earthy
character. I remember when we came off the stage after that
gorgeous Beethoven Ninth at Tanglewood, he had a new off-color
story about President Clinton to tell me.''
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his sons Peter, John and Thomas, a daughter,
Johanna, a stepson, a sister, and a brother. No services have been
announced.

ATLANTA'S REEVES CAN'T GET A BREAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Let's hope Dan Reeves takes a nice, long rest after the
Super Bowl. He needs it.
</P>
<P>
   First, he had quadruple heart bypass surgery on Dec. 14, then
returned a couple weeks later, a little weak but plenty willing, to
lead the Atlanta Falcons on their improbable playoff run.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves' team does his heart no good in eking out a two-point win
over the San Francisco 49ers in a divisional playoff game, followed
by a nervy, overtime victory over the Minnesota Vikings on the road
in the NFC Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the Super Bowl hype machine, which Reeves helped
jump-start by going over his fractured relationships with Mike
Shanahan and John Elway in Denver. Shanahan responded in kind to
make this a two-against-one hissing match.
</P>
<P>
   What a week it will be rehashing all the bitterness and mistrust
that compelled Reeves, then Denver's coach, to fire Shanahan, his
offensive coordinator, after the 1991 season. With Elway
sufficiently alienated from his head coach, Reeves himself was
fired a year later.
</P>
<P>
   This guarantees a lively Super Bowl week. The effect of this
soap opera, however, obscures the reality of Reeves as one of the
best coaches in the game. He joins Bill Parcells and Don Shula as
the only coaches to take two different franchises to the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Three times Reeves got the Broncos to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   While Reeves' relationships with Shanahan and Elway are beyond
repair, he still has an ally in Broncos owner Pat Bowlen, who spoke
to his former coach on the phone last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I congratulated him on a great job,'' Bowlen said. ``I said to
him I'm personally very impressed by the job you've done there,
taking a team that wasn't going anywhere two years ago, and now
you're in the Super Bowl. I was sort of amused that all I kept
hearing about was what a great coach Bill Parcells is, blah, blah,
blah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, guess who's playing in the Super Bowl after two years
with a team that was just as rotten as the Jets when he came in?
Dan Reeves. And he beat a hell of a team to get there. In hostile
territory. Nobody was paying attention to what he did with the
Falcons because all the attention was going to Parcells.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves will get plenty of attention as he explains, again and
again, his relationships with Shanahan and Elway. It will be
interesting to see if the two coaches shake hands after the game.

ROBERT SHAW, 82; INNOVATIVE CHORAL COMPOSER FOR HALF-CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Shaw, the dominant figure in American choral music for
more than half a century, died Monday in New Haven, Conn.; he was
82 and had suffered a stroke. He was visiting Yale to see a
production of Samuel Beckett's ``Endgame,'' which his son Thomas
directed and acted in.
</P>
<P>
   With the founding of New York's Collegiate Chorale in 1941, Mr.
Shaw launched a career that changed the way American choruses
sounded _ and wanted to sound. In 1948 he founded the Robert Shaw
Chorale, which toured the world and recorded many central
masterpieces of the choral literature as well as best-selling
albums of Mr. Shaw's arrangements of folk songs, Christmas carols,
and spirituals. The Robert Shaw Chorale embarked on famous
collaborations with Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony (after
hearing his first Shaw rehearsal for the finale of Beethoven's
Ninth Symphony, Toscanini cried, ``It is the first time I hear it
sung!''). From 1956-67, Mr. Shaw was associate conductor of the
Cleveland Orchestra, developing one of America's greatest
orchestral choruses and building a partnership with George Szell
that rivaled his collaboration with Toscanini; in this period Mr.
Shaw was also able to explore conducting the orchestral literature.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967 he became music director of the Atlanta Symphony, a
position he held until 1988; he built the orchestra into an
institution of stature and made a long list of prize-winning
recordings there, while continuing to make guest appearances
elsewhere _ his only operatic conducting was for Sarah Caldwell's
production of Berlioz's ``The Damnation of Faust'' with the Opera
Company of Boston in 1978. In the last decade Mr. Shaw had
continued to appear regularly in Atlanta and elsewere, while
supervising annual choral institutes in France and in Carnegie
Hall. He had also become an annual guest of Boston University,
where the choral program is led by one of his protegees, Ann Howard
Jones; over the last few years Mr. Shaw had led memorable student
performances of Honegger's ``King David,'' Haydn's ``The
Creation,'' and the Brahms ``German Requiem''; he had been
scheduled to return next week.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Shaw served on the faculty at Tanglewood from 1942-45 and
returned 50 years later to resume an association with the Boston
Symphony Orchestra that resulted in notable performances of the
Mozart ``Requiem,'' Stravinsky's ``Symphony of Psalms,'' and
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. On opening night of the current season
last September, Mr. Shaw flew in to replace Seiji Ozawa at the gala
concert celebrating Ozawa's 25 seasons as music director; with
utter professional aplomb, Mr. Shaw led Beethoven's Ninth Symphony
without rehearsal. It was one of his final appearances; according
to the Atlanta Symphony, Mr. Shaw's last concert was Dec. 18 when
he conducted the Christmas portion of Handel's ``Messiah'' and
Bach's ``Magnificat'' there.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a minister, Mr. Shaw in his own way was always a
preacher bearing glad tidings, a musical gospel. Born April 30,
1916, in Red Bluff, Calif., he studied at Pomona College. His first
job was as interim conductor of the Pomona College Glee Club during
a year when the music director was ill. Later Mr. Shaw went to work
for Fred Waring, creating a 24-voice glee club for the popular
tours and weekly broadcasts of Waring and his Pennsylvanians. It
was during this period that Mr. Shaw began to develop the ideals of
choral sound and the entirely practical techniques for producing it
consistently and reliably that revolutionized the American choral
scene. ``Tone is not an inescapable given,'' Mr. Shaw said in a
1996 interview with the Globe. ``It is something that must vary
with language and with the style of the historical period.'' Mr.
Shaw's arrangements, many of them made in collaboration with Alice
Parker, went into the library of schools across the country; they
are still in daily use today, preserving a repertory and exercising
the ear of everyone who sings them, or hears them. In the 1996

religious services have been invaded by this commercial swill _ and
this passes for worship! I can't help thinking that both our
government and our religious institutions are abnegating the
dignity of the human animal. That's why I believe the arts can be
our salvation.''

``Music, like sex,'' he said, ``is too importnat to leave to the

 &HT;    Seven jurors selected in Texas dragging death trial
 &HT;    By Zach Maxwell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER _ The first seven of more than 100 potential jurors in
the capital murder trial of John William King will be interviewed
today by attorneys in the case of the 24-year-old who stands
accused of dragging James Byrd Jr. to his death last year.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Guy James Gray and King's defense team of C.
Hayden ``Sonny'' Cribbs and Brack Jones whittled 11 people _
including a 62-year-old woman who brought a gun to the Jasper
County Courthouse _ from an original list of 133 potential jurors.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Joe Bob Golden issued more than 200
summonses, and case officials blamed fear of the trial's spotlight
and a foggy East Texas morning for the low jury pool turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have liked to have had 150,'' Gray said. ``The nature
of the case'' scared some people away, he said.
</P>
<P>
   An unidentified woman was arrested after a search of her purse
turned up a small revolver, according to Jasper Police Chief
Stanley Christopher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not believe the lady intentionally brought the weapon to
harm anyone,'' he said. ``But we will not tolerate it.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman was charged with unlawfully carrying a weapon and
later was released on $5,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
   A contingent of about 30 officers from local, state and federal
agencies watched over the courthouse and patrolled downtown streets
on foot, according to Jasper County Constable Ralph Nichols.
Bomb-sniffing dogs were brought in from Fort Polk, La., in a
precautionary sweep of the 110-year-old building early Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The mood during opening procedures and remarks was much more
calm, with King sitting in thought through most of the 3 1/2 hours
of Monday's events, wearing a blue and white button-down shirt,
khaki pants and black loafers. He also sported a stun belt, with
Jasper County Sheriff Billy Rowles and a jailer ready to give him
eight-second, 50,000-volt shocks if they deemed it necessary.
</P>
<P>
   King faces life in prison or the death penalty for his part in
what officials say was a racially-motivated hate crime. Byrd, 49,
was dragged behind a truck three miles down a rural county road on
June 7, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Allen Berry and Lawrence Russell Brewer also face capital
murder charges, with their trials stacked up behind King's and
possibly other un-related capital murders on the Jasper County
docket. The trio faces capital murder charges because prosecutors
allege the killing occurred during the commission of another crime:
kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Before noon, the juror list in King's trial was down to 122,
including 21 blacks. Four women and three men were scheduled to be
questioned by attorneys on both sides as selection of 12 jurors and
two alternates entered a second day. Both sides expected the
process to last two or more weeks, but Gray estimated the actual
trial would last six to eight days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury selection will probably last longer than the actual
case,'' he said in court.
</P>
<P>
   Gray offered a horrific glimpse into the crime, how Byrd was
alive and conscious at the time the dragging began, using his
elbows and arms ``in whatever way he could to keep his head and
shoulders from the pavement.'' A handful of jurors closed their
eyes at the image.
</P>
<P>
   The fatal blow, Gray said, came when the truck entered the
blacktop portion of Huff Creek Road and slung Byrd's body into a
concrete culvert, ripping apart his head and shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Gray told possible jurors, the black man's body was
dumped at a black cemetery ``as some form of message.''
</P>
<P>
   One woman expressed concern that her visit to the crime scene
would disqualify her, but Gray said that may not be automatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are a lot of people that have driven out there
and looked down that road,'' he said.

MAYOR OF SHANGHAI SEEKS TO CALM INVESTOR JITTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also CHINA-ELECT) 
 (nk) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ In an effort to ease international concern
about the health of China's financial institutions, the mayor of
Shanghai said Monday that state-owned investment companies in the
nation's largest city were solvent, in contrast with those in the
southern province of Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Xu Kuangdi acknowledged that the recent closing of the
Guangdong International Trust and Investment Co., or Gitic, had
caused widespread concern among China's provincial leaders, many of
whom have started attending finance classes in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The closing of Gitic has attracted a lot of attention and
people are looking at the situation in Shanghai,'' Xu said at a
rare news conference here. ``I'm very happy to tell you that the
financial situation is very healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Asian financial crisis began in 1997, investors
and market analysts have expressed concern about the health of
China's banks and investment companies, thought to be weighed down
with mountains of bad debt. There has also been widespread concern
about whether China would devalue its currency, the yuan.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, stock and bond markets in Asia again fed on rumors that
China might devalue its currency after the recent devaluation of
Brazil's currency, the real.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Walker, the chief economist for CLSA Global Emerging
Markets, predicted that China would devalue the yuan by about 10
percent in the second half of 1999, which could help bolster the
economy by making exports less expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Yet market analysts who follow China say the pressure for such a
move is no stronger now that it was last year, when speculation of
an imminent devaluation proved untrue.
</P>
<P>
   John Pinkel, who heads China equity research for Merrill Lynch
(Asia Pacific), pointed out that China still had a healthy trade
surplus of more than $40 billion, a high level of foreign exchange
reserves at $145 billion and tight controls over the conversion of
currency.
</P>
<P>
   With concern about the coming 10th anniversary of the Tiananmen
crackdown in June, Pinkel added, there is even less likelihood that
Beijing could consider a potentially disruptive move.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for China's central bank told Reuters that a report
in an official newspaper suggesting that a devaluation might not be
a bad move was untrue. The spokesman called the report ``a private
opinion'' and said it did not reflect the point of view of the
People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
   Making China's exports cheaper, many economists argue, is an
inefficient way to strengthen the economy. In the long run,
maintaining the currency makes economic sense by providing a stable
environment for both foreign and domestic investment.

<P>
   Prime Minister Zhu Rongji said recently that China would not
allow a devaluation this year.

<P>
   In Shanghai, Xu said that the Shanghai International Trust and
Investment Corp. had total assets of $3 billion and net assets of
about $400 million. The company has international debt of only
about $150 million, Xu also said, and only a small portion is
short-term debt.
</P>
<P>
   The closing of Gitic has shocked many foreign bankers accustomed
to the notion that a politically well-connected company could never
fail in China. Xu pointed out that the closing was a move away from
automatic guarantees of corporate debt and toward a more
market-based system of lending.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last week, China's big state banks reported strong
profits in 1998 even if their numbers shielded the true amount of
bad debts from failing state industries.
</P>
<P>
   The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China reported profits of
$409 million, up 10 percent compared with results in 1997, while
the Bank of China earned $421 million, down sharply from $720
million. The Construction Bank's 1998 profits were $102 million.
</P>
<P>
   Xu pointed with some pride to the steady economic growth that
continued here despite the disastrous slowdown plaguing many other
cities in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Riding a stunning 25 percent increase in government
infrastructure spending, Shanghai's economy grew 10.1 percent in
1998, or slightly faster than China's national rate of 7.8 percent.

him for an impromptu two-lawmaker debate on a freefall of a day in

own sense of gridlock with colloquy that was dignified, if not

JUSTICES RULE AGAINST STATISTICAL SAMPLING IN 2000 CENSUS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A sharply divided Supreme Court on Monday struck
down President Clinton's controversial proposal to use a
statistical formula to complement the traditional head count of the
U.S. population in the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, stung by the decision, might try to
conduct two counts of the U.S. population next year to ensure a
true result, Commerce Secretary William Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   That would depend on whether the Republican-led Congress, which
opposes statistical sampling, provides enough money for the Census
Bureau to conduct two counts.
</P>
<P>
   Daley, whose department conducts the census, said he was
``obviously disappointed'' with the court's decision. He said that
enhancing the head count with a statistical sampling is the best
way to prevent a repeat of the 1990 census, when 8 million people
were not counted.
</P>
<P>
   Daley said an additional survey, independent of the
constitutionally required Census, would be more accurate and ensure
that federal aid to the poor will be spent in the most needy areas.
</P>
<P>
   In its 5-4 decision, the high court ruled that Clinton's effort
to achieve a truer count through statistics runs afoul of the
federal Census Act, which the court said prohibits the federal
government from using statistics in addition to the standard
head-count census of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Census is conducted every 10 years to determine how the 435
seats in the House of Representatives will be apportioned among the
50 states.
</P>
<P>
   Daley, seizing on the court's finding that statistics may not be
used for apportionment, said the justices held open the legality of
using mathematical formulas for other purposes, such as finding
poor people who qualify for federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``A census based upon the old method will produce tremendous
undercounts,'' Daley said. ``We (at the Census Bureau) are
committed to having the most accurate census.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gene Green, D-Texas, assailed the high court's ruling,
saying statistics are the most effective way to prevent a repeat of
the undercount of Houston's population in 1990. That undercount, he
added, cost the city much needed federal assistance for social
programs.
</P>
<P>
   More than 66,000 people in Houston were not counted in the 1990
census.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to redouble our efforts to count everyone
in Houston,'' Green said. ``We pay the tax dollars, and we should
receive the benefits from them. If we're undercounted, those tax
dollars will go someplace else.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's decision marked a victory for the House and
16 people who sued the Clinton administration. The private citizens
wanted to force the president to abandon his proposal to use
statistics in addition to the traditional head count of the U.S.
population.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, D-Ill., hailed the court's
decision as an affirmation of the constitutional principle that
people should be counted, not scientifically polled. ``The
administration should abandon its illegal and risky polling scheme
and start preparing for a true head count,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the House Government Reform
Subcommittee on the Census, also praised the high court's decision
for ensuring that ``no administration would be permitted to
manipulate the census for its own political gain.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans have said Clinton wants to curry favor
with minorities and poor people, groups that are historically
undercounted and a traditional Democratic constituency.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration expects 67 percent of the U.S.
population to return completed census forms, which will be mailed
nationwide next year. The population would then be divided into
census tracts of about 4,000 people that have ``homogenous
population characteristics, economic status and living
conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau agents would then visit a randomly selected sample
of the housing units that did not submit census forms. The sample's
population numbers and characteristics would be added based on the
statistical results.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration argued that a statistical estimate is
needed for an accurate count. But the House Republicans and the
individuals countered that the Census Act and the Constitution
permit only an ``actual enumeration,'' or head count, for the
census.
</P>
<P>
   Federal district courts in Washington and eastern Virginia
agreed that the act prohibits statistical samples. The courts,
having decided the case on statutory grounds, did not reach the
issue of whether the Constitution permits statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the majority, agreed
with the lower courts and said Congress has prohibited the use of
statistics ever since the first census in 1790, when lawmakers
required census takers to swear to make ``a just and perfect
enumeration'' of every person in their districts. While federal law
permits statistics to be used to measure demographic data at other
times, the Census Act expressly prohibits their use for ``purposes
of apportionment'' of House members, O'Connor added.
</P>
<P>
   The high court, like the district courts, did not address the
issue of whether the Constitution bars statistics in calculating
the census, having resolved the legal issue based on the federal
law. Joining O'Connor's opinion were Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Antonin Scalia and
Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   In a vehement dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens said Congress
in 1976 amended the Census Act to permit the type of statistical
sampling the president wants to use next year. Stevens derided as
``an unusual tour de force'' the court's conclusion that the 1976
amendment did not change the federal government's authority with
regard to the census.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the court is correct, prior to 1976 the commerce secretary
could have used sampling for any census-related purpose except
apportionment, and after 1976 he retained precisely the same
authority,'' Stevens wrote. ``Why, one must wonder, did Congress
make this textual change in 1976?''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Stevens were Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Ruth Bader
Ginsburg and David H. Souter. Breyer also wrote separately to say
the Census Act permits statistics to be used to complement a
traditional head count but not to substitute for one.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, in her majority opinion, alienated Scalia and Thomas
in one part of her decision where she examined the legislative
history of the Census Act. O'Connor, in further explaining why the
Census Act bars statistics, wrote that no member of Congress during
the debate on the 1976 revision to the law ever said the amendment
would allow statistics to be part of the decennial population
survey.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia, an outspoken opponent of the use of legislative history
to determine what Congress intended, said such silence is
meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I join the opinion of the court, excluding, of course, its
resort ... to what was said by the individual legislators and
committees of legislators _ or more precisely (and worse yet), what
was not said by individual legislators and committees of
legislators,'' Scalia wrote in comments that Thomas joined.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Q. When our manager is out, I am the acting
manager. But as soon as she is out the door, there is an employee
who immediately stops working. He makes personal calls, plays on
the computer and generally does nothing. I have told him that he
needs to get back to work, but he ignores me. How can I get him to
listen to me? B.D. &QL; 
A. When you are the acting manager, the emphasis is on manager, and
not on acting. If this employee does not get the message you are
sending to him, then the message should be sent by your manager.
</P>
<P>
   The best step is for you to meet with your manager, explain the
situation and ask her to inform all of the employees that you are
the acting manager when she is out. The employees need to know that
it is a real mistake to think that when the manager goes out the
door, the rules go out too.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, if the employee in question continues his
questionable behavior, you should meet with him and discuss his
actions, express your disapproval, tell him that it is time to get
back to work and let him know that there are definite consequences
if he continues to do nothing. At this point, if he does not heed
what you are saying, note it in his file and let him read what you
are saying. &QL; 
Q. I manage a department of 15 people, and there is one who keeps
telling me how to do my job. He tells me what I should have done in
one situation and what I should do in another. Frankly, he is
nowhere near the expert he thinks he is. I do not like his behavior
and I have tried diplomatically to get him to stop, but he doesn't.
What can you suggest? W.A. &QL; 
A. You are in the middle of a power play, and your employee has
cast himself in the lead. Although you prefer that he focus more on
his job and less on yours, he feels that he can ignore your
diplomatic efforts and continue to tell you how to manage. And,
unless you take some action, he will only encroach further.
</P>
<P>
   The best step is to move from diplomacy to directness. You
should let him know that you are glad to have open discussions with
all of the employees regarding past decisions and future actions,
and you are certainly willing to listen to suggestions and act on
them when feasible, but the idea of continuously telling you how to
do your job is another matter entirely.
</P>
<P>
   This may not be the easiest feedback for your employee to
accept, but he needs to understand that it is time for him to
control himself rather than trying to control you, and the choice
is his. He can redirect his attention to his own job and provide
constructive input to you along the way, as is expected of all
employees, or he can ignore what you have said and continue to tell
you what you should be doing. However, if he takes the latter
approach, he may well become a former employee. &QL; 
Q. We have a kitchen employee in our restaurant who comes to work
every day wearing jeans. After about 20 minutes, his pants slide
down a little every time he bends. It's bad enough that this
happens in front of the other employees in the kitchen, but
occasionally he goes into the dining area. How can I ask him to
take care of this without offending him? R.H. &QL; 
A. You have an obviously hard-working employee whose performance
shows dedication and a lot more. It would indeed be easy to offend
and embarrass an employee in this situation, and a thoughtless
approach would not only hurt him, it would be hurtful to the rest
of the staff as well.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to deal with him is on an adult-to-adult basis. You
should meet with him in private and be honest, straightforward, and
clear. You can open the discussion by saying that you are pleased
with his work, but quickly get to the point.
</P>
<P>
   Describe the problem, and let him know how important it is to
him and to the restaurant that this matter be wrapped up quickly.
The next stop is to ask him if he thinks he can take care of this.
His reaction will tell you if you need to offer more guidance,
direction, or help.
</P>
<P>
   He should be provided with encouragement along the way, and with
positive feedback whenever he successfully covers this issue.

A CHINESE VILLAGE TAKES A LONELY NEW ROAD: DIRECT DEMOCRACY
</HEADLINE>
 (fb)  
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Apparently without formal approval from Beijing, a
remote farming region in central China has held the country's first
direct elections for leader of a township. And communist leaders in
Beijing signaled that they want this to be the last, at least for
now.
</P>
<P>
   Townships, which are units of about 10,000 or more people, are
one administrative step up from the villages, where elections have
been promoted for years. Townships have far more power over
taxation, land use and other matters, which would make elections at
that level far more meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   But because such vital and contentious affairs are at stake,
township elections are potentially more destabilizing, say experts
in China's rural affairs. Though farmers have long endured fiats
from above, local protests about taxes and corruption are rising.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Buyun township, the local party's favored
candidate won by a hair, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The Dec. 31 election in Buyun township _ a collection of
villages that is part of Suining city in central Sichuan province _
followed the general call by the Communist Party last fall to
``expand democracy at the grass roots.''
</P>
<P>
   China's leaders have promoted village elections as a way to vent
discontent and root out corrupt officials. In international forums
they often point to the elections as proof that a Chinese democracy
is evolving, and they vaguely suggested that elections would
gradually be extended to higher offices.
</P>
<P>
   None of the elections would meet Western standards of democracy,
because no candidates who question the primacy of the Communist
Party are allowed, information is controlled, and nonelected party
officials usually continue to set policies. Still, some villages
have had lively contests, and residents may enjoy unaccustomed
choices in local affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The township election last month had the support of party
officials in Sichuan Province, who saw it as an experiment in line
with national policy. But they were nervous about it and they tried
to bar publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Only in mid-January was the election reported. The Southern
Weekend, a major newspaper published in faraway Guangdong Province,
printed an article on the election.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, in what political experts here interpret as a
gentle but clear ``no'' to further direct voting in townships, The
Legal Daily, an important party paper in Beijing, carried an
editorial titled ``Democracy Should Not Overstep the Law.'' The
Sichuan election showed the people's awareness of democracy, the
editorial said, but ``regrettably the election itself violates the
constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the editorial reflects disagreement among senior leaders
or Beijing simply got cold feet as it contemplated opening up
township office to voters is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   To carry out development works or to swell their own pockets
township officials often seek to raise money from villagers, said
David Zweig, a rural expert at the Hong Kong University of Science
and Technology. They are thus at the center of rural conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the goal is to increase stability,'' Zweig said, then
national leaders may wonder, ```Why take the risk of allowing
township elections now?'''
</P>
<P>
   Why officials in this part of Sichuan forged ahead is also
unclear, although one local party leader was quoted as having said,
``With expanding grass-roots democracy direct election of township
heads is going to happen sooner or later.'' That experiment could
be a model.
</P>
<P>
   In late November, according to the account in The Southern
Weekend, a notice of the election was transmitted on local cable
television. At a meeting of party leaders and other village
representatives, two candidates _ a schoolteacher and a popular
village leader _ were elected from 15 who volunteered. The party
put up a third candidate, the deputy party secretary of the
township.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the candidates publicly debated and, the newspaper
reported, voters gradually came to see the party candidate, Tan
Xiaoqiu, as the strongest. The teacher and village leader came
across as less informed and worldly, according to the account,
while Tan touted his contacts outside the locality and promised to
raise incomes.
</P>
<P>
   In voting by secret ballot on Dec. 31, Tan received just over
half the votes. When he was sworn in on Jan. 4, he reportedly said:
``I pledge to all the members of the township that I will dedicate
myself to the motherland, dedicate myself to the townsfolk, observe
the constitution and the laws, give my all to my job, remain clean
and noncorrupt, strive to govern for the people, and sacrifice all
I have for the interests of all the townsfolk.''

 &HT;    BellSouth stock slumps despite earnings news
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth stock took a shellacking Monday despite the
fact earnings exceeded analysts' expectations for the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Its shares fell $5.06 1/2 to $43, driven down by a Supreme Court
decision seen as unfavorable to regional phone companies, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth reported income of $831 million, excluding one-time
items, up 16.7 percent from the 1997 fourth quarter. Revenue was
$6.17 billion, up 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Per share earnings were 42 cents, excluding one-time items,
against 36 cents a year ago, and a forecast of 41 cents.
</P>
<P>
   With revenue growing across a spectrum of services, the company
added to its workforce last year for the first time since 1992.
About 88,450 people now work for BellSouth, up from about 81,000 a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has faced analyst criticism for sticking to a
go-it-alone strategy while a number of rivals go the merger route.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Mel Marten of Edward Jones &AMP; Co. said BellSouth
continues to undermine criticism. ``I think BellSouth is going to
continue to do pretty well. They talk about remaining a stand-alone
company and this signals that they do not have to run out and do
something.''
</P>
<P>
   During the last three months of the year, BellSouth added
128,000 lines for residents _ representing installation of more
than 1,000 lines a day. Of those, 95,000 were additional lines for
fax machines, Internet connections and extra voice lines. Those
numbers bode well for the company's future _ so long as customers
leasing those lines remain BellSouth customers. Probably the most
lucrative part of the local phone business is in features like
Caller ID, Call Return and voice messaging, where demand has
ballooned. Those features accounted for $423 million revenue in the
fourth quarter, up 20 percent from the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth also reported healthy growth in other areas critical
to its efforts to compete against larger companies offering all
manner of services.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the company's wireless business added 255,000
customers in the United States during the last quarter of 1998.
BellSouth's international investments _ especially those in Latin
America _ also provided a growing chunk of revenue. That's sector's
revenue was up 71 percent in the quarter to $661 million.

 &HT;    'Turbulent times' await employees as health care costs rise,
survey shows
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After four years of low growth, the cost of health
benefits rose 6.1 percent in 1998 for U.S. employers, with an even
higher increase projected for this year.
</P>
<P>
   The widely watched William M. Mercer survey of employer health
costs, released today, also found that Atlanta-based employer costs
rose slightly less, at 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some turbulent times ahead,'' said Lew Yeouze of
William M. Mercer. ``Most employers see 9 percent to 10 percent
increases in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   That's significantly higher than the inflation rate, noted
Georgia State University health economist Bill Custer, after
reviewing the Mercer results. ``And so it's possible we're going to
return to the ailments in the health system of the late 1980s and
early 1990s _ rising costs, and increases in the uninsured.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the increase arises from prescription drugs, the Mercer
survey found. Employers reported average pharmaceutical hikes of
13.8 percent. As a result, HMO patients' out-of-pocket costs
recently have been raised.
</P>
<P>
   To contain their medical bills, Custer said, employers may use
more aggressive tactics, such as limiting workers' choice of
providers, reducing benefits, or raising the price for dependents'
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the average cost of covering active and retired
employees surpassed the $4,000 mark, to $4,164, for the first time
in the 13 years of the survey, which covered almost 4,200
employers.
</P>
<P>
   Yeouze cautioned that companies' use of Point-of-Service (POS)
plans _ similar to HMOs, but which allow patients to go to
non-network doctors at a higher price _ could eventually lead to a
higher medical tab.
</P>
<P>
   POS plans nationally cost $3,573. Traditional insurance averaged
$3,788. HMOs, meanwhile, averaged $3,215, with PPOs, another
managed-care plan allowing choice, at $3,494.Only 13 percent of
U.S. employees now belong to traditional insurance, down from 48
percent five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In other survey findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ The South remain the least expensive region, with active
employee costs at $3,438. The average cost for active employees
reached $4,340 in the Northeast, $3,900 in the Midwest, and $3,626
in the West.
</P>
<P>
   _ Legislation to establish parity between general physical
health benefits and mental health has not proved to raise costs
significantly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Employers are continuing to drop retiree coverage.

 &HT;    Southern Co. wants to expand investments
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Southern Co. is seeking approval to more than double _
to almost $8 billion _ its investments in unregulated businesses
outside its primary Southeast service territory.
</P>
<P>
   In papers filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
Atlanta-based utility holding company sought a waiver that would
allow it to invest an equivalent of 175 percent of its consolidated
retained earnings in unregulated businesses inside and outside the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   As of Dec. 30, Southern had invested $3.4 billion _ or 87
percent _ of the $3.9 billion currently authorized in such
ventures. Those projects include utilities and power plants in
Britain, China, the Philippines, Brazil, Chile, Argentina and
Germany as well as a growing network of plants around the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Southern announced it would leave its dividend
unchanged for the first time since 1991. It also said it would
reduce the payout ratio over time to retain cash for new
investments.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Wakefield, senior vice president and general counsel,
said decision on its dividend and the latest SEC filing were ``two
parts of a strategy to finance the growth of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1935 Public Utility Holding Company Act prohibits Southern
and 18 other interstate utilities from investing more than 50
percent of retained earnings in unregulated ventures without SEC
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Southern, the parent of Georgia Power and four other utilities
serving the Southeast, is seeking repeal of the law. In 1996, the
company became the first of the group to get an SEC waiver to raise
the limit to 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With this latest filing, which was made Jan. 15, Southern
becomes the first to seek permission to go above that level. A
number of utilities that are not regulated by the Holding Company
Act are already investing at that level.
</P>
<P>
   According to the company's SEC filing, it wants approval to
invest up to $4 billion _ in addition to the $3.9 billion already
authorized _ in unregulated ventures through Dec. 31, 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield said the company anticipates most of the new
investments will be for unregulated generating plants inside the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   With recently announced acquisitions in California and New York,
``we're pressing the limit'' currently authorized, the executive
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rita Kilpatrick, executive director of the Campaign for a
Prosperous Georgia, which unsuccessfully challenged Southern's
first waiver in court, said the Atlanta-based consumer advocacy
group would file papers with the SEC objecting to Southern's latest
request.
</P>
<P>
   Kilpatrick noted Southern has been forced to take a onetime
charge of $200 million over failed South American investments.
</P>
<P>
   Southern should not be given a ``blank check'' to expand its
investments, Kilpatrick said. ``They need to be scrutinized very
carefully.'' Southern, the largest U.S. electricity generator which
likes to call itself the industry's ``900-pound gorilla,'' reported
net income of $977 million on revenue of $11.4 billion for 1998.

GETTING NO BENEFIT FROM DOUBT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - In 1997, Cindy Silverman was one of 16 individuals in
the United States to receive the President's Service Award for
outstanding community service work.
</P>
<P>
   These days, she gets hate calls.
</P>
<P>
   Silverman is the founder and director of New Beginnings
Transitional Home. She's shared banquet tables and podiums with
everyone from the president to Arizona's current governor.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she's being shunned.
</P>
<P>
   Four recently scheduled speaking engagements have been
cancelled, a setback for Silverman, who uses public appearances to
solicit donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a nightmare,'' she says. ``I've gotten some very
nasty comments. I've gotten a lot of cold shoulders. It's like I've
committed some unspeakable offense. I honestly didn't expect that
kind of reaction. I didn't see it coming. Really, am I gulity of
some horrific crime?``
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   Of course not.
</P>
<P>
   It's worse than that.
</P>
<P>
   What Silverman did _ and continues to do _ is give the benefit
of the doubt to a Elizabeth Shannon Whittle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to protect her constitutional rights,'' Silverman
says. ``For that, some people are mad at me.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago this month, 23-year-old Whittle gave birth to
quadruplets. She and her boyfriend, 21-year-old Anthony Perez, had
little money and few resources, at least until the story of
Whittle's pregnancy made the papers.
</P>
<P>
   Following the birth of Megan Elizabeth, Anthony Thomas, Robert
Michael and Damian Matthew, Whittle and Perez got lots of attention
and gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, however, Whittle was arrested and accused of child
abuse. Perez also was charged. Doctors discovered the infants had
suffered injuries ranging from bruises to broken bones to skull
fractures. Some will never recover. Whittle's bond was set at
$250,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I went to the jail and spoke to Shannon, I came to
believe that she's not the person police made her out to be,''
Silverman says. ``But she doesn't have money. Posting bond was not
an option for her.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Silverman convinced a few wealthy benefactors to donate the
$25,600 fee needed to get Whittle out of jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this country, you're supposed to be `innocent until proven
guilty,' '' Silverman says. ``That isn't just the right of rich
people. For some reason, though, helping Shannon made people act
like I had done something criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't caused Silverman to back off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do people believe every woman in a shelter is Nicole Brown
Simpson in disguise?'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder if they realize the type of women who wind up at New
Beginnings. Often, they've burned all their bridges. They've been
abused. They have no parenting skills. They may have drug or
alcohol problems. Why do you think most shelters have education
programs? It's to teach them to be good mothers. That's our
clientele.''
</P>
<P>
   The case against Whittle appears solid, at least from what's
been in the paper. And there's nothing worse than hurting a baby.
Silverman isn't sure a fair trial is possible, given all the
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel betrayed because there was an outpouring of good
wishes for this woman and then these accusations surfaced,'' she
says. ``But I believe there is reasonable doubt. If not, if Shannon
is found guilty, my work will go on. I won't regret having helped
her, though.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the effect on your business and your life? she is
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been hard,'' she says, ``but I'd do it again in a minute.
Advocating for those who can't do it for themselves is part of my
job. At least, that's how I always looked at it, and always will.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Silverman would help Whittle doesn't prove
anything about the accused mother's guilt or innocence.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Silverman would risk her reputation and her
livelihood to serve a principle does prove something about her,
however.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the fact that she's been criticized and condemned for
her actions proves something about us. &QL;

   SIERRA-LEONE-TERROR (Freetown, Sierra Leone) _ ``I asked them to
kill me now,'' Mohammed Sesay remembered pleading after he was
caught by rebels gripping machetes. But they ignored him. They held
his arms flat on a tree stump. And he felt the machete fall on a
wrist, then on the other. ``This is an example to show the
president,'' the rebels told him. Hacking off hands and feet of
ordinary people has been a key weapon of a widespread campaign of
terror and butchery waged by rebels trying to overthrow this
ravaged country's president. In recent days, the fighting has
reached the capital, marking another brutish turn in a civil war

SENATORS TINKER WITH LESSER PUNISHMENTS FOR CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah, Maine, Ill.)  (See related stories: IMPEACH-RDP, IMPEACH-TRIAL, IMPEACH-SCENE,

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Senate struggles toward a resolution of the
impeachment trial, some lawmakers have put forward compromise
proposals with a common approach: enabling the Senate to affirm the
truth of the accusations against President Clinton without voting
to remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Judiciary Committee,
and freshman Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, have been tinkering with
separate proposals along those lines.
</P>
<P>
   But to adopt such an approach would require a thoroughly novel
interpretation of the Constitution's instructions about
impeachment. Under the traditional and widely held view of the
impeachment clauses, conviction by the Senate is tantamount to
removal from office. It would, in fact, be unprecedented for the
Senate to convict an official at an impeachment trial and not
remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a scholarly underpinning for an approach in
which conviction is separated from removal. It is contained in an
article by Professor Joseph Isenbergh of the University of Chicago
Law School that radically reinterprets the Constitution's
instructions on impeachment. Isenbergh says, in essence, that while
the Constitution requires removal for conviction of high crimes and
misdemeanors, it also may be read to permit impeachment for lesser
offenses, which would allow for lesser punishments.
</P>
<P>
   Article One of the Constitution, which deals with the powers of
Congress, says that the penalty for impeachment ``shall not extend
further'' than removal from office and prohibition from holding
office in the future. Article Two, which deals with the powers and
limitations of the executive branch, requires removal for
``conviction of treason, bribery or other high crimes and
misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   Isenbergh's article, which is on the law school's Web site, says
that Article One does not prevent impeachment for lesser crimes. It
then follows, the professor argues, that if removal is mandated for
only high crimes in Article Two, a lesser punishment would be
allowed for lesser crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Isenbergh says that lesser crimes would be those that are not
against the state and that would allow Congress to deal with
situations in which a president may have committed a common crime
like assault or business fraud. ``Congress has more flexibility in
dealing with those crimes than it does for high crimes and
misdemeanors, crimes against the state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Isenbergh, in an interview Monday, said that he had received
queries about the article from a few Senate offices, although not
those of Hatch or Collins.

IN FAREWELL TO MEXICO, POPE PLEADS FOR FAITH TO HELP SOLVE SOCIAL
PROBLEMS
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ John Paul II bade farewell to Mexico on Monday
with a spiritual message aimed straight at the country's social and
political ills.
</P>
<P>
   Faith, he said, must help society, especially the peasants and
indigenous peoples, overcome ``the corruption that permeates many
institutions and many citizens.'' He called on the country to
``root out drug trafficking, based on the lack of values, on the
lure of easy gain, and on youthful inexperience, to put an end to
the violence that divides brothers and social classes.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who addressed a fervent crowd of 100,000 at the Aztec
Stadium, the last large public event of his trip, sought to focus
believers on the demands of their faith in the coming millennium.
But his remarks also carried a strong political resonance in a
country where corruption and economic inequality is entrenched and
the church is increasingly outspoken about social and economic
injustice.
</P>
<P>
   After 70 years of fierce anticlericalism, the Mexican government
finally recognized religious freedom in 1991 and restored
diplomatic relations with the Vatican the next year. Though
relations between the church and the government have improved
markedly since the pope first visited Mexico in 1979, deep
disagreements remain. The pope's visit united millions of Roman
Catholics in a four-day frenzy of joy and excitement. But it also
heightened the tensions between the Catholic church and the state.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps emboldened by the pope's presence, the leader of
Mexico's Catholic church, Cardinal Norberto Rivera Carrera,
delivered what many Mexicans view as his sharpest critique of the
country's leadership to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``People suffer and grow desperate because they see no imminent
solution to their cries for justice, food, health care, well
remunerated work,'' the cardinal told the pope at a Mass on Sunday
that was attended by more than a million people. ``Peace doesn't
seem close enough, and sometimes they feel like a puppet, no longer
manipulated by visible strings, but by remote control.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican newspapers carried the cardinal's remarks on their front
pages.
</P>
<P>
   The leftist newspaper La Jornada described them as ``an open
outburst by the Catholic hierarchy into earthly affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   During his stay, the pope did not refer to Chiapas, the state
where Indians and leftist guerrillas are in open rebellion against
the government.
</P>
<P>
   But his comments in support of the poor and the indigenous
populations were seized upon by the embattled bishop of Chiapas,
Samuel Ruiz, as vindication of his work with Indians and poor
people there. Conservatives have accused Ruiz, who acted as
mediator between local Indians and the government until last year,
of supporting the armed rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Many Mexican conservatives _ in government and also in the
Vatican _ complain that Ruiz has crossed the line into liberation
theology, which the pope began stamping out after his first visit
to Mexico in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, the pope asked the young to make a Christian
effort to improve society. ``You young people of Mexico and America
must act so that the world, which one day will be entrusted to you,
will be oriented towards God, and that political institutions, or
scientific, financial, or cultural ones, put themselves at the real
service of man, without distinctions based on race or social
class,'' he said.

 &HT;    High court rules out 2000 census adjustment
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin and Elizabeth Kurylo
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday struck down plans by the
Clinton administration to use statistical sampling that supposedly
would enhance the accuracy of the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruling only bans using population projections for
allocating the seats in the U.S. House. It did not decide on the
constitutionality of statistical sampling, leaving open the
question of whether sampling could be used to determine how much
each state should receive of the $180 billion in federal funding
doled out each year for housing, education, health care and
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The court decision also did not address whether such sampling
could be used to determine how states draw boundary lines for their
legislative districts.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome will likely be decided after a showdown between the
White House and the Republican-controlled Congress, which must
appropriate funds for statistical sampling if it is to be used in
any way for the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of statistical sampling _ which estimates up to 10
percent of the population based on the characteristics of the 90
percent actually counted _ contend that the ruling means millions
of people will not be counted in the census, scheduled to be taken
April 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the very first census, the census of 1790, Congress has
prohibited the use of statistical sampling in calculating the
population for purposes of apportionment,'' Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor wrote for the 5-4 majority.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's ruling was a victory for the Atlanta-based Southeastern
Legal Foundation, a conservative public interest law firm that
filed suit against the counting method. Foundation President
Matthew Glavin said he was ``thrilled'' with the court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Clinton administration was trying to do was create 30
million mythical people,'' he said. ``They were going to decide
what those 30 million people looked like and where they lived. But
the Supreme Court said, 'No.'''
</P>
<P>
   Glavin, along with other individuals and governments in 13
states, including Cobb County, sued last February in federal court
in Alexandria, Va., where judges have a reputation for deciding
cases quickly.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) applauded the ruling. ``Both the
Constitution and federal law are very clear that only a full and
complete count, not a bureaucrat's best guess, are acceptable for
the census,'' said Barr, who was involved in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Several large cities, such as New York, Los Angeles and Chicago,
supported sampling, saying their municipalities will be
shortchanged if sampling is not used in the 2000 census. The
Clinton administration had argued that most of the ``uncounted''
people in a census are minorities and low-income residents.
</P>
<P>
   Wade Henderson, executive director of the Leadership Conference
on Civil Rights, called the ruling ``the latest in what has become
a disturbing trend of narrow 5-4 decisions that jeopardize the
nation's commitment to equal opportunity for all.'' Congress must
enact legislation that allows the Census Bureau to employ the most
up-to-date, scientific methods to conduct the most accurate and
complete census, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in metro Atlanta's Hispanic and Asian communities were
disappointed by the ruling, but said they would work even harder to
be sure everyone is counted in the 2000 census. Immigrants
traditionally have been undercounted because they do not trust the
government and believe the information may be used against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes our efforts doubly important and it makes our work a
little bit harder,'' said Maritza Keen, executive director of the
Latin American Association, which has been working since March on
plans to count every Latino in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Her group is working with the Los Angeles-based Mexican American
Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF), which opened a
regional office this month in Buckhead. It hopes to educate Latinos
about why they should fill out census forms, and it plans to
translate census information into Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, more than 1.5 million Latinos were not counted
nationwide, MALDEF says, resulting in the loss of millions in
federal funds to the cities. The 2000 census is especially
important for Latinos because they are projected to become the
nation's biggest minority group shortly after the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Choi, head of the Asian Coalition in metro Atlanta, said
he was hoping the Supreme Court would allow sampling because
minority groups have traditionally been undercounted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asians usually do not trust anyone from a government entity,''
he said. ``We have to educate our community and we need all the
help we can possibly get from our local and state governments to
count, as much as possible, all the minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart called the ruling a ``limited
decision'' and noted that the justices did not say sampling was
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.), ranking Democrat on the House
Census subcommittee, said the ruling ``left in place the
requirement to produce accurate, adjusted numbers for distributing
federal funds and drawing the lines of every federal, state and
local legislative district in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But Atlanta lawyer Joe Whitley, a member of the U.S. Census
Monitoring Board and a former U.S. attorney, said he hopes the
administration will drop the idea of statistical sampling. ``The
Supreme Court's opinion is one that should be honored by the
president and not bypassed with legislative chicanery,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Glavin said that if the administration tries to use sampling for
legislative redistricting, it will find itself in court again. ``If
the Republicans give in and let the president use a second set of
census numbers based on sampling, we're going to file a second
lawsuit,'' he said. ``It's just as illegal as using it for
apportionment.''

 &HT;    Smith working to get the Wildcats to `tighten up'
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a Jan. 16 game against Mississippi, Kentucky basketball coach
Tubby Smith benched Jamaal Magloire after the center lost his
temper and got a technical foul. Magloire compounded the offense
two days later by missing the team's 11 p.m. curfew.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's reaction was to suspend Magloire for the third time in
the past two seasons and to change everybody's curfew to 10 p.m. --
with Smith himself doing the bed checks at the Wildcat Lodge. Tubby
Smith now is the best-paid dorm monitor in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``He comes down the hallway and knocks on each door 'til
everybody comes out,'' senior forward Scott Padgett said.
</P>
<P>
   At halftime of that game at Mississippi, Kentucky trailed 34-31.
Smith, who is usually calm in the locker room, knocked a blackboard
off the wall trying to get his point across. In the second half,
Smith relentlessly stayed on his players and willed them to a 63-57
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was more intense everywhere,'' forward Michael Bradley said
after the game. ``On the floor, in the huddles.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people might think Smith's behavior a bit obsessive, with
his Wildcats the defending national champions and 17-4 this year,
including 6-1 and at the top of the SEC East entering tonight's
game against Georgia in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   But the events of the past two weeks have been Smith's way of
putting the 1999 Kentucky team on notice: It might not win the NCAA
title, but when it comes to discipline and dedication, he will
accept nothing less than a national-championship effort from this
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the time of the year to tighten up,'' Smith said.
``This is the time of year that you need to refocus and dedicate
yourself in all areas. You've got to have something to galvanize
your team.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago Smith got his team's attention by going back to 6
a.m. workouts and telling players they would have to shave all
facial hair. That team lost to Ole Miss on Feb. 14 and then did not
lose again, winning 13 games in a row and beating UCLA, Duke,
Stanford and Utah to win the NCAA championship.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky lost some talent from that team, including Jeff
</P>
<P>
   Sheppard, Nazr Mohammed and Allen Edwards. Smith was more
concerned that, after winning a championship, the Wildcats would
lose their hunger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just human nature,'' said Smith, who coached at Georgia
in 1996 and 1997 before taking the job at Kentucky. ``We have some
success, and our guys start reading that we're a team that turns it
on come March. Well, it doesn't work that way. In basketball, the
NCAA Tournament is your final exam. But if you haven't been
studying and learning and getting better each day, you're not going
to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   So Smith has pushed, challenged and cajoled, anything to keep
this team on edge. He has tried seven different lineups with 10
players getting at least one start. After a 47-46 home loss to
Tennessee on Jan. 12, Smith went from a big lineup to a smaller,
quicker one.
</P>
<P>
   Desmond Allison, a 6-5 freshman from Tampa, Fla., was inserted
at the shooting guard, allowing Heshimu Evans to move back to small
forward, which is his more comfortable position, with Padgett (6-9)
and Michael Bradley (6-10) underneath. Senior Wayne Turner
continues to run the show from the point.
</P>
<P>
   It appears to be working.
</P>
<P>
   Since the loss to Tennessee, Kentucky has beaten Ole Miss on the
road, handed No. 6 Auburn its only defeat of the season (72-62) and
destroyed Mississippi State (76-49).
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has had some growing pains, but now I think we're
starting to grow together,'' Smith said. ``If we keep it up, I
think we have a chance to be pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith confesses that returning to Athens, where he took the
Bulldogs to two NCAA Tournaments, is never easy. Son G.G., who was
a freshman point guard on his first Georgia team in the fall of
1995, is a senior now. Donna Smith will be there, as emotionally
torn as a mother and wife can be about a basketball game. Ron
Jirsa, Smith's friend and former assistant, is struggling in his
second season as the Georgia coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to do well and play well and win the game,'' Tubby
Smith said. ``But you care so much about the people there.''
</P>
<P>
   Those feelings, however, will disappear at the opening tip.
Smith has nine regular-season games left to round this work in
progess into a team capable of making a serious run at another
national championship. That's the goal at Kentucky. And it never
changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell our guys that they can't think about yesterday and they
can't worry about tomorrow,'' Smith said. ``The only thing we
control in our lives is today. And today, we have to dedicate
ourselves to getting just a little bit better. It's my job to make
sure we do that.''

 &HT;    IOC's ethics questioned by drug policy director
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   White House Drug Policy Director Barry McCaffrey questioned
Monday whether IOC members have the ethical position to deal with
the reform of drug policies in sport, after the bribery allegations
surrounding the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Games and the 2000
Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey, who will head the U.S. delegation to a world
conference on doping called by the IOC, acknowledged that the
situation has given him pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm puzzling through how to handle this situation right now,''
he said. ``I can't believe we can successfully face this (doping)
issue unless we have some institutional reforms in the IOC. So
that's a larger issue. But I don't see how we can move forward to
protect the athlete's level playing field unless the IOC is a
responsive institution with a set of standards and an outside
notion of democratic reforms and a code of conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   In the gravest scandal in its 105-year history, IOC leadership
over the weekend called for the expulsion of six members for
improperly accepting nearly $800,000 in payments from bidding
cities. Another three members remain under investigation, and three
others have resigned in the past week rather than face expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   The other scandal facing the IOC is that of
performance-enhancing drugs, which threatens the feel-good myth of
the Games and potentially turning off the Coca-Cola's and other
corporate sponsors who pay upwards of $100 million to be identified
with the Olympics. In the past, the IOC has been accused of talking
a good game on doping controls but falling short on funding and
enforcement. The IOC allegedly has concealed, for image purposes,
the number of athletes who have tested positive at Games.
</P>
<P>
   At its meetings in Lausanne, Switzerland, the IOC is expected to
accept a uniform drug policy for all international sports and the
establishment of an international drug-testing agency. McCaffrey
previously offered $1 million from the U.S. for drug research.
</P>
<P>
   The bribery scandal is ``a painful situation,'' McCaffrey said.
``I've watched with enormous dismay the loss of legitimacy of the
IOC over this issue. I really believe it's outrageous that
collectively they failed to recognize they have a trust, not a
tenure. The global community must have that corrected. And I'm not
sure that they are capable of correcting it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be open books and open votes. We probably need
to examine the requirement for new leadership to take us into the
next era.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal drug czar stopped just short of calling for the
ouster of IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, who appointed most
of the members caught up in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say he must accept responsibility for these absolutely
terrible lapses in ethical climate, which have jeopardized the
Olympic movement, along with other members of the IOC,'' McCaffrey
said. ``I would suggest there has to be a notion of democracy and
openess so that whether it national Olympic committees or the
sports federations , that there's some sense of responsibility to a
board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``And by the way, (the U.S. and other participating nations are)
not without power in this relationship,'' he said. ``The money is
flowing, (and) they're going to have to correspond to international
codes of conduct. The whole notion of bribery, of systematic
corruption, the notion they can hold their deliberations closed, is
simply nonsense.'''

 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODUJEVO, Yugoslavia _ Milos Savic, one of the few Serbs left in
this northern Kosovo town, says he has lost almost 40 pounds, but
he does not recommend the diet.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, he said, masked fighters of the ethnic Albanian
rebel group, the Kosovo Liberation Army, stopped him at a makeshift
roadblock and dragged him out of his car at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   They ordered him to put his hands on his head, took his
identification papers and searched his car for weapons. After more
than an hour of interrogation, they let him go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't afraid then,'' Savic said over too many cigarettes
and glasses of plum brandy. ``There wasn't time. But afterward I
started to shake. They could have kept me, kidnapped me like other
Serbs. From that moment to this I've lost more than 17 kilos,'' or
37 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Just Friday, he said, five elderly Serbs were taken by the
rebels from a village called Nevoljane, near Vucitrn.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when they are released,'' he said, as they were later
Sunday evening after negotiations with international monitors,
``they will go back to their village and talk to other Serbs, and
it will cause a panic among them _ among everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Savic sat in the little cafe he owns, the Milosev Inn. It is
named after the Serbian hero who killed the Ottoman Sultan Murad I
in the battle of Kosovo Polje in 1389. That was the famous defeat
at the hands of the Turks from which the Serbs have built their
national consciousness and claim to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Serbs here, just five miles from the provincial border
with the rest of Serbia, feel they are being driven out of Kosovo,
where ethnic Albanian rebels are seeking independence. And they
feel that their president, Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, for
all the West reviles him, has been able to protect Kosovo's Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Savic closes at 5 p.m. now, not at 11, because Serbs do not
venture out at night, and he points to the shrapnel holes in the
window glass from a nighttime grenade a year ago. He could not
afford to replace all of the glass, he said, and wonders how much
longer he will be able to stay in business.
</P>
<P>
   No ethnic Albanian will set foot inside this cafe now, for fear
of criticism from neighbors, and many Serbs are afraid to spend too
much time in a place that has already been a target.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it goes on like this,'' Savic said, ``if we have to keep
living in this kind of psychosis all the time, I don't know how I
can do this to my children.'' His wife, a schoolteacher, and their
two teen-agers have been living with relatives near Belgrade, the
Serbian and Yugoslav capital, for more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   Behind him, three Serbs played cards over drinks, smokes and
coffee. They huddled near the stove and talked, carefully at first,
to a stranger, and were reluctant to give their surnames. ``It's an
Albanian game,'' Milovan Ivanovic said, shrugging. ``You grow up
with it here.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the current situation, he said, ``How can it be good
when I was born here and I can't go out on the streets at night?''
</P>
<P>
   A player named Zelijko tossed down some cards with disgust.
``Now, in Serbian towns at 9 or 10 in the evening, you can only
find dogs in the streets,'' he said. ``Even the Albanians stay
inside _ they don't want to be mistaken for Serbs!''
</P>
<P>
   Often now, one can hear gunshots being fired from the villages
above the town, said Savic. ``Who knows what will happen?'' he
said. ``All of us feel the same, really. It's the only topic in the
restaurant, or with your wife, family or friends.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The population of Podujevo is roughly 130,000, with fewer than
1,000 Serbs, and many of them have sent their wives and children
away for the winter, to see how this intensifying struggle with the
Kosovo Liberation Army will turn out. Before the fighting
intensified last year, Serbs made up 10 percent of Kosovo's
population.
</P>
<P>
   But 25 years ago, the population of Podujevo was half Serb,
marking just how much the agitation of the ethnic Albanians for
self-rule has intensified since student riots in Pristina in 1981,
not long after Tito died and Yugoslavia began to disintegrate. The
country, which once had six republics, now consists of only Serbia
and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course they want to push us out of here, and the situation
makes you want to leave,'' said Slobodan, 41, a leather cap on his
head, some teeth missing from his smile and anchors tatooed on his
forearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is our state, and our police and army should operate
on the whole territory,'' he said. ``I've heard about what they
call this massacre at Racak'' _ the village where 45 ethnic
Albanian civilians were killed this month. ``But we have a legal
police and army and the Albanians don't,'' he said. ``And our guys
should have the right to shoot back.''
</P>
<P>
   In Podujevo, despite the imbalance in population, the city
government is run by Serbs. But even in the local municipal
building, most of the 40 Serbian women who used to work there have
left the city. Now there are ``maybe three,'' Savic said.
</P>
<P>
   Four months ago, when the Americans engineered an edgy and
deteriorating cease-fire for Kosovo and unarmed international
monitors began to arrive, some Albanian police officers worked
alongside the Serbs here. Now, pressured by the rebels and their
neighbors to choose sides, the Albanian policemen have resigned,
Savic said.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the villages now, Serbs and Albanians who used to watch
over each others' cattle are pressed by both sides to separate, and
more and more Serbs are leaving the villages, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1981, my life has been taken away from me bit by bit,''
said Savic.
</P>
<P>
   ``But could I live in a Kosovo outside of Serbia? No, I don't
think so. I will never leave this part of Yugoslavia,'' he said
with bravado, twisting his hands around another glass and fishing
for another cigarette. ``I was born here and I want to live in this
Yugoslavia, this Serbia, and no other country.''

 &HT;    First seven potential to be interviewed today in Texas dragging
death trial
 &HT;    By Zach Maxwell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER _ The first seven of more than 100 potential jurors in
the capital murder trial of John William King will be interviewed
today by attorneys in the case of the 24-year-old who stands
accused of dragging James Byrd Jr. to his death last year.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Guy James Gray and King's defense team of C.
Hayden ``Sonny'' Cribbs and Brack Jones whittled 11 people _
including a 62-year-old woman who brought a gun to the Jasper
County Courthouse _ from an original list of 133 potential jurors.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Joe Bob Golden issued more than 200
summonses, and case officials blamed fear of the trial's spotlight
and a foggy East Texas morning for the low jury pool turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have liked to have had 150,'' Gray said. ``The nature
of the case'' scared some people away, he said.
</P>
<P>
   An unidentified woman was arrested after a search of her purse
turned up a small revolver, according to Jasper Police Chief
Stanley Christopher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not believe the lady intentionally brought the weapon to
harm anyone,'' he said. ``But we will not tolerate it.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman was charged with unlawfully carrying a weapon and
later was released on $5,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
   A contingent of about 30 officers from local, state and federal
agencies watched over the courthouse and patrolled downtown streets
on foot, according to Jasper County Constable Ralph Nichols.
Bomb-sniffing dogs were brought in from Fort Polk, La., in a
precautionary sweep of the 110-year-old building early Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The mood during opening procedures and remarks was much more
calm, with King sitting in thought through most of the 3 1/2 hours
of Monday's events, wearing a blue and white button-down shirt,
khaki pants and black loafers. He also sported a stun belt, with
Jasper County Sheriff Billy Rowles and a jailer ready to give him
eight-second, 50,000-volt shocks if they deemed it necessary.
</P>
<P>
   King faces life in prison or the death penalty for his part in
what officials say was a racially-motivated hate crime. Byrd, 49,
was dragged behind a truck three miles down a rural county road on
June 7, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Allen Berry and Lawrence Russell Brewer also face capital
murder charges, with their trials stacked up behind King's and
possibly other un-related capital murders on the Jasper County
docket. The trio faces capital murder charges because prosecutors
allege the killing occurred during the commission of another crime:
kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Before noon, the juror list in King's trial was down to 122,
including 21 blacks. Four women and three men were scheduled to be
questioned by attorneys on both sides as selection of 12 jurors and
two alternates entered a second day. Both sides expected the
process to last two or more weeks, but Gray estimated the actual
trial would last six to eight days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury selection will probably last longer than the actual
case,'' he said in court.
</P>
<P>
   Gray offered a horrific glimpse into the crime, how Byrd was
alive and conscious at the time the dragging began, using his
elbows and arms ``in whatever way he could to keep his head and
shoulders from the pavement.'' A handful of jurors closed their
eyes at the image.
</P>
<P>
   The fatal blow, Gray said, came when the truck entered the
blacktop portion of Huff Creek Road and slung Byrd's body into a
concrete culvert, ripping apart his head and shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Gray told possible jurors, the black man's body was
dumped at a black cemetery ``as some form of message.''
</P>
<P>
   One woman expressed concern that her visit to the crime scene
would disqualify her, but Gray said that may not be automatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are a lot of people that have driven out there
and looked down that road,'' he said.

BUSH BEGINS `PROCESS OF PUTTING AN END TO SOCIAL PROMOTION' 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL VALLE, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush launched his campaign
Monday to end social promotion in Texas schools, saying his
proposal offers ``one of the most far-reaching pieces of
educational reform the state has ever passed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to begin the process of putting an end to social
promotion in Texas schools,'' Bush said at a press conference at
Hillcrest Elementary School in this town outside Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Touting the $200 million that Bush said his budget will set
aside for intensive reading instruction and training for teachers,
the governor said: ``Our state is a state that says we're not going
to leave anybody behind.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill, filed Monday as Senate Bill 1 by state Sen. Teel
Bivins, the Amarillo Republican who chairs the Senate education
committee, would require students in the third, fifth and eighth
grades to pass Texas Assessment of Academic Skills tests before
advancing to the next grade.
</P>
<P>
   It would give students three chances at each grade level to pass
the tests and calls for intensive remedial instruction before a
student is held back. It also establishes an appeals process for
parents who think their children ought to be moved ahead anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would not result in masses of Texas schoolchildren
being flunked at the end of this school year because it would be
phased in over several years.
</P>
<P>
   It would affect only those entering kindergarten in fall 1999 or
later. Next year's kindergartners would not face their first TAAS
test until 2003, when they are in the third grade _ after Bush has
left office. By then, Bush said, he hopes the state's new emphasis
on reading, along with state-funded intervention programs, such as
after-school reading programs, will have caught and corrected those
with reading problems.
</P>
<P>
   Last school year, some 42,000 Texas third-graders failed the
TAAS reading test and 38,000 of those were moved on to fourth
grade, Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would give schoolchildren three chances to pass
the TAAS test, with mandatory, intensive remedial instruction _
paid by the state _ provided after the exam is given.
</P>
<P>
   In the year 2005, fifth-graders would face flunking if they
cannot pass TAAS reading and math tests, and in 2008,
eighth-graders' promotion to high school would be tied to passing
tests in reading, writing and math. Remedial instruction also would
be mandated at those grade levels for those who fail the tests.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also establishes an appeals process for parents who
want to challenge their children's retention on the basis of test
results.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins, who authored the bill, said the appeals process is a
``pressure relief valve'' to address special situations. It calls
for schools to set up committees to decide whether a student should
be promoted after failing several times despite remedial help.
</P>
<P>
   The bill doesn't say what standards the local committee would
consider, but a decision to promote a kid who has repeatedly failed
the test would have to be unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Texans ``must have some good faith that local people
will make the right decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill requires schools to report how many students have been
promoted despite failing the TAAS test. That information would
figure into each school's rating with the state; in other words,
campuses promoting too many kids on appeal could wind up with a
lower rating.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins believes that system will be ``a powerful motivator.''

AMERICANS REMAIN CONSTANT IN THEIR VIEWS ON CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Miss., Fla., Ky., Texas, N.C.)  (See related stories: IMPEACH-RDP, IMPEACH-TRIAL, IMPEACH-SCENE,
IMPEACH-CONVICT)

 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most Americans, poll takers say, made up their minds the better
part of six months ago about whether President Clinton should
resign or be removed from office because of his involvement with
Monica Lewinsky. Nothing they have heard or seen since _ especially
the current congressional impeachment and trial proceedings _ has
caused significant change in their thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, roughly 60 percent of all Americans said the
president should neither resign nor be removed from office, while
about 35 percent favored resignation or removal, and the remaining
5 percent or so said they were not sure what to think. That is
still the case.
</P>
<P>
   Since the president's State of the Union address and after a
week of Senate trial proceedings, a half-dozen polls contain
essentially the same 60-35-5 breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with several dozen people around the country help
explain this numerical consistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the facts that are out are the only ones there are,
I don't see that I would change my mind,'' said Martha Campbell, a
retired teacher from Tempe, Ariz. ``And I don't think any more
facts will come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Campbell, a 67-year-old Democrat, says she has felt the
president should stay in office ever since the independent counsel,
Kenneth Starr, sent his voluminous report on Clinton and Ms.
Lewinsky to the House on Sept. 9. The report, which was made public
by the House, detailed Clinton's relationship with the former White
House intern and his alleged perjury and obstruction of justice in
trying to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   In the timing of Ms. Campbell's decision, she is typical of a
majority of Americans, poll takers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The release of the Starr report marked a turning point in
Clinton-Lewinsky for most Americans,'' said one of the nation's
most respected public opinion experts, Frank Newport of the Gallup
Poll. ``Well before that, the public had very quickly honed in on
what they thought had happened: marital infidelity, sex. They
didn't believe the president's explanation. But they mostly waited
until the Starr report was out before they made a final judgment on
how he had handled things. And basically, they have changed very
little ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   That is true of Pheda Fischer, a 74-year-old retired nurse from
Waveland, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   She is the obverse of Ms. Campbell when it comes to Clinton's
remaining in office _ Ms. Fischer is among the one-third of all
Americans who think he should resign or be removed from office. But
like Ms. Campbell, Ms. Fischer made her decision last summer and
has heard nothing since from the House and Senate proceedings, or
from anywhere else, that would change her mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has wronged America and women,'' she said. ``I don't
understand why the women's organizations don't get upset. Don't
they have any morality? I still want him gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Lightbourne, a 37-year-old schoolteacher from Shalimar,
Fla., also took a position on the president's conduct months ago,
giving careful weight to the sex factor, and she has stuck with her
judgment in the absence of any new evidence that moves her.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lightbourne says Clinton's conduct deeply disturbs her. But
she is willing to cut him some slack because she sees his problems
as stemming mainly from sexual indiscretion and from ``people just
wanting to dig through this over and over again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What the president did was morally wrong, but I don't think it
justifies removing him from office,'' said Ms. Lightbourne, who
usually votes Republican. ``He should be censured. There have been
other presidents who have had extramarital affairs. This has been a
witch hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Tubbs, a factory worker from Paris, Ky., holds a similar
view. He, too, concluded shortly after the Starr report was
released that Clinton should remain in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should leave him alone,'' said Tubbs, a Democrat. ``What
he did was something between him and his wife. His morals might not
be as high as mine and yours, but it's a private matter and it
should stay private.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The polls last week found an increase in the president's already
high job approval rating. In some polls it was over 70 percent,
possibly because his State of the Union Message was so well
received and the Senate trial has yet to produce any fresh, damning
information.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's rating as a moral leader remained near rock
bottom, a paradoxical gap that has been present almost since the
the Lewinsky matter broke into the news a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was the ``morality thing'' that eventually persuaded Georgia
Harris, an artist from Conroe, Texas, that the president had to go.
</P>
<P>
   For many months Ms. Harris, a 60-year-old Republican, believed
that the president was as ``guilty as sin,'' but that it would be
too disruptive to the nation for him to be removed from office.
Then came the debate in the House and its subsequent vote on Dec.
19 to impeach Clinton, and she became one of those relatively few
Americans who changed their minds about him well after the release
of the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point I decided we needed to make a clean slate,'' Ms.
Harris said. ``Now it would be better for the country to kick him
out. He is lacking in moral character. He is lacking in
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The rarest of all Americans when it comes to passing judgment on
the president are those few _ 5 percent or less _ who have not yet
made up their minds. Glenn Stancil, a farmer from Wilson, N.C., is
one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have different moods about him,'' said Stancil, 74, an
independent. ``Sometimes I think it would be better to get rid of
him. Then I think: `You're being too hard on him. Keep him. But put
some strings on him.'''
</P>
<P>
   Stancil attributed some of his vacillation to being
uncomfortable with criticism of people. Then he added: ``But he has
done a lot of damage to the country. Nice-looking fellow. Good
talker, I'll give him that.''

ALBRIGHT AND PRIMAKOV MEET, DISCUSS ECONOMY AND U.S.-RUSSIA
RELATIONS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Yevgeny Primakov and Madeleine Albright sat down to
dinner Monday night, nearly the 20th occasion that they have done
so during the maturing of the relationship between a former
university professor and a former spymaster.
</P>
<P>
   The American secretary of state and Russian prime minister
talked for three hours in an intimate wood-paneled dining room in
the White House _ the government building here. They drank toasts,
and when the subject turned to extremism in Russian politics, a
troupe of two guitarists and a singer slipped in to enliven things.
</P>
<P>
   One of the starkest points of the evening, as described by an
American who took part, was Primakov's description of his recent
trip to Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister talked of seeing bankrupt state enterprises
and the disastrous results of failed communist policies of the
past. He made the implicit case, the participant said, that the
United States should not abandon him, because he is the best man to
deal with the problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message was, `I have a big cleanup job and I'm doing the
best I can,''' said the American official.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov was striking at the core of the problem that now
worries the United States about Russia. Of uppermost concern, is a
collapse of central power in Russia, a collapse that some in the
Clinton administration say appears to be happening even faster than
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   A weakened Russia could threaten the United States in many ways
_ including, officials say, increased leaks of nuclear materials, a
turn toward authoritarianism and an inability to control uprisings.
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk of a certain chemistry between Albright, 61,
the former university professor, and Primakov, 69, the former
director of the foreign intelligence service that replaced the KGB,
there were two increasingly different views of the world at the
table Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Albright has reportedly described Primakov to colleagues this
way: ``He is what he was.''
</P>
<P>
   By this she apparently meant that Primakov's formative
experiences as a Tass correspondent in the Middle East during the
height of the Cold War and his maneuvering and rise to the top of
the Kremlin bureaucracy until the end of Communism left an
indelible mark on him. He continues to be suspicious of the
intentions of the United States and wants to promote as much as
possible the power of his country, which is now much smaller than
it was.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, who was elevated from foreign minister last year, has
repeatedly said in the last few months what he reportedly said
Monday night: that the United States should back him because the
alternatives are only worse. In delivering this message he has also
unmistakably telegraphed his resentment of American dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Primakov is not working to diminish American influence per
se,'' said a Russian foreign ministry official. ``But he is
resentful of the American arrogance as it makes its foreign
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, a central theme of Primakov's foreign policy at a time of
such dramatic Russian decline is to stress the need for a
multi-polar world. ``He argues that the United States cannot act
just as it sees fit,'' said the foreign ministry official. ``He
sees the only way of maintaining Russian interests is to have
strong international checks and balances at a time of Russian
weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with several American journalists last summer
while he was still foreign minister, Primakov said he was miffed at
what he saw as unfair portrayals of him in the American press that
stressed his former position as the head of the intelligence
service. He was able to name American columnists whom he favored
and those he did not. He showed an ample knowledge of what was in
the American press.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not because I want your audience to like me,'' he said at
that time, as he gave sound bites on the essence of his foreign
policy. ``I believe it's possible to combine a number of things.
One, protect the national interests of Russia. Two, do it without
slipping toward confrontation. Three, to develop relations with
every country.''
</P>
<P>
   The sense of despair in Moscow about Russia's tumbling stature
and economic disarray has transformed itself into explicit
expressions of bitterness toward the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in an interview on Russian television Monday night,
the last reform prime minister, Sergei Kiriyenko, who was thrown
out of office by President Boris Yeltsin last August, made some
unusually harsh comments about Washington. Kiriyenko, who was a
favorite leader of the Clinton administration, said that the United
States should help the Russians develop their nuclear technology so
that Russia could market peaceful technology for profit.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Kiriyenko asserted, the United States was asking the
Russians to curb their nuclear technology and was offering food aid
in return. In such a situation, the food would be good for
``tomorrow,'' Kiriyenko said, but Russia would lose its valuable
technology forever.
</P>
<P>
   In her most strident meeting on Monday, Albright met with the
communist speaker of the Parliament, Genadi Seleznev, who asked
pointed questions about why the United States had decided to plan a
limited missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview earlier with reporters, Seleznev said that he
believed that the announcement of the new missile defense system
would ``postpone'' the ratification of Start II, the treaty that
calls for the reduction in nuclear weapons by both the United
States and Russia.

 &HT;    Mathis comes clean about sobriety
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ At times the past few years, Terance Mathis was as out
of control as the car he recklessly drove on Georgia 400 at 110
mph. On occasions, the Atlanta Falcons wide receiver would check
into a hotel because he was too impaired to make it home.
</P>
<P>
   Some nights, he would despair over his personal and professional
plight. Most times, Mathis stared into the bathroom mirror and
hated the stranger looking back at him.
</P>
<P>
   So, on the world's biggest sports stage Monday, Mathis chose the
Super Bowl forum to bring the darkest secret of his private life
into the glare of the media spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-year veteran, who last week first told ESPN reporter
Chris Mortensen of his one-time alcohol dependency, spent the first
day of Super Bowl preparations detailing his battle to find
sobriety and inner peace. The motivation for his timing, Mathis
said during a lengthy interview in which he alternately was
emotional and dispassionate, was equal parts a catharsis and an
effort to clear his conscience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the reaction will be worse in this setting than if I
had done it somewhere else and it just got lost in the shuffle of
things,'' Mathis said. ``At the Super Bowl, the whole world is
watching everything you do. It's all magnified, and that's fine
with me. It was time to come clean, and hopefully doing so will
allow me to help other people with the same problem I experienced.
I figure there's someone out there who can relate, who I can help.
But there was a time (that) I was scared that my (drinking) would
hurt somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   But the wounds inflicted by Mathis' drinking were
self-inflicted.
</P>
<P>
   One of Atlanta's most respected and socially conscious
professional athletes, Mathis said he looked at the world through a
bottle for several years before seeking help last season. At that
point, he acknowledged, his alcoholism forced him into deep
depression, and he feared he would hurt someone else while driving
home drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1997 that he
nearly retired before that season and said the possibility he would
prematurely end his career was a result of his drinking. He kept
playing, and his worst incidents were minor ones: He was roused
from near sleep at the wheel when he hit a bump on Georgia 400; he
once woke up in the parking lot of a motel; he was stopped for
speeding on one occasion but avoided a Breathalyzer test.
</P>
<P>
   So heavy was his drinking at times, though, that the potential
for disaster was never much more than a shot and a beer from
reality.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis insisted Monday that he does not consider himself an
alcoholic _ ``At least not anymore,'' he said _ but said there were
days he could consume just about anything the bartender put in
front of him. It was a stark description by a player whose T.L.C.
foundation, Terance Loves Children, has provided food, clothing and
shelter for disadvantaged kids in Albuquerque, N.M., Atlanta and
Detroit and who distributes Thanksgiving turkeys to the needy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's how it was not too long ago,'' Mathis said. ``I would
get up and eat breakfast and by noon have a couple beers. Then in
the afternoon, I'd have a few more beers. If those didn't get me
(numbed), I'd switch to the hard stuff at night. You name it, Crown
Royal, a couple shots of tequila. Whatever got me to that point
where I felt I had to be. That's all I wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been times since coming to Atlanta in 1994 as an
unrestricted free agent that the personable Mathis sat in front of
his locker stall in Suwanee, Ga., and sulked. He confided in no
one.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis declined to say when his drinking moved beyond the social
stage. But its roots, he said, probably can be traced to insecurity
and his own perception that his accomplishments were not
appreciated by the Falcons, the media and his peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're only human, you know?'' he said. ``I caught 111 passes
in 1994 and went to a Pro Bowl game. But then we changed coaches
and offenses, and suddenly I'm reading and I'm hearing that maybe
I'm not the right kind of receiver for what Dan Reeves wants to do.
And so you think to yourself, 'Why am I even playing this game, if
no one even respects what I've achieved?'
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably got to its worst last season. When I was late for
a team meeting, I knew I wasn't being me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathis sought help from his wife, his mother, Reeves and a
doctor. Rather than enter a treatment program, he asked the doctor
to give him two weeks to turn himself around. He never called the
doctor back. Stopping cold turkey, Mathis said, probably was the
toughest thing he has experienced. He doesn't recommend it to
anyone, and he probably made it through the Mathis Method only
because of the discipline of his football background.
</P>
<P>
   The irony in using a Super Bowl to focus more attention on the
need for people with a similar problem to seek help is that Mathis
was afraid that if he entered a treatment center the media would
have found out.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then,'' he said, ``everyone would know I let them down. My
wife. My kids. My mother. My grandparents. My friends and my
teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathis, who grew up in Stone Mountain, Ga., often visited area
schools the past five seasons to deliver anti-drug lectures. Two
years ago, he was asked by the White House to travel to Scott
Branch High School in Summerton, S.C., to counsel the students
there. At times, he felt a twinge of hypocrisy in front of the
students, Mathis admitted. ``I couldn't even heed my own message,''
he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, though, the message got through.
</P>
<P>
   While specialists might disagree with Mathis' contention he can
still drink a beer or two in a social setting and know when to
stop, he said he is cured of a weakness that nearly ate him up.
Losing the extra weight from the alcohol helped him enjoy a
standout season. And losing the craving for booze is helping him
enjoy life again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I'd look into the mirror and I'd see this fat, ugly
guy who was mean-spirited and looked mad at the world,'' Mathis
said. ``I always had a scowl on my face. Now I look in the mirror,
and it's back to being Terance. That guy in the mirror, his smile
is back.''

 &HT;    First seven potential jurors to be interviewed today in Texas
dragging death trial
 &HT;    By Zach Maxwell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER _ The first seven of more than 100 potential jurors in
the capital murder trial of John William King will be interviewed
today by attorneys in the case of the 24-year-old who stands
accused of dragging James Byrd Jr. to his death last year.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Guy James Gray and King's defense team of C.
Hayden ``Sonny'' Cribbs and Brack Jones whittled 11 people _
including a 62-year-old woman who brought a gun to the Jasper
County Courthouse _ from an original list of 133 potential jurors.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Joe Bob Golden issued more than 200
summonses, and case officials blamed fear of the trial's spotlight
and a foggy East Texas morning for the low jury pool turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have liked to have had 150,'' Gray said. ``The nature
of the case'' scared some people away, he said.
</P>
<P>
   An unidentified woman was arrested after a search of her purse
turned up a small revolver, according to Jasper Police Chief
Stanley Christopher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not believe the lady intentionally brought the weapon to
harm anyone,'' he said. ``But we will not tolerate it.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman was charged with unlawfully carrying a weapon and
later was released on $5,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
   A contingent of about 30 officers from local, state and federal
agencies watched over the courthouse and patrolled downtown streets
on foot, according to Jasper County Constable Ralph Nichols.
Bomb-sniffing dogs were brought in from Fort Polk, La., in a
precautionary sweep of the 110-year-old building early Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The mood during opening procedures and remarks was much more
calm, with King sitting in thought through most of the 3 1/2 hours
of Monday's events, wearing a blue and white button-down shirt,
khaki pants and black loafers. He also sported a stun belt, with
Jasper County Sheriff Billy Rowles and a jailer ready to give him
eight-second, 50,000-volt shocks if they deemed it necessary.
</P>
<P>
   King faces life in prison or the death penalty for his part in
what officials say was a racially-motivated hate crime. Byrd, 49,
was dragged behind a truck three miles down a rural county road on
June 7, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Allen Berry and Lawrence Russell Brewer also face capital
murder charges, with their trials stacked up behind King's and
possibly other un-related capital murders on the Jasper County
docket. The trio faces capital murder charges because prosecutors
allege the killing occurred during the commission of another crime:
kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Before noon, the juror list in King's trial was down to 122,
including 21 blacks. Four women and three men were scheduled to be
questioned by attorneys on both sides as selection of 12 jurors and
two alternates entered a second day. Both sides expected the
process to last two or more weeks, but Gray estimated the actual
trial would last six to eight days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury selection will probably last longer than the actual
case,'' he said in court.
</P>
<P>
   Gray offered a horrific glimpse into the crime, how Byrd was
alive and conscious at the time the dragging began, using his
elbows and arms ``in whatever way he could to keep his head and
shoulders from the pavement.'' A handful of jurors closed their
eyes at the image.
</P>
<P>
   The fatal blow, Gray said, came when the truck entered the
blacktop portion of Huff Creek Road and slung Byrd's body into a
concrete culvert, ripping apart his head and shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Gray told possible jurors, the black man's body was
dumped at a black cemetery ``as some form of message.''
</P>
<P>
   One woman expressed concern that her visit to the crime scene
would disqualify her, but Gray said that may not be automatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are a lot of people that have driven out there
and looked down that road,'' he said.

 &HT;    Atlanta claims no wrongdoing in its Olympics bidding
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Even as other host committees conceded wrongdoing and
acknowledged destroying records, Atlanta Olympic officials
reiterated Monday that their bidding effort was clean and began
preparing a response to an IOC inquiry into their bid.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Olympic chief Billy Payne said he has not received an
official inquiry but welcomes an investigation into improper
activities on the part of IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we've said for the last five weeks, our successful bid was
predicated on the hard work of small group of individuals who were
then and remain now deeply committed to Olympic movement,'' said
Payne. ``We believe our response will indicate a city can play
within the rules and be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, after expelling six
members this weekend, said the organization would broaden its
investigation to examine allegations of misconduct in other bids,
stretching from the Games of 1996 to 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Payne and several of original volunteer bid group members have
conferred and plan to respond by Sunday, the deadline set forth in
a draft letter to all Olympic bidders.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether the IOC or the U.S. Olympic Committee
would pursue the investigation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Lausanne over the weekend, IOC vice president Dick Pound,
chairman of the special commission investigating influence
peddling, said he would ask the USOC for any proof that IOC members
received inappropriate gifts, favors or compensation in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But USOC spokesman Mike Moran said his organization was not
pursuing an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Moran said he thinks that Pound will send a letter directly to
Payne seeking information about the IOC's conduct during the bid.
``Any information that may come our way will go to the Mitchell
Commission,'' Moran said.
</P>
<P>
   He referred to a special commission headed by former U.S. Sen.
George Mitchell that already is reviewing the Salt Lake City bid
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ACOG spokesman Dick Yarbrough said Monday that a copy of Payne's
response would go to both. ``It doesn't matter, to the extent that
the answers are the answers. We know what the questions are,''
Yarbrough said. ``And they are pretty simple questions to answer in
Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the IOC is asking the bidders if any IOC members
engaged in unethical conduct while in their cities. It is seeking
evidence of any IOC members requesting or accepting money, goods or
services unrelated to the candidacy of a city, accepting material
benefits for relatives or accepting excessive hospitality, such as
multiple visits or bringing more than one person on visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already answered those questions,'' Payne said Monday.
``Our formal response will confirm what we have said to date. Our
answer will once again affirm that what we did was within the rules
that were promulgated and customs that were allowed and the
financial support that was permitted.''
</P>
<P>
   Other cities already are responding to the inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, Nagano Mayor Tasuku Tsukada acknowledged that the
city's successful bidders for the 1998 Winter Games provided IOC
members all-expenses-paid trips to the ancient capital of Kyoto.
</P>
<P>
   The Nagano bidders also have said they burned expense records in
a city incinerator in 1992, less than a year after Nagano was
awarded the Games.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of Atlanta's bid documents are packed in hundreds
of boxes and stored at the Atlanta History Center, which is
building an archive that eventually will be open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   However, neither the History Center nor the Georgia Amateur
Athletics Foundation, which owns the documents, would allow
reporters to go through the records. Atlanta's bid documents and
financial data never have been made public.
</P>
<P>
   ACOG spokesman Bob Brennan and bid committee official Horace
Sibley, a lawyer with the firm of King and Spalding, are sorting
through the boxes of paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC is one of five bodies investigating the Salt Lake
scandals. Other inquiries _ some potentially more damaging _ are
being carried out by the Salt Lake ethics committee, the Justice
Department and the FBI, the U.S. Olympic Committee and the Utah
attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   In related developments on Monday, Andrew Young said he plans to
suggest to Mitchell that Salt Lake's offerings to IOC delegates
were ``not done in the sense of bribery.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Young said, they were ``done in terms of humanitarian
relief and (Mitchell) ought to consider that option.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sen. Mitchell is a wise and reasonable man,'' Young said. ``We
are living now in a time of . . . the extreme of the old Woodward
and Bernstein 'Let's bring everybody down.' I think Salt Lake put
together a very good bid and did a very good job and didn't need to
bribe anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``And yet they are the kind of people that would help, and might
easily get exploited by IOC members or by sports agents.'' Young
also expressed ``shock'' over charges leveled against him by
Australian Olympic chief John Coates, who suggested that Young
dispensed U.S. foreign aid in exchange for support for Atlanta's
bid for the 1996 Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not good losers,'' Young said. ``Whenever they lose
they think that somebody else has been dishonest.''
</P>
<P>
   Young also said that embattled IOC delegate Jean-Claude Ganga of
the Republic of Congo last week faxed copies of letters to him that
apparently serve as part of Ganga's own defense against IOC
corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
   Ganga allegedly accepted payments and gifts from Salt Lake
totalling $216,000, allegations he is contesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Ganga) sent me letters that he had received from other
African countries which served as receipts for the money that he
had given them,'' said Young, who values Ganga as a friend.

INTEL RETREATS ON CHIP CONTAINING AN ID CODE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Intel Corp. backed away on Monday from a plan to embed an
identifying signature in its next generation of computer chips,
bowing to protests that the technology would compromise the privacy
of users.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, which makes about 85 percent of the world's computer
processors, announced last week that each of its new Pentium III
chips would have an identifying serial number that would enhance
the security of electronic commerce and guard against software
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   But advocacy groups said they feared it would mark a further
erosion of anonymity on the Internet and would allow companies to
collect detailed profiles of consumers, which could then be resold.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Intel said it would modify the identification system
in the new chips so that it is automatically disabled unless the
computer user voluntarily turns it on. The company said it would
also offer free software to allow customers to turn off the feature
permanently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always understood that there are security questions that
get raised when someone is providing identification in a
transaction,'' Tom Waldrop, an Intel spokesman, said in explaining
the reversal. ``Whether an individual is showing a driver's license
of handing over a credit card number, it always raises a privacy
question. We have done things to address that. You have to weigh
the positive value of having more secured Internet transactions,
more secure electronic commerce, against any privacy concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy
Information Center, a privacy advocacy group in Washington, D.C.,
which had called for a boycott of the new chip, said, ``It looks
like we won Round 1.'' But he said much more needed to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a temporary fix, he said. ``It can be as easily disabled
as enabled. There's not enough assurance here that the chip will
not be misused.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel said it would continue to work with consumer groups to
allay fears about the new chip.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, the world's largest chipmaker, with $26.2 billion in
sales last year, said the chip signature was intended to promote
the growth of electronic commerce by giving companies a better way
to verify the identities of their customers. It said the feature
could also be used to avoid piracy by preventing a single copy of a
software program from being installed on several machines.
</P>
<P>
   But after Intel last week announced plans to include the
identification technology in its Pentium III chips, which are due
for release in a few months, a furor ensued.
</P>
<P>
   Junkbusters, a high-tech lobbying group based in Green Brook,
N.J., said in a statement on its Web site: ``Intel's proposal to
put a unique ID code inside of every computer it sells will
significantly reduce the level of privacy available to computer
users around the world. The unique code will make possible far more
extensive tracking and profiling of individual activity, without
either the knowledge or consent of the user.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Rep. Edward Markey, the senior Democrat on the House
consumer protection subcommittee, wrote a letter to Intel's chief
executive, Craig Barrett, asking that the company reconsider its
plans, ``to better balance both commercial and privacy
objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Markey said he understood the technology's implications for
online commerce, where the anonymity of the Internet can encourage
fraud. But he expressed concern that it would also help online
marketers surreptitiously track consumers on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel's new product improves technology for online commerce in
a way that compromises personal privacy,'' Markey wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The skirmish over the Pentium III is the latest front in the
struggle between security and privacy on the Internet. Earlier
rounds have focused on the use of an identifying mechanism called
``cookies,'' which enable Web sites to write information onto a
computer's hard drive that could serve to identify the computer
user on future visits. Many Web sites now require users to accept a
cookie as a condition of entry. But unlike cookies, which are
contained in a text file that can be altered or deleted by the
user, the Pentium III signature would be a part of the hardware.
</P>
<P>
   In its effort to reassure consumers, Intel said it would not
maintain a master database of consumer names matched to Pentium
serial numbers. The company said it would also encourage Web sites
and software programmers to warn consumers whenever the serial
number is retrieved.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the privacy debate has focused on how online
marketers and companies collect personal information, the new
technology also raises concerns about whether it could be used by
law enforcement officials and governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always thought that in this debate over authentication,
governments would like more rather than less,'' Rotenberg said.
``This is the flip side of anonymity, and governments are pushing
for authentication. So there are some real concerns about
government control.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute erupted at an awkward time for the Clinton
administration, which has for months been trying to convince the
European Union that American companies are doing enough to protect
consumer privacy on line.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the European Union enacted a tough privacy law that
prohibits companies doing business in its 15-member countries from
disclosing personal information about customers without their
consent. Rather than pass a law adopting the European Union
requirements, the Clinton administration has been pushing online
marketers and merchants to adopt self-regulatory models for
protecting consumers on line. But it has had a tough time selling
that approach as adequate to the European Union, although the union
has delayed sanctions against the United States while negotiations
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Clayton, counsel and senior privacy analyst for Stone
Investments, a technology investment firm based in Dallas, said
that while there are some legitimate privacy concerns with the new
technology, ``this is designed to actually protect people from
something privacy advocates have been talking about, which is theft
of personal information and fraud.''

   The IOC is one of five bodies investigating the Salt Lake
scandals. Other inquiries _ some potentially more damaging _ are
being carried out by the Salt Lake ethics committee, the Justice
Department and the FBI, the U.S. Olympic Committee and the Utah
attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   In related developments on Monday, Andrew Young said he plans to
suggest to Mitchell that Salt Lake's offerings to IOC delegates
were ``not done in the sense of bribery.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Young said, they were ``done in terms of humanitarian
relief and (Mitchell) ought to consider that option.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sen. Mitchell is a wise and reasonable man,'' Young said. ``We
are living now in a time of . . . the extreme of the old Woodward
and Bernstein 'Let's bring everybody down.' I think Salt Lake put
together a very good bid and did a very good job and didn't need to
bribe anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``And yet they are the kind of people that would help, and might
easily get exploited by IOC members or by sports agents.'' Young
also expressed ``shock'' over charges leveled against him by
Australian Olympic chief John Coates, who suggested that Young
dispensed U.S. foreign aid in exchange for support for Atlanta's
bid for the 1996 Games.

   ``People are not good losers,'' Young said. ``Whenever they lose
they think that somebody else has been dishonest.''

apparently serve as part of Ganga's own defense against IOC
corruption charges.

<P>
   Ganga allegedly accepted payments and gifts from Salt Lake
totalling $216,000, allegations he is contesting.

<P>
   ``(Ganga) sent me letters that he had received from other
African countries which served as receipts for the money that he
had given them,'' said Young, who values Ganga as a friend.

CLINTON SEEKS DISMISSAL OF CASE AS SENATE EXPLORES GRACEFUL EXITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton asked the Senate Monday to
dismiss impeachment charges, a request that the 100 senators then
debated in a rare closed-door session.
</P>
<P>
   Senators were expected to add House prosecutors' request for
witnesses to their deliberations on Tuesday. Votes on the motion to
dismiss and the question of witnesses were expected Tuesday or
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Seligman, one of Clinton's personal attorneys since 1994,
urged Senate dismissal of the impeachment case, saying: ``You have
listened; you have heard. The case cannot be made; it is time to
end it.''
</P>
<P>
   She spoke after Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., made the motion to
dismiss the case, arguing that there were not the 67 Senate votes
required to convict and remove Clinton from office on the
impeachment articles. Clinton was charged with perjury and
obstruction of justice stemming from his cover up of a sexual
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the folksy former Air Force lawyer
who has articulated the case against Clinton in everyday terms,
replied with a passionate appeal for the Senate to allow the trial
to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please don't dismiss this case, for the good of this country,
for the good of the law,'' Graham implored. ``Let us get to what
happened here.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham went beyond the dry legal issues raised by the articles
of impeachment and raised the question of Clinton's self-control.
</P>
<P>
   Graham noted that the chief executive had ventured into a series
of risky sexual escapades with Lewinsky in 1995 at about the same
time that lawyers for Paula Jones were looking for other Clinton
paramours who might be able to corroborate an alleged pattern of
sexual misconduct that would support Jones' civil suit allegations
that Clinton sexually harassed her when he was governor of
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to rebut defense claims that Clinton's personal
misconduct does not warrant removal from office, Graham declared:
``I think it matters a great deal if you're sued for sexually
harassing somebody, and they're on to the fact that you can't
control yourself enough to stop it four, five years after you're
sued, and you're doing it in the White House with somebody half
your age _ I think that would matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham added: ``Don't dismiss this case. Find out who our
president is.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee and the leader of the 13-member House prosecution team,
struck a defensive note as he appealed for the Senate to reject
proposed dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sort of feel that we have fallen short in the respect side
because of the fact that we represent the House, the other body,
kind of blue-collar people, and we're over here trying to survive
with our impeachment articles,'' Hyde said. ``Now a trial, as I
understand it, is a search for truth, and it should not be trumped
by a search for an exit strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's team wants the Senate to expand the scope of the trial to
include testimony from witnesses, such as Lewinsky, who met with
three House prosecutors on Sunday.

</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and other
Republican senators sent a letter to the White House asking Clinton
to respond to 10 questions. The letter asked Clinton to begin each
answer with a ``yes'' or a ``no,'' followed by an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   But White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton would not
answer the questions.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers' floor debate before the Senate paralleled more
private efforts by senators to come up with a bipartisan conclusion
to the Senate trial that entered a fourth week on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the proposals that were floated Monday was a plan by Sens.
Slade Gorton, R-Wash., and Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., to have
Democrats withdraw the motion to dismiss and Republicans withdraw
the motion for witnesses in return for an expedited up-or-down vote
on the two articles of impeachment for perjury and obstruction of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans rejected the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Another plan by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah, and Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, suggested having the
Senate vote a finding of facts on the two articles of impeachment
before addressing the question of conviction. That way, senators
could underscore that they believe Clinton broke the law, without
having to vote to remove him from office _ an outcome that would
require 67 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans and Senate Democrats crossed party lines to
reject, by a 57 to 43 vote, a bid by Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, to
have the Senate debate the dismissal motion in public. Most
Democrats were joined by Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, Arlen
Specter, R-Pa., and Susan Collins, R-Maine, to vote for an open
session. Most Republicans were joined by Byrd, Max Baucus, D-Mont.,
and Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., in voting to keep the session closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a private club,'' Harkin lamented afterward. ``The
taxpayers are paying for this. It's a holdover from the 19th
century. This is a throwback almost to the dark ages.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul David Wellstone, D-Minn., who supported Harkin's
effort, called the decision to uphold the closed-door rule ``a
terrible vote,'' adding: ``What ever happened to the tradition of
open-honest debate in the U.S. Senate. It goes against everything a
representative Democracy is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators who divulge the proceedings risk expulsion from the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have said if it's open, it would dissolve into partisan
warfare,'' Harkin said, adding: ``If words start leaking out, there
will be a witch hunt. We are on dangerous, dangerous ground.''

AIDS CONTROL SHOWN BY PATIENTS AFTER `COCKTAILS' HALTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Researchers have opened a daring new chapter in the fight
against AIDS by showing that some patients' immune systems can
control the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) after drugs are
withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Reports are emerging that a handful of patients around the world
have been able to suppress the virus for up to 21 months after
stopping potent triple-drug therapy. Experts think it shows that
very low levels of HIV can act like a vaccine that stimulates
effective natural immunity, perhaps indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   However, the experience of a 32-year-old Boston man _ the first
volunteer anywhere in high-profile experiments to stop taking
anti-HIV drugs deliberately _ is showing that scientists have a
long way to go before they can manage the trick reliably.
</P>
<P>
   John Ceravsky, the Boston patient, went off AIDS drugs on the
last day of July in an experiment at Massachusetts General Hospital
disclosed earlier that month. Potent anti-HIV drugs had reduced the
virus to undetectable levels for 17 months.
</P>
<P>
   Typically when HIV-infected patients stop taking their drug
``cocktails,'' ordinarily because of severe side effects, the virus
comes roaring back to pre-treatment levels within days or weeks. So
the MGH researchers were encouraged when Ceravsky's blood remained
virus-free, by the most sensitive tests, throughout most of August.
</P>
<P>
   But three weeks after stopping therapy, HIV gradually reemerged
in Ceravsky's bloodstream _ from 1,000 virus copies per deciliter
of blood to 2,000 copies a week later to 17,000 copies in the third
week.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bruce Walker and Dr. Eric Rosenberg, who are running the MGH
experiment, said they had expected Ceravsky's HIV might come back,
but had hoped his immune system would control it, since he was one
of two dozen MGH patients who began drug treatment within weeks of
becoming infected with HIV _ before the virus had crippled his
immune system. Still, they said Monday, they were heartened by the
fact that Ceravsky's virus crept back slowly, and did not spike to
his pretreatment levels of 280,000 viral copies.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a good sign, they said, that the reemergent virus
had not developed resistance to antiviral drugs. Thus it could be
quickly suppressed again to undetectable levels with a new round of
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, Ceravsky stopped taking medication once again.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg and Walker had been planning to withdraw the drugs
soon anyway, to see if the virus would come back a second time. But
their timetable for the second withdrawal was accelerated because
Ceravsky contracted hepatitis-A, a viral infection of the liver
that may have come from contaminated food. Since anti-HIV drugs can
also suppress liver function, it can be risky to give them when
patients have active hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
   Monday Rosenberg gave Ceravsky the unwelcome news that HIV has
begun to reappear in his bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   Ceravsky, a computer technician, took the news philosophically.
``If it keeps going up, it's back to the drug cocktails. You hope
it doesn't happen, but it's not necessarily bad news,'' he said.
``Eventually, I'd like to see my immune system completely wipe the
virus out. So far, my immune system is on my side, for the most
part.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker said the level of virus in Ceravsky's blood ``is still
small, around 1,000 copies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what this means,'' Walker said. ``We expected a
blip in his viral levels. The question is, how high will it go this
time and will it come back down?''
</P>
<P>
   The MGH researcher said other researchers reported at a recent
Colorado AIDS meeting that some patients who have stopped taking
drugs had viral levels spike at 30,000 copies before declining
again as their immune systems gained the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   The MGH researchers and other leading AIDS researchers remain
highly encouraged about the signs that some patients' immune
systems can fight back against HIV and win, even if they don't yet
know how to tilt the playing field so that it happens more
reliably.
</P>
<P>
   A second MGH patient will stop taking anti-HIV drugs this week,
and two more are scheduled to go off medication soon. Walker
cautioned HIV patients not to stop taking drugs on their own, since
the ones in his study are a carefully selected group who have firm
evidence of a strong and HIV-specific immune response before they
stop drugs _ and are monitored closely to determine if and when
they should resume.
</P>
<P>
   One 39-year-old German man, who has become known since last
summer as ``the Berlin patient,'' has so far gone 21 months without
antiviral drugs, with no evidence that HIV has reemerged. Unlike
Ceravsky, the Berlin man was part of no controlled experiment but
took himself off therapy twice because of the drugs' side effects.
However, scientists have monitored his experience closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have quite clear evidence with this patient that we
induced a very strong immune response with drug treatment,'' said
Dr. Franco Lori of the Research Institute for Genetic and Human
Therapy in Washington and Pavia, Italy. ``It's hard to get
cause-and-effect, but this case is very suggestive that the virus
is still there, yet the immune response is controlling it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lori said these and a few other such cases in New York and
Washington are leading some top AIDS researchers to shift their
sights away from eradication of HIV through drugs and toward the
possibility of long-term control. ``The concept of eradication, I
have to say, has been a loser,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if patients' immune systems cannot control HIV on their own
indefinitely, some researchers hope they will learn how to allow
patients to take drug ``holidays,'' perhaps lessening or avoiding
serious treatment side-effects such as diabetes and worrisome fat
deposits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly don't recommend withdrawing treatment for general
use. It may turn out to be a failure,'' said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci,
the federal government's leading AIDS researcher. ``But at least we
are taking the bold step of taking people off drugs. We'll learn
some important things in the next year.''

 &HT;    Delta strikes agreement to show CNN-produced inflight programs
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call it the creeping CNN-ization of air travel.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers at major airports already watch CNN's Airport Channel
while waiting for their flights. Soon, those flying on Delta Air
Lines will get another dose of CNN in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The two Atlanta-based companies today will announce a new deal
under which Turner Inflight Services will provide Delta's video
programming.
</P>
<P>
   The Turner Broadcasting System unit will produce a
magazine-style mix of news, sports and features exclusively for the
airline. It will be labeled ``Horizons'' and identified as a CNN
production.
</P>
<P>
   Delta spokesman Dan Lewis said starting next month Horizons will
replace the carrier's existing free inflight videos, which are
cobbled together from a variety of sources.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is ``a new look, a new feel and new programming''
aboard longer flights on which videos are shown, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Delta will continue to buy full-length movies
separately, although Lewis said the new deal could evolve to
include movies from Turner.
</P>
<P>
   On domestic flights, the 40-minute Horizons show will consist of
seven segments ranging from news clips from shows such as ``Larry
King Live'' or ``Moneyline'' to features on health, entertainment
and travel.
</P>
<P>
   The international version is 2 1/2 hours long _ with different
eastbound and westbound versions for trans-oceanic flights _ and
also will include sitcoms from Turner's storehouse.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the content will be recycled, some elements will
be original, Turner Inflight officials said. A segment called
``Toybox,'' for example, will feature high-tech gadgets. Delta will
get a fresh mix of programming from Turner Inflight every week.
</P>
<P>
   CNN personalities _ ``Moneyline ''anchor Lou Dobbs, for instance
_ will host certain segments. Bob Garner, director of Turner
Inflight Services, said the Delta deal marks the first time CNN has
allowed on-air talent to be used as hosts in such a production.
</P>
<P>
   He said using news anchors was a ``big issue'' but added Turner
is satisfied CNN's independence won't be compromised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delta has deliberately planned this so it is not perceived as
a corporate video,'' he said. Deborah Cooper, senior vice president
of Turner Private Networks division, said the partnership will
``absolutely not'' influence CNN's coverage of Delta and airline
issues in its regular news shows.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines last year announced a similar partnership with
CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Garner said Turner Inflight, which has previously supplied clips
to Delta and more than 100 other airlines, is part of Turner
Broadcasting's effort to generate revenue from its video
collection. Garner said the Delta partnership is the biggest deal
yet for the unit. Financial terms aren't being released. Lewis said
the deal ``ultimately will not end up costing us more'' because
Delta won't have to buy video from other sources and can eliminate
in-house editing.

 &HT;    Atlanta Gas Light Co. to issue refunds in rate settlement
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Public Service Commission scheduled a special meeting today
to ratify a settlement with Atlanta Gas Light Co. that the company
hopes will put to rest an uproar over its new rate system.
</P>
<P>
   Details were still being negotiated late Monday in advance of
the 5 p.m. meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Company spokesman Ross Willis said AGL expects to make refunds
to between 200,000 and 300,000 customers who ended up paying
exhorbitant rates when they used little or no gas during November
and December.
</P>
<P>
   ``The refunds will be directed to those that were hurt the
most,'' Willis said. Those who saw the largest impact were the
150,000 ``heat-only'' customers who use gas for winter heating, but
not for hot water heaters or other uses.
</P>
<P>
   Walter M. Higgins, chief executive of the utility, said AGL
would go back to charging customers on the basis of gas
consumption, instead basing a large part of its gas charges on the
costs of reserving space on interstate pipelines to bring supplies
to Georgia from the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Before Georgia's new natural gas deregulation law took effect
Nov. 1, AGL charged its customers for gas monthly based entirely on
how much gas was actually consumed in each home or business.
</P>
<P>
   But when deregulation allowed AGL customers for the first time
to start purchasing gas from alternate suppliers, the company
instituted a new rate structure designed to guarantee it would
recover transportation costs before customers switched to a new
group of marketers.
</P>
<P>
   When December was much warmer than unusual, consumers were
billed for pipeline charges regardless of how much gas they
actually consumed. Switchboards at the PSC and gas company were
flooded with calls.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers also flocked in droves to the marketers that are now
selling gas at unregulates rates.
</P>
<P>
   As of this week, 284,000 of AGL's 1.5 million customers had
switched to a marketer. That's 19 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   Once 33 percent have switched, the rest will be assigned at
random to marketers on the basis of the market share each one has
attracted. AGL will then exit the business of selling gas and be
responsible only for delivering gas to homes and companies at rates
set by the PSC.
</P>
<P>
   In an address to the Atlanta Rotary Club Monday at the downtown
Merchandise Mart, Higgins said the billing system was ``a failure''
and said the utility would go back to charging on the basis of
actual usage.
</P>
<P>
   ``A new pricing mechanism will be put into place,'' he said.
Consumers will no longer `be charges for gas you didn't use,' ''
Higgins said.
</P>
<P>
   But the settlement is expected to fall short of a recommendation
from the PSC staff last week that called for refunds of $25 million
in ``overcollected'' revenues and re-regulation of the utility by
the PSC.
</P>
<P>
   Customers on average would receive a refund of $16.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary staff recommendation also called for the PSC to
set rates for interstate pipeline capacity at one-third what the
company has been charging.

 &HT;    From ball boy to the Super Bowl
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ From Black Mountain to the Super Bowl. From ballboy to
president. From hero-worshipper to king of the hill.
</P>
<P>
   In that capsuled synopsis, you have the life in football of
Taylor W. Smith, who is 45 but looks younger. Who is an executive
in the harsh field of professional football, but until just lately
you'd hardly have known it. Who never made a tackle, threw a block
or returned a punt for the Falcons but who now stands as their man
out front.
</P>
<P>
   Not to overlook his own playing career. ``We won the only state
championship Lovett School ever won when I was there, and I was on
the team,'' he said. ``I caught some passes and played defensive
back, and I'm right there in the picture of the winning team.''
</P>
<P>
   There was pride in his voice. Still reveres his old coach, Bill
Conley, who would stand on the sideline wearing a Falcons hat.
Rankin Smith Sr. was a major benefactor of Lovett and chairman of
the board at one time. All five Smith children were schooled there.
Before Taylor, Rankin Jr. had played well enough to win a
scholarship to Georgia. Taylor was slight but speedy, fast enough
to run on the track team. He, too, went to Georgia, but played no
football.
</P>
<P>
   But, back to the Falcons, and what is this Black Mountain all
about?
</P>
<P>
   Black Mountain is a village about 20 miles east of Asheville,
N.C., and there the Falcons held their first preseason camp in
1966. The Falcons headquarters was a YMCA camp, with rustic
amenities, mosquitos, scurrying varmints and nature's
air-conditioning. There were horror stories about Black Mountain
that survived for years, of the rocky practice field, of the
clanging bell that brought the weary bodies to life at 6 a.m., no
beer hall around, but there was a prominent neighbor, Dr. Billy
Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to drop in for a visit,'' Taylor said. ``I remember
meeting him.''
</P>
<P>
   He was 13 at the time, sort of an apprentice ballboy. ``You had
to be 16 to be a real ballboy. We took a house up there, and I
remember the coaches and officials used to come by. I remember Gene
Cronin, who had played in the NFL. I'd never met anybody who'd ever
played in the NFL before. He was big and impressive, the first
general manager.''
</P>
<P>
   From that humble beginning, the Falcons have taken a long and
bumpy route to the Super Bowl, 33 years down the road. The
switchboard operator at Suwanee proudly greets all callers,
``Hello, NFC Champion Atlanta Falcons.'' For all the slanderous
abuse heaped on the Smiths, it should be pointed out that there are
eight other teams that have never been to the Super Bowl: the
Oilers, the Seahawks, the Saints; three ancient franchises, the
Browns, the Lions, the Cardinals; and the two latest, the Jaguars
and the Panthers. So much for the fallow Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor moved up the organization ladder, learning the business
department by department. His happiest times, though, were those
spent on the sideline in the earlier days of the franchise,
``Watching Joe Namath, Jim Brown, Gale Sayers and all the great
players. It was like watching a Hall of Fame go by.'' he said. ``It
has been fun growing up with this. I remember all the good times,
forget the bad.''
</P>
<P>
   He moved in as vice president in 1986, became president in 1990
and had a major hand in bringing Dan Reeves to town in 1997. ``We
had come close to hiring him several years before. The decision was
between him and Leeman Bennett. I'd thought we were going to get
Dan, but Eddie LeBaron was hired to run the team and three days
later he hired Leeman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leeman and Dad got along great. They hunted and fished
together, had a lot of the same interests. I guess of all the
coaches, I was closest to June Jones. We'd sort of grown up here
together. I'm just sorry it didn't work out better for him.''
</P>
<P>
   To say that the Falcons, operating as The Five Smiths Inc., has
been a Pop and Family operation would not be a stretch. ``Hire good
people, let them do the job, that's the theory. We never really got
the right people to do the job until now. Dad and I agreed on Dan
Reeves, and we were excited to get him. I'm a Dan Reeves fan. We
wanted someone who could take total control and run the whole
organization. It has been his show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew he was going to be let go in New York, and I made the
call. He said if there was any job he'd take, it was this one. It
was a natural for us and for him, to get him back to Georgia. A lot
of people didn't think too much of hiring a coach who had been
fired twice. When we had the press conference to introduce him,
there was a lot of skepticism in that room at the dome. I think
that has been covered by now. Dad never did give up thinking that
some day we might go to the Super Bowl. I'm just sorry he can't be
around to share it, but it was his decision that put us there.''
</P>
<P>
   Once out of high school in Americus, Reeves' career strangely
had never included his home state. He had been injured his senior
season and when recruiting time came, neither Georgia nor Georgia
Tech made a pass at him. South Carolina offered a scholarship and
he accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little story that tells you the kind of standards
the Reeves family lives by,'' Taylor said. ``Dan was invited to
play in the high school all-star game that summer, and he was voted
the outstanding player. Georgia Tech and Georgia both came after
him then, but Dan's father said, 'Sorry, it's too late. He is
already committed to South Carolina. We don't do business that
way.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Rankin Smith was not one of these team owners who stroll the
sideline during games, striking a pose for television. Of the many
coaches he ran through, Bennett was the one who came closest to
catching the brass ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was heartbreak season for Dad,'' Taylor said. ``Winning
every week. Home-field advantage. Up by 10 points over Dallas with
a few minutes to play, then losing on our own field. I could feel
sorry for those people in Minnesota last week. We'd been there.''
</P>
<P>
   So, riding the crest, deflecting his personal glory, the former
ballboy carries the ball for the Family Smith, most of all,
deferring in retrospect to the image of his father, who died too
soon to see his last stroke of judgment borne out.

LEWINSKY DOES NOT WANT TO BE A WITNESS, HER LAWYERS SAY

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the Senate's decision whether to call Monica
Lewinsky as a witness looming later this week, her lawyers said
Monday that she did not want to participate in a proceeding that
they called ``an unseemly circus.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers, Jacob Stein and Plato Cacheris, said Ms.
Lewinsky had no interest in providing the House managers with a
deposition or appearing as a witness at the Senate impeachment
trial of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``She now has a compelling interest in avoiding her use by
others into what cannot be anything but an unseemly circus,'' Stein
and Cacheris said in a joint statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, House managers on Monday put the finishing touches on
their witness list, which they said will name five or six
witnesses. Ms. Lewinsky is expected to be at the top of the list.
</P>
<P>
   Stein and Cacheris explained Monday why Ms. Lewinsky had
challenged a motion in federal court here by the Office of
Independent Counsel seeking to compel her to submit to questioning
by House prosecutors or his office. ``Ms. Lewinsky raised the issue
of OIC's role simply because it put her in the false light of
appearing as a partisan,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   They also defended Ms. Lewinsky's performance during the
interview, saying that she had ``fully cooperated'' with the three
House managers' questions and did not mean to suggest otherwise
when she said, according to a friend, ``I gave them nothing.'' Ms.
Lewinsky's associates said Monday that her lawyers and family were
troubled that some people might infer from the remark that Ms.
Lewinsky had purposefully withheld information from House managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``She answered every question they asked,'' Stein and Cacheris
said in their statement.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky was asked several questions about the chain of
events surrounding her decision to turn over to Clinton's
secretary, Betty Currie, some gifts he had given her that were
subpoenaed by lawyers for Paula Jones, a crucial element cited by
the Republicans in their charge that Clinton had obstructed
justice.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky was also asked a series of questions about the
assistance given to her by Vernon Jordan, a close friend of the
president, as she searched for a job in New York.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Cacheris said that Ms. Lewinsky ``added nothing to
the record that is already sitting before the Senate.'' But several
media organizations reported Monday that Ms. Lewinsky gave a
slightly different account from her previous testimony in one
important respect.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican counsel at the interview said Ms. Lewinsky
acknowledged that she might have received several telephone calls
from Mrs. Currie on Dec. 28, 1997, the day she gave the secretary
the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   In previous testimony, Ms. Lewinsky said she thought she gave
the gifts to Mrs. Currie at about 2 p.m. But the White House
pointed out that a cellular telephone call showed that Mrs. Currie
phoned Ms. Lewinsky at 3:32 p.m., implying that she could not have
been calling about picking up the gifts if she had already
retrieved them by then.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have suggested that Ms. Currie may have been
acting at Clinton's direction and that she had called Mrs. Lewinsky
on her cell phone to arrange the pickup. White House lawyers have
argued that the phone call lasted a minute or less, not enough time
to arrange a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Several associates of Ms. Lewinsky insisted that she did not
modify her testimony Sunday on that or any other matter.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's office said Monday that the Office of Independent
Counsel provided Ms. Lewinsky with a round-trip, coach airline
ticket from Los Angeles to Washington and a single room at the
Mayflower Hotel. Ms. Lewinsky, not realizing that Starr's office
had paid for a coach ticket, purchased her own first-class ticket,
an associate said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   And the Mayflower Hotel provided free of charge its $5,000
presidential suite for the meeting Sunday between Ms. Lewinsky and
the House managers.

MANAGERS' MOVE ON LEWINSKY A POLITICAL IRRITANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If their decision to interview Monica Lewinsky was
meant to infuse some life into a drama that most Americans say they
want canceled, the House managers have succeeded. Perhaps not in
the way they intended, however.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than simply bolster their case, as they presumably
intended, President Clinton's accusers set off a chain reaction of
complicated legal and political events that seemed to hurt their
cause Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said that the most significant fallout
appeared to be that, by choosing not to get the Senate leadership's
consent first, the prosecutors had exacerbated tensions within
their party to the point where they might hasten the conclusion of
Clinton's impeachment trial. At the same time, legal scholars said
the House Republicans' decision to question Lewinsky without Senate
sanction also put them on weak constitutional ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such a disastrous move in so many ways for the
Republicans that it may even be turning Rehnquist's stomach,'' said
Douglas Brinkley, director of the Eisenhower Center for American
Studies at the University of New Orleans, referring to Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist, who presides over the Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The questioning of Lewinsky, especially by bringing back Ken
Starr, one of the least popular men in America, was just a
gargantuan, unforgivable blunder on the part of the House
Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Other specialsts used less caustic language, but most agreed
that the media onslaught created by Lewinsky's questioning at a
Washington hotel Sunday had reminded wary senators of what may come
if they decide to take public testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Senate may vote to hear witnesses, Lewinsky's
appearance may have deterred some lawmakers who are still on the
fence and probably persuaded others to at least minimize the number
of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Especially troubling, analysts said, was the way in which the
prosecutors arranged for their informal questioning of Lewinsky.
They asked Starr to arrange for her to appear before the Republican
lawmakers, and the special prosecutor complied.
</P>
<P>
   What the House members did not do, saying they were not legally
bound to do so, was ask the Senate for permission first. And that
omission not only fueled already hot Democratic criticism but, by
all accounts, also irked some Republican senators who felt House
managers had circumvented the Senate's authority and skirted the
prescribed constitutional process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a kind of turning point,'' said Vincent
Moscardelli, a political scientist at the University of
Massachusetts-Amerherst. ``The House managers sort of went behind
the Senate Republicans' backs. . .and that leads the senators to
fear that they're not in control of this thing anymore. That's got
to become a real fear for them.''
</P>
<P>
   John Zogby, a national pollster based in New York State, said
the Democrats' anger over Lewinsky's questioning had all but
ensured the party would vote as a block against calling witnesses.
Several analysts concurred, saying the fact of Starr and the
prosecutors working in tandem had fed a perception that some
Republicans were on a crusade to get the president.
</P>
<P>
   Within the GOP, Zogby added, the House managers' action may have
caused an ``irreparable'' split over the witness issue _ with many
senators irate at the House managers, some moderates upset with
their leadership for allowing events to have progressed this far,
and tensions generally running high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was on this track anyway,'' said Zagby, expressing
a view that was stated often Monday. ``But I think that ...
combined with the president's state of the union address, which was
the biggest factor, the result is that the trial is going to get
speeded up.''
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional controversy over Lewinsky's questioning stems
from a Supreme Court's ruling that the Senate is the sole trier of
impeachments. Most legal scholars had assumed that meant, once a
trial had begun, senators had to authorize any action taken in
connection with the proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers argued, however, that their action was part
of their pretrial duties in preparing their case. Having failed to
get Lewinsky to submit to a voluntary interview, they asked Starr
last week to file an emergency motion on their behalf with a
federal judge to get her compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Starr argued in his filing that he had the authority to order
Lewinsky to talk as part of her immunity deal with the special
prosecutor's office, and the judge ruled in his favor Friday
evening. With the court's entry onto the playing field, that raised
the first major legal dispute to arise out of Clinton's impeachment
trial _ over the constitutional separation of powers.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin asked Rehnquist to rule Friday that the court
had overstepped its bounds. The chief justice left Capitol Hill
without dealing with the issue last week, though, but Monday he
rejected the Iowa senator's request.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view it is quite debatable whether merely interviewing a
witness'' would violate the impeachment trial rules requiring
Senate approval before sworn testimony can be taken, Rehnquist said
in a letter to Harkin.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional scholars took a dim view of the prosecutors'
action, saying it seemingly violated the spirit if not the letter
of the law. But most of those interviewed said the bigger
consequence was political, not legal.
</P>
<P>
   ``By doing this, the House is daring the Senate in a way, and I
think it's extraordinarily awkward and divisive,'' said Wendy
Parnet, a professor of constitutional law at Northeastern
University. But she added that she understood why the House
Republicans took such a risky step.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess from their perspective Friday afternoon, they were
losing'' said Parnet, ``so why not throw the dice?''

 &HT;    So what if Falcons don't have Bronco's storied past?
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Let's reset the parties to the big Super Bowl blood
feud, in case there is any lingering confusion about who's who or
where they stand. This is how Atlanta has sorted it out, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Reeves: Kindly out-patient and grandfather, who's not afraid
to cry in public. The man who delivered the Falcons out of the
wilderness. Moses with a whistle.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Shanahan: Back-stabbing ferret.
</P>
<P>
   John Elway: L'enfant terrible. Requires coaches to both consult
him and burp him.
</P>
<P>
   There, with that now settled, we might move on to some serious
comparative analysis between the two Super Bowl cities these men
represent.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta enters this one having to answer many questions about
its fitness as a pro-football town. There is a long history of
empty seats for which to account. All those television blackouts to
explain.
</P>
<P>
   We'll take care of that up front. Very simply, those Falcons
reeked. How many funerals must a person attend? The fact that those
Falcons weren't on TV was a blessing, a community service. C-Span
offered more dramatic programming.
</P>
<P>
   Denver, meanwhile, throws its season-ticket waiting list and its
29-year home-sellout streak in our face and challenges anyone to
show more blind devotion. Nobody can pass a stadium referendum
quicker or harass the local quarterback more thoroughly than the
Mile High people.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a player in Denver _ like receiver Ed McCaffrey _ you
can put your name on a common mustard, throw it out on the local
market, and the people will lap it up like spring water in the
desert.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't quite reached that stage yet in Atlanta. But as soon
as there's a Bob Whitfield-brand Vienna sausage, I'm calling a
moving company.
</P>
<P>
   There truly is a special relationship between the Broncos and
their town, one that eludes Atlanta. Reeves offered a thumbnail
historical perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that's unique about Denver is that they almost lost
that franchise. Actually, fans went out and sold tickets door to
door to keep that football team there,'' he said, referring to a
pivotal time, 1965, in the Broncos American Football League
beginning. ``Pat (Bowlen) owns it, but you'd have a tough time
convincing the people there that they don't own the football team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that you'd have the feeling in Atlanta. There's a
feeling in Atlanta that the Smiths own it and they were lucky to
get it. They maybe feel a lot of people would probably be better
owners and so forth. I don't know that you have a feeling that it's
our football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Or one could argue that Atlanta just has a better grasp on
reality. We put our energies, for example, into building a halfway
functional airport. Denver spent all those gazillions of dollars on
their state-of-the-art place, and folks still weren't getting their
baggage before the clothes inside went out of fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we realize that pro football is merely a diversion, a
frolic. Our brains get more oxygen at lower elevation, and we see
the world more clearly. There are some things of greater
importance: Faith, family, the Georgia-Auburn game.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever becomes of the Falcons on Sunday, they already have
remade Atlanta into a city that gives a passing hoot about the NFL.
That's good enough. Anything more is just wasted hysteria.

 &HT;    Inside the Super Bowl: Reeves plays own game
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli and Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Some Super Bowl observers insist that Atlanta Falcons
coach Dan Reeves intentionally re-opened old wounds with Denver
Broncos coach Mike Shanahan and quarterback John Elway last week to
keep the pressures of the Super Bowl from his team.
</P>
<P>
   And a few league executives think Reeves used the NFL itinerary
provided after the Falcons defeated Minnesota in the NFC
championship game as a motivational ploy. Several newspapers,
including the Journal-Constitution, noted that after the game
Reeves received a letter from the league that listed Vikings coach
Dennis Green in the opening.
</P>
<P>
   League public relations and Super Bowl executives dispute that
claim. They said that the itinerary the Falcons received included
the names of all four conference finalists and the names of all
four head coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Revisionist history
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1996, the Broncos pursued defensive end Chuck
Smith for a while as an unrestricted free agent. But the Denver
braintrust _ which at the time included current Falcons general
manager Harold Richardson _ decided Smith wasn't worth his asking
price. Denver instead signed free agent end Alfred Williams to a
five-year contract worth $1.8 million annually. Smith re-signed
with the Falcons for $10 million over four years. In the three
seasons with their respective teams, Williams, who missed six games
to injury this season, has 130 tackles and 24 1/2 sacks, and Smith
has 246 tackles and 26 1/2 sacks.
</P>
<P>
   What's in it for me?
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have been in demand at their hotel, as
autograph-seekers populate the lobby, and TV personalities tend to
hover in the same fashion. When defensive tackle Travis Hall was
late for a live spot on an Atlanta TV station Sunday night, a
producer saw running back Jamal Anderson just after he finished a
live spot for another Atlanta station.
</P>
<P>
   The producer begged Anderson to stand in, as the show was about
to come out of a commercial break. Anderson said, ``Man, you all
know I'm a show-stopper, not a fill-in.'' Anderson then consented,
of course, to the interview.
</P>
<P>
   Look at me, Mom!
</P>
<P>
   Hall and Anderson were seated side by side as midnight
approached, getting ready to do a live spot for a TV station in
Utah. Anderson played collegiately at Utah in Salt Lake City, Hall
at Brigham Young in Provo. Before going on the air, Hall grabbed
Anderson's cell phone and placed a call to Utah. ``Mom! Mom!'' he
hollered in the phone. ``I'm going to be on TV in 12 minutes; turn
on the TV!'' While they were waiting to go on air, Anderson's
brother Jay and cousin Drew were videotaping the whole thing.
``Hey, Jam,'' Jay said. ``I got the latest Sporting News.''
Anderson couldn't turn his head as his earplug was being adjusted.
``Am I on the cover, man?'' he asked. Hall responded by saying,
``MJ (Michael Jordan) retires, and my man ends up on the cover. How
huge is that? Jam is large!''
</P>
<P>
   Scenes from Miami
</P>
<P>
   You see some strange things at Super Bowls. After midnight
Sunday, middle linebacker Jessie Tuggle, backup Ruffin Hamilton,
reserve linebacker Ben Talley and reserve running back Gary Downs
all emerged from a white limo in front of the team hotel. As they
entered the lobby, Talley had a huge bag of corn chips and an
orange soda in his hands, and nearby reserve safety Devin Bush was
complaining. Bush, who went to nearby Hialeah Lakes High School,
was one of several players who earlier had gone to the ``All-Star
Cafe'' downtown. ``Man, people spilled beer on my (orange suede)
shoes,'' he said.

 &HT;    Taylor: Hall vote is on game, not shame
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The greatest defensive player in his era finds out this
week if highlights on NFL Films carry more weight than cameos on
Hard Copy.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Taylor held a conference call Monday to air his
feelings before Pro Football Hall of Fame voters decide Saturday
whether to enshrine him in Canton, Ohio. Taylor redefined the
linebacker position during his career with the New York Giants, but
he has had a string of drug problems, most recently in October when
he was arrested for purchasing $50 worth of crack cocaine from an
undercover officer in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor had a lot to say Monday, but the words, ``I'm sorry,''
weren't among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not losing sleep over it, if I make it or not,'' Taylor
said. ``Yes, I would love to be in there. I expect to be in there.
I think I've worked hard enough to be in there. But, yes, I've had
problems in my life. Has L.T. had problems? Yes, guilty. Has he
ever been through controversy? Yes, guilty. Will he go through more
controversy? Yes, guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``If you're asking me to apologize or feel
remorseful, I can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor needs to gain 29 of 36 votes for Hall induction. Some
voters already have said they will vote against Taylor because of
his off-the-field problems.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his drug arrests should be a criteria for the Hall,
Taylor said, ``Based on the bylaws, it should be a no-brainer. . .
. If you're going to start bringing up off-the-field problems, you
might have to kick out half the people in that Hall of Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he had ever thought about playing for a team other
than the Giants, Taylor said, ``I thought about being a No. 1 draft
pick of New Orleans. But then I probably would've ended up in rehab
earlier.''

 &HT;    It's a buyer's market as Super Bowl tickets fetch lower prices
 &HT;    By Ralph Ellis
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Todd Rubin, a ticket broker from Miami, sent three
employees to Minneapolis for the NFC playoff game. They were
supposed to wheel and deal for Super Bowl tickets after the Vikings
beat the Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   When the Falcons won the game, Rubin told those employees to
jump on a plane and go to Atlanta. But after a few days, he brought
them home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a waste of my money to have guys in Atlanta to buy
tickets,'' Rubin said Monday. ``I have a big ad in the Atlanta
paper, but I haven't bought or sold one ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin and other brokers say that ticket prices for Super Bowl
XXXIII are noticeably lower than for last year's game in San Diego,
largely because fans in Atlanta and Denver aren't shelling out the
inflated prices brokers demand.
</P>
<P>
   The cheapest tickets, located in the upper levels of the end
zones, were selling for $1,100 to $1,400 on Monday, hundreds of
dollars less than for last year's Super Bowl. The most expensive
tickets, in the lower level between the 40-yard lines, were selling
for $3,500 to $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin predicted that the cheapest tickets will drop to about
$1,000. Mark Halpern of Front and Center Tickets in Fort Lauderdale
said he's not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the upper end zones, I was charging $1,700 last Monday,''
Halpern said. ``This weekend I was at $1,250. Today, I'm at $1,450.
Prices do fluctuate.''
</P>
<P>
   Brokers got more bad news on Monday, when season-ticket holders
in Atlanta and Denver picked up their Super Bowl tickets with a
face value of $325 per ticket. Some of those fans will sell their
Super Bowl tickets, further flooding the market.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers say Super Bowl XXXIII is not a hot ticket because
Atlanta and Denver aren't glamour teams that draw fans from all
over the country, like the Dallas Cowboys or the San Francisco
49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Denver fans aren't turning out because of the distance to Miami
and because the Broncos have been to the Super Bowl five times
before, said Zach Anderson of Ticket City in Austin, Tex. Halpern
said he's not sure why Atlanta fans aren't buying his tickets, but
he decided to pull his ad in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution
because it wasn't doing any good.
</P>
<P>
   The prices won't go low enough to suit some Atlanta fans.
Throughout town, prospective buyers expressed sticker shock.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Rex Smith of Alpharetta paid $175 per ticket _ face
value for season-ticket holders _ to watch the Cowboys beat the
Bills in Super Bowl in the Georgia Dome. Smith didn't have season
tickets this year, so he put a classified ad in the paper, hoping
to pay $500 to $600 per ticket. The lowest price he's heard is
$1,500 for an end-zone ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about the worst seats in the stadium,'' Smith
said Monday. ``I did not realize those types of dollars were passed
for tickets. . . . I don't think it's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Bross of Peachtree City had season tickets but wasn't
picked in the lottery. She or her husband has entered every ticket
contest put on by radio stations, car dealers and restaurants. She
also wants to spend a little over face value, but the lowest price
she's heard is $1,200 per ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our family could go on a trip for $2,400,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Stadium size might be another factor.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's game at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego was attended
by 68,912 fans. Only the very first Super Bowl, played in Los
Angeles in 1967, and the 1992 game in Minneapolis drew smaller
crowds. Pro Player Stadium in Miami will seat about 75,000 people.
The extra seats apparently aren't helping in the already-weak
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year the market was very, very high for both buyers and
sellers,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Georgia Dome, long-time season-ticket holders spent their
lunch breaks picking up Super Bowl tickets. Two weeks ago, a
lottery determined which season-ticket holders would be given the
opportunity. Letters were mailed to the winners the Friday before
the NFC championship game, and the tickets had to be paid for last
week.
</P>
<P>
   William G. Revere, of Atlanta, a retired Atlanta public
schoolteacher and assistant band director at Morris Brown College,
said no one has offered to buy his tickets. He wouldn't sell them
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't even entertained the thought of selling my
tickets,'' said Revere, who is taking a bus to Miami. ``Maybe next
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Thompson of Atlanta said she was accosted by people wanting
to buy tickets when she drove away from the ticket booth. The
average offer was about $1,100, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Williams of Atlanta said he and his wife, Barbara, will
make the trip to Miami. They have been offered as much as $3,000
for the pair of tickets they bought for $650.
</P>
<P>
   ``No amount of money would make us want to give up these
tickets,'' said Williams, wearing a black Falcons hat. ``This is
our one shot. Right here in this millennium, and we are going.''

 &HT;    Atlanta Gas Light Co. to issue refunds in rate settlement
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Public Service Commission scheduled a special meeting today
to ratify a settlement with Atlanta Gas Light Co. that the company
hopes will put to rest an uproar over its new rate system.
</P>
<P>
   Details were still being negotiated late Monday in advance of
the 5 p.m. meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Company spokesman Ross Willis said AGL expects to make refunds
to between 200,000 and 300,000 customers who ended up paying
exhorbitant rates when they used little or no gas during November
and December.
</P>
<P>
   ``The refunds will be directed to those that were hurt the
most,'' Willis said. Those who saw the largest impact were the
150,000 ``heat-only'' customers who use gas for winter heating, but
not for hot water heaters or other uses.
</P>
<P>
   Walter M. Higgins, chief executive of the utility, said AGL
would go back to charging customers on the basis of gas
consumption, instead basing a large part of its gas charges on the
costs of reserving space on interstate pipelines to bring supplies
to Georgia from the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Before Georgia's new natural gas deregulation law took effect
Nov. 1, AGL charged its customers for gas monthly based entirely on
how much gas was actually consumed in each home or business.
</P>
<P>
   But when deregulation allowed AGL customers for the first time
to start purchasing gas from alternate suppliers, the company
instituted a new rate structure designed to guarantee it would
recover transportation costs before customers switched to a new
group of marketers.
</P>
<P>
   When December was much warmer than unusual, consumers were
billed for pipeline charges regardless of how much gas they
actually consumed. Switchboards at the PSC and gas company were
flooded with calls.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers also flocked in droves to the marketers that are now
selling gas at unregulates rates.
</P>
<P>
   As of this week, 284,000 of AGL's 1.5 million customers had
switched to a marketer. That's 19 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   Once 33 percent have switched, the rest will be assigned at
random to marketers on the basis of the market share each one has
attracted. AGL will then exit the business of selling gas and be
responsible only for delivering gas to homes and companies at rates
set by the PSC.
</P>
<P>
   In an address to the Atlanta Rotary Club Monday at the downtown
Merchandise Mart, Higgins said the billing system was ``a failure''
and said the utility would go back to charging on the basis of
actual usage.
</P>
<P>
   ``A new pricing mechanism will be put into place,'' he said.
Consumers will no longer `be charges for gas you didn't use,' ''
Higgins said.
</P>
<P>
   But the settlement is expected to fall short of a recommendation
from the PSC staff last week that called for refunds of $25 million
in ``overcollected'' revenues and re-regulation of the utility by
the PSC.
</P>
<P>
   Customers on average would receive a refund of $16.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary staff recommendation also called for the PSC to
set rates for interstate pipeline capacity at one-third what the
company has been charging.

CELLULAR CALL HOLDS GREAT PORTENT FOR MANAGERS' CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House managers consider it the closest thing to a
smoking gun in the impeachment trial: a recently discovered
cellular telephone record that the prosecutors believe proves
President Clinton obstructed justice.
</P>
<P>
   As House managers see it, the cellular phone call from the
president's secretary, Betty Currie, to former intern Monica S.
Lewinsky shows that Currie was acting at the president's behest to
pick up Clinton's gifts at Lewinsky's apartment. But Clinton's
defense lawyers say the records prove the opposite, that Currie
called Lewinsky after she picked up gifts at Lewinsky's request.
</P>
<P>
   This one-minute phone call is one of the factual disputes that
could be a turning point in the impeachment trial. On Sunday, House
managers questioned Lewinsky, who reportedly provided new
information that Currie made several calls before picking up the
gifts. House managers said the dispute over the phone record is a
key reason to call Lewinsky and Currie as witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The cellular phone call in question occurred on Dec. 28, 1997.
By this date, the sexual conduct between Lewinsky and Clinton had
ended, and the president knew that Lewinsky was on a list of
possible witnesses in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit.
Lewinsky, according to her grand jury testimony, entered the White
House at 8:16 a.m., met with Clinton, and received a ``Christmas
kiss'' from him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, as he had in the past, then gave Lewinsky a number of
gifts, according to the report by independent counsel Kenneth W.
Starr: a marble bear's head, a Rockettes blanket, a stuffed animal
from the Black Dog store on Martha's Vineyard, a box of chocolates,
a pair of joke sunglasses, and a pin with a New York skyline.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's defense attorneys have said that Clinton's gifts prove
the president was not trying to obstruct justice. After all, the
Clinton lawyers say, if the president was so interested in hiding
his gifts to Lewinsky at the time, why did he give her more on this
day?
</P>
<P>
   But the House managers have focused on what happened next in the
meeting. Lewinsky told the president she was worried that her
subpoena in the Jones case mentioned a hat pin given to her by the
president. That ``sort of bothered'' the president, Lewinsky
testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I should put the gifts away outside my house somewhere
or give them to someone, maybe Betty,'' Lewinsky told the
president, according to her testimony. She said the president
responded either ``I don't know'' or ``Let me think about that.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened next is the key to understanding the obstruction
of justice charge. According to Lewinsky, Currie called her in the
afternoon and said either ``I understand you have something to give
me'' or ``The president said you have something to give me.''
Currie then came to Lewinsky's apartment and picked up the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Currie, however, testified she thought Lewinsky had called her
and that she couldn't remember whether Clinton told her about the
gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did the president know you were holding these things for
Monica?
</P>
<P>
   Currie: I don't know. I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Didn't he say to you that Monica had something for you to
hold?
</P>
<P>
   Currie: I don't remember that. I don't.
</P>
<P>
   The House prosecution team, which relied mostly on evidence from
the Starr investigation, recently discovered the cellular telephone
billing record that seemed to back up Lewinsky's description by
showing that Currie called Lewinsky at 3:22 p.m. on Dec. 28, 1997.
The House managers, in a written report, said the phone record is a
``key piece of evidence that Ms. Currie's fuzzy recollection is
wrong. . . (It) proves conclusively that Ms. Currie called Monica
from her cell phone several hours after she had left the White
House.''
</P>
<P>
   But the White House defense team seized upon the same phone
record to show that Clinton did not obstruct justice. White House
counsel Charles F. C. Ruff noted that Lewinsky on three occasions
stated that Currie came for the gifts around 2 p.m., more than an
hour and a half before the cellular records indicate that Currie
called Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democratic senators responded to Ruff's revelation by
declaring that Clinton's lawyers had just destroyed the obstruction
of justice charge.
</P>
<P>
   One of the president's attorneys, Cheryl D. Mills, told the
Senate last week that the ``real story of the gifts'' is that
Lewinsky asked Currie to come pick up them up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Currie did not raise Ms. Lewinsky's request with the
president because she saw herself as doing a favor for her
friend,'' Mills said. ``Ms. Currie had no idea the gifts were under
subpoena, and so Ms. Lewinsky's request hardly struck her as
criminal.'
</P>
<P>
   That prompted House managers on Sunday to question Lewinsky
about events leading to Currie's pickup of the gifts. According to
The Washington Post, Lewinsky told the House managers that Currie
called several times on Dec. 28, 1997, a statement that could
support the House managers' contention that Currie called Lewinsky
before picking up the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the cellular phone call remains unresolved. Currie
has said her memory is hazy about the details. Clinton has denied
telling Currie to pick up the gifts. Lewinsky has said Currie did
call before picking up the gifts. The question now is whether the
House team will be able to call witnesses and question Lewinsky on
the Senate floor.

 &HT;    Twice cut, finally at home
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Falcons defensive tackle Shane Dronett sang country
songs at Joe's Stone Crab, the famous eatery on South Beach, on
Sunday night. The past few years, Dronett's career has taken a
major step up, from a twice-cut player without a position to
playing a key role on a team playing in the Super Bowl with the No.
2 run defense in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Dronett is a key factor as Atlanta prepares to face Broncos
running back Terrell Davis, who led the NFL with 2,008 rushing
yards. He had a career-high 78 total tackles during the regular
season, and his 6 1/2 sacks were half a sack short of his career
high. He was chosen the team's defensive MVP in three of 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive line coach Bill Kollar, who in 1996 granted Dronett's
wish and released him, said the key is that Dronett keeps his
center of gravity down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shane can play pretty stout when he keeps his pad level
down,'' he said. ``He's worked his (rear) off and done a heck of a
job for us, really. He's improved a heck of a lot, mostly by
staying low.''
</P>
<P>
   Dronett, 28, is happy, too. ``It has worked out,'' he said.
``How could it get much better, other than us winning Sunday?''
</P>
<P>
   Dronett was drafted in the second round in 1992 by Denver when
Falcons coach Dan Reeves was coach of the Broncos. He had 53
tackles and 6 1/2 sacks as a rookie and 165 tackles and 19 1/2
sacks his first three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But before the 1995 season, the first under new coach Mike
Shanahan, he was moved to ``under tackle,'' a pass-rushing
position.
</P>
<P>
   Dronett had enough size (6 feet 6, 288 pounds), but not enough
technique. Injuries were a factor, but it was hard to explain a
1995 season in which he had 14 tackles and two sacks in limited
playing time.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos didn't re-sign him before the '96 season, so the
Falcons, under coach June Jones, did. But he played sparingly, and
after a 28-24 loss at Detroit that dropped the Falcons to 0-5, he
wanted out.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the game, I took one step onto the field, and he said,
`You need to let me go,' '' Kollar said. ``I said, `Yeah, we can
probably do that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Dronett was having trouble adjusting. ``It wasn't all Bill or
anyone,'' he said. ``I got so frustrated with myself; I just wanted
to get out of here. When I got here in Atlanta, it was the first
time I played to any extent inside. I kind of started a downward
spiral.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lions picked up Dronett, but he didn't play much, and they
released him in training camp in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta had failed to land former Raiders defensive tackle
La'Roi Glover with a waiver claim, and new Falcons coach Reeves
suggested that the Falcons consider Dronett, and he was signed to a
one-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Kollar was skeptical, but Reeves won out. ``He played soft,''
Kollar said about Dronett's first tour with the team. ``He couldn't
do the things we wanted him to do. We kept working at it, but he
wasn't getting any better.''
</P>
<P>
   Dronett was a pleasant surprise in '97, when he had 40 tackles
and three sacks backing up tackles Travis Hall and Dan Owens.
</P>
<P>
   When Owens signed a free-agent contract before this season with
the Lions, Dronett signed a two-year, $1.6 million contract with
the Falcons and became a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Kollar loves him now. ``He's a hell of a guy, and works
(hard),'' the coach said. ``He doesn't have real quick feet, like
Travis. We do a lot of bag drills to get guys' feet a little better
. . . and he's improved at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dronett sounds like a man living a dream. He opened a sports art
gallery in Duluth, and Sunday, with microphone in hand at Joe's
Stone Crab, he looked like he'd hit the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a lot of work,'' he said. ``I had to adjust to a lot
of things, and focus on technique. Everything has paid off in a big
way.''

JOHN PAUL SEES PROMISE, PERIL IN US 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Perhaps no other country in the world frustrates
Pope John Paul II more than the globe's last remaining superpower,
papal observers say.
</P>
<P>
   And as the 78-year-old pontiff arrives in St. Louis Tuesday for
a two-day visit _ during which he will see President Clinton
privately at the airport and attend a youth rally _ John Paul will
undoubtedly both extol and scold a nation he sees as full of
promise and peril.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, the United States and the pope have been on the
same side in the historic struggle to tear down Communism and bring
democratic values and freedom to once-oppressed lands.
</P>
<P>
   On the other, the United States, with 62 million Roman
Catholics, is the biggest obstacle in John Paul's relentless quest
to plant a vision of society that is more humane, more egalitarian,
and more spiritual.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with the Gospel, he comes to the country that embodies
some of the traits he has said are most alarming in the world _ a
selfish pursuit of wealth, individualism without responsibility,
and a media culture saturated with violence and sex.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has said that a society without a moral anchor runs the
danger of reducing human beings to mere objects without value.
That's a key reason why, in the pope's view, the United States
seems to be so accepting of abortion, the death penalty, and a
economic system that leaves so many mired in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States probably causes the pope more pain than
anyplace else because it is the greatest threat to the church's
authority and the church's mission, as John Paul sees it,'' said
Brian Smith, a religion professor at Ripon College in Ripon, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest concerns of his papacy is the fact that the
United States seems so distant from the ethical principles the pope
fervently promotes,'' he said. ``One message, I think, he'll bring
is that the US has a deep responsibility to be a model to the
world, and it's not doing a good job of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The fundamental problem, many religion scholars say, is that
there is an enormous chasm of understanding between the Vatican and
a vast segment of Catholics in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two competing views clashing here _ one's conscience
versus church teaching,'' said William D'Antonio, adjunct professor
of sociology at Catholic University in Washington, who has
conducted several surveys of American Catholics revealing how far
apart they are from the Vatican on issues ranging from divorce to
married priests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our conscience is the use of our reason to understand issues
around us and to make judgments about them,'' D'Antonio added.
``John Paul, however, says we should look to the church's teaching
authority to help shape our conscience. In this country Catholics
are following their conscience, and their conscience doesn't
automatically make them agree with the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, Thomas Aquinas believed it was better to die
excommunicated than to violate one's conscience. And the Second
Vatican Council seemed to suggest the primacy of conscience, but
the issue is far from resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Favazza, a professor of religious studies at Rhodes College
in Memphis, said, ``In a certain way, the pope sees the idea of
people thinking for themselves as a threat to the unity of the
church.''
</P>
<P>
   To many American Catholics, John Paul is an endearing
grandfather figure who is out of step with society. Many here
regard him as the unyielding leader of a 2,000-year-old patriarchal
and authoritarian institution.
</P>
<P>
   After 20 years and five visits to the United States, John Paul's
repeated exhortations to Catholics to be more loyal to the church
mirrors a growing gap between the Vatican and American Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Periodic surveys conducted between 1970 and 1993 show a decrease
in the percentage of American Catholics agreeing with the church's
positions on such controversial issues as women priests, birth
control, and even abortion, said Ruth Wallace, a professor of
sociology at George Washington University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Even among committed Catholics, those who go to Mass every week
and who say they would never abandon the church, less than
one-third said in a recent survey that moral authority comes solely
from Catholic leaders, according to D'Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's views on church authority, scholars say, were shaped
by his experiences in his native Poland and were influenced by the
world of Roman Catholicism before the Second Vatican Council
attempted to strengthen the voice of lay Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He comes from a tradition where church authority is to be
respected and if there is dissent it should be done quietly behind
closed doors,'' Smith said. ``But in the United States we have all
these Catholic groups openly dissenting.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope's defenders say if John Paul had been influenced by
surveys and demonstrations he long would have given up on the
United States. Instead, they expect him to use what may be his last
visit here to once again hammer home themes close to his heart _
respect for life, responsibility to the poor, and reverence for the
church _ no matter how they are received.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Holy Father has a much more long-term view of things,''
said the Rev. Matthew Lamb, a professor of theology at Boston
College. ``It may take a long time to change the culture, but as
the Apostle Paul wrote, you have to preach the Gospel in season and
out of season.''

HOUSE PROSECUTORS STRUGGLING TO KEEP GOP SENATORS IN LINE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate impeachment trial of President Clinton
has come down to Republicans struggling among themselves over how
best to end an ordeal that has indirectly cost their party two
speakers of the House and unexpected embarrassments.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't supposed to be that way.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was supposed to be impeached and then removed from
office. And Senate Republicans were supposed to help their House
colleagues accomplish that goal.
</P>
<P>
   But things have taken a different turn for House prosecutors in
the Senate trial because Republican opposition to extending their
case _ although only a half dozen or so senators strong _ appears
to be solidifying along with the public sentiment that enough is
enough. In addition, few Democratic senators appear ready to
contribute to the two-thirds majority vote needed for conviction.
</P>
<P>
   At least a half dozen of the 55 Republican senators have raised
reservations publicly about the idea of having former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky and other potential witnesses testify on the
Senate floor. They also have questioned whether their House
colleagues have been able to meet ``the burden of proof beyond a
reasonable doubt,'' they say is required to convict Clinton of
perjury and obstruction of justice as outlined in the two articles
of impeachment against him.
</P>
<P>
   With all 45 Democratic senators united in opposition to
witnesses, only six Republican defections could help them end ``the
nation's nightmare,'' which is how both opponents and supporters of
the president have characterized the scandal over his illicit
affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans are struggling, with some help from Senate
Republican leaders, to keep the handful of GOP colleagues now
inclined to side with the Democrats from voting to dismiss the case
and not to call witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of my colleagues who will not likely vote
for witnesses,'' Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., said Monday, adding
that House prosecutors have reason to worry ``whether or not the
votes are there,'' for continuing the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Smith joined with another conservative Republican
senator, Richard Shelby of Alabama, in taking the lead on the GOP
side of the aisle in questioning whether the House has made its
case against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Their comments, delivered in a number of interviews over several
days, represented a crack in what House prosecutors had assumed
would be a fairly solid Republican bloc of votes for seeing the
trial through, complete with witnesses and a final up or down vote
on removing Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Shelby are ready to vote it up or down, but like the
Democrats, they're ready to do it now without giving House
prosecutors a chance to call witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's close this thing out. Let's vote on it up or down,''
Shelby said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Among exit proposals being considered is a plan by Sen. Susan
Collins, R-Maine, to vote on a non-binding resolution before voting
on the articles of impeachment. The resolution, which could be
passed by simple majority, would state that Clinton was guilty of
the charges against him and would mitigate the expected failure to
gain a two-thirds majority vote for conviction on the articles.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the proposal violates the Constitution, which
says the Senate should acquit or convict and then remove a
president who is found guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate began debate Monday on a motion offered by Sen.
Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., to dismiss the case against Clinton. The
motion, which will be voted on Tuesday or Wednesday, is expected to
have the support of all 45 Democrats. So, when House Judiciary
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the lead prosecutor in the
trial, rose to speak against the motion, most of his comments
seemed directed at holding Republicans in line.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that the case had been an ``inconvenience'' and
annoyance for the Senate, especially when considered against the
backdrop of polls showing that most Americans want Clinton to
remain in office and blame Republicans for drawing the scandal out.
</P>
<P>
   Those polls have not been lost on Republican senators, who,
unlike most of their House colleagues who represent safe GOP
districts, must run statewide. A number of conservative GOP
senators are expected to have close races in 2000 and are concerned
about the impact their vote on impeachment may have on their
re-election chances.
</P>
<P>
   One recent poll by The Washington Post showed that 47 percent of
those surveyed said they would likely vote against lawmakers who
vote to remove Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these senators are worried for legitimate political
reasons,'' said one Republican consultant to House leaders. ``They
know what their own polls are telling them. But they've also seen
the ranks of the House Republicans decimated over this thing. The
chief victims so far have been two House speakers, who were forced
to resign because of it, and a bunch of members who have seen their
own sex lives dragged out into public.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they look at all that,'' he said, ``it's going to be easy
for some senators to say (House prosecutors) haven't met the burden
of proof.''
</P>
<P>
   But when that point will come is still unclear. Nonetheless,
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, noted in
an interview with CBS News that ``the right point of frustration
may be near.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody here knows that there really isn't a possibility of
getting the 67 votes for conviction,'' Hatch said. ``So, there will
come a time when we're going to have to try and resolve this,
hopefully, in the best bipartisan way we can.''

   WASHINGTON _ Upstairs, the impeachment trial was going through
serial delays as the Senate once more struggled to hold off
partisan meltdown. But downstairs, at least, at the head of an
escalator, the senior senator from Iowa politely yielded basement
debating time to the senior senator from Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did your caucus conclude?'' asked Max Baucus, D-Mont., of
Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, when his colleague recognized him for an
impromptu two-lawmaker debate on a free fall of a day in President
Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my understanding,'' replied Grassley over the escalator
hum, ``that there's something going on between some very senior
respected senators on both sides that could bring something
about.''
</P>
<P>
   It was as if Webster's timeless question of ``Neighbor, how
stands the Union?'' were being put once more in the very bowels of
the Senate as the president's fate was being settled. The jury was
not yet out, but rather out and about, trying to figure out what
was going on as they met in hallway encounters.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of tourists, staffers and reporters gathered around the
two, as they discussed witnesses and other issues in the day's
private leadership attempt at striking a deal to speed the trial to
conclusion. If nothing else the exchange demonstrated the senators'
civility had hardly eroded to the levels of the House impeachment
debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't your concern that you want to make sure this doesn't go
on for a long time?'' Grassley politely asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right,'' responded Baucus as other pedestrians brushed past to
the Capitol's underground tunnels and lunchrooms. ``And, basically,
I'm trying to find a way to let people on your side who feel they
have to cast at least one vote to satisfy certain political
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange was a microcosm of the caucus struggles through
much of the day centering on the question of ending the trial
fairly without yielding the House Republican managers a
time-consuming license to search for fresh witness evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget we're supposed to be running the show, not the
lawyers,'' Grassley stressed, yielding back the basement corridor
floor to his colleague.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our hope,'' replied Baucus with evident doubt, and the
two parted in search of the latest word on their leaders'
differences.
</P>
<P>
   In the corridors outside the caucuses, senators hurriedly passed
to and fro. The high hope in the Democrats' morning sound bites
fell flat by midday. But fresh attempts at reviving a deal were
quickly under way, driven by constitutional duty but also more
mundane factors as time consumption and the impatience of
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the chamber, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist was being
treated to the Senate's ultimate fallback tactic _ a slow quorum
roll call of the members to mark time while assorted negotiations
were under way off the floor. Rehnquist obviously came prepared. He
calmly became engrossed in some private reading matter as the clerk
slowly, ever so slowly, intoned each senator's name in a dirge-like
ritual of time killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to the operations of the United States Senate, Mr.
Chief Justice,'' majority leader Trent Lott of Mississippi
smilingly apologized as the Senate went through start-and-stop
motions and trial debate finally arrived, nearly two hours late.
</P>
<P>
   The senators settled in. A considerate John McCain of Arizona
got a backslap of gratitude when he jerry-built a footrest to ease
the infirmity of his fellow Republican, Jesse Helms of North
Carolina. The Senate mood seemed to be relaxed, for all the
off-the-floor contention. Lott genially worked the Democratic side
of the floor, then nonchalantly hand-edited a word in a procedural
resolution to end a complaint and get the trial back on track.
</P>
<P>
   For two hours the Senate court sat silent, still far from their
showdown impeachment votes, but listening to debate by the
prosecution and defense on a proposed preliminary dismissal of the
charges against the  &QR; 
president.
</P>
<P>
   This seemed certain to fail in a vote expected in a day or two,
after the conclusion of the Senate's own private deliberations. But
after the long day of political caucussing and confusion, this
debate, even if facing a foregone conclusion, suddenly brought the
Senate back to the gravity of the case to banish the president.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors flatly termed Clinton a ``criminal'' and pleaded
with the Senate not to seek an easy way out by dismissal. ``You'll
guarantee contention,'' warned Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, the
chief prosecutor. ``You'll never get it behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   At nightfall, there came a simple, stark reminder of the
enormous stakes for the nation. The 100-member court was sealed in
the Senate to begin its own closed debate on the merits of the
proposal to end the trial now rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   The sergeant-at-arms drove out public witnesses. The double
doors of the Senate were closed tight. The impeachment court
debated into the night and the trial moved a step closer to
deciding the fate of the president.

POPE AIMS MESSAGE AT ELITE, YOUTHS

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Pope John Paul II spent the last full day of his
visit to this adoring country preaching privately to Mexico's elite
and urging hundreds of thousands of youths to carry their religious
faith into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   The pontiff said a morning Mass at the papal nunciate, the
headquarters of the Vatican's representative in Mexico, for about
250 business executives, political leaders, and high-ranking church
officials.
</P>
<P>
   During the service, which was closed to the press, the pope
called on leaders to bring religious values to public life and the
boardroom, according to some who attended and later spoke to
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Although the pontiff regularly says private Masses for
politicians and church patrons when he travels, Monday's gathering
highlighted one of the messages he has outlined in a new vision for
the church in the Americas to reach out to rich and poor alike.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has used this five-day trip to Mexico to lay out a
hemispheric strategy for the church into the next millennium. He
signed a declaration condemning exploitative capitalism,
corruption, racism, drug trafficking, the death penalty, and
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, in the final public appearance of his Mexico trip,
the fourth of his 20-year papacy, John Paul II addressed more than
110,000 people at Azteca Stadium, the country's largest soccer
facility. The theme of the farewell celebration, which featured
television hookups from Buenos Aires to Los Angeles, was the unity
of generations.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech directed at youths, the pope said that the audience
must ensure that their world ``will be oriented towards God, and
that the political or scientific, financial or cultural
institutions be at the service of man, without racial or social
discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   As they have done during each of the pope's rides through the
streets of this capital city, throngs of cheering Mexicans stood
for hours hoping for a fleeting glimpse of the 78-year-old pontiff
as he passed by.
</P>
<P>
   The pope is scheduled to celebrate another private Mass at the
papal nunciate early Tuesday before departing Mexico City for a
two-day visit to St. Louis.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Charles Barkley returned to the Rockets to find his team healthier,
faster and younger. Scottie Pippen was playing point forward as if
he had won all those championships in Houston. Barkley's own health
was so good, he pronounced, ``I'm going to have a great year.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Life was so good, he had found a way to skip two full days of
two-a-days and to serve as a team player in the process. He even
had a perfect retort for those who would cackle about the backswing
that offered comic relief at the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley returned to the Rockets on Monday to find he had life
wired. That's why he couldn't understand why he had let such an
ideal opportunity slip away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know they were going to do two-a-days today since we
had a game,'' Barkley said, referring to tonight's exhibition
against San Antonio at Compaq Center. ``I would have skipped
another day. I could have come up with the imaginary plane
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, however, Barkley joined the Rockets' happy
training camp two days late and just in time.
</P>
<P>
   Teammates raved about his conditioning. Coach Rudy Tomjanovich
had expressed his appreciation for Barkley's willingness to re-up
earlier than planned to allow for the Rockets' salary-cap
maneuvers. And Barkley, still cheered by the good times of
vacation-ending golf, showed off the results of his sudden fitness
binge and promised that more is to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great physically. I feel great mentally, also,''
Barkley said. ``Physically, last year was a nightmare for me, with
the two hernias. I didn't know I had two hernias. I'm glad I got
those taken care of (via surgery). I'm going to play well this
year. I'm excited. I was disappointed in the way I played last
year, because I never felt good physically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now with all my physical ailments out of the way, I am going
to have a great season. I can't worry about everyone else. I have
to keep my own house together, and I am going to have a great
season.''
</P>
<P>
   But first, he had a great time. And for anyone who considered
his golf game good only for gallery hard-hat concessions, a point
teammates had happily reminded, Barkley could point out his golf
game was good enough to earn a few days far from the sweat of
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``My golf game isn't any good,'' Barkley said. ``(But) it got me
out of two-a-days. That was its sole purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a chance to play golf in Palm Springs with Michael
Jordan or go to two-a-days. That's easy. Trust me. People said,
`Man, you're not good at golf.' I say, `You think I'm not good at
golf _ imagine how I'm going to be at two-a-days.' I had two-a-days
(or) golf in Palm Springs with Michael Jordan. That's a no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I'm glad to be back. It's been a long process not
playing basketball. Obviously, I'm glad we got Scottie Pippen. It
was great to see the guys today. I wish the golf tournament was
going on. I didn't know we were going to practice twice today, but
they got me.''
</P>
<P>
   They got him far closer to his 252-pound playing weight and,
teammates had to admit, running well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked good,'' Rockets forward Eddie Johnson said. ``He
came back in shape, and he was running up and down the floor like
he'd been here all along.''
</P>
<P>
   But just in case Barkley was too tempted by Jordan's retirement
lifestyle, Pippen said he would remind his new teammate about what
is expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's willing to go for it,'' Pippen said Saturday.
``Let's come together and do it. I think Charles realizes he has
something to achieve. It's more important for him to win a
championship here in the city of Houston than it is for myself or
for Hakeem (Olajuwon). We as a team want to win a championship, and
he realizes we need him to do that. He's going to have to dedicate
himself. That's a point I will make to him.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, Barkley said he was running better than if he had
been around for the Rockets' first practice. The rushed training
camp had forced the Rockets to practice twice daily since the
contracts were finally approved Friday. And Barkley said he noticed
his teammates had developed ``two-a-day legs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing they said when I walked in today was how tired
they were,'' he said. ``I said, `I'm very refreshed.' I'll take
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan, however, had been for Barkley to be spending this week
considering his options. Barkley said he was surprised by the
interest around the league in signing him. He said about 10 teams
made a run at him. The choices were narrowed to Seattle, Atlanta
and Houston. But though he wanted to choose the team he believed
would have the best championship chance, in the end that was not
why he chose the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to make the final decision who I thought was going to be
the best team,'' Barkley said. ``I felt like whatever team I went
to would have the best chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Vegas with (SuperSonics stars) Vin Baker and Gary
Payton. They were very persuasive. They're both great players, and
they had youth on their side. But the determining factor was Rudy.
I've always said I enjoy my coach a great deal. I'm not sure who
would have had the best team if I went to Seattle. But I know I've
got a great coach here and a great coaching staff and I enjoy
playing for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets could not wait for Barkley to make up his mind,
because they needed to reduce the $4.4 million of cap space he
occupied to the $1 million contract he accepted in order to sign
Pippen. And they subsequently needed to sign Pippen so they could
sign their own free agents as Larry Bird exceptions to the salary
cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to sign until next week,'' Barkley said. ``I
didn't want to go through two-a-days. The season is not going to be
won in February or March. It's going to be won in April, May and
June, maybe even July. I wasn't going to sign. I was going to stay
and play golf. Once I realized they could not sign Scottie without
me on the dotted line first, I went ahead and did it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did the Rockets a great favor, but they did a lot for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, however, said he never doubted Barkley would be with the
Rockets if he was. Had Pippen agreed to _ and in fact, orchestrated
_ the deal that delivered him to the Rockets and Barkley not
returned, he would have had some explaining to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a lot of influence on my decision (to come to
Houston),'' Pippen said. ``Knowing that he was going to be back,
and having Hakeem here, that's two of the top players in the game
right now. I realized the need that they (the Rockets) had for a
small forward, and having them say that they would like for me to
come here, that meant a lot. Not just Charles but Hakeem as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles is one who is always trying to keep you on the edge.
He pretty much gave me his word that if I came here, he would come
back. I kind of took him at that (his word).''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley just didn't say when he would come back. But once he
joined practice two days later than the rest of the team, he
couldn't help but wonder if he was still too early. As he sweated
and stretched, a few more days of snap-hooks and laughing golfers
sounded pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never have enough golf,'' Barkley said. ``Compare golf to
two-a-days. It's no contest.''

 &HT;    Romanowski a man for all downs
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Bill Romanowski has a well-cultivated persona as one of
the NFL's most notorious cheap-shot artists, which helps obscure
the fact that he's a good linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   The indiscretions have been well-publicized _ he spit in the
face of San Francisco 49ers wide receiver J.J. Stokes, smashed
then-Carolina Panthers quarterback Kerry Collins' jawbone and
taunted Kordell Stewart after the Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback
threw an interception in the 1997 AFC Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   Romanowski is not threatening Mensa territory, as one national
publication pointed out a few years ago, but he's a player who
figures prominently in the Denver Broncos plans for slowing the
Atlanta Falcons running game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game, you get his best shot,'' Broncos coach Mike
Shanahan said. ``The game means everything, and you can tell that
from the way that he prepares every week. It's not (coincidence)
he's involved in so many big plays.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to winning Sunday, however, might be Romanowski's
involvement in most of the small plays as well.
</P>
<P>
   An 11-year veteran, Romanowski prefers to think of himself as a
``third-down'' player, a defender who is on the field every snap.
Because he plays in every situation, he has 23 sacks, 12
interceptions, 51 passes defensed, 13 fumble recoveries and 15
forced fumbles in his career. But his chances of authoring a
significant play on third down Sunday could hinge on how stout
Romanowski is in shedding blocks and locating tailback Jamal
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like most teams, it all starts with the running game for
Atlanta,'' Romanowski said. ``They have a great running back, and
their line is coming hard off the ball. We can't let Anderson get
on a roll, because then the Falcons start dictating to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he plays the strong side, the perception is that
Romanowski plays better when roaming. But he must anchor the
outside against Anderson and probably will spend much of the game
matched against tight end O.J. Santiago or fullback Brian
Kozlowski.
</P>
<P>
   When asked Monday about Santiago, Romanowski said the
second-year pro is ``a big, strong athlete'' then elaborated mostly
about the tight end's abilities as a receiver. While a willing
blocker, Santiago is hardly a polished one. And as a replacement
for injured fullback Bob Christian, out since December with a knee
injury, Kozlowski has not been as decisive as a blocker.
</P>
<P>
   Whomever has the responsibility of blocking Romanowski, who
calls the defensive sets for coordinator Greg Robinson, might have
to equal his intensity for the Falcons to be able to run on the
strong side. ``He's incredibly active,'' Robinson said. ``If you
don't sustain (the block) and hang with him, he's going to play off
it and get into the middle of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota linebacker Dixon Edwards had early success last week
``dogging'' the line of scrimmage when the Falcons aligned in slot
formations. The failure to do a better job against Romanowski will
allow him to be a factor against the run.

BRADLEY EXPLORES PRESIDENTIAL RUN IN N.H. 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N. H. _ Former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley, his
voice barely audible, declared Monday that he would make a better
president than the Democratic front-runner, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bradley said, he's campaigning on his own
merits. ``In this campaign, I'm not really running against Al
Gore,'' Bradley insisted. ``I'm running because of what I want to
do with the country and for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the day marked his first visit to the
first-in-the-nation primary state since forming his presidential
exploratory committee, Bradley kept his audiences straining to hear
him, and he left them waiting for details of an agenda that never
came. Bradley, 55, said he is introducing himself to voters and
listening to what they have to say at this stage in the primary
process.
</P>
<P>
   In Keene, Bradley visited MonadNet, a community Internet service
provider. As he spoke to employees and visitors, he said next to
nothing about his agenda. Instead, he gave the crowd a thumbnail
sketch of himself, talking about his small-town roots growing up on
the banks of the Mississippi, in Crystal City, Mo., population
3,492.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be back to continue that story in the months ahead,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Manchester, Bradley sat down with a group of young people who
were trying to improve their lives, get an education, and learn a
marketable skill such as construction at Youthbuild. The session
was like an episode of ``Oprah,'' with Bradley playing the
moderator.
</P>
<P>
   The senator asked the teenagers to tell him something about
themselves, to tell him about their greatest fear and their
greatest hope. ``I know it's awkward,'' he said, prodding them in
front of the media.
</P>
<P>
   For Carmen Velazquez, 17 and pregnant, the moment proved too
much. She said that her hope was to become a photographer, and that
Youthbuild was a way to escape drugs and change her life.
</P>
<P>
   With that, Velazquez put her hand over her eyes and began to
sob. ``It's OK,'' Bradley told her, reaching out to pat her arm.
</P>
<P>
   The students asked Bradley about his positions on raising the
minimum wage, affirmative action, and taxes. He said he would raise
the minimum wage, but he hadn't decided by how much. He said he
supports affirmative action efforts, and he did not believe it
necessary to raise taxes in order to lower the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   To reporters, Bradley said there was no reason for him not to
challenge Gore, despite Gore's head start in organizing and
fund-raising. Bradley said that he has not been a part of the
partisanship of the last couple of years in Washington and that he
would be better able to attract independent and Republican voters
in a general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a chance of getting enough people to win in New
Hampshire, or I wouldn't be here,'' he said. While he said he would
reach out to established political leaders here and financial
donors throughout the country, Bradley said he does not have to
look to the same narrow group of people to whom Gore is going for
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country is very big,'' Bradley said. ``There are a lot of
people in America and in New Hampshire who haven't been politically
active.''
</P>
<P>
   But Joe Keefe, a leader in the Gore New Hampshire operation,
said Bradley would have to be more specific to have any
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bill Bradley is going to challenege the vice president for
the nomination, he has to demonstrate what ideas and policies he
would promote and how he would have done things differently the
last several years,'' said Keefe, a businessman and political
activist.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the people who came out to listen to Bradley said they
were looking for an alternative to Gore. Currently, Bradley is the
only other Democrat running. Senator John F. Kerry is still trying
to make up his mind about whether to run.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hodes, a Concord attorney, said one of the most compelling
reasons for him to support Bradley is ``the fact that he is not
connected to the current administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodes said Gore is not as adept at distracting voters from
campaign finance scandals and other problems as President Clinton
has been. He said Bradley's integrity is beyond reproach. ``I'm
tired of having to deal with issues of personal politics,'' Hodes
said.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ It was quite a shock the day that Werner
Merzbacher's babies left his home in Zurich for the Holy Land. All
at once, exposing vast expanses of wall, they were gone: the Monet,
the van Gogh, the Toulouse-Lautrec, the Matisse, the Modigliani,
the Picasso, the six Klees, the seven Kandinskys, the 10 Alexei von
Jawlenskys.
</P>
<P>
   Never before had they left home all at once, or traveled without
the cloak of anonymity. With 139 paintings and sculptures, the
Merzbacher collection, one of the world's finest private holdings
of modern art, was flying off to go public for the first time, at
the Israel Museum here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had prepared myself for their departure,'' Merzbacher, 70,
said by telephone from his house in Zurich, where an overabundance
of flowers was trying hard to compensate for the missing Fauves.
``But it does feel very empty without them. They are very close to
my soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Merzbacher's loss, which went beyond the temporary departure of
his artworks to the more lasting sacrifice of his anonymity, was
the Israel Museum's gain. It was a genuine coup for Jerusalem to
land the premiere of a collection that curators around the world
have lusted after. And it has proved a bonanza for a museum whose
attendance had declined with the drop in tourism to Israel due to
political instability.
</P>
<P>
   Almost since the October opening of the exhibition of his
paintings _ titled ``The Joy of Color'' _ Israelis have waited
patiently in line, an accomplishment in itself, for more than an
hour to gain entry. By the time the show closes in mid-February, it
is expected to break the 36-year-old museum's attendance records,
with some 225,000 visitors, including many repeat viewers. For
Israelis, the show has been a tonic, a refuge from the ugliness of
the political strife that engulfs their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like taking a warm bath in beauty,'' said Meirav Steiner,
a student.
</P>
<P>
   As culled and presented by the curator, Stephanie Rachum, the
show traces the history of color in 20th-century art with a
coherence that was both a revelation and relief to Merzbacher. The
paintings are accessible and luxurious, but it is clear that
visitors are drawn in as much by the story behind the collection as
by the works themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty impossible to go through this show without
thinking, `My God, can you imagine living with all this?''' said
James Snyder, the Israel Museum's director, a former deputy
director of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. ``And the
Merzbachers don't have a large house, by American standards. They
have paintings stacked two and three high, double and triple hung,
propped on the floor in the foyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Merzbacher, a furrier and international currency trader, and his
wife, Gabrielle, have lent individual works of art for years,
particularly to shows on the Fauves and the German Expressionists.
But for privacy and security, the works were always displayed with
the label ``Private property _ Switzerland.'' Because they
generally bought the art anonymously, too, by phoning their bids to
auctions, the couple were known only to a rarefied circle of
curators, modern art scholars, dealers and other big-time
collectors. They resisted every overture to mount an exhibition of
their full collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Werner's mind, it wasn't ever ready to be shown yet,''
Rachum said. ``It wasn't perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   If not perfect, it has long been considered a formidable
collection by the art world. Henry Wyndham, the chairman of
Sotheby's Europe, based in London, said: ``I've never seen anything
quite like it. Not only is the quality of particularly high
standard, but the quantity is extraordinary. It is without a doubt
one of the very finest private collections of modern art in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   About a decade ago Merzbacher's philanthropic relationship with
the Israel Museum began, and six years ago Rachum persuaded him to
make a commitment to show his collection this year, for his 70th
birthday and Israel's 50th.

JERUSALEM: Israel's 50th. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I only did it to help the Israel Museum and because I had
promised Stephanie,'' Merzbacher said.
</P>
<P>
   Like many in the small Swiss Jewish community, Merzbacher, who
described himself as ``not religious and from the left wing of
Judaism,'' said he felt a strong tie to Israel based on his
personal history. Born in Germany, Merzbacher was sent to
Switzerland by his parents in a children's transport in 1938 when
he was 10. He never saw his parents again; they died at Auschwitz.
For a decade he took shelter with a Christian Swiss family. Far
from the art world, he possessed nothing: no family, no money, no
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have very few memories of my childhood,'' he said. ``It's
like I pushed them out of my mind. My brother couldn't. He became
mentally ill. I think I was born with an optimistic character. I
coped, and in later life I embraced the positive through art. You
will find nothing dark or tortured or introverted in this
collection: no Dali, no de Chirico, no Bacon, no Freud.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war Merzbacher emigrated to the United States, where
he married into both the fur business and an art collection. His
wife had grown up surrounded by the small collection of modern
masterpieces that belonged to her grandfather, Bernhard Mayer. But
for Merzbacher, the notion of possessing such art was a marvel. Two
paintings in particular _ a Blue Period Picasso and a Matisse, both
in the show _ shaped his esthetic, he said, and set a very high
standard for what he would collect.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Merzbachers began with what they could afford,
Mexican and Italian social realists, most of which now live in
storage. Although they moved back to Switzerland in the 1960s, they
educated themselves at museums and galleries, particularly in New
York, and Merzbacher felt especially drawn to the bold colors and
dynamism of the Fauves, the German Expressionists and the Russian
avant-garde.
</P>
<P>
   From the start he would fix a painting in his sights and track
it until he could find it or afford it, even decades later. His was
not an intellectual but a passionate approach to art; he trusted
his gut. And he relished the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing an exhibition of Kandinsky's paintings at the
Leonard Hutton Galleries in Manhattan in the early 1960s, he put
that Russian-born artist at the top of his wish list. And
eventually, years later, he acquired seven Kandinskys, one by one,
from a critical point in his career. Viewed together, the oil
paintings seem to show Kandinsky's movement from landscapes to
abstraction.
</P>
<P>
   But each Kandinsky painting was like a slippery eel that got
away just as he pounced. One, ``Section for Composition II,'' was
repeatedly put on the market and snatched back by an indecisive
owner. Seven years after Merzbacher first tried to buy it, it
appeared on the cover of an auction catalog.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Oh, this time I really want to get it,' but the
owner changed his mind again,'' Merzbacher said. ``The auction
house told him he couldn't; it was on their cover. So they put a
very high limit and thought they wouldn't sell it. But I wanted it.
For me it is not a mental difficulty to pay more than the market
value for something I really want.''
</P>
<P>
   This was in the late 1970s, before art prices skyrocketed, and
Merzbacher said he paid $1 million. ``You wouldn't be seeing this
exhibition if money was what was important,'' Merzbacher said. ``I
have never bought art for money. I'm not displeased that it has not
been a terrible investment, but that was not my motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Lash, the vice chairman of Christie's, called Merzbacher
``a collector's collector, whose collection bears the unmistakable
imprint of the man himself.''
</P>
<P>
   That collection is estimated to be worth several hundred million
dollars. (A Modigliani similar to his ``Jeanne Hebuterne Sitting''
recently sold for $13 million.) He has not sold a painting in more
than 20 years. Of all the works he coveted, he has never been able
to acquire one of Miro's ``Constellations,'' and does not expect to
``in this lifetime,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Merzbacher never expected their shared interest to blossom
into a full-fledged obsession for her husband, wherein, as he said,
``every painting I feel close to, I try to obtain, if I can afford
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife is very interested, but she would have stopped a long,
long time ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Merzbacher said, ``I'm saturated.''
</P>
<P>
   Merzbacher collects auction catalogs from around the world and
keeps abreast of all important estate sales. He has never had an
agent, adviser or curator. But being a furrier trained his eye to
appreciate art, he said, especially subtle gradations of color.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my trade you need a strong sense of color,'' he said.
``Where you may see just a brown mink coat, I see something bluish
or brownish or reddish.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is color that links the Kandinskys, a luminescent group
of Klees, the brilliant watercolors of Emil Nolde, the engaging
figures of Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, a very saturated geometric
landscape by Franz Marc, a primitive boating scene by the Russian
avant-gardist Natalya Goncharova and a lush, prismatic oil painting
by the Surrealist Max Ernst.
</P>
<P>
   These are at the heart of the exhibition, but it also includes a
substantial representation of post-World War II paintings and
sculptures that many viewers found to be less than overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Werner's interested in what color does on the canvas, and
until World War II color is pretty central,'' Snyder said.
``Afterward, and you can tell by looking at what he has, color in a
way becomes secondary.''
</P>
<P>
   On a quick trip to Israel last week, the Merzbachers visited the
museum, charming Israeli viewers by apologizing for their wait on
line and the crowd inside the exhibition. Merzbacher was treated as
a national hero; people thanked him, again and again, with tears in
their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The Israel Museum has not yet dared to speak with Merzbacher
about the future of his collection. Asked whether his three
children were following in his footsteps as a collector, he said
that only his middle daughter showed any interest in the art. An
older daughter is a socialist who has long been embarrassed by her
father's private ownership of such a collection, he said; for
years, she would not bring any of her friends home.
</P>
<P>
   When the collection comes off the museum's walls here, it will
return to Switzerland. Merzbacher has turned down entreaties from
museums in Germany and Austria, agreeing only to lend a part of the
collection to Japan for an exhibition in 2001. But groups of
paintings will continue to travel to specific shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our one real puzzle is, can we go back to being anonymous?''
Merzbacher said.

 &HT;    Veterans keep teammates in check
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The Atlanta Falcons were out and about again Monday
night, cavorting on South Beach and looking like anything but a
team six days away from playing the most important game in the
33-year history of the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   But several players say fans back home shouldn't worry about
them lacking focus or failing to adequately prepare for Super Bowl
XXXIII against the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday and Monday are meant to be nights on the town the week
before the Super Bowl, and coach Dan Reeves intentionally imposed
no curfew on his squads the first two days in town.
</P>
<P>
   But things will be very different tonight, when a midnight
curfew goes into effect. In fact, the tone will begin shifting
today when the team goes over the official game plan in meetings
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely going to change (today) after curfew kicks
in,'' wide receiver Tony Martin said. ``Then, it's strictly
business. Like I said before, this is a business trip. When we get
that game plan tomorrow, guys will really start to focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Chuck Smith was having as much fun as anybody the
last two nights. That's about to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week in Atlanta, a few of us went out to show fans our
appreciation, but . . . we're not going to be like first-year
fools, hanging out on South Beach,'' he said. ``You can't win this
game by hanging out on South Beach. You can't win this game by
accommodating every interview. You can't win this game by being at
every party.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't play this game this week and be dehydrated from
drinking. You have to do like we did all year. We weren't a big
party team.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the team's arrival, linebacker Cornelius Bennett and
free safety Eugene Robinson were lecturing teammates on the evils
of running the streets the week of the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   They were reminding everybody again Monday and Tuesday, Bennett
saying he partied it up with the Bills on the way to losing four
Super Bowls and Robinson talking of how important it was in Green
Bay's Super Bowl XXXI win over New England that his team wasn't
staying out as late as the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got guys on this team who have been to the Super Bowl _
two vocal guys, who like to talk at practice,'' cornerback Ray
Buchanan said. ``They can keep guys focused . . . during the week
to where we don't have any distractions.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves doesn't seem worried, at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always understood we've got to prepare just right, and
play well to win,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said his teammates have their priorities straight, but the
midnight curfew and bedcheck at the team hotel will be the perfect
safeguard.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you do before 12? In Atlanta, you don't even go out
until 1 a.m.,'' he said. ``Besides, we got a lot of married guys on
this team. This is not a big party team. We don't have many single
guys. Me, (running back) Jamal (Anderson) and (left tackle) Bob
(Whitfield) are single, but you know we're not going to do anything
to jeopardize this game.''

JOHN PAUL SEES PROMISE, PERIL IN US 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Perhaps no other country in the world frustrates
Pope John Paul II more than the globe's last remaining superpower,
papal observers say.
</P>
<P>
   And as the 78-year-old pontiff arrives in St. Louis Tuesday for
a two-day visit _ during which he will see President Clinton
privately at the airport and attend a youth rally _ John Paul will
undoubtedly both extol and scold a nation he sees as full of
promise and peril.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, the United States and the pope have been on the
same side in the historic struggle to tear down Communism and bring
democratic values and freedom to once-oppressed lands.
</P>
<P>
   On the other, the United States, with 62 million Roman
Catholics, is the biggest obstacle in John Paul's relentless quest
to plant a vision of society that is more humane, more egalitarian,
and more spiritual.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with the Gospel, he comes to the country that embodies
some of the traits he has said are most alarming in the world _ a
selfish pursuit of wealth, individualism without responsibility,
and a media culture saturated with violence and sex.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has said that a society without a moral anchor runs the
danger of reducing human beings to mere objects without value.
That's a key reason why, in the pope's view, the United States
seems to be so accepting of abortion, the death penalty, and a
economic system that leaves so many mired in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States probably causes the pope more pain than
anyplace else because it is the greatest threat to the church's
authority and the church's mission, as John Paul sees it,'' said
Brian Smith, a religion professor at Ripon College in Ripon, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest concerns of his papacy is the fact that the
United States seems so distant from the ethical principles the pope
fervently promotes,'' he said. ``One message, I think, he'll bring
is that the US has a deep responsibility to be a model to the
world, and it's not doing a good job of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The fundamental problem, many religion scholars say, is that
there is an enormous chasm of understanding between the Vatican and
a vast segment of Catholics in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two competing views clashing here _ one's conscience
versus church teaching,'' said William D'Antonio, adjunct professor
of sociology at Catholic University in Washington, who has
conducted several surveys of American Catholics revealing how far
apart they are from the Vatican on issues ranging from divorce to
married priests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our conscience is the use of our reason to understand issues
around us and to make judgments about them,'' D'Antonio added.
``John Paul, however, says we should look to the church's teaching
authority to help shape our conscience. In this country Catholics
are following their conscience, and their conscience doesn't
automatically make them agree with the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, Thomas Aquinas believed it was better to die
excommunicated than to violate one's conscience. And the Second
Vatican Council seemed to suggest the primacy of conscience, but
the issue is far from resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Favazza, a professor of religious studies at Rhodes College
in Memphis, said, ``In a certain way, the pope sees the idea of
people thinking for themselves as a threat to the unity of the
church.''
</P>
<P>
   To many American Catholics, John Paul is an endearing
grandfather figure who is out of step with society. Many here
regard him as the unyielding leader of a 2,000-year-old patriarchal
and authoritarian institution.
</P>
<P>
   After 20 years and five visits to the United States, John Paul's
repeated exhortations to Catholics to be more loyal to the church
mirrors a growing gap between the Vatican and American Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Periodic surveys conducted between 1970 and 1993 show a decrease
in the percentage of American Catholics agreeing with the church's
positions on such controversial issues as women priests, birth
control, and even abortion, said Ruth Wallace, a professor of
sociology at George Washington University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Even among committed Catholics, those who go to Mass every week
and who say they would never abandon the church, less than
one-third said in a recent survey that moral authority comes solely
from Catholic leaders, according to D'Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's views on church authority, scholars say, were shaped
by his experiences in his native Poland and were influenced by the
world of Roman Catholicism before the Second Vatican Council
attempted to strengthen the voice of lay Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He comes from a tradition where church authority is to be
respected and if there is dissent it should be done quietly behind
closed doors,'' Smith said. ``But in the United States we have all
these Catholic groups openly dissenting.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope's defenders say if John Paul had been influenced by
surveys and demonstrations he long would have given up on the
United States. Instead, they expect him to use what may be his last
visit here to once again hammer home themes close to his heart _
respect for life, responsibility to the poor, and reverence for the
church _ no matter how they are received.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Holy Father has a much more long-term view of things,''
said the Rev. Matthew Lamb, a professor of theology at Boston
College. ``It may take a long time to change the culture, but as
the Apostle Paul wrote, you have to preach the Gospel in season and
out of season.''

WITNESS ISSUE IS STILL THE STICKING POINT

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By the time Republicans senators trickled into
their 10 a.m. meeting Monday, the stage had been set and the script
had been written for a way to end the impeachment trial of
President Clinton, possibly in a matter of days.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Monica Lewinsky had come to town, setting off
agitated scrums of reporters and gawkers that foretold the
commotion if she were to testify in the Senate. Partisan tempers
had flared, reminding senators that their hold on dignity was
tenuous.
</P>
<P>
   And two trusted ambassadors of bipartisanship _ Sen. Slade
Gorton, R-Wash., and Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn. _ had sketched
a scenario for a denouement, passing the plan on to party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But that glimmer of hope died quickly in the Republican caucus
Monday, and the reason boiled down to the same sticking point that
had proven most vexing from the outset of the proceedings: namely,
witnesses. The Gorton-Lieberman plan did not allow for them, and
many Republicans remained steadfast in their desire to call at
least a few.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard for me to envision, as a trier of fact who has
taken an oath, judging this case without seeing the most important
witness or witnesses,'' said Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, after his
party's two-hour caucus Monday. ``It is not so much a question of,
`Will this witness testify to new things?' The issue is for the
fact finder to have the full benefit of the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican determination, in the face of all the temptations
to wriggle free of the proceedings, can be traced to a variety of
factors, including a sense of obligation to give the House trial
managers their due, an antipathy to letting the president off easy
and lingering questions about some of the facts laid out in the
voluminous record of the case.
</P>
<P>
   But above all, Republican senators who continue _ at least
publicly _ to insist on witnesses cite history as the prime
motivation. They say that no previous Senate impeachment trial
bypassed witnesses on the way to a verdict, and if this one did so,
it would send the lawmakers of tomorrow the wrong message.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be setting a very bad precedent,'' Sen. Charles
Grassley, R-Iowa, said Monday, echoing an opinion that several of
his Republican colleagues had stated on televised news programs
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley explained that truncating an impeachment trial and
skipping over traditional legal steps might rob it of some gravity,
so that in the future, impeachment itself might seem a paltry
thing, easily remedied by an accelerated Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might even encourage impeachment,'' he said, ``and lend to
a political adversarial use of impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   With so much in flux Monday, it was possible that some
Republicans' hard line on the inclusion of witnesses _ or at least
a vote on their inclusion _ was a continued bargaining position, a
chip they were not quite ready to hand over to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   From certain perspectives, the tenacity of the Republican demand
for witnesses is extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   It has political peril, a reality hammered home by successive
public opinion polls in which most Americans say they want the
trial over and done with. It defies the fact that Miss Lewinsky
this weekend indicated that she had nothing new to say, and it
seemingly ignores the unwillingness of other potential witnesses,
such as Betty Currie and Vernon Jordan, to say or do anything to
hurt Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some Democrats wonder if the desire for witnesses
is simply spiteful, or a delusion among conservative Republicans
who refuse to concede that Clinton has transcended his travails yet
again. These Democrats also contend that many Republican senators
are beholden to right-wing constituents who demand a ferocious
prosecution of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Neb., said Monday that some Republicans were
apparently hoping that ``under the glare and the pressure and this
and that, some witness may contradict what he or she said before.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some Republicans like Grassley, who want witnesses have
said they are merely interested in having witnesses deposed
privately before a final decision on their testimony is made.
Others may feel it is the vote on witnesses _ not their actual
testimony of them _ that is paramount.
</P>
<P>
   The Gorton-Lieberman plan did away with that vote. It presented
a tit-for-tat compromise, with Democrats offering not to introduce
a motion to dismiss the charges against Clinton if Republicans
agreed to skip the witness vote and go directly to final arguments
and a vote on the articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But some Republicans said Monday that there were ways in which
depositions or other testimony from witnesses could clarify muddy
facts, particularly in relation to the second article, which
charges Clinton with obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Prior statements from Ms. Currie and Miss Lewinsky, for example,
contain discrepancies about whether Ms. Currie directed Miss
Lewinsky to dispose of gifts the president had given her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we want to get every clarification we can get to
make a severe judgment,'' Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, several of the House Republicans appointed to
prosecute the president, or trial managers, have repeatedly pleaded
with Republicans in the Senate to give them at least a limited
opportunity to buttress their case with the questioning of
witnesses. Some Republican senators have been moved by those
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Craig Thomas, R-Wyo., said Monday that it was only fair and
respectful to try to accommodate the managers. ``We would do the
same for the president's lawyers,'' he said.

 &HT;    EDS: with JASPER-MAIN-COX
 &HT;    Most Jasper, Texas, residents avoiding talk of the murder trial
 &HT;    By Zach Maxwell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ When the fog cleared on this tormented town
Monday, another page had turned in the darkest chapter of Jasper's
history.
</P>
<P>
   But as the first of the biggest trials ever to hit East Texas
began, people were mostly avoiding the subject as those in the
courthouse in the middle of downtown sought justice and closure.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of local residents who weren't summoned for jury
duty bothered to join the throng of reporters and cameras that
swirled around the courthouse. Construction workers kept their
focus on expanding and improving the infamous gazebo on the
northwest lawn. And the Jasper Chamber of Commerce set up a booth,
offering water and maps to media members, on the courthouse lawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of good people around here,'' said Allen
DeFriend, 31, a Kirbyville college student and thus one of the
first dismissed jurors. ``Now, people assume Jasper is full of
racist rednecks. But it's not. There are bad apples everywhere you
go.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole family is from around here. Nobody wants to get
involved. It leaves a bad taste in your mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Downtown Merchants Association, many of whose members have
businesses facing the courthouse and Monday's media throng, has
decided to steer clear of the subject, which one shopkeeper deemed
a ``disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   But the chamber of commerce was doling out free water from one
of Jasper's newest business ventures, along with promoting the area
as a tourist's delight. And no one is complaining about a second
round of sold-out lodging and dozens of hungry out-of-town
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Officials admit security is still a concern, bringing back last
June's images of armed protesters taking to Jasper streets, or the
visits from white supremacist groups that sparked a wave of anger
from local residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not used to this. It's not normally like this,'' Jasper
County Constable Ralph Nichols said. ``No matter who is here, we
want them to be safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Nichols felt threatened Monday morning _ not from armed
protesters, but from a pack of cameramen and reporters locked out
of the trial's proceedings. Only a handful of reporters _ and no
cameras _ are being allowed inside for the jury selection phase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had cameras stuck in our face all the time (during
summer),'' he said. ``Of course it makes you feel uneasy.''
</P>
<P>
   Burkeville resident Willie Rhodes came to the courthouse Monday
out of curiosity. Like others, he wants to see the dark chapter
end, ``as long as there's justice.''

CLINTON TO ATTEND FUND-RAISERS IN BOSTON

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, in his first trip to New England
since he was impeached, will visit Boston next week to tout his
education proposals and attend two fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to spend several hours next Tuesday in
Boston, then head to New York, where he will attend a third
function, a $10,000-a-plate Democratic National Committee dinner at
Le Cirque 2000.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, the time and location for Clinton's education
speech had not been set, White House aides said. But they said the
president will reiterate the plan, outlined in his State of the
Union address last week, to bring more accountability to states and
school districts for the performance of their students.
</P>
<P>
   The president will visit Boston the day after he formally
presents his fiscal 2000 budget to Congress. He typically travels
to rally support for his budget priorities the day after he sends
his budget to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   While in Boston, Clinton will attend a $10,000-a-plate luncheon
at the Park Plaza Hotel in honor of Steve Grossman, a Newton, Mass.
businessman who announced last month he was stepping down as
chairman of the Democratic National Committee. A $250-per-person
reception will follow for activists and organizers who have worked
with Grossman, who also is a former chairman of the Massachusetts
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds from the events in Boston and New York will help
finance Democratic candidates in 2000, party officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the Boston event include Mayor Thomas M. Menino,
former DNC financial chairman Alan Solomont of Weston, Mass. and
Democratic activist Elaine Schuster of Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   While the organizers are promising to spring some surprises on
Grossman at the fund-raiser, it's unlikely that one of them will be
an announcement by Clinton that the DNC has chosen Boston to host
the party's 2000 national convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of people would be very happy'' if Clinton did
make such an announcement, Solomont said Monday. ``There's no
question that Boston is a contender, a very serious contender, and
the convention may well be in Boston, and if it is, the credit goes
to the great job the mayor did in helping us put our best foot
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston is competing against Los Angeles, widely considered the
front-runner for the convention, and Denver. DNC officials say they
expect to announce their decision on a convention site in late
February or early March.

<P>
   So why the furor? Why have coaches and players from both sides
been moved to comment on Buchanan's assertion that his team will,
uh, win?
</P>
<P>
   Because he said the magic word.
</P>
<P>
   He said ``guarantee.''
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl started to become a Major Deal in 1969, when the
AFL's Jets beat the NFL's much-fancied Colts in this very city. The
Jets' epochal upset was fueled by Joe Willie Namath's guarantee of
victory. (History records that Joe Willie had a glass of Scotch in
his hand when he spoke.)
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by Cris Collinsworth on HBO for a similar pronouncement,
Buchanan at first demurred. Then he obliged, actually saying,
``What the heck.'' And boy, howdy, you'd have thought Big-Play Ray
had called Mickey Mouse a rodent. Mike Shananan said Buchanan will
have to live with his words. Borrowing Joe Willie's nickname, Dan
Reeves dubbed his cornerback ``Broadway Ray.'' Four days later, the
guarantee rages on. Did Buchanan mean it? Does he regret it? Does
he plan on shutting up?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was for fun,'' Buchanan said. ``It's for the media. But the
guarantee is a confidence thing, and that's what you want to have.
Sometimes you can't speak for a whole football team, but we believe
we can win this game. If you can't stand on faith, you shouldn't
even go out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Already Buchanan has run into a few Broncos out and about. His
report: ``We joked about it.'' (History also notes that,
post-guarantee, the Colts' Lou Michaels wanted to throttle Joe
Willie in a nightclub.) Buchanan again: ``It wasn't meant as a slap
in Denver's face.''
</P>
<P>
   Overlooked in the guarantee's wake was that, on that same HBO
show, NFL Films had a clip of the Vikings' Randy Moss telling
Dennis Green: ``That Ray Buchanan can't cover me!'' Moss caught one
pass for four yards after halftime in the NFC championship game,
Buchanan batting away a third-down throw in overtime. For receivers
and the cornerbacks who must cover them, bravado is standard
equipment, same as hip pads.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to understand where I live on the football field,''
Buchanan said. ``I'm out there on an island, and sometimes I'll say
what I want. . . . If you're in a boxing ring, you're not going to
back down from a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons wouldn't be here if they hadn't dared to rise above
their forlorn station. As Buchanan said, ``Before Dan Reeves,
people at our games would buy hot dogs to go.'' Had the Falcons not
believed they were better than anyone else dreamed, they wouldn't
have forged past San Francisco to win the West, wouldn't have
overhauled mighty Minnesota in the Metrodome. And now comes Denver,
favored by a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't come here to lose,'' Buchanan said. ``There's only
one way to feel, and that's that we're going to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone noted that, while every opponent seeks to shackle the
Broncos' Terrell Davis, none really has. Said Broadway Ray,
blithely: ``They haven't played the Atlanta Falcons yet.''

<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ If there had been any doubt, Jasper County
District Attorney Guy James Gray removed it Monday: James Byrd Jr.
was alive and conscious when he was chained by his ankles to a
pickup and dragged to his death that night in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was using his elbows and his body in every manner that he
could to keep his head and shoulders away from the pavement,'' Gray
told 122 prospective jurors on the first day of the capital murder
trial of John William ``Bill'' King.
</P>
<P>
   King, a white supremacist and former member of a racist prison
gang, is the first of three men to be tried for allegedly killing
the 49-year-old Byrd because he was black.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of capital murder _ which would mean the jury
believes King both kidnapped and killed Byrd _ the 24-year-old
Jasper native would automatically face the death penalty or a life
prison sentence. The latter would require him to serve at least 40
years before being eligible for parole.
</P>
<P>
   King denies killing Byrd, but admits he was present when Byrd
was picked up as he was walking home from a party in the early
hours of June 7. Byrd's dismembered body was found the next morning
in the middle of Huff Creek Road, near an old African-American
cemetery. His head and right arm lay in a ditch about a mile down
the road. Prosecutors say Byrd's blood was found on the shoes of
all three suspects.
</P>
<P>
   King's high school buddy, Shawn Allen Berry, and former prison
cellmate, Lawrence Russell Brewer Jr., will face separate capital
murder trials later. Prosecutors are also seeking the death penalty
for Berry, 23, of Jasper, and Brewer, 31, of Sulphur Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Gray told prospective jurors that Byrd's killers could have left
his body on a back road in the Piney Woods where it likely wouldn't
have been discovered for weeks or months. Instead, they left it in
front of the black cemetery ``as some form of a message.'' They
even stopped after Byrd, ``swinging out right and left like a boat
pulling a skier,'' was decapitated, he said. A pool of blood along
the three-mile trail indicated the killers had lingered before they
resumed dragging Byrd's body, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The jury pool, whittled from 203 after some failed to show up
and others were routinely excused, filled out a seven-page
questionnaire before being sent home shortly after noon CST.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to those who were excused, one 62-year-old potential
juror was arrested at the front door of the courthouse when an
officer searching her purse found a small caliber revolver. Imogene
Hopson of Jasper was charged with unlawful possession of a handgun
and released on $5,000 bond. She also was removed from the jury
pool.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper Police Chief Stanley Christopher said Hopson, who did not
have a permit to carry a concealed weapon, did not intend to harm
anyone. She told police she carried the gun for protection and
forgot it was in her purse.
</P>
<P>
   Seven prospective jurors will return Tuesday to be questioned
individually in what defense attorney Brack Jones called a ``job
interview'' to see who will be qualified to hear the case against
King. That process, with seven to 10 jurors reporting each day, is
expected to last about three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Once 12 jurors and two alternates are selected, the actual trial
will take six to eight working days, state District Judge Joe Bob
Golden estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning, as dozens of reporters and photographers
gathered on the courthouse square and the Chamber of Commerce
president sold maps and handed out free bottled water, King was
quickly ushered into a side door of the courthouse. He said
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in khaki slacks and a blue and white striped long-sleeve
shirt that covered a mosaic of racist tattoos, King sported a fresh
haircut and a cleanshaven face. He wore handcuffs and a
bullet-proof vest as he was transported from the county jail to the
courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Once he cleared the newly installed metal detectors and entered
the courthouse, which earlier had been swept by a bomb-sniffing
dog, King's cuffs and vest were removed. In the courtroom, he wore
an electronic stun belt beneath his shirt. The device, which can be
activated by the push of a button, can deliver a powerful shock of
electricity to the defendant's back if he should attempt to escape
during the trial. Two of the seven courtroom guards held the
controls.
</P>
<P>
   But King appeared calm, sitting at the defense table with his
hands clasped on the table and occasionally taking notes or
whispering to his attorneys. King watched Gray intently as the
prosecutor described the gruesome crime; several potential jurors
winced or covered their faces with their hands.
</P>
<P>
   When King's lead court-appointed attorney, C. Haden ``Sonny''
Cribbs Jr., later described execution by injection, it was King who
raised hands to his face or stared down at the table. Cribbs later
said his client was doing ``OK'' and indicated that he was
beginning to cooperate, despite a recent attempt to oust his
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Gray cautioned potential jurors to ignore media coverage of
Byrd's killing and gave several examples of reports he considered
erroneous or misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ``The paper says he's a white supremacist. The paper says he's
got tattoos,'' the prosecutor said. ``Now then, are we talking
about tattoos some 15-year-old boy got on his shoulder _ maybe a
Confederate flag, maybe three K's _ and now the man's 24 years old
... or are we talking about something else? You have to wait and
not prejudge him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably would be real easy to try this man out of hate,
anger, malice and all those kinds of things,'' he added, ``but it
wouldn't be right.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Gray asked jurors if any felt they couldn't set aside
what they've heard or read and judge King fairly, only one _ a
middle-aged white woman _ raised her hand. The only question from
the jury panel came from a black woman who asked if she would be
disqualified because she had been to the crime scene. Gray told her
that alone would not eliminate her from the jury pool, and said he
assumed many Jasper County residents had driven out Huff Creek Road
since Byrd's death.
</P>
<P>
   During his turn addressing the jury, Cribbs said, ``I'll tell
you up front: I don't believe in the death penalty.'' And he told
jurors they also had the right to oppose it, but should say so when
filling out their questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is by far the most important thing,'' he said. ``We're
not talking about money. We're talking about whether this young boy
lives or is executed.''

FAMILY STATUS ABOVE PAR IN BAY STATE, AGENCY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DORIS SUE WONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Compared to the nation as a whole, families in
Massachusetts are generally less likely to be poor, more likely to
have two parents, and enjoy greater access to health care,
according to a national survey released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Low-income families in the state, however, are having a harder
time coping financially and emotionally than their counterparts
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts families living below $31,822 for a family of four
had significantly higher rates of unemployment, more difficulty
paying rent, and greater levels of poor mental health and parental
stress.
</P>
<P>
   The Urban Institute, a nonpartisan research center, took the
survey of nearly 44,500 randomly selected families in 1997 to
provide a ``snapshot'' of family well-being in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Massachusetts on many measures does look better than the
national average, particularly in the area of health care,'' said
Alan Weil, director of the survey. ``But once you move from there,
there are significant problems among low-income families.''
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of families in the state have health insurance
and stable health care, regardless of their income. In addition,
children were more likely to engage in extracurricular activities
and have stories read to them by parents at least three times a
week.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found Massachusetts' parents of all income
levels had varying attitudes about welfare and work: They were less
likely than people in other states to believe that welfare
discouraged people from working; yet they were more likely to
believe that mothers could go to work without damaging their
relationships with their children.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts had a smaller percentage of families who were
low-income _ 22.5 percent compared to 33 percent nationally. But
low-income parents were more likely to be unemployed _ 41 percent
compared to 35 percent nationally _ and to report being ``highly
aggravated'' with their children _ nearly 21 percent compared to 14
percent nationally.
</P>
<P>
   And, in an odd paradox, the parental stress was worse among
low-income parents with spouses than without spouses.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for parents and the poor suggested the extra stress
may be an unforeseen consequences of Massachusetts' robust economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the economy is doing well and you read that others are
doing well and the welfare rolls are dropping, you have a sense you
are supposed to be doing well but you are not,'' said Jeannette
Atkinson, executive director of Parents Anonymous in Massachusetts.
``So who do you blame? Yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson added that married low-income parents may tend to feel
greater stress than poor unmarried parents because they also feel
the burden of trying to nudge spouses to provide support, both
emotionally and financially.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel lonely, yet this other person is there,'' she said.
``It makes the isolation feel greater or the problems feel
compounded.''
</P>
<P>
   Children and health advocates see Massachusetts' stricter
welfare rules and the state's relative inattention to mental health
coverage as contributing to the higher rates of psychological
problems among low-income parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a commitment on the part of the state to
address health care,'' which has made Massachusetts a leader in
medical coverage and access, said Robert Restuccia, director of
Health Care for All. But ``in this state there has been a tendency
to treat mental health as a poor stepsister. It is an area that
definitely needs more work.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the stress parents have felt, the survey results
indicate that so far at least they have had little impact on their
children, who reportedly have no greater emotional and behavioral
problems than all low-income children nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a pleasant surprise,'' said Atkinson.

 &HT;    Odd couple is teaming for `anti-Oprah' show
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boys will be boys. And likely nobody could be any more than
``Loveline's'' Adam Carolla and ``Win Ben Stein's Money's'' Jimmy
Kimmel.
</P>
<P>
   Surely you've seen them while surfing cable's unnetworklike
programming. Carolla is the male couch potato's most perfect
relationship therapist, practically belching his way through his
seat-of-the-pants wise guy advice for the lovelorn on MTV's
late-hour sex talk show ``Loveline.''
</P>
<P>
   And Kimmel, he's the smart-mouth juice always getting under
Stein's skin on Comedy Central's wickedly funny anti-``Jeopardy!''
quiz show.
</P>
<P>
   Starting June 16, Carolla and Kimmel will host Comedy Central's
new aptly named ``The Man Show.'' And as Comedy Central usually
does, it's promoting the show with sexist bravado.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anti-Oprah has arrived,'' Comedy Central's press release
announces. ``The Man Show'' will be a half-hour devoted to sketch
comedy, male philosophy, celebrities and ``large-breasted women.''
The cable network describes Carolla and Kimmel as ``real men _ men
who enjoy nothing more than watching chicks bounce on
trampolines.''
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't you know _ ``The Man Show'' will air immediately after
``South Park.''
</P>
<P>
   SEEN AND HEARD
</P>
<P>
   For NBC, a big claim
</P>
<P>
   NBC on Monday claimed its Sunday airing of ``The 56th Annual
Golden Globe Awards'' attracted more than 50 million viewers. That
number, however, is based on NBC's own analysis of measurable
in-home viewership data provided by Nielsen Media Research.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen's official total viewer count, however, will likely be
quite a few million less than that.
</P>
<P>
   For example, NBC says last year's Golden Globe awards show
attracted more than 49 million viewers, but official Nielsen total
viewer figures say only about 24.34 million people tuned in.

CLINTON TO ATTEND FUND-RAISERS IN BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, in his first trip to New England
since he was impeached, will visit Boston next week to tout his
education proposals and attend two fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to spend several hours next Tuesday in
Boston, then head to New York, where he will attend a third
function, a $10,000-a-plate Democratic National Committee dinner at
Le Cirque 2000.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, the time and location for Clinton's education
speech had not been set, White House aides said. But they said the
president will reiterate the plan, outlined in his State of the
Union address last week, to bring more accountability to states and
school districts for the performance of their students.
</P>
<P>
   The president will visit Boston the day after he formally
presents his fiscal 2000 budget to Congress. He typically travels
to rally support for his budget priorities the day after he sends
his budget to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   While in Boston, Clinton will attend a $10,000-a-plate luncheon
at the Park Plaza Hotel in honor of Steve Grossman, a Newton, Mass.
businessman who announced last month he was stepping down as
chairman of the Democratic National Committee. A $250-per-person
reception will follow for activists and organizers who have worked
with Grossman, who also is a former chairman of the Massachusetts
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds from the events in Boston and New York will help
finance Democratic candidates in 2000, party officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the Boston event include Mayor Thomas M. Menino,
former DNC financial chairman Alan Solomont of Weston, Mass. and
Democratic activist Elaine Schuster of Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   While the organizers are promising to spring some surprises on
Grossman at the fund-raiser, it's unlikely that one of them will be
an announcement by Clinton that the DNC has chosen Boston to host
the party's 2000 national convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of people would be very happy'' if Clinton did
make such an announcement, Solomont said Monday. ``There's no
question that Boston is a contender, a very serious contender, and
the convention may well be in Boston, and if it is, the credit goes
to the great job the mayor did in helping us put our best foot
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston is competing against Los Angeles, widely considered the
front-runner for the convention, and Denver. DNC officials say they
expect to announce their decision on a convention site in late
February or early March.

 &HT;    Setup key to power game
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Secure in the knowledge that the Atlanta Falcons had run
the ball an NFL-high 67.2 percent of the time on first-and-10
during the regular season, Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator
Foge Fazio set out in last Sunday's NFC title game to crowd the
line of scrimmage in those situations and reduce the impact of
Jamal Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Reading off three keys he noticed during videotape review, Fazio
brought linebacker Dixon Edwards and strong safety Robert Griffith
through the inside gaps or to the outside shoulder of Atlanta's
offensive tackles on many first-down plays.
</P>
<P>
   Fazio won initially, limiting the Falcons star tailback to 42
yards in regulation and 67 yards overall. ``But they crossed us up
after a while, and the complexion of the game really changed
quickly,'' Fazio said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Vikings lost eventually, when Falcons quarterback
Chris Chandler began to throw on first down, especially in the
final three quarters. Fazio and several league defensive
coordinators think Atlanta will enter the Super Bowl with a similar
strategy _ to throw early and set up the run off the pass.
</P>
<P>
   They pointed out that the Denver secondary, particularly in the
middle of the field, is extremely vulnerable. To a man, however,
the defensive coordinators insisted that Atlanta remains an
offensive team constructed around Anderson's ability to bludgeon a
defense into submission.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Falcons did last week was smart, but it was also a
little out of character for them,'' said New England's Steve
Sidwell, one of four coordinators to face both the Falcons and
Broncos in 1998. ``In big games, teams try to do what they do the
best. And the Falcons are a team that dictates to you with the
run.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson averaged 25.6 carries per game in the regular season
and has 52 attempts in the Falcons' two playoff victories. However,
the Denver defense has allowed a paltry 88 rushing yards in its
past four outings, and just 28 yards rushing in postseason
victories against Miami and the New York Jets. While they don't
play the same scheme, the Broncos are similar to the Falcons in
that they have a quick front seven that brings a lot of bodies to
the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Denver has been particularly effective on first down in the
playoffs, holding opponents to a minuscule 8 yards on 14 attempts,
an average of less than two feet per rush. As a result, the average
yards-to-make for opponents on third down has been nearly 8. During
the regular season, Atlanta netted 4 yards or more on about 40
percent of its first-down rushes and ranked No. 3 in the league
with 1,098 yards on first-down rushing plays. To claim its first
Super Bowl title, Atlanta must have that kind of success against
the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   One element the Falcons will use to counter Denver's penetration
is the ``hard count'' that Chandler uses to draw defensive linemen
offside. Early in the game, when both teams' emotions are high, a
few 5-yard ``gifts'' from the Broncos front seven could be an edge
for the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about an offensive rhythm, but you can't let a
defense get into a rhythm, either,'' said former NFL quarterback
Hugh Millen, a radio analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Because the physical matchups on the Denver defensive line and
the Atlanta offensive front seem to offer little advantage to
either team, the Broncos will try to read some of the same keys the
Vikings read for slowing Anderson. In the NFC Championship Game the
Falcons tailback appeared to be a step slow to the hole and broke
few tackles at the line of scrimmage, certainly understandable for
a runner who has carried the ball 462 times in 18 games.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, a five-year veteran, probably will have fresh legs
Sunday. If that's the case, the Broncos must stuff the inside
creases, especially on the ``iso-lead'' play, and force Anderson
laterally, where every runner loses momentum. Three keys that might
help the Broncos slow Anderson:
</P>
<P>
   _ When the Falcons flip wide receivers Terance Mathis and Tony
Martin to the same side of the formation, they typically run to the
weak side of the set, away from the slot. For passing situations,
such a formation limits blitz opportunities for a defense. But
because they knew Atlanta would run from this ``slot'' set, the
Vikings countered with some ``run-dogs'' and were successful. By
nature, the Broncos try to defend the run without bringing strong
safety Tyrone Braxton close to the line of scrimmage as an eighth
man. But identifying such an offensive tendency allows an opponent
to sometimes commit even nine defenders to the run. If there is a
defender unaccounted for in the blocking scheme, Anderson must
break some tackles.
</P>
<P>
   _ Anderson, who is left-handed, definitely prefers to cut back
to his left. ``If the play is to the left, he almost always stays
there,'' Fazio said. ``But when a play starts to the right, Jamal
is looking for that cutback lane as soon as he gets the ball. (Left
tackle) Bob Whitfield has become a solid run-blocker, but I don't
think it's a case of Anderson using him for a security blanket. He
just seems to be more comfortable going left.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Brian Kozlowski, who moved from tight end to fullback, isn't
as decisive a lead blocker as the injured Bob Christian was. So
Anderson will seek out the alternate hole more often than he did
before Christian injured his knee in December.
</P>
<P>
   Once again for the Falcons, the keys to establishing the run are
second-year left guard Calvin Collins and rookie right tackle
Ephraim Salaam. The Broncos' best run-stuffer inside is right
tackle Keith Traylor, a 304-pounder who has the ability to
neutralize the lead block and keep blockers off middle linebacker
Glenn Cadrez.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons running game vs. Broncos run defense
</P>
<P>
   Although they held the Dolphins and Jets to 14 yards each in the
playoffs, the Broncos will face a running back markedly different
from Miami's Karim Abdul-Jabbar and New York's Curtis Martin. While
he looked sluggish at times in the NFC Championship Game, Jamal
Anderson should have fresh legs in the Super Bowl. Denver might
slow Anderson, but if the Falcons throw early to set up the run,
he'll get his yards.
</P>
<P>
   Edge: Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday: Falcons pass vs. Broncos pass defense.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday: Broncos run vs. Falcons run defense.

JUSTICES RULE 2000 CENSUS CANNOT USE STATISTICAL SAMPLING METHODS
</HEADLINE>
   (See SCOTUS-FUNDRAISING; also SCOTUS-HUGHES, SCOTUS-LONG-DISTANCE,
moving in `f' category) 
(sw) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dealing a bitter blow to Democratic hopes, the
Supreme Court on Monday ruled that the official census for 2000,
which will be used to apportion seats in the House of
Representatives, must be conducted by the traditional head count.
</P>
<P>
   The court prohibited the statistical sampling that the Clinton
administration had planned to use to prevent millions of Americans
_ disproportionately urban, Democratic-leaning members of racial
and ethnic minority groups _ from being missed, as they were in the
last census.
</P>
<P>
   Giving some solace to the Democrats, however, the court drew a
distinction between the official census figures used to apportion
seats in the House of Representatives among the 50 states, and any
statistical adjustment of those figures for other purposes like
state redistricting and the distribution of federal money to the
states.
</P>
<P>
   While federal law bars sampling for apportionment, the court
said, it permits and perhaps even requires statistical adjustments
for the other purposes, an aspect of the decision that Democrats
hailed even while acknowledging that any plan for sampling, even a
truncated one, remained largely at the mercy of the Republican-led
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-4 decision, upholding a ruling last August by a special
three-judge Federal District Court panel in Richmond, Va., split
the court along ideological lines. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's
majority opinion, based on an interpretation of the federal law
governing the census, was joined by the court's four most
conservative members: Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas.
Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg,
and Stephen G. Breyer dissented.
</P>
<P>
   Census sampling is a gritty political issue and it produced a
gritty decision, devoid of rhetoric and with only glancing
acknowledgment of the real-world stakes involved. Instead, justices
on both sides engaged in microscopic analysis of the opaque and, on
their face, seemingly contradictory provisions of the Census Act
that governed the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   In concluding that federal law prohibits sampling, the court had
no need to rule on a constitutional issue that was also in the
case, the question of whether the Constitution's requirement of an
``actual enumeration'' makes the traditional head count mandatory.
The four justices who joined Justice O'Connor suggested, however,
that sampling would be unconstitutional even if federal law
permitted it; the four dissenters said it posed no constitutional
problem. Justice O'Connor herself expressed no view.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the case was the use of sampling for purposes of
apportioning seats in the House among the 50 states, the only
purpose the Constitution specifies for the census. Census figures
are used for many other purposes, however, most notably by the
states for redistricting and by the federal government for various
kinds of grants according to formulas based on population.
</P>
<P>
   The court's interpretation of the Census Act on Monday suggests
that figures adjusted by sampling should be used for these other
purposes, and administration officials said on Monday they intended
to do so. However, it is far from certain that the Republican-led
Congress would appropriate the money for the Census Bureau to
produce adjusted figures following the regular enumeration.
</P>
<P>
   Both administration officials and members of Congress indicated
on Monday that a major policy and budget battle could well break
out when the current appropriation for the census runs out on June
15. Last fall, the Republicans refused to give the Departments of
Justice, State, and Commerce _ the budget line that includes the
Census Bureau _ enough money to carry out their operations for the
full fiscal year, which runs until next Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook is complicated because the full enumeration required
by the ruling on Monday will in fact cost considerably more than
the sampling plan the administration wanted, so there is no doubt
that Congress will have to come up with more money. A further
complication is that the states have competing interests and do not
line up neatly along partisan lines.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Texas, a Republican-led state, strongly supports
sampling because it suffered disproportionately from the undercount
in the last census. The 1990 census missed some 483,000 Texans,
nearly 2.8 percent of the state's population, many of whom were
residents of the heavily Mexican colonias along the border, the
state told the Supreme Court in a brief it filed on the
administration's behalf.

CRITICS SEE FLAW IN CELLUCCI WELFARE REFORM PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Advocates for the jobless criticized Governor
Cellucci's new welfare overhaul ideas Monday saying that forcing
more recipients into the labor market and requiring them to work
longer hours will deprive them of the chance to learn new skills
that are crucial to obtaining better-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, in his state budget proposal to be released Wednesday,
called for tough measures that could push 11,000 more parents with
preschool-aged children off the welfare rolls sooner or altogether.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates contended that time spent working in menial jobs
is time spent away from retraining or education necessary to
improving one's earning's potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without providing them with an opportunity to learn more
skills, these working men and women are not likely to be able to
secure jobs with living wage and opportunity for career
advancement,'' said Massachusetts AFL-CIO president Robert Haynes.
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci, moments after announcing the broad plan at a State
House press conference Monday, said people who are not on welfare
juggle every day with work and continuing education. And he scoffed
at the idea that welfare recipients should be treated differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents are working their way off the rolls,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Cellucci said he is going to refile legislation to
increase the minimum wage, a factor that could entice more to get
off welfare, which provides, to an average family case, $3.26 per
hour based on 40-hour workweek.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci also outlined other funding to help ease recipients
into the labor market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're putting $56 million additional dollars into day care,''
Cellucci said, referring to his budget plan that will be filed
Wednesday. ``And we have a $10 million appropriation to help job
searches. ... President Clinton is proposing some money at the
federal level, which Massachusetts hopefully will get its fair
share to address transportation and other needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Under his proposal, thousands of new welfare applicants would be
required to enter a job search program within 60 days in order to
receive benefits. Able-bodied, single parents whose youngest child
is over 2, would have to work an additional 10 hours per week, or
30 hours in total. And two-parent families with children over 2
would have to work a total of at least 35 hours per week.
</P>
<P>
   Current law exempts recipients with children under age 6 from
working even though they are subject to the two-year benefits cap,
forcing them off welfare.
</P>
<P>
   In December, when thousands of parents were forced off welfare
under a two-year benefits cap, protests erupted at the State House.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, there were no demonstrations on Beacon Hill. And
there did not appear to be a huge outcry over the latest round of
proposed changes, among the first since welfare overhaul became law
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham said he was skeptical of
the measure and would be ``surprised if that quiescence
continued.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the more contentious issues I have faced in the
Legislature,'' the Chelsea Democrat said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of welfare reform has been to increase
self-sufficiency, which is in everyone's best interest,''
Birmingham added. ``But I've got a lot of questions, some of them
fiscal.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates argued Monday that by consuming recipients' time with
work, sometimes ``just for the sake of it,'' there was no time left
over for education or training, especially since many parents
already face a child-care crunch.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Fersh, director of Parents United for Child Care said she
doubts whether the $56 million child-care funding plan _ $33
million of which would pay for needs resulting from new regulations
_ would cover the demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department of Transitional Assistance must do a better job
of ensuring that parents receive the child-are benefits for which
they are eligible,'' Fersh said. ``The expansion of the child-care
subsidy system for both welfare recipients and low-income working
families must be done in a thoughtful way _ building the supply of
licensed, reliable, high quality care rather than relying on
unregulated informal child-care arrangements.''

COURT BARS ESTIMATING AS CENSUS TECHNIQUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court dealt a major blow to the Clinton
administration's plans for the 2000 Census by ruling the government
cannot use statistical sampling to estimate the number of Americans
the traditional head count may miss.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court's 5-4 majority and upholding the rulings
of two lower courts, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said the law
prohibits the Census Bureau from using population projections for
the purpose of apportioning the 435 congressional seats among the
states.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, one of the Supreme Court's most important this
term, disappointed some civil rights groups, who argue that
scientific estimation is the only way accurately to count urban
minorities and children the groups say were disproportionately
missed in the 1990 undercount of some 8.4 million people. It also
upset Democrats, who think they would gain seats through a sampling
adjustment of the census's traditional headcount.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, fearful an adjusted count of the population could
reapportion them out of congressional seats, have been fighting the
administration's Census 2000 plan. Monday GOP leaders hailed the
Supreme Court ruling and threatened a fight over funds for the
Census Bureau if President Clinton tried to find what
Representative Dan Miller, a Florida Republican who chairs the
census subcommittee, called ``a backdoor way to use his illegal
sampling plan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court today reaffirmed a basic constitutional
principle,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, who has been an
outspoken foe of sampling. ``The census must not be a poll, and
everyone must be counted. The administration must abandon its
illegal and risky polling scheme and start preparing a true
headcount.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spoksman Joe Lockhart, however, called Monday's
ruling a ``limited decision'' because the court banned sampling
only for reapportionment and suggested that it could be used _ in
fact, might be required _ to get accurate population figures for
both redrawing political districts within states and determining
how an estimated $180 billion in federal funds are distributed
every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this narrow decision gives supporters of an accurate
census a lot more than half a loaf,'' said Representative Carolyn
Maloney, the ranking Democrat on the census subcommittee. ``The
court found that federal statutes require the use of
direct-counting methods only for congressional apportionment.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of all the political and legal wrangling, the Census
Bureau has developed two game plans for the 2000 count: One would
rely on the traditional, head-count enumeration, and another would
count 90 percent of the population and do a scientific sample to
project the remaining 10 percent. Monday, Commerce Secretary
William M. Daley, whose department includes the Census Bureau, said
the agency would review the court decision and, if feasible,
produce two different population numbers _ one for apportionment,
based on a headcount, and a second for state redistricting and
funds distribution, based on a count plus sampling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously have to have one number that we know is going to
cause a tremendous undercount,'' Daley said, asserting ``the old
method'' will produce an inaccurate census. ``We are committed to
the most accurate census. So there must be two numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Prewitt, the Census Bureau director whose nomination was
held up in the Senate for seven months over his support for
sampling, issued a terse statement: ``Census Bureau career
professionals will conduct the census for 2000 that provides the
nation apportionment numbers that do not rely on statistical
sampling.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on Capitol Hill are bracing to fight for the Census
Bureau, which Republicans refused to fund beyond June. ``The new
arena in this battle is the House of Representatives, and there are
two certainties: The Republicans will try to block a fair count,
and Democrats will fight them,'' said Democratic leader Richard
Gephardt of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The court decided in favor of the Southeastern Legal Foundation,
an Atlanta-based legal advocacy group representing almost three
dozen states, counties, and individuals who claimed a census with
statistical sampling would hurt them. A second case, brought by
House Republicans, was dismissed because the court said Congress
did not have the legal standing to sue. Both cases won in lower
courts and were appealed by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Glavin, the Southeastern lawyer who argued the census
case at the Supreme Court, said it would be ``ridiculous,'' and
probably illegal, for the administration to try to produce two sets
of population numbers in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``To suggest that Georgia has a population of 7.8 million people
for apportionment but 8.2 million for redistricting is nonsense,''
Glavin said. ``I don't put anything past this president in trying
to ignore the law, but if he tries an end run around the
Constitution, he will find himself back in court.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's majority of Justices O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy,
William H. Rehnquist, Antonin Scalia, and Clarence Thomas accepted
the census undercount as a fact but determined that the 1954 Census
Act and later amendments expressly prohibited sampling for
apportionment. They did not address the Constitution, which calls
for an ``actual enumeration'' of the US population every 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting were Justices Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg,
Douglas H. Souter, and John Paul Stevens. Stevens wrote ``it tests
the limits of reason to suggest'' Congress would insist on a
door-to-door headcount, since the Census Bureau has used mail-in
questionnaires for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Clinton v. Glavin, 98-564.

KING HUSSEIN NAMES ELDEST SON AS SUCCESSOR
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ King Hussein of Jordan decreed on Monday that his
eldest son, Prince Abdullah, would be next in line for the throne,
Jordanian officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The king, 63, has already told his brother, Prince Hassan, that
his position as designated heir, as signified by the title crown
prince, is ending after 34 years.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah, who will soon turn 37, is a major general in the army
and leads Jordan's special forces. He is said to share his father's
common touch and is popular within the military, where support for
the monarchy is deeply rooted.
</P>
<P>
   Until less than a week ago, when the king returned from six
months of cancer treatment abroad, few in Jordan had doubted that
his brother would be next to assume the crown. The change in
successors could have more than a ceremonial effect on this tiny
country, which has been ruled by Hussein for 47 years. Jordan's
stability is of concern to its neighbors, from Israel to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Among its biggest challenges are the deepening unpopularity of
the peace with Israel, signed by the king in 1994 against the
wishes of most Jordanians, and widening concerns about the economy,
which has been in a state of crisis for most of the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Little is known about Abdullah, who has not been tested outside
the armed forces. Like his father, he attended the British military
academy at Sandhurst, England. A biographer, James Lunt, wrote in
his 1989 book ``Hussein of Jordan,'' published by Macmillan London,
that Abdullah was ``in many ways remarkably like his father in
character.''
</P>
<P>
   On infrequent occasions, Abdullah has served as regent in
Jordan, with the power to oversee the country during the absence of
senior members of the royal family. But some of his associates have
said he has never shown much ambition outside the army.
</P>
<P>
   The king, who broke the change of plan to his brother only last
Friday, signed the decree on Monday naming his son crown prince,
Jordanian officials said. The king was expected to make a
television speech to explain what led to his decision.
</P>
<P>
   There was no indication Monday that the change in succession
would prompt any internal challenge. But many Jordanians are
grumbling that the king has treated his brother badly.
</P>
<P>
   In reflecting on the move in telephone conversations Monday,
well-connected Jordanians, speaking on condition of anonymity,
hinted vaguely at the possibility of some kind of dissent by noting
that Abdullah's army background would almost certainly assure him
the ready support of the military. They did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Some people close to the king have spread word that the move
reflected dissatisfaction with Hassan's performance during the
king's absence. Among the allegations was that Hassan's
Pakistani-born wife, Princess Sarvath, had already started
refurbishing the king's office in anticipation of her husband's
ascent to the throne.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, including some close to Hassan, who is 51, have
pointed instead to the king's concern for posterity. They say they
believe that the king's two bouts with cancer have made him
conscious of his mortality and kindled a desire to insure that the
Hashemite line of succession _ which dates to 1201 _ passes to one
of his own sons.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The king is expected to name Hassan to a new post as his deputy,
with responsibilities that could include economic and Middle
Eastern affairs, Jordanian officials said. But Hassan, a loyal
stand-in, was said to have taken news of his demotion badly. Some
of his associates have said the prince might not accept the post.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein, who has ruled Jordan since 1952, has proved durable in
part because of his self-confidence and charisma, which have
endeared him to his people even as he has made decisions they
opposed. That has also endeared him to the West, particularly as it
has emboldened him to defy public opinion by reaching out to Israel
and assuming a role as a broker between the Israelis and
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan is a scholarly, Oxford-educated technocrat well versed in
economic and foreign affairs and more comfortable in a blazer than
Arab dress. He has always been seen in Jordan as more remote, which
raised doubts both at home and abroad about whether he could muster
the reservoir of support necessary to make courageous decisions.
</P>
<P>
   People who said that the king was dissatisfied with his
brother's performance suggested that the prince's record in running
the country over the last six months had shown that he was too
timid. They said the king thought his brother should have responded
more strongly both to Syrian accusations that Jordan was
collaborating with Israel against other Arabs, and to Iraqi
criticisms for not directly condemning American-led air strikes
last month.
</P>
<P>
   Many who believed there would be a new heir focused on Prince
Hamzeh, 18, the king's eldest son by his current wife, the
American-born Queen Noor.
</P>
<P>
   Hamzeh, who is now attending Sandhurst, was at his father's side
through most of his recent struggle with non-Hodgkins lymphoma, and
he is almost universally believed in Jordan to be the king's
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jordanian officials who would speak only on
condition of anonymity, the king gave Hamzeh serious consideration.
They said the king concluded that it would be unwise to hand such
responsibility to a teen-ager, especially so soon after the king
had completed cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some of them said they did not discount the possibility
that the king might one day make Hamzeh his heir.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Abdullah bin Hussein was born in Amman on Jan. 30, 1962,
to the king and his second wife, Toni Avril Gardiner, an
Englishwoman, who was known as Princess Musa.
</P>
<P>
   For a brief period after his birth, the infant was designated
crown prince, in keeping with the tradition of succession
incorporated into the Jordanian Constitution after the Emirate of
Transjordan was recognized as a state in 1923, under King Abdullah,
grandfather of the current king.
</P>
<P>
   It was not long, however, before Hussein decided that it would
be more prudent to name an older heir. After a series of
assassination attempts against him, and growing concern about the
stability of the kingdom, the king decided in 1965 that the crown
prince would be Hassan, then 18, even though that required amending
the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In the 34 years since, the king never declared outright that his
brother would be his permanent heir. Many have speculated over the
decades that he might one day replace his brother with a son, but
much of that talk gave way in recent years to the expectation that
Prince Hassan would take charge.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Prince Abdullah's mother was a foreigner, and
converted to Islam only upon marriage, has sometimes been seen as a
potential obstacle to his becoming king. A more sentimental choice
among many Jordanians has been Prince Ali, the king's eldest son by
his third wife, Queen Alia, a Palestinian, whom he married shortly
after divorcing Princess Musa in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Prince Abdullah _ who attended high school at the
Deerfield Academy in Illinois, took one-year courses at Oxford and
Georgetown Universities, and served for a short time in the British
army _ has in recent years soothed apprehensions that his outlook
might be directed abroad. His wife, Princess Rania, whom he married
in 1993, is a Palestinian. They have a son, Prince Hussein, and a
daughter, Princess Iman.

   MIAMI _ So many people to account for. Let's check Morten
Andersen's Super Bowl guest list: There's Uncle Knud-axel from
Denmark. The Bakers of Indianapolis, Lois and Dale, Andersen's host
family while a high-school foreign-exchange student. George and
Shirley, his old New Orleans neighbors. Andersen's wife, Jennifer,
and her family from Maine. His Danish parents, Hanne and Erik, and
brother Jakob. And Janice Appelgreen, the Big Rapids, Mich., woman
who was Andersen's surrogate mom when he kicked at Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying,'' Andersen said, ``to take care of those people
who took care of me when I was living on $150 bucks a month.''
</P>
<P>
   That's 15 people, and Andersen's taken care of everything.
Fifteen plane tickets to Miami. Nine hotel rooms. Super Bowl caps
and T-shirts for all, in everyone's size. And one last item. The
biggest big-ticket item in sports: 15 tickets to the Super Bowl.
Face value: $325 apiece. Street value? Don't ask. You can't afford
'em.
</P>
<P>
   ``A nightmare,'' said Rich Brooks, the Falcons defensive
coordinator. ``I've got 26 people here. Had to come up with 11 more
tickets. It's a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   A ticket nightmare for the most treasured ticket in sports.
Indeed, as both the Falcons and Broncos are finding this week,
maybe the only thing worse than not having any tickets to the Super
Bowl is having a limited number.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, 15. That's the number of tickets to which each
Falcons player and coach is entitled. Two are complimentary.
Freebies. Players and coaches may also buy up to 13 more tickets
(Cost: $4,225). That's 15 tickets total. And that, says Ray
Buchanan, is tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy,'' said Buchanan, the Falcons cornerback. ``You've
got family members calling you that you haven't heard from in 12
years, and they want to congratulate you.''
</P>
<P>
   And by the way, Ray, any extra tickets? ``We only get 15
tickets, and we can't please everybody,'' Buchanan said. ``It's
tough. I think we should have more tickets than anybody. We play in
the football game, and this is the chance of our life. Our (family
and friends) shouldn't have to watch it on TV. We've just gotta
bite the bullet.''
</P>
<P>
   That 15-caliber bullet is regulated by the NFL. A couple of
years ago, the league set the 15-ticket limit for players and
coaches from the Super Bowl participants. For years, that was up to
the discretion of each team. Both teams are always given the same
number of tickets, based on a percentage of the stadium's capacity.
Some teams made more tickets available to players than the other.
Those short-changed players were livid, until the league stepped in
and set a limit.
</P>
<P>
   As for the breakdown of the Falcons' tickets, team president
Taylor Smith has been very generous to the long-time supporters of
a team that's finally in its first Super Bowl after 33 often-dismal
seasons. Although Smith and general manager Harold Richardson
wouldn't comment specifically, half of the Falcons tickets went to
season-ticket holders and suite holders. That's very generous by
league practices and Smith's way of rewarding those who backed the
team in its darkest days.
</P>
<P>
   Those tickets were distributed through a weighted lottery, based
on how many season tickets people had and for how long. Those
picked got to buy two Super Bowl tickets. ``So you hit the largest
number of season ticket holders,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides players and coaches, tickets were also available to
employees, corporate sponsors, through contractual marketing
agreements and also some ex-Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   At the Falcons' first meeting after having won the NFC
championship, Cornelius Bennett was ``stunned,'' according to
someone at the meeting, that players could only get 15 tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very tight,'' the linebacker said of the ticket
situation. ``They cut our number in half.''
</P>
<P>
   For each of the four consecutive Super Bowls that Bennett played
in with Buffalo, the available tickets varied. ``My last year
(Super Bowl XXVIII in Atlanta, in January, 1994), it was 30 _ two
(comps) and 28 (purchased),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This time, tickets are tougher. For everyone, including the
scalpers.
</P>
<P>
   Scalpers? Surely, there's no Super Bowl scalping. Like every
Super Bowl team, the Falcons advised their players about ticket
ethics. ``Sure,'' Richardson said. ``And they're not given to you
to go out and make a profit. Can you control what they do with them
once they have them? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Super Bowl XXVII, Dallas' first in 14 years, the Cowboys
got their tickets in the off week at their training complex. Valley
Ranch was overrun that day with ticket agents armed with cell
phones, Rose Bowl seating charts and cash, buying tickets from
players in the parking lot. Wide receiver Kelvin Martin walked
through the locker room with an envelope stuffed with $100 bills.
When it was reported the next day, coach Jimmy Johnson had
uniformed security cops in the lots. A few agents still got in the
locker room.
</P>
<P>
   There are no such scandals this time. The demand, of course, is
still outrageous. Keith Brooking, the Falcons' rookie linebacker
and first-round draft pick from Georgia Tech, could have used 200
tickets for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   And Andersen? ``It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and I want
them to have a nice time,'' Andersen said. ``I just decided to do
it because it's going to be a dream of their's, too. You hope
you'll get back to the game, but you never know.''

CLINTON WILL NOT ANSWER WRITTEN QUESTIONS, WHITE HOUSE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss.)  (See related stories: IMPEACH-RDP, IMPEACH-PUBLIC, IMPEACH-CONVICT,
IMPEACH-SESSIONS, IMPEACH-LEWINSKY, IMPEACH-TRIAL, IMPEACH-SCENE) 
(mk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Republicans, seeking to resolve apparent
conflicts in testimony by President Clinton and other witnesses,
submitted 10 written questions to Clinton Monday. The White House
promptly said he would refuse to answer them.
</P>
<P>
   The questions, some of them phrased in confrontational language,
explore familiar gaps between the president's account of his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky and the testimony of others.
Several of the inquiries require the kind of direct, categorical
answers that Clinton has so far been reluctant to provide.
</P>
<P>
   The questions were submitted in a letter to Charles Ruff, the
White House counsel, by Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority
leader, and nine other Republican senators. They asked Clinton for
``a personal response, in writing and under oath.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott said some of the questions cover ground that the
president's lawyers addressed in his defense. But the abundant
testimony in the case has left some questions that only Clinton can
answer, Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``While counsel for the president has ably attempted to answer
these and similar questions from the Senate, only Clinton can
provide complete answers to these questions because many of them
concern his state of mind or facts that only he is privy to,'' the
senators wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, reacted angrily
to Lott's questions, calling them a political ploy that violated
the bipartisan deal on trial procedures that the Senate made three
weeks ago. He said the president would not respond to the
questions, nor would his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These questions have been offered outside the Senate
procedures that were agreed to on a bipartisan basis by all 100
senators,'' Lockhart said. ``We have made clear we will abide by
the rules and procedures the Senate laid out. I'd suggest this has
more to do with playing politics than with trying to bring this to
a fair and expeditious conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate questions deal with many of the same factual issues
as the 81 questions submitted to Clinton by the House Judiciary
Committee last fall. Clinton's answers to those questions so
infuriated Republicans on the committee that they approved an
article of impeachment based on them. But that article was one of
two that the full House failed to pass on Dec. 19.
</P>
<P>
   The first question from the Senate Republicans asks Clinton to
state whether all of his testimony in the deposition he made on
Jan. 17, 1998, in the Paula Jones case was true. The senators
demand a yes or no answer.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, directly and through his lawyers, has said that he did
not commit perjury in the Jones deposition, but has never said that
all of his testimony was truthful. Ruff has said that ``reasonable
people'' could conclude that the president lied in the deposition,
while insisting that he did not perjure himself.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the other inquiries highlight perceived conflicts
between Clinton's testimony and the testimony of others, including
his secretary, Betty Currie, and two of his aides, John Podesta and
Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   The senators ask whether the president believes that Ms.
Lewinsky was lying when she said that he had touched her in ways
that met the definition of ``sexual relations'' used in the Jones
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors from the House and several Republican senators have
said the only way to resolve these inconsistencies is to call
witnesses before the Senate for questioning, but a Senate
Republican aide said the questions were not specifically designed
to form a basis for calling witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't driven as a political tool simply designed to show
the need for witnesses,'' the aide said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``But if that is the effect and the president is
refusing to answer, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   The senators also ask Clinton to explain why Dick Morris, a
former White House political adviser, conducted a poll on Jan. 21,
1998, on whether the American people would forgive him for
committing the crimes of perjury and obstruction of justice. When
asked by the senators recently why the poll was conducted, Ruff
answered, ``I don't have a clue.''
</P>
<P>
   The senators ask Clinton to explain why Morris conducted the
poll and who paid for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are good questions,'' Morris said in a telephone
interview Monday night, without offering any further information of
the sort the senators sought.

 &HT;    Witness decision pivotal in impeachment trial
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett and Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate considers today the most divisive issue
in President Clinton's impeachment trial _ whether to call
witnesses _ as a search for a quick end to the proceedings grew
frantic Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Senators also appeared to be on the verge of rejecting the
quickest exit, dismissing the perjury and obstruction of justice
charges against Clinton. Adhering to rules adopted in 1868,
senators met into the night in secret session to discuss a
Democratic proposal to dismiss the charges.
</P>
<P>
   When the trial resumes at noon, House prosecutors will reveal
the names of the witnesses they would like to call and spend up to
three hours arguing why they need witnesses to complete their case
against the president. White House lawyers also will have three
hours in opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Votes on whether to dismiss the case and issue subpoenas to
witnesses could come late in the day, but more likely will occur
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are drafting a list of ``three to six'' potential
witnesses, Rep. Steve Chabot (R-Ohio), one of the prosecutors,
said. The names most frequently discussed by the prosecutors, their
aides and senators are: Monica Lewinsky, presidential confidant
Vernon Jordan, Oval Office secretary Betty Currie and White House
aides John Podesta and Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   Some prosecutors had also favored adding former presidential
pollster Dick Morris and the women who had alleged in the Paula
Jones litigation that the president made unwanted sexual advances
toward them. Several senators have said, however, that the House
would lose support for witnesses if the list is long and extends
beyond the charges contained in the articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, meanwhile, made it clear that senators will not
likely hear anything more from Clinton. The White House said
neither Clinton nor his lawyers would answer 10 questions from
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) about inconsistent
statements the president made in independent counsel Kenneth
Starr's nine-month investigation of his affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said questions to the
president are ``not called for in the Senate procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate lurched forward with Clinton's trial in fits and
starts Monday, as private negotiations off the Senate floor to
arrange an end to the three-week trial overshadowed the official
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Trial balloons rose and fell in quick succession when senators
returned to the Capitol early Monday amid expressions of weariness
and in an atmosphere of near total confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Lott delayed the start of the trial by one hour to give
Democrats and Republicans more time to work out a game plan for how
to proceed with the three-week old impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   A bid to bypass votes on dismissal and witnesses and move
instead to a vote on the impeachment articles by Friday collapsed
in the face of strong opposition from GOP senators who are still
insisting on the need for witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trial would not be complete without some kind of
witnesses,'' said Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.).
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Republicans are unsure if they can muster the
support of 51 of the 55 GOP senators to allow the prosecutors to
conduct interviews with the witnesses under oath. Democrats appear
united in opposition to introducing witnesses into the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of my colleagues who are not likely to go
for witnesses,'' said Sen. Gordon Smith (R-Ore.).
</P>
<P>
   The key sticking point on the witness issue for many Republicans
appears to be how many witnesses would be called and what they
would be asked to testify about.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer witnesses testifying to a limited number of facts would be
more likely to be endorsed by a majority of Republicans, several
senators said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure that it's very limited and it's getting
to the truth,'' Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) said.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual exchange between Grassley and Sen. Max Baucus
(D-Mont.) in front of a handful of reporters, Baucus told Grassley
that Democrats might tolerate a limited number of witnesses being
deposed but were firmly against any being called to testify in the
Senate chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will take too much time,'' Baucus said.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea gaining some currency among Republican senators is
a still informal plan to vote on a so-called finding of fact before
a vote on the articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The finding of fact would say that Clinton lied under oath and
obstructed justice, John Czwartacki, Lott's spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   This would have the effect of saying Clinton was guilty of the
charges, but that the Senate declined to remove him.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jim Kennedy declined to comment on the
idea. ``We have said that it has to be bipartisan, prompt and
fair,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan effort by Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) and Sen. Edward
Kennedy (D-Mass.), also underway Monday, would allow for a limited
number of witnesses to be questioned in private.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's leaving the station just yet,'' Czwartacki said.
</P>
<P>
   Late into the evening Monday, senators wrestled with the first
key vote in the impeachment trial _ whether to dismiss the two
articles of impeachment against Clinton, thereby ending the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Before the deliberations, the Senate defeated a motion by Sen.
Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) to open the deliberations to the public by a
vote of 57 to 43. Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.) voted against open
proceedings, while Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.) supported the motion,
which required a two-thirds vote.
</P>
<P>
   Well before prosecutors and defense attorneys argued their case
for and against dismissal, leaders from both parties were insisting
that most minds were already made up. Republicans are lined up
largely against the dismissal, while Democrats appear likely to
vote overwhelmingly for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the votes, I believe, not to dismiss at this point,''
Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate floor, White House lawyer Nicole Seligman argued
that the charges against Clinton did not rise to the level of a
constitutional crime punishable by removal, that they were overly
vague and that the evidence was too circumstantial and too
ambiguous to warrant conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doubt here is pervasive,'' Seligman argued. ``Where there
is room for reasonable disagreement, there is no room for
conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors argued equally passionately that the Senate
would have to ignore precedent and the facts to dismiss the case.
</P>
<P>
   The search for truth ``should not be trumped by a search for an
exit strategy,'' Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.), the lead prosecutor,
said. ``Let us finish our job.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of the Senate's quest for a bipartisan deal also rankled
other House prosecutors, especially Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be pressure from both sides to search for an
exit strategy, rather than a constitutional strategy,'' said Barr.
``That demeans the Senate. It means they don't care about the
Constitution. It means all they care about is a quick way out.''

AFTER 23 YEARS, JUSTICES WILL REVISIT CAMPAIGN LIMITS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a case that brings the debate over money and
politics back to the Supreme Court's door, the justices on Monday
agreed to decide whether the strict contribution limits that the
court upheld for federal elections 23 years ago are still
constitutionally valid.
</P>
<P>
   The issue reached the court not in the context of the federal
law the justices addressed then, in the Buckley vs. Valeo decision,
but as a challenge to a 1994 Missouri election law that
incorporated the same limits of $1,000 per election.
</P>
<P>
   In a Nov. 30 ruling, a federal appeals court panel in St. Louis
struck down the Missouri law on the ground that the limits were
``so small that they run afoul of the Constitution by unnecessarily
restricting protected First Amendment freedoms.'' Limits that made
sense in 1976, when they were upheld by the Supreme Court in the
Buckley case, have been so eroded by inflation as to stand in the
way of ``meaningful participation in protected political speech and
association,'' the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said.
</P>
<P>
   In one analysis in the case, the current value of $1,000 in 1976
dollars is $2,500. The Missouri limit has been adjusted for
inflation under a state legislative formula, and was $1,075 when
the appeals court struck it down; there are now no contribution
limits in effect in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri told the Supreme Court that the appeals court had
placed many similar state campaign laws in an intolerable
constitutional limbo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be difficult to find an issue of greater national
significance that both requires and warrants some measure of legal
certainty,'' Jeremiah W. Nixon, Missouri's attorney general, told
the court. The constitutionality of the federal limits is also at
stake, Nixon said.
</P>
<P>
   While it is by no means certain, or perhaps not even likely,
that the justices will use this case as a vehicle for a broad
revisiting of the Buckley decision, the prospect is there.
Inexplicably, the court indicated on Monday that it would not hear
the case until next fall, meaning that a decision might not come
until a year or more from now. The state had filed its appeal with
unusual speed, in less than two weeks rather than the allowable 90
days, in the hope that the justices would be able to hear the case
in April and decide it by the end of the current term in June.
April is the last month during which the justices hear arguments,
and they have scheduled only 12 arguments for a calendar that can
accommodate 24.
</P>
<P>
   While accepting the state's appeal, Nixon vs. Shrink Missouri
government PAC, No. 98-963, the court took no action on a companion
appeal that raised more directly the continued viability of Buckley
vs. Valeo.
</P>
<P>
   This second case, filed by a member of the Missouri House of
Representatives, asked the court to decide ``whether the analytic
structure undergirding Buckley vs. Valeo has become so confused and
unwieldy as to call for reconsideration of the relationship between
the First Amendment and content-neutral efforts to regulate the
financing of political campaigns.'' (Bray vs. Shrink Missouri
government PAC, No. 98-978)
</P>
<P>
   The Buckley decision has come under intense criticism recently,
not for its upholding of the federal contribution limits, but for
the other half of the decision, which equated campaign spending
with political speech and struck down expenditure limits. Despite
the criticism that the decision has made it impossible to regulate
the flow of money into politics, the court has not displayed much
appetite for revisiting it.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the action on Monday may reflect primarily the court's
sense of obligation to clarify the contribution issue. In a 1997
case from Kentucky, another federal appeals court _ the 6th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals _ upheld a $1,000 contribution limit
against a similar challenge, and it is now clear that the judicial
unanimity that has prevailed for more than two decades is beginning
to fray.
</P>
<P>
   The 8th Circuit in the Missouri case subjected the state law to
an analysis that differed considerably from the approach the
Supreme Court took in the Buckley decision. The appeals court said
a high level of proof was necessary _ ``demonstrable evidence'' of
``genuine problems'' from large political contributions _ to
justify the limits. The Supreme Court in the Buckley decision
accepted anecdotal evidence and said that the government only had
to prove that the problems were ``not illusory.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There were also these other actions on an extremely busy day at
the court: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESSIONAL POWER
</P>
<P>
   Taking up an important question of federal-state authority, the
court agreed to decide whether Congress had the authority to make
states liable to suit in federal court for violating the federal
law that bars age discrimination on the job. In a decision last
year, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Atlanta, refused
to allow an age discrimination suit against Florida by current and
former faculty members of two state universities. The justices
accepted appeals from both the plaintiffs (Kimel vs. Florida, No.
98-791) and from the federal government, which supported them (U.S.
vs. Florida, No. 98-796).  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   POLICE RECORDS
</P>
<P>
   Accepting an appeal from the Los Angeles Police Department, the
court agreed to decide the constitutionality of a California law
under which various police records can be released to the public
but may not be used for commercial purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The law was challenged by a publishing service that provides
names of people who have been arrested or who are victims of crime
and sells the information to lawyers, insurance companies, driving
schools and others. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in San
Francisco, ruled last year that the law violated the company's
First Amendment right to commercial speech. The case is Los Angeles
Police Department vs. United Reporting Publishing Corp., No.
98-678.

   ST. LOUIS _ With banners declaring ``John Paul II, We Love You''
draping buildings downtown, the people of this historically Roman
Catholic city made last-minute preparations Monday to welcome the
pope.
</P>
<P>
   The pontiff is due to arrive in St. Louis at 1 p.m. CST Tuesday
after a five-day visit to Mexico City. Among the people welcoming
him will be President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Their encounter will bring together a pontiff who decries
materialism and capitalistic excess with a president quick to cite
a healthy economy as one of his administration's most important
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent Gallup Poll, the pair topped the list of
the men most admired by Americans last year, with Clinton placing
first and Pope John Paul II coming in second.
</P>
<P>
   Their meeting will take place at a critical point in Clinton's
trial before the Senate over the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Airport officials predicted tight security surrounding both men
could delay regular flights in and out of St. Louis by 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, whose worldwide flock numbers 1 billion, is to spend
just 30 hours in St. Louis. He is coming at the invitation of
Archbishop Justin Rigali, who served as a Vatican official for 30
years before being named head of the Archdiocese of St. Louis in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's visit to the Midwestern city will include a youth
rally, a Mass at Trans World Dome and an evening prayer service at
St. Louis Catholic Cathedral Basilica. About 90 non-Catholic guests
are expected to attend the prayer service, making it perhaps the
most diverse religious gathering ever at the cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   Among the church officials greeting John Paul at the airport
will be Bishop Joseph Fiorenza, spiritual leader to 1 million in
the Diocese of Galveston-Houston and president of the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops. Nine U.S. cardinals also will greet
the pope.
</P>
<P>
   Fiorenza said that never in his ``wildest dreams'' had he
expected to welcome the pope on behalf of his fellow bishops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not apprehensive,'' he said Monday before flying to St.
Louis. ``I feel honored.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that John Paul will re-emphasize themes he
expounded during his visit to Mexico City and call on the church in
North and South America to ``be in solidarity'' in opposing
``unbridled profit motives'' in global economics that hurt the
poor.
</P>
<P>
   The bishop said the pope will likely remind the United States
that its status as a superpower carries with it a responsibility to
``be a moral leader, not just an economic leader.''
</P>
<P>
   In St. Louis, the excitement over the city's first papal visit
may surpass even the hoopla that surrounded the Cardinals when Mark
McGwire batted his way to a record 70 home runs last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Official welcoming banners that carry the pope's image are
draped from nearly every light standard along the papal parade
route, and messages welcoming the pontiff speak out from marquees
in front of non-Catholic churches and even burger joints.
Convenience stores and delis are selling commemorative postcards.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks leading up to the visit, 95 percent of downtown
streets have been repaved. Enormous lights have been set up so that
the city's 630-foot tall Gateway Arch, which stands beside the
Mississippi River, shimmers.
</P>
<P>
   Nuns at several convents have prayed that the city be blessed
with fair skies and mild temperatures during the pope's visit.
Other nuns have baked 131,000 communion hosts for the papal Mass on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As ice floated down the Mississippi River on Monday, city crews
scrambled to finish erecting the 15 miles of orange portable
fencing that will hold back the crowds along the papal parade
route.
</P>
<P>
   Few residents will be able to escape some level of inconvenience
over the next few days as the pope's motorcade causes traffic
detours and delays. At St. Louis University, where the motorcade
will run through the heart of campus, administrators have decided
to give up and dismiss classes at midday Tuesday. Classes will not
resume until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the city's Catholics think it's all just a bit much.
Frank Fick, a St. Louis engineer, plans to attend the papal Mass.
But he shakes his head at the hoopla surrounding the visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become a pageant,'' he said. ``I presume it's supposed to
be a religious event. Oh, well, he is a head of state, too.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A wealth of Catholic history surrounds St. Louis. A number of
the region's early explorers were French priests. The city was
founded by Pierre Laclede, a Catholic fur trader who set up a
trading post in 1764. He christened the city St. Louis in honor of
a French monarch.
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of the area's citizenry is Catholic. There are a
number of Catholic schools, and a majority of the region's
hospitals are run by Catholic orders of nuns. Many city streets are
named for Catholics, and the largest nonprofit charity in Missouri
and Illinois is Catholic Charities, the church's outreach arm in
the region.
</P>
<P>
   The pontiff awaited by all these Catholics is frail and
slow-moving at age 78. John Paul's opposition to birth control and
the ordination of women and married men as priests puts him at odds
with the more liberal members of his 61.5 million-member U.S.
flock. But he still draws huge crowds.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 1 million people attended his Sunday Mass in Mexico
City. St. Louis is bracing for as many as 600,000 _ including
busloads of pilgrims from Texas and neighboring states _ to gather
to see the pope.

CHECKING THE CRYSTAL BALL ON THE CELTICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They have been training for less than a week, but we
still know plenty about the Celtics. We know Rick Pitino has
promised not to trade Paul Pierce. We know no player on the roster
can be a credible spokesman for Jenny Craig. We know how to keep up
with the Joneses, too, realizing the difference between the Jones
who was paid to stay (Popeye) and the Jones who was paid to go away
(Dontae).
</P>
<P>
   One thing, though, no one knows. Pitino doesn't know it and
neither does your neighbor: How will the Celtics look when the
scores begin to count?
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with access to a television has been able to see that the
Celtics look as svelte now as they did on April 18, 1998, the last
time they played a game. But that date is also part of the problem.
The 18th of April was nine months ago. If you ask any team to take
nine months off between games, what you're really asking for is
confusion.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics believe that's a good thing. They will be in Toronto
Tuesday night, getting their first chance to see what they missed
in center Michael Stewart. They also will be at SkyDome, playing
their first exhibition game against the Raptors. The last time the
Celtics took a court collectively, Pierce was still trying to
choose between the University of Kansas and the pros, assistant
coach Lester Conner was ``Celtics coaching candidate'' Lester
Conner, and Tyus Edney was in his final hours as the Celtics' best
point guard.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the game may be sloppy. But at least it's a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``In practice, we do all right because we're playing against
each other and know what plays we're trying to run,'' Ron Mercer
said. ``But now we get to play against different guys who will be
doing things that we don't practice. It will be good. It will have
the atmosphere, the fans, the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be several subplots in Toronto. Not only will Kenny
Anderson be testing his sore knees for the first time (in a
semi-official game), he will be facing the team that once traded
for him. Before Anderson arrived in Boston, the Trail Blazers sent
him to Toronto for Damon Stoudamire. Anderson refused to report,
forcing the deal to the Celtics. He, Popeye Jones, and Zan Tabak
landed in Boston while Chauncey Billups, Dee Brown, John Thomas,
and Roy Rogers became Raptors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never a Raptor,'' Anderson said Monday during the team's
annual Media Day. ``I have nothing against that city, but I just
didn't want to play for an expansion team.''
</P>
<P>
   If Anderson plays several minutes and happens to drive toward
the basket, there is a good chance he will be running into the
6-foot-10-inch Stewart. Last week, the former free agent center
decided to sign a one-year contract with the Raptors rather than a
multiyear deal with the Celtics. One of Stewart's teammates knows
about multiyear deals with the Celtics. Brown was halfway through
his six-year contract when the Celtics traded him nearly a year
ago. This will be his first game against the team that drafted him.
And it will be the first NBA game, of any kind, for rookie forward
Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino said he doesn't expect the Celtics to be fluid
offensively. He also knows they won't be healthy. Bruce Bowen and
Greg Minor could miss the season opener because of respective wrist
and ankle injuries (Minor may need surgery). Tony Battie and Dwayne
Schintzius are expected to play, even though both experienced back
spasms over the weekend. And Walter McCarty has a turf-toe type
injury but is expected to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some guys banged up, but I'm going up there looking
for a win,'' Antoine Walker said. ``I don't believe in taking the
court just for the sake of taking the court. I'm looking for us to
do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Celtics have added Battie and Jones, there may be
moments when Walker plays small forward with either Battie or Jones
playing power forward. That is one of the Celtics' luxuries this
year. It was nearly impossible last season because Walker was their
only proven, double-digit rebounder. Now he has Jones, who can say
that he once led the entire league in offensive rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to be hyped for this game,'' said Dana
Barros. ``I think you're going to see a lot of energy and running.
We're definitely going to be running.''
</P>
<P>
   But what about artistic merit? How will the Celtics play?
</P>
<P>
   Barros thought about that question for a while. And then he
smiled.

   COALITION-RACISM (Undated) _ Gordon Lee Baum's Council of
Conservative Citizens emerged recently as an ideological skeleton
lurking in the closets of two Republicans who figure prominently in
the effort to remove President Clinton from office. That increasing
scrutiny of the St. Louis group, Baum insists, reeks of guilt by
association that overstates the council's racial ideas in order to
tar politicians involved in the impeachment effort. ``We're not
white supremacists,'' he says. ``We are pro-European Americans. We
are pro-white.'' By SCOTT CANON. Story will move in the ``w''

 &HT;    Senators caught between White House rock, managers' hard place
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The horns of the impeachment dilemma have been
obvious for some time: a process that can't be stopped, straining
toward the ouster of a popular president who will not be moved. To
maintain proper order, however, various means have been used to
cloak this inescapable contradiction.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday afternoon, when it came time for the Senate to grab
the horns and begin making tough decisions about the resolution of
this trial, it did the sensible thing and voted to keep its
deliberations private.
</P>
<P>
   The horns had become fully visible by then, nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   What hopes the Republican House managers may have had to bring
their case against Bill Clinton to a successful conclusion should
have been dashed by the reaction to their latest gambit, the
weekend meeting at the Mayflower Hotel with Monica Lewinsky. That
session produced one of the most bizarre press conferences to date
Sunday night, when three House managers emerged to praise the
former White House intern for her ``intelligence and poise,'' as
Rep. Asa Hutchinson (R-Ark.) put it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this praise, lavished on a young woman whose life
they've not made easier, was a tacit admission that the interview
didn't turn up much new information. Maybe it was also an attempt
to reassure their Republican colleagues in the Senate that calling
her as a witness would not jeopardize the decorum of the upper
chamber. If that's what it was, it didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   The alarmed comments of several Republican senators on the
Sunday talk shows made it clear the incident only heightened their
fears that this process could get out of hand if it goes on much
longer. With Republicans like Richard Shelby of Alabama and Olympia
Snowe of Maine openly questioning the need to call witnesses, the
handwriting would seem to be on the wall. But bringing the process
to a halt still requires an act of political will that is not yet
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina was using the question as
a means of summing things up Monday when he asked: ``What did Bill
Clinton do, and why are we all here?''
</P>
<P>
   But the bemused looks on some of the senators' faces gave the
question a deeper meaning. Most seem to have formulated an answer
to the first part of that question, yet not many seemed very
confident they knew the answer to the second part.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case cannot be made. It is time to end it,'' Clinton's
attorney, Nicole Seligman, argued Monday. But how? That question
has both Democrats and Republicans stumped.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Byrd's motion to dismiss the case the development
that may have prompted the managers to call their meeting with
Lewinsky _ seemed doomed before the Senate went into private
session to debate it.
</P>
<P>
   ''What this is, this motion, is a legal way of saying, So
what?'' declared House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde. Clearly,
however, a number of Republican senators have begun the search for
an instrument that would have approximately the same effect.
</P>
<P>
   One of the buzzwords of the first week of the trial was
``percolate,'' a verb used to describe various ideas working their
way to the surface. One of last week's buzzwords, highlighted by
former Sen. Dale Bumpers, was ``proportionality.''
</P>
<P>
   This week the two buzzwords have been combined in a sentence. To
achieve ``proportionality,'' said John Czwartacki, an aide to
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, a suggestion was ``percolating''
that the Senate might vote a ``finding of fact,'' that Clinton
obstructed justice and committed perjury, before voting on the
actual question of removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it goes anywhere or not, this percolating idea bespeaks
the senators' earnest desire to get themselves out from between the
increasingly embittered House managers and the consistently
intractable White House, which Monday backed away from cooperating
with Lott's request that Clinton answer more questions.
</P>
<P>
   The buzzword everyone wants to hear, but none dares speak just
yet, is ``endgame.''

HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS ROSE SHARPLY IN 1998 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Health care inflation is back.
</P>
<P>
   After years of holding the line on health care costs, insurance
companies began to significantly raise premiums in 1998, according
to a survey being released Tuesday by William M. Mercer, a benefits
consulting firm in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Total premiums paid by employers and workers surged 6.1 percent
in 1998, up sharply from a 0.2 percent increase in 1997, according
to the Mercer's nationwide survey of 4,181 employers with 17.2
million workers in America.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in Massachusetts, however, was a modest 1.5 percent
as insurers in the Bay State were slower to boost rates.
Nationally, it was the first major hike reported in the annual
survey since 1993, when premiums rose 8 percent. Behind last year's
increases were soaring prescription drug costs, growing overall
medical costs and low profits in the health insurance industry,
according to Susan Connolly, a principal at Mercer and head of the
company's health care consulting group in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Drug prices were a major driver of costs, rising 13.8 percent
last year, according to the survey, which was known as the Foster
Higgins survey until 1997, when Mercer purchased Foster Higgins, a
consulting firm that put out the annual report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pharmaceutical companies have been able to extract enormous
profits in recent years,'' said Uwe E. Reinhardt, professor of
health economics at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of
Public and International Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, years of luring new members with low premiums have
eroded insurance companies' profit margins. As a result, many
insurers are jacking up premiums to shore up their finances.
</P>
<P>
   ``From 1994 to 1997, lots of insurance companies were pricing
below their costs in order to build market share,'' said Reinhardt.
``In the process, they pulverized their reserves and their net
worth. Eventually they have to rebuild those reserves, and they do
that by raising premiums.''
</P>
<P>
   As steep as 1998 rates were, many health care analysts are
expecting even bigger increases this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to see a real spike in premiums this year,''
Connolly said. One reason: A national wave of mergers among health
insurance companies has also reduced the field of competitors,
enabling insurers to raise premiums with less fear of losing
business to a rival, said Connolly.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, premiums rose just 1.5 percent in 1998, but
the low rates reflect a one-year delay in higher premiums rather
than a long-term reprieve from health care inflation, Connolly
said. Indeed, employers in the state have reported premium
increases from 5 percent to 15 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're in for a rude awakening this year,'' Connolly said of
Massachusetts companies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the recent increases are a far cry from the double-digit
inflation seen in the late 1980s, when premiums shot up as high as
18.6 percent in a single year. The ascendancy of managed care
insurers that attempt to control cost by eliminating unnecessary
care has helped to rein in rampant health care spending. But those
cost controls may be eroding as Americans bridle at restrictions to
health care access.
</P>
<P>
   Enrollment in health maintenance organizations, the most
restrictive form of health insurance, fell for the first time in
the 13-year history of the survey, from 30 percent of insured
workers to 20 percent. Enrollment in so-called point-of-service
plans that require members to obtain referrals to see specialists
also declined to 18 percent from 20 percent. Meanwhile, preferred
provider plans which allow patients to see specialists without
referrals, gained popularity, rising from 35 percent of insured
workers in 1997 to 40 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are voting with their feet,'' said Connolly. ``They
want choice. In their minds, quality is being associated with
broader access to health care.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, enrollment in traditional indemnity plans is at a
record low, making up just 13 percent of insured employees last
year, down from 15 percent in 1997. For many employees, indemnity
coverage, which gives patients virtually unrestricted access to the
widest choice of providers, ceased to be an option as companies,
balking at the high premiums, abandoned indemnity coverage in favor
of lower-cost managed care options. Indemnity plans, however, will
not disappear, Connolly predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will always be a future for indemnity insurance,'' she
said. ``People who have indemnity insurance are those in rural
areas where HMOs have yet to develop. It will also survive as a
high-cost plan for the rich and famous who can't be bothered by the
nuisances of managed care.''

DESPITE DENIALS, CHARGES OF RACISM FOLLOW GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gordon Lee Baum opens conversations these days with a protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not monsters,'' he says, his speech quickening in
agitation. ``They're trying to make us out as ogres.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, his Council of Conservative Citizens emerged recently as
an ideological skeleton lurking in the closets of two Republicans
who figure prominently in the effort to remove President Clinton
from office.
</P>
<P>
   That increasing scrutiny of the St. Louis group, Baum insists,
reeks of guilt by association that overstates the council's racial
ideas in order to tar politicians involved in the impeachment
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not white supremacists,'' he says. ``We are pro-European
Americans. We are pro-white.''
</P>
<P>
   Read racist, say critics, including the Republican National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Columnists in the CCC's newspaper, the /{Citizens Informer/},
have described interracial marriage as ``an effort to destroy
Western civilization.'' Writers on the group's Web site ridicule
Martin Luther King Jr. as a ``liar'' and ``sex addict,'' proclaim
Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee as history's greatest American and
worry that nonwhite immigrants will make the country ``a slimy
brown mass of glop.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, especially in the South, the group mingles regularly with
political powerbrokers. U.S. Rep. Bob Barr, one of the House
managers of Clinton's Senate trial, has spoken at a national
meeting of the group. U.S. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of
Mississippi spoke at CCC meetings on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
   The CCC led the successful effort to keep the Confederate flag
waving over the South Carolina state capitol. Its annual rallies in
Black Hawk, Miss., have drawn Lott, plus the state's Republican
governor and Democratic attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a several-year track record of successfully marrying
the white supremacist fringe types with local and state Republican
politicians and thereby having an influence in the mainstream
discourse,'' said Leonard Zeskind, a Kansas City author who has
received a grant from the MacArthur Foundation for his research on
right-wing groups.
</P>
<P>
   After recent articles appeared in /{The Washington Post/} and
/{The New York Times/} noting their presence at CCC gatherings,
Lott and Barr said they did not know what the group's views were. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Recently Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson
urged party leaders to resign from the CCC. Buddy Witherspoon, a
national party member from South Carolina, has resisted that call.
</P>
<P>
   But at RNC headquarters, there's no fudging in the denunciation
of the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that the group does have racist views,'' said RNC
spokesman Mark Pfeifle. ``The Republican Party rejects and condemns
such views very forcefully and without hesitation.''
</P>
<P>
   At the CCC's headquarters in St. Louis, Baum greets the
repudiation with a disappointed chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've baited the RNC into something stupid here,'' said
Baum, the group's chief executive officer. ``It's like they've
decided to chase off the Wallace-slash-Reagan Democrats.... It's
like they're saying, `Let's get rid of the angry white guys.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The CCC is a philosophical successor to the ``citizens
councils,'' made up primarily of white businessmen, that sprouted
across the South in the 1950s and 1960s in opposition to the civil
rights movements.
</P>
<P>
   Baum and about 30 others formed the group in Atlanta in 1985.
That core group, Baum said, included people who belonged to the old
citizens councils. But this new organization was designed to focus
on a broader range of conservative causes that included support of
tighter immigration, stronger states' rights and opposition to gun
control, forced busing and affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   The national CCC set up shop in St. Louis because that's where
Baum has a law practice. The CCC has active chapters in 28 states _
throughout all of the former Confederacy and border states _
including two chapters in eastern Missouri. There is no chapter in
Kansas City, although Baum said he has members here.
</P>
<P>
   More than 15,000 people pay annual dues of $25 or more to the
CCC, Baum said. He said the group has members on school boards and
city councils. More than two dozen state legislators in Mississippi
belong to the group, Baum said.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Poverty Law Center published a paper in December
saying the CCC has ties to Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke and a
variety of neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups.
</P>
<P>
   Zeskind said the CCC plays the role of a ``bridge group'' that
connects openly racist right-wing groups to pragmatic politics.
</P>
<P>
   While Zeskind saw no evidence suggesting the CCC holds the
violent views or intentions of racist groups such as the neo-Nazi
Aryan Nation, its perspectives on race are much the same.
</P>
<P>
   The literature distributed by the CCC clearly advocates at least
a separation of the races. But Baum notes that it has never taken a
position on formal segregation.
</P>
<P>
   The columnist who wrote about nonwhites making the country ``a
slimy brown mass of glop'' was ``out of bounds,'' Baum said. But he
said the same writer, H. Millard, appropriately criticized
interracial marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``(A) genocide being carried out against white people hasn't
come with marching enemies,'' Millard wrote on the CCC's Web site.
``Instead it has come with propaganda that is calculated to
brainwash whites into willingly jumping into the Neo-Melting Pot...
Genocide via the bedroom chamber is just as long-lasting as
genocide via the gas chamber.''
</P>
<P>
   That sort of outlook prompted the Southern Poverty Law Center to
conclude ``the CCC has racism at its core.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not racism, Baum said, just a desire to preserve a
``white'' America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to keep this,'' he said, ``a predominantly European
country.''

UNION ROLLS EXPANDED IN 1998, FEDERAL LABOR AGENCY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Big labor's push to recruit new members yielded notable net
gains last year, even though union membership as a percentage of
total employment continued its downward slide.
</P>
<P>
   New data released Monday by the federal Bureau of Labor
Statistics showed a nationwide net gain of 101,000 union members,
increasing the number of unionized employees in the United States
to 16.2 million in 1998, up from 16.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the news was bittersweet: Despite labor's ongoing
recruitment campaign, the proportion of union employees in the
nation's work force dropped to 13.9 percent in 1998, from 14.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Increases in union membership did not keep pace with the
phenomenal job growth the nation experienced in 1998, during which
2.2 million new jobs were added to the economy. Specialists
attribute the lag in union membership growth to layoffs, plant
closings, and restructuring in the manufacturing sector, long a
bedrock of unionism. The labor movement must attract 300,000 to
400,000 new members each year to keep pace with the country's
growing work force.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders Monday hailed the boost in union membership,
noting that it marked the first major increase since 1994, when
142,000 new members were admitted into the union fold.
</P>
<P>
   That year, however, the overall proportion of union members in
the work force dropped 0.3 points to 15.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new data confirms that today's unions are on the right
track,'' said AFL-CIO president John Sweeney. ``Our commitment and
dedication to organizing, at all levels of the labor movement, is
beginning to bear fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Sweeney, the union federation spent millions of dollars on
an ambitious program to attract minorities, women, and other
employees in both the private and public sectors.
</P>
<P>
   The $35 million organizing effort included radio and television
ads, and recruiting efforts in Las Vegas hotels and casinos, at
nursing homes in the Northeast, and in strawberry fields in
California.
</P>
<P>
   One of the largest union organizing campaigns involved the
recruitment in 1998 of 19,000 United Airlines passenger service
employees by the International Association of Machinists.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, Massachusetts unions won 58 percent of their organizing
campaigns, up from 50 percent in 1997. In all, 36 Massachusetts
union chapters within the AFL-CIO, a national labor federation of
78 unions, brought about 10,000 new workers into unions.
</P>
<P>
   But even with those victories, the union movement has been
forced to shift its focus from the high-paying industrial jobs that
were its bread and butter in the 1950s to mostly low-income service
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of highly skilled manufacturing jobs has seriously
eroded membership and continues to chip away at union growth in the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Still, labor reported gains in the percentage of minorities
recruited in the past year. In all, 17.7 percent of all
African-American workers now belong to unions, compared to a
general work force that is 11.6 percent black. And, although the
percentage of Hispanic workers in the general work force grew by
4.1 percent in 1998, the percentage of union workers who are
Hispanic grew by 4.5 percent. Meanwhile, the number of women in
unions increased by 14,699 last year.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, 35 percent of the nation's private sector
employees were union members. In 1998, that percentage stood at 9.5
percent, down from 9.7 percent in 1997, according to US statistics.
In contrast, union membership among public sector employees
increased to 37.5 percent in 1998, from 37.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 373,000 workers were recruited by labor unions last
year. Of those, however, 213,000 held jobs in the public sector,
including the federal government. And although the labor movement
organized more than 300,000 new members, those gains were offset by
losses of union jobs in manufacturing and other sectors, resulting
in a net gain of 101,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is disasterous not to have more gains in the private
sector,'' Robert S.J. Ross, a labor expert at Clark University in
Worcester, Mass., said. ``It means that labor is still having
trouble making inroads in private employment. It also means that
more than 90 percent of American workers in the private sector are
not protected from arbitrary behavior'' on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Adams, organizing director for the national AFL-CIO,
attributed the gains to more organizing and to newly negotiated
contracts for members who might have been recruited some time ago
but did not hammer out agreements with their employers until last
year.

COMMENTARY: STARR'S STUNT  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Kenneth Starr intervened in the Senate trial of
President Clinton in a characteristic way. He acted in secret. He
went to the judge ex parte: without notifying the other side, the
president's side, or giving it a chance to oppose his motion.
</P>
<P>
   Starr persuaded the judge to issue an order requiring Monica
Lewinsky to appear for questioning by the House Republican
prosecutors of the president. But he inadvertently did something
else. He illuminated the profoundly anti-constitutional basis of
his position, and therefore of this impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution has no provision, in its impeachment clauses,
for an outside prosecutor to start the process of removing a
president from office. It has no provision for House managers in an
impeachment trial to use the fearsome powers of such a prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, here is a prosecutor, a member of the executive
branch, using unlimited resources to help one party in Congress
bring down a president of the other party. What could be a clearer
violation of a fundamental principle of our constitutional
structure, the separation of executive and legislative powers?
</P>
<P>
   A constitutional judgment has in a sense been delivered by the
American people. An overwhelming majority of the public disapproves
of Starr's conduct, as it does of removing the president from
office. I think that disapproval reflects a basic feeling that the
process has been so unfair as to offend our system.
</P>
<P>
   Much as people disliked Clinton's sordid behavior in the White
House, they disapproved of the way he was trapped by Starr and the
private wrong turned into a political assault. They did not like
Starr's abuse of Monica Lewinsky, her mother and other women.
</P>
<P>
   In legal terms, the case that Starr's role violates the
Constitution has become overwhelming. That is clear if one looks at
the language of the 1988 Supreme Court decision upholding the use
of an independent counsel to investigate an assistant attorney
general, Theodore Olson.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice Rehnquist, writing for the court, said there was
no violation of the separation of powers because ``this case does
not involve an attempt by Congress to increase its own powers at
the expense of the Executive Branch.'' The house managers' use of
Starr is precisely such an attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution allows Congress to have judges appoint
``inferior'' officials. Rehnquist said an independent prosecutor
was ``inferior'' because he could be ``removed by the attorney
general.'' But now, at least, it is politically impossible for
Attorney General Janet Reno to remove Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Rehnquist said, the independent counsel ``is empowered
by the act to perform only certain, limited duties,'' and his
office has limited tenure. He ``has no ongoing responsibilities
that extend beyond the accomplishment of the mission that (he) was
appointed for.'' To apply those descriptions to Kenneth Starr is to
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   When Starr intervened last Friday, I thought some Republican
senators would rise above party and express outrage at his
intrusion into their constitutional function. That they did not
showed how cynically partisan this impeachment is. That cynicism,
well understood by the public, corrupts our politics.
</P>
<P>
   Why did the House managers try the Monica Lewinsky caper? They
looked almost shamefaced as they told the Senate they just wanted
to meet her ``to shake hands, to say hello.'' Sure, in the presence
of prosecutors who can put her in prison for saying the wrong
thing.
</P>
<P>
   The managers' move was in part one of desperation, a hope that
something just might turn up if she and other witnesses testified.
And it pleased the right-wing forces that are the source of so much
Republican campaign money. They want to do as much damage to
President Clinton as possible. That was Kenneth Starr's objective
in his campaign of leaks last year. It is the purpose of the
attempt to have Monica Lewinsky testify from the well of the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   After the lawyers' arguments it is plain that the president has
not committed ``high crimes.'' For all the Republicans' talk of
``felonies,'' there is not a court in the country that would allow
the muddled perjury charge to stand. The question is how and when
this offense to the Constitution and common sense will end.

 &HT;    Republicans 'paring down to bare minimum' with witnesses
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When House Republican prosecutors make their case
for calling witnesses today, they will be arguing for far less
testimony than they had originally wanted.
</P>
<P>
   That's because in the face of increased skepticism over the need
for witnesses _ even from Republican senators _ the House
prosecutors are paring down their witness list.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to prioritize this and get down to the bare minimum
and not run the risk of getting zero witnesses because we put on
too many,'' said Rep. James Rogan, (R-Calif.), one of the 13
prosecutors from the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the prosecution's witness list is Monica Lewinsky,
the former White House intern, who is at the heart of the
controversy over whether the president lied under oath and
obstructed justice to conceal his affair with her.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Lewinsky, the prosecutors would like to hear from
presidential confidant Vernon Jordan; Oval Office secretary Betty
Currie; and perhaps White House aides John Podesta and Sidney
Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   The House prosecutors need 51 votes to call witnesses. With at
least seven Republicans now wavering, they could lose the motion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the slipping support for witnesses, the
prosecutors had to fend off another threat, Sen. Robert Byrd's
(D-West Va.) motion to dismiss the two articles of impeachment
against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) argued that the Senate was being
disrespectful of the less genteel House in attempting to end the
trial quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sort of feel we have fallen short in the respect side
because we represent the House, the blue collar people,'' Hyde
said. ``A trial, as I understand it, is a search for truth it
should not be a search for an exit strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of message does it send to America to dismiss
articles of impeachment?'' Hyde asked the senators as they heard
the White House counsel and the prosecutors argue Byrd's motion.
``These are charges that send ordinary people to jail.''
</P>
<P>
   And the House prosecutors faced yet another challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the day, a bipartisan plan was floated that would have
ended the trial without calling a single witness.
</P>
<P>
   That drew fire from the House prosecutors who have expressed
frustration that the Senate is more concerned about ending the
trial than hearing the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you have a trial without witnesses?'' Asked Rep. Bob
Barr (R-Ga.), one of the prosecutors, as he exited the closed-door
session with his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   The duty of the prosecution team is to uphold the Constitution
and ensure that justice is done, Barr said. ``Our responsibility is
to do the right thing, not the political thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson (R-Ark.) also argued that the Senate, which
counts his brother as a member, has a constitutional obligation to
hear from witnesses in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson and Reps. Ed Bryant of Tennessee and James Rogan of
California met with Lewinsky on Sunday to discuss what she might
say if called to testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the meeting was extraordinarily helpful,'' Hutchinson
said. ``She is a very impressive young lady.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lewinsky's lawyers said she did not reveal anything that is
not already part of the public record. So did the prosecutors
actually elicit new information from Lewinsky that would strengthen
the case?
</P>
<P>
   ``My goodness, I learned a great deal that was new,'' said
Hutchinson, declining to elaborate on what he learned. ``Even
though we want to bring this to a conclusion, we are engaged in a
process and we have a duty to see it through.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I would just as soon go home to my family, I would
like to leave this city and go back to Arkansas, (but) I have a
responsibility,'' Hutchinson said. ``Even though we all would like
to bring this to a conclusion, we have to do it in the right way,
following the Constitution, and it's step-by-step process that
should not be ended before the time is right.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said he was upset that the Senate
would rush to a conclusion without hearing from witnesses. There
are subtleties to the case that require the testimony of witnesses
to sort out, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that we follow the Constitution, not the political
moment,'' said Graham. ``To cut this trial short, to leave this
unchallenged will leave a lot of damage.''
</P>
<P>
   But the maneuvering over witnesses was uppermost on many of the
managers' minds.
</P>
<P>
   The only reason the prosecution is paring down its witness list
is to appease the Senate, said Barr, who expected a handful of
witnesses to be approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have essentially placed an artificial cap on witnesses,''
Barr said. ``I think they ought to leave it to us.''
</P>
<P>
   To artificially limit the prosecution, is inconsistent with a
thorough search for the truth, Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not in the Senate by invitation, we have a
Constitutional duty,'' Barr said. ``They (senators ) are constantly
going through ways to limit and thereby demean the work of the
house managers.''

&HT;        SPECTER BREAKS WITH MOST IN PARTY AND SUPPORTS OPEN SESSION
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Jan. 25, -- Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Arlen
Specter broke with a largely party-line vote and supported a motion
that would have opened to the public the debate over dismissing
impeachment charges against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Specter, along with Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, and
Susan Collins, R-Maine, were the only three Republicans to vote
Monday for the motion that failed 57 to 43.
</P>
<P>
   The motion, offered by Sens. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and Paul
Wellstone, D-Minn., sought to allow the public and the media to
watch the Senate's debate on whether to dismiss the obstruction of
justice and perjury charges against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Five Democrats and 52 Republicans, including Sen. Rick Santorum,
R-Pa., defeated the motion that needed the support of two-thirds of
the Senate to pass. The Senate then closed its doors and held the
debate in a closed session.
</P>
<P>
   Specter would not comment about his vote because he vowed not to
speak about the trial after being sworn in as a juror, said John
Ullyot, his spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the senator has said in the past that he would support
efforts to keep open up as much of the proceedings as possible,''
Ullyot said. ``He felt that when it comes to the debate on one of
the most important questions ever to face the Senate, the public's
right to know is something that should be respected.''
</P>
<P>
   Santorum's spokesman Robert Traynham, said the senator could not
be reached for comment about his vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he kept an open mind about whether to close the session
and didn't make his opinion known prior to his vote,'' Traynham
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania political observers said Specter was more free than
Santorum to break from the party because Santorum is up for
reelection in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Specter probably knew he was safe and the party had enough
votes to get its way,'' said Ray Wrabley, a political science
professor at University of Pittsburgh in Johnstown. ``It was sort
of a free vote for Specter.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrabley said both Republican Pennsylvania senators face a
difficult time, because they represent a state that supported
Clinton in his two presidential bids.
</P>
<P>
   But Wrabley said neither Specter nor Santorum are likely to be
hurt politically by their votes because the issue is considered
``procedural.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think folks have a short memory when it comes to procedural
votes,'' Wrabley said. ``Specter's and Santorum's vote on whether
to convict or not will be long-remembered. This vote will be
forgotten tomorrow in the bigger picture.''

<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ John William King had shed the bulletproof vest
he had worn into the county courthouse Monday and had on a
button-down shirt, untucked, its sleeves covering his racist
tattoos, even the Woody Woodpecker in a Ku Klux Klan cap.
</P>
<P>
   King, 24, the first of three white men to come to trial in the
gruesome death of James Byrd Jr., a 49-year-old black man dragged
to death on June 7 behind a pickup truck, clasped his hands and
glanced now and then at the teeming jury pool. His father, Ronald
L. King, a Jasper resident who had asked the town's forgiveness in
the days after the killing, sat quietly in a wheelchair in the back
of the second-floor courtroom, struggling to breathe through
emphysema-scarred lungs.
</P>
<P>
   The particularly brutal nature of Byrd's death, his body torn to
pieces and strewn along a rural roadway, summoned up images of past
lynchings and drew international attention to Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper residents and officials, from business owners to
ministers to politicians, say that while they are not exactly
looking forward to the renewed attention that the trial will bring,
they are convinced that the seven months since Byrd's death have
had a strangely tonic effect on this city of 8,500, tucked into the
piney woods of East Texas not far from the Louisiana line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The town's doing very well, considering what we've been
through,'' said Diane Domenech, president of the Jasper Chamber of
Commerce. ``We've definitely grown in unity because of what
happened, grown in trying to find ways to help each other out.''
</P>
<P>
   Long-buried grievances have been redressed, mistakes
acknowledged and fresh dialogues opened, officials say. Although
local tourism, built on bass fishing, may have been dealt a blow by
the publicity, said Nancy Nicholson, a City Council member, the
overall effect has been cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   A major moment of reconciliation came just last week, when a
rickety iron fence that for more than 100 years had separated the
black graves from the white ones in Jasper City Cemetery was
ceremoniously pulled down following a prayer vigil that drew 75
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in such bad shape,'' said the Rev. Ronald Foshage,
pastor at St. Michael's Catholic Church in Jasper, ``it didn't take
much to take it down. It was falling down. What impressed me was
how everyone was in favor of taking it down. Everyone. Well, if
there was any opposition, they kept it to themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether the unwritten but unvarying custom
of segregated graveyards will change.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown business leaders set up a table on the lawn of the
110-year-old courthouse Monday morning to sell maps of the city,
answer questions and pass out free bottled water to the dozens of
journalists and onlookers who showed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we are deeply grieved by the circumstance that brings
you to our town,'' their pamphlet read, ``we welcome you as our
guest, and we trust that you will find Jasper to be the warm,
hospitable, God-centered town that we have all come to love.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in the history of the Jasper County
Courthouse, metal detectors were set up at all entrances, and extra
deputies were hired to guard the doors and patrol the courthouse
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   King, who faces the death penalty if convicted, wore no shackles
in the courtroom; instead, an electronic security belt was fastened
around his waist to prevent his escape.
</P>
<P>
   Conducting three capital murder trials is a costly endeavor for
a small county, and officials said they were forced to raise local
property taxes by 12 percent to pay for it. This led King's lawyers
to ask for a change of venue, arguing that the tax increase would
make it impossible to draw an impartial jury. But Judge Joe Bob
Golden of state District Court ordered the trial to go ahead, and
prosecutors said they were confident an impartial panel could be
found.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors believe that very early on Sunday, June 7, Byrd was
picked up as he walked along a roadside by King and two other men,
Shawn A. Berry, 23, and Lawrence R. Brewer, 31. King and Berry had
gone to high school together and remained friends; Brewer met King
when both were in prison.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next is in dispute. The police say Berry told them
that King was upset that they had stopped to give a ride to a black
man and the situation had spun out of control. But King released a
statement from prison in November, over his lawyer's objections,
charging Berry with committing the murder over a failed drug
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Guy James Gray, the Jasper County Prosecutor, told prospective
jurors Monday that the authorities believed Byrd was alive when
dragged to his death _ ``like a boat pulling a skier'' _ behind
Berry's 1982 pickup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only was he alive,'' Gray said, ``he was conscious and he
was using his elbows and his body in every way he could to keep his
head and shoulders away from the pavement.''
</P>
<P>
   King's court-appointed lawyer, Haden Cribbs, told prospective
jurors that he opposed the death penalty and that they could, too.
If too many prospective jurors are rejected because they voice
opposition to the death penalty, Cribbs could renew his call to
move the trial out of Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   No trial dates have been set for Berry or Brewer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   From the beginning, residents said that the image the slaying
created of their town was a distorted one. Though the woods of East
Texas have a long history of racial trouble, Jasper had considered
itself a bit more laid-back and enlightened than some of its
rougher neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This town was never anything like some people thought when
they heard about what happened here,'' Ms. Domenech said.
</P>
<P>
   Local residents and officials, then, seemed happy that the
crowds of protesters and curiosity seekers who converged on Jasper
in the weeks after Byrd's slaying did not materialize Monday for
the opening of King's trial. ``There aren't really many people
here,'' Ms. Domenech said. ``Everything is calm, quiet. It's
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Television crews roamed the courthouse square all morning,
desperately chasing down the few residents who ventured into the
area and interviewing them.
</P>
<P>
   Court officers said that 203 residents of the county had been
summoned for jury duty, though fewer than 150 actually showed up.
Thick fog kept some away, while others were apparently averse to
becoming part of the high-profile case. By morning's end, after
several potential jurors had been excused for various reasons, the
pool was down to 122 people, 21 of them black. Blacks make up 20 to
25 percent of the population in the county, a slightly larger
percentage than that of the remaining jury pool. The prospective
jurors began filling out long questionnaires, and lawyers prepared
to question them, one by one, in a process expected to take up to
three weeks. Testimony will last for six to eight days, lawyers
estimated.
</P>
<P>
   One white prospective juror, Allen DeuFriend, 31, wandered out
of the courthouse and said that the judge had excused him, which
was fine with him. ``I've got a lot of family in this town,'' he
said. ``Nobody wants to get mixed up in a thing like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Within seconds he found himself backed up against a courthouse
wall by eight television crews and a firing squad of microphones.
``This is a good town,'' he said. ``There are a lot of good people.
This kind of thing could happen anywhere.''

CORPORATE SPONSORS PLEASED BY IOC'S MOVE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Large corporate sponsors of the Olympics reacted positively to
the International Olympic Committee's recommended expulsion of six
members Sunday and its acknowlegement of wrongdoing, and there
seems to be no call among the corporations for the resignation of
IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Samaranch should be given the chance to implement the
reforms,'' said David D'Alessandro, the president and chief
operating officer of the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., a
long-time sponsor of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the moment he is seen as not carrying through with them in
the future, he should be removed.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC is doing well, so far, to ameliorate a major crisis,
said D'Alessandro, who is among the toughest critics of Olympic
finance and business practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IOC went further than most people would have expected on
Sunday,'' D'Alessandro said. ``We were very encouraged by the
report because it didn't try to cover up any wrongdoing and it gave
a pretty good slap on the wrist to two of the major players on the
International Olympic Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  And while Samaranch's effort to follow through on reform
should be closely monitored by American corporations and others,
D'Alessandro said Samaranch's role in fostering and financing
athletics is enormous and not always fully appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   ``An all-out revolt that removed him now would be enormously
costly to small athletic groups, from impoverished African nations
right up to the United States,'' D'Alessandro said. ``If you
removed him from office, the source of an enormous, international
financing mechanism would simply dry up and, right now, there's
nothing to replace it. People don't understand that even the $100
million the US Olympic Committee receives as their share of
television rights is funneled down to small gyms and other tiny
athletic organizations around the country. And that's important
money that really keeps athletics going.''
</P>
<P>
   Other observers of the sports sponsorship industry agreed that
the IOC was moving to get its house in order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some companies are taking a bit of a wait-and-see attitude
before saying publicly that they will recommit to their
sponsorships but, so far, they seem to like what they have seen in
terms of the actions that have been taken and the reforms that have
been announced,'' said Lance Helgeson, of the IEG Sponsorship
Report, a Chicago publication that is considered the bible of the
sports sponsorship industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some companies may eventually pay a little less, if this is
not handled properly,'' Hegleson said. ``But the impact probably
will not be that great and, so far, from some of the companies we
have talked to, the IOC seems to be doing the right things.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Olympic brand is not worth what it used to be, then
companies aren't going to be willing to pay as much for
sponsorships as they have in the past,'' Hegleson added. ``They
want to be assured that things are on the up-and-up, and they think
the IOC is certainly at least on the right track.''

 &HT;    Trial of Lyons gets underway
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEARWATER, Fla. _ Smooth-talking schemer who bilked a pair of
Fortune 500 companies out of millions? Or a soul-saving Southern
preacher driven by a do-gooder's heart?
</P>
<P>
   State prosecutors and defense attorneys, as expected, outlined
starkly different pictures of the Rev. Henry Lyons in opening
statements Monday. Standing trial with former assistant Bernice
Edwards, Lyons is charged with laundering money that financed a
lavish lifestyle of luxury cars, diamonds and beach homes.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the National Baptist Convention USA, Lyons is the de
facto leader of hundreds of thousands of black Christians across
the South and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   One attorney said Lyons is revered in some circles as ``the
black pope.'' His influence as president of the NBC is at the core
of the complex case, which could last at least a month.
</P>
<P>
   Today's testimony could begin to home in on a central issue:
Whether Lyons solicited nearly $250,000 from the Anti-Defamation
League of B'nai B'rith. The group intended to help rebuild burned
black churches, but prosecutors claim Lyons put the money in a
personal bank account.
</P>
<P>
   The trial began Monday with the six-member, all-white jury
hearing a two-hour opening statement from assistant state attorney
Robert Lewis. Leading up to the trial, prosecutors had said Lyons
claimed he was a pawn of the white business world.
</P>
<P>
   But Grady Irvin, a black co-counsel on the Lyons defense team,
tried to deflate potential racial overtones.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case isn't about race,'' Irvin told jurors. ``This case
is about the National Baptist Convention and its president and the
customs and traditions of that organization.''
</P>
<P>
   One issue, Irvin conceded during his opening statement, is the
loose bookkeeping standards of the organization, formed in the
1880s. Irvin said Lyons _ who ran for NBC president in 1994 as a
reform candidate _ inherited a bank account of $34,000 to $38,000
and three or four sheets of legal paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The joke is that the headquarters is in the briefcase of
whoever the president is,'' Irvin said. ``Maybe that's not a good
thing for an organization of 8.5 million members.''
</P>
<P>
   Informal record keeping and bloated membership claims created an
atmosphere Lyons, 56, could exploit for personal profit,
prosecutors said. News reports before the trial, for example, said
membership apparently is closer to 1 million than 8.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Among the transactions in question are Lyons' dealings with the
Loewen Group, the world's second-largest funeral home group, and
with Globe Insurance. Lyons offered to sell Globe the NBC's mailing
list for $400,000, Lewis said. With the help of Edwards and a $99
database program, the prosecution contends, Lyons made up a
computerized list of random names.
</P>
<P>
   ``There ain't no list of the members of the NBC,'' Lewis said in
court.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys said Lyons has real influence among blacks and
that's why corporations courted him. Lyons held the key to a market
untapped by many companies: black America. ``His endorsement was
more important than Michael Jordan's,'' Irvin told jurors.

COMMENTARY: BROKEN CHINA  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Middle East in recent years has been renowned for its
ability to stay the same the more things change everywhere else.
Well, those days are over. The sound you hear from the Middle East
today is the sound of china breaking. The combination of geology
(falling oil prices), biology (a generation of leaders dying off)
and technology (the Internet and globalization) is starting to
transform the neighborhood. Consider a few recent developments:
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia is considering letting women drive. Why? Simple.
The ban on women getting behind the wheel has required Saudi Arabia
to import 500,000 male chauffeurs to drive Saudi women around. But
with oil revenues falling sharply, and the Saudi government looking
to save money, a Financial Times newsletter reports that Riyadh is
considering lifting the ban on lady drivers. ``With money tight,''
The FT reported, ``letting women drive if they want, and getting
rid of at least some of these (chauffeurs), saves a lot of money.''
With King Fahd ailing, and his brother Crown Prince Abdullah
running the show, Saudi Arabia also just announced that it was
extending basic Internet service to all major cities, ending the
practice whereby Saudis who wanted to get on the Web had to make a
long-distance call through neighboring Bahrain. This means Saudi
government control over information just went out the window.
</P>
<P>
   After much internal debate, Syria's president, Hafez Assad, has
decided to let certain selected Syrian businesses, ministries,
universities and hospitals have access to e-mail and the Internet _
but not the Syrian public. Indeed, Syrian intelligence services are
said to be randomly checking telephone lines to monitor if anyone
is sneaking onto the Web through Lebanon. This tentative Syrian
move to link with the Internet was driven by Assad's son Bashar,
whom Assad is grooming as his heir.
</P>
<P>
   Assad should have succession on the mind. When a crowd of Syrian
demonstrators, whom Assad organized, sacked the U.S. Embassy in
Damascus in December, the state-planned riot got out of control.
Syrian youths in the crowd started chanting anti-Assad slogans,
including the Arabic version of ``Long Live Saddam Hussein.''
Ooops.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Israel's defense minister, Yitzhak Mordechai, to
leave the Likud and run against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
marks the first time in Israel's history that an Oriental Jew will
be heading a centrist party dominated by Israeli WASP's (``White
Ashkenazi Sabra Paratroopers,'' according to the Jerusalem Report).
Mordechai left office Sunday accusing Netanyahu of deliberately and
dishonestly scuttling the peace process to curry favor with the far
right. Netanyahu denounced the Kurdish-born Mordechai as a ``closet
leftist.''
</P>
<P>
   Next door, Jordan's King Hussein returned from cancer treatment
at the Mayo Clinic and wasted no time in removing Crown Prince
Hassan, who has been Hussein's designated heir since 1965. Facing
his own mortality, the king apparently decided that the thoughtful
but aloof Hassan was not ready for prime time, and replaced him
with his populist 36-year-old son, Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   In Tehran, Iranian militants last week attacked a crowd of 5,000
Iranians who had gathered for a memorial service to mark the fourth
anniversary of the death of Mehdi Bazargan, Iran's first prime
minister after the shah was ousted by Islamic revolutionaries.
Honoring Bazargan, a moderate icon, was a finger in the eye to
Iran's current hard-line Islamic leadership. The crowd, which was
chanting ``Freedom of thought forever,'' was made up of supporters
of the moderate president, Mohammad Khatami, who is now fighting a
low-grade civil war with radical supporters of the country's
supreme religious guide and chief hard-liner, Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's hardline ayatollahs desperately need more oil revenue to
feed a rapidly growing population. But with oil prices falling, the
only place they can get cash to repair and expand Iran's oilfields
is primarily from U.S. oil companies. That investment won't be
forthcoming unless the regime changes its behavior. Coming soon to
Iran: Ayatollah Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   When geology, biology and technology all converge like this on
one region, things get really interesting. I make only one
prediction: You ain't seen nothin' yet.

INTEL BACKS OFF ON CHIP IDS; PRIVACY CONCERNS STILL VOICED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hoping to stave off a boycott of its microprocessors, Intel
Corp. Monday agreed to modify a feature in its newest chips that
could be used to identify computer users as they roam the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But privacy activists say the Intel plan isn't good enough, and
they'll promote a boycott of the company's chips until the
identification feature is entirely removed.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Intel said that its new Pentium III chips, set to go
on sale later this year, will contain a built-in electronic serial
number. When a Pentium III-equipped computer is connected to a
corporate computer network or the Internet, a server computer on
the network can read this ID number and identify particular
machines on the network.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a feature that many in the industry have asked for
years,'' said Intel spokesman Tom Waldrop.
</P>
<P>
   It would simplify the task of maintaining thousands of computers
on corporate networks. The system could also enhance network
security, since computers without the ID number could be blocked
from the network.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, merchants could use the ID numbers, along with
passwords, to enhance the security of on-line retailing. But
organizations that promote Internet privacy worry that the system
will make it impossible for people to use the Internet without
revealing their identities to businesses or government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Intel had sought to address these concerns in meetings with the
American Civil Liberties Union and other privacy activists. The
company decided to add a software control that would let the user
switch off the chip's ID feature. But privacy rights advocates said
that inexperienced users might not know how to switch off the ID
feature, or even realize that it exists.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Representative Ed Markey (D-Mass.), wrote to Intel
urging the company to modify the chip to protect the privacy of
users. ``I think that it's important to distinguish between
commercial security and personal privacy objectives,'' said Markey.
``The chip as it was going to be implemented would have advanced
the first goal but undermined the second.''
</P>
<P>
   A trio of privacy organizations _ the Electronic Privacy
Information Center, Junkbusters and Privacy International _ said
they would urge consumers to stop buying computers with Intel
processors until the company abandoned the ID system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel says it's putting in these features to promote
electronic commerce and network security. We understand that,''
said EPIC executive director Marc Rotenberg. ``But on the privacy
side, this has some very serious implications.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Intel sought to defuse the issue. The company now says
that it will ship Pentium III chips with the ID feature turned off.
A customer who wants to use it will be able to switch it on using a
piece of software included with new computers.
</P>
<P>
   Markey praised Intel's quick change of policy, while ACLU
associate director Barry Steinhardt called Intel's policy shift ``a
significant victory for consumer privacy. It would preserve the
best features of the Intel initiative . . . rather than creating
yet another tool to track users through the Internet.'' But EPIC's
Rotenberg isn't satisfied, and said the boycott is still on.
Rotenberg fears that as long as the capability is inside the chip,
hackers or government intruders could develop software to activate
it without the user's knowledge. ``We don't think a software patch
is good enough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear whether the boycott could have a significant impact
on sales of Intel-based computers. While the company dominates the
corporate computer market, it has faced intense competition from
rival chip makers Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Cyrix Corp. in
the home and small business markets.

   (1,500 words) The world's population is getting older. Over the
next few decades, rich countries will experience an unprecedented
growth in the number of their elderly and an unprecedented decline
in the number of their youth. Yet in the poor nations, population
is growing. This may do more to change our future than deadly

that Congress has been engaged in a spasm of sanctions
proliferation. This is false. We have three major foreign-policy

can the United States deal with terrorists, proliferators and
genocidal dictators? Sanctions may not be perfect and they are not
always the answer, but they are often the only weapon.

from which it would proceed to undermine Saddam's rule. But this
plan is militarily ludicrous and would almost certainly end in a
massive bloodbath. (slugged: BC-IRAQ-REBELS-INCOMPETENT -TWO-NYTSF)

   One more option for toppling Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq is
known as ``the Afghan approach.'' It stipulates that the United

CORPORATE SPONSORS PLEASED BY IOC'S MOVE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Large corporate sponsors of the Olympics reacted positively to
the International Olympic Committee's recommended expulsion of six
members Sunday and its acknowlegement of wrongdoing, and there
seems to be no call among the corporations for the resignation of
IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Samaranch should be given the chance to implement the
reforms,'' said David D'Alessandro, the president and chief
operating officer of the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., a
long-time sponsor of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the moment he is seen as not carrying through with them in
the future, he should be removed.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC is doing well, so far, to ameliorate a major crisis,
said D'Alessandro, who is among the toughest critics of Olympic
finance and business practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IOC went further than most people would have expected on
Sunday,'' D'Alessandro said. ``We were very encouraged by the
report because it didn't try to cover up any wrongdoing and it gave
a pretty good slap on the wrist to two of the major players on the
International Olympic Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  And while Samaranch's effort to follow through on reform
should be closely monitored by American corporations and others,
D'Alessandro said Samaranch's role in fostering and financing
athletics is enormous and not always fully appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   ``An all-out revolt that removed him now would be enormously
costly to small athletic groups, from impoverished African nations
right up to the United States,'' D'Alessandro said. ``If you
removed him from office, the source of an enormous, international
financing mechanism would simply dry up and, right now, there's
nothing to replace it. People don't understand that even the $100
million the US Olympic Committee receives as their share of
television rights is funneled down to small gyms and other tiny
athletic organizations around the country. And that's important
money that really keeps athletics going.''
</P>
<P>
   Other observers of the sports sponsorship industry agreed that
the IOC was moving to get its house in order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some companies are taking a bit of a wait-and-see attitude
before saying publicly that they will recommit to their
sponsorships but, so far, they seem to like what they have seen in
terms of the actions that have been taken and the reforms that have
been announced,'' said Lance Helgeson, of the IEG Sponsorship
Report, a Chicago publication that is considered the bible of the
sports sponsorship industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some companies may eventually pay a little less, if this is
not handled properly,'' Hegleson said. ``But the impact probably
will not be that great and, so far, from some of the companies we
have talked to, the IOC seems to be doing the right things.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Olympic brand is not worth what it used to be, then
companies aren't going to be willing to pay as much for
sponsorships as they have in the past,'' Hegleson added. ``They
want to be assured that things are on the up-and-up, and they think
the IOC is certainly at least on the right track.''

RUSSIA'S PRIME MINISTER PROPOSES SPLITTING POWERS WITH COMMUNISTS
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov tried on Monday to
solidify the Yeltsin government's hold on power, by proposing a new
agreement with the Communist-led parliament. It would remove the
cloud of impeachment that hangs over President Boris Yeltsin, in
the name of ensuring political stability.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement would give Primakov time to fill the top ranks of
the Kremlin with loyal subordinates, to tighten his control over
the government and to position himself as a plausible successor to
Yeltsin before elections that are scheduled for next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a move by Primakov to take power for himself,'' said
Mikhail Berger, editor of the newspaper Segodnya.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, Primakov hinted in a letter to parliamentary
leaders on Monday night that the agreement was his own initiative
and had yet to be fully coordinated with Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Since he was picked as prime minister in September, Primakov has
enjoyed broad popularity. He has co-opted much of the left-wing
opposition by naming Communists to key posts on economic policy. He
has also struck nationalist themes on foreign policy, even as he
has worked with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who is
visiting Moscow for talks on troubled American-Russian relations.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov has also tried to placate public opinion by
side-stepping tough economic decisions. Primakov's vague
endorsements of market economics may not please the International
Monetary Fund. But they have enabled him to mollify an electorate
that is deeply divided over Russia's tainted version of capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   But Primakov's honeymoon can only last so long and there are
already signs that it may soon end.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists in parliament have served notice that they may
call off the truce with the Primakov team they have helped to
shape. In order to cast themselves as the voice of the opposition,
the Communists need a government to oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Gennady Seleznyov, the communist speaker of the parliament, said
in an interview on Monday that if the economy continues to decline,
as almost everyone expects, the Communist-dominated body might
formally register a vote of ``no confidence'' in the Yeltsin
government in May.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Yeltsin's many physical ailments have only
contributed to the sense that there is a vacuum at the top that
needs filling _ and whetted the appetite of those that would like
to fill it.
</P>
<P>
   There are no shortage of presidential aspirants. Yuri Luzhkov,
the powerful mayor of Moscow, who has pressed for Yeltsin's
resignation and early presidential elections, is one. And just this
week, the film director and actor Nikita Mikhalkov, was endorsed
for president by the tycoon Boris Berezovsky.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Primakov's initiative on Monday appeared to be an effort to slow
the push for early elections, to fend off parliamentary challenges
and to protect his own position.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to parliamentary leaders, Primakov proposed a legal
agreement that would set a truce between Kremlin and the
parliament. Impeachment proceedings against Yeltsin would be
dropped. So would moves to orchestrate a parliamentary vote of ``no
confidence'' in the Kremlin leadership. In return, the president
would promise not to disband the parliament.
</P>
<P>
   There was talk of a similar agreement last year when Yeltsin was
promoting Viktor Chernomyrdin for prime minister. But it faded
among the bitter recriminations over Chernomyrdin's failed
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of Primakov's letter caught some here by surprise.
The letter led to speculation that Yeltsin may be sicker than the
Kremlin acknowledges or that Primakov has gained new latitude in
carrying out his government duties.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov and parliamentary leaders plan to meet next week to
discuss the proposal. While lawmakers have yet to publicly react,
they may seek a more far-reaching power-sharing arrangement,
including the right to approve the hiring and firing of ministers.
</P>
<P>
   If the proposal garners broad support in the legislature,
Primakov wrote, he will pursue it with Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``In case you agree with the proposed approach,'' Primakov
wrote, according to Russian news reports, ``I can coordinate the
draft with the president.''

 &HT;    Transportation authority plan announced
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gov. Roy Barnes set the stage Monday for what he has
projected as the battle of the session, proposing a new state
authority to control all transportation projects in 13 metro
Atlanta counties and, eventually, all areas of the state struggling
with air pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
   Some skeptical state lawmakers and local government officials
were hesitant to pick at the proposal, but they hinted that the
43-page bill introduced in the Senate will face some serious
questions and major tweaking attempts as it wends its way through
the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans already are looking critically at how the new,
15-member authority would finance its work. The independent agency
Barnes envisions could levy up to $2 billion in revenue bonds and,
with the approval of the Legislature or county leaders, create a
special tax district in each affected county.
</P>
<P>
   ``That'll be a significant sticking point,'' said House Minority
Leader Bob Irvin (R-Atlanta), who said GOP leaders will insist that
the bill require a public referendum before taxes are levied in the
special districts.
</P>
<P>
   And leading South Georgia lawmakers said Barnes is asking them
to ``step out on faith'' that the new authority and its emphasis on
cleaning up metro Atlanta's air quality problems won't jeopardize
road projects or other programs elsewhere in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already feel like we're not getting our share of scarce
resources in South Georgia,'' Lt. Gov. Mark Taylor said after
appearing at a news conference with Barnes to announce the
initiative. ``When the chips are down, rural Georgia has been there
for the capital city. We'll be there again as long as we're sure it
doesn't dry up all the transportation dollars in the state, and I
don't think it will.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the local government officials who will be most directly
affected by the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority gave
cautious support to the Barnes plan, which the governor has
described as the centerpiece of his legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks to me like it's a level playing field,'' said Wayne
Hill, chairman of the Gwinnett County Commission and the Atlanta
Regional Commission, the planning agency for metro Atlanta. ``As
long as it's a level playing field, I can't argue with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell praised Barnes. ``If we don't join
the effort, we're going to have people sitting in traffic for two
or three hours,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   After dribbling out details of the plan for weeks, Barnes hit
the issue head-on Monday, calling the press conference to explain
his first step to tackle some of Georgia's pressing environmental
issues _ traffic gridlock and the ensuing smog problems that
threaten to cut off all federal highway money to the metro Atlanta
region.
</P>
<P>
   According to Barnes' proposal, the new authority that he alone
would appoint has veto power over every road project in the
13-county area, and in other urban areas as they fall out of
compliance with federal air standards. Augusta, Columbus, Macon and
Albany are expected to join metro Atlanta within the next few years
as air quality problems in those cities persist.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to roads, GRTA also would have the power to plan and
operate a mass transit agency, coordinating with MARTA, Cobb
Community Transit and other existing systems while constructing new
components, like inter-city rail and a light rail link across the
northern arc of I-285. Barnes has provided some seed money for the
latter project in next year's budget.
</P>
<P>
   Those roles put the new agency in what could turn out to be a
direct power struggle with the state Department of Transportation
and the ARC, which now are responsible for transportation planning
and funneling money to approved projects. Under the new scenario,
both agencies, as well as cities and counties, would have to have
their plans approved by GRTA.
</P>
<P>
   The new transit agency also could step into some land-use
planning decisions, vetoing transportation spending for major
developments, like new malls or other projects with a significant
impact on the transportation network. Local officials, at the risk
of inviting more public scrutiny, could override that veto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully it'll never be used,'' Barnes said of the
authority's veto power. ``If the DOT, the ARC and local governments
can cooperate. . . we won't need this authority.''
</P>
<P>
   But since that's unlikely, Barnes has tooled into the bill
strong incentives for governments to cooperate. Those who flaunt
the authority's transportation plan face the loss of state grants
and revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a choice,'' Barnes said. ``We either address
this problem or this boon area _ this Atlanta region that has fed
the jobs and the tax coffers of the state. . . _ will suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   As he pitched the idea to mayors from across the state at a
Monday luncheon, Barnes spun the new transportation authority as a
way to help spread growth into areas of the state where development
and jobs are now lacking. The new governor pledged to continue
unimpeded road-building in those areas.
</P>
<P>
   In some areas, like Augusta, which is expected to fall into
non-compliance with federal clean air laws next year, officials
aren't sure about the one-size-fits-all solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to be so heavily weighted to transportation when
our problem seems to be industrial,'' said Augusta-Richmond County
Mayor Bob Young. ``We don't want the burden of compliance to fall
on people who drive automobiles. In Augusta, they contribute only
about a third of the problem.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Republicans rejected a Democratic proposal
on Monday to end the trial of President Clinton that would have
dispensed with witnesses and then would have moved to a debate on
articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they worked behind the scenes with the House Republican
prosecutors to draw up a witness list small enough to win a
majority vote in the Senate, where a few Republicans and almost all
Democrats do not want to hear witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuvering came as the Senate entered a decisive week,
heading toward a pair of critical votes on whether to dismiss the
case outright and whether to approve witnesses. The Senate debated
the first issue in a secret session Monday night, but votes will
come either Tuesday or Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, fearful of further partisan strife after the
weekend turmoil over the House questioning of Monica Lewinsky,
Sens. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., and Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., offered
both parties a proposal. They suggested that the votes on dismissal
and witnesses be skipped and that the trial move to closing debate,
with a vote on the articles of impeachment on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman described the plan as a ``mutual withdrawal of
forces'' under which Democrats would drop the effort to dismiss the
case outright and Republicans would not push for witnesses. It was
presented to the Democrats and Republicans at separate caucuses
Monday morning, and Sen. Tom Daschle, the minority leader,
announced that Democrats could support the plan.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the Republican caucus was still under way, John
Czwartacki, the spokesman for Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader,
said the idea had been ``summarily rejected.'' Republicans said
that their caucus was divided, with some people exhausted and leery
of witnesses but others still wanting to give the House prosecutors
the right to move forward with their case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard for me to envision as a trier of fact who has taken
an oath, judging this case, without seeing the most important
witness or witnesses,'' said Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio. Sen. Tim
Hutchinson, R-Ark., said there was a ``difference of opinion''
among Republicans over the need for witnesses. ``Everybody would
like this thing to end, and they hate to think of a couple of more
weeks of depositions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After rejecting the offer, Senate Republicans summoned some of
the House managers to the Capitol to winnow the prosecutors' list
of half a dozen witnesses down to two or three, in hopes that such
a list could win a majority vote later this week, perhaps even
winning some Democratic support.
</P>
<P>
   And to keep pressure on the White House, Lott and nine other
senators submitted 10 written questions to President Clinton,
taking advantage of an opening that the White House had given them
and then retracted on Saturday. They asked that he respond ``in
writing and under oath'' to the questions, which began by asking if
everything the president had testified to in the case brought by
Paula Jones was true.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not,'' the question continued, ``what did you testify to
that you now believe is not truthful? Please begin your answer with
a yes or no.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, said neither the
president nor his lawyers would respond to the questions, which he
said violated the bipartisan deal on trial procedures. ``I'd
suggest this has more to do with playing politics than with trying
to bring this to a fair and expeditious conclusion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the two parties once again parted ways, efforts
persisted to search for a bipartisan solution. Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, called Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., seeking support
for a two-person witness list and a date certain to end the trial.
After consulting Daschle, Kennedy relayed the message that the
Democrats were standing firm against witnesses, according to one
Democratic official.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One attempt at negotiation took place openly in front of a
cluster of reporters when Max Baucus, D-Mont., stopped abruptly in
the Senate's subway to ask Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, if the
Republicans had embraced the plan to move to the end of the trial.
``Could you think of an element that might help?'' Baucus asked.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley wondered in return whether Democratic opposition to
witnesses would extend to ``even a very circumscribed form for
witnesses, depositions, just a short period of time?'' Baucus said
it probably would, and the two men went their separate ways.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Facing a deadline of Tuesday to submit their witness list to the
Senate, the House managers _ a day after interviewing Ms. Lewinsky
_ began the day badly divided over how to proceed. Bowing to the
Senate's reluctance to call a large number of witnesses, some of
the prosecutors were willing to cull their list down to two or
three people, including Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But others continued to insist they needed to go beyond Ms.
Lewinsky and call a core group of five witnesses, to make their
case, including the White House aides and advisers Betty Currie,
Vernon Jordan, John Podesta, Sidney Blumenthal. There was also
interest in Clinton's former political consultant, Dick Morris.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate is over who should be added and whether they'd be
accepted by the Senate,'' Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., said after a
midday meeting of the prosecutors. ``We believe in our case and we
want a way to present it, and we're going to keep arguing that
point to the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as the meeting was ending, some of the prosecutors,
including Hutchinson and Rep. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina,
were summoned to a Capitol office by a small group of Senate
Republicans, including Sen. Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania
Republican, to discuss the witness issue.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By Monday night, the four prosecutors who will make the case for
witnesses on Tuesday _ Hutchinson, James Rogan of California, Ed
Bryant of Tennessee and Bill McCollum of Florida _ were paring down
the list, and one Republican aide said there would probably be no
more than three submitted to the Senate. Even earlier in the day
Rogan had signaled that they would move in this direction. ``We've
got to prioritize and get down to a bare minimum and not run the
risk of getting zero witnesses because we put on one too many,'' he
said.
</P>

   Other than Ms. Lewinsky, it was not certain which witneses the
prosecutors would settle on. They were to meet again on Tuesday
before the session.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate went into closed session Monday night to debate the
motion by Sen. Robert Byrd to dismiss the trial. But the pair of
votes on that motion and on witnesses are not expected until late
Tuesday night or Wednesday. Lott said confidently that the
Republicans who control the chamber 55-45 ``have the votes'' to
block dismissal of the case.

<P>

<P>
   And suggesting that even some Democrats might oppose dismissal,
Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., tried unsccessfully to have the vote
on stopping the case, separated into two votes, one for each
article of impeachment.

<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It was less certain how the Senate will vote on witnesses.
Several Republicans have expressed unease at extending the trial by
calling the principals in the case. But it was not clear how many
of them would vote with Demcrats against witnesses. If all 45
Democrats hold together to oppose witnesses, then six Republicans
are needed to prevent further testimony. And some of the wavering
lawmakers are likely to be swayed by the scope of the House witness
list.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody can show me that this will change the dynamics of
the trial,'' said Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., ``that's a different
story. I don't believe that's going to happen. But I haven't closed
my mind totally yet.'' He said a number of Republicans shared his
concern.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were also exploring whether they could end the trial
by voting on a statement of facts on each of the articles of
impeachment and then separately on the articles themselves. That
would allow senators to make a statement that Clinton had committed
perjury and obstructed justice as the House charged, but not to
remove him from office. Democrats said they would oppose such a
plan as unconstitutional.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Republicans rejected a Democratic proposal
on Monday to end the trial of President Clinton that would have
dispensed with witnesses and then would have moved to a debate on
articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they worked behind the scenes with the House Republican
prosecutors to draw up a witness list small enough to win a
majority vote in the Senate, where a few Republicans and almost all
Democrats do not want to hear witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuvering came as the Senate entered a decisive week,
heading toward a pair of critical votes on whether to dismiss the
case outright and whether to approve witnesses. The Senate debated
the first issue in a secret session Monday night, but votes will
come either Tuesday or Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, fearful of further partisan strife after the
weekend turmoil over the House questioning of Monica Lewinsky,
Sens. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., and Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., offered
both parties a proposal. They suggested that the votes on dismissal
and witnesses be skipped and that the trial move to closing debate,
with a vote on the articles of impeachment on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman described the plan as a ``mutual withdrawal of
forces'' under which Democrats would drop the effort to dismiss the
case outright and Republicans would not push for witnesses. It was
presented to the Democrats and Republicans at separate caucuses
Monday morning, and Sen. Tom Daschle, the minority leader,
announced that Democrats could support the plan.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the Republican caucus was still under way, John
Czwartacki, the spokesman for Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader,
said the idea had been ``summarily rejected.'' Republicans said
that their caucus was divided, with some people exhausted and leery
of witnesses but others still wanting to give the House prosecutors
the right to move forward with their case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard for me to envision as a trier of fact who has taken
an oath, judging this case, without seeing the most important
witness or witnesses,'' said Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio. Sen. Tim
Hutchinson, R-Ark., said there was a ``difference of opinion''
among Republicans over the need for witnesses. ``Everybody would
like this thing to end, and they hate to think of a couple of more
weeks of depositions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After rejecting the offer, Senate Republicans summoned some of
the House managers to the Capitol to winnow the prosecutors' list
of half a dozen witnesses down to two or three, in hopes that such
a list could win a majority vote later this week, perhaps even
winning some Democratic support.
</P>
<P>
   And to keep pressure on the White House, Lott and nine other
senators submitted 10 written questions to President Clinton,
taking advantage of an opening that the White House had given them
and then retracted on Saturday. They asked that he respond ``in
writing and under oath'' to the questions, which began by asking if
everything the president had testified to in the case brought by
Paula Jones was true.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not,'' the question continued, ``what did you testify to
that you now believe is not truthful? Please begin your answer with
a yes or no.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, said neither the
president nor his lawyers would respond to the questions, which he
said violated the bipartisan deal on trial procedures. ``I'd
suggest this has more to do with playing politics than with trying
to bring this to a fair and expeditious conclusion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the two parties once again parted ways, efforts
persisted to search for a bipartisan solution. Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, called Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., seeking support
for a two-person witness list and a date certain to end the trial.
After consulting Daschle, Kennedy relayed the message that the
Democrats were standing firm against witnesses, according to one
Democratic official.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One attempt at negotiation took place openly in front of a
cluster of reporters when Max Baucus, D-Mont., stopped abruptly in
the Senate's subway to ask Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, if the
Republicans had embraced the plan to move to the end of the trial.
``Could you think of an element that might help?'' Baucus asked.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley wondered in return whether Democratic opposition to
witnesses would extend to ``even a very circumscribed form for
witnesses, depositions, just a short period of time?'' Baucus said
it probably would, and the two men went their separate ways.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Facing a deadline of Tuesday to submit their witness list to the
Senate, the House managers _ a day after interviewing Ms. Lewinsky
_ began the day badly divided over how to proceed. Bowing to the
Senate's reluctance to call a large number of witnesses, some of
the prosecutors were willing to cull their list down to two or
three people, including Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But others continued to insist they needed to go beyond Ms.
Lewinsky and call a core group of five witnesses, to make their
case, including the White House aides and advisers Betty Currie,
Vernon Jordan, John Podesta, Sidney Blumenthal. There was also
interest in Clinton's former political consultant, Dick Morris.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate is over who should be added and whether they'd be
accepted by the Senate,'' Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., said after a
midday meeting of the prosecutors. ``We believe in our case and we
want a way to present it, and we're going to keep arguing that
point to the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as the meeting was ending, some of the prosecutors,
including Hutchinson and Rep. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina,
were summoned to a Capitol office by a small group of Senate
Republicans, including Sen. Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania
Republican, to discuss the witness issue.

</P>
<P>
   By Monday night, the four prosecutors who will make the case for
witnesses on Tuesday _ Hutchinson, James Rogan of California, Ed
Bryant of Tennessee and Bill McCollum of Florida _ were paring down
the list, and one Republican aide said there would probably be no
more than three submitted to the Senate. Even earlier in the day
Rogan had signaled that they would move in this direction. ``We've
got to prioritize and get down to a bare minimum and not run the
risk of getting zero witnesses because we put on one too many,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Ms. Lewinsky, it was not certain which witnesses the
prosecutors would settle on. They were to meet again on Tuesday

WORKERS NOT OWED A SHARE OF PENSION SURPLUSES, COURT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., N.Y., Ala.)  (mk) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Companies do not have to share surpluses in their pension plans
with their workers, even if the workers contributed to the plans
through money withheld from their paychecks, the Supreme Court
ruled unanimously Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Pension experts on the employer side hailed the decision as
either a great victory for management or a confirmation of
established law. Those who represent workers said the decision
showed how a 1974 federal law intended to protect workers' benefits
had been twisted into a tool to restrict those benefits while
enriching corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came in a case involving Hughes Aircraft and its
corporate successors: Hughes Electronics, a subsidiary of General
Motors Corp., and Raytheon Co. Other companies that have been named
in similar pension litigation include General Electric and
Georgia-Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was a type of defined-benefit, or traditional, pension
plan in which both the company and its workers contribute money.
About $60 billion of the $2 trillion in defined-benefit pension
assets are in such contributory plans, pension experts said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Money deducted from workers' pay provided about half of the
contributions to the Hughes plan before 1986. It was then that the
company stopped making contributions because investment gains had
created a $1 billion surplus. Workers were required to contribute
until 1991, when the company gave them the option of continuing
their contributions or switching to a plan in which they made no
contributions but stood to receive smaller benefits. The company
also started using the surplus to finance pension benefits for new
workers, who did not have to contribute to their pensions.
</P>
<P>
   Five retired workers from Arizona sued in U.S. District Court in
1992, saying that because Hughes had made such extensive changes to
the plan, it had been effectively terminated. Under the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, when a plan with a surplus
is terminated, workers get a share of the surplus. The workers
figured that under a terminated plan their benefits would increase
by as much as 25 percent, said their lawyer, Jerome Tauber of
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said that as long as it paid the retirees the benefits
they were promised it was free to use the surplus to reduce its
pension expenses for other workers.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in Arizona threw out the lawsuit, but the 9th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a trial should be held.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Clarence Thomas, who wrote the Supreme Court opinion
reversing the appellate court, said the retirees ``proceed on the
erroneous assumption that they had an interest in the plan's
surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   What the workers bought with their contributions, the court
held, was not a share of the pension plan's investment gains but a
guarantee that they would earn a defined benefit based on their
years of employment and their salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The 1991 changes to the plan, Thomas wrote, ``did not affect the
rights of pre-existing plan participants, and Hughes did not use
the surplus for its own benefits.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jay Waks, senior pension partner at the Kaye Scholer law firm in
New York, who represents companies in pension disputes, said the
decision ``is a sterling victory for employers who have overfunded
their defined-benefit pension plans.'' The decision removes any
doubt about the freedom of companies to use surplus pension assets
as they deem best, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Ugoretz, president of the Erisa Industry Committee, a
Washington-based trade organization, was more restrained, saying
that the court had ``simply affirmed existing law that was
understood by everybody except these plaintiffs and their lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that workers who contributed to the plan did not buy the
right to bigger benefits if the plan achieved a surplus but rather
``the guarantee that they would get paid their promised benefits
even if we were in a deep depression.''
</P>
<P>
   He estimated that only 5 percent of defined-benefit plans run by
individual companies ever had a requirement that workers contribute
and that such plans were rare now. ``Today a company that wants
workers to contribute would probably have a 401(k) plan,'' Ugoretz
said. In 401(k) plans, workers assume all investment risks.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Ferguson, executive director of the Pension Rights Center,
a workers' advocacy organization, said the high court had endorsed
``one more corporate sleight of hand to siphon off pension plan
surplus for corporate purposes instead of requiring that it be used
for the employees, who by law are supposed to be the sole and
exclusive beneficiaries.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the surplus represented, in part, inflated dollars that
the workers should receive because their pension checks are in
fixed amounts whose value has been eroded by inflation. ``The
decision is fundamentally unfair,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Stein, who teaches pension law at the University of
Alabama, said, ``This was a plan funded by the employees with their
money, and to say that the employees don't have an interest in
their own money is absurd.''

OUT OF THE PUBLIC EYE, SENATE DEBATES WHETHER TO END TRIAL

 By R.W. APPLE, Jr.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With doors closed to the public and television
cameras switched off, the Senate debated Monday night whether to
dismiss all charges against President Clinton and bring his
impeachment trial to an end.
</P>
<P>
   The debate began after a bid by two Democrats to override the
rules and hold the debate in public view failed to muster the
two-thirds vote required or even a simple majority. The move was
voted down, 43-57, with most Republicans favoring a secret session
and most Democrats an open one.
</P>
<P>
   In the modern era, closed sessions are normally held only when
classified information is discussed. The last one in the Senate was
a debate on the Chemical Weapons Convention on April 24, 1997. But
rules governing impeachment trials date from the mid-19th century,
when senators were not yet directly elected, when the notion of
open government had no great popular appeal and when, of course,
radio and television had not been invented.
</P>
<P>
   Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the Senate's senior Democratic
member, submitted a motion Monday afternoon to bring the trial to
an immediate conclusion. There followed a period of parliamentary
confusion and maneuvering that at one point prompted Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist, who is presiding over the trial, to ask an
adviser in a stage whisper, ``What do we do now?''
</P>
<P>
   When the procedural knot was finally untied, the Republican
prosecutors, or managers, and defense lawyers began arguments on
dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the Senate for the first time, Nicole K. Seligman,
one of the president's private lawyers, argued that ``the moment
has arrived where the best interests of the nation, the wise
prescription of the framers and the failure of the managers' proof
all point to dismissal.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``The case can not be made. It is time to end it.''
</P>
<P>
   The lead prosecutor, Rep. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill., said in
rebuttal that if the Senate cut off the trial, it would have
``summarily dismissed, disregarded, ignored, brushed off'' charges
of perjury and obstruction of justice that sent ordinary people to
jail almost every day. The motion, he said, was ``a legal way of
saying `So what?' to the charges we've levied.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde betrayed some bitterness at the way the managers' case has
been received by the Senate during the trial. He and his colleagues
had not been treated with much respect, he said, ``because of the
fact that we represent the House, the other body, kind of
blue-collar people, and we're over here trying to survive with our
impeachment articles.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's motion, Hyde declared, ``elevates convenience over
constitutional process.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to vote on the dismissal motion on
Tuesday or Wednesday, with only a simple majority required for
approval. Few predict that it will pass, but Byrd and his allies
hope to get 40 votes or more to demonstrate fairly definitively
that the two-thirds vote required for conviction is beyond the
reach of the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi said he already
had enough votes in hand to defeat Byrd's proposal, and no Democrat
challenged him.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's roll call on opening the debate to the public, the
first vote of the trial, party lines did not hold precisely, which
suggested to some that perhaps the Senate was not so thoroughly
polarized as feared. Sens. Tom Harkin of Iowa and Paul D.
Wellstone, both Democrats, proposed the rule change.
</P>
<P>
   Forty Democrats voted to override the rules, which date from the
impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson, 131 years ago, and
open the debate. They were joined by three Republicans _ Arlen
Specter of Pennsylvania and Susan Collins of Maine, both moderates,
and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, who is considered more
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Specter's deputy chief of staff, John Ullyot, later said his
boss felt ``it's only natural that the American people should be at
the deliberations'' on such an issue.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-two Republicans voted to keep the session secret, many of
them because their leadership feared that the Senate's carefully
cultivated image of dignity and bipartisanship would suffer if the
debate was public.
</P>
<P>
   Five Democrats voted not to open the deliberations, including
Blanche L. Lincoln of Arkansas, just beginning her first term; Max
Baucus of Montana, Paul S. Sarbanes of Maryland and both of
Virginia's senators, Byrd and John D. Rockefeller IV.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that we be able to let our hair down,'' Byrd
declared afterward. ``We will say things in a closed session that
are really what we're thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that open sessions would have invited ``grandstanding
and party wrangling,'' Baucus said that ``when it comes to the
final Senate deliberations in this trial, I believe the best course
for senators, like jurors and judges, to deliberate privately and
avoid partisanship.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the roll call had ended, Rehnquist called out from
the dais, ``The sergeant at arms will please close the doors.''
</P>
<P>
   One element in the parliamentary maneuvering that began the day
gave a small clue to the future. Sens. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., and
Ms. Collins, the Maine Republican, moved unsuccessfully to split
Byrd's motion in two, so that they could vote separately on whether
to dismiss the impeachment article dealing with perjury or the one
covering obstruction of justice. Both, it was reported, want to
carry the obstruction article forward so they can hear testimony
from the president's secretary, Betty Currie, a key figure in
several of the incidents involved in alleged obstructions.
</P>
<P>
   The effort failed, but it suggested that Feingold might vote
against Byrd's motion, which is favored by almost all the Senate
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In the summing-up that preceded the closing of the doors, for
which each side was allotted an hour, Rep. Charles T. Canady,
R-Fla., led off for the prosecutors. He urged the Senate to
remember that never in the 200-year history of the Constitution had
there been a decision to dismiss a proceeding against any official,
whether president or judge, ``who remained in office after
impeachment by the House of Representatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Canady revisited a number of the constitutional arguments made
by the prosecutors over the last two weeks, but he added a new one.
Defense lawyers have argued that while judges might be removed for
perjury or such crimes, convicting a president required a higher
standard because it involved overturning an election.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Seligman so argued Monday, asserting that ``any question,
any doubt, must be resolved in favor of the electoral will.'' She
argued that ``the doubt here is pervasive,'' and that ``doubt upon
doubt upon doubt makes a vote to dismiss the only fair choice.''
</P>
<P>
   But Canady noted that in 1995 the Senate had been on the point
of dismissing one of its members, Sen. Bob Packwood, D-Ore., also
an elected official, when he resigned. His offenses, the Floridian
said, were similar to those charged against Clinton, as described
by the Ethics Committee: illegal acts that ``constitute a violation
of his policy of trust to the Senate and an abuse of his position
as a United States senator.''

 &HT;    Bush plans 'opportunity scholarships' for children in Florida's
private schools
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE _ As early as the fall, children in failing public
schools could be eligible for thousands of dollars to attend
private schools under a plan announced Monday by Gov. Jeb Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning, however, it became apparent that Bush wasn't
planning to use the ``V-word'' (vouchers).
</P>
<P>
   ``What?'' Bush said. ``You mean opportunity scholarships?''
</P>
<P>
   By any name, they represent the most politically combustible
aspect of Bush's ``A-plus'' education proposal to increase K-12
spending $643 million, or 6.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Drafted largely by Lt. Gov. Frank Brogan, the former state
education commissioner, the plan would also start a pilot program
to raise the compulsory attendance age from 16 to 18; try to stop
``social promotion;'' and pay up to $100 per student to schools
that excel or improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opportunity scholarships'' would cost nothing because the
state would give private schools no more than was being spent
already, Bush and Brogan claim, adding they hope they aren't needed
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and teachers' unions criticized the plan for failing
to reduce class size or eliminate a textbook shortage, while
threatening to take money away from troubled schools that need it
most.
</P>
<P>
   ``One section in Bush's A+ proposal deserves a failing grade,''
said Senate minority leader Buddy Dyer, D-Orlando. ``Bush's plan
includes vouchers, but calls it another name.''
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, School Superintendent Joan Kowal liked much of
what Brogan told her Monday in a morning conference call with
Florida's superintendents. She said she was heartened by his focus
on teacher training, school safety, accountability and improving
student achievement. But much of it was familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly believe teachers and educators are very willing to
be held accountable,'' she said. ``I want every school to grow into
a high-performing school.''
</P>
<P>
   She had mixed feelings on Bush's call for an end to social
promotion. On the one hand, there are basic skills that every
students should know before moving on. On the other hand, she wants
something more flexible than depending on answers on one
standardized test to decide whether that student is ready.
</P>
<P>
   And Kowal has never been a supporter of vouchers. She has said
it doesn't do much good for those low-performing schools losing
students to private or higher-performing public schools. But she
held her tongue Wednesday, saying she wanted to see what Bush and
Brogan proposed exactly.
</P>
<P>
   District legislative lobbyist Vernon Pickup-Crawford said that
vouchers were the wrong direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has not been anything that absolutely says, `By God,
this is working and we need to do it more,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was quite open about his plans for scholarships during the
campaign, and won handily. He and Brogan say it's time to try new
ideas if schools don't get better.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it would work: If a public school flunks state
standards and fails to improve in a year, parents could choose
where to send their kids to another school, private or public, with
state money.
</P>
<P>
   The scholarships could be awarded as early as this fall in four
troubled districts on the state's bad performance list: two in
Escambia County, one in Gadsden and one in Orange.
</P>
<P>
   In Palm Beach County, scholarships would amount to $3,896 per
student.
</P>
<P>
   That would not cover the annual cost of many private schools,
including $12,000 at St. Andrew's School in Boca Raton, $5,000 at
Cardinal Newman High School in West Palm Beach and $4,400 at John
Carroll in Fort Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at those schools said they were still studying the
plan or could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   To participate, private schools ``must agree to accept all
eligible students,'' a Bush policy paper says. It doesn't define
eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was joined by a number of legislators who said they support
his plan, though Senate President Toni Jennings, for one, reserved
judgment on the school choice portion. Senate leaders are pushing a
$300 million plan to lower class size.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not at a point where she is prepared to say yes or no on
vouchers or opportunity scholarships,'' said Jennings spokeswoman
Edie Ousley. ``She's pleased Jeb Bush has put education at the top
of his priority list.''

 WASHINGTON: administration's behalf.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   While redistricting _ as opposed to apportionment _ is a matter
for the individual states, and not for the federal government, all
50 states have laws or constitutional provisions requiring their
legislatures to use federal census figures in drawing district
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Because control of the House after 2000 is likely to depend more
on the outcome of redistricting in every state than on the
apportionment of the House, in which only a handful of
congressional seats were thought to be at stake, the question of
whether states will have access to adjusted numbers is highly
charged one. ``The battle has just begun,'' said Rep. Carolyn B.
Maloney of New York, the senior Democrat on the House census
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's statistical-sampling plan was challenged in
two separate Supreme Court cases, one brought by Republicans in the
House of Representatives and the other by taxpayers in six states..
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration had argued vigorously that neither
set of plaintiffs faced the kind of concrete injury necessary to
get into court. The court on Monday said that the taxpayers _ from
Connecticut, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Pennsylvania and
Wisconsin _ had legal standing to sue, but it dismissed the House
suit as unnecessary to its resolution of the issue, without
addressing the legal standing of the representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Glavin, president of the Southeastern Legal Foundation, a
conservative public-interest law firm based in Atlanta that brought
together the taxpayer plaintiffs, said on Monday that the decision
would ``protect the integrity of the census.'' He said he would
file another lawsuit if the administration sought to make adjusted
figures available for redistricting purposes.
</P>
<P>
   There is no dispute that the last census, using forms mailed to
every household and follow-up visits from census takers to those
who did not respond, missed some 4 million people, or 1.6 percent
of the country's population. But as Breyer pointed out in a
separate opinion on Monday, the undercount would make little
difference if it were spread evenly across the population.
</P>
<P>
   However, the census disproportionately misses members of
minority groups living in low-income areas, while double-counting
affluent people who own more than one home.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau had proposed two statistical methods of making
the count more accurate while, at the same time, saving money.
President Clinton vetoed a bill Congress passed in 1997 to bar any
statistical adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   A tangle of statutory language has grown up over the years,
reflecting in part congressional acquiescence to the Census
Bureau's longstanding desire to use statistical methods to get more
accurate data outside the apportionment area. In 1976, Congress
amended the Census Act of 1954 to allow the secretary of commerce
to conduct the census ``in such form and content as he may
determine, including the use of sampling procedures and special
surveys.''
</P>
<P>
   Another section of the law, however, had since 1957 provided
that the secretary could use sampling ``except for the
determination of population for apportionment purposes.'' Congress
in 1976 amended that section to provide that the secretary ``shall,
if he considers it feasible,'' use sampling for these purposes.
</P>
<P>
   In her opinion on Monday, Justice O'Connor said that these
various provisions had to be read as a whole, in a context in which
Congress had always insisted on a head count for apportionment
purposes even as it became more interested in sampling for other
purposes. For purposes other than apportionment, she said, sampling
was now required, while prohibited as a substitute for the
apportionment enumeration.
</P>
<P>
   In his dissenting opinion, Stevens read the statutory language
differently as making clear that sampling for apportionment, while
not required, was nonetheless permitted, in the secretary's
discretion.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer took a singular position in his separate opinion. While
he agreed with the majority that sampling could not be a substitute
for an actual enumeration, the approach the administration had
proposed was not a substitute but a permissible ``supplement'' that
would ``achieve the very accuracy that the census seeks and the
Census Act itself demands.''

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Services for Jimmy Day, whom a fellow musician
called ``the greatest steel guitar player who ever lived, bar
none,'' will be at 3 p.m. Wednesday in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Day, who lived in Buda, Texas died Friday in a Houston hospital
at age 65. Friends said the cause of death was cancer.
</P>
<P>
   During his career, he played shows and recorded with Webb
Pierce, Elvis Presley, George Jones, Ray Price, Jim Reeves, Willie
Nelson and Hank Williams Sr.
</P>
<P>
   Said his friend, the Rev. Dave Rich of Dallas, who was himself a
recording artist, ``He played with everybody who ever had any kind
of name at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Day was born Jan. 9, 1934, in Tuscaloosa, Ala., and began his
professional career with the Louisiana Hayride in the early 1950s.
His style ``completely revolutionized the pedal steel guitar,''
said Rich, who recorded for RCA during the '50s.
</P>
<P>
   Day was inducted into the International Steel Guitar Hall of
Fame, the Alabama Country Music Hall of Fame, the Texas Steel
Guitar Hall of Fame and the Texas Western Swing Hall of Fame. Next
month, his name will join the Texas Branch of the Country Music
Association Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Herb Steiner of Austin, a steel guitar player formerly with
Asleep at the Wheel, called Day ``the true master of soul. Nobody
had the raw, bleeding nerve endings hanging out of his heart when
he played like Jimmy Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Day had lived in the Austin area, on and off, since the early
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Rich said Day had ``a real lovable personality. He was very
witty. He had a powerful, great sense of humor, and he was still
showing that four or five days before he died,'' when Rich visited
him in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Day is survived by his wife, Marilyn Day, of Buda; daughters
Marla Lea Day of Buda and Judy Lindsey of Lincoln, Neb.; sons Jimmy
Day Jr. of Shreveport, La., Clay Day of Rockmart, Ga., and Chris
Day of Nashville, Tenn.; sister Patricia Davis of Shreveport;
brothers Joe Thomas Day Sr. of Livingston and Lee Franklin Day of
Shreveport; and two granddaughters.

SECRET SESSION COULD HURT GOP, OBSERVERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate's decision to hold a closed-door session
drew criticism from historians, legal scholars, and political
scientists who predicted the Republican Party will suffer as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is extraordinary,'' said John McGregor Burns, a
presidential historian. ``I think the American people are anxious
to get this over, but they're pursuing it with much more interest
than they're willing to admit . . . and I don't expect they'll be
very pleased with this turn of events.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns and other analysts acknowledged that the Senate was within
its constitutional right to deliberate in secret, as it did during
the presidential impeachment trial of Andrew Johnson more than a
century ago.
</P>
<P>
   But they argued that the world has changed so radically since
then _ with the advent of television and open-meeting laws at every
level of government _ that people have become accustomed to having
their elected officials work in public, even if they don't watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much has changed in the last 131 years that you'd think the
Senate would acknowledge it,'' said historian Doris Kearns Goodwin.
``We have a far more open society, with all its faults, but it has
many more benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said it would be ironic if Americans who have long
said they have seen enough of the impeachment process were to
complain about being shut out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a case of `Be careful what you ask for,' '' said Carol
Chase, a law professor at Pepperdine University in California.
However, she said there is a difference between choosing not to
observe and being denied the opportunity to do so.
</P>
<P>
   She said voters probably will be more upset with GOP lawmakers
than polls already indicate they are. ``What do they have to gain
by closing the debate, other than to arouse suspicion about their
motives?'' asked Chase.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 57-43, the Senate defeated a motion by Senator Tom
Harkin, an Iowa Democrat, to open the debate on dismissing the
charges against President Clinton. Five Democrats joined the GOP
majority in voting to close the debate, while three Republicans
agreed with most Democrats to open the session.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the result was sufficiently partisan to cast the
process as a standoff. And the observers said that could hurt the
GOP politically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this whole thing has become a runaway freight train,''
said Robert Dallek, a presidential historian at Boston University.
He predicted the decision to debate privately would ``add to the
distrust'' that many Americans feel about the Republicans in
Congress, and heighten their sense that all lawmakers ``are a
secretive bunch of manipulators.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion of undermining the public's faith in government was
repeated again and again by those interviewed. Particularly since
most voters apparently want Clinton to remain in office, and
disapprove of the impeachment proceedings against him, analysts
said, it will appear to many that the senators chose to go behind
closed doors because they knew they were holding discussions that
would draw complaints from constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin joked that the Senate might have closed its doors
because ``there was a great desire to maintain its dignity.'' Most
analysts agreed, however, that the result of the secrecy might be
just the opposite: fewer inhibitions, especially by the president's
detractors, about making high-octane arguments for his removal from
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The easy suspicion is that they don't want to debate something
where a majority of the public feels one way and they feel
another,'' said Lawrence Walsh, special prosecutor in the
Iran-contra investigation. A closed session ``shouldn't happen
except when dealing with classified information or for national
security purposes.''

POPE JOHN PAUL TELLS MEXICANS THAT FAITH MUST OVERCOME CORRUPTION

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ John Paul II bade farewell to Mexico on Monday
with a spiritual message aimed straight at the country's social and
political ills.
</P>
<P>
   Faith, he said, must help society, especially the peasants and
indigenous peoples, overcome ``the corruption that permeates many
institutions and many citizens.'' He called on the country to
``root out drug trafficking, based on the lack of values, on the
lure of easy gain, and on youthful inexperience, to put an end to
the violence that divides brothers and social classes.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope addressed a fervent crowd at the Aztec Stadium here in
the last public event of his trip to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   He flies to the United States on Tuesday for an overnight visit
to St. Louis, where he will meet President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In the stadium, 120,000 people stomped, swayed and did the wave
when the Popemobile entered. Hundreds of doves were released into
the open sky shortly before the pope was elevated by lift onto a
rotating red podium. Outside, 100,000 more people lined sidewalks
and climbed trees for a last glimpse. As the pope sat on a white
chair, slowly turning, two giant television screens broadcast
satellite hook-ups with Catholics addressing from six Latin
countries and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, the pope sought to focus believers on the demands of
their faith in the coming millennium. But his remarks also carried
a strong political resonance in a country where corruption and
economic inequality is entrenched and the church is increasingly
outspoken about social and economic injustice.
</P>
<P>
   After 70 years of fierce anticlericalism, the Mexican government
finally recognized religious freedom in 1991 and restored
diplomatic relations with the Vatican the next year. This visit by
the pope united millions of Roman Catholics in a four-day frenzy of
joy and excitement. But it also heightened the tensions between the
Catholic church and the state.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps emboldened by the pope's presence, the leader of
Mexico's Catholic church, Cardinal Norberto Rivera Carrera,
delivered what many Mexicans view as his sharpest critique of the
country's leadership to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``People suffer and grow desperate because they see no imminent
solution to their cries for justice, food, health care, well
remunerated work,'' the cardinal told the pope at a Mass on Sunday
that was attended by more than a million people. ``Peace doesn't
seem close enough, and sometimes they feel like a puppet, no longer
manipulated by visible strings, but by remote control.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican newspapers carried the cardinal's remarks on their front
pages.
</P>
<P>
   The leftist newspaper La Jornada described them as ``an open
outburst by the Catholic hierarchy into earthly affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   During his stay, the pope did not refer to Chiapas, the state
where Indians and leftist guerrillas are in open rebellion against
the government.
</P>
<P>
   But his comments in support of the poor and the indigenous
populations were seized upon by the embattled bishop of Chiapas,
Samuel Ruiz, as vindication of his work with Indians and poor
people there. Conservatives have accused Ruiz, who acted as
mediator between local Indians and the government until last year,
of supporting the armed rebels.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Monday, Ruiz welcomed the pope's call
for strengthening the rights of Indian peoples and building closer
ties between Catholic churches of all social classes across the
hemisphere. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz has frequently clashed with the pope over his backing for
the political program of the armed Zapatista Indian rebels in
Chiapas. But on Monday, Ruiz cited his work in Chiapas as an
example of the support for the poorest Indian communities that the
pope has advocated. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This solidarity proclaimed by our brother the pontiff is
already happening,'' Ruiz said. Paraphrasing the pope, he added:
``The Indian is our poorest of the poor, one of the principal
actors and factors in building Christian unity.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, the pope asked the young to make a Christian
effort to improve society. ``You young people of Mexico and America
must act so that the world, which one day will be entrusted to you,
will be oriented towards God, and that political institutions, or
scientific, financial, or cultural ones, put themselves at the real
service of man, without distinctions based on race or social
class,'' he said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ After meandering through much of the day, stocks
closed higher on Monday, lifting major averages back into plus
territory for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft provided some early lift, opening more than 5 points
higher after the software giant, which last week reported strong
quarterly earnings, announced a 2-for-1 stock split. This is the
eighth time the company, which is based in Redmond, Wash., has
split its shares since it went public in March 1986. Its last split
was last Feb. 23, and as of Dec. 31, Microsoft had about 2.5

   Most other stocks, however, lagged behind until mid-afternoon
when selling seemed to dry up as investors digested the day's batch
of mostly positive earnings reports.

climbed 2,400, to 66,000, and the class B shares rose 55, to 2,130.

   Despite the gains, there was a strong undercurrent of caution as

 &HT;    Victim's last horrible moments recounted in dragging death trial
 &HT;    By Denise Gamino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ James Byrd Jr. spent the last horrifying moments
of his life desperately trying to save himself by using his elbows
as skids so his head wouldn't hit the pavement as he was dragged
behind a pickup, prosecutors revealed Monday in the case against
one of the accused killers.
</P>
<P>
   Several prospective jurors reacted in horror when Jasper County
District Attorney Guy James Gray began describing described Byrd's
helplessness behind a swerving truck that dragged him last summer
``just like a boat pulling a skier behind it.'' Gray said the
killers deliberately dumped his body near a black cemetery ``as
some sort of message.''
</P>
<P>
   Several men in the jury pool lifted their glasses to wipe their
eyes, and one then covered his face with his hand. One woman shook
her head in disgust while another gasped and looked heavenward.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I need to tell you,'' Gray said, ``is that
James Byrd, at the time he was chained to the back of the pickup
truck, was alive. Not only was he alive, he was conscious at that
time and he was using his elbows and his body in every manner he
could to keep his head and shoulders away from the pavement.''
</P>
<P>
   Jasper County officials estimate it will take two or three weeks
to select a jury for John William ``Bill'' King, the first of three
white men to stand trial for the death of Byrd, who was black. All
three could receive the death penalty for the crime that shook
America's soul and wounded this Deep East Texas town of 8,000.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors want at least three blacks on the jury but worry
they might end up with an all-white panel. The pool of 122
potential jurors is 17 percent black. Jasper County is about 20
percent black.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be difficult to get a black juror,'' Gray told
reporters. ``It worries me.''
</P>
<P>
   He said many blacks often don't want to serve on capital murder
juries because they traditionally have opposed the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them will base it on religion,'' he said. ``I think
more honestly, the black community has felt through the years
there's a disproportionate share of blacks that have received the
death penalty and they've kind of formed a community attitude about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Law officers call Byrd's death one of America's worst race-based
hate crimes. King and his co-defendants, Shawn Allen Berry and
Lawrence Russell Brewer, picked Byrd as a random black victim,
authorities allege.
</P>
<P>
   King, 24, was in the courtroom Monday, wearing black loafers,
baggy khaki pants and a long-sleeved blue-striped dress shirt that
covered the swirl of tattoos on his arms. One of King's tattoos
shows a black man hanging from a tree. His new, close-cropped
haircut revealed a pentagram-shaped tatoo on the back of his head.
</P>
<P>
   Underneath King's shirt, not visible to the prospective jurors,
was an electronic belt used in place of shackles for security.
Jasper County Sheriff Billy Rowles and a county jailer sat nearby
with remote-control devices that could zap King with 50,000 volts.
</P>
<P>
   King's father attended the opening day of jury selection, but
none of Byrd's family appeared. State District Judge Joe Bob Golden
has reserved seating for the Byrds in the first row of the
courtroom when the trial begins.
</P>
<P>
   King's court-appointed lawyers from Beaumont, C. Haden ``Sonny''
Cribbs Jr. and Brack Jones Jr. spoke to the potential jurors but
did not offer any clues about King's defense. Instead, Cribbs
argued against the humanity of the death penalty and said he would
be arguing to save the life of King, whom he referred to as ``this
young boy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you right up front I don't believe in the death
penalty,'' he said. ``I don't think it's a proper punishment for
any case, period. It's also your right not to believe in the death
penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Cribbs named the three drugs used for lethal
injections in the Texas prison system and described how each
assaulted the body.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly every mention of the death penalty, King looked down
at the defense table, sometimes swallowing hard and resting his
forehead on clasped hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Murder is a bad thing,'' Cribbs said. ``You take a human life.
We're going to talk about whether we're going to take a second one
or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, prosecutors and defense lawyers will begin to question
prospective jurors individually. Only seven possible jurors _ four
whites and three blacks _ have been instructed to appear today to
be interviewed about their personal background and attitudes toward
crime.
</P>
<P>
   As a whole, the prospective jurors dressed casually on Monday. A
dozen men sported gimme caps _ Nike, fertilizer and oil companies _
or black cowboy hats. One young man swigged a red soda from a
bottle at least once.
</P>
<P>
   Security is tight at the Jasper County courthouse for King's
trial. Metal detectors have been installed and a dog was used to
sniff for bombs.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, officers found a handgun in the purse of a
62-year-old woman who had been summoned as a prospective juror.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper Police Chief Stanley Christopher said the woman meant no
harm, but merely had forgotten the revolver was in her purse. She
was arrested, charged with unlawfully carrying a weapon and
released on $5,000 bail. She also was stricken from the jury list.

 &HT;    Struggling Dogs face No. 6 'Cats
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ What's wrong with Georgia?
</P>
<P>
   That's a question a lot of people are asking about the Bulldogs
as they get set to host No. 6 Kentucky tonight at Stegeman
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a team that features the SEC's top scorer in Jumaine
Jones and five seniors who have played in two NCAA Tournaments and
reached one NIT final. Yet the Bulldogs come into tonight's
nationally televised game against favored Kentucky (17-4) with a
12-7 record and a three-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we certainly need to play better defense,'' said Georgia
coach Ron Jirsa, whose team will put a 13-game home winning streak
on the line tonight. ``I thought we played defense well in three of
our first four (SEC) games but not as well in the last three or
four. We're giving up way too many 3-pointers, 14 to Arkansas, 10
to Ole Miss and I don't know how many to Tennessee (6). That's got
to improve.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs are 11th in the SEC in 3-point defense, with
opponents making 36 percent of their treys.
</P>
<P>
   A few other things plaguing Georgia are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Atrocious post play. Georgia's three centers _ Badi Oliver,
Robb Dryden and Eric DeYoung _ are averaging 6.2 points and 6.0
rebounds combined in SEC play.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ray Harrison's slump. The 6-foot-2 senior's production has
continued to plummet since his sophomore year. Harrison enters
tonight's game averaging 7 points and shooting 23 percent from the
field.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lack of identity. Jirsa has struggled to come up with a style
of play for his squad. The Bulldogs have tried to go small
sometimes (against Tennessee) and big others (Ole Miss). They try
to press and shoot 3-pointers one week, then try to slow it down
and run a half-court offense through Jones the next.
</P>
<P>
   _ The schedule. The Bulldogs have gotten no breaks. They played
five of their first seven SEC games on the road. Six of the last
nine are at home, but the first two are Kentucky and Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   Frustration appears to be creeping in. Twice during Saturday's
85-76 loss to Mississippi, Jones lashed out at teammates for not
getting him the ball when he felt he was open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not frustrated at all,'' Jones insisted afterward. ``I'm
just going to go out there and play as hard as I can every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones was asked whether he thought he should step up and assume
some of the leadership reponsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I leave that up to the seniors,'' Jones said. ``I figure
that's their job.''
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi forward Keith Carter expressed surprise at the ease
with which his team was able to dispatch the Bulldogs in Oxford
over the weekend. .
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a team that has so much talent. ... They have three or
four guys on their bench that could start at a lot of places,''
said Carter, Jones' teammate on the U.S. team during the Goodwill
Games last summer.

PEOPLE IN PHOENIX WANT IMPEACHMENT TRIAL TO END

   fee drinker drops his head, rubs his temple and flings his
newspaper down on the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe they want to keep going with this,'' says Bob
Moore, who was drinking a double espresso at the Biltmore's Coffee
Plantation. ``I want the impeachment trial against President
Clinton to end. I don't want it to continue another week. This has
gone on long enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the word is that House Republicans today will make a pitch
for witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard it all. They've heard it all. The world has heard
it all,'' complains Mary Reinfold, who is eating a muffin a few
tables over. ``They need to just make a decision. They need to
decide. Is that so hard for them to do? What more do they want to
hear? I think they're all a bunch of perverts.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustration with President Clinton's trial seems to be building
across the Phoenix area. One way or another, people here are saying
they want President Clinton's impeachment trial over.
</P>
<P>
   They don't want to hear Monica Lewinsky's tales of lust again.
They don't care about what else Betty Currie, the president's
secretary, or presidential friend Vernon Jordan may have to say.
They realize Americans will never agree on whether President
Clinton should stay or go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a calm person by nature,'' says Pamela Greene, who has
taken her two children to Kiwanis Park in Tempe for some fresh air.
``But this just gets me so mad. It's been going on a year. He lied
under oath. He obstructed justice. The facts are there. They should
have been rid of him a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Her children want to play on the swings, but Greene isn't
finished with her thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give Mommy five minutes, sweetheart,'' she tells her
3-year-old daughter, Susan. ``If we did something like that they
would have our you-know-whats in jail so fast. Why is he any
different? He should be held to higher standards. Our leaders are
stupid wimps.''
</P>
<P>
   The word ``stupid'' causes her children to take note. ``Mommy,
you said a bad word,'' Susan accuses her mom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a bad word when it's true,'' Greene responds. With
those words, she takes her daughter's hands and leads the girls to
the swings.
</P>
<P>
   At Borders Books &AMP; Music store in Mesa, a newspaper headline
about calling for witnesses sparks a lively discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to all that talk of a swift conclusion?'' an
incredulous Myra Faulkner asks people gathered by the magazine
stand. ``I thought they would be voting this week on resolving
matters. This sounds like they want to draw it out even more. What
are they thinking about?''
</P>
<P>
   A man looking at computer magazines shrugs and says, ``I knew it
was too good to be true.''
</P>
<P>
   Others add their opinions, and soon everyone is debating whether
President Clinton should stay in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we'll be surprised this week and this nightmare will
come to an end,'' says an optimistic Ron Moreno.
</P>
<P>
   Is that possible? The Senate is expected to vote today on the
Democratic attempt to dismiss charges against Clinton. But then
again, they'll also be determining whether to put witnesses on the
stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it'll be a miracle if this thing ends before summer,''
says Natalie Knap. ``If we can't reach an agreement here, what
makes us think the bozos in Washington can?'' &QL; 
As President Clinton's impeachment trial progresses, Julie Amparano
will be taking the pulse of people in the Phoenix area. Do they
care about President Clinton's trial? Do they want him removed from
office? What does captivate Americans? She looks for the answers.

FRANTIC NEGOTIATING LEADS TO NOWHERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the spirit of the day, Senator Phil Gramm of
Texas called Senator Edward M. Kennedy Monday morning with a
proposal to move the impeachment trial forward swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   And in the spirit of the day, Kennedy rejected it.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's proposal, which would have required Democrats to agree
to hear from two witnesses without a vote, was one of nearly a
half-dozen plans floated in conversations and ad hoc news
conferences, in hallways and behind closed doors, as senators of
both parties grappled with how to proceed with the impeachment
trial of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the plans fell by the wayside by mid-afternoon, as a
state of paralysis set in, and as both sides refused to make any
concessions. By Monday night, senators were proceeding according to
their prearranged plan, meeting in a closed session to debate a
motion to dismiss the case _ after the failure of another proposal,
by Senator Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat, to open the meeting to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   But during a frenzied day of moves and countermoves, senators
entertained at least four separate plans _ and rejected or planned
to reject every one, including the one floated by Gramm; another by
the Senate minority leader, Thomas A. Daschle; and yet a third by
Senator Russ Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat. And although the
strategizing and scheming seems likely to begin again Tuesday,
Monday's negotiations, according to Senator Frank Lautenberg,
amounted to a ``flurry of inactivity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're speeding, but I don't know whether we're speeding to
nowhere,'' said Lautenberg, a New Jersey Democrat. ``The pace is
fast, but it looks like going in circles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear all these rumors of plans,'' agreed Senator Bob
Smith, a New Hampshire Republican, ``but until everybody meets and
talks I don't think there are any plans.''
</P>
<P>
   The day began with Gramm's phone call to Kennedy. In a 15-minute
discussion, Gramm, a Texas Republican, made an offer to speed up
the trial and provide a ``date certain'' for ending it. In return,
Democrats would have had to agree to hear from two witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy floated the idea past Daschle during the morning
Democratic caucus, and both senators agreed: no backing down.
Around noon, Kennedy called Gramm back to reject the offer, and the
deal was ``effectively a non-starter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was dead in the water,'' Kennedy said late Monday.
``They're grasping at straws.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Kennedy and Gramm were negotiating _ rekindling an
alliance forged earlier this month that formed the basis for the
only bipartisan impeachment plan the Senate has agreed upon so far
_ others were floating their own ideas in public announcements and
private meetings.
</P>
<P>
   And some, at first, seemed plausible. After leaving the
Democratic caucus Monday, Daschle held a news conference to
announce a proposal he had already discussed with the Senate
majority leader, Trent Lott. The plan, crafted by Senator Joseph I.
Lieberman, a Democrat of Connecticut, and Slade Gorton, a
Republican of Washington, would have given the House prosecutors a
chance to rebut arguments made by the White House, Daschle said.
They would have spent Tuesday delivering closing arguments, leading
up to a debate over the two articles of impeachment Wednesday and
Thursday. A final vote on the articles would have been scheduled
for Friday, ending the entire trial.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not to be. Minutes after Daschle described it as
``just an idea,'' the proposal was shot down by Lott, who emerged
from the Republican caucus convinced it had little support.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Spencer Abraham, a Republican from Michigan, also said
the plan to move quickly to a final vote ``didn't have any takers
as far as I could see'' from within the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, Feingold put forward another plan, introducing a
motion on the Senate floor to allow two separate votes on the
motion to dismiss the case. The plan would have allowed senators to
consider each charge separately, conceivably allowing senators to
narrow their focus on each article of impeachment. Feingold, a
Democrat, had first proposed the plan in letter written jointly
with Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican who has said she
believes the charge of obstruction of justice deserves more
scrutiny than the charge of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   That proposal, however, died a swift death as well. Minutes
after Feingold floated the motion, there was a detractor in the
chamber, who blocked the unanimous consent among Senators it would
have required under the rules.
</P>
<P>
   But one plan, devised by Collins, did remain under serious
consideration Monday night. It also would divide the charges into
two parts: During the final vote, senators would be allowed to find
Clinton guilty of the charges, but would then face a second vote on
whether to remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   The split vote _ called informally the ``Son of Isenbergh''
scenario _ after the University of Chicago law professor who
informed Collins of the obscure constitutional option _ enjoyed a
relative groundswell of support among Republicans, according to
John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Lott.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an idea that is not meeting a great deal of opposition in
the Republican caucus,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Collins' proposal may have emerged unscathed Monday
night only because the high volume of other proposals flying
through the halls prevented potential opposition from coalescing.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how many proposals he had heard, Senator Christopher Dodd,
a Connecticut Democrat, replied: ``Dozens.''
</P>
<P>
   Felicia Knight, a spokeswoman for Collins, added: ``There are as
many ideas as there are senators.''

SURGEONS PERFORM FIRST HAND TRANSPLANT EVER IN UNITED STATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky., N.J., Australia, France)  (The Science Times) 
(fe) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Surgeons in Louisville, Ky., performed the first hand transplant
in the United States on Sunday, replacing the left hand of a New
Jersey man with one taken from an unidentified donor who had died a
few hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-hour operation was performed at Louisville Jewish
Hospital on Matthew David Scott, 37 years old, of Absecon, N.J.,
who lost his hand in a fireworks accident in December 1985,
hospital officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott's hand transplant is the third ever performed and the
second within five months. Clint Hallam, 48, of Australia is
progressing well after receiving a hand and forearm transplant in
Lyon, France, last September. Hallam is able to grasp a glass in
his hand and drink from it, two of his doctors said in recent
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Scott's hand was reattached about two inches above the wrist by
a team headed by Dr. Warren C. Breidenbach, a hand surgeon with
Kleinert, Kutz and Associates Hand Care Center and assistant
clinical professor of surgery at the University of Louisville. He
rushed back from a meeting on immunology in Colorado when a donor
hand suddenly became available.
</P>
<P>
   The family of the donor has asked that no information be given
about the individual's identity, said Elizabeth Reed, the regional
director for Kentucky Organ Donor Affiliates. ``It was a very
caring family who wanted to help,'' Ms. Reed said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, Scott, who trains and supervises a team of 200
paramedics for Virtua Health of Gibbsboro, N.J., was reported
sleepy but in stable condition after awakening from general
anesthesia. Scott is taking a combination of immunosuppressant
drugs in standard use in heart, liver and kidney transplants to
preserve the hand transplant. So far his body has shown no signs of
rejecting the hand.
</P>
<P>
   But ``there can be a lot of pitfalls along the way,''
Breidenbach said.
</P>
<P>
   A hospital spokesman described Scott, who is left-handed, as
smiling and having given a thumbs-up signal with his right hand
that he was not experiencing pain and happy the operation was over.
His wife, Dawn, a nurse, was at his bedside.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was conversing and over all looked very good,'' said Dr.
Jon W. Jones, one of the 17 surgeons, anesthesiologists and nurses
involved in the operation.
</P>
<P>
   It will be some time before the Louisville doctors can say the
transplant is a success. Jones, a transplant surgeon, said in an
interview that his team's animal experiments had shown that
rejection reactions rarely occur before 7 days and that 90 percent
of the reactions occurred in the first three months.
</P>
<P>
   If the grafted hand takes, weeks must pass before doctors can
determine how well it functions, and Scott must undergo more than a
year of physical and other therapy to gain full use of it, if that
is possible.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, ethicists and others do not share a unanimous view of
the safety and merits of transplanting a hand or limb because a
hand is not essential for life, and a recipient faces a lifetime of
taking powerful and dangerous drugs. Even if the transplant is
successful, the recipient could develop infections, cancer and
other serious illnesses that result in a shortened life.
</P>
<P>
   Approval for the Louisville operation was granted last June by
two committees at the University of Louisville and Jewish Hospital
that must sanction all experiments before they are carried out on a
human. Earlier, a leading medical ethicist, Dr. Mark Siegler of the
University of Chicago had deemed the hand transplant a justifiable
experiment.
</P>
<P>
   A number of other experts have criticized the procedure as too
risky.
</P>
<P>
   The first hand transplant was carried out in Ecuador in 1964. It
failed after two weeks when the recipient's body rejected the donor
hand. At the time only crude anti-rejection therapy was available.
</P>
<P>
   But the substantial improvement in immunosuppressive drug
therapy that has occurred since then led a team of Australian,
British, French and Italian doctors to give Hallam a new hand last
September.
</P>
<P>
   The Louisville team had been planning a hand transplant for
about three years and had discussed the technical, ethical and
other issues at a number of scientific meetings and in journals.
</P>
<P>
   ``My views have changed slowly as we've progressed through''
animal research and the ethics and science of hand transplantation,
Breidenbach said in an interview.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the team used the Internet (www.handtransplant.com)
to publicize its intent to perform a hand transplant, in order to
alert possible recipients and would-be donors. Scott read about
their work in an article in The Times of London while on vacation
in Britain and contacted Breidenbach in July.
</P>
<P>
   Scott was chosen for the experiment, Briedenbach said, because
he disliked his artificial hand, enjoyed strong family support and
was intelligent and articulate.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lousville team was upstaged by the international team
that performed the hand transplant in France. That team had not
signaled its intent to perform one, even at international
scientific meetings to discuss hand transplants.
</P>
<P>
   Hallam had also applied to the Louisville team for a hand
transplant. He had originally been described as ``a businessman
living in Perth, Western Australia,'' who had lost his hand in an
industrial accident. But it later turned out that he had a criminal
record and had lost his hand in an accident in jail in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Hallam's transplant, the American Society for
Surgery of the Hand joined critics of the procedure, saying that
the risk-to-benefit ratio for experimental hand transplants ``has
yet to be convincingly established.'' The society urged that
doctors not try another hand transplant until the success of
Hallam's operation could be determined and further experimental
work could be performed on animals.
</P>
<P>
   The Louisville team waited until mid-December to formally list a
patient for a hand transplant with the regional tissue procurement
agency, Breidenbach said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dr. Nadey Hakim of St. Mary's Hospital in London, one
of the team of physicians who worked on Hallam, said he was ``quite
surprised'' at Hallam's progress when he last examined him two
weeks ago. Hallam, who takes more than 30 pills a day, has not
experienced a rejection reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Hallam's ability to move muscles in the hand and the fingers
reflects nerve inputs at a level of his arm higher than where the
new hand was joined to his amputated arm. ``But the fact that he's
able to move them means that the muscles and tendons are obviously
of good quality and have not rejected and are obviously having a
very good blood supply,'' Hakim said.
</P>
<P>
   Hakim and Dr. Earl Owen, a microsurgeon in Sydney Australia who
led Hallam's transplant operation, both said in separate interviews
that he had gained 22 centimeters of nerve regeneration from the
level of the attachment to the beginning of the palm.
</P>
<P>
   And though Hallam's fingers are numb and sensation has not been
fully recovered, Hakim said, ``he's gotten a very strong grip.'' To
illustrate the point, Hakim recalled that on a visit to London, he
and Hallam visited a pub, and the patient ``picked up a pint of
beer and took a few sips and drank it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hakim said his team is considering doing a hand transplant in
London within the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Scott's accident occurred as he held an M-80 firecracker with a
fuse that burned faster than he expected. It exploded before he
could run out of a neighbor's house to throw it. The use or
possession of fireworks is illegal in New Jersey without a license.
</P>
<P>
   As for Scott's long-term prospects, Breidenbach said that he had
told all candidates for a hand transplant that there was ``a 50
percent probability that it will survive a year, and after that we
just really don't know.''

 &HT;    POPE MEETS WITH MEXICAN ELITE, APPEALS TO YOUTH TO REJUVENATE
CATHOLICISM

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ After preaching against abuse of the poor this
past weekend during public ceremonies, Pope John Paul II celebrated
a private mass here Monday morning with a select group of wealthy
and powerful Mexican businessmen and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday evening the pope returned to the public arena -- and
more ordinary Mexicans -- with a farewell speech in the capital's
Aztec Stadium focusing on themes he is also expected to also
address after he arrives in St. Louis, Mo. on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   One of those themes is the pontiff's call to rejuvenate the
Catholic church for the next millennium by recruiting more young
people throughout the Americas, a region he calls ``the continent
of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You, young men and women who look to tomorrow with hearts full
of hope, are called to be craftsmen of history and the new
evangelization,'' the pope said, in a speech before 110,000 people
gathered at the Aztec Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``You, Mexican and American youth,'' the Catholic leader added,
``must ensure that the world that one day will be entrusted to you
is oriented towards God, and that the political or scientific,
financial or cultural institutions be authentically at the service
of man, without racial or social discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope cracked a smile when the crowd in the stadium did ``the
wave'' in tribute to him.
</P>
<P>
   Ad-libbing, he told the cheering throng that many years ago he
came to them ``a foreign pope.'' And ``now you tell me, 'You are
Mexican.'''
</P>
<P>
   The pope was treated to a show that at times seemed more like a
pop music extravaganza complete with a fireworks display, blazing
candles and cigarette lighters, soaring violins and live satellite
feeds from rallies in other countries in the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's visit to Mexico and St. Louis could be one of the
final journeys the fragile 78-year-old pontiff makes to this
hemisphere. The purpose of the trip was to close a bishops'
conference on the future of the church in the Americas that began
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Among other concerns, the church is deeply worried about the
rapid spread of secularism and Protestantism in Latin America, the
greatest concentration of Catholics in the world.
</P>
<P>
   People from all walks of life -- poor, middle-class and wealthy
-- are abandoning Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   The church has already begun campaigns to try to reverse this
trend by opening up more Catholic schools to expose children to the
faith at a young age and recruit more young men into the
priesthood.
</P>
<P>
   Pamphlets on how to resist recruitment by Evangelical sects are
commonplace in Latin American Catholic churches.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic church in Latin America views ``everyone from the
Moonies to the Mormons to the Methodists'' as a threat, said
Anthony Gill, a specialist in church-state relations in Latin
America at the University of Washington in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Vatican views Mexico, which is more than 89 percent
Catholic, as a cornerstone of faith in this hemisphere, neighboring
Guatemala is now an estimated 30 to 40 percent Evangelical,
according to Gill.
</P>
<P>
   While in Mexico, the pope released a document outlining the
church's goals and chief concerns for the hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the need to spread the faith through a ``new
evangelism,'' he said, the church must follow ``a preferential
option for the poor,'' which takes into account human rights,
discrimination and questionable economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   In speeches in Mexico City, the pope -- known for his staunch
anti-communism -- warned that ``neo-liberal'' free-market reforms
and ``globalization'' are widening the gap between rich and poor in
the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   But while the pope urged governments and Catholics to protect
the poor, he also advised American bishops not to turn their backs
on the elite.
</P>
<P>
   Gill said the church is as eager to keep Latin America's
powerful -- who set social policy -- among its ranks as they are to
attract youth and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The Mass the pope celebrated Monday morning with Mexican elites
included some 250 political figures, businessmen and donors to the
Catholic church. The Mass was held at Mexico City's papal nunciate,
a mini-estate that serves as the Vatican's embassy in an upscale
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Some Mexican commentators regarded the exclusive meeting with
rich businessmen and heads of political parties as contradictory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic that all of the businesses that have helped pay
for the pope's visit and all of the government people who have
surrounded him are the same people who are profiting greatly from
the same neo-liberal economic policies he's been criticizing,''
said Carlos Monsavais, a well-known Mexican writer.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Mexico's faithful were more understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the pope accepted that invitation (to a private mass) so
he can give those people a direct message that they need to change
some policies, and stop turning their backs on people in need,''
said Adriana Luna, 20, a journalism student who was at the Azteca
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they'll probably ignore what he told them later,'' Luna
conceded.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated crowd of more than one million people lined the
streets of Mexico City to watch the pope speed by in his pope
mobile Monday en route to events.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the young people the pope appealed to in Mexico said
they appreciated the pontiff's plea to help revive Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   Natali Benitez, 27, said, ``I admire the pope immensely. He has
a special presence wherever he goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Benitez said she broke with the pope over birth control,
however.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope comes from another generation and he sticks more to
the word of God,'' she said. ``But we live in a more realistic
world.''

discrimination and questionable economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   In speeches in Mexico City, the pope -- known for his staunch
anti-communism -- warned that ``neo-liberal'' free-market reforms
and ``globalization'' are widening the gap between rich and poor in
the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   But while the pope urged governments and Catholics to protect
the poor, he also advised American bishops not to turn their backs
on the elite.
</P>
<P>
   Gill said the church is as eager to keep Latin America's
powerful -- who set social policy -- among its ranks as they are to
attract youth and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The Mass the pope celebrated Monday morning with Mexican elites
included some 250 political figures, businessmen and donors to the
Catholic church. The Mass was held at Mexico City's papal nunciate,
a mini-estate that serves as the Vatican's embassy in an upscale
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Some Mexican commentators regarded the exclusive meeting with
rich businessmen and heads of political parties as contradictory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic that all of the businesses that have helped pay
for the pope's visit and all of the government people who have
surrounded him are the same people who are profiting greatly from
the same neo-liberal economic policies he's been criticizing,''
said Carlos Monsavais, a well-known Mexican writer.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Mexico's faithful were more understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the pope accepted that invitation (to a private mass) so
he can give those people a direct message that they need to change
some policies, and stop turning their backs on people in need,''
said Adriana Luna, 20, a journalism student who was at the Azteca
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they'll probably ignore what he told them later,'' Luna
conceded.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated crowd of more than one million people lined the
streets of Mexico City to watch the pope speed by in his pope
mobile Monday en route to events.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the young people the pope appealed to in Mexico said
they appreciated the pontiff's plea to help revive Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   Natali Benitez, 27, said, ``I admire the pope immensely. He has
a special presence wherever he goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Benitez said she broke with the pope over birth control,
however.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope comes from another generation and he sticks more to
the word of God,'' she said. ``But we live in a more realistic
world.''

 &HT;    Broncos notebook

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ She isn't on the Denver Broncos payroll, but Dr. Judy
Lane, a neuroloist and the medical director of the Head Pain Center
in Englewood, Colo., certainly rates as one of the team's most
important groupies.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, Lane has been on the cutting edge of research
into headaches, and in the last two seasons she has helped tailback
Terrell Davis deal with a malady that remains mysterious and
unpredictable. Ever since his days in Pop Warner Football, Davis
has suffered from what the medical profession terms ``migraine with
aura.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His memories of that first headache,'' Lane said, ``were quite
vivid. That didn't surprise me because they always are. It's like a
monster that has crawled inside your body.''
</P>
<P>
   An avid fan, Lane first learned of Davis' problems when Broncos
team physician Arthur Ziporin phoned her in 1996 to enlist her aid.
She has recommended medication for Davis and, for the most part,
the treatment has been successful.
</P>
<P>
   Before Super Bowl XXXII last January, however, Davis forgot to
take the medication and Lane described the consequence as
``probably the most famous headache in history.'' Davis missed the
entire second quarter and a brief part of the third period. He
still rushed for 157 yards and three touchdowns and earned MVP
honors. ``Just think about what he would have had if he'd played
that (second) quarter,'' Broncos guard Mark Schlereth said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis already has hung a sign in his locker reminding him to
take the medication on Sunday. Backup tailback Derek Loville also
intends to make sure Davis has followed all of Lane's advice. Said
Lane: ``I'll kill him if he screws up this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway impressed
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback John Elway noted that one of the biggest problems
the Broncos face on Sunday is the overall team speed of the Atlanta
defensive unit. ''The guys upfront do a great job of pressuing and
getting upfield,'' he said. ''You don't keep that bunch out of many
plays. You watch the tape and there are always three or four of
them around the ball.'' Because they played in the same division
during Eugene Robinson's 11 seasons in Seattle, Elway has faced the
Atlanta free safety 25 times in his 16-year career. In Super Bowl
XXXII last year, with Robinson playing for Green Bay, he had an
interception off Elway. ''He's not only a great athlete, but he's
very smart,'' Elway said of Robinson. ''You have to be real careful
with him. You know he's not going to be out of position and he's
going to make a lot of plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Practice report
</P>
<P>
   Denver practiced for 85 minutes in pads on Monday at the Miami
Dolphins facility in Davie, Fla. The Broncos worked on special
teams for the first 30 minutes, then reviwed the offensive and
defensive game plans. The team worked 25 plays on both sides of the
ball. The practice was briefly interrupted when a helicoptor from a
local television flew over the field. ''We almost shot it down,''
coach Mike Shanahan said. The Broncos followed their usual
tradition of calling on a member of the organization to lead them
in stretching. Tight end Shannon Sharpe, who serves as the emcee,
summoned assistant strength and conditioning coach Greg Saporta and
trainer Steve Antonopulos. Sharpe adds nicknames for his victims
and he dubbed Saporta ''Crime Dog'' and Antonopulos ''Greek.''
Shanahan implemented a 1:30 a.m. curfew for Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   A flat third wheel
</P>
<P>
   Much like the Atlanta offense, the Broncos have gotten little
production this season from the third wide receiver spot behind
starters Ed McCaffrey and Rod Smith. During the regular season,
Shanahan and offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak used a variety of
''slot'' receivers. Athens, Ga. native and former Clarke Central
High School star Willie Green was most effective, with 16 catches
for 194 yards and one touchdown. Top draft choice Marcus Nash, who
held down the ''slot'' position for two games, had four catches for
76 yards. Because they lack a quality third wideout, the Broncos
frequently use a second tight end, usually Byron Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   Long, lean Green
</P>
<P>
   Green is definitely going in style this week. The eight-year
veteran rented a midnight blue 1999 Lamborghini convertable ($1,900
per day) for the Super Bowl festivities and is tooling around the
South Beach area in it. ''This is the true Willie Green we're
seeing here now,'' said Denver fullback Howard Griffith.
</P>
<P>
   Stat of the day
</P>
<P>
   If the Broncos win Sunday, they will establish a new NFL record
for most victories in a three-year period. Dating back to 1996, the
Broncos have 45 victories, tying them with the 1988-90 San
Francisco 49ers coached by Bill Walsh and George Seifert. The
Dallas Cowboys of 1992-94 had 44 victories.
</P>
<P>
   Head goes here
</P>
<P>
   It is another indication that the Super Bowl has gotten a little
too big for its hip pads when broadcast news outlets start issuing
press releases when they think they have a scoop. Fox Sports
Network did it Monday. And it was bogus.
</P>
<P>
   Trumpeting an interview with Denver's John Elway, Fox
distributed a hand-out claiming the Bronco quarterback was
reconsidering retirement after the season, particularly if his team
wins. Elway was quoted as saying, ''There'd be nothing better than
to get two in a row and have to contemplate coming back for a
third, because no one's ever done it three times in a row. So
definitely, if we could get a win here, it would throw a little
wrench into my thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   The only detractors to the report are, Elway would turn 38 next
season. Unlike last year when there was a large public hue and cry
that he return, there is none this winter. And the Broncos
organization is almost unanymous in the opinion that the future
Hall of Famer is intent on hanging it up after Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Elway's reported reconsideration, coach Mike
Shanahan was dubious.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm hoping he would (come back),'' Shanahan said. ''But my gut
feeling, as I've shared with you before, is that it'll be his last
game. If you talk to him, kind of help me along a little bit. I'd
appreciate it.''
</P>
<P>
   A time to rest
</P>
<P>
   In the mdist of Super Bowl week, the Broncos are taking a day
off Tuesday. Aside from the morning media session and some photo
appointments, the team will have no functions and Shanahan called
for a 1:30 a.m. curfew, the latest of the week, to put the team
back on its regular work schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos have adopted the same Super Bowl schedule that the
San Francisco 49ers have traditionally used and Shanahan
appropriated it after seeing how sucessful it was duing his three
seasons as a 49ers assistant (1992-94).
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just like a regular day during the regular season,'' the
coach said. ''We tell the players to take care of themselves. They
represent the Denver Broncos. We want them to enjoy their time
off.''
</P>
<P>
   The last word(s)
</P>
<P>
   The ever-loquacious Sharpe, on whether Shanahan has attempted to
muzzle him this week: ''Their guy (cornerback Ray Buchanan) already
fired the first shot, so nothing I say is going to top that. I
could be outrageous, not that I'm going to be, and I'd still only
be No. 2 behind their guy now.''

 &HT;    Broncos sticking with plan
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FT. LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ Last year, the Denver Broncos went into
Super Bowl XXXII against the Green Bay Packers as significant
underdogs. Of course, they defied the oddsmakers and won their
first NFL championship. The script is flipped this time, but the
favored Broncos profess to maintain the same posture against the
upstart Falcons that wrought them championship rings against the
repeat-seeking Packers.
</P>
<P>
   It's about learning from experience. Denver listened to all the
talk in San Diego about the Packers' superior experience and talent
_ and then went out and won it. Having been there, the Broncos are
not about to fall into the same trap that caught Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago,'' coach Mike Shanahan said, ``everyone talked
about Green Bay. Our team understands that if we don't play our
best, we won't win the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been there. There's no way our team will be
overconfident. Anything we get, we'll have to earn. And if you
don't have that attitude, you'll get embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is what happened to Green Bay. When the talk all week was
of a Packers repeat, the Broncos nodded their heads knowingly. They
had a quiet confidence that was well-placed, based on the way they
performed in the 31-24 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody talked about the Packers last year,'' receiver Rod
Smith said, ``but we knew what type of team we had. We knew what we
were capable of. Now, it's the same situation for Atlanta. I'm sure
they know how good they are, too. And so do we. We know we have to
make plays to win.''
</P>
<P>
   And the experienced Broncos also know that a cap has to be put
on the amount of fun had in the days leading up to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to have fun,'' fullback Howard Griffith said. ``But
you have to understand what fun is. You have to also focus on the
reason we're here. It's only one game. It behooves you to get your
rest and study the game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver's plan in the two weeks before the game is the same as
last year. That is, the Broncos _ unlike the Falcons _ put in their
game plan last week. Hey, it worked against Green Bay. Why deviate?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very comfortable with the play of last year,'' Shanahan
said. ``It's the same plan, almost to a T.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Griffith: ``That's a big help to us. We get to go through
the game plan twice. It's like if you were in school and you had
two weeks for a test. If you go over it twice, it's better to know
the answers that are going to be on the test. That's how we feel
about having the game plan for two weeks.''

BABY BELLS WIN HIGH COURT DECISION ON COMPETITION
</HEADLINE>
   (See also SCOTUS-CENSUS, SCOTUS-FUNDRAISING, SCOTUS-HUGHES) 
(sw) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Supreme Court on Monday issued a ruling that could delay
efforts to open the $100 billion local telephone business to
competition.
</P>
<P>
   The court overturned a Federal Communications Commission rule
that had forced the Baby Bells and other local phone giants to sell
access to almost all parts of their networks, such as copper wires
and switching computers, to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's decision could make it harder for new local phone
companies to link to incumbents' systems, especially those that
deliver advanced services like high-speed Internet access. That
could put off the day when more than a handful of U.S. consumers
have a choice of local phone company.
</P>
<P>
   The court also, however, handed the FCC a big victory by ruling
that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 gives the commission, not
the states, general authority to set rules meant to enhance
competition. The court also upheld a handful of the commission's
other regulations aimed at stimulating competition.
</P>
<P>
   The rulings wrapped up a three-year legal battle between the
Bell companies, the long-distance titans, the FCC and the states
over the jurisdiction and substance of local-telephone regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up today with a bad case of the flu and was lying in
bed and the news of the decision was an elixir,'' William E.
Kennard, the commission's chairman said. ``It had a healing effect
on my whole body.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This should accelerate the pace of local competition because
it will bring certainty to the implementation of the act,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   But in requiring the local phone incumbents to sell access to
almost every part of their networks, the commission went too fast,
the court ruled. Network parts consist of hundreds of components,
ranging from electronic boxes on the sides of homes to call-waiting
software.
</P>
<P>
   The commission violated the act by failing to consider whether
forcing the local incumbents to provide access to each network part
was ``necessary'' to promote competition and whether new entrants
would be ``impaired'' by having to get the network part on their
own, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission must now develop a new set of rules to determine
which parts of their networks the local phone giants must resell to
competitors, using the ``necessary and impair'' standard. That
process could take months. And after the new rules are made, it is
unlikely that the list of network parts the local phone incumbents
are required to provide will be as long as it was before.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel P. Reingold, head telecommunications analyst at Merrill
Lynch, said the ruling could force new local companies to invest
more on their own because they cannot rent access to the
incumbents' systems.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Salsbury, MCI Worldcom Inc.'s general counsel, and Mark
C. Rosenblum, AT&AMP;T Corp.'s vice president for law and public
policy, each ventured that the commission could legitimately keep
all of the same network parts on the list.
</P>
<P>
   But Kennard seemed to imply that was unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to go back to the drawing board,'' he said. ``There
may be some skirmishes around the edges, but when the dust settles
we know that the competitors will get access to that core of
services which are necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   People close to the commission said it could become especially
difficult to require the local incumbents to sell access to new
technologies because it would be hard to define them as necessary
to a new entrant. A person close to the commission said that an
order on how the local phone giants must sell access to their
high-speed Internet systems, which was set to be released as soon
as Thursday, would have to be redrafted in light of Monday's
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the must-win defensive issue, the Bells won convincingly,''
said Scott Cleland, an analyst for the Legg Mason Precursor Group.
``They essentially completely prevented a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   One senior Bell company executive said on Monday that his
company would use wrangling over the ``necessary and impair''
standard to advance his company's long-distance aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   Another complication is that the local incumbents could
potentially challenge many of the hundreds of deals they have made
to connect their networks to those of their competitors, many of
which were based on the assumption that the incumbents had to sell
access to all of their systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all potentially subject to challenge,'' said William
P. Barr, chief counsel for the GTE Corp.
</P>
<P>
   One question is whether either new entrants or incumbents will
be willing to negotiate during a time of regulatory uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to come up with some interim guidance to the
industry and we're going to be digging into that in the next
several days,'' Kennard said. ``We hope that people will take a
deep breath and wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the court's upholding of some of the F.C.C.'s other
regulations for local phone competition _ such as a rule forbidding
incumbents from breaking up network parts they generally provide in
a package _ will advance the commission's plans. And the ruling
giving the FCC, not the states, general authority to make the rules
for local telephone competition will surely resonate in Washington.
Since the act's passage, the commission has come in for blistering
criticism from some members of Congress for its aggressive approach
to regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel totally vindicated,'' said Reed E. Hundt, Kennard's
predecessor, who was vilified by many politicians and local phone
executives before and after retiring in 1997. ``For three years I
and then Chairman Kennard were told that we were running a rogue
agency and that we needed to learn how to read. And it turned out
we were right.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``This means that Bill Kennard is the man and that I'm
going to Disneyland.''

VIOLENCE CLAIMS MORE VICTIMS IN KOSOVO  
 (HLW)

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ American diplomats pressed ethnic
Albanian leaders Monday to unite behind a realistic negotiating
position for the future of Kosovo, even as another grisly killing
of Albanian civilians, including two children, emphasized the
urgency of their task.
</P>
<P>
   The American envoy, Christopher Hill, met with Ibrahim Rugova
and other ethnic Albanian leaders of this southern Serbian province
that has been ripped by an armed Albanian uprising and repression
from the Serbian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Hill presented the Albanian leadership with a set of principles
for Kosovo's future endorsed last Friday by the United States,
Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Russia, which form the
so-called Contact Group for the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Hill has waited months for the divided ethnic Albanians to unite
around a plan for Kosovo's future, which could then be taken up
with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. Hill's job has been
complicated by a cycle of attacks on Serbs by ethnic Albanian
guerrillas and disproportionate responses from Serbian forces, all
in violation of an October cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   But after the massacre last Friday of 45 Albanians by Serbian
forces in the village of Racak, the West has concluded that a
negotiated solution must be found quickly before the province is
again torn by open warfare.
</P>
<P>
   The urgency of the task _ and the difficulty of compromise _ was
underlined Monday by the discovery of the five dead Albanians,
riddled with bullets, by the side of the road near Rakovina, a
village some 35 miles southwest of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   The dead _ two men, a woman and two boys _ were found early
Monday morning by international monitors. The Albanians appeared to
have been shot at close range by heavy machine-gun fire as they
rode in a tractor trailer from a cornfield off the main road.
</P>
<P>
   A husband and his wife were found slumped in the cab of the
tractor. Half the man's head was blown away. Empty shell casings
littered the ground nearby. On the trailer, piled with hay and
grain, lay the bodies of a father and his two sons, about 10 and 12
years old.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center, quoting
unidentified local residents, said that Serbian police officers
fired at the victims from an armored vehicle. But the Serb Media
Center said the village was controlled by the ethnic Albanian
guerrillas known as the Kosovo Liberation Army and that the police
rarely patrolled there.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb center also reported that police were attacked 15 miles
west of Pristina and returned fire, injuring one person.
</P>
<P>
   The Contact Group, with NATO and the European Union, is pressing
for a rapid sequence of negotiations. The ethnic Albanians are
being pressured to accept effective self-rule for Kosovo, within
the Yugoslav Federation, until its final status can be determined
in three or more years. To that end, the Albanians will be invited
by the Contact Group to a meeting outside the province. NATO
officials say they are working on plans to restrict the flow of
arms to the Kosovo Liberation Army fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Mahmut Bakalli, the influential former communist leader of
Kosovo, said today that ``independence from Serbian jurisdiction
and republican status for Kosovo within Yugoslavia,'' as an equal
with Serbia or Montenegro, should be acceptable to the Albanian
side, even to the fighters, with a referendum on Kosovo's final
status later on.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, who currently rejects autonomy for Kosovo, even
within Serbia, and who has expanded his forces in Kosovo in
violation of the October agreement, will be invited to negotiate
with the Albanians, just as he took part in the talks that ended
the Bosnian war. NATO is threatening to bomb Serbia if Milosevic
does not comply with the October agreement or accept a new
political status for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's legal justification will be the same as it was in
October, the last time bombing was threatened: to prevent a
catastrophe in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is sure to have doubts that all 16 NATO countries
would be willing to bomb a sovereign European state. But with
strong sanctions already in place against Yugoslavia, there are a
few other levers with which to pressure him.
</P>
<P>
   The outlines of that plan were endorsed Monday by European Union
foreign ministers, meeting in Brussels. They urged the Albanians to
``form a broad-based and truly representative team'' to take part
in internationally brokered talks with Belgrade. ``The Kosovo
Albanian leadership's failure to unite risks serious harm to the
people of Kosovo,'' they said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Cook, the British foreign secretary, said the two sides
had to compromise to avoid further bloodshed. The Contact Group's
principles ``would give real self-government to Kosovo and would
give Serbia an opportunity to get out of a conflict that is
increasingly isolating it from the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A political settlement in Kosovo could be guaranteed by
peacekeeping troops, either arranged through NATO or the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
currently has some 800 unarmed monitors in the province.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign ministers of the Contact Group, which oversees the
former Yugoslavia, are expected to meet at the end of the week.

MIDSEASON ANALYSIS: STABILITY GIVES DUCKS HOPE

   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ If nothing else, the Mighty Ducks are
creatures of habit. Once again they entered the NHL All-Star break
with a sub-.500 record.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike last year, there is reason for optimism. The Ducks,
who in their history are a total of 35 games under .500 before the
All-Star break, head into the stretch drive of the 1998-99 season
with a Western Conference playoff berth a legitimate goal, not
something hidden away in Fantasyland.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks are two games under .500 (17-19-9), but that is three
games better than '96-97 when the team made its only trip to the
playoffs. It's an improvement of eight games from last year when
they went on to finish 26-43-13.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks are tied for fifth in the Western Conference with 43
points, even though they had their share of ups and downs,
including a six-game unbeaten streak and a five-game winless
streak.
</P>
<P>
   Predicted by many to be one of the worst teams in the league,
Anaheim has showed signs it might be capable of repeating the kind
of play that saw it post a combined 38-24-11 record after All-Star
breaks in '95-96 and '96-97.
</P>
<P>
   From the first day of training camp, stability has reigned, not
chaos.
</P>
<P>
   There were no holdouts. One man (Pierre Gauthier) has been in
charge of the hockey operations since former president Tony Tavares
stepped down and general manager Jack Ferreira was fired.
Meanwhile, new coach Craig Hartsburg simply demands hard work and
commitment, and hasn't confused the players by changing systems
every other week, as was the case with Pierre Page.
</P>
<P>
   The stability has also led to a more relaxed atmosphere in a
dressing room that appears to house a group of players who seem to
enjoy each other.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans Kevin Haller, Jim McKenzie and Stu Grimson _ acquired
by Ferreira _ have provided some much-needed leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Other keys so far have been:
</P>
<P>
   !arrow! &UR; !off! &LR; The dramatic improvement of the special teams.
Historically, the Ducks have been one of the NHL's worst when it
came to special-teams play. This year, both the power play (fifth)
and penalty killing (ninth) are in the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow! &UR; !off! &LR; The return to form of Paul Kariya and Guy Hebert.
Kariya, after playing only 22 games last season, is fully recovered
from his concussion and is leading the league in scoring with 62
points.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert wasn't named an All-Star, but he has played like one
(.928 save percentage, four shutouts) and he usually gets better in
the second half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow! &UR; !off! &LR; Last but certainly not least is the tremendous
improvement in team defense. Anaheim's group of no-name defensemen
(i.e. Jason Marshall, Haller, Jaime Pushor, Ruslan Salei) have
helped turn around a team that last year gave up 3.2 goals a game.
This season, the Ducks are allowing only 2.4 per game.
</P>
<P>
   But as Hartsburg often points out, the Ducks have a long, long
way to go before they reach their potential. There are areas that
obviously need to be improved on.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks can't rely on their power play and their top line all
the time. They have been outscored at even strength by eight goals
and desperately need a consistent second line to take some of the
pressure off Kariya, Teemu Selanne and Steve Rucchin. The
performances of Tomas Sandstrom, Marty McInnis, Travis Green and
Matt Cullen will be crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim has already won 12 games at the Pond, one more game than
it won at home all last season. The Ducks, however, must prove they
can survive on the road, where they are only 5-11-5.
</P>
<P>
   Quality playoff teams turn in a consistent effort night after
night, and no matter how much Hartsburg preaches, his words have
sometimes fallen upon deaf ears. The Ducks can't afford
embarrassing no-effort performances like the one that resulted in a
recent loss to Calgary at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of McInnis was crucial, but Gauthier needs to
find the Ducks one more veteran defenseman for the season's final
push. That player should be one who can pass the puck well and join
the attack on occasion to take the pressure off the forwards.
Fredrik Olausson has 10 goals already, but the other six defensemen
on the current roster have combined for only three.

CATHOLICS TRY TO RESEED ST. LOUIS WITH $5,000 OFFER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Kan.)  (Eds: See also POPE-MEXICO) 
(mk) 
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ It was a compelling offer for Dave and Patti
Patty-G'sell: $5,000 to put toward buying a house.
</P>
<P>
   And there were only a few strings attached. The house had to be
in a St. Louis neighborhood where crime and economic hard times had
taken their toll. They had to commit to being there five years or
pay the money back. And they had to join the neighborhood Roman
Catholic Church and send their children to the neighborhood
Catholic school.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual effort to lure Catholics back to the city, the
Archdiocese of St. Louis has begun making the offer to any
Catholics outside the city if they settle in one of three racially
diverse South Side neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless there is that outreach on our part, this parish is not
going to survive,'' said the Rev. Kenneth Brown, pastor of St.
Margaret of Scotland, one of the three St. Louis parishes that
started what priests call the ``Catholic homesteading'' program a
few months ago. So far, Brown, who has been recruiting in suburban
churches, has had two takers _ a Gary Sebescak, who is single, and
the Patty-G'sells, a young couple expecting their first child. In
another parish, Holy Family, a family has accepted the offer. The
third parish is Saint Pius V.
</P>
<P>
   When Pope John Paul II visits St. Louis on Tuesday and
Wednesday, he will see a city where officials have spent months
repaving streets and planting trees to spruce it up. New lights
will adorn the famous Gateway Arch and nuns are baking 131,000 tiny
hosts for a gigantic Mass at the Trans World Dome.
</P>
<P>
   So much care has been taken to make the pope's visit a success
that most people believe it could not have been coincidence that an
execution of a death-row inmate scheduled for during the visit was
postponed till February by the Missouri Supreme Court. The pope is
stridently opposed to the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 600,000 people will assemble to see the pontiff, a
number that organizers like to point out dwarfs the 50,000 fans who
flooded the streets when Mark McGwire smashed his record-breaking
home run.
</P>
<P>
   But underneath all the gloss and ceremony, there will be another
St. Louis, too. It is a city that has been hemorrhaging people,
including many Catholics, to the suburbs for years, a city beset
with many struggling neighborhoods, a city wrestling with the
thorny problems of racial strife and floundering public schools.
</P>
<P>
   On this, the pope's fifth visit to the United States, he will
sound broad themes about youth and the future of the church in
America. Here in St. Louis, priests say, the future of the church's
urban core is inextricably linked to the progress of the city and
its ability to handle some of these intractable issues.
</P>
<P>
   Several priests are hoping the pope, who has had a long
association with St. Louis' archbishop, Justin Rigali, will speak,
at least obliquely, about the situation in the city. Indeed, one
public gesture during the pope's visit will be the formation by the
archdiocese's ecumenical office and several non-Catholic clergy
groups of an interfaith effort to get local congregations involved
in rehabilitating housing, tutoring children and providing
immunizations in St. Louis' inner city.
</P>
<P>
   But many efforts are already under way. In a burst of civic
activism over the last several years, the Catholic Church in this
Catholic city has taken it upon itself to try to address some of
the struggles of the city's neighborhoods _ and at the same time
try to keep its parishes and schools from foundering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're getting beyond a problem,'' said Monsignor Ted
Wojcicki, the archdiocese's vicar for pastoral planning. ``You're
getting to a crisis in terms of the city. In the diocese, we commit
tremendous resources to maintaining a presence in the urban
areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1950, the city of St. Louis has lost more than half of its
population, about 400,000 people, largely to the suburbs. The
archdiocese's suburban parishes have boomed, but the church in this
city that was founded by French Catholics has seen its urban ranks
dwindle to 70,000 from about 200,000 in that time, and 33 of its 85
city parishes have closed for lack of people, Wojcicki said.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Homesteading program, in which the archdiocese is
investing $375,000 over five years, is only one example of church
efforts to revitalize city neighborhoods. Catholic churches have
formed organizations, in some cases with the help of non-Catholic
churches, to get low-interest loans to help low-income and
working-class families buy homes in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic churches have been lobbying city officials to crack
down on absentee landlords and recently convinced the city to
double the fine for building-code violations.
</P>
<P>
   And just last week, Rigali took the unusual step of endorsing,
in writing, a proposed sales tax increase of two-thirds of a penny
that city residents will vote on next month. The increase would pay
for the continuation of the country's largest busing program, which
sends some 13,000 black inner-city students to mostly white
suburban schools. Many public school parents and some school
administrators favor busing, saying it gives black students a
choice of where to be educated and gives city schools an incentive
to compete for students.
</P>
<P>
   At a neighborhood level, churches are pressuring owners of
abandoned buildings. St. Pius V, on the South Side, convinced the
owner of an abandoned Sears building to sell to a developer who
would build 30 homes on the property, hoping to encourage some of
the neighborhood's Vietnamese and Bosnian immigrants to become
homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Brown at St. Margaret of Scotland is on the board of a new
organization that plans to buy rundown properties in his Shaw
neighborhood and rehabilitate them or tear them down for new homes.
And, in an effort to reach out to his neighborhood's large and
relatively poor non-Catholic African American community, Brown has
formed a choir that includes the children of these families and
plans to hire a black woman as a church outreach worker in the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Clarence Harmon says he welcomes the church's activism,
calling the parishes and their schools ``the glue that keeps it all
from unraveling.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the church's lobbying efforts have put him in a
difficult position, said Harmon, who is an African American
Catholic. For example, he said, some alderman have worried that
cracking down on substandard buildings could leave poor families
living in those buildings without affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, on balance, he is supportive. ``I think it's a new kind
of evangelism, if you will,'' Harmon said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that when he heard about the Catholic Homesteading
program, ``I shouted words of glee.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Patty-G'sells, who moved from University City, just
west of St. Louis, to be close to Ms. Patty-G'sell's job as a
school counselor, are happy with their decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I wouldn't even consider moving down here,'' said
Patty-G'sell, who said they paid $94,000 for a four-bedroom brick
house. ``But I'm learning that it's actually not so bad after all.
We had a better welcome here than I think I've had any place I've
ever lived.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, whose church has 450 families, down from 2,200 in the
1950s, is busy trolling for more buyers like the Patty-G'sells.
This Sunday, he will take his pitch to St. Charles County, a
largely white suburban area that now has more Catholics than the
city itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll say, `Let's face it, 99 percent of you people obviously
aren't going to be moving to St. Margaret of Scotland,''' Brown
said. ```We're not kidding anybody. This is not for the faint of
heart. But you have children and you have grandchildren.' They go
home and they say, `You wouldn't believe the fool that came to
speak to us,' but their kids might say, `Hmmm, that's sounds
okay.'''

CLOSING SENATE IMPEACHMENT SESSION SPARKS CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``The sergeant at arms will please close the
doors.''
</P>
<P>
   With that pronouncement, Chief Justice William Rehnquist ordered
the Senate into a rare closed session during the impeachment trial
Monday, sending Democrats into an uproar over denying the public
its ``right to know.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote upholding the private session ``is one, I think, that
will live in infamy,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. `` The
American people need and have the right to know how and why we
reach the decisions we do.'' Harkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Rehnquist's order, the doors to the press and
visitors' galleries above the chamber swung shut.
</P>
<P>
   CSPAN2, accustomed to showing all Senate proceedings, stopped
broadcasting from the chamber. Instead, it began taking viewer
phone calls in its studios.
</P>
<P>
   Senators shut off their microphones, and addressed one another
from the ``well'' at the front of the chamber, said Sen. Jon Kyl,
R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to be very quiet to hear,'' Kyl said.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, senators faced a debate within a debate. The members,
already burdened with deciding whether to dismiss impeachment
articles against Clinton, now had to defend themselves against
allegations that they were shutting the public out of the people's
business.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans argued that the quality of deliberations would rise
if the discussions were held with only the senators present.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that keeping our deliberations closed will
discourage partisan posturing and promote open, honest and fair
debate as the Senate discharges this most solemn responsibility,''
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   An attempt by Harkin and Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., to keep
the debate open was rejected by a vote of 57-43. It would have
needed a two-thirds majority to pass.
</P>
<P>
   The Harkin-Wellstone proposal drew the support of 40 Democrats
and three Republicans. Opposed were 52 Republicans and five
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Both McCain and Kyl voted to keep the deliberations private.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to end this trial expeditiously, you can't have
three days of argument on every motion, and that's what you'd get
in public deliberations,'' Kyl said. ``Everybody would feel an
obligation to say something.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyl said the lawyers on both sides of the impeachment case had
already made comprehensive arguments, and there was no need to hear
senators posturing.
</P>
<P>
   McCain suggested it was no accident that Senate rules, by
requiring a two-thirds majority, made it difficult for impeachment
deliberations to be held in the open. The rules date back to the
impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson, who was narrowly
acquitted in 1868.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not think that waiving Senate rules established by our
distinguished predecessors would improve the quality of our
deliberations,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   But Wellstone said, precedent or not, it's a bad idea to shut
out the American people when a presidency is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, the United States Senate took a vote where we have said
to people in the country, `Now that we go into our deliberations
and make this critical decision about whether a president will be
removed from office, we are only going to do this behind closed
doors,' '' Wellstone said. ``That was the most dangerous thing that
could have happened in a representative democracy. That's why I
feel so strongly about this and have such a sense of
disappointment, and even outrage.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Senate closed the chamber doors on a
non-impeachment matter was April 24, 1997, during a
chemical-weapons debate that held implications for national
security. Before that, the Senate met privately in 1992 to discuss
China's trade status, and several times before that in 1989 during
the impeachment trials of two federal judges. &QL;

OVITZ'S FORMER AGENCY VOWS TO FIGHT HIM FOR HOLLYWOOD CLIENTS
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an aggressive move unusual even in Hollywood, the Creative
Artists Agency retaliated on Monday against Michael Ovitz, its
former chairman, and said it would not share its prestigious list
of clients with the new management company set up by him.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Creative Artists, which was formerly owned by Ovitz
and his partners, was giving an ultimatum to its clients: if an
actor or director joins Ovitz's fledgling management company then
Creative Artists will not represent that person. Last week,
Creative Artists was shaken by the defection of Robin Williams, who
quit the agency to join Ovitz.
</P>
<P>
   So far a number of Creative Artists clients have decided to stay
with the agency but also join Ovitz's management company, called
Artists Management Group. These include the directors Martin
Scorsese and Sydney Pollack, and the actresses Minnie Driver,
Claire Danes, Lauren Holly and Marisa Tomei. It was unclear Monday
night how many of them would stay with Creative Artists, one of the
most powerful talent agencies in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   The Creative Artists decision was highly unusual on several
counts. It is unheard of for a talent agency to openly say it will
not handle clients if they join a specific management company. It
is also highly unusual to engage in a public fight, especially with
someone like Ovitz who has a reputation as an unforgiving and
strong-willed figure. ``This is saying to the town, you can't put
us in the same room together,'' said one veteran movie industry
producer who spoke on condition of anonymity. He added: ``This
rarely happens. This is a declaration of war.''
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz declined to respond to phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   The move by Creative Artists came after Ovitz lured Williams,
one of its top clients, who earns nearly $20 million a film, to his
company, and tried to bring in other agency clients. The move
outraged the leaders of Creative Artists, most of whom were hired
and trained by Ovitz, who began the agency with several partners.
Several of the top agents at Creative Artists, who are mostly in
their 30s and 40s, had seen Ovitz as a mentor, almost a father
figure, until recently.
</P>
<P>
   Although many actors retain agents, if they have managers,
Williams opted to leave Creative Artists entirely. Apparently he
will be represented by two management companies _ Ovitz's as well
as his longtime managers, Morra, Brezner, Steinberg &AMP; Tennenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   How other top agencies respond to the Creative Artists move is
unclear. Jeff Berg, chairman of International Creative Management,
one of the most powerful agencies in Hollywood and a rival of
Creative Artists, had no comment about the open warfare between
Creative Artists and Ovitz. So far, International Creative
Management has the most clients shared with Ovitz because of a
long-standing friendly relationship with Ovitz's partner, Rick
Yorn, and his sister-in law, Julie Silverman-Yorn, who together
represent such clients as Cameron Diaz and Ed Burns.
</P>
<P>
   One top rival agent to Creative Artists said he saw no effort
yet by Ovitz to poach on other talent agencies. ``What he's saying
to CAA is, `I've given this to you, and I can take it away,' '' the
agent said.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz, as well as Ron Meyer, now the president and chief
operating officer of Universal Studios, started Creative Artists
with several partners in the 1970s, and turned it into the most
powerful and feared agency in Hollywood in the late 1980s and early
1990s. Ovitz left the agency in 1993 to serve as president of the
Walt Disney Co. He was dismissed 15 months later by Michael D.
Eisner, the Disney chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz's decision to turn to the management business came last
year, and was plainly an attempt to move into the production of
films and television. Managers are unregulated, can produce films
and television and historically charge 15 percent of clients' fees.
Under California law, managers are only obliged to advise clients
but cannot secure employment or arrange contracts for clients. This
is left in the hands of talent agents or, in some cases, lawyers.
In reality, the line has often been blurred between agents and
managers.
</P>
<P>
   The Creative Artists move was made by its leadership: Richard
Lovett, the agency's president, and five other agents, Brian Lourd,
Lee Gabler, Rick Nicita, Kevin Huvane and David O'Connor. The
leaders of the agency said that, in recent weeks, they had held as
many as 10 private meetings with Ovitz to work out a viable working
arrangement, and were blindsided when he signed up Williams last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an aggressive and hostile move by a competing agent,
although he calls himself a manager,'' said one top Creative
Artists executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said
that Ovitz was ``talking to every client of ours that picks up his
phone calls,'' and added, ``He's talking to everyone in town.''
</P>
<P>
   Creative Artists represents such stars and directors as Tom
Cruise, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Steven Spielberg.

 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMILTON, Bermuda _ This is not a good time to be selling
insurance to large corporations. Companies are buying less
coverage, and the competition for the remaining business _
insurance against everything from factory fires and defective
products to wayward executives _ has been cutthroat, driving prices
lower.
</P>
<P>
   Big insurers like Aetna, and most recently Cigna, have decided
to get out of the commercial business altogether and concentrate on
fields like health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   So why is Brian Duperreault spending billions to get in a
business others are fleeing?
</P>
<P>
   Duperreault's company, Ace Ltd., is an upstart that was founded
here to insure what others dared not. But the company's latest
deal, agreeing earlier this month to buy the Cigna Corp.'s property
and casualty business, for $3.45 billion, is its biggest gamble
yet.
</P>
<P>
   Duperreault (pronounced DO-per-row) contends that he can
successfully run against the wind as a large commercial insurer
using the same strategies that made Ace a top specialist in
insuring against huge disasters with claims running into the
hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cigna deal turns Ace from a frigate into a battleship:
In one stroke, annual sales will rise to $5.5 billion from $1.2
billion, and the number of employees will jump to 9,650 from 650
today and just 50 five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian has a major, major challenge to make this work,'' said
Michael A. Butt, a friend and competitor who is a director of Exel
Ltd., another young Bermuda insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   But if anyone can make the acquisition work, analysts and
industry executives say, it is Duperreault, Ace's 51-year-old chief
executive who was previously a top executive at American
International Group. ``It's a calculated risk,'' Duperreault
acknowledged in an interview here, ``but we think we can get good
profits out of this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cigna deal puts Ace head-to-head with AIG, the American
leader in commercial insurance, on several tacks. And that may be
part of the motivation behind the deal, some say. Duperreault had
risen through the ranks of AIG to be considered a candidate to
succeed Maurice R. Greenberg, the demanding and driven architect of
AIG's success.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the odds that he would succeed Greenberg were pretty
slim, and Duperreault is nothing if not an astute handicapper. At
the time Duperreault was an AIG executive vice president,
Greenberg's two sons were also executives. And there is the elder
Greenberg himself, a relentless dynamo who shows no signs of
leaving the helm.
</P>
<P>
   (Greenberg's eldest son, Jeffrey, 47, later left AIG, and last
week was named president and designated as chief executive of the
insurance broker Marsh &AMP; McLennan.)
</P>
<P>
   The expanded Ace is Duperreault's opportunity to emulate his
onetime mentor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needed a vehicle,'' Butt of Exel said, ``and this vehicle
probably cut 10 years off his plans.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the comparisons to Greenberg, Duperreault
smiled. He admires Greenberg, he said, and has borrowed many of his
techniques. ``I'm always being accused of wanting to create another
AIG,'' he said. ``I want to be similar. But I don't necessarily
want to be them.'' &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The two men do take similar approaches to the business. Like
Greenberg, Duperreault says he is willing to lose business rather
than take on too much risk for too little money. If companies will
not pay the prices his underwriters calculate are necessary to
cover the risk of providing coverage, he will not sell it.
</P>
<P>
   To keep revenues flowing, both are known for finding new
customers by moving into niches where the competition is less
fierce. Ace units, for example, have recently started offering
liability coverage to veterinarians and real estate brokers. They
also now offer corporations coverage against such political risks
as seizure of property by foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
   Duperreault left AIG and New York for the small, but
increasingly important insurance hub of Hamilton to become chief
executive of Ace in 1994. The company was founded nine years
earlier by J.P. Morgan, Marsh &AMP; McLennan and 32 other companies to
provide high levels of liability coverage _ above $100 million _ at
acceptable prices after most insurers backed away and others jacked
up premiums amid a wave of asbestos-related lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Ace, which went public in 1993, has grown rapidly, partly
through acquisitions, buying Tempest Re for $700 million in 1996
and Cat Ltd. last April for about the same amount.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing has quite raised Ace's profile like the Cigna deal.
The businesses being acquired will vault Ace into the top ranks of
global commercial insurance giants. It will also leave Ace with as
much as $2.1 billion in debt and preferred stock as well as
hundreds of millions in potential claims for asbestos and other
environmental hazards _ the very liabilities that chased many big
insurers out of the business in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   On top of everything else, some industry analysts say,
Duperreault paid too much _ perhaps by as much as $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Ira L. Zuckerman of Nutmeg Securities is among the more
skeptical. ``This is a very risky bet at the wrong time,'' he said.
``The whole commercial business in the U.S. is terrible and there
doesn't seem to be any sign of it getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   Duperreault, however, says people are undervaluing the Cigna
business. Discussing strategy in his rosewood and mahogany office
overlooking Hamilton's harbor _ where his own 44-foot schooner is
moored _ Duperreault calls the Cigna business a gem. He is
confident that with the expertise he has been using to get
industry-leading returns on capital, he can turn the Cigna business
into something competitors will have wished they had snared.
</P>
<P>
   By chopping expenses and by further focusing on such
specialities as crop insurance and protection against lost and
damaged marine cargo, he hopes the Cigna units will be hitting
industry earnings targets of 12 to 14 percent in two to three
years.
</P>
<P>
   The new business will help Ace spread its risk geographically.
Before the Cigna deal, Ace had offices in just a handful of major
cities. Now it will be operating throughout Europe, Asia, Latin
America and most of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Cigna business also allows Ace to reduce its risk through
diversification of coverages. Ace's signature business, often
referred to as excess coverage, has been to sell protection to the
world's mightiest corporations against calamities that rarely occur
_ suits for defective products, say, with claims of more than $100
million.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast the Cigna units sell primary coverage to those same
corporations, with claims beginning at relatively low levels and
occurring more often. Cigna also does a big business in workers'
compensation, which will be new for Ace. And it turns a nice profit
overseas on another new product for Ace, a combination of workers'
compensation, health and disability insurance known as ``personal
accident,'' which is sold to individuals and companies.
</P>
<P>
   Duperreault says he is engineering protection against heavy
losses in one of the Cigna units from asbestos and other
environmental claims through reinsurance. And the unit's $4 billion
in reserves may eventually even produce investment profits, he
says. The new debt load is greater than anything Ace has ever had,
he acknowledges, but it is unlikely to total more than 20 percent
of the combined company's capital.
</P>
<P>
   For now, questions about Ace's ability to absorb the new
business persist among some analysts and investors. Ace shares have
come back to earth after leaping 20 percent when the Cigna deal was
first disclosed. But other analysts have confidence that the deal
will be a success and have recommended Ace shares. Such confidence
in large part reflects the industry's high regard for Duperreault.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   His career in insurance began almost by chance. He was a math
major at St. Joseph's College in Philadelphia, and thought of
becoming a professor of mathematics. But while serving in the Army,
and newly married, he decided he wanted a better income than an
academic life could provide. After he was discharged, he researched
job ideas at a library, and came across an unfamiliar term,
``actuary.'' After looking it up in the dictionary, he sent off
letters to insurers. In 1973, he started with AIG, eventually
rising through the ranks to head the company's operations in Japan
and South Korea and then nearly all its international business.
</P>
<P>
   Coming to Bermuda, one of the few remaining British colonies, to
be Ace's chief executive was a bit of a homecoming for Duperreault.
He was born on the island, but left with his mother for Trenton,
N.J., when he was 5 months old. And Bermuda was where he and his
wife, Nancy, spent their honeymoon.
</P>
<P>
   In Hamilton, Duperreault joined a tight-knit coterie of
insurance executives smaller than those in New York or London, but
one with distinct benefits. A growing number of insurers have set
up shop in Bermuda, attracted by its relaxed regulations and lack
of corporate taxes. (While Ace will remain free of corporate taxes,
the Cigna units will still pay taxes in the United States and other
countries in which they operate.)
</P>
<P>
   Like other executives in Bermuda, Duperreault often wears the
island dress of shorts, knee socks and blazer. And he commutes to
Hamilton (population 6,000) from his waterfront mansion on a
metallic blue motor scooter.
</P>
<P>
   But despite working in an industry in which many executives
carry personal computers and thrive on e-mail, Duperreault is an
old-style manager, traveling almost empty-handed and barely
touching the computer behind his desk.
</P>
<P>
   He has his assistant summarize e-mail messages, faxes and voice
mail, then dictates replies to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more efficient,'' he said.

 &HT;    Impeachment vote puts heavy load on vulnerable senators
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Around town, guys like Sen. Mike DeWine have a
nickname.
</P>
<P>
   They're called ``vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the members of the United States Senate, acting as jurors
in the impeachment trial of President Clinton, are likely to vote
on whether the popular president should be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the question is a matter of private conscience for
each Senator. But political observers and activists note that this
memorable vote could have special significance to Republicans like
DeWine who are seeking reelection in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly, Republicans from states like Ohio that helped
reelect Clinton in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's on my watch list,'' said Stuart Rothenberg, a
Washington-based analyst who publishes a popular political report.
``He fits nicely into the category of Republicans who should be
followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in the group are Sens. Spencer Abraham of Michigan, Rick
Santorum of Pennsylvania, John Ashcroft of Missouri and Rod Gramms
of Minnesota. (Ohio's other senator, the just-elected George
Voinovich, won't face voters until 2004).
</P>
<P>
   The problem these campaigning Senators will face is pleasing the
conservative base that expects a vote for Clinton's ouster, while
not alienating the electorate as a whole, which polls show support
letting Clinton finish his White House term.
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg said this is why all of the ``vulnerable'' Senators
have studiously avoided making public comments that might hint at
how they might vote. Even DeWine, who has made many television
appearances, refuses to answer any questions about the case against
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely low-keyed it,'' Rothenberg said. ``He's talked
just about process.''
</P>
<P>
   DeWine has said he favors a complete trial rather than a
truncated proceeding that skips evidence to reach a swift
conclusion. This has pleased the chairman of the Ohio affiliate of
the Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Roseanne Siderits of Warren County, who represents part of that
conservative core, said she doesn't expect the impeachment vote to
be a driving issue for her group in the 2000 election. She
acknowledges that's because a vote to remove Clinton is her group's
bottom-line position.
</P>
<P>
   ``To hold on to his base,'' she said, ``(DeWine) is going to
have to support impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   And Siderits argues that DeWine, who is Catholic and solidly
opposed to abortion, has a more tenuous hold on that base than one
might expect. Over the years, DeWine has worked across party lines
on issues that have given him a reputation for being, at least
sometimes, moderate. He even drew the praise of venerable liberal
columnist Mary McGrory at The Washington Post two years ago for
being ``the real thing'' on children's issues.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Siderits said, DeWine has gone too far. She said
he has supported too many ``big-government'' proposals, such as the
Workforce Development Act that provides training programs for
people coming off welfare. She also disliked his failed attempt to
link federal highway money to lowering the illegal blood-alcohol
level of drivers nationwide; she said it smacks of social
engineering by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Such efforts have generated ``undercurrents that people aren't
happy with him,'' Siderits said.
</P>
<P>
   But Greg Abernathy of the Ohio Republican Party said he's not so
sure DeWine is in trouble. The 2000 election is a long way off, he
said, adding that most voters will respect DeWine's decision on
impeachment so long as he continues to show that he's giving it his
most thoughtful consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Sen. DeWine is considered vulnerable, then the Republican
Party is in very good shape,'' Abernathy said. ``You don't like to
take anything for granted, but this is a guy who has tremendous
respect among Republicans and Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Abernathy conceded that current polls suggest the public is more
unhappy with Republican pursuers of impeachment than with the
president they've targeted.
</P>
<P>
   But he said Election Day is ``a long way away...You could take a
poll on anything now and it doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   That's also in dispute. David Leland, chairman of the Ohio
Democratic Party, said the campaign season is only a year away.
``That's when we start reminding people of how he voted, so that's
not far off at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Leland said his party hasn't settled on a candidate to challenge
DeWine, and admits that DeWine might be more vulnerable these days
if the Democratic Party in Ohio had a larger palette of weighty
candidates. Excluding judicial elections, the last Democrat to win
a statewide race was John Glenn, who was reelected to the Senate in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   But Leland expects DeWine to vote for Clinton's removal _ ``He
has to'' _ and that will help whoever runs against him.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Republicans rejected a Democratic proposal
on Monday to end the trial of President Clinton that would have
dispensed with witnesses and then would have moved to a debate on
articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they worked behind the scenes with the House Republican
prosecutors to draw up a witness list small enough to win a
majority vote in the Senate, where a few Republicans and almost all
Democrats do not want to hear witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuvering came as the Senate entered a decisive week,
heading toward a pair of critical votes on whether to dismiss the
case outright and whether to approve witnesses. The Senate debated
the first issue in a secret session Monday night, but votes will
come either Tuesday or Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, fearful of further partisan strife after the
weekend turmoil over the House questioning of Monica Lewinsky,
Sens. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., and Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., offered
both parties a proposal. They suggested that the votes on dismissal
and witnesses be skipped and that the trial move to closing debate,
with a vote on the articles of impeachment on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman described the plan as a ``mutual withdrawal of
forces'' under which Democrats would drop the effort to dismiss the
case outright and Republicans would not push for witnesses. It was
presented to the Democrats and Republicans at separate caucuses
Monday morning, and Sen. Tom Daschle, the minority leader,
announced that Democrats could support the plan.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the Republican caucus was still under way, John
Czwartacki, the spokesman for Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader,
said the idea had been ``summarily rejected.'' Republicans said
that their caucus was divided, with some people exhausted and leery
of witnesses but others still wanting to give the House prosecutors
the right to move forward with their case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard for me to envision as a trier of fact who has taken
an oath, judging this case, without seeing the most important
witness or witnesses,'' said Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio. Sen. Tim
Hutchinson, R-Ark., said there was a ``difference of opinion''
among Republicans over the need for witnesses. ``Everybody would
like this thing to end, and they hate to think of a couple of more
weeks of depositions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After rejecting the offer, Senate Republicans summoned some of
the House managers to the Capitol to winnow the prosecutors' list
of half a dozen witnesses down to two or three, in hopes that such
a list could win a majority vote later this week, perhaps even
winning some Democratic support.
</P>
<P>
   And to keep pressure on the White House, Lott and nine other
senators submitted 10 written questions to President Clinton,
taking advantage of an opening that the White House had given them
and then retracted on Saturday. They asked that he respond ``in
writing and under oath'' to the questions, which began by asking if
everything the president had testified to in the case brought by
Paula Jones was true.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not,'' the question continued, ``what did you testify to
that you now believe is not truthful? Please begin your answer with
a yes or no.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, said neither the
president nor his lawyers would respond to the questions, which he
said violated the bipartisan deal on trial procedures. ``I'd
suggest this has more to do with playing politics than with trying
to bring this to a fair and expeditious conclusion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the two parties once again parted ways, efforts
persisted to search for a bipartisan solution. Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, called Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., seeking support
for a two-person witness list and a date certain to end the trial.
After consulting Daschle, Kennedy relayed the message that the
Democrats were standing firm against witnesses, according to one
Democratic official.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One attempt at negotiation took place openly in front of a
cluster of reporters when Max Baucus, D-Mont., stopped abruptly in
the Senate's subway to ask Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, if the
Republicans had embraced the plan to move to the end of the trial.
``Could you think of an element that might help?'' Baucus asked.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley wondered in return whether Democratic opposition to
witnesses would extend to ``even a very circumscribed form for
witnesses, depositions, just a short period of time?'' Baucus said
it probably would, and the two men went their separate ways.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Facing a deadline of Tuesday to submit their witness list to the
Senate, the House managers _ a day after interviewing Ms. Lewinsky
_ began the day badly divided over how to proceed. Bowing to the
Senate's reluctance to call a large number of witnesses, some of
the prosecutors were willing to cull their list down to two or
three people, including Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But others continued to insist they needed to go beyond Ms.
Lewinsky and call a core group of five witnesses, to make their
case, including the White House aides and advisers Betty Currie,
Vernon Jordan, John Podesta, Sidney Blumenthal. There was also
interest in Clinton's former political consultant, Dick Morris.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate is over who should be added and whether they'd be
accepted by the Senate,'' Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., said after a
midday meeting of the prosecutors. ``We believe in our case and we
want a way to present it, and we're going to keep arguing that
point to the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as the meeting was ending, some of the prosecutors,
including Hutchinson and Rep. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina,
were summoned to a Capitol office by a small group of Senate
Republicans, including Sen. Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania
Republican, to discuss the witness issue.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By Monday night, the four prosecutors who will make the case for
witnesses on Tuesday _ Hutchinson, James Rogan of California, Ed
Bryant of Tennessee and Bill McCollum of Florida _ were paring down
the list, and one Republican aide said there would probably be no
more than three submitted to the Senate. Even earlier in the day
Rogan had signaled that they would move in this direction. ``We've
got to prioritize and get down to a bare minimum and not run the
risk of getting zero witnesses because we put on one too many,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Ms. Lewinsky, it was not certain which witnesses the
prosecutors would settle on. They were to meet again on Tuesday
before the session.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate went into closed session Monday night to debate the
motion by Sen. Robert Byrd to dismiss the trial. But the pair of
votes on that motion and on witnesses are not expected until late
Tuesday night or Wednesday. Lott said confidently that the
Republicans who control the chamber 55-45 ``have the votes'' to
block dismissal of the case.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And suggesting that even some Democrats might oppose dismissal,
Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., tried unsuccessfully to have the
vote on stopping the case, separated into two votes, one for each
article of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It was less certain how the Senate will vote on witnesses.
Several Republicans have expressed unease at extending the trial by
calling the principals in the case. But it was not clear how many
of them would vote with Democrats against witnesses. If all 45
Democrats hold together to oppose witnesses, then six Republicans
are needed to prevent further testimony. And some of the wavering
lawmakers are likely to be swayed by the scope of the House witness
list.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody can show me that this will change the dynamics of
the trial,'' said Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., ``that's a different
story. I don't believe that's going to happen. But I haven't closed
my mind totally yet.'' He said a number of Republicans shared his
concern.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were also exploring whether they could end the trial
by voting on a statement of facts on each of the articles of
impeachment and then separately on the articles themselves. That
would allow senators to make a statement that Clinton had committed
perjury and obstructed justice as the House charged, but not to
remove him from office. Democrats said they would oppose such a
plan as unconstitutional.

 &HT;    Court OKs FCC setting rules in phone fray
 &HT;    By Bruce Hight
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In a ruling that may mean some consumers will
get more choices for local phone service faster and cheaper, the
Supreme Court on Monday affirmed the authority of the Federal
Communications Commission to lay down the rules for how
Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. and other Baby Bells must deal with
new competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court rejected arguments from Southwestern Bell
owner SBC Communications Inc. of San Antonio and other Bell
companies that states, not the Federal Communications Commission,
should write those rules.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Wood, chairman of the Texas Public Utility Commission, said
the court's decision _ though important _ probably would not have
much impact in Texas. That's because the PUC already enacted rules
similar to the FCC's under the federal Telecommunications Act of
1996.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in as many weeks that the Supreme Court
turned down the Bells. Last week, the court refused to consider a
case in which SBC challenged the constitutionality of a provision
in the 1996 act that keeps it and other Bells out of the
long-distance business without FCC approval.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's ruling upheld rules approved by the FCC under the 1996
law that determined how Southwestern Bell and other Bell companies
must make their various network services available to competitors
and regulated the rates they could charge for those services.
</P>
<P>
   The Bells, including SBC, had won a ruling by the 8th U.S. Court
of Appeals in St. Louis that said those decisions should be left to
the states.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling is a big, although not complete, victory for the
government's goal of speedily letting customers nationwide choose
their local phone company much as they now can choose a
long-distance company. Supporters of local phone competition say
they think competition will lead to lower prices _ like the 70
percent drop in long-distance costs after long distance competition
was introduced during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Most long distance companies have said they want to offer local
phone service, but have complained about resistance from the Bells.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Hibbs, a spokesman for AT&AMP;T in Texas, said with the loss
of two major court cases, ``maybe even SBC will get the message
that the Supreme Court's trying to tell them something, namely,
quit filing lawsuits and open your monopoly to competition as
mandated by the federal telecom act.''
</P>
<P>
   SBC issued a terse statement, saying it ``will continue to work
with the FCC and state regulators'' to boost ``full and fair
competition'' in local phone markets. It said it already has lost
about 2 million phone lines to competitors; it serves about 37
million lines.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Land, executive director of the Texas Association of
Long Distance Companies, said he hoped the Supreme Court ruling
``means the Texas commission will go ahead and do some of the
things it had been hesitant to do.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Land said, the Supreme Court's decision upholds an
FCC rule that a reseller can pick and choose among network services
from Southwestern Bell without paying additional charges just to
combine those particular services.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court, Justice Antonin Scalia said the FCC has
general jurisdiction to implement the local-competition provisions
of the 1996 law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be gross understatement to say that the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 is not a model of clarity,'' Scalia
wrote. ``It is in many important respects a model of ambiguity or
indeed even self-contradiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Congress is well aware that the ambiguities it chooses to
produce in a statute will be resolved by the implementing agency. .
. . We can only enforce the clear limits that the 1996 act
contains,'' Scalia added.
</P>
<P>
   The vote to let the FCC set the pricing rules was 5-3. Joining
Scalia were Justices John Paul Stevens, David Souter, Anthony
Kennedy and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Chief Justice William Rehnquist
and Justices Clarence Thomas and Stephen Breyer dissented.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who long has owned AT&AMP;T stock, did
not participate.

SENATE ARGUES TO DISMISS CHARGES AGAINST CLINTON BEHIND CLOSED
DOORS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate argued in closed session late Monday
night over a Democratic proposal to dismiss the charges against
President Clinton and end his impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Senate doors were closed to the public, House
Republicans argued passionately against dismissing the case and
renewed their plea to summon witnesses to help determine, as one
prosecutor said, ``if our president is a criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguments on whether to summon witnesses are to begin at noon
EST Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, the doors were shut on the Senate's deliberations
after a 57-43 vote, largely along party lines, to block a bid by
Democrats to conduct only the second presidential impeachment
debate in U.S. history in open session and on national television.
</P>
<P>
   The secret session began as the White House announced that
Clinton would ignore a series of written questions from Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and other Republican senators
seeking to clear up conflicts in the evidence. The president is not
required by law to respond to the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on dangerous, dangerous ground,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin,
a Iowa Democrat who co-sponsored the motion along with Sen. Paul
Wellstone, D-Minn., to open Senate impeachment deliberations to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a throwback to the dark ages. This is not a private
club,'' Harkin said.
</P>
<P>
   The closing of the Senate chamber during Monday night's
deliberations came under an impeachment rule that says ``debate by
senators on any question is not allowed in open session.'' At the
same time, Senate rules call for all votes to be cast in open
session.
</P>
<P>
   Three Republicans _ Susan Collins of Maine, Kay Bailey Hutchison
of Texas and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania _ broke with their
colleagues to join 40 Democrats in voting for the Harkin-Wellstone
effort to hold an open debate. No votes are expected until later
Tuesday or possibly Wednesday on the motion by Sen. Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., to dismiss the case against the nation's 42nd president.
Before the vote on dismissing the case, House prosecutors are
expected to propose a list of people they want to question.
</P>
<P>
   Among the witnesses is Monica Lewinsky, a former White House
intern whose affair with Clinton burst into the open a year ago,
triggering an investigation that led to the Senate trial. Clinton
is accused of lying to a grand jury and obstructing justice in
trying to keep the affair secret.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers, 13 Republicans who are prosecuting the case
against Clinton, winnowed their list of potential witnesses to keep
wavering Republican senators from siding with Democrats when a vote
is taken late Tuesday, possibly Wednesday, on whether to seek live
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   While Lewinsky remains at the top of the list, House prosecutors
were interested in questioning presidential secretary Betty Currie
and Clinton friend Vernon Jordan. While prosecutors were still
trying to decide whether to summon White House Chief of Staff John
Podesta and aide Sydney Blumenthal, they had scratched from the
list Kathleen Willey and other women who have alleged that Clinton
made unwelcome sexual advances.
</P>
<P>
   The president's defense team, which has consistently opposed
bringing witnesses into the well of the Senate, urged approval of
Byrd's motion to end the trial. ``The case cannot be made,'' said
Nicole Seligman, a private lawyer who is part of the Clinton
defense. ``It is time to end it.''
</P>
<P>
   Seligman said the articles of impeachment, which were approved
in a party-line vote by the Republican-controlled House, are too
vague and improperly structured and would have been dismissed in a
criminal court. She argued that prosecutors have failed to prove
Clinton guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeachment was never meant to be just another weapon in the
arsenal of partisanship,'' Seligman said. ``By definition, a
partisan split like that which accompanied these articles from the
House of Representatives creates doubt that makes plain the
constitutional error of the course that we are on.''
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors urged the Senate to reject Byrd's motion and
allow witness testimony before voting on the impeachment articles
charging the president with perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to resolve if our president is a criminal,'' urged
Rep. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and one of the
House prosecutors. Dismissing the charges, Graham said, would be
like saying ``we're sort of just kidding, Mr. President.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, the lead prosecutor, said aborting the trial
before witnesses are called would mean that ``charges of perjury,
obstruction of justice are summarily dismissed, disregarded,
ignored, brushed off, and these are charges that send ordinary folk
to jail every day of the week and remove federal judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this whole sad, sad drama will end, we will
never get it behind us until you vote up or down on the articles
(of impeachment),'' Hyde said. ``When you do, however you vote,
we'll all collect our papers, bow from the waist, thank you for
your courtesy, and leave, and go gently into the night.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Lott and several other Republicans sent 10 sets of
questions to the White House asking Clinton to provide written
responses they felt ``should prove beneficial in our efforts to
reconcile conflicting testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said Clinton would not respond
to the questions, saying the White House did not want to go down
``political paths that are not constructive.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to avoid the partisan rancor that marked the House debate
on the articles of impeachment, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, met
Monday with Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., to seek an agreement
to question a limited number of witnesses in private before a final
vote on the charges against Clinton. No deal was struck.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, several Senate Republicans were discussing a
proposed ``finding of fact'' that would be introduced as a
resolution stating that Clinton had violated laws against lying
under oath and obstructing justice. The resolution could be
approved by a simple majority of the 100-member Senate, which is
expected to fall short of the 67 votes needed to convict Clinton
and remove him from office. The Senate has 55 Republicans and 45
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who is presiding
over the Senate trial of the president, rejected a Democratic
senator's effort to stop Lewinsky from meeting privately with House
prosecutors, who recruited independent counsel Kenneth Starr to
force her to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, Rehnquist wrote that
``it is quite debatable whether merely interviewing a witness''
would violate impeachment trial rules requiring Senate approval
before taking sworn testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Three prosecutors interviewed Lewinsky for almost two hours
Sunday afternoon. While they characterized the session as
productive and said it bolsters their argument for including
witnesses in the trial, Lewinsky's lawyer Plato Cacheris said she
told the prosecutors nothing that was not already in evidence
before the Senate.

MARKET PLACE: UBS PLANS TO REDUCE INTERNATIONAL LENDING
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ill., Conn.)   (Eds.: Budgeted earlier as SWITZERLAND-BANK) 
(fb) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Still recovering from its disastrous
investment in derivatives last year, UBS AG of Switzerland
announced a broad retreat on Monday from some of its riskier areas
of lending and investment banking.
</P>
<P>
   UBS, the world's largest bank in terms of assets until the
merger of Bankers Trust by Deutsche Bank AG is completed, said it
would sharply reduce its international lending, as well as
investment in distressed loans, lease financing, commodities
trading and other niches.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy, outlined Monday at a meeting with analysts in
Zurich, amounts to reducing both risk and the prospects for higher
profits. Bank executives said they had cut their profit goals for
the year 2002 by about 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's moves also mark a reversal from recent efforts to
push into newer and more profitable businesses and refocus on more
traditional areas like private banking for wealthy customers.
</P>
<P>
   The bank insisted that it would not sell or abandon its
investment banking unit, Warburg Dillon Read, which lost 878
million francs ($639 million) in the first nine months of 1998. But
executives said they would place much more emphasis on building its
private banking and asset-management services like pension fund and
mutual fund management. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Monday's moves mark UBS's first attempt to outline its strategy
since its catastrophic investment in Long-Term Capital Management,
the hedge fund based in Greenwich, Conn., that lost billions of
dollars last year. UBS lost 790 million Swiss francs through
Long-Term Capital, its second big loss in two years as a result of
investing in exotic currency futures and other financial derivative
products. UBS's loss was the biggest sustained by a European bank,
and it forced UBS's chairman, Mathis Cabiallavetta, and three other
top executives to resign last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Cabiallavetta had orchestrated UBS's $29 billion merger last
year with the Swiss Bank Corp. and had been intent on transforming
the conservative and somewhat stodgy UBS into a more energetic and
profitable institution.
</P>
<P>
   UBS is expected to name Cabiallavetta's permanent successor on
Wednesday, and most industry executives believe it will be Alex
Krauer, the head of Switzerland's pharmaceutical conglomerate
Novartis AG Krauer has been UBS's interim chairman for the last
several months.
</P>
<P>
   UBS has not broken into the top ranks of investment banks in the
United States. But analysts said it had become a successful niche
player in some financial markets, one of the few foreign banks
thought to have a chance of competing with big American brokerage
houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the industry thought that if any non-U.S. firm had a
shot of becoming more successful here, it was them,'' said Guy
Moszkowski, brokerage industry analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   By scaling back its investment banking ambitions, UBS might
reduce heated competition among banks that had led to price cutting
for some services and bidding wars to hire top-performing bankers.
``Many banks will see this as positive, in that it could help
relieve pricing pressure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the closed-door meeting with analysts, UBS executives said
they had reduced the bank's ``risk appetite'' by half. Among other
things, the bank is weighing the possibility of selling Warburg's
trade-finance business, which provides loans to companies selling
products in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   These moves are expected to free up a significant amount of
capital, which UBS executives said might be used for further
acquisitions or for buying back the bank's own stock.
</P>
<P>
   But the bank made it clear that it had little or no appetite for
additional big acquisitions. Hans Kaufmann, banking analyst at Bank
Julius Baer in Zurich, said UBS had allocated about 500 million
Swiss francs for acquisitions by Warburg Dillon Read, which would
rule out any major American takeovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not yet back to the good times, but things are
developing nicely,'' Kaufmann said. ``The earnings will not be
higher, but they will be of better quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's meeting was a debut performance for David Solo, a
33-year-old American who was named chief risk officer after the
Long-Term Capital affair. Solo, who came to UBS from O'Connor
Securities, a Chicago-based money-management firm that Warburg
Dillon Read acquired, was handed the job of figuring out how to
reduce the bank's exposure to problems like Long-Term Capital
without jeopardizing its global competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Solo has yet to make any appearances in public, but analysts who
attended Monday's meeting said he made a good impression.

 &HT;    Five Trammell Crow leaders to form their own company
 &HT;    By R. Michelle Breyer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The leaders of Austin's biggest commercial real
estate company _ including its regional president _ will leave the
company March 1 with plans to start their own firm.
</P>
<P>
   Bryce Miller, Jeff Newberg, Andy Pastor, David Roche and Kirk
Rudy _ five of the seven principals at Trammell Crow Co.'s Austin
office _ plan to start an as-yet-unnamed real estate development
and acquisition company specializing in retail, office and
industrial properties.
</P>
<P>
   Trammell Crow principal Stan Erwin, who has been with the
company for 14 years, will take over as Austin city leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in great hands,'' said Trammell Crow Chairman J.
McDonald Williams, who was in Austin Monday. ``We've got a great
team in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudy, the company's Austin city leader and managing director,
said it was the entrepreneurial spirit that led to the decision to
leave, not any weakness at Trammell Crow.
</P>
<P>
   The five executives are departing Trammell Crow after the best
year in the company's history _ both nationwide and in Austin. The
local office, which has 125 employees, has consistently been among
the five most profitable of the 34 cities where Trammell Crow does
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trammell Crow and the Austin office have a rich history of
incubating and fostering entrepreneurship,'' Rudy said. ``It's our
turn to determine if we can create a real estate firm on our own.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing also was right financially for them to branch out on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   Trammell Crow went public in November 1997, raising $90 million
to fund the company's growth. The Austin leadership group _ all
original shareholders _ collectively will take in excess of half a
million shares of Trammell Crow stock. At Monday's close of $22.25
a share, that's more than $11 million _ money that will help fund
their new business. Under Securities and Exchange Commission rules,
Trammell Crow employees had to wait until Dec. 1, 1998 to sell
their stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time is right for us to pursue the dream we've all had
individually,'' said Miller, regional president and a 15-year
veteran of Trammell Crow.
</P>
<P>
   They began seriously talking about forming their own company in
November. On Jan. 8, they notified Trammell Crow officials of their
intention to leave. On Thursday, they told co-workers in an
announcement that one Trammell Crow employee likened to finding out
a relative had died.
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, the group has more than 65 years of experience
with Trammell Crow in office, industrial and retail leasing,
management and development.
</P>
<P>
   Trammell Crow opened its Austin office in 1971, and during the
past three years has been a major player in the Austin development
scene. Recent projects include Research Park, Expo Business Park,
new buildings at Promontory Point Business Park and the Stonelake
Office Building.
</P>
<P>
   It also has been aggressively expanding its Austin presence,
recruiting several top-name real estate brokers from other
commercial firms. The company has added close to 50 people over the
past seven years.
</P>
<P>
   The company now leases and manages 12.5 million square feet of
office, retail and industrial space in the Austin area. Nationwide,
it manages or leases 472 million square feet.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Trammell Crow has lost its top local
leadership. Over a 12-month period in 1992-93, company veterans
Richard Hill, Sandy Gottesman and Mark Palmer all left to start
their own real estate development companies. They left at a time
when the company had moved away from development and into leasing,
sales and property management. News of the Trammell Crow departures
surprised many local real estate executives.
</P>
<P>
   Although many commercial real estate brokers regularly change
jobs, moving to new firms or starting their own, it is unusual for
so many principals to leave at the same time, said Jerry Lumsden,
managing director in Austin for another real estate company, CB
Richard Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, with a market as good and as active as this one,
nothing surprises me,'' Lumsden said.

U.S. MISSILE MISFIRE MAY HAVE KILLED IRAQI CIVILIANS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ American warplanes on Monday attacked several
air-defense sites in northern and southern Iraq, and the Pentagon
said that at least one missile misfired and might have killed
several civilians in a residential neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq, eager to rally international opposition to the American
and British control of most of its skies, asserted that 11
civilians died and 59 others were injured in an unprovoked attack
by American jets in an area called al-Jumhuriya, near the southern
port city of Basra.
</P>
<P>
   In previous clashes, Iraq has claimed scores of civilian
casualties and damage to residential and commercial areas from
American raids that later proved unfounded. After Monday's clashes,
foreign journalists in Iraq reported seeing several damaged or
destroyed homes in the area and interviewed civilians who had been
injured.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, the commander of American forces in the
Persian Gulf region, said the Pentagon had not yet determined if
one of the American jets involved in Monday's clashes was
responsible, but he confirmed that at least one missile had gone
astray, missing its target.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon on Monday afternoon, Zinni said that American
planes patrolling the skies over southern Iraq had attacked Iraqi
air defenses after four Soviet-built MiG fighters flew into the
southern ``no flight'' zone in what he described as an effort to
lure the Americans into range of surface-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We deeply regret any civilian casualties, regardless of what
the cause may be, but these exchanges have been initiated by Saddam
Hussein,'' he said. ``This has been a deliberate set of repeated
attacks against our forces.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the third consecutive day of clashes in Iraq's skies
after a weeklong lull around the end of Ramadan, the Islamic holy
month of prayer and fasting. But Monday's clashes _ with American
and Iraqi forces trading fire in the north and south _ were the
most intense since the United States and Britain launched four
nights of attacks against Iraq last month.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a series of skirmishes with Iraqi air-defense forces
since last month's raids, the Clinton administration has vowed to
continue patrolling the ``no flight'' zones, which the United
States and its allies created after the Persian Gulf war ended in
1991 to protect ethnic populations facing repression from President
Saddam Hussein's forces.
</P>
<P>
   Given Iraq's diplomatic isolation, administration officials say
they are prepared to continue patiently striking air-defense sites
when American or British pilots feel threatened.
</P>
<P>
   One defense official said that pilots try to avoid military
targets Iraq has put in residential areas, something Zinni accused
Hussein's military of doing.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican on Monday criticized the latest air strikes, going
so far as to call them aggression. Clinton is expected to meet with
Pope John Paul II during his visit to St. Louis on Tuesday and
Vatican officials have said Iraq will be among the topics of
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's actions in Iraq came under criticism in
Washington, too, though for a different reason. Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., called on Clinton to authorize larger strikes to knock out
Iraq's air defenses. He said it was ``just damn foolishness'' to
put pilots at risk to keep responding to Iraq's provocations by
striking individual weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's clashes, two F-15Es based in Kuwait and four F/A-18s
from the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson did not wait to be attacked
before striking. Defense officials, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said the American jets struck at three air-defense sites
near Basra after detecting the MiG jets attempting to lure them
into fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than go after the bait, they went after the trap,'' one
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said it was too soon to assess the damage caused by
the strikes. The errant missile was a precision-guided missile
fired from one of the F-15s, the officials said. The missile, which
carries a 2,000 pound bomb capable of causing considerable damage,
could have misfired because of a human error or a mechanical one.
</P>
<P>
   In northern Iraq, two American F-15Es attacked an Iraqi
anti-aircraft artillery battery that fired on them near Mosul. In
separate incidents in the same area, an F-16C/J and an EA-6B each
fired radar-seeking missiles at Soviet-era SA-2 surface-to-air
missile sites.

 &HT;    Bush defends social promotion plan
 &HT;    By A. Phillips Brooks
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush took the offensive Monday in
promoting a retooled plan to end social promotions, waving off
characterizations that it's a milder _ if not watered down _
version of his campaign proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to begin the process of putting an end to social
promotions in Texas schools,'' Bush said at Hillcrest Elementary, a
blue-ribbon school in Del Valle, Texas. ``This plan is designed to
use the TAAS as an early warning device to get students help early
when it's most effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush joined lawmakers at the school to announce the filing of
legislation aimed at ending social promotion _ the practice of
advancing failing students to the next grade to keep them with
their peers.
</P>
<P>
   During a year-long campaign, Bush drew a hard line in the
political sand, saying that even third-graders who flunked the
reading portion of the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS)
would be retained regardless of their grades.
</P>
<P>
   But two weeks ago, Bush backed away from that line by announcing
his support for a key change in the proposal: allowing schools to
promote students who flunk the TAAS three times after going through
an appeals process.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, he broke an impasse among legislators and education
groups opposed to the ``no-TAAS, no-pass'' provision of his plan.
Since that time, support has been broad and swift, coming from
teachers groups and school board associations.
</P>
<P>
   But critics have also been fast in asking whether the revision
amounts to a retreat by the Republican governor, who a year ago was
asked whether there would be any way under his plan that a student
would be promoted to fourth grade without passing the third grade
TAAS.
</P>
<P>
   ``No there's not,'' Bush replied then.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, flanked by ranking legislators and Education
Commissioner Mike Moses, Bush used a color chart to detail his
plan. He explained his evolving plan was the result of listening to
experts and parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The details of this legislation are a product of about nine
months worth of meetings with educators, legislators, teachers and
parents,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Bush's retooled plan, third-graders _ beginning in the
2002-03 _ would have to pass the reading portion of the TAAS.
Grades five and eight would be phased in, so when the same group of
students became fifth-graders they would have to pass the reading
and math TAAS exams in 2004-05 and when they became eighth-graders
they would have to pass all sections, reading, writing and
mathematics in 2007-08.
</P>
<P>
   Students would get three chances on the test and receive
remedial help, tutoring, or summer school, with each failure. Bush
is seeking over $200 million from the Legislature to pay for
remedial programs and training for teachers to improve reading
instruction.
</P>
<P>
   If students do not pass the TAAS on the third try, parents may
appeal the retention to a grade placement committee made up of a
parent, teacher and principal. The committee can promote the
student by unanimous consent.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Paul Sadler, D-Henderson and chairman of the House Public
Education Committee, agreed that the appeals process does not water
down Bush's goal of halting social promotions.

   ``You have heard and I have heard. . .of a child who performs
extremely well academically, but for some reason can not pass the
standardized test,'' said Sadler. ``Now what kind of heartless and
ruthless people would we (be) if we said to those parents, ``Too
bad, your child is going to stay in the third grade forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Teel Bivins, R-Amarillo, chairman of the Senate Education
Committee, said the bill also includes sanctions to discourage
schools from abusing the appeals process. Ultimately, a school or
district's state ranking could be influenced if too many students
who flunk the TAAS are promoted, Bivins said.
</P>
<P>
   The state annually ranks schools and districts largely on
student TAAS scores. The TAAS, which measures basic skills in
reading, writing and mathematics, is given to students in grades
three through eight. Tenth-graders must pass an exit TAAS by the
time they graduate to receive their diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   But not all lawmakers accepted Bush's rosy assessment of the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Royce West, D-Dallas and member of the Senate Education
Committee, questioned whether Bush's plan includes enough money to
get students the help they need to pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be sure that before we start talking about holding
kids back, we are providing the necessary resources to give them
the help they need to pass standardized tests,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997-98 school year, 219,000 third-graders took the
reading TAAS and 42,000 flunked. Of those, about 38,000 were
promoted to fourth grade, according to the Texas Education Agency.
And a 1996 survey by the Texas Federation of Teachers concluded
that 150,000 students are promoted in Texas each year without
passing their courses.
</P>
<P>
   West, noting that a majority of the four million schoolchildren
enrolled in Texas public schools are Hispanic or black, said he is
not certain whether $200 million would be enough to overcome
deficiencies that persist in urban or poor schools. Minority
children, he said, tend to score lower than white students on the
TAAS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that $50 per child on average?'' he asked.

BIG-SPENDING GOLF FANS GET BIG PERKS

<P>
   PHOENIX _ While you're stuck in traffic, helicopters zip
big-shot golf fans to the Phoenix Open in minutes.
</P>
<P>
   While you run to snare a good spot in the gallery, people breeze
through a lane carved in the mob for a reserved place at the front
of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   When you sit on the grass with a hot dog and a soda, some golf
fans dine on catered food, relax on plush furniture and plan an
evening at a private club at the Tournament Players Club of
Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400,000 golf fans from all over the world will
converge on the TPC this week for the Phoenix Open. For many, it's
inexpensive entertainment _ a few bucks at the gate and a few more
for something to eat _ and a chance to see the world's best
golfers.
</P>
<P>
   For others, it's a big-money extravaganza, a chance to spoil
themselves, friends or clients. They'll spend hundreds, and in many
cases, thousands, for the chance to hang out at the golf course in
luxury.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're wined and dined. Wherever you go it's never ending.
There's never a tray that's not filled,'' Kenny Stein, sales
manager at Childress Buick, said of the hospitality clients at the
Arizona Buick Dealers tent at the golf course's Corporate Village.
</P>
<P>
   The Thunderbirds, the group that puts the tournament together,
don't miss a trick when it comes to marketing the event, a strategy
that raised $3 million for charity at last year's Open.
</P>
<P>
   They've packaged the Open for companies that want to show
clients a good time, creating a tent town called Corporate Village
overlooking the 18th fairway and the 17th green. Price of admission
for a company that wants to set up a tent: $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   That gives companies a big package of perks, including valet and
reserved parking, badges for the tournament and access to the
Corporate Nest, a private enclave for drinking and entertainment
that lets bigwigs avoid the raucous, crowded Bird's Nest bar.
</P>
<P>
   John Mistler, the Thunderbirds chairman for the Corporate
Village, said people invited to the tents get plenty of special
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``People do things from handing out hats to handing out golf
packages,'' he said. ``Some people fly in customers in
helicopters.''
</P>
<P>
   The tents also give companies a chance to meet clients and
potential clients in a relaxed setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can have any kind of food they want,'' Mistler said.
``You get out of the sunshine and it creates an intimate
atmosphere. You can sit down with a client or a prospect. It's a
huge networking opportunity. And you can go out on the deck and
watch the best golfers in the world go by.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies that don't need that kind of space can schmooze it up
at Sky Box Village. People lucky enough to be invited to one of the
boxes enjoy free admission to the tournament, a catered buffet,
lunch and open bar, and some get valet and reserved parking.
</P>
<P>
   The boxes have a view of the 16th and 17th fairways. And this
year the Thunderbirds offered dual-level ``penthouse'' skyboxes for
$75,000 after giving the concept a test run last year. All of the
approximately 65 boxes _ including the double-deckers _ sold out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole point is entertainment,'' said Gil Brito,
Thunderbirds Sky Box chairman. ``It's a very nice location to watch
multiple golf holes. There are places to sit, places to get food
and drink and sit down and enjoy the golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Golf fans who just want to treat themselves _ or companies that
want to hand out a valuable freebie _ can spend $1,500 for a
GolfWatch credential. The Thunderbirds say GolfWatch, a package
offered by a Colorado company, is like having a courtside seat at
an NBA game.
</P>
<P>
   A GolfWatch badge lets people zip through galleries in special
lanes. They always sit at the front of the gallery on special
portable seats.
</P>
<P>
   GolfWatchers also get access to the GolfWatch Home Pavilion near
the 18th hole. The place is set up with food, phones, satellite TV
and other services.
</P>
<P>
   ``They totally pamper their customers and take care of their
needs,'' said Rob McGarey, Thunderbirds GolfWatch chairman.
``They'll tell you what certain stocks are doing. They have a
business center out there. They'll pick you up at the airport,
hotel, arrange all the transportation. Pull into their parking lot.
They transport you right to the pavilion.''
</P>
<P>
   GolfWatch ``oases'' scattered around the course offer gourmet
snacks, TV, comfortable chairs and a full bar. The Open, which
offered GolfWatch for the first time last year, made 1,000
GolfWatch passes available this year.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, 75 percent of them were sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of corporations buy them to entertain the really top
clients,'' McGarey said.
</P>
<P>
   Stein, the Buick sales manager, is looking forward to his fourth
trip to the Open this year. He expects to run into people he met on
previous visits, and to enjoy the relaxed atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   He said there's a lot of talk about some of the perks given to
big-money golf fans, some of it overdone. He thinks it's a
``relaxed country club or polo club atmosphere'' but not knockout
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a medium to high-end grade of food,'' he said. ``From a
social standpoint I would give it a 10. You're right there. You see
the players coming by.''

LILLY AND 3 RIVALS TO SETTLE PROZAC SUIT FOR $4 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., Canada, Switzerland)  (sw) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Preserving the sales of its top brand, Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. announced
on Monday that it had reached a $4 million settlement with three
drug companies that were vying to make a generic version of Prozac,
the company's popular antidepressant.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement comes as Lilly's patent infringement lawsuit
against Barr Laboratories; Geneva Pharmaceuticals, a unit of
Novartis AG, and the Canadian drug maker Apotex Inc. was scheduled
to begin on Monday in U.S. District Court in Indianapolis. Barr,
with Apotex as a joint-venture partner, and Geneva ignited a
three-year court scuffle with Lilly when they filed applications
with the Food and Drug Administration to make a generic form of
Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   By analyst and investor accounts, Lilly, which is based in
Indianapolis, was the big winner in the settlement. The agreement
virtually guarantees that Prozac will not become generic before
December 2003, when the last of its patents expires, enabling Lilly
to pocket the drug's $2.8 billion in annual revenue until that
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened is that Lilly made out like a bandit,'' said
Neil Sweig, an analyst with Southeast Research Partners. ``In the
last two weeks, as the case approached trial, we thought it was 80
percent sure that Lilly would keep Prozac under patent until
December 2003. Now, we're 95 percent sure. The generic-drug
companies just lost this entire battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors apparently agreed. Shares of Lilly soared $6 on
Monday, or 7.5 percent, to $86.25. Shares of Barr, which hit a
52-week high last month at $49.0625, fell $2.75, or 6.3 percent, to
$40.875.
</P>
<P>
   Though Lilly executives were pleased with the settlement, the
company's battle with Barr is not over. Last week, Chief Judge
Sarah Evans Barker of U.S. District Court threw out what analysts
had thought were Barr's two chief complaints _ that Lilly held two
patents on the same drug and that the company had not disclosed the
best way to make the compound.
</P>
<P>
   With the settlement, Barr can immediately appeal the decisions
on those two claims, thus keeping its case against Lilly alive.
Analysts said on Monday that Barr's desire to appeal those claims
kept the settlement amount at only $4 million, about what Lilly
would have paid to try the case, instead of a larger sum that would
have prevented any further court action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were running out of time on the patent that expired in
2001,'' said Bruce L. Downey, chief executive of Barr Laboratories,
in Pomona, N.Y. ``If we had litigated the case, we would have not
gotten a decision until April or May. This way, we can proceed with
the appeals, which is where I have believed this issue would be
decided anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Barr has another day in court, the settlement is a
victory for Sidney Taurel, Lilly's chief executive. It is common
for the bosses of large pharmaceutical companies to face patent
expirations, which inevitably drain sales, but Taurel appears to
have handled Prozac's demise with finesse.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, several analysts had publicly chided Taurel as being
shortsighted regarding Prozac's patent expiration, but he now has
several remedies to deploy.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly agreed last month to buy rights to the improved version of
Prozac made by Sepracor Inc.; that compound is patented until 2015.
On Monday, Taurel named several drugs under development _ including
a combination of Prozac and Zyprexa, Lilly's antipsychotic drug _
that would lift the company's revenue once Prozac became a generic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have said all along that we have a multipronged approach to
the Prozac expiration,'' Taurel said. ``The settlement only
vindicates our position, but we plan to capitalize on our expertise
with depression.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Taurel has not heard the last from Downey, who spent 20
years as a trial lawyer before joining Barr. Determined to get a
cut of Prozac's revenues, Downey said last week that he was
studying the patent on Sepracor's improved Prozac compound for a
possible challenge in court.
</P>
<P>
   Taurel does not appear to be worried. ``We think that Sepracor's
patent on the molecule is strong,'' he said. ``If it wasn't, we
would have challenged it ourselves.''

PATTERSON ROUGING IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ For a second-round pick, Ruben
Patterson certainly has made an impression on the Lakers. Actually,
several of them.
</P>
<P>
   Check Shaquille O'Neal's derriere. And Rick Fox's tongue. And
varying black-and-blue parts of Tyronn Lue, Corie Blount and Kobe
Bryant. Patterson's left a mark on them all during the brief
training camp that ends today.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive specialist from Cincinnati, dubbed ``Wild Thing
II'' by teammates, personifies a new Lakers mentality that is
aggressive and physical, and in Patterson's case, bordering at
times on recklessness.
</P>
<P>
   He's knocked almost everyone over at some point in the last few
days, including a bump that sent the 7-foot-1, 330-pound O'Neal to
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   And the Lakers, minus an occasional wince, love it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like his aggressiveness,'' coach Del Harris said, ``and all
we're saying to any of our people is when you get bumped pretty
good, just thank the guy, because he's getting us ready for real
NBA action. So long as the hits are not cheap shots or something,
any rough, tough play is just gonna make us better.''
</P>
<P>
   But Patterson has already hurt himself once and always appears
on the verge of decapitating someone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about it,'' said Harris, who called Patterson
``a bit of a meat grinder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather have it that way than everybody out there playing
softball,'' he said. ``We don't want to play softball anymore.
We've spent five years trying to get guys to be a little tougher,
so I'm not gonna ask somebody to quit being tough.''
</P>
<P>
   A 6-foot-6, 227-pound small forward, Patterson is trying to find
a place on a talented and deep roster. His one-year contract is
guaranteed, but he has no guarantee of making the 12-man roster
when the Lakers cut down from 14 after the second week of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   But Patterson said he's just playing his game, not trying to
sell himself to the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to play physical. Coming from Cincinnati, with (coach)
Bob Huggins, you don't play physical, play hard, you're not going
to play for him. So that's what I like.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson and Bryant's jostling and elbowing Sunday night led to
a brief, nose-to-nose jawing session that left both men clearly
teed off. Bryant downplayed the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never nothing personal, it's just competition,'' he
said. ``The more he does that (play aggressively), the better he's
gonna get at it. He can play against me and do that all practice if
he wants. That's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said Patterson's style is needed to prepare the Lakers for
opponents but added, ``I just hope he doesn't get hurt or someone
else doesn't get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Definite maybe: Harris' proposal to rotate Fox, Bryant and
Eddie Jones as starters at shooting guard and small forward was not
enthusiastically embraced by the incumbent starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he feels that's what's best for us, then it's something I'd
work with. . . . Maybe that's the best way to solve somewhat of a
dilemma, I guess,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones seemed put off by the concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't even thought about it,'' he said. ``I don't know,
give me a day to think about it. . . . I gotta see how I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Good reviews: Overall, Harris is immensely pleased with the
Lakers' work in camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the best attitude among our practices here the five
years I've been in Los Angeles, for sure,'' he said. ``The guys are
all talking to one another and urging one another on better. . . .
We haven't had anybody short-cutting it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Tipping off: The Lakers held a free scrimmage at UC Santa
Barbara's Thunderdome on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   They'll hold another free scrimmage Wednesday at the Forum. All
tickets have been distributed. The Lakers finally play someone else
Friday and Saturday _ a pair of exhibition games against the
Clippers.

QUAKE KILLS AT LEAST 235 IN COLOMBIA 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ An earthquake rocked the mountainous
coffee-growing region of western Colombia on Monday, killing more
than 200 people and causing entire neighborhoods to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary figures from the Colombian government listed 235
people dead and 650 ``gravely injured.'' However, those figures
were expected to rise as rescue workers searched for survivors and
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The earthquake, with a preliminary magnitude of 6.0, struck at
1:20 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time and was followed by several powerful
aftershocks.
</P>
<P>
   Television footage from Armenia and Pereira, two of the cities
hardest hit by the quake, showed Red Cross workers using crowbars
and hammers to dig for trapped victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge catastrophe in our city. Wherever you go, there
are fallen buildings,'' said Alvaro Patino, the mayor of Armenia,
located 110 miles west of the capital city of Bogota. ``We need all
the help that can be sent, because there is chaos at this moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Caracol Television of Bogota reported that as many as 120 people
were killed in Armenia. The city's main prison was destroyed and
all of its prisoners had escaped, Caracol said.
</P>
<P>
   The quake's epicenter was located just 15 miles west of Armenia
in Valle del Cauca state. The temblor also damaged towns and
hamlets in neighboring Quindio, Tolima, and Risaralda states _ home
to much of Colombia's vital coffee industry.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers worked late into the night, carrying bleeding
survivors and limp bodies on their backs. Rescue crews made an
urgent call for blood, medicine, trauma surgeons, and heavy
equipment to remove rubble and aid in the search for victims.
</P>
<P>
   An extra edition published Monday night by the Bogota daily El
Tiempo carried the headline: ``Earthquake: Armenia
semi-destroyed.'' Parts of the cities of Calarca and Cajamarca were
also devastated.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian President Andres Pastrana on Monday postponed a trip
to Europe to fly to the disaster zone along with several ministers
and National Police Chief Rosso Jose Serrano. Army brigades were
mobilized to help streams of refugees whose homes were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   In Pereira, cars were crushed by collapsed houses. Distraught
family members wandered through the wreckage, calling out for
missing loved ones. Buildings looked as through they had exploded,
and streets were filled with bricks and glass. The air was thick
with smoke from fires that broke out downtown.
</P>
<P>
   In the nearby town of Ulloa, nearly every building was
destroyed, according to a spokesman for the Solidarity Network, a
government emergency organization. Landslides buried vehicles and
blocked highways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Colombian government is doing all it can,'' said Vice
President Gustavo Bell.
</P>
<P>
   But government services appeared to be overwhelmed. Hospitals in
the region were overflowing with victims. Health workers called for
volunteer doctors from Bogota, Medellin and Cali. They also
requested donations of clothing, cots, tarps, drinking water and
electric generators.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent looting, police cordoned off the centers of Pereira
and Armenia, and declared a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew as well as a
ban on sales of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Eugenio Garzon of the National Civil Defense network in
Bogota warned that damaged buildings could collapse and cause more
deaths. He added that the government was sending special cameras
and heat-seeking equipment to find trapped victims.
</P>
<P>
   First lady Nohra Pastrana called for international help but
added: ``As Colombians, we must be the first to demonstrate
solidarity with our country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to ask all of our friends to unite in the face of
this disaster,'' she said.

PATTERSON ROUGHING IT
</HEADLINE>
 SPELLING IN HEAD (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD Beck  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ For a second-round pick, Ruben Patterson
certainly has made an impression on the Lakers. Actually, several
of them.
</P>
<P>
   Check Shaquille O'Neal's derriere. And Rick Fox's tongue. And
varying black-and-blue parts of Tyronn Lue, Corie Blount and Kobe
Bryant. Patterson's left a mark on them all during the brief
training camp that ends today.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive specialist from Cincinnati, dubbed ``Wild Thing
II'' by teammates, personifies a new Lakers mentality that is
aggressive and physical, and in Patterson's case, bordering at
times on recklessness.
</P>
<P>
   He's knocked almost everyone over at some point in the last few
days, including a bump that sent the 7-foot-1, 330-pound O'Neal to
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   And the Lakers, minus an occasional wince, love it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like his aggressiveness,'' coach Del Harris said, ``and all
we're saying to any of our people is when you get bumped pretty
good, just thank the guy, because he's getting us ready for real
NBA action. So long as the hits are not cheap shots or something,
any rough, tough play is just gonna make us better.''
</P>
<P>
   But Patterson has already hurt himself once and always appears
on the verge of decapitating someone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about it,'' said Harris, who called Patterson
``a bit of a meat grinder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather have it that way than everybody out there playing
softball,'' he said. ``We don't want to play softball anymore.
We've spent five years trying to get guys to be a little tougher,
so I'm not gonna ask somebody to quit being tough.''
</P>
<P>
   A 6-foot-6, 227-pound small forward, Patterson is trying to find
a place on a talented and deep roster. His one-year contract is
guaranteed, but he has no guarantee of making the 12-man roster
when the Lakers cut down from 14 after the second week of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   But Patterson said he's just playing his game, not trying to
sell himself to the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to play physical. Coming from Cincinnati, with (coach)
Bob Huggins, you don't play physical, play hard, you're not going
to play for him. So that's what I like.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson and Bryant's jostling and elbowing Sunday night led to
a brief, nose-to-nose jawing session that left both men clearly
teed off. Bryant downplayed the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never nothing personal, it's just competition,'' he
said. ``The more he does that (play aggressively), the better he's
gonna get at it. He can play against me and do that all practice if
he wants. That's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said Patterson's style is needed to prepare the Lakers for
opponents but added, ``I just hope he doesn't get hurt or someone
else doesn't get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Definite maybe: Harris' proposal to rotate Fox, Bryant and
Eddie Jones as starters at shooting guard and small forward was not
enthusiastically embraced by the incumbent starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he feels that's what's best for us, then it's something I'd
work with. . . . Maybe that's the best way to solve somewhat of a
dilemma, I guess,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones seemed put off by the concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't even thought about it,'' he said. ``I don't know,
give me a day to think about it. . . . I gotta see how I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Good reviews: Overall, Harris is immensely pleased with the
Lakers' work in camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the best attitude among our practices here the five
years I've been in Los Angeles, for sure,'' he said. ``The guys are
all talking to one another and urging one another on better. . . .
We haven't had anybody short-cutting it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Tipping off: The Lakers held a free scrimmage at UC Santa
Barbara's Thunderdome on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   They'll hold another free scrimmage Wednesday at the Forum. All
tickets have been distributed. The Lakers finally play someone else
Friday and Saturday _ a pair of exhibition games against the
Clippers.

   INTEL SCRAPS ID PLAN OVER PRIVACY CONCERN
</P>
<P>
   Intel, the dominant maker of computer chips, reversed a plan to
activate an identifying signature in its next generation of
products, capitulating to protests that the technology would
compromise user privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it would modify the identification system in
the Pentium III chips so that it was disabled unless the computer
user voluntarily turned it on. Privacy groups had said they feared
the ID system would mark a further erosion of anonymity on the
Internet and allow marketers to collect detailed profiles of
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   SWISS BANK IN BIG PULLBACK
</P>
<P>
   Still recovering from its disastrous investment in derivatives
last year, UBS of Switzerland, one of the world's largest banks,
announced a broad retreat from some of its riskier areas of lending
and investment banking. UBS said it would sharply reduce its
international lending, as well as investment in distressed loans,
lease financing, commodities trading and other niches.
</P>
<P>
   CITIGROUP OPERATING PROFIT FALLS
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, still struggling to revive its corporate banking
business, said its fourth-quarter operating earnings plunged 27
percent, although the weak performance was bolstered by a strong
showing from the consumer banking operation and exceeded
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ELI LILLY SETTLES PATENT CASE
</P>
<P>
   Preserving the sales of its top brand, Eli Lilly announced that
it had reached a $4 million settlement with three drug companies
that were vying to make a generic version of Prozac, the company's
popular antidepressant. By analyst and investor accounts, Lilly was
the big winner in the settlement. Its shares soared $6, or 7.5
percent, to $86.25.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATS CHALLENGE PLAN
</P>
<P>
   The Republican proposal to cut income taxes by 10 percent would
mean many middle class families will get only part of the tax break
and taxes would rise on large middle income families by as much as
14 percent, House Democrats are contending.
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS END WITH MODERATE GAINS
</P>
<P>
   After meandering through much of the day, stocks closed mostly
higher, lifting major averages back into plus territory for the
year. The Nasdaq composite index finished with a gain of 30.43
points, or 1.3 percent, at 2,369.31. The Dow Jones industrial
average rose 82.65 points, or nine-tenths of a percent, to
9,203.32. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index increased 8.79
points, to 1,233.98.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission approved a rule extending
to 15 minutes the period market makers must post prices for shares
of initial offerings on the Nasdaq stock market before those shares
begin to trade.

<P>
   MICROSOFT CITES `PATENT TERRORISM'
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's lead lawyer in the Microsoft antitrust
case clashed with the company's highest-ranking witness as the
Government contended that the software giant had used its market
power as ``a club'' in its dealings with Apple Computer, while the
executive countered that his company was responding to a threat of
``patent terrorism.''

   MAYOR IN CHINA REASSURES INVESTORS

   In an effort to ease international concern about the health of

   ANDREAS STEPS DOWN AT ARCHER

   Dwayne Andreas, 80, who directed the transformation of Archer
Daniels Midland from a modest regional grain processor to a global

more than a quarter of a century at the helm. Andreas was succeeded
by his nephew in a succession widely expected by Wall Street.

ANDREAS STEPS DOWN AS ADM CHAIRMAN; NEPHEW SUCCEEDS HIM
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (nk) 
 By KURT EICHENWALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dwayne O. Andreas, who directed the transformation of Archer
Daniels Midland Co. from a modest regional grain processor to a
global agribusiness giant, stepped down as chairman of the company
Monday after more than a quarter of a century at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   Andreas, who will remain tied to the company as chairman
emeritus and a member of the board, was succeeded by his nephew, G.
Allen Andreas, who has served as chief executive of the company for
almost two years.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts had widely expected the succession, a fact
that in itself may be the final testament to the influence retained
by Dwayne Andreas, long one of the most powerful and politically
connected executives in America.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last four years, Andreas saw his hopes of turning the
corporate reins over to his son Michael shatter amid a price-fixing
scandal. That scandal, which resulted in the conviction of Michael
and two other executives on federal antitrust charges, raised
questions among some institutional shareholders about the future
role of the Andreas family in the company.
</P>
<P>
   But Andreas, who is 80, threw his influence behind his nephew, a
respected executive who had won plaudits from his efforts to build
ADM's business in Europe. By 1997, with the approval of company
directors, Dwayne Andreas turned the job of chief executive over to
Allen, telling friends that he intended to continue as chairman for
a year or two.
</P>
<P>
   Since that time, analysts said, Dwayne Andreas has been taking
less and less of a role in the daily operations of the company,
ceding those duties to his nephew. In essence, these analysts said,
Monday's announcement merely formalizes the role established in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it a change in form, but not substance,'' said Leonard
Teitelbaum, a managing director and analyst with Merrill Lynch &AMP;
Co.
</P>
<P>
   With his new duties, Andreas will continue exerting an enormous
level of influence at the company. ``Anybody who thinks that Dwayne
Andreas is going to try out for captain of his shuffleboard team is
sadly mistaken,'' Teitelbaum said. ``He is too big an influence in
worldwide agriculture.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Allen Andreas said that he expects to continue
working closely with his uncle. ``It's a great opportunity for both
of us,'' he said. ``He and I have been close associates, and I
expect to continue to use his wise advice and counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   Dwayne Andreas' decision to steo down crystallized over the
Christmas holidays, according to friends and directors. ``He just
decided it was time,'' said Robert Strauss, an ADM director and
former chairman of the Democratic Party. ``I don't think he had to
wrestle with it. He just woke up one day and it felt like the right
thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   According to participants in Monday's board meeting, the votes
to accept the resignation and name a new chairman were followed by
several directors offering plaudits to Dwayne Andreas. Strauss
praised him for his ability to move so easily through different
worlds _ agricultural, political and international. Andrew Young,
the former United Nations Representative, told of Andreas'
anonymous contributions to rebuild black churches when they were
being burned down.
</P>
<P>
   Directors and analysts said that the transfer of power to a new
generation should be particularly important now, as falling margins
are creating new challenges for agriculture companies. ``Allen is
more youthful,'' Webb said in an interview, ``And that vigor is a
positive thing for us right now with all the dynamics that are
happening in the agricultural industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Dwayne Andreas, who a company spokeswoman said was not available
for comment, has been part of the industry since childhood. The son
of Mennonite farmers, he helped build a family feed company, and
later joined Cargill Inc. as an executive. Long before
globalization became the mantra of corporate America, he pushed
agricultural companies to seek new markets overseas _ indeed, a
dispute about his desire to seek new business in the then Soviet
Union contributed to his departure from Cargill.
</P>
<P>
   He joined ADM in 1965, and within five years, was named chairman
and chief executive. Over the decades that followed, Andreas built
the company's financial fortunes and political influence. Andreas
considered courting politicians as part of his job. With an ease
that bred envy among other corporations, Andreas helped navigate
ADM between the Republicans and Democrats while helping to form
this country's agricultural policies.
</P>
<P>
   Renowned for generosity in political contributions, the company,
Andreas and his family forged ties with politicians from Hubert
Humphrey to Ronald Reagan, and from Bill Clinton to Newt Gingrich.
In the 1972 campaign, it was $25,000 contributed to the Nixon
campaign from Dwayne Andreas that ended up in the bank account of a
Watergate burglar.
</P>
<P>
   The price-fixing scandal arose in 1995, when federal agents
raided the company's headquarters in Decatur, Ill. It soon emerged
that a senior executive, Mark Whitacre, had been working as an
informant for the government, secretly taping price-fixing
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the company admitted fixing prices for two commodities,
and agreed to pay a record $100 million fine.

BRADLEY GETS INTO GROOVE OF THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey took his
first icy steps on the long march toward the Democratic
presidential nomination Monday, trudging for the first time through
the winter snow of New Hampshire, as political custom demands in
the state that holds the first primary, and throwing around
basketballs and thoughtful thoughts, as befits a New York Knicks
Hall of Famer and a Rhodes scholar.
</P>
<P>
   He sank his first jumper at a carefully staged photo opportunity
in a Manchester gym. He said in his first news conference that he
would run on ideas, not against anybody. And he insisted from the
moment that he first hit the hustings that he could win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel disadvantaged at all,'' Bradley said, brushing
aside questions about whether he could ever overcome the lead in
the polls and fund raising that Vice President Al Gore holds over
other Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main focuses, Bradley said, would be the needs of
Americans who have not fully shared in the American dream. Time and
again he cited education as a key to obtaining that larger share,
telling young basketball players at a youth club in Concord that
education really never ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not practicing,'' he said, ``somebody somewhere is
practicing. So all things being equal, when it comes to skill
between that guy and you, that guy is going to win. So practice is
what you've got to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he picked up a ball and let fly.
</P>
<P>
   Swish! But the next several shots missed entirely or fell off
the rim until he found the old groove once again.
</P>
<P>
   Many political professionals say that what Bradley has to do in
the new game he is playing is position himself solidly as the No. 2
Democrat, the heir apparent Democrat, should Gore falter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore's been in the state a lot longer and has a considerable
head start, so I don't know where Bradley's candidacy is going to
go,'' said Wilfred Sanders, a Hampton lawyer who has been involved
at the top in Democratic politics in New Hampshire for going on 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, a 55-year-old political moderate who retired from the
Senate two years ago after serving 18 years, officially jumped into
the contest several weeks ago. But Monday was his first real day
out on the campaign trail. And if he drew no real crowds, he
nevertheless seemed comfortable with his candidacy and appeared to
enjoy himself thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   What was his biggest concern about running for president?
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I fear?'' Bradley began, mulling. ``Well, not being
able to reach that part of myself that you can convey to Americans.
But I think I can do it.''

WHITE HOUSE SEES NEED FOR MORE BASE CLOSINGS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH BECKER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Congress increasingly vocal about improving
military readiness, the Clinton administration sees an opportunity
this year to convince lawmakers that closing more bases is critical
to that effort, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Defense Secretary William Cohen plans to ask for
two new rounds of base closings as part of the administration's
overall request for more military spending, Pentagon officials
said. In a speech before the Illinois Legislature, Cohen is
expected to argue that President Clinton's proposal for $12 billion
in new military spending would be undercut without closing bases
that drain the Defense Department's resources.
</P>
<P>
   Those arguments will have a more sympathetic hearing in Congress
where the new chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Sen. John
Warner, is discussing with the department a new base closure bill
introduced in the Senate last week, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Warner, R-Va., cast the deciding vote that killed a
similar measure. Since then two reports issued by the General
Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, have answered
one of the chief Congressional complaints. The accounting office
agreed with the Pentagon that base closings are saving billions of
dollars. The department says the closings eventually provide some
$2 billion to $3 billion in savings each year.
</P>
<P>
   At least as important for the lawmakers, the accounting office
reports confirmed that the communities where bases were closed had
recovered most of the lost jobs within two years. A report last
month said that in more than half of those communities, incomes
grew faster than the national average.
</P>
<P>
   ``The GAO report was a very important milestone in this saga,''
said Robert Bell, senior director of defense programs at the
National Security Council. ``It confirmed that the savings are
greater and the upfront costs are less.''
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon official who has spoken with both Republican and
Democratic leaders in Congress said he was ``encouraged by the
general tenor of our conversations.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the administration believes that in this nonelection
year, Congress is more likely to approve base closings that will
not take effect until 2001 and 2005, when a new president is in
office.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress is also demanding insurances that the next
president does not turn base closings into a political issue, as
many say Clinton did in 1996 by trying to save jobs at two bases
scheduled to be closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Base closures worked until President Clinton came in,'' said
Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa. ``We can't have a process that was
politicized as it was in 1995 and 1996.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Weldon says he is willing to consider more base
closings, if only because he knows that Clinton will be unable to
affect the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not against base closings, and I'm not against additional
closures,'' Weldon said. ``It's a debate that has to take place.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., with Sens. Charles S. Robb
of Virginia and Carl Levin of Michigan, both Democrats, introduced
legislation for new base closings that is being viewed as a
starting point for this year's debate.
</P>
<P>
   In September, McCain criticized the Joint Chiefs of Staff for
failing to give sufficient warning about budget shortcomings in the
armed forces, especially on issues involving the military's
readiness to respond to crises. When offering the base closure bill
last week, the senator referred to those warnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last four months, we've heard of the dire situation
of our military forces: plunging readiness, modernization programs
that are decades behind schedule,'' he said. ``Every dollar we
spend on bases we do not need is a dollar we cannot spend on
training our troops.''
</P>
<P>
   With Republicans vying with the Administration over how much
additional money to give the Pentagon, the chances for persuading
Congress to approve new base closings has improved, Congressional
aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year Congress has a fresh start and everyone realizes the
budget problem is for real,'' said Michael O'Hanlon, a defense
expert at the Brookings Institute. ``When the Joint Chiefs asked
for a $150 billion increase over six years, Congress realized that
the problem was for real and that there is no serious argument
against closing more bases.''

CATHOLIC GROUP URGES POPE TO SUPPORT MINISTRY OF WOMEN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CECILE S. HOLMES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Huddling together against the cold in front of the
Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis, 400 Catholic men and women called
Monday for the church of old Rome to fully support the ministry of
women.
</P>
<P>
   In what might be described as a liberal Catholic revival, those
gathered sang and prayed at a candlelight vigil sponsored by a
local group calling itself Catholic Women for Justice.
</P>
<P>
   The vigil took place just a few feet in front of the yellow and
white Vatican flags hanging outside the cathedral to welcome Pope
John Paul II to St. Louis. The pope is scheduled to arrive from
Mexico at 1 p.m. CST Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a purple T-shirt with the slogan, ``priestly people come
in both sexes,'' vigil participant Michael Bartz said, ``We are
here to ask for a conversion of the church.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the vigil earlier had called for the ``full
participation'' of women in the Catholic Church, including
ordaining them as priests, an office for centuries held only by
celibate males.
</P>
<P>
   The pope will speak at a prayer service at the cathedral later
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Vigil participants had been invited to wear purple to symbolize
``mourning the church's unrepented sin of sexism and hope for the
church as a partnership of equals,'' organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   The vigil grew out of informal conversations among a small group
of Catholic women in the Archdiocese of St. Louis. The local group
includes nuns and laywomen of various ages. All are active
Catholics with a history of church involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic Women for Justice organized in early November upon
learning that the pontiff planned a 30-hour stop in this Midwestern
city after his five-day visit to Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   The women's vigil feeds into a rising stream of progressive
Catholic disagreement with John Paul's teachings opposing birth
control, women's ordination and other liberal views.
</P>
<P>
   That disagreement is especially strong in Western Europe and the
United States. National surveys indicate many U.S. Catholics
support ordaining women and married men as priests, despite the
rising voice and activism of Catholic traditionalists who support
the pope's views.
</P>
<P>
   The women involved in the vigil come from ``the heart of the
church'' and embrace most Catholic teachings, said Cathy Hartrich,
a vigil organizer.
</P>
<P>
   But the women disagree with papal encyclicals forbidding dissent
and claiming infallibility on the teaching that women must be
excluded from the priesthood, Hartrich said.
</P>
<P>
   The 46-year-old mother of three is active in a local church. She
teaches ethics, social justice and theology at an all-girl Catholic
high school. She once lived in a lay Catholic community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we should be able to discuss this,'' Hartrich said,
urging that the church be ``an adult faith community'' where women
are regarded as ``full participants as opposed to being children
listening to a patriarchal kind of model.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing the vigil as a witness, not a protest, organizers
said they yearn to call attention to the thousands of women who
love the church and work for it, but are barred from important
leadership roles, including the priesthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a protest. It's not a demonstration. It's a prayer
service,'' said Sister Louise Lears, another organizer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope's coming here, as someone who is wanting to offer
faith to people, is a wonderful thing,'' said Sharon McMullen
Orlet. ``But it's a time when it reminds us that women's gifts are
still not being used in the church. The justice that he speaks of
needs to begin at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Orlet, 49 and a pastoral counselor, is married and the mother of
a young daughter. She felt called to the priesthood but had to earn
her master of divinity degree from a Protestant seminary.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, 82 percent of the 26,000 lay people, nuns and monks
serving the church as parish ministers were female, vigil
organizers said, but they cannot serve as official church pastors,
lead a diocese or help elect the pope.
</P>
<P>
   Church posts held by parish ministers include overseeing
religious education, coordinating worship and serving as parish
administrators in churches without a priest.

SADIE DELANY, WITNESS TO CENTURY, DIES AT 109 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RICHARD SEVERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sarah (Sadie) Delany, the last of the storied Delany sisters,
died peacefully in her sleep at the age of 109 Monday at her home
in Mount Vernon, N.Y., spokesmen for her family said.
</P>
<P>
   She was the oldest survivor of one of America's most remarkable
families, the daughter of a man who had been born a slave, and the
first colored woman _ the term she preferred _ ever permitted to
teach home economics in white New York City schools.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Delany and her younger sister, Dr. A. Elizabeth (Bessie)
Delany, were always celebrated in Harlem, where they lived and
flourished from 1916 to 1957, after leaving their native Raleigh,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Delany, who received her doctorate in dental surgery from
Columbia in 1923, was the second black woman licensed to practice
dentistry in New York State. She had an office in Harlem and was
known to thousands of people only as ``Dr. Bessie.'' She charged $2
for a cleaning and $5 for a silver filling and never raised her
rates in 27 years of practice.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters gained widespread fame after the publication in 1993
of a memoir they called ``Having Our Say; The Delany Sisters' First
100 Years.'' They wrote it with Amy Hill Hearth as an oral history
from their early days in the Jim Crow South to their arrival in New
York City during the Harlem Renaissance to their life in a white
suburb.
</P>
<P>
   The book, now part of curriculums at hundreds of colleges and
high schools, was on The New York Times hardcover best-seller list
for 28 weeks and on the paperback list for 77 weeks. They followed
it in 1995 with ``The Delany Sisters' Book of Everyday Wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, ``Having Our Say'' was adapted by Emily Mann into a
Broadway play that was nominated for three Tony awards. The play
followed the sisters in virtually nonstop conversation while they
prepared an annual meal celebrating their father's birthday in the
home they owned on a dead end street in Mount Vernon, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters lived in that house from 1957 to 1995, and Miss
Delany remained there after Dr. Delany died in 1995 at 104. ``She
is my right arm,'' Miss Delany had told an interviewer shortly
before her sister's death. ``If she were to die first, I'm not sure
I would want to go on living because the reason I am living is to
keep her living.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sadie, as her friends called her, kept going, just as the
Delany sisters always had. Her last book, with Ms. Hearth, ``On My
Own at 107: Reflections on a Life Without Bessie,'' appeared in May
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters liked to say that Dr. Bessie was the acerbic one,
who was convinced it was her duty to tell people the truth, whether
it concerned race relations or their molars. Sadie would say to
her, ``Bessie, don't you realize that people don't want to hear the
truth?''
</P>
<P>
   If Dr. Bessie was the vinegar, then Miss Sadie was the molasses,
with an uncommon talent for getting along and for being as sweet as
the candy she used to make for extra money as a young teacher.
</P>
<P>
   The Delanys were a mix of hard-working African, white and
American Indian stock, a family that was rich in everything but
money, reserved, aristocratic and irrepressible even as they
suffered through segregation.
</P>
<P>
   Sadie Delany always thought of herself as a ``colored woman''
or, if one insisted on labels, a Negro. She never saw herself as
black _ that did not describe her color, she used to say _ nor did
she care for the term African-American.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Beard Delany, their gentle, scholarly father, was born
into slavery in 1858. The Delanys were house slaves of a St. Marys,
Ga., family named Mock, who taught them to read and write. Henry
Delany later attended St. Augustine's School in Raleigh and became
the first Negro bishop of the Episcopal Church.
</P>
<P>
   He met his future wife, Nanny James Logan, at St. Augustine's.
Sarah Louise Delany, their second child, was born Sept. 19, 1889,
at an aunt's home in Lynch's Station, Va. She grew up with two
sisters and six brothers on the campus of St. Augustine's, where
their father was vice principal.
</P>
<P>
   Happy though they might have been, the South around them was
not. The former Confederate states were still reacting to the loss
of the war nearly 50 years before. The sisters took different
approaches to the Jim Crow laws passed across the south around
1914. In ``Having Our Say,'' Sadie Delany wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you how I handled white people. There was a shoe
store in Raleigh called Heller's. The owner was a Jewish man, very
nice. If you were colored, you had to go in the back to try on
shoes, and white people sat in front. It wasn't Heller's fault;
this was the Jim Crow law. I would go in there and say, `Good
morning, Heller, I would like to try on those shoes in the window.'
And I would say, `Where, Heller?' And he would gesture to the back
and say, `Back there.' And I would say, `Back (italics)where?'(end
italics) Well, I'd just worry that man to death.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he'd say, `Just sit anywhere, Miss Delany!' And so I
would sit myself down in the white section, and smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Bessie thinks that I shouldn't play dumb like that,'' she
recalled ``But I don't care. I got to sit in the white section.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadie Delany liked to say that when she got her master's degree
in education from Columbia in 1925, a white teacher there observed,
``That Sarah Delany. You tell her to do something, she smiles at
you, and then she just turns around and does what she wants
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   In this, Miss Delany said, she was ``just like Papa.''
</P>
<P>
   She graduated from St. Augustine's in 1910. Her first job was
working for the black school system in Wake County, N.C., teaching
subjects like sanitation, how to can food and how to care for
newborn infants.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, she remembered her students: ``They looked up to me
and I showed them it was possible to live a better life, despite
what white people were trying to do to us.'' She proudly recalled
driving Booker T. Washington around when he visited.
</P>
<P>
   The Delany sisters first saw New York City in 1915, on a visit
with their mother. Their father agreed to let them move to New York
to attend college. Sadie Delany moved first, in 1916, and Bessie
came along a year later. It was one of the rare times when the
sisters were separated.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, nine of the 10 Delany children moved to New York,
and all received college educations. Only Lemuel, the oldest,
stayed in the South. The sisters are survived by 13 nieces and
nephews.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Sadie, Bessie, Julia, Hubert and Lucius Delany
lived together at 2505 Seventh Avenue and West 145th Street in
Harlem, each paying a $9 share of the monthly rent. Their neighbors
complained.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought we were running a fast house!'' the two sisters
recalled. ``We don't know why it didn't occur to them that we were
brothers and sisters, except that they must have had unclear minds.
So we had a little talk with the super and straightened out the
whole mess.''
</P>
<P>
   The Delanys had quite a few such talks over the years with
people who did not understand them, and they always straightened
out the mess.
</P>
<P>
   While she was teaching at Public School 119, Sadie Delany found
she could not support herself on the salary, so she started baking
cakes and selling them for a nickel a slice to other teachers. She
also made lemon and cinnamon lollipops, which she sold for a penny
a piece.
</P>
<P>
   People liked her cakes and candies so much that she rented a
loft on 121st Street in the late 1920s and made homemade chocolate
fondant, a soft, creamy affair. Called ``Delany's Delights,'' it
was soon sold all over New York, including Abraham &AMP; Straus, at $2
a pound.
</P>
<P>
   She closed her business down after the 1929 stock market crash.
``People had no money for chocolate fondant, that's for sure,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   After years of teaching at predominantly black grade schools,
Miss Delany wanted to teach high-school level domestic science, as
home economics was then called. She had a master's from Columbia,
after all. No Negro had ever before done that. She applied for a
job, and received a letter from the Board of Education asking to
meet her.
</P>
<P>
   She knew that if the board members saw her, they would not hire
her. So she skipped the appointment, sent a polite letter
explaining there had been a ``mixup,'' and just showed up at the
all-white Theodore Roosevelt High School on the first day of class.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just about died when they saw me,'' she recalled. ``A
colored woman!''
</P>
<P>
   She kept the job and spent the rest of her career teaching at
excellent high schools before retiring in 1960. Among them were
Girls' High School in Brooklyn, Evander Childs High School in the
Bronx and Washington Irving High School in New York City, where she
taught adults at night.
</P>
<P>
   It was lonely, she said. Some of her fellow teachers, who were
all white, were friendly, she said, ``but you couldn't count on any
of them being your real friend.''
</P>
<P>
   She told Ms. Hearth: ``New York was no piece of cake for a
colored person, but it was an improvement over the South, child.
But don't go thinking I don't love the South. I was born there, and
I expect to be buried there, right next to my Mama and Papa.
Raleigh will always be home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadie is molasses without even trying,'' her sister once said.
``She can sweet-talk the world, or play dumb, or whatever it takes
to get by without a fuss.''
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes the molasses could boil. The Board of Education
once sent her what she called a ``nasty'' letter. She had lived for
so long that the bean-counters had become convinced that she must
have died and that somebody else was cashing all those pension
checks. She was furious, but as usual straightened it all out.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of her life, Sadie Delany did not want anybody to
think that she and her sister were just a couple of old women
letting life slip by as they sat in their rocking chairs. ``Why, we
don't even own a rocking chair,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she woke up every morning at 6:30, smiled and said,
``Thank you, Lord, for another day.'' Then she would wake up
Bessie, a late sleeper, who would open her eyes and say, ``Oh Lord,
another day?''
</P>
<P>
   Then they would prepare their food, consuming as many as seven
different vegetables a day and lots of fresh fruit. They took
vitamin supplements, boiled their water despite assurances that
people could drink Mount Vernon water and live. They took up Yoga.
</P>
<P>
   They ate milk shakes for dinner, watched the nightly news on
public television, said their prayers (extra ones for the people
Bessie didn't like) and went to bed.
</P>
<P>
   They believed that their simple lives and good food contributed
to their longevity. Bessie said another reason was they ``never had
husbands to worry us to death.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sadie Delany said, ``Life is short, and it's up to you to
make it sweet.''

LINCOLN CENTER DROPS PLAN TO SELL JASPER JOHNS PAINTING
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Responding to widespread criticism, the board of
Lincoln Center voted Monday not to sell ``Numbers, 1964,'' the
monumental painting by Jasper Johns that had elicited offers of
more than $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   The board last month endorsed the idea of selling the painting,
which has hung in the lobby of the New York State Theater for 35
years, and it retained a lawyer to solicit further offers and work
out a sale strategy. But in a statement issued late Monday
afternoon, Lincoln Center announced that the board had abandoned
the idea because it was ``very concerned by the intensity of the
public reaction to the possible sale of `Numbers, 1964.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who had expressed pointed criticism to the board
were the directors of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum
of Modern Art; Philip Johnson, who was one of the architects of the
State Theater; one of the center's major donors and Johns himself.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant sentiment among the critics was that the Johns
work, a 9-foot-by-7-foot painting of Johns' signature gridded
numbers, was an integral part of the Lincoln Center complex, having
been created specifically for the east end of the theater's lobby,
and was a significant work of American art in its own right.
</P>
<P>
   Upon hearing that the center would retain his painting, which is
his only public artwork, Johns said, ``I'm just very pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Johnson, 92, said, ``I'm delighted and I feel much
better about Lincoln Center.'' Johnson had been hired last year to
analyze what work has to be done to upgrade the building, which is
home to the New York City Ballet and the New York City Opera.
</P>
<P>
   A sale would have been the first of a public artwork by Lincoln
Center, and the possibility set off a rare public contretemps among
members of the city's cultural leadership.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons the board had considered selling the painting
was to raise money to go toward its aging buildings on Lincoln
Center's campus. But on Monday, Beverly Sills, chairwoman of
Lincoln Center, and Nathan Leventhal, its president, said they
planned to raise money to improve the buildings and were
``confident we can do it without selling assets.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Before Monday's meeting, several people on the 51-member board
who had voted in December in favor of exploring a sale said they
were upset because they had been unaware of the first of two
letters written to Johns by Ms. Sills and Leventhal. The letter,
dated Oct. 7, said they had been approached by ``several
individuals,'' but that the board ``had no intention of considering
these offers or seeking others.''
</P>
<P>
   It went on to say, ``On the contrary, we have every intention of
continuing to display this wonderful painting for many generations
to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, the two wrote to the artist again, saying that
``because the pressure continued to increase from several would-be
buyers, we felt we had a fiduciary obligation to inform the full
Lincoln Center board of directors of these expressions of
interest.'' It said the board was ``virtually unanimous in
expressing the desire that we consider a possible sale.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sills said on Monday that the board had been informed of the
second letter to Johns, but about the first, she said, ``We simply
forgot.''
</P>
<P>
   Museum curators and art historians consider ``Numbers, 1964'' a
historically important work in part because it is the largest of
the artist's numbers motifs and the only one where each unit is on
a separate stretcher, fashioned from a material called Sculpmetal,
which was chosen by the artist for its durability.

UNIONS' MEMBERSHIP RISES, BUT THEIR SHARE OF WORK FORCE FALLS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (mk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced Monday that union
membership grew by 100,000 last year, after three years of decline,
causing the AFL-CIO to boast that its efforts to revive organized
labor were beginning to pay off.
</P>
<P>
   But the figures also reflected two unhappy trends for labor: The
number of union members in the private sector fell again last year,
and the percentage of union workers continued to fall, slipping to
13.9 percent from 14.1 percent as the 2.2 million increase in the
number of people working outpaced union expansion.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Washington, officials of the AFL-CIO
asserted that their renewed emphasis on organizing produced last
year's membership increase, after a decline of 159,000 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new data confirm that today's unions are on the right
track,'' said John Sweeney, the labor federation's president. ``Our
commitment and dedication to organizing, at all levels of the labor
movement, is beginning to bear fruit _but we still have a long way
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The labor bureau's household survey found that 16.2 million
Americans belong to unions, with membership growing fastest in
government and in the service sector. Union membership in the
public sector climbed to 37.5 percent from 37.2 percent, while
membership in the private sector declined to 9.5 percent from 9.7
percent, pulled down by the 126,000 drop in the number of unionized
workers in manufacturing
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Adams, the labor federation's organizing director, said
membership rose last year largely because of the 400,000 members he
estimated that unions had organized last year. The net growth
numbers were lower, labor experts said, because many unionized
companies downsized or closed plants.
</P>
<P>
   Adams noted that the the number of government-supervised union
elections rose 9 percent to 1,611 in the first half of 1998,
compared with 1,479 for the same period in 1997. And unions
triumphed in more of these elections, winning 51.7 percent in the
first half of 1998, up from 49.2 percent the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Chaison, an industrial relations professor at Clark
University in Worcester, Mass., said last year's 100,000 membership
increase was unimpressive. ``I don't think you can say in any one
year there's a turnaround,'' Chaison said. ``If they can point to a
five-year increase in the percentage of union members in the
private sector, that would be a real turnaround.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson, vice president of labor policy for the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, said the decline in private sector membership
underlined labor's weakness.
</P>
<P>
   But Adams said membership rose strongly in the public sector
while falling in the private sector because governments did not
fight unionization, while many corporations strongly opposed it.

NOT YOUR FATHER'S FEDORA

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stylish men _ those who favor long overcoats with
tailored suits _ are topping off their look this winter with
fedoras. These are not their fathers' hats, but cool new versions
with straight brims and narrow ribbon bands.
</P>
<P>
   The low-crown, small-brim style once favored by Frank Sinatra is
popular at Saks Fifth Avenue, said Dan McCampbell, the men's
fashion director. Borsalino's navy felt fedora is $200; Makins has
felt fedoras in gray or crushable brown, both $145.
</P>
<P>
   Barneys New York has classic narrow-brim felt fedoras from
England in black, brown or gray by Worth &AMP; Worth ($195) and by
James Lock ($185). For the taller or more adventurous man, there
are modern interpretations of the fedora with higher crowns and
wider brims by an American hat maker, Rod Keenan. These include a
brown fake pony skin with a leather band and a dashing brown or
cream felt with white whip-stitching, both $280.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the latest chapter in the most riveting
cliffhanger to transfix the fashion industry in some time, LVMH
Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton announced Monday that it has raised its
ownership of Gucci stock to 34.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although LVMH has not announced an intention to take over Gucci,
it is becoming clear just what it expects as the Italian company's
largest shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   LVMH, which owns Louis Vuitton, Givenchy and Dior, plans to take
an active role in running Gucci, but it will not seek to replace
Domenico De Sole as chief executive or Tom Ford as creative
director, an LVMH executive close to the situation said.
</P>
<P>
   LVMH wants to maximize the return on its investment by pushing
up profit margins at Gucci, to match those at Vuitton. The company
hopes to do this in part by cooperating with Gucci in buying
advertising space and developing retail stores, including in
shopping malls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instantly it becomes a luxury street if you have Celine,
Vuitton, Dior and Gucci,'' said the executive, who would discuss
LVMH's plans only on condition of anonymity. Japan is a likely
first site for such a constellation of LVMH-controled luxury
boutiques, but the strategy might be applied around the world. It
is also possible that the two luxury giants will cooperate on
production and purchasing raw materials.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike hostile takeovers that Berard Arnault, LVMH's chairman,
has previously waged against target companies, this time around he
thinks it is critical to retain Ford and De Sole, the two men who
remade Gucci into one of the hottest names in fashion today, the
executive said. Arnault has met several times with De Sole.
</P>
<P>
   And Arnault paints himself as a great fan of Ford's. ``He's a
great talent,'' Arnault said in an interview. ``I like very much
his involvement in the entire concept _ not only clothes, but bags,
advertising, the stores.''
</P>
<P>
   How ever much Arnault, the most powerful man in fashion, may
admire Ford's diverse responsibilities at Gucci, it is not the kind
of free rein he gives to his designers at LVMH.
</P>
<P>
   But Ford and De Sole view the prospect of working with LVMH with
less disdain than they had for the possibility that they might have
to work for their main rival, Prada, six months ago when Prada
bought 9.5 percent of Gucci's stock, Gucci executives said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day I have to run the company, my
responsibility is to make the business happen,'' De Sole said
following Gucci's men's show in Italy two weeks ago. Asked if he
expected an expanded role at LVMH, he said, ``I'm very happy
running Gucci.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the Prada stock purchase that first exposed Gucci's
vulnerability to takeover. LVMH, which has since bought Prada's
shares, first began quietly amassing Gucci stock 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Patrizio Bertelli, chairman of Prada and the man who quite
possibly made LVMH's control of Gucci possible, by selling his
chunk of stock to Arnault, says he is extremely pleased with the
way things have gone. He made at least a $135 million profit on his
stock sale and reached an agreement to cooperate with LVMH in areas
like leasing retail space and production. ``Competition is not just
played in the financial playground but also in products,'' Bertelli
said. But that agreement is informal, both sides said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, De Sole and Ford, will have to earn their freedom as
they go. Arnault has said, ``Autonomy is not a problem as long as
you are good and profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   In exercising control over Gucci, Arnault stands to gain not
only more leverage and profits in business but advantages on the
home front, too. He himself may continue to wear Dior suits but
Mrs. Helene Arnault, always a gracious understated presence at his
side at LVMH shows, is another matter. ``My wife is very happy,''
he said. ``She wanted for years, a Gucci bag. I told her: `You
cannot have a Gucci bag. You can have Dior.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now, she can have a Gucci bag and much, much more.

 &HT;    Panthers start second half with tough assignment
 &HT;    By Brian Biggane
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Playing on the road against the hottest team in
the NHL was a difficult enough assignment for the Florida Panthers.
The events that transpired Monday made it that much tougher.
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost was the injury situation. Right winger Scott
Mellanby, who was waiting for the team in Philadelphia, appears out
with a neck problem, while center Viktor Kozlov didn't even make
the trip due to his ailing shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Mellanby injured his neck twice in a span of six days and team
doctors are recommending he be X-rayed Wednesday before any
decision is made about when he might return.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to get him back to 100 percent, and he's not
there,'' Murray said. ``We haven't got a time frame, but once we
get the X-ray done, we'll have one by the Montreal game
(Wednesday).''
</P>
<P>
   Mellanby spent All-Star Weekend in New York and was joined by
wife Sue there Friday. The two had dinner one night with friends
including ex-Panther goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck and wife
Rosalinde and defenseman Luke Richardson and his wife. Both are now
Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny,'' he said. ``You get one weekend away from hockey
and all you wind up talking about is hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   Mellanby hadn't gone so far as to rule himself out of tonight's
game, and planned to skate with the team this morning. But he said
if team doctors have made a decision, he'll abide by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rangers' doctor told me that since I'd just had two
(injuries) close together, it was going to recur easier if I don't
let it heal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mellanby said he experienced difficulty sleeping his first two
nights in New York due to a stiff neck, but that the situation had
improved to about where it was before last Wednesday's game against
the Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think I'll be able to play within a week,'' he said.
``I would be surprised if it's longer than that. But I don't want
to keep going out there and have a chance of reinjuring it.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray said Kozlov skated through a full practice Monday and did
all the drills, but ``he's not where he needs to be'' to return.
</P>
<P>
   Kozlov has separated the same right shoulder twice in the past
15 months, leaving it susceptible to injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went to therapy all three days we were off and rehabbed
well,'' Murray said. ``He's coming along fine. It's concievable he
could be ready to go Wednesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray recalled right winger Mark Parrish, who, due to the AHL
All-Star break, had yet to play for New Haven after being sent down
Wednesday. Dino Ciccarelli, his two-game suspension behind him, is
also available.
</P>
<P>
   The injuries were only part of the bad news. Scheduled to leave
Fort Lauderdale at 10 a.m., the Panthers sat on the ground waiting
for their plane to be repaired until 3 p.m., then returned to the
National Car Rental Center for a 45-minute workout and finally took
off about 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us at the start it was going to take two minutes to
do the repair, and 10 more for the paperwork,'' coach Terry Murray
said. ``Then they started looking at other things.''
</P>
<P>
   While they did, the Panthers had lunch, watched a few movies _
and waited. But Murray, aware of the inconveniences that business
travelers routinely face, said it wasn't that bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a lot worse if we'd been sitting in the
terminal instead of on the plane,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Murray said that while he hadn't spoken to Pavel Bure, he's
hoping he'll be well-rested enough coming off the break to continue
to increase his playing time. Bure played 12:09 Wednesday and 19:39
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot depends on the player,'' he said. ``There comes a time
when he'll be showing energy, desire, even a need for more ice
time. If that happens (tonight), that's great.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers are indisputably playing the best hockey in the NHL
right now. They're 12-1-5 over the last 18 games and Vanbiesbrouck,
who has a 1.81 goals-against average and five shutouts, put
together a shutout streak of 218 minutes, 42 seconds earlier this
month.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Shaw, the renowned choral conductor and the elder
statesman and great spirit of American musical performance, died
Monday at a hospital in New Haven, Conn., where he had been
visiting one of his sons at Yale University. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a stroke, according to the Atlanta Symphony
Orchestra, of which he was music director emeritus and laureate
conductor. Shaw continued to perform until recently, although he
was increasingly forced to cancel appearances because of illness.
In his final New York performance, last April, he conducted Bach's
Mass in B minor at Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   He canceled his participation in the Robert Shaw Choral Workshop
at Carnegie Hall this month because of back problems, giving way to
his longtime assistant, Norman McKenzie, and to the conductor
Charles Dutoit. The same back problems kept him from attending a
memorial service last week for his friend Judith Arron, the
executive director of Carnegie Hall, who died last month.
</P>
<P>
   But he traveled to Yale over the weekend to see his son Thomas
perform in Beckett's ``Endgame,'' his senior acting and directing
project.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was music director of the Atlanta Symphony for 21
years, Shaw was always most respected for his work with choruses.
His lasting monuments include the Atlanta Symphony choruses and the
Collegiate Chorale in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lawson Shaw was born in Red Bluff, Calif., in 1916. His
father was a minister in the evangelical Church of the Disciples of
Christ and his mother a religious singer. He intended to enter the
ministry himself, but instead carried a preacher's flair and
hortatory air into his musical efforts, while expanding saltily on
a preacher's vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   He entered Pomona College in California in 1934, majoring in
religion and philosophy. But there, as director of the glee club,
he caught the ear of the popular radio band leader Fred Waring. He
moved to New York in 1938 and organized the Fred Waring Glee Club,
which he led until 1945.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941, he founded the Collegiate Chorale, an amateur group of
more than 150, as an outlet for more classical repertory. With the
chorale's racially diverse membership, which changed constantly
during the war years, Shaw liked to call it ``a melting pot that
sings.''
</P>
<P>
   As he would continue to do throughout his life, he expounded his
techniques and, even more, his philosophy in a series of lively
letters to the singers headed by a salutation that Joseph A.
Mussulman adopted as the title of his 1979 Shaw biography, ``Dear
People . . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a horrible picture, from the way you sing,'' he wrote to
chorale members in 1943, urging that attention be paid to small
notes, ``of little bitty eighth notes running like hell all over
the place to keep from being stepped on. Millions of 'em! Meek,
squeaky little things. No self-respect. Standing in corners, hiding
behind doors, ducking into subway stations, peering out from under
rugs. Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dammit, you're all a bunch of Whole-Note Nazis.''
</P>
<P>
   For Shaw, music was always more than a luxury or entertainment.
As a form of communication, it was spirit itself, a moral force.
``You don't join the Collegiate Chorale,'' he wrote. ``You believe
it. It's very damn near a religion.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1945 Shaw prepared choruses for performances by Arturo
Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra, including famous accounts
of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1945, still under Waring's auspices, Shaw undertook the
first of his many choral workshops. In 1948, he founded the Robert
Shaw Chorale, a professional group of 40, which toured and recorded
and made his name synonymous with excellent choral performance.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw conducted the San Diego Symphony from 1953 to 1958. He left
the Collegiate Chorale in 1954 and became associate conductor of
the Cleveland Orchestra under George Szell from 1956 to 1967. He
raised the Cleveland Orchestra Chorus to new heights.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, Shaw disbanded his chorale and moved to Atlanta, where
he served as music director of the Atlanta Symphony until 1988. He
oversaw the orchestra's transition from a part-time group of 60
players to a full-time, year-round ensemble of 93. He conducted the
Atlanta Symphony in its Carnegie Hall debut, in 1971, and at the
inauguration of President Jimmy Carter in Washington, in 1977. He
led its first European tour, in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, Shaw founded the Atlanta Symphony Chamber Chorus, and
three years later he added the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra Chorus.
He retained close ties to both until his death.
</P>
<P>
   Already in 1943, the National Association of Composers and
Conductors named Shaw ``America's greatest choral conductor.'' That
reputation grew and was certified in 1990, when Carnegie Hall
established an annual series of professional workshops under his
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's rehearsal techniques, isolating rhythm, pitch or
enunciation, were calculated for maximum effect and efficiency, and
could seem mechanistic at times.
</P>
<P>
   He carried a similar pragmatism into his treatment of scores. He
might re-seat singers, mixing voices to achieve a homogeneous
overall sound, or shift voices to another line if it suited his
concept of the desired sonority or the way that sonority was best
projected.
</P>
<P>
   But he could turn around and discourse at length on the
spiritual and mystical meanings of a text. His pacifist ideals
seemed fully intact as he prepared Britten's ``War Requiem'' for
performance at the Carnegie Hall workshop in 1994. ``Whether any
one of us `makes it' in a hereafter I find somehow less important
than the presence of humanity such as this,'' he said of Wilfred
Owen's text and Britten's music.
</P>
<P>
   Other notable Shaw performances of recent years at Carnegie Hall
included a Handel ``Messiah'' in 1992, on the 250th anniversary of
the work's premiere, and a Mahler ``Symphony of a Thousand,'' in
1995, with the Cleveland Orchestra, joined by hundreds of
choristers around the hall.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw fostered the solo careers of young singers, including
Sylvia McNair, Marietta Simpson, John Aler and David Arnold. He
also promoted contemporary music, and won awards for his service to
new or American music. In 1983, he initiated a commissioning
program, the American Music Project, in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   He was made a member of the National Council for the Arts in
1979. He was awarded Kennedy Center Honors in 1991 and the National
Medal of Arts in 1992 and named ``Officier des Arts et des
Lettres'' by the French government in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   His conducting won 14 Grammys, and his latest recording, of
music by Barber, Bartok and Vaughan Williams, has been nominated
for an award this year. He prepared English translations of many of
the choral masterworks he conducted. He often talked about writing
several books, but never got around to them.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw seemed crushed when his second wife, Caroline Saulas, died
in 1995, after 21 years of marriage. (He and his first wife, Maxine
Farley, were divorced in 1970.) ``The problem is simply
loneliness,'' he said in 1996. ``I've never met a marriage quite
like it. I've only experienced two, really, and one of them was my
parents'.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son Thomas Lawson Shaw of Atlanta, Shaw is
survived by a daughter, Dr. Johanna Shaw of Providence, R.I.; two
other sons, Peter Thain Shaw of Portland, Ore., and John Thaddeus
Shaw of Lathrop, Calif.; a stepson, Alexander Crawford Hitz of
Atlanta; a sister, Mrs. Harrison Price of San Pedro, Calif., and a
brother, John, of Baldwin Park, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   It was possible to admire Shaw's craftsmanship and respect his
achievement without invariably swooning at the results. Often
enough, all those spiritual elements that went into the making of a
performance shone through nobly, but at times a performance could
seem merely ``perfect'' _ meticulous, wondrously refined, even
powerful _ without piercing to the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his achievement is likely to remain the standard for many
decades, largely in the hands of the disciples he cultivated. As
for Shaw himself, he is undoubtedly already appraising the heavenly
choirs with a jaundiced ear, wondering how best to go about shaping
them up. He will probably not be diplomatic about the need to do
so.

   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ With the Olympic movement in dishonor
because of the greatest corruption scandal in its history, its
leader, Juan Antonio Samaranch, appears to have convinced himself
that he can restore his legacy by cleaning up the contaminated
bidding process for the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Battered in recent days by calls from some Olympic officials and
journalists for him to resign, Samaranch, the head of the
International Olympic Committee, Monday affirmed his resolve to
remain in his position and deal with the crisis. After expelling a
half-dozen members on Sunday, and proposing to prohibit most
committee members from visiting or voting on prospective cities, he
appeared feisty, defiant and definitely in charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been elected by members of the IOC, not by outside
people,'' Samaranch said. ``I am not thinking about any kind of
resignation in this moment that the Olympic movement is in real
danger, a time when the IOC is facing many difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, he seemed to be unsure in his public statements
about whether he still had widespread support among the 106 IOC
members. He appeared to be seeking a symbolic vote of confidence
among senior committee officials. Now that they have stood up for
him, Samaranch is displaying the resolve at age 78 to finish out
the last two years of his term, believing he can revive the Olympic
movement again, just as he did in the boycott-troubled days of the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honest people should stay,'' Marc Hodler, a senior IOC member
from Switzerland who blew the whistle on the Salt Lake City bribery
scandal, said of Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch also demonstrated Monday that he would not be content
to sit by quietly amid criticism and demands that he relinquish his
position.
</P>
<P>
   He took a jab Monday at Robert Helmick, a former IOC member and
president of the United States Olympic Committee, who has
repeatedly called for Samaranch's resignation in light of the Salt
Lake City bribery scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch said that Helmick had no right to call for anyone to
step aside, considering that Helmick resigned both his Olympic
posts in 1991 amid allegations of conflict of interest in
representing clients with Olympic connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this proposition is coming from Helmick, for me it has not
any kind of value,'' Samaranch said. ``This is a man who had to
resign because he was facing expulsion from the IOC.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch also disputed the perceptions that he is an autocratic
leader and the symbol, rightly or wrongly, of the excessive life
style that IOC members are seen as living.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Warren, who was the coordinator of international relations
for the Salt Lake City bid committee in 1990 and 1991, has
criticized Samaranch for demanding private jets, presidential
suites, limousines and a special type of exercise ski machine.
Stories have also appeared saying that Samaranch takes a helicopter
for the short 40-mile trip from IOC headquarters in Lausanne to the
international airport in Geneva, and that the IOC demands a
particular kind of caviar be provided to its members by the bidding
cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot answer all these silly things,'' Samaranch said.
``How I can take a helicopter from Lausanne to Geneva? That's
stupid. Also I read, in contracts of bidding cities, we want a
certain quality of caviar. I am a normal person. I am dedicating 85
percent of my time to the International Olympic Committee. In
Lausanne, I have a very small suite, paying 300 Swiss francs a day.
I like to work for the Olympic movement. I don't like big dinners,
or big lunches. I'm doing my best to try to be fit with physical
exercises every morning. That's my life.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I am not a rich man. I am a normal man. But I can
tell you that my style of life is the same for many, many years. I
have no yachts, I have no planes, I have no many things. I have no
cars, no luxury cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his resolve to improve the process, Samaranch was not
treated well as reaction to the scandal spread throughout Europe.
The sentiment in daily newspapers was generally unforgiving.
</P>
<P>
   In a front-page editorial, the Dutch newspaper Trouwit said it
was ``brazen of Samaranch to stay put.'' Even the Madrid-based
daily El Pais in Samaranch's native Spain was critical, saying
``Aside from corrupt individuals ... the IOC is an anachronistic
body that requires urgent reform.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He was asked whether he had made any leadership mistakes that
led to inappropriate behavior of 14 IOC members in accepting cash
benefits, tuition aid, medical treatment and other lavish benefits
from Salt Lake City officials? He feinted, and counterpunched and
let the question die.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mistakes, I don't know,'' Samaranch said. ``I made mistakes,
but I would also like to tell you the IOC is not run by myself, the
IOC is run mainly by the executive board. Maybe our mistake was not
to be, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   He has said repeatedly, and other IOC officials have backed
Samaranch up, that he did investigate rumors of inappropriate
bidding, but that no cities ever came forward with the facts until
Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Baird, a former Olympics minister in Australia, said last
week that he had been approached by an IOC member and another
person seeking cash in exchange for delivering votes to Sydney's
bid to host the 2000 Summer Games. Baird's letter has arrived at
the IOC but contained no names, said Francois Carrard, the IOC's
executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was absolutely no help for us to investigate,'' Carrard
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we had some rumors, we thought we could get some facts,''
Samaranch said. ``It's very difficult. Now for the first time we
have facts. We acted very quickly. From all these commissions
investigating Salt Lake City, we were the first commission to
present the results.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Samaranch said, he repeatedly proposed letting only
the 11-member executive board, not the full IOC assembly that now
stands at 106 members, determine the host cities. ``But we couldn't
convince the members,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassed and chastened by the Salt Lake City scandal, the
members will now fall in line, Samaranch said. One member, asking
that his name not be used, said Monday, ``If you don't vote, you
don't have an IOC, but it is my job to support my president.''
</P>
<P>
   The cities bidding on the 2006 Winter Games, to be awarded in
June, are not happy about that possibility that they won't be able
to show off their hometowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new system is a demonstration of the distrust by the IOC
of its own members,'' said Krzysztof Gorlich, a member of the bid
committee for Zakopane, Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch said he could not imagine that the six expelled
members would be reinstated by a vote of the full IOC assembly in
March.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his legacy after 18 years as IOC president,
Samaranch mentioned the financial revival of the Games, the
opportunities for women as IOC members and athletes, the renewed
universal appeal of the Olympics and his program of naming more
international sports officials and former Olympic athletes to the
IOC assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the IOC is run very well,'' he said. ``The results are
excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   If that seemed an odd thing to say as the Olympic movement
hovers in its most precarious position in two decades, Samaranch
also said that the hundreds of journalists present on Sunday for
the announcement of expulsions and reforms was an encouraging sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased with myself what I did during these 18 years,''
Samaranch said. He changed the Olympic movement, he said, and the
proof was in the news media interest in Sunday's expulsions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means the international Olympic movement is very much
important, even more important than I thought, in society today,''
he said. &QL;

 &HT;    Riley still considering Rodman
 &HT;    By Tom D'Angelo
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Pat Riley will be doing more than running two grueling,
regimented practices a day at the Heat's training camp in Boca
Raton.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be mulling over the idea of signing free agent forward
Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll think about it when I get up to Boca,'' Riley said
Monday, before leaving for Boca. ``It might be an interesting
conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   If Riley does contact Rodman between Rodman's commitments (i.e.
parties) on South Beach this week, he will then discuss the issue
with his team. The two players who matters most _ Alonzo Mourning
and Tim Hardaway _ have given Riley the go-ahead to make the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd ask (Riley), `Can YOU deal with Dennis Rodman's stuff,''
Hardaway said. ``I can deal with anybody's stuff. It's all about
winning championships. If we get him, I'd open my arms to him and
say, `C'mon, just win me one of those rings.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway and Rodman actually appeared to get along on the court,
even as opponents. Hardaway is from Chicago where Rodman played the
last three years. Hardaway believes for all his showmanship, Rodman
would fit a Heat need; rebounding and defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a great addition,'' he said. ``We'd just have to
calm him down like the Bulls did and get him away from
altercations, get him away from talking to the referees, all that
type of stuff. Just get him away.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman said he would like to play for Miami or Orlando. The Heat
have a far greater need for a rebounder and extra power forward
than the Magic, who have Horace Grant, Bo Outlaw and Derek Strong.
The Magic are saying they will not pursue Rodman. ``I don't know if
Orlando is big enough for Dennis Rodman,'' Magic coach Chuck Daly
said.
</P>
<P>
   If Riley does decide he wants to meet Rodman this week, he could
attend the party Rodman and his wife, Carmen Electra, are hosting
Thursday at Liquid on South Beach. Tickets are $30, which allows
admission to the XXX No No Room, Retro Drag room and Funk room.
</P>
<P>
   Or, Rodman could meet Riley at the Boca Raton Resort &AMP; Club.
</P>
<P>
   Barry deal done: Brent Barry signed with the Bulls Monday for
less money on the average than the Heat was offering. He will make
$27 million for six seasons in Chicago. He turned down $15 million
for three years from the Heat.
</P>
<P>
   Barry believes Riley's reaction to his leaving Miami was out of
frustration for getting nothing for Ike Austin. Riley said he did
not feel as bad as some teams who lost a ``proven free agent,'' and
joked about the Bulls believing they got the next Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to go where I was wanted and Chicago was that
place,'' said Barry, who was traded to Miami a year ago for Austin.
``I think coach Riley was just upset he didn't get anything out of
the deal he made last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry made several references to feeling unwanted by the Heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was about 75 percent at best when I was playing for him and
trying to learn a whole new system,'' Barry said about his 17 games
in Miami. ``The team was already winning and had their team in
place. Had I gone back to Miami things would have progressed for me
there. But my decision was to come where I was wanted and the style
of play fit me.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry added he does not believe there is bad blood between he
and Riley.
</P>
<P>
   Mills hurting: Forward Terry Mills probably will start the
season on the injured list because of his sore left knee. Mills has
not been able to scrimmage is receiving three anti-inflammatory
injections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing,'' Riley said. ``He's had a very difficult
time with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills received the second shot Monday and will have one more
next week. Each shot requires a couple of days recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'll be (ready) to go (in the Feb. 5 opener),''
Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   Mills has been bothered by the knee since having surgery almost
two years ago. He walks with a noticeable limp.
</P>
<P>
   Open scrimmage: The Heat will hold an open scrimmage at 7 p.m.
Thursday at Florida Atlantic University. Fans will be selected at
random to join the team on the court for shooting and conditioning
drills.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat have scheduled double sessions at FAU today through
Friday. All practices except Thursday evening will be closed to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Lenard update: Voshon Lenard had a another full day of practice,
more evidence that he is leaning toward delaying surgery on the
stress fracture in his left leg to possibly after the season.
</P>
<P>
   Riley said he will be x-rayed weekly to monitor the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gone through the last two practices very well,'' Riley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Noteworthy: Riley said he notices one thing about players from
the CBA, their lack of conditioning. ``You find out just how out of
shape they are,'' Riley said. ``Tough trips on busses, you spend a
lot of time in those hamburger houses.'' One of those was Randy
Livingston, who has lost about 12 pounds in the last week. ...
Riley and Hardaway praised free agent forward Amal McCaskill and
rookie swingman Adrian Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Hamilton is working his way back into practice after
sitting out because of a sore knee. ``He's a project,'' Riley said
of the 360-pound center. ``Everybody sees this basketball player in
that body. The only way it will ever work for Tom is if he wants it
to work. The only way is if he gets in shape. We can all give him
chances but until he commits one year of his life to what Ike
(Austin) did, and get down to 320 or 310 pounds, I don't think it
will work.''

<P>
   Whether because of the economy, the euro, media hype, Bernard
Arnault, an infusion of new money from Germany and the former
Eastern Bloc, or just the same old let-them-eat-cake attitude,
haute couture doesn't appear to be a glamorous dodo bird after all.
</P>
<P>
   It was eight years ago _ July 1991, to be exact _ that Pierre
Berge, the outspoken head of Yves Saint Laurent, stood before a
small group of reporters in the emptied ballroom of the
Intercontinental Hotel in Paris and memorably said: ``Believe me,
it's true when I tell you these are the last days for haute
couture. Maybe not tomorrow or next month, but in 10 years it will
be finished.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, was before anyone knew what to make of Arnault,
the upstart chairman of the luxury conglomerate LVMH Moet
Hennessy-Louis Vuitton, who four years before Berge's dire
prediction was managing his family's real estate holdings in New
Rochelle, N.Y. That was before John Galliano, who ran through
investors like a small child running through a candy shop, turned
up at Dior in a George Brent mustache and set Paris on its ear with
swooning romance. And that was before anyone had heard of the
Lebanese-born Mouna al-Rashid, a big couture customer, or the
Miller sisters or, for that matter, young France Goldman of Boca
Raton, Fla., who was in the front row at all the major shows last
week with her husband, David, and expected to order something from
each of her four or five favorite houses.
</P>
<P>
   One week after the conclusion of the semiannual showings of
haute couture in Paris, reports of the death of this anachronistic
and outrageously indulgent institution are exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, this is a very different world,'' said John Rosecrans
as he waited to go into the Dior show with his wife, Dodie, who had
on a pencil-thin gray suit with a pair of black Manolo Blahnik
monkey-fur boots. Rosecrans, who was in the toy and sporting goods
business before selling to Mattel, says he comes to couture for its
sense of refinement, not to mention the frenetic social scene. And
he can still recall the first dress he picked out for his wife (a
cerise Balenciaga gown) right after they were married 39 years ago.
``There are a lot of people who enjoy spending money on clothes,''
he said. ``I think it's a wonderful thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In good times or bad, couture has always been the domain of a
few rich nomads _ titled Europeans, Arabian princesses, the
socially registered _ who don't mind spending $20,000 for a little
black dress. Even onlookers, like the actress Katherine Boorman,
daughter of the director John Boorman, can be caught up in
couture's elusiveness. ``You're inspired,'' Ms. Boorman said before
the Chanel show. ``And that's thrilling enough.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, while couture seems a curiously old-fashioned pursuit for
avant-garde designers like Jean-Paul Gaultier and the Dutch-born
Josephus Thimister, the clients themselves have also changed with
the times.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's different is they have no time,'' said Joy Hendricks,
director of couture sales at Chanel, sounding the lament of every
women. ``Either they don't want to come to Paris for two fittings,
or they want their clothes sooner than they can be made.''
Giancarlo Giametti, the partner of Valentino, agreed. ``The clients
don't want to come to Rome,'' he said. ``You don't think of the
woman who goes to Le Cirque every day for lunch. That's finished.''
The upshot is that most big houses now keep a sales executive on
the road most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Another difference is that clients are buying fewer daytime
looks _ those they evidently get from ready-to-wear designers _ and
more evening and special occasion clothes, particularly for
weddings. A few days before Alexander McQueen's spring show last
week, Caroline Grouvel, the couture sales director at Givenchy,
said that she had already booked three weddings from the
collection, even though the clients had yet to see it. Last year,
Christian Lacroix's workrooms produced clothes for 28 weddings, an
extraordinary number considering a couture wedding gown costs at
least $150,000 and most clients buy for the other members of the
wedding as well.
</P>
<P>
   Though the fashion press still fusses over clients who have
social or royal pedigrees _ and looks askance at those in the front
row who wear diamonds in the afternoon _ the truth is couture has
always depended on new-money customers. ``I hate this word `new,'''
Ms. Hendricks said, frowning. ``I mean, there are new people coming
along, new money. So what?'' Today, customers come not from France,
but from Brazil, Mexico, Germany and the United States. Nunzio
Palamara, head of couture sales at Versace, says he has a German
client who buys 25 to 50 pieces a season, which represents millions
of dollars. Givenchy has a male customer who buys a couple of
frocks every season _ for art, you understand.
</P>
<P>
   That's one thing about the couture houses _ they don't
discriminate. Money is money, whether it comes from ancient
aristocrats or the daughters of Russian arms dealers. ``Anyway,
we're not the foreign office,'' Dior's press chief, Bernard
Danillon de Cazella, said.
</P>
<P>
   Berge, in his Paris office on the Avenue Marceau, agreed that
new designers have brought an excitement to couture, but he hasn't
changed his stance about its doomed future. ``For me, there is only
one new designer,'' he said. ``It's Gaultier. You have other
people, more or less, more or less'' _ Berge rolled his eyes _
``that are a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Berge, who has said that he would close the Saint Laurent
couture house the day Saint Laurent retired, continued: ``You have
to understand, haute couture is not only for fashion shows. It is
not only for two rich women who can buy a rich look. That is not
the destiny of haute couture. The destiny is to help with the art
of living. And my question today is: What is the art of life? I'm
not blind. I can see how people in the streets dress. They don't
care. They are miles and miles away from haute couture.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does Berge buy the conventional wisdom that the publicity
that couture generates for the house, and its other lines, is
enough to justify its existence. He could be right. Danillon de
Cazella of Dior may point with pride to his binders of press
clippings, but has Galliano _ and his employer, LVMH _ really
succeeded in exploiting the attention given to couture to sell
ready-to-wear and perfume? Many fashion insiders say there is a
gulf between what Galliano creates and what Dior's image is in the
consumer's mind.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there were signs last week of frustration in the LVMH
ranks, with designers complaining about management's failure to
market their creativity. ``If they don't know what direction they
want, how can I give it to them?'' McQueen asked. Lacroix, too,
sounded weary about some LVMH strategies. ``A lot of money has been
spent in the wrong ways,'' he said over a sandwich after his
triumphant show. ``They have very poor follow through.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Senate entered the third week of impeachment
proceedings, Republicans rejected a proposal on Monday that would
have ended the trial of President Clinton without calling any
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they worked with the House Republican prosecutors to
draw up a modest witness list. The move came as the Senate went
into a secret session Monday night to debate a Democratic proposal
to dismiss the charges against Mr. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   With that proposal given little chance of succeeding, the Senate
is expected to debate and then vote later this week on whether to
call witnesses. The Senate Republicans and House Republican
prosecutors are trying to put together a witness list small enough
to overcome objections of Democrats who do not want to call any
witnesses at all, but large enough to satisfy Republicans who want
to hear at least some testimony.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, fearful of further partisan strife after the
weekend turmoil over the House questioning of Monica Lewinsky,
Sens. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., and Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., offered
both parties a proposal. They suggested that the votes on dismissal
and witnesses be skipped and that the trial move to closing debate,
with a vote on the articles of impeachment on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman described the plan as a ``mutual withdrawal of
forces'' under which Democrats would drop the effort to dismiss the
case outright and Republicans would not push for witnesses. It was
presented to the Democrats and Republicans at separate caucuses
Monday morning, and Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority
leader, announced that Democrats could support the plan.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the Republican caucus was still under way, John
Czwartacki, the spokesman for Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the
majority leader, said the idea had been ``summarily rejected.''
Republicans said that their caucus was divided, with some people
exhausted and leery of witnesses but others still wanting to give
the House prosecutors the right to move forward with their case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard for me to envision as a trier of fact who has taken
an oath, judging this case, without seeing the most important
witness or witnesses,'' said Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio. Sen. Tim
Hutchinson, R-Ark., said there was a ``difference of opinion''
among Republicans over the need for witnesses. ``Everybody would
like this thing to end, and they hate to think of a couple of more
weeks of depositions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After rejecting the offer, Senate Republicans summoned some of
the House managers to the Capitol to winnow the prosecutors' list
of half a dozen witnesses down to two or three, in hopes that such
a list could win a majority vote later this week, perhaps even
winning some Democratic support.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans were also examining a plan for the end of the
trial under which the Senate could vote to find that Clinton had
committed the offenses charged in the two articles of impeachment,
but not actually remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Senate is thought to have no chance of assembling the
67 votes to convict Clinton, some Republicans believe this would
amount to a stringent form of censure. It would take only 51 votes
for the finding of facts _ meaning that it could be muscled through
by the Republican majority. The Democrats say the plan is
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   To keep pressure on the White House, Lott and nine other
senators submitted 10 written questions to President Clinton,
taking advantage of an opening that the White House had given them
and then retracted on Saturday. They asked that he respond ``in
writing and under oath'' to the questions, which began by asking if
everything the president had testified to in the case brought by
Paula Jones was true.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not,'' the question continued, ``what did you testify to
that you now believe is not truthful? Please begin your answer with
a yes or no.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, said neither
Clinton nor his lawyers would respond to the questions, which he
said violated the bipartisan deal on trial procedures. ``I'd
suggest this has more to do with playing politics than with trying
to bring this to a fair and expeditious conclusion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the two parties once again parted ways, efforts
persisted to search for a bipartisan solution. Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, called Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., seeking support
for a two-person witness list and a date certain to end the trial.
After consulting Daschle, Kennedy relayed the message that the
Democrats were standing firm against witnesses, according to one
Democratic official.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One attempt at negotiation took place openly in front of a
cluster of reporters when Max Baucus, D-Mont., stopped abruptly in
the Senate's subway to ask Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, if the
Republicans had embraced the plan to move to the end of the trial.
``Could you think of an element that might help?'' Baucus asked.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley wondered in return whether Democratic opposition to
witnesses would extend to ``even a very circumscribed form for
witnesses, depositions, just a short period of time?'' Baucus said
it probably would, and the two men went their separate ways.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Facing a deadline of Tuesday to submit their witness list to the
Senate, the House managers _ a day after interviewing Ms. Lewinsky
_ began the day badly divided over how to proceed. Bowing to the
Senate's reluctance to call a large number of witnesses, some of
the prosecutors were willing to cull their list down to two or
three people, including Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But others continued to insist they needed to go beyond Ms.
Lewinsky and call a core group of five witnesses, to make their
case, including the White House aides and advisers Betty Currie,
Vernon Jordan, John Podesta, Sidney Blumenthal. There was also
interest in Clinton's former political consultant, Dick Morris.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate is over who should be added and whether they'd be
accepted by the Senate,'' Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., one of the
13 House prosecutors said after they held a midday meeting. ``We
believe in our case and we want a way to present it, and we're
going to keep arguing that point to the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as the meeting was ending, some of the prosecutors,
including Hutchinson and Rep. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina,
were summoned to a Capitol office by a small group of Senate
Republicans, including Sen. Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania
Republican, to discuss the witness issue.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By Monday night, the four prosecutors who will make the case for
witnesses on Tuesday _ Hutchinson, James Rogan of California, Ed
Bryant of Tennessee and Bill McCollum of Florida _ were paring down
the list, and one Republican aide said there would probably be no
more than three names submitted to the Senate. Even earlier in the
day Rogan had signaled that they would move in this direction.
``We've got to prioritize and get down to a bare minimum and not
run the risk of getting zero witnesses because we put on one too
many,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Ms. Lewinsky, it was not certain which witnesses the
prosecutors would settle on. They were to meet again on Tuesday
before the session.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors did win one victory on Monday. Ruling a day
after the prosecutors interviewed Ms. Lewinsky, Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist rejected an effort by Sen. Tom Harkin, an Iowa
Democrat, to halt such interviews until after the Senate votes on
witnesses. In a letter to Harkin, the justice said, ``It is quite
debatable whether merely interviewing a witness'' violated the
bipartisan agreement establishing the vote on witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate went into closed session Monday night to debate the
motion by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., to dismiss the trial. But the
pair of votes on that motion and on witnesses are not expected
until late Tuesday night or Wednesday. Lott said confidently that
the Republicans who control the chamber 55-45 ``have the votes'' to
block dismissal of the case.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And suggesting that even some Democrats might oppose dismissal,
Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., tried unsuccessfully to have the
vote on stopping the case, separated into two votes, one for each
article of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It was less certain how the Senate will vote on witnesses, a
motion that requires a simple majority of 51 votes to pass or fail.
Several Republicans have expressed unease at extending the trial by
calling the principals in the case. But it was not clear how many
of them would vote with Democrats against witnesses. If all 45
Democrats hold together to oppose witnesses, then six Republicans
are needed to prevent testimony. And some of the wavering lawmakers
are likely to be swayed by the scope of the House witness list.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody can show me that this will change the dynamics of
the trial,'' said Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., ``that's a different
story. I don't believe that's going to happen. But I haven't closed
my mind totally yet.'' He said a number of Republicans shared his
concern.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were also exploring whether they could end the trial
by voting on a statement of facts on each of the articles of
impeachment and then separately on the articles themselves. That
would allow senators to make a statement that Clinton had committed
perjury and obstructed justice as the House charged, but not to
remove him from office. Democrats said they would oppose such a
plan as unconstitutional.

SPORTS COLUMN: RANKING GOLF'S NEW 59 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most golfers are happy to break 100. Decent golfers sometimes
break 90. Good golfers often break 80. Touring pros expect to break
70. But only a chosen few break 60.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval is now among the chosen few.
</P>
<P>
   In firing a 13-under-par 59 to win the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic
on Sunday, Duval has created a feature threesome with Al Geiberger
and Chip Beck, the only others to shoot 59 in a PGA Tour event.
</P>
<P>
   Geiberger did it in the 1977 Memphis Classic, Beck in 1991
during the Las Vegas Invitational, both on par-72 courses.
</P>
<P>
   As the first to do it, Geiberger, a lean Californian who ate
peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches during a round, was rebaptized
59. His business card opened to a miniature replica of his 59
scorecard.
</P>
<P>
   Beck was lucky enough to shoot his 59 when the Hilton hotel
chain was offering a $1 million bonus to anybody breaking 60 in a
PGA Tour event. He also was kind enough to donate $500,000 of that
bonus to charity.
</P>
<P>
   But now Duval is not only the new 59, he doesn't need a business
card. His name has replaced Tiger Woods and Mark O'Meara on golf's
moveable marquee.
</P>
<P>
   In his last 28 tournaments, Duval has won nine, virtually one
out of every three. In two tournaments this year, he has won both,
including the Mercedes-Benz Tournament of Champions in Hawaii. He
leads the PGA Tour money list with more than $1 million, and it's
still January.
</P>
<P>
   In the world ranking, based on a two-year weighted system, Duval
is still No. 3, behind Woods and O'Meara, but he is the world's
hottest golfer. With four victories last year, he led the PGA
Tour's money list with more than $2 million, but he knows why
O'Meara was player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically,'' agreed Duval, ``Mark had a better year.''
</P>
<P>
   In golf, history counts more, meaning major titles _ the
Masters, the U.S. Open, the British Open and the Professional
Golfers Association Championship. Duval knows. He was leading the
Masters last year until O'Meara birdied the last two holes to win.
O'Meara also won the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   But now Duval has shot a 59.
</P>
<P>
   To do it, he needed a six-foot eagle putt on the 18th green and
made it to win the tournament _ the clinching argument that of the
three 59's, his deserves to be ranked as the most impressive.
</P>
<P>
   To appreciate Duval's score, consider that Jack Nicklaus, Arnold
Palmer, Tom Watson and Greg Norman never shot lower than 62 in a
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Duval produced the one most impressive round in golf
history. Golf coexists with a theory of relativity that Einstein
never considered: the difficultly of the course, the rough, the
bunkers, the speed of the greens, the weather, the wind, and the
stature of the tournament as well as the round _ first, second,
third, final.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the burden of trying to win a major in the final
round on a brutally difficult course, three scores are etched in
history: Johnny Miller's 63 to win the 1973 U.S. Open at Oakmont,
Arnold Palmer's 65 to win the 1960 U.S. Open at Cherry Hills, and
Ben Hogan's 67 to win the 1951 U.S. Open at Oakland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 59's involved a major.
</P>
<P>
   Geiberger's 59 occurred in the second round on the 7,249-yard
Colonial Country Club course. Because of soggy conditions, the pros
were allowed to ``lift, clean and place'' their ball. He
acknowledged moving the ball nine times. He holed a 30-foot wedge
shot as well as putts of 40, 20 and 18 feet. He held on to win with
a final two rounds of 72-70.
</P>
<P>
   Beck's 59 occurred in the third round on the wide-open
6,979-yard Sunset Country Club course that was virtually treeless
and roughless. Then only 11 months old, it was used only that one
year in the Las Vegas tournament. He had 13 birdies, sinking putts
of eight and four feet on the last two holes. He finished third,
two strokes behind.
</P>
<P>
   Duval shot his 59 on the 6,950-yard Arnold Palmer Private course
at PGA West in La Quinta, Calif., coming from six strokes behind.
He did it with laser approach shots. In his back-nine 28, he holed
birdie putts of 4, 4, 2, 10 and 6 feet, and 18 inches.
</P>
<P>
   About all David Duval can do now to top that is shoot 58, but to
have a ``historically'' better year, he would rather win a major.

<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ A major credit rating service on Monday
downgraded its assessment of Brazil's ability to repay debts, and
the value of the Brazilian currency fell nearly 4 percent in a
further sign of investor anxiety about Latin America's biggest
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The developments came as Brazilian officials sought to reassure
financial markets that their decision a week ago to let the
currency, the real, trade without artificial controls would not be
changed.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, the currency has fallen by nearly a third.
</P>
<P>
   Duff &AMP; Phelps Credit Rating Service said it saw a one-in-three
risk that Brazil would default on some of its debts, partly because
the devaluation of the real means it costs much more to repay them.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a legal holiday, the Sao Paulo stock market was
closed. But in foreign-exchange dealings, which were not affected
by the holiday, the real weakened to 1.8 to the dollar from 1.71.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threat of a local currency default is now quite high,''
said Jaime Sanz, director of Latin American ratings for Duff &AMP;
Phelps.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, speculation swirled around the cancellation of
a trip to Brazil by the head of the International Monetary Fund's
negotiating team, Teresa Tere-Minaffian. Markets took the change of
plans as a sign of the fund's displeasure at a lack of direction by
Brazilian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF took the unusual step of denying that her trip was
canceled because of any dispute with Brazilian authorities, and
instead dispatched a technical mission to Brasilia Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   In press interviews since Friday, the Brazilian finance
minister, Pedro Malan, and the central bank president, Francisco
Lopes, have pledged that Brazil will not move to control the
movement of dollars from its foreign reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Economists are predicting a painful recession this year, with
the economy shrinking 6 to 8 percent. According to Lopes, more than
$7 billion had left Brazil's foreign reserves by the time the
government decided to abandon its policy of protecting the real's
value by intervening in foreign exchange markets by purchasing
reals with dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But the policy turnaround has failed to stop the exodus of
foreign reserves. In the last two days of last week, $1 billion
left Brazil for safer investments overseas, shrinking total foreign
reserves to less than $26 billion, roughly a third of their level
last summer.

MORE AMERICANS FIND WAYS TO VISIT CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Jan. 31)  
(mk) 
 By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the Marina Hemingway, a complex of hotels, restaurants and
shops in Havana, Cuba, the grocery store's shelves are stacked with
Kellogg's Corn Flakes and Rice Krispies, Nestle chocolate bars and
American cigarettes. English is spoken in the aisles. The sights
and sounds are so familiar that Americans may have to remind
themselves that they are in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   A popular playground for Americans before the revolution, Cuba
has been off limits to tourists from the United States for most of
Fidel Castro's four-decade-old rule. Under restrictions imposed by
the American economic embargo, now in its 37th year, only certain
travelers _ including journalists, government officials and those
visiting close family once a year for humanitarian reasons _ can
visit Cuba, spending up to $100 a day for living expenses. In
addition, travelers can apply for a specific license to go if they
have a religious or educational purpose, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody else is banned from spending money under the Trading
with the Enemy Act, which in practice deters travel. But while the
embargo has minimized American tourism, more Americans have found
ways to visit since limited free-market reforms adopted by Cuba in
the 1990s legalized the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Since Pope John Paul II's visit last year, the number of
American religious and academic groups wanting to visit has
skyrocketed, some travel agencies say. Bob Guild, program director
for Marazul Tours in Weehawken, N.J., said his agency has booked 45
such groups just this month _ all traveling legally under federal
licenses _ compared to five or six groups during the same period in
past years. Neither Cuban nor American officials have estimates of
American visitors, saying the number is difficult to gauge because
of unauthorized travel.
</P>
<P>
   At any given time, nine out of 10 boats at Marina Hemingway come
from the United States. Americans traveling through third countries
like Jamaica on package tours can often be found at the Tropicana,
the legendary outdoor nightclub where Las Vegas-type chorus girls
dance with chandeliers on their heads to Cuban rhythms. In
Varadero, Cuba's premier tourist beach area, the high-end hotels
also draw American visitors seeking respite from the decay and
hardship that are now staples of this socialist country of about 11
million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Curiosity _ that's what brings everybody,'' said a 55-year-old
boater and construction worker from Key West, Fla., who has been
anchored at the Marina Hemingway for two months and is on his third
visit since last year. He refused to give his name. ``You just want
to go visit places and see what it's like.''
</P>
<P>
   What Cuba is like can best be described as a time warp. The ride
from the Jose Marti International Airport into Havana offers a
surreal sight: roads populated by bicycles and 1950s Cadillacs,
some decrepit but many in mint condition; billboards filled with
revolutionary slogans; the utter absence of fast-food franchises or
chain hotels.
</P>
<P>
   In Old Havana, unpainted, sometimes crumbling colonial
architecture remains magnificent. And an excursion to the
countryside, to places like the Vinales Valley in the Pinar del Rio
Province, and to beaches and mountains unspoiled by development,
makes a visitor feel just plain lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Travel throughout the island is unrestricted; visitors can get
around by bus, train, airplane and car. Public transportation is
overwhelmed by demand, but tours are available and visitors can
also rent a car, or hire a driver with a car.
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans visiting for the first time say they are struck
by the friendliness of the people and the apparent lack of the
abject poverty they have found in places like Africa and India.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone had shoes, everyone had clothes on their backs,''
said a 32-year-old Miami woman who traveled illegally through
Nassau recently and stayed with the family of a Cuban-American
friend. ``We didn't see starving people.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, economic conditions make it necessary for Cuba to ration
rice, sugar and other staples, and lead even professionals to
moonlight as drivers and ``jineteras,'' Cuba's prostitutes, who are
the draw for a thriving sex tourism industry. A heavy-handed
government provides amenities for tourists that the Cuban people
can only dream of.
</P>
<P>
   This can all translate into deeply unsettling experiences for a
visitor. It is not uncommon, for instance, to dine at a nice
restaurant next to kissing couples, teen-aged girls and men three
or four times their age; or to have Cuban friends suffer the
humiliation of being denied entry to hotels, even to the lobby for
a visit. American officials call it ``tourism apartheid,'' but
Cuban officials say they are trying to promote equality among
Cubans by not allowing special privileges to those with dollars
(sent by relatives in the United States or earned by working for
tourists).
</P>
<P>
   Dollars, however, are sometimes of no use in the face of
shortages. Meat and fresh vegetables can be hard to come by even at
better restaurants, and many items taste as if they were cooked in
lard.
</P>
<P>
   Havana has a wide range of restaurants and fast-food cafeterias,
and outside the capital most hotels have restaurants, all catering
to the dollar-carrying customer.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of service varies wildly, with hotel staffs ranging
from efficient and friendly to slow and surly. Worn-out carpets and
mismatched furniture can be found in some of the highly rated
hotels in Havana, such as the Capri, and hourslong power outages
are not uncommon. One hotel in Matanzas, near Varadero, shuts off
the water for most of the day.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Varadero's luxury resorts, the product of
government joint ventures with private companies from countries
such as Spain, Germany and Canada, seem like a step into the First
World. Almost everything is imported, from fruits and meats to
tools, and the feeling is one of pampered comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba is relatively cheap; the most expensive hotels often charge
less than $200 a night, depending on the season. Prices can be even
lower if a visitor sidesteps the government infrastructure and
deals directly with Cuban solo entrepreneurs. Unauthorized drivers,
for instance, charge much less than metered taxis, although many of
the cars are not air-conditioned and some seem to be falling apart.
Lodging with a family and taking meals at ``paladares'' _ private
restaurants in the owners' homes _ can offer higher quality at
lower prices than hotels and bigger restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And because of a thriving black market, it is possible to get
Cuban cigars at bargain prices. (Almost every Cuban one encounters
claims to know somebody at a cigar factory, but the product can be
junk, and tourists are often warned to buy tobacco only at
government stores.)
</P>
<P>
   Before the communist revolution, Americans made up the largest
tourist bloc visiting Cuba. Now Canadians and Europeans have filled
the void. Tourism, which the government began building up in the
1990s, has steadily increased to 1.4 million visitors in 1998,
according to officials of Cuba's tourism ministry. If an ambitious
target of 2 million visitors by the year 2000 is reached, they
said, Cuba will have nearly doubled its tourism since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're bringing more tourists and the tourism infrastructure is
also growing,'' said Manuel Garcia-Crespo, a tourism spokesman. The
infrastructure is key at this point for an industry that is still
in its infancy but that has become the largest source of foreign
currency for Cuba, contributing about $1.8 billion a year to the
island's economy, officials said. To accommodate the 2 million
visitors Cuba hopes to attract at the turn of the century, it needs
to increase hotel rooms to 34,000 from the current 28,000,
Garcia-Crespo said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the earliest and biggest private investors in Cuba's
tourism industry is Spain's Sol Melia hotel chain, which co-owns
four upscale hotels with the government and manages several others;
its investment on the island surpasses $55 million. Carlos
Pereda-Navarro, general manager of Melia Las Americas in Varadero,
considers Cuba an attractive investment because of government
support and the potential for growth. He said that more than
compensated for such extra costs as having to import most goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just beginning,'' said Pereda-Navarro, who has worked in
Cuba for the past nine years. The potential would be even greater,
he added, if Americans were free to travel to the island.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia-Crespo said American travel was up but still relatively
negligible.
</P>
<P>
   Under regulations enforced by the Department of the Treasury's
Office of Foreign Assets Control, travel to Cuba without a specific
license is generally limited to government officials and
representatives of international organizations, journalists and
those visiting close relatives. (Cuban-Americans on family visits
make up the largest group of visiting Americans, numbering about
30,000 a year, U.S. government figures show.)
</P>
<P>
   Since American carriers do not fly to Cuba, travelers usually go
through third countries like Mexico, Canada and the Bahamas, though
since last year many have been able to depart from Miami on
authorized charter flights that reach Havana in about 40 minutes.
In new steps announced this month, the Clinton administration said
it would authorize charter flights from additional U.S. cities to
destinations in Cuba other than Havana.
</P>
<P>
   For those traveling legally, there is a limit of $100 worth of
goods such as cigars and rum brought back from Cuba. Because
transactions are in cash _ Americans cannot use credit cards issued
by American banks _ visitors often go over the spending limit with
little risk of being caught. And Cuba enables illegal travel by
waiving boating fees at marinas and not stamping passports at
airports.
</P>
<P>
   American officials say a big problem is illegal travel through
third countries where weekend tour packages in Cuba are commonly
offered. Also, they say, some U.S.-based organizations make travel
possible under the guise of educational or cultural trips that are
mostly tours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The policy is no tourism,'' an American official who spoke on
the condition of anonymity said. ``There are people who violate the
law and a lot of people in the travel industry who promote this.''
</P>
<P>
   Although sailing to Cuba itself is not prohibited, paying for
meals, transportation, lodging and mooring fees is, and returning
passengers by air or vessel can be the subject of investigation by
the U.S. Customs Service, federal officials said. While enforcement
has been lax, officials say it has become progressively easier over
the years for the government to penalize people for violations. In
1992 civil fines of up to $55,000 for each violation were
instituted. The presumption is that a U.S. citizen traveling to
Cuba has spent money there unless he can prove otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal penalties for violating the travel restrictions are up
to 10 years in prison and $250,000 in fines for an individual.
There have been only 16 criminal prosecutions for Cuba travel
violations under the Trading With the Enemy Act since 1983,
officials said. But the Treasury Department has collected nearly
$1.9 million in civil penalties for embargo violations in 379
separate cases over the last four years as of last September, most
related to travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result is, this can ruin your vacation,'' the American
official said. The U.S. Interests Section, the American diplomatic
mission in Havana, does not refuse consular services such as
replacing a lost passport to Americans traveling here illegally
(unless the American was born in Cuba, in which case Cuba treats
the person as a national and does not allow the Interests Section
to get involved). But the diplomatic mission would also refer the
case to Treasury for enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. government officials said their policy responds to concerns
that override the desire American tourists may have to visit Cuba.
``We're trying to get Cuba to make the reforms needed to avoid a
chaotic transition when Castro falls, that would create a massive
migrant wave,'' the American official said. But American officials
also acknowledge that people almost invariably become more
conciliatory toward Cuba, and opposed to the embargo, once they
visit. ``It creates a constituency,'' the American official said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who flout the law say they do not care about
politics. ``People can come over, go out fishing and have a good
time and it doesn't cost them a fortune,'' said the boater from Key
West at Marina Hemingway, where boats from 30 to 50 feet long sport
satellite dishes and American flags and sometimes anchor for months
at a time. The American said he stood ready to defend his rights in
court if ever prosecuted, arguing that it is unconstitutional for
the United States to restrict Americans' right to travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Americans come here basically because it's a
beautiful country,'' he said.

 LIGHTS OVER MANITOBA  
 BRAZIL'S DEPARTURE TAXES  
 STEIFF MENAGERIE  
 
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 31) 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I understand there are tours to Churchill, Manitoba, to view
the northern lights. Do you have information on tours given in
March or April? _ Shirley U. Miller, New York, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. Churchill, on the western shore of Hudson Bay, affords
visitors the chance to marvel at nature's wonders day and night.
</P>
<P>
   The best months to see the northern lights _ the aurora borealis
_ are November through April when the nights are long, and the best
time of the month is the new moon, according to Roger Woloshyn, an
instructor at the Churchill Northern Studies Center.
</P>
<P>
   For those who would like to see Churchill's other attractions,
October and November is when polar bears gather on the shores of
Hudson Bay to wait for it to freeze so they can head out and hunt
seal. And June to August is the season for observing beluga whales.
</P>
<P>
   The northern lights are luminous displays seen in such forms as
curtains, streamers, rays and patches. They dance across the sky
often starting as greenish white and sometimes having a red edge or
a green or blue tinge.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Churchill an excellent site for viewing the lights,
Woloshyn said, is that it is directly under the aurora and
accessible to travelers. (It's about 600 miles from Winnipeg, and
can be reached by air or rail, but not by car.)
</P>
<P>
   In describing what causes the northern lights, Woloshyn said
solar particles, mostly high-energy electrons, are drawn along the
Earth's magnetic field. They strike air molecules, transferring
energy to them and cause gases to glow just as neon in a tube glows
when electricity flows through it.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, tour groups that view the lights are driven to the
outskirts of Churchill and beyond in a Tundra Buggy, which has
wheels 10 feet high as protection from overly curious polar bears,
or taken to the domed observatory of the Churchill Northern Studies
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Each winter before and after the new moon, five-day classes are
given at the center, a year-round scientific center 14 miles east
of Churchill. Information: Post Office Box 610, Churchill, Manitoba
R0B 0E0; (204) 675-2307, fax (204) 675-2139.
 &UR;  &LR;  Travelers taking tours with companies based in Canada are charged
a 7 percent goods and services tax, half of which is refundable.
Some companies rebate half the tax to non-Canadians up front to
spare them the bother of filling out a refund form.
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies with northern light tours in March and April
are these, with rates based on double occupancy, are these:
</P>
<P>
   Aurora Tours, Box 355, RPO South St. Vital, Winnipeg Manitoba
R2N 3X9, (204) 942-6617. Tours start and end in Churchill, with the
remaining dates being March 12 to 15 and April 16 to 19. The price
is $488 (at 66 Canadian cents to the United States dollar) plus 7
percent tax. Meals are not included.
 &UR;  &LR; Natural Habitat Adventures, 2945 Center Green Court South,
Boulder, Colo. 80301; (800) 543-8917 or (303) 449-3711, fax (303)
449-3712. Date: March 14 to 20, with first and last nights spent in
Winnipeg. Cost: $2,395.
</P>
<P>
   Operators of aurora borealis tours during the rest of the year
include &UR;  &LR; the Great Canadian Travel Co., 273 Donald Street,
Winnipeg, Canada R3C 1M9, (204) 949-0199, fax (204) 949-0188. It
has a trip from Nov. 11 to 18, with the first and last nights spent
in Winnipeg. Cost: $1,491 plus 7 percent tax, half of which is
rebated up front.
</P>
<P>
   Q. While getting ready to fly back to New York from Rio de
Janeiro, I found it absurd that the Brazilian government charged
$36 per person for departure taxes. How does this compare with
other countries? Robert Fucs, New Milford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   A. With the devaluation of Brazil's currency on Jan. 13, the
picture has darkened for Brazilians and brightened for visitors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By late January, the value of the real had dropped about 30
percent. So while the tax remains 40 Brazilian reias on
international flights, it has fallen to the equivalent of about
$25.
</P>
<P>
   The revenue the tax generates is used for modernization and
maintenance of Brazil's airports, according to Renato Mosca, head
of the press section at Brazilian Embassy in Washington. One such
project, he said, was the building several years ago of a new
international airport, Guarulhos, outside Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that a departure tax also applies to domestic flights,
Mosca said it was Brazilians who shouldered most of the burden of
the departure tax. The tax, for example, on a 90-minute flight from
his hometown, Ribeirao Preto, to Sao Paolo, is about $5.60, taking
devaluation into account. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many countries do, indeed, have lower departure taxes or other
fees for departing international flights. But with the devaluation,
Brazil's tax is similar to that of its neighbors: Venezuela charges
$29, Ecuador $25 and Argentina $23.50.
</P>
<P>
   Some fees elsewhere: $18 in France and Japan, $9 in Italy and
$6.45 in Hong Kong _ all of which vary, of course, depending on the
exchange rate. In Britain, for example, it's 20 pounds, which is
about $33, based on 60 pence to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Q. My 10-year-old granddaughter is an avid collector of Steiff
stuffed animals. I would like to take her to the factory in Giengen
an der Brenz in Germany. Can you help? _ Mary T. George,
Tallahassee, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A. The factory is not open to the public, but a museum in the
same town _ displaying old and new animals, dolls, wooden toys and
memorabilia _ is. And there is the inevitable modern touch _ a
video, about the company's traditions, which include stitching the
last seam by hand. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The company's origins date from 1890, when Margarete Steiff
began making stuffed elephants. Seven years later her nephew
Richard Steiff, who was taken with bears, started making the bears
that became synonymous with the Steiff name.
</P>
<P>
   They are still going strong: Of the million and a half animals
made each year (with the trademark button in the ear), 350,000 are
bears.
</P>
<P>
   The Margarete Steiff Museum is at 2 Alleenstrasse; the telephone
number is (49) 7322-131-1, fax (49) 7322-0131-475. Open Monday to
Friday, 1 to 4 p.m.; Saturday, 8:30 a.m. to noon. On the first
Saturday of the month the hours are 8:30 to 4 p.m. Admission is
free.
</P>
<P>
   Giengen an der Brenz, a town of 20,000 people in southern
Germany, is 20 miles northeast of Ulm. The nearest airport of note
is in Stuttgart, about 75 miles away.

CRUISE LINES' MANTRA: MORE, MORE, MORE 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 31) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., La., Mass., Va., Wash., Calif., Texas, Alaska,
Hawaii) ( nk ) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   During the Persian Gulf war almost a decade ago, cruise lines
hastily improvised alternative itineraries while moving their ships
as fast and as far away from the war zone as possible. Within days,
the Mediterranean was being referred to in cruising circles as the
Dead Sea. But last month's bombing of Iraq by the United States and
Britain created scarcely a ripple.
</P>
<P>
   This time most ships had already moved from the Mediterranean to
the Caribbean for the start of the winter cruise season, and the
sustained bombing of Iraq lasted only a few days. If peace
prevails, a record number of cruise ships are expected in the
Mediterranean and elsewhere in Europe this year. And if the economy
cooperates, the number of passengers taking cruises is likely to
increase for a 10th consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even taking into account the recent stock market
jitters, a recent forecast by cruise analysts at Bear, Stearns &AMP;
Co. estimates this year's passenger growth at 10 to 11 percent. If
that turns out to be the case, that would put the number of
passengers at about six million _ and within hailing distance of
the seven million passengers in 2000 forecast by the Cruise Lines
International Association.
</P>
<P>
   Still unclear is what effect the several setbacks last year will
have on the industry this year. These included a fire aboard
Carnival's Ecstasy last summer (in which there were no casualties),
the Monarch of the Seas' striking a reef in St. Maarten harbor in
mid-December and having to cancel 12 cruises (she is scheduled to
resume sailing March 14) and postponement of the inaugural voyage
of the Disney Wonder, Disney's second ship, from March to Aug. 15,
toward the end of the traditional summer cruise season. (Delivery
of the first Disney ship, the Disney Magic, was postponed twice
last year, forcing cancellation of 40 cruises.)
</P>
<P>
   The industry was also shaken by two recent articles in The New
York Times. The first, published in November, examined the growing
concern about crime _ particularly allegations of sexual assaults
by crew members _ aboard cruise ships, which operate largely
outside the laws of any one country. The second, published early
this month, detailed how Royal Caribbean knowingly broke the law by
dumping oily waste into the ocean, then argued (to no avail) that a
private company doing business in the United States was immune from
criminal prosecution because its ships fly foreign flags.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were six months of bad news,'' said Michael Driscoll,
editor of Cruise Week, which is widely read by travel agents. ``The
industry is worried, and I'm curious to see what impact that will
have on the cruise business this year.''
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, passengers continue to give cruising high
marks. And many travel agents, who collectively book more than 90
percent of all cruises, have vowed to redouble efforts to sell even
more berths, to offset income lost by the latest round of
commission caps imposed by the airlines last November.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the popularity of each new big ship seems to
confirm the decision by cruise line officials to compete with
resorts, amusement parks, beach towns and ski resorts. Most new big
ships, for example, have elegant restaurants and boutiques, luxury
spas, high-tech fitness rooms, water slides, conference and meeting
rooms, theaters featuring large-cast productions, pubs, playrooms
and computer rooms, as well as casinos as glitzy as some in Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   And there is more to come. Royal Caribbean's 142,000-ton Voyager
of the Seas, scheduled for delivery this fall, will have a
full-sized basketball court and ice-skating rink, a rock-climbing
wall, a minigolf course, a theater five decks high, a $1 million
sea-water aquarium, a wedding chapel and the world's biggest
roulette wheel. The Cunard Line's first new ship in about 30 years,
tentatively promised in about 2002, will have many of the above
amenities plus a microbrewery and the world's biggest maritime
museum.
</P>
<P>
   Because cruise ships have not yet figured out how to equip their
vessels with actual golf courses, Crystal's Symphony and Harmony
have a total of nine cruises this year ranging from 11 to 16 days
that provide guaranteed tee times at 21 notable golf courses in the
Mediterranean, the British Isles, Central America and the
Caribbean. (The first cruise was scheduled to sail Jan. 25; the
remainder, including six aboard the Symphony, will sail beginning
Aug. 10.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, many cruise passengers prefer smaller ships, including
ones still in the fleets of Carnival, Princess and Royal Caribbean,
the three cruise lines that have led the big-ship boom. Holland
America's largest ships, including three scheduled for delivery by
next year, do not exceed about 1,400 passengers. Crystal's three
ships carry about 850 passengers, while Renaissance Cruises plans
to build five 690-passenger ships in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Silverseas Cruises is building two ships of 290 passengers,
while Radisson Seven Seas, only one of whose five ships carries
more than 320 passengers, plans to add four more by 2004. Its
320-passenger Paul Gauguin, which went into service last year in
French Polynesia, had a 90 percent year-round occupancy, an
especially high percentage for a first-year operation and doubly so
for a luxury ship with luxury prices. All three Seabourn luxury
ships have a capacity of just 204 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Other small-ship cruise lines including Windstar, American
Canadian Caribbean, Windjammer Barefoot Cruises, Classical Cruises
and Clipper Cruise Line offer wide-ranging itineraries for the
growing niche markets. Classical's 48-passenger Halcyon, for
example, is offering the first and only cruise dedicated to
Tunisia, from the Mediterranean to the Sahara, while the
122-passenger Clipper Adventurer will tour both the ``bottom of the
world,'' including Antarctica, South Georgia and the Falklands, and
the ``top of the world,'' including Greenland, the Arctic and
Maritime Canada. Linblad Special Expeditions, a pioneer in
out-of-the-way cruising, is offering year-round 10-day voyages from
Guayaquil, Ecuador, to the Galapagos Islands aboard the
80-passenger Polaris.

   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ If nothing else, the Mighty Ducks are
creatures of habit. Once again they entered the NHL All-Star break
with a sub-.500 record.
</P>

   But unlike last year, there is reason for optimism. The Ducks,
who in their history are a total of 35 games under .500 before the

   The Ducks are two games under .500 (17-19-9), but that is three
games better than '96-97 when the team made its only trip to the
playoffs. It's an improvement of eight games from last year when
they went on to finish 26-43-13.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks are tied for fifth in the Western Conference with 43
points, even though they had their share of ups and downs,
including a six-game unbeaten streak and a five-game winless
streak.
</P>
<P>
   Predicted by many to be one of the worst teams in the league,
Anaheim has showed signs it might be capable of repeating the kind
of play that saw it post a combined 38-24-11 record after All-Star
breaks in '95-96 and '96-97.
</P>
<P>
   From the first day of training camp, stability has reigned, not
chaos.
</P>
<P>
   There were no holdouts. One man (Pierre Gauthier) has been in
charge of the hockey operations since former president Tony Tavares
stepped down and general manager Jack Ferreira was fired.
Meanwhile, new coach Craig Hartsburg simply demands hard work and
commitment, and hasn't confused the players by changing systems
every other week, as was the case with Pierre Page.
</P>
<P>
   The stability has also led to a more relaxed atmosphere in a
dressing room that appears to house a group of players who seem to
enjoy each other.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans Kevin Haller, Jim McKenzie and Stu Grimson _ acquired
by Ferreira _ have provided some much-needed leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Other keys so far have been:
</P>
<P>
   __ The dramatic improvement of the special teams. Historically,
the Ducks have been one of the NHL's worst when it came to
special-teams play. This year, both the power play (fifth) and
penalty killing (ninth) are in the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   __ The return to form of Paul Kariya and Guy Hebert. Kariya,
after playing only 22 games last season, is fully recovered from
his concussion and is leading the league in scoring with 62 points.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert wasn't named an All-Star, but he has played like one
(.928 save percentage, four shutouts) and he usually gets better in
the second half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Last but certainly not least is the tremendous improvement in
team defense. Anaheim's group of no-name defensemen (i.e. Jason
Marshall, Haller, Jaime Pushor, Ruslan Salei) have helped turn
around a team that last year gave up 3.2 goals a game. This season,
the Ducks are allowing only 2.4 per game.
</P>
<P>
   But as Hartsburg often points out, the Ducks have a long, long
way to go before they reach their potential. There are areas that
obviously need to be improved on.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks can't rely on their power play and their top line all
the time. They have been outscored at even strength by eight goals
and desperately need a consistent second line to take some of the
pressure off Kariya, Teemu Selanne and Steve Rucchin. The
performances of Tomas Sandstrom, Marty McInnis, Travis Green and
Matt Cullen will be crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim has already won 12 games at the Pond, one more game than
it won at home all last season. The Ducks, however, must prove they
can survive on the road, where they are only 5-11-5.
</P>
<P>
   Quality playoff teams turn in a consistent effort night after
night, and no matter how much Hartsburg preaches, his words have
sometimes fallen upon deaf ears. The Ducks can't afford
embarrassing no-effort performances like the one that resulted in a
recent loss to Calgary at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of McInnis was crucial, but Gauthier needs to
find the Ducks one more veteran defenseman for the season's final
push. That player should be one who can pass the puck well and join
the attack on occasion to take the pressure off the forwards.
Fredrik Olausson has 10 goals already, but the other six defensemen
on the current roster have combined for only three.

<P>
   The Caribbean (including Bermuda, which is really in the
Atlantic) remains the most popular cruise destination, attracting
46.2 percent of the market. But its share has fallen from 50.5
percent in 1996, in part because the industry has expanded its
range and itineraries, while the combined share of European and
Caribbean cruises has climbed steadily into second place with 19.6
percent, followed by Alaska with 8.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 cruise lines will sail the Mediterranean and
elsewhere in Europe this year, some of them from April to November,
about a month longer than in most other years. Celebrity will visit
the Mediterranean for the first time, its 1,750-passenger Century
sailing 11-night to 14-night cruises between April and October.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans who choose European cruises have previously
sailed the Caribbean, often several times, and readily pay fares 35
to 40 percent higher than for Caribbean cruises of comparable
length. Most of them seek the rich cultural mix readily available
in European ports or through land packages sold by the cruise
ships.
</P>
<P>
   While often criticized as overpriced, the land packages have
made more of Europe available to more cruise passengers. Princess,
for example, is enhancing its seven 12-day Mediterranean sailings
this year with pre- and postcruise tours covering Germany, Austria
and Switzerland; Paris, Bordeaux and the Loire Valley, and Italy
and the Swiss Alps, including Venice, Milan, St. Moritz, the
Matterhorn, Montreux and Geneva. Classical Cruises' 12-day
Mediterranean cruise, departing Lisbon on April 11, has a two-night
precruise package tour of Lisbon and a two-night postcruise
extension in Athens. Orient Lines and Costa Cruises also have
extensive Mediterranean cruises and land packages.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska, too, is drawing more passengers. The number of
passengers expected to sail on cruises in Alaska is 568,000, up
from 373,000 in 1994. This year Holland America and Princess
Cruises, the industry leaders, will each sail six ships to Alaska,
with 118 and 104 departures respectively, one more than their
combined total of 221 last year last year. Norwegian Cruise Line's
two ships in Alaska this year will depart from Vancouver, as do
most cruise ships, but next year its Norwegian Sky, currently under
construction, will become the first big ship with regular cruises
to depart from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen small ships will also sail to or within Alaska this
year, including seven from Alaska Sightseeing/Cruise West and two
12-passenger ships from Alaska Yacht Safaris. Although Holland
America's Noordam will start the large-ship parade north when she
departs Vancouver May 7, three small ships will depart in April.
The first of those, Alaska Sightseeing's Spirit of Glacier Bay,
will set sail April 10 on an 11-day Seattle to Juneau cruise.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, while southern Florida remains the home port for most
major cruise lines, occasional or seasonal cruises are steadily
increasing from a variety of other ports. Celebrity will have 11
cruises this spring and summer from Charleston and Newport News,
Va., and will replace its Celebration in Tampa, Fla., with the
2,600-passenger Carnival Sensation, which will sail weekly to Grand
Cayman, Playa del Carmen, Cozumel and New Orleans. The Norwegian
Majesty will sail from Boston to St. George, Bermuda, every Sunday
from April 11 through Oct. 17, while the Norwegian Sea is offering
year-round seven-day cruises from Houston to Cancun, Cozumel and
Roatan, a Bay Island off the coast of Honduras. One or more major
cruise ships will also sail this season from New York, New Orleans,
Galveston, Texas, Honolulu, Palm Beach, Fla., and San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   For passengers within driving distance of those ``satellite
ports,'' such cruises can be a great convenience. For the cruise
lines, which are not likely to loosen their ties to south Florida
anytime soon, they are a way to generate interest in cruising among
the estimated 89 percent of American adults who, according to Bear,
Stearns, have not yet signed on.

 &HT;    City braces for the Pontiff
 &HT;    By Charlise Lyles
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The pope who exudes a general holiness has taken
hold of this Midwestern city from the Catholic Basilica to Baptists
and evangelical churches, Muslim mosques and Jewish temples. When
Pople John Paul II arrives here today for a 30-hour visit on his
way back to the Vatican from Mexico City, a spirit of interfaith
understanding and ecumenism will welcome him.
</P>
<P>
   It is a reply, clergy and others say, to the 78-year-old
pontiff's continuing historic efforts to reach out to other faiths.
He is, they say, the all-inclusive pope.
</P>
<P>
   Because of John Paul's open-mindedness toward other faiths, St.
Louis Rabbi Robert Jacobs says he will make history Wednesday when
the rabbi enters the cathedral for a vespers service.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the first time in history that a rabbi has ever
taken a part in a Catholic liturgy and prayer,'' said Jacobs. ``I
have received telephone calls from a newspaper in Jerusalem asking
me why I as a Jew would participate in a Catholic litugy.''
</P>
<P>
   His answer is that in 1986 in Rome, Pope John Paul II becme the
first of 264 popes throughout history to enter a synagogue. ``He
sat on a platform with two chairs, side by side with a local rabbi,
`` said Jacobs. ``This is remarkable because protocol would require
that he sit above them. Because of behavoir like this he has a
remarkable appeal to the Jewish people.''
</P>
<P>
   Muslim Imam Waheed Rana also plans to attend the service,
dressed in his customary Islamic robes. ``This is a once in a
lifetime celebration and we want to be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope ``has done very much to build bridges between faith
communities,'' said Rana. ``He has called many times Muslims to the
Vatican, people such as Ahmad Sakr, who is a Muslim leader from
Egypt, and they have been very impressed with his approach to
talking with people of other faiths.''
</P>
<P>
   Rana said, however, that Muslims are not likely to be a part of
today's crowd along the papal route from the archbishop of St.
Louis' residence to the Kiel Center, where the pope will conclude a
youth rally with prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Adams of the American Baptist Association believes that
Baptists will be in the crowd. ``There won't be many,'' he said.
``Those who come will come out of respect. There's no hostility
anymore like there was when Baptists and Catholics used to throw
rocks at each other.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II is expected to arrive about 1 p.m. today and he
will meet with President Clinton about 1:45 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The agencies in this city of 380,000 people have put on a united
front pull off the pontiff's visit here, which will culminate in
two days of extraordinary measures and precautions that include:
</P>
<P>
   Closing St. Louis public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Repaving 95 percent of downtown streets.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly doubling hospital emergency room staffs to handle up to
five times more patients than normal.
</P>
<P>
   Calling in 60 law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Purchasing $400,000 worth of sophisticated antiterrorism
equipment designed to detect bombs as well as chemical and
biological hazards.
</P>
<P>
   Placing 1,000 portable potties on side streets.
</P>
<P>
   City officials estimate the pontiff's visit, which is expected
to draw up to 1 million people, will bring at least $25 million in
revenues. They disclose no estimates on how much the pontiff's
visit has cost the city.
</P>
<P>
   At the Archdiocese of St. Louis offices on Lindell Boulevard,
which is part of today's papal route, the Rev. Vincent Heier said
he is praying that the pope's visit will inspire a united effort to
confront the city's ``urban problems,'' such as urban sprawl and
chilly race relations, problems that Dayton also faces. About 45
percent of St. Louis residents are black.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Holy Father addresses issues like racism and unjust
treatment of the poor, these are certainly messages we definately
need to hear locally,'' said Heier.
</P>
<P>
   At a deli on Fourth Street, just blocks away from the TransWorld
Dome, where the pope will conduct Mass Wednesday, Tony Montgomery
said that as a black Catholic he feels embraced by the pope's love
of humanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very universal,'' said Mongomery, a 42-year-old software
trainer. ``He is not the black pope. He is not the white pope. He
encompasses all people, all religions, all beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   But indifference, even pessimism, toward the pope could also be
found on Fourth Street. The visit will do little to inspire those
who have left the church, said Justin T. Sims, 24, who grew up
Catholic but is no longer active in the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sounds crass but he's an old guy who lives in Italy. He's
basically a figurehead. Some say he's God's conduit. Maybe I missed
something, but I don't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reginia Hill, 43, of Sacred Heart parish in Omaha, Neb., gets
it. After Sunday morning Mass, Hill's priest handed her a ticket
for Wednesday's Mass. She called her boss and asked for emergency
vacation, then drove hours to reach St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Poppa comes this far,'' she said, ``you just have to go.
</P>

 &HT;    Chandler still answering critics
 &HT;    By Ethan J. Skolnick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Chris Chandler leaned forward to hear the question,
revealing an island of scalp suggesting he'd left follicles in
Indianapolis, and Tampa Bay, and St. Louis, and Phoenix, and
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you comfortable with the underdog role?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any role,'' the Falcons quarterback replied, then half-sung to
himself. ''Call me anything. Just call me.''
</P>
<P>
   The words were a combination twist on lyrics by Sting and Paul
Simon, Tracy Chapman and the Carpenters, and Chandler realized his
melody didn't fit any of the above. Just like he didn't fit in five
NFL cities before coming to Atlanta in 1997. He was more hunchback
than quarterback, shunned in favor of Jeff George, Vinny
Testaverde, Steve Beuerlein, Chris Miller and Steve McNair.
</P>
<P>
   ''It happened in Indianapolis,'' Chandler said of the
disbelievers. ''To a certain degree it happened in Phoenix, and
then it happened again in Houston. It's kind of hard when you keep
going through those things, but it's nice to be in a situation
where I don't have to worry about that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Nice? Chandler's coach, Dan Reeves, trusts the 33-year-old
enough to have given him a four-year, $25 million extension. The
press has stopped calling him ``Chrystal Chandelier,'' a reference
to his former fragility. Many personnel gurus who discarded him
have been discarded themselves. The Falcons, 7-3 when he started
and finished last year, are 15-1 with him starting this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I walked up to him before the Jets game and I told him, 'If
Chris don't play, Jamal will pay,''' running back Jamal Anderson
said of a game Chandler missed. ''The record speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   He has thrown 24 touchdowns in the red zone without an
interception. He was the league's best quarterback in the fourth
quarter, and Steve Young is the only other passer with a 95 rating
each of the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Chris Chandler is the best quarterback in the game
right now,'' said Steve Bartkowski, who quarterbacked Atlanta from
1975 to 1985. ''I don't think there's another guy who can make all
the throws with such uncanny accuracy. Chris puts it in a crack it
doesn't fit in.''
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps, in his 11th season, Chandler has made a crack in
public perception. Perhaps he's more than an embittered journeyman
whose father-in-law and golfing partner is former Niners
quarterback John Brodie, whose brother-in-law of Larry Stefanki,
coach of Marcelo Rios. Perhaps there's a reason he's in the Super
Bowl, while another former University of Washington great, Warren
Moon, is here to commentate.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps he is a sign that you don't need a great quarterback.
In the 1990's, the Super Bowl quarterbacks have been John Elway,
Brett Favre, Drew Bledsoe, Jim Kelly, Neil O'Donnell, Stan
Humphries, Young, Troy Aikman, Mark Rypien, Jeff Hostetler and Joe
Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Six are likely Hall of Famers. Bledsoe's close. Rypien had a
superb season. Hostetler was pressed into duty when Phil Simms was
hurt. O'Donnell and Humphries were driven there by strong defenses
and running games.
</P>
<P>
   Their teams lost.
</P>
<P>
   So who is wrong? Those who say you need a great quarterback, or
those who say Chandler isn't one?
</P>
<P>
   Chandler bristles at comparisons between he and Elway: ''I don't
really care about a lot of things, and that's one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Not like he cared about how the league treated him. His worst
experience?
</P>
<P>
   ''Tampa.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tampa Bay.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers traded a first-round pick to the Colts to get
Chandler in 1990, two years after the third-rounder started 13
games as an Indianapolis rookie. Chandler injured his knee in 1989,
prompting the Colts to draft George.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay already had a starter: Testaverde. Chandler played
terribly, and was released in 1992. He signed with the Cardinals,
where he met Jerry Rhome, an assistant who wore the stubborn
quarterback down and became his mentor. ''If it wasn't for Rock
teaching me all that stuff, I'd be in a cheese line somewhere,''
Chandler said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Chandler was passed in line by free agent Beuerlein, so he
signed with the Rams, starting six games in 1993. He signed with
the Oilers in 1995, and had two solid years, though he was just a
seat-warmer. ''It was an uncomfortable, strange situation to be in
with them drafting Steve McNair and what was inevitably going to
happen _ playing him,'' Chandler said.
</P>
<P>
   To replace George and Bobby Hebert, Reeves, sent fourth and
sixth round picks to the Oilers for Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could trade for a quarterback, live with his contract and
still do something defensively,'' Reeves said. ''Trading for him
was really a key because we were able to move down in the draft and
really pick up the draft choices we lost for him and still get some
good players. I liked Chris from what I saw on film. Rennie
Simmons, who is on our staff, had been with him in Houston and
really liked him. He said the only thing is that he will miss some
games with injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson thought little of the acquisition, until he saw
Chandler practice. ''Me and (receiver) Terance (Mathis) were
sitting around thinking, how did this guy land here for a
fourth-round pick?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know,'' Chandler said. ''Sometimes people are wrong on
decisions they make on players. I got on a pretty good roll of
being with people who were wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   These days he's on a pretty good roll. Period. His wife Diane
gave birth to a third daughter, Brynn Brodie, last Wednesday. They
will arrive Friday, to watch him in a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been able to stay _ knock on wood _ healthier,''
offensive coordinator George Sefcik said. ''He's an accurate long
thrower, he's extremely sharp with audibles, getting you to the
right play, and he's having a hot year. I think a lot of it has to
do with the people around you.''
</P>
<P>
   Their talent, and their faith in him.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the years went by, I thought maybe that will never be the
case for me,'' Chandler said.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has a case to make.
</P>

   That's good news for us as we follow four adult ridleys on their
dangerous journey from the Padre Island National Seashore, where
they laid their eggs, to the Gulf of Mexico, where they forage and
rest before the journey back.
</P>
<P>
   It's also good news for biologist Donna Shaver and her ongoing
turtle study at the U.S. Department of the Interior. The signals
tell her how the creatures survive the winter, and what humans can
do to help them.
</P>
<P>
   Ridleys are the most endangered of the seven sea turtle species
that have swum in the world's oceans for 180 million years.
Scientists believe only 3,000 of them exist.
</P>
<P>
   Ridleys are the smallest of the species, growing 24 to 28 inches
long and weighing between 77 and 100 pounds. Leatherback turtles
can grow as large as an adult man.
</P>
<P>
   While the other species crawl ashore at night to lay their eggs,
ridleys nest during the day. While the others are found worldwide,
ridleys prefer the Gulf of Mexico. And ridleys are the only sea
turtles named for a person. The first part is for Richard Kemp, who
helped discover them. ``Ridley'' is from the word ``riddle,''
because no one knew where they nested.
</P>
<P>
   THE RIDLEY REPORT
</P>
<P>
   The Mother's Day Mom was last seen on the Padre Island National
Seashore, where she came ashore May 10, laid a clutch of eggs, then
disappeared into the Gulf of Mexico. She swam as far as the western
coast of Florida before the contact abruptly stopped in October.
</P>
<P>
   Biologist Shaver worried because the turtle faces so many
enemies in the open sea: cold water, boat propellers, shrimp nets,
sharks. But the signals started up again Jan. 5, and the hope is
she will survive the winter and return to Padre Island in the
spring.
</P>
<P>
   The Mother's Day Mom was one of four ridley turtles who left the
beach with transmitters. The bad news is one of the four has
vanished.
</P>
<P>
   The last time anyone saw her was April 21. She had crawled onto
the wild stretch of beach and laid 93 eggs. Then 86 of her babies
waddled into the sea two months later. She was in waters off
Florida when the signals stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst-case scenario is that she succumbed, but it's
probably more likely that something went wrong with the
transmitter,'' said Shaver, who downloads the data in her lab on
Padre Island.
</P>
<P>
   Shaver says the two other ridleys with transmitters are behaving
like the Mother's Day Mom: hugging the shoreline, staying in
relatively warm and shallow water, and foraging on crabs.
</P>
<P>
   None has turned around yet. But when they do, Shaver will be
waiting. ``And that will be an exciting day,'' she says.

   Arribada: Spanish for ``arrival.'' Used to describe the
synchronized nesting of Kemp's ridley sea turtles

   Carapace: The upper shell made of bone
</P>
<P>
   Clutch: A nest of turtle eggs
</P>
<P>
   Natal beach: All sea turtles are hatched on land. Females are
known to return to the beach where they were born to lay their eggs
once they become adults.
</P>
<P>

   Facts:
</P>
<P>
   _ Largest sea turtle ever recorded: 10 feet long and 2,019
pounds, a leatherback
</P>
<P>
   _ Sea turtles are the heaviest aquatic reptile alive today.
</P>
<P>
   _ A sea turtle cannot bend its back; only its legs, neck and
tail can move, because its backbone and ribs are fused to its
shell.
</P>
<P>
   _ Though every sea turtle's life begins on land, sea turtles
spend almost their whole lives in water.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sea turtles were hunted to near extinction for their meat and
eggs for food, skin for leather, and beautiful scutes for jewelry,
as well as for manufacturing face cream, soaps, cosmetics and
tourist trinkets.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sea turtles do not have visible ears, but they have eardrums
covered with skin. Their underwater vision is good, but they are
nearsighted out of water. They have a great sense of smell.
</P>
<P>
   _ There is no way to determine a sea turtle's age just by
looking at it. It is believed that some species can live 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sea turtles do not have teeth, but they have ``beaks'' and
jaws that are specially formed to help them eat the food they like.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kemp's ridleys (Lepidochelys kempu)
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other sea turtles, Kemp's ridleys nest every year. Each
nest averages 105 eggs, and these incubate for 55 days.
</P>
<P>
   The largest known breeding site is in Mexico. By the 1970s, the
numbers were down to 702. A 10-year international program has
attempted to establish a second breeding colony at Padre Island
National Seashore.
</P>
<P>
   Man is a ridley's biggest enemy. The turtles are often drowned
in shrimpers' nets, wounded by boat propellers or robbed of their
eggs, which some cultures consider an aphrodisiac. Kemp's aquatic
enemies are primarily sharks and disease.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Loggerheads (Caretta caretta)
</P>
<P>
   Of all the sea turtles in the United States, this is the one
seen most often. Named for their exceptionally large heads, adult
loggerheads weigh up to 350 pounds. All the others are classified
as endangered, but loggerheads are listed as threatened, which
means they are more numerous but still in danger of extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Loggerheads are found throughout most of the world, as far south
as Argentina and as far north as Newfoundland. Nesting is primarily
in two areas of the world: the southeastern coast of the United
States and Masirah Island, Oman. The largest nesting in North
America takes place on Florida's Atlantic coast between Cape
Canaveral and Sebastian Inlet.
</P>
<P>
   Loggerheads have powerful jaws that allow them to crush
shellfish. They feed on horseshoe crabs, clams, mussels and other
invertebrates.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hawksbills (Eretmochelys imbricata)
</P>
<P>
   Hawksbills are endangered in large part because people kill them
for their beautiful shells, which are used to make jewelry.
Although they can be found in U.S. waters, they rarely nest there.
</P>
<P>
   Their narrow head and large beak look hawklike, and their jaws
are shaped like a beak so they can reach food in crevices in coral
reefs. They eat sponges, anemones, squid and shrimp. Hawksbills are
found around coral reefs, rocky areas and lagoons of the Atlantic,
Pacific and Indian oceans.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Leatherbacks (Dermochelys coriacea)
</P>
<P>
   Leatherbacks are also endangered, but a few nest on the east
coast of Florida each year. They grow the largest, dive the deepest
and travel the farthest of all sea turtles. Mature leatherbacks
reach 4 to 8 feet in length and weigh 600 to 1,300 pounds.
Leatherbacks approach the coastal waters only during breeding
season.
</P>
<P>
   They are the only sea turtles without a hard shell; theirs is
made instead of a skin that is tough, rubbery and looks like
leather. Leatherbacks have delicate, scissorlike jaws, so they feed
almost exclusively on jellyfish.
</P>
<P>
   Green and black turtles (Chelonia mydas mydas)
</P>
<P>
   Green turtles are an endangered species, but they are still
found in significant numbers on the east coast of Florida. They are
easily distinguishable from other species because they have a
single pair of scales in front of their eyes rather than two pairs,
as other sea turtles have. The largest nesting site in the Western
Hemisphere is at Tortuguero, Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   Green turtles and black turtles are the only herbivores. As
young turtles, they eat worms, young crustaceans and insects, as
well as grasses and algae. But when they mature, they use their
finely serrated jaws to tear vegetation, and they stick to sea
grass and algae.
</P>
<P>
   Green turtles are found all over, but they like the tropical
waters off Central America, the Bahamas and the United States.
Black turtles are found along the west coasts of North, South and
Central America from California to Peru.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Others
</P>
<P>
   Olive ridley: Olive ridleys live in tropical regions of the
Pacific, Indian and Atlantic oceans.
</P>
<P>
   Australian flatback: Australian flatbacks eat sea cucumbers,
jellyfish, mollusks, prawns and seaweed. Flatbacks have the most
restricted range, not venturing beyond Australia's continental
shelf.

 &HT;    Big Play Ray no Broadway Joe
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The most famous Super Bowl line ever was uttered less
than a mile from where he was sitting Monday night and yet Ray
Buchanan _ for all his attempt at boast and bravado on the
championship stage _ proved nothing but a pale imitation of the
past.
</P>
<P>
   They may call him Big Play Ray, but he's still no Broadway Joe.
</P>
<P>
   One man's history is but another guy's hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a fun thing, it wasn't meant as a slap at
Denver,'' the Atlanta Falcons cornerback said of his
nationally-televised victory prediction five days ago.
</P>
<P>
   After some prompting during an interview last Thursday on HBO's
``Inside the NFL,'' Buchanan _ shrugging off the fact his Falcons
are 7-point underdogs to the Denver Broncos in Sunday's Super Bowl
XXXIII _ said he ``guaranteed'' an Atlanta victory.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as you stood next to him at the Falcons' team hotel and
heard him backpedal on his promise, it was as you expected. His
words had none of the anger, the gall or the conviction that Joe
Namath did when he was goaded into dropping his famed Super Bowl
bombshell 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was a few days before the powerful, Don Shula-coached
Baltimore Colts were to meet Weeb Ewbank's New York Jets _ upstarts
from the American Football League and 19-point underdogs _ in Super
Bowl III at the Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Namath, the Jets' 25-year-old quarterback, was being honored by
the Miami Touchdown Club at a gathering in Miami Springs and that's
when a heckler in the back of the room began yelling how the Jets
would be trounced by the NFL Colts.
</P>
<P>
   Grabbing the microphone and pointing to the heckler, Namath
said, ``The Jets are going to beat the Baltimore Colts and win the
championship of all of football. I guarantee it.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd thought he was nuts. In the first two Super Bowls, NFL
teams had blown out the AFL teams. But Namath was undaunted and
that riled Colts players all the more.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should keep his mouth shut,'' groused Baltimore defensive
lineman Billy Ray Smith. ``He'll keep his teeth longer.''
</P>
<P>
   The censure of Buchanan can't compare:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time since somebody guaranteed a Super Bowl
victory,'' Denver defensive end Neil Smith said. ``Coaches don't
like it, players don't like it. But Ray said it, so now he's got to
live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't comment on stupidity,'' Bronco cornerback Ray Crockett
added.
</P>
<P>
   While the Broncos take the high road, some Colts players had
wanted to take Namath straight to the parking lot. That's what
happened when the quarterback and Lou Michaels, Baltimore's 275
-pound lineman turned field goal kicker, crossed paths in a Miami
night club before the game.
</P>
<P>
   Comments were exchanged and Namath added, ``What do you know?
You're just a field goal kicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Michaels suggested settling matters outside and teams squared
off until Namath defused the issue by picking up everybody's bar
tab. And why not? Back then he was the game's highest paid player,
making $400,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Buchanan _ a Pro Bowl cornerback whose seven
interceptions this season befit that ``Big Play'' nickname he
picked up at the University of Louisville _ is making $13 million
over four years. Yet all that pay doesn't get him Namath's kind of
play.
</P>
<P>
   Broadway Joe ended up dining at the White House and then landing
on Nixon's enemies list. He was roasted by Dean Martin and was in
movies opposite Ann-Margaret and Linda Evans. He did ads for
shaving cream, razors and panty hose and, today, still does
commercials for Nike. At the height of his career he was the
all-time swinger, sipping Johnnie Walker Red and making the scene
with Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr. and Raquel Welch.
</P>
<P>
   And his Jets' stunning 16-7 Super Bowl victory over the Colts
wasn't just one of the biggest upsets in NFL history, it became one
of the most pivotal of all pro football games. At a time when the
AFL was viewed as inferior to the NFL, it forced the game's old
guard to reassess and led to the merging of the two leagues.
</P>
<P>
   With no such history at stake, Buchanan still is trying to make
a statement with his resurgent team. ``In Atlanta, we've gone from
ground zero to the Super Bowl. Before, people thought so little of
us, they came to the (Georgia) Dome and bought hot dogs to go. Now
I know everybody still has us the underdog. In fact, I'm hearing it
so much I'm going out to buy me a dog collar tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he smiled and extended his right fist: ``But I've got
plenty room on this hand for a Super Bowl ring, too.''
</P>
<P>
   So that means he IS guaranteeing victory?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just saying we've got an opportunity to shock the world,''
he hedged. ``I believe we can win and I've got the guts to say it.
That's the kind of mind set a cornerback has to have. You play on
an island out there. You're all alone. Every game I feel like
Gilligan.
</P>
<P>
   ``But to be truthful, I didn't feel any link to Namath. I really
hadn't known quite what he said or how it played out back then. But
once the words came out of my mouth and I picked up the newspaper
the next morning, there was my picture and my promise. And right
then I thought, 'Oh no, what have I dug up? What have I gotten
into? I still don't quite understand it all. What I said was more
of a fun thing.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's why this Big Play hasn't made it to Broadway.

JUSTICES RULE AGAINST STATISTICAL SAMPLING IN 2000 CENSUS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Sub to correct party affiliation of House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill., in 14th graf) 
 
By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A sharply divided Supreme Court on Monday struck
down President Clinton's controversial proposal to use a
statistical formula to complement the traditional head count of the
U.S. population in the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, stung by the decision, might try to
conduct two counts of the U.S. population next year to ensure a
true result, Commerce Secretary William Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   That would depend on whether the Republican-led Congress, which
opposes statistical sampling, provides enough money for the Census
Bureau to conduct two counts.
</P>
<P>
   Daley, whose department conducts the census, said he was
``obviously disappointed'' with the court's decision. He said that
enhancing the head count with a statistical sampling is the best
way to prevent a repeat of the 1990 census, when 8 million people
were not counted.
</P>
<P>
   Daley said an additional survey, independent of the
constitutionally required Census, would be more accurate and ensure
that federal aid to the poor will be spent in the most needy areas.
</P>
<P>
   In its 5-4 decision, the high court ruled that Clinton's effort
to achieve a truer count through statistics runs afoul of the
federal Census Act, which the court said prohibits the federal
government from using statistics in addition to the standard
head-count census of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Census is conducted every 10 years to determine how the 435
seats in the House of Representatives will be apportioned among the
50 states.
</P>
<P>
   Daley, seizing on the court's finding that statistics may not be
used for apportionment, said the justices held open the legality of
using mathematical formulas for other purposes, such as finding
poor people who qualify for federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``A census based upon the old method will produce tremendous
undercounts,'' Daley said. ``We (at the Census Bureau) are
committed to having the most accurate census.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gene Green, D-Texas, assailed the high court's ruling,
saying statistics are the most effective way to prevent a repeat of
the undercount of Houston's population in 1990. That undercount, he
added, cost the city much needed federal assistance for social
programs.
</P>
<P>
   More than 66,000 people in Houston were not counted in the 1990
census.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to redouble our efforts to count everyone
in Houston,'' Green said. ``We pay the tax dollars, and we should
receive the benefits from them. If we're undercounted, those tax
dollars will go someplace else.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's decision marked a victory for the House and
16 people who sued the Clinton administration. The private citizens
wanted to force the president to abandon his proposal to use
statistics in addition to the traditional head count of the U.S.
population.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., hailed the court's
decision as an affirmation of the constitutional principle that
people should be counted, not scientifically polled. ``The
administration should abandon its illegal and risky polling scheme
and start preparing for a true head count,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the House Government Reform
Subcommittee on the Census, also praised the high court's decision
for ensuring that ``no administration would be permitted to
manipulate the census for its own political gain.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans have said Clinton wants to curry favor
with minorities and poor people, groups that are historically
undercounted and a traditional Democratic constituency.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration expects 67 percent of the U.S.
population to return completed census forms, which will be mailed
nationwide next year. The population would then be divided into
census tracts of about 4,000 people that have ``homogenous
population characteristics, economic status and living
conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau agents would then visit a randomly selected sample
of the housing units that did not submit census forms. The sample's
population numbers and characteristics would be added based on the
statistical results.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration argued that a statistical estimate is
needed for an accurate count. But the House Republicans and the
individuals countered that the Census Act and the Constitution
permit only an ``actual enumeration,'' or head count, for the
census.
</P>
<P>
   Federal district courts in Washington and eastern Virginia
agreed that the act prohibits statistical samples. The courts,
having decided the case on statutory grounds, did not reach the
issue of whether the Constitution permits statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the majority, agreed
with the lower courts and said Congress has prohibited the use of
statistics ever since the first census in 1790, when lawmakers
required census takers to swear to make ``a just and perfect
enumeration'' of every person in their districts. While federal law
permits statistics to be used to measure demographic data at other
times, the Census Act expressly prohibits their use for ``purposes
of apportionment'' of House members, O'Connor added.
</P>
<P>
   The high court, like the district courts, did not address the
issue of whether the Constitution bars statistics in calculating
the census, having resolved the legal issue based on the federal
law. Joining O'Connor's opinion were Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Antonin Scalia and
Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   In a vehement dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens said Congress
in 1976 amended the Census Act to permit the type of statistical
sampling the president wants to use next year. Stevens derided as
``an unusual tour de force'' the court's conclusion that the 1976
amendment did not change the federal government's authority with
regard to the census.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the court is correct, prior to 1976 the commerce secretary
could have used sampling for any census-related purpose except
apportionment, and after 1976 he retained precisely the same
authority,'' Stevens wrote. ``Why, one must wonder, did Congress
make this textual change in 1976?''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Stevens were Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Ruth Bader
Ginsburg and David H. Souter. Breyer also wrote separately to say
the Census Act permits statistics to be used to complement a
traditional head count but not to substitute for one.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, in her majority opinion, alienated Scalia and Thomas
in one part of her decision where she examined the legislative
history of the Census Act. O'Connor, in further explaining why the
Census Act bars statistics, wrote that no member of Congress during
the debate on the 1976 revision to the law ever said the amendment
would allow statistics to be part of the decennial population
survey.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia, an outspoken opponent of the use of legislative history
to determine what Congress intended, said such silence is
meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I join the opinion of the court, excluding, of course, its
resort ... to what was said by the individual legislators and
committees of legislators _ or more precisely (and worse yet), what
was not said by individual legislators and committees of
legislators,'' Scalia wrote in comments that Thomas joined.

 &HT;    Can't work without my totebag
 &HT;    By Frank Cerrabino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ OK, where's my souvenir totebag?
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure I can cover a Super Bowl without that bulging
totebag full of goodies.
</P>
<P>
   As I stand here at Super Bowl XXXIII media headquarters in the
downtown Hyatt, I feel like a set of tap shoes at a Baptist
wedding. The room is full of other media types wandering from booth
to booth with their totebags.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, I'm on the list of reporters credentialed to cover
the game without a totebag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, take one of these,'' an NFL credential official tells
me, handing me a laminated pass that says ``Virtual Voyage.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an invitation to a Super Bowl media party scheduled for
tomorrow night at Bayfront Park, in downtown Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean International is apparently going to simulate
taking the Super Bowl media on a cruise without actually going
through the hassle of letting us mess up an actual ship.
</P>
<P>
   I'd still rather have the totebag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have some goobers,'' a host committee representative from
Atlanta tells me.
</P>
<P>
   He points to a basket of peanuts inside a booth that serves the
purpose of reminding the media that next year's Super Bowl will be
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have a Coke,'' he says, pointing to a cooler, ``and you can
put your name in for a free T-shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   On my drive to Miami, I was listening on the radio to that story
about Salt Lake City's 2002 WInter Olympics bribery scandal. My
favorite line is from the guy who referred to the hundreds of
thousands of dollars in payoffs to International Olympic Committee
members as simply a matter of ``excessive gifting.''
</P>
<P>
   I can't imagine a totebag would fall under the category of
excessive gifting. As I head to the ``NFL Food Room'', I weigh the
moral bridge I am being denied a chance to cross.
</P>
<P>
   I have a seat on the plush couch, near the big screen TV. But
instead of watching ESPN, my gaze is toward the totebag-worthy
member of the media sitting next to me, as he goes through his bag.
It brings back memories of Christmas mornings, and stockings
stuffled like sausages hanging from the chimney.
</P>
<P>
   Official Super Bowl patch. Official Super Bowl notebook.
Official Super Bowl CD-rom video. Another laminated invitation _
this one is for another party on Thursday, on the Las Olas
Riverfront in Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   That makes sense. There can't just be one media party.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the real contest for Super Bowls in South Florida
is the game played between Miami-Dade and Broward counties. If one
county has a Super Bowl event, the other county has to be given a
corresponding event.
</P>
<P>
   I claim partial responsibility for this. Years ago, I wrote a
story about how nearly all the bands that marched in the Orange
Bowl Parade chose to stay in hotels in Broward County and did their
best to stay out of Miami-Dade. This prompted Miami-Dade's civic
leaders to demand parity at big regional tourist events.
</P>
<P>
   So Tuesday's party is in Miami-Dade, Thursday's party in
Broward. The Denver Broncos are staying and practicing in Broward.
The Atlanta Falcons are staying and practicing in Miami-Dade.
</P>
<P>
   Broward gets the Super Bowl fashion show. Miami-Dade gets the
Super Bowl golf tournament. And I don't get the totebag.
</P>
<P>
   I walk by the ping pong table _ You don't expect us to cover the
Super Bowl without ping pong! _ and head for the bank of ``NFL
Information Center'' computers.
</P>
<P>
   I punch up ``Frequently Asked Questions'', expecting to see:
``Hey, why didn't I get a totebag?'' or ``Where are the ping-pong
balls?''
</P>
<P>
   But instead, it told me that the league buys 90 rings for the
Super Bowl winning team (cost $4,000 each), and buys 90 pieces of
jewelry for the losing team, as long as the jewelry costs no more
than half the price of the winners' rings. It didn't say what kind
of jewelry the losers get. My guess is choker chains.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I should actually read this mountain of material stacked
all over the place here. Maybe I should immerse myself in this
statistical avalanche. Maybe I should find out what kind of jewelry
the losers get, and answer all those other questions that my
colleagues might miss in their otherwise exhaustive coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, I should get my mind off that totebag.
</P>
<P>
   I look at the upcoming schedule. Here's an event: ``National
Anthem and pregame show news conference'' on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   I take out my notebook, realizing it's never too early to
prepare incisive questions for Cher and the rock band, KISS.
</P>
<P>
   Question No. 1 ... hmm.
</P>
<P>
   I'm drawing a blank. It's getting close to lunch time. The NFL
Food Room is revving up with the kind of expectation you'd expect
to find in prisons and zoos.
</P>
<P>
   What to ask? What to ask? Ah, I've got it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cher, does singing the National Anthem at Sunday's game mean
you get a totebag?''
</P>

SEATTLE TO HOST NEXT WTO MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON and RON REDMOND  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seattle will host the next meeting of the World
Trade Organization, welcoming a group of world leaders who will
bring an international spotlight to the city this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The White House chose Seattle over Honolulu and San Diego in a
hotly contested competition to host the late November gathering of
more than 5,000 delegates from around the world. The conference is
considered a big enough plum that Vice President Al Gore telephoned
Sen. Patty Murray from Air Force Two to give her the news.
</P>
<P>
   Technically the meeting is for the trade ministers of the 133
member countries, as well as the 31 countries seeking membership,
including Russia and China. But the last such meeting, in Geneva
last year, attracted 20 heads of state, including President
Clinton, South African President Nelson Mandela, Cuban President
Fidel Castro and British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the largest trade event ever held in the United
States, and it will inaugurate global negotiations which will shape
world trade as we move to the next century,'' said U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky, who will chair the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle beat more than 40 other U.S. cities for the honor of
hosting the event. The city was chosen largely because of its
successful experience hosting the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum in 1993, as well as a meeting of trade officials from the
United States, Canada, Japan and the European Union in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is the administration has a track record with
Seattle in big events,'' said assistant trade representative Jay
Ziegler. ``The city also reflects unprecedented economic diversity
_ it would be hard to pick a city where there's a better trade
story to tell in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's business and community leaders pushed hard for the
meeting. Boeing Chief Executive Office Phil Condit and Microsoft
Chairman Bill Gates agreed to chair the host committee, and a
variety of elected officials lobbied the White House once Seattle
made the list of finalists, which also included Dallas, Denver,
Detroit, Honolulu and San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a great coup for Seattle, particularly because we were
operating against people who had nice weather in November and
December,'' said Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., who had pushed for
the gathering. ``Everything else about our city matched what they
were looking for. Seattle shone like a star.''
</P>
<P>
   The 5,000 attendees are expected to include about 3,000
delegates, as well as a large international press corps and a
variety of observers from non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a phenomenal opportunity to showcase Washington
state,'' said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. ``The whole world is
coming to Seattle. This is like hitting the jackpot.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's boosters cited everything from the quality of local
restaurants to the new symphony hall. But administration officials
said more important factors were the city and state government's
past cooperation on security matters and other logistical issues,
as well as the network of hotels and transportation facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seattle has a history of hosting these things, and we just
know how to do it,'' said Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash. ``I'm
thrilled.''
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, civic and trade groups said the decision is a
reflection of the region's growing international stature and
outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not only a great honor for our city and our state, but
a testimony to our region's dependence on trade,'' said Pat Davis,
president of the Washington Council on International Trade, which
led the drive to bring the meeting to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inherent internationalism of the city, the cooperative
spirit of the organizing groups and the broad community backing
evidenced in Seattle were all factors in the proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the trade council will immediately step up the
organizing effort, establishing committees to handle transportation
and logistics, outside events, fundraising and media preparations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll get advertising through the news media that we couldn't
afford to buy,'' Seattle Mayor Paul Schell added. ``This is a big
win for our community.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Morris, president and chief executive officier of the
Seattle-King County Convention and Visitors Bureau, said the WTO
meeting will be about five times larger than the average convention
in Seattle and will require a heavy emphasis on protocol because of
the number of government ministers attending.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said organizers here had ``been waiting on pins and
needles'' since last fall, when the bureau asked local hoteliers to
hold rooms open for the week of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been holding everything in the city,'' he said.
``Everything held together, but it has been a day-to-day effort to
communicate with everyone to be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   The visitors bureau also had to convince a national association
of optomitrists to delay their convention by a week.
</P>
<P>
   Although many had predicted San Diego or Honolulu would be much
more attractive in late November and early December, Morris said
the WTO isn't all that concerned about the weather because
delegates don't have much free time anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be lucky to get out of the convention center,'' he
said. ``And Geneva doesn't exactly have perfect weather either.''
</P>
<P>
   When they do go outside, delegates will find just about
everything they need within walking distance downtown, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Another selling point was Seattle's proximity to Vancouver,
B.C., which will be used as an alternative air hub for those
delegates wanting to avoid U.S. airports on the busy Thanksgiving
weekend. Morris said a shuttle service will be available for those
who choose to fly into Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, from Nov. 30 to Dec. 3, will be the third
ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization, which was
formed in 1995 as a successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade. The previous meetings were held in Geneva in 1998 and in
Singapore in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO is the only international body dealing with the rules of
trade between nations. The organization governs international
commerce and trade policy, attempting to help trade flow as freely
as possible, to achieve further liberalization gradually through
negotiation, and to set up an impartial means of settling disputes.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in his State of the Union Address, called for
a new round of global negotiations to start at the ministerial
meeting, which Seattle boosters hope will now go down in trade
history as the Seattle Round. The negotiations are to focus on open
markets for agriculture and services, as well as institutional
changes to make the WTO more open to the public and trade issues
for biotechnology and electronic commerce.

 &HT;    For sale: 5 foot sculpture of Judge Roy Bean
 &HT;    By Mike Kelley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Sculpted in meticulous detail and cast in
bronze, Judge Roy Bean, ``The Law West of the Pecos,'' holds court
again surrounded by vaqueros on their ponies, a dog lazing on the
front porch and his bear, Bruno, tied to a post.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-long, 250-pound piece is the work of Dave Gardner, a
61-year-old native Texan and ranch foreman turned sculptor and
bootmaker. He'd love to see it on display at the state visitors
center in Langtry, where Judge Roy held court. So if someone has
the $75,000 asking price and would like to put it out there in Val
Verde County, that would be just fine.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner, who now lives in Mississippi, was in town for a viewing
of the piece Monday at the Austin Convention and Visitors Bureau,
where it will be for the next couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It took him about 14 months to sculpt. A prospective buyer in
Florida backed out, and Gardner would just as soon see it stay home
anyway. ``It's Texas history, and it needs to stay in Texas,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Pete Gallego, who represents Langtry, inspected the
sculpture Monday and agreed. It would make ``a perfect addition''
to the newly remodeled center, he said. If using state money isn't
an option, Gallego said, maybe private donors can be found to put
Judge Roy in Langtry. ``But it is a beautiful work of art.''

BRUINS GOT MESSAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Coach Steve Lavin wasn't happy with UCLA's
first-half performance at Louisville, but he wasn't nearly as vexed
as guards Earl Watson and Baron Davis.
</P>
<P>
   As the Bruins gathered for their post-halftime huddle, Davis let
his rage rip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was furious,'' he said. ``We knew we weren't playing hard.
We challenged each person.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, that meant Davis challenged his teammates to tighten
their defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lot different UCLA team,'' Davis said. ``We're more
defensive-minded. We work hard. It's a blue-collar team.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers agree: UCLA is holding its opponents to 40.3 percent
shooting from the field _ the lowest figure in the post-Wooden era,
fractionally better than the 1995 NCAA title team.
</P>
<P>
   __ Foul ball: One measure of UCLA's defense performance is the
number of fouls it commits. If the No. 11 Bruins are reaching,
grabbing, lunging and gambling _ as they did against Stanford (35
fouls) _ they're committing unnecessary fouls and putting opponents
on the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   If they're moving their feet and using their heads _ as they did
against Louisville (20 fouls) _ they're playing sound,
well-positioned defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to gamble sometimes and that's not smart,'' Davis
said. ``We reach and make silly fouls. If we can get rid of the
silly fouls, play hard and be solid, we can be a great defensive
team.''
</P>
<P>
   __ A power Rush: Because of matchups, foul trouble and injuries,
small forward JaRon Rush has spent substantial time at power
forward in recent weeks. That trend continued at Louisville, since
the Bruins were without starting center Dan Gadzuric (sprained
ankle).
</P>
<P>
   Rush grabbed nine rebounds and played with his usual tenacity
and abandon. Although he's shooting just 36.4 percent, the 6-foot-6
Rush leads the Bruins in rebounding in Pac-10 play, with 8.5 per
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``To compensate for his shooting, he's helping us with
rebounding and steals,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   __ No coincidence: Injuries might have contributed to UCLA's
improved play at Louisville. Without Gadzuric and guard Rico Hines
(broken foot), Lavin's 10-man rotation was whittled to eight.
</P>
<P>
   Five players _ Watson, Davis, Rush, Ray Young and Jerome Moiso _
played at least 25 minutes, and three others played 11-17 minutes
in supporting roles. The tight distribution seemed to create more
cohesion and better rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford observers have proffered the same theory to explain its
success. Injuries to center Jason Collins and two guards, Mike
McDonald and Ryan Mendez, forced Cardinal coach Mike Montgomery to
play eight men instead of 10, his rotation at the beginning of the
season. Several Pac-10 coaches believe it has made Stanford more
efficient and effective.
</P>
<P>
   __ No coincidence II: UCLA took a season-low six 3-pointers
against Louisville, including just two in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-point attempts rise and fall in inverse proportion to the
Bruins' poise and ball movement. To wit: In their most impatient
game, Oregon State, they took 27 3-pointers, a season high.
</P>
<P>
   Most opponents try to bait the Bruins into shooting 3-pointers
early in possessions, for two reasons: They're shooting 29.7
percent from 3-point range and 50.9 percent from 2-point range.

INTEL RETREATS ON CHIP CONTAINING AN ID CODE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to change word in 2nd graf to piracy, stead of privacy.)  By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Intel Corp. backed away on Monday from a plan to embed an
identifying signature in its next generation of computer chips,
bowing to protests that the technology would compromise the privacy
of users.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, which makes about 85 percent of the world's computer
processors, announced last week that each of its new Pentium III
chips would have an identifying serial number that would enhance
the security of electronic commerce and guard against software
piracy.
</P>
<P>
   But advocacy groups said they feared it would mark a further
erosion of anonymity on the Internet and would allow companies to
collect detailed profiles of consumers, which could then be resold.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Intel said it would modify the identification system
in the new chips so that it is automatically disabled unless the
computer user voluntarily turns it on. The company said it would
also offer free software to allow customers to turn off the feature
permanently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always understood that there are security questions that
get raised when someone is providing identification in a
transaction,'' Tom Waldrop, an Intel spokesman, said in explaining
the reversal. ``Whether an individual is showing a driver's license
of handing over a credit card number, it always raises a privacy
question. We have done things to address that. You have to weigh
the positive value of having more secured Internet transactions,
more secure electronic commerce, against any privacy concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy
Information Center, a privacy advocacy group in Washington, D.C.,
which had called for a boycott of the new chip, said, ``It looks
like we won Round 1.'' But he said much more needed to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a temporary fix, he said. ``It can be as easily disabled
as enabled. There's not enough assurance here that the chip will
not be misused.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel said it would continue to work with consumer groups to
allay fears about the new chip.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, the world's largest chipmaker, with $26.2 billion in
sales last year, said the chip signature was intended to promote
the growth of electronic commerce by giving companies a better way
to verify the identities of their customers. It said the feature
could also be used to avoid piracy by preventing a single copy of a
software program from being installed on several machines.
</P>
<P>
   But after Intel last week announced plans to include the
identification technology in its Pentium III chips, which are due
for release in a few months, a furor ensued.
</P>
<P>
   Junkbusters, a high-tech lobbying group based in Green Brook,
N.J., said in a statement on its Web site: ``Intel's proposal to
put a unique ID code inside of every computer it sells will
significantly reduce the level of privacy available to computer
users around the world. The unique code will make possible far more
extensive tracking and profiling of individual activity, without
either the knowledge or consent of the user.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Rep. Edward Markey, the senior Democrat on the House
consumer protection subcommittee, wrote a letter to Intel's chief
executive, Craig Barrett, asking that the company reconsider its
plans, ``to better balance both commercial and privacy
objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Markey said he understood the technology's implications for
online commerce, where the anonymity of the Internet can encourage
fraud. But he expressed concern that it would also help online
marketers surreptitiously track consumers on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel's new product improves technology for online commerce in
a way that compromises personal privacy,'' Markey wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The skirmish over the Pentium III is the latest front in the
struggle between security and privacy on the Internet. Earlier
rounds have focused on the use of an identifying mechanism called
``cookies,'' which enable Web sites to write information onto a
computer's hard drive that could serve to identify the computer
user on future visits. Many Web sites now require users to accept a
cookie as a condition of entry. But unlike cookies, which are
contained in a text file that can be altered or deleted by the
user, the Pentium III signature would be a part of the hardware.
</P>
<P>
   In its effort to reassure consumers, Intel said it would not
maintain a master database of consumer names matched to Pentium
serial numbers. The company said it would also encourage Web sites
and software programmers to warn consumers whenever the serial
number is retrieved.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the privacy debate has focused on how online
marketers and companies collect personal information, the new
technology also raises concerns about whether it could be used by
law enforcement officials and governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always thought that in this debate over authentication,
governments would like more rather than less,'' Rotenberg said.
``This is the flip side of anonymity, and governments are pushing
for authentication. So there are some real concerns about
government control.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute erupted at an awkward time for the Clinton
administration, which has for months been trying to convince the
European Union that American companies are doing enough to protect
consumer privacy on line.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the European Union enacted a tough privacy law that
prohibits companies doing business in its 15-member countries from
disclosing personal information about customers without their
consent. Rather than pass a law adopting the European Union
requirements, the Clinton administration has been pushing online
marketers and merchants to adopt self-regulatory models for
protecting consumers on line. But it has had a tough time selling
that approach as adequate to the European Union, although the union
has delayed sanctions against the United States while negotiations
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Clayton, counsel and senior privacy analyst for Stone
Investments, a technology investment firm based in Dallas, said
that while there are some legitimate privacy concerns with the new
technology, ``this is designed to actually protect people from
something privacy advocates have been talking about, which is theft
of personal information and fraud.''

AN UNAPOLOGETIC LAWRENCE TAYLOR SAYS HE BELONGS IN HALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.J., Texas, Calif., Fla.)  (mk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Saying his entrance into the Hall of Fame should be a
``no brainer,'' former New York Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor
made his case to the news media Monday _ some of whom hold the key
to whether he gets in _ stating that his myriad personal problems
should have nothing to do with the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to start going into off-the-field problems,
you're going to have to kick half of the people out of the Hall of
Fame now,'' Taylor said in a conference call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there have never been writers who have ever done
drugs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, speaking of himself, added: ``Has he ever had problems?
Guilty. Has he ever been through controversy? Guilty. Will he have
problems again? Probably. But I don't apologize for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor is one of 15 finalists on this year's Hall of Fame
ballot. The vote is on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The voting committee is composed of news media representatives
from all 30 National Football League cities, plus five at-large
members and the president of the Pro Football Writers of America.
All candidates must receive a minimum of 80 percent of the vote, or
29 of the 36 votes.
</P>
<P>
   The others on the ballot are George Allen, who was coach of the
Los Angeles Rams and Washington Redskins; running back Eric

   At one point in his 13-year career, Taylor was a lock to get
into the Hall of Fame, prompting his coach with the Giants, Bill
Parcells, to say that Taylor would go in on roller skates. Taylor
changed the position of linebacker with his great combination of
size and speed. He always played hurt, and one thing few people
remember about him is that he was the ultimate team player. Taylor
did not care if he had three sacks in a game or none as long as the
Giants won.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor helped the Giants win two Super Bowls and is more
responsible for the Giants getting back to a championship level
than any other player.
</P>
<P>
   While Taylor will likely get in, his personal problems have put
his entrance at risk. Taylor, suspended once as a player for drug
use for four games, has been arrested three times since he retired
in 1993, the most damaging arrest coming on charges of buying $50
worth of crack cocaine from an undercover police officer last Oct.
19 in a St. Petersburg Beach, Fla., hotel room. There were 15 crack
pipes in the room, according to police. Taylor claimed he was set
up.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Taylor was arrested in Myrtle Beach, S.C., for
allegedly trying to buy $100 worth of fake crack cocaine from an
undercover officer. His record in that case was wiped clean after
he undertook 60 hours of community service and submitted to drug
counseling and random drug testing.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the Florida arrest, Taylor entered a drug
rehabilitation clinic in New Jersey. Taylor said Monday that he was
in an outpatient rehabilitation program, but he would not give
details.
</P>
<P>
   All of these events have given some voters pause, saying that a
known drug offender should not be permitted in the Hall of Fame.
Taylor said he had no apologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If guys are asking me to apologize, or be remorseful for what
I've done, I can't do that,'' he said. ``There are some things I'd
like to change, but I can't change them, so I'm not going to worry
about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was asked what he would say to people who feel his
problems should prevent him from going into the Hall of Fame.
``That's up to them,'' Taylor said. ``I don't do the voting. That's
not my call. That's something for you guys to decide. It's just
another part of life. If I don't get in, I don't get in.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Luksa, a columnist for The Dallas Morning News, and Jerry
Magee, a football writer for The San Diego Union Tribune, both said
they were leaning against voting for Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed that at least five or six writers will vote
against Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are alcoholics, drug addicts, and adulterers in
the Hall of Fame,'' Luksa said, ``but I have never knowingly voted
for a guy who had a drug charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor has been busy in recent months in Florida filming ``On
Any Given Sunday.'' The movie is directed by Oliver Stone and is
about the seedy side of professional football.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go around town and I see players, they walk up to me
and go, `Can I shake the hand of the greatest?''' Taylor said. ``I
want to get into the Hall of Fame, but hearing things like that
makes me very happy.''

CITIGROUP'S 4TH-QUARTER OPERATING EARNINGS PLUNGED 27 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Citigroup, still struggling to revive its corporate
banking business, said Monday that its fourth-quarter operating
earnings plunged 27 percent, although the weak performance was
bolstered by a strong showing from the consumer banking operation
and exceeded analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, created last year by the merger of Citicorp and
Travelers Group Inc., said its Salomon Smith Barney investment
banking unit continued to post extremely poor results, particularly
in bond trading, although the company's overall performance in
volatile emerging markets showed a sharp rebound from recent
problems it had encountered.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup's consumer business now accounts for two-thirds of the
combined company's profits, and its credit card operation in
particular produced robust gains in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In a candid remark that reveals how much the credit and charge
card industry has fallen under the sway of just a few large
issuers, Citigroup's co-chief executive, John S. Reed, said in a
conference call that marketing campaigns would now emphasize his
company's brand name on its cards at the expense of the ubiquitous
Visa and Mastercard logos.
</P>
<P>
   The company, the nation's largest financial services concern,
said core earnings in the fourth quarter fell to $1.4 billion, or
60 cents a diluted share, from $1.93 billion, or 80 cents a share,
in the quarter a year earlier. Figures for 1997 were computed as if
the merger had been completed then.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had been expecting earnings of 56 cents a share,
according to consensus estimates set by the First Call Corp., which
tracks company earnings.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, Citigroup reported operating earnings of $6.3
billion on revenue of $49.8 billion, compared with earnings of $7.8
billion on revenue of $47.8 billion in 1997. In trading on the New
York Stock Exchange, shares of Citigroup rose $1.625, or about 3
percent, to $53.25.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very encouraged,'' said Judah Kraushaar, an analyst with
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. He noted that Salomon Smith Barney's earnings
of $13 million, while down sharply from $218 million in 1997's
fourth quarter, at least returned to profitability after a
disastrous third quarter. Kraushaar also cited the credit card
operation, a sizable stock buyback and continued growth in the
consumer business as reasons for optimism about Citigroup in the
year ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're not happy with the bottom-line results,''
Reed said in the conference call. But, he said, ``we're feeling
reasonably good about the outlook for our business.''
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup said it expected to generate ``significantly higher
levels'' of profits this year as its business expands, expenses are
tightened and the company reduces the risks it is exposed to around
the world. Reed said the bank planned to integrate the
risk-management operations of Citicorp and Travelers to better
coordinate oversight of potential financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``My previous assumption was that the company would have trouble
reaching a 15 percent growth rate in earnings against its 1997
benchmark,'' said Diane Glossman, an analyst with Lehman Brothers
Inc. ``Over all, I think it's still too early to tell whether they
can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said expenses were still high at the bank, with hefty
technology costs associated with events like the Year 2000 computer
problem. But compensation costs still rose at the company, in part
because Citigroup decided to pay out larger year-end bonuses than
planned to retain talented employees in its corporate banking
business.
</P>
<P>
   Bonuses, the ultimate arbiter of loyalty on Wall Street, will be
paid at the end of the month, and there has been a great deal of
tension within Citigroup's already fractious corporate business
over their size. Investment banking bonuses will be down about 3
percent, and bond traders will see bonuses drop more significantly,
according to Citigroup employees, although the drops will not be as
severe as originally expected.
</P>
<P>
   Economic turmoil in Brazil has raised concerns about the Latin
American exposure of large international banks like Citigroup,
although Reed said Monday that the bank had anticipated Brazil's
devaluation of its currency, the real, and was not seriously hurt
by the move. He said Citigroup's Brazilian credit card business had
been experiencing some problems, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil has an internal debt problem, but it does not have an
external debt problem,'' Reed added, noting that Citigroup has yet
to see any significant economic pressure on Argentina because of
Brazil's problems. Citigroup had about $8.4 billion in lending
exposure to Brazil, Argentina and Mexico at the end of last year's
third quarter. More current figures were unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   The main driver of Citigroup's business remains the consumer
lending and banking franchise, which kicked in $901 million worth
of earnings in the fourth quarter, a 20 percent increase. Credit
and charge card receivables grew smartly in the fourth quarter,
even as credit losses continued to decline, a big turnaround from
the problems Citigroup has experienced in its card business
recently.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup's results for all of 1998 included a bevy of charges,
including $703 million of a previously announced $900 million
charge related to eliminating about 10,400 jobs. That represents
about 6 percent of Citigroup's work force. An undisclosed but
substantial number of the job cuts will involve layoffs.

POPE CHALLENGES FAITHFUL TO HELP SOLVE SOCIAL PROBLEMS IN FAREWELL
MESSAGE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICHARD VARA 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Pope John Paul II, in his farewell message to
Mexico on Monday, challenged Christians to build a peace-filled,
ecologically aware, socially just world in the new millennium ``not
with useless confrontation, but your (spiritual) life witness.''
</P>
<P>
   The 78-year-old pontiff's challenge came during a colorful,
spectacle-filled meeting with representatives of the elderly, youth
and Indian populations in a packed Azteca Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The event, which drew more than 125,000 people, was broadcast to
an estimated 80 million Latin American television viewers and to
similar celebrations in Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Venezuela. It
was also broadcast in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration, which included dancing, a fireworks show and an
address by the pope, appeared to buoy and, at times, to emotionally
overcome the spiritual leader of the world's 1 billion Roman
Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago I use to think of myself as a (Slavic) pope,'' he
said. ``Now I think of myself as a Mexican (pope).''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd chanted, ``Brother, brother, you are Mexican now.''
</P>
<P>
   The event was the final major public appearance for the pope
before flying to St. Louis on Tuesday for a 30-hour visit that
includes a meeting with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not the end of the extraordinary emotional
``papa-mania'' that has gripped this country of 98 million since
the pope's arrival Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The pontiff's every move has received saturation coverage by the
local media. He has been met everywhere by mobs of cheering, often
teary-eyed, Mexicans, including thousands who spent hours in the
pre-dawn chill awaiting for a fleeting glimpse as he left the
residence of the papal ambassador where he is staying. His Sunday
Mass drew an estimated 1 million worshippers.
</P>
<P>
   The frail pope has used the massive public forums to emphasize
Catholic spiritual renewal and a new wave of evangelization for the
third millennium. He has also called for Christian concern and
involvement in building a just world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, as Christ's disciples, desire that in the following
centuries, unity may prevail over division, fraternity over
antagonism, peace over war,'' John Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   The pope told the people packed into the stadium that an
authentic Christian lives and concern will help overcome problems
in social progress, especially among the indigenous and peasant
farmers. Both groups are at the bottom of the economic and social
ladders in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because some of the powerful turned their backs on Christ,
this century sits by helplessly while millions of human beings die
of starvation,'' the pope said.
</P>
<P>
   The indifference and refusal by the rich and influential to
promote moral values has lead to drug-trafficking, corruption and
unbridled consumerism or widespread hedonism, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The pope said the rich also were indifferent to ``the growing
abyss between poor, indebted countries and strong, rich ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The rich ``continue to ignore the intrinsic perversion and the
terrible consequences of the 'culture of death,''' he said. The
pope coined the term ``culture of death'' to refer to abortion,
euthanasia and other life-destroying practices.
</P>
<P>
   While the pope called for a new Catholic evangelization, he
counseled against forcing people to believe in Christ. ``We do not
want to impose (Christ's) message, but rather propose it with
complete freedom and bearing in mind that Christ alone has words of
eternal life,'' the pontiff said.
</P>
<P>
   He apparently was referring to cults or the sometimes violent
reaction of some Catholics to other denominations.
</P>
<P>
   The pope challenged the audience, primarily young people, not to
despair of the world's problems or hostile attitudes but to revert
to prayer and a strong spiritual life to overcome evil.
</P>
<P>
   ``You, Mexican and American youth, have to assure that the world
be oriented to God and that the political, scientific, financial
and culture institutions be authentically at the service of man and
without racial or social discrimination,'' the pope said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Show yourselves to be untiring promoters of dialogue and
harmony in a world where force predominates over right and where
indifference is commonplace before the drama of hunger and illness
suffered by great masses of the population,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The pope appeared at times wide-eyed and stunned by the cheering
and ``waves'' surging through the stadium crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd's high spirits were dampened near the end of the event
when the pope announced an earthquake in Colombia had claimed more
than 200 lives.
</P>
<P>
   He led the audience in prayers for the victims.
</P>

CONSERVATIVES OPEN DRIVE AGAINST AFFIRMATIVE ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Mich., Texas, La., Miss., Calif., Ill., N.Y., N.H.,
N.C., Va., Pa., N.J., Mo.) (mk) 
 By ETHAN BRONNER

<P>
   On 15 campuses across the country, students will open their
college newspapers Tuesday to a full-page advertisement with the
headline ``Guilty by Admission'' and, in bold print, ``Nearly Every
Elite College in America Violates the Law. Does Yours?''
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement, which condemns ``the lingering presence of
unlawful racial preferences'' and urges students to download or
send away for a free handbook on how to tell whether their college
is breaking the law on race and admissions, is part of a new
campaign by the Center for Individual Rights, a conservative
public-policy law firm in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The student handbook includes sections on how to use freedom of
information laws, what kinds of data to request from the
university, what disparities to note and how to find a lawyer and
bring a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, to be announced Tuesday at a Washington news
conference featuring former Education Secretary William Bennett and
the commentator Nat Hentoff, asserts that most colleges that engage
in race-conscious admissions do so in a way that violates the law.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Individual Rights, sensing that its arguments are
gaining momentum, opens its new drive just as it prepares to go to
trial in two crucial cases involving race and admissions policy.
The first case, against the University of Washington Law School, is
due for trial in February, and the second trial, involving suits
against the University of Michigan and its law school, is expected
in May or June.
</P>
<P>
   It was the center that successfully sued the University of Texas
in what became known as the Hopwood case. As a result of the
decision in Hopwood vs. State of Texas, issued by a federal appeals
court in 1996, Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi are barred from
consideration of race in college admissions. In addition, voters in
California and Washington State have passed ballot initiatives
ending consideration of race by public agencies and universities in
hiring and admissions. (The suit in Washington, on behalf of a
rejected white applicant, was filed before the referendum there.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We are arguing that colleges are using racial preferences to
get a certain mix in their student bodies, and that is illegal,''
said Terence Pell, senior counsel at the center. ``They are
misusing the Supreme Court precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   The precedent in question is the 1978 decision in University of
California Regents vs. Bakke, dealing with the medical school at
the University of California at Davis, which set aside a certain
number of places for minority students. In a splintered and complex
decision, the Supreme Court said the university could not engage in
such set-asides.
</P>
<P>
   The deciding opinion was written by Justice Lewis Powell Jr.,
who found that race-sensitive admissions in efforts to overcome
``societal discrimination'' were illegal. Powell said universities
could, however, take race into account as one of several factors in
their attempts to create a student body of diverse backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Pell said many colleges had reduced the notion of ``diversity''
to nothing more than skin color or ethnicity, in violation of the
Bakke ruling. He said the center's campaign was necessary now
because the debate had shifted with recent defenses of
race-conscious admissions, notably in a book by William Bowen and
Derek Bok, ``The Shape of the River'' (Princeton University Press,
1998), which points to the policy's benefits, largely the building
of a black middle class.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book argues that we need to boost the number of blacks in
elite colleges for the social good,'' Pell said. ``That may be
true, but that is what Powell said you can't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowen, president of the Andrew Mellon Foundation, whose book is
an examination and defense of race-conscious admissions at 28 top
universities, said Pell was mistaken, particularly in arguing that
the definition of diversity had been narrowed to the meaning of
race or ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to data in the book showing that at five universities
for which complete statistics were at hand, 25 percent of all black
applicants with SAT scores from 1400 to 1450 _ very high scores _
had been denied admission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the admission decisions are not based on race alone,''
he said. ``Are the chances higher if you are black than if you are
white? Absolutely. But is that the only thing that matters? No.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign by the Center for Individual Rights has several
aspects. Apart from the Washington news conference Tuesday,
advertisements are being taken out in student newspapers at these
15 colleges and universities: the University of Chicago, Columbia,
Dartmouth, Duke, James Madison, North Carolina, Pennsylvania,
Pittsburgh, Rutgers, Stanford, Virginia, Wake Forest, George
Washington University, Washington University in St. Louis, and
William and Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Pell said that in determining where to run the advertisements,
the center had settled not only on a number of elite colleges but
also on a few less selective ones, in an effort to reach students
who might have been rejected by top-tier institutions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, advertisements aimed at university trustees will
appear in The Chronicle of Higher Education and Philanthropy
Magazine. ``We think the trustees have an interest in getting
involved,'' Pell said, ``to avoid personal liability.''
</P>
<P>
   Penda Hair, a civil rights lawyer, says the center is
essentially asserting that under Bakke, race can never be decisive.
That, she says, is simply wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does it mean to take something into account if it is not
in some situations decisive?'' she said. ``The goal of affirmative
action is to increase the inclusion of minorities. So the fact that
you achieve that goal doesn't in and of itself make it
unconstitutional under Bakke.''

PEPSICO'S LATEST STRATEGIC MOVE IN A CONTINUING EFFORT TO BE A TRUE
CHALLENGER TO COCA-COLA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill., Ind., Mo., Ohio, Va., W.Va.)   (af)  
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the last year, Pepsico has been engaged in an intense
campaign to transform its public image from perennial second-place
finisher to a true challenger to the Coca-Cola Co.
</P>
<P>
   There have been changes in marketing, personnel and corporate
structure. And, confirming what analysts had expected for months,
Pepsico announced late Monday that it was transferring several of
its company-owned bottling franchises to the Whitman Corp., the
publicly traded owner of Pepsi's second-largest bottler.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with Whitman, based in Rolling Meadows, Ill., creates
the first of as many as six regional anchor bottlers for Pepsico, a
system patterned after a commercially successful one set up by the
Coca-Cola Co. The change comes after a reorganization late last
year of Pepsico's sales and marketing divisions and is seen as a
crucial part of its strategy to gain market share against its
archrival.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico's chairman and chief executive, Roger Enrico, first
disclosed the bottling plan last summer in a series of meetings
with analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman executives planned a dinner party in Manhattan Monday
night to discuss details of the changes with Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Pepsico is preparing the initial public
offering of its company-owned bottler, the Pepsi Bottling Group.
The company issued its prospectus two weeks ago, though many
interesting details, like how large a stake would be held by
Pepsico, were omitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important step and a positive step in the overhaul
of the Pepsi bottling system in the U.S.,'' said John D. Sicher,
publisher of Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter. ``Whitman is
the largest independent Pepsi bottler and one of the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman will take title to Pepsi franchises in Illinois,
Indiana, Missouri and Ohio. In addition, Whitman gets bottling
operations in Poland, where it already has a strong presence;
Hungary; the Czech Republic, and the Slovak Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The businesses changing hands generated revenue last year of
$540 million in the United States and $180 million abroad,
according to a statement issued by Pepsico.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, which took its name from the confectionery company that
made Whitman's Samplers, although that division has since been
sold, will relinquish to Pepsico its franchises in Marion, Va., and
Princeton, W.Va., as well as one international franchise in St.
Petersburg, Russia. The American businesses produced $54 million in
revenue last year, while the St. Petersburg franchise produced $23
million.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman will also assume some American liabilities associated
with Pepsico's operations and will acquire the international
properties for cash. The net gain for Pepsico, the company said, is
$300 million.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico will hold 54 million shares of common stock in Whitman,
giving Pepsico a 35 percent stake in the company. Whitman will
begin a share repurchase program that is expected to raise
Pepsico's stake to nearly 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That is pretty close to the model created by Coca-Cola in 1986,
when it spun off Coca-Cola Enterprises, now the world's largest
Coke bottler with annual sales of 3.4 billion cases in the United
States, Canada and Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, which is expected to announce its fourth-quarter
earnings this week, holds a 44 percent stake in Coca-Cola
Enterprises. That suggests Pepsico will hold a stake of 40 percent
or so in the rest of its bottlers, including Pepsi Bottling Group.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico also announced Monday that it expected a string of
one-time items that would result in a gain of 2 cents a diluted
share. The quarter's earnings are not scheduled to be released
until next week, but Pepsico's statement said it expected a gain of
19 cents a share from settlement of a long-running dispute with the
Internal Revenue Service over its operations in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the company's Frito-Lay division said it would
close some plants and expand others, at a cost of 2 cents a share,
and a $218 million loss in Russia by Pepsi-Cola International would
cost shareholders 14 cents in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, all the administrative work involved in spinning off
the company-owned bottler had to be accounted for. That, along with
additional marketing and promotional spending for Pepsi One, the
company's new diet cola, will cost shareholders another penny, a
Pepsico spokesman said. &QL;

 Seniors Scramble for Health Care  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Patricia Belluomini's insurance nightmare began in November, when
her Aetna HMO stopped providing Medicare coverage through nearby
Sequoia Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of having a hospital nearby hit home one night
when her husband suffered a stroke. ``I had him in the car and at
the hospital in three to four minutes, and he still lost sight in
one eye,'' said Belluomini, who shuddered at the thought of a
30-minute drive.
</P>
<P>
   Shakened by the loss of Aetna, the couple, both in their
mid-70s, moved quickly to secure a replacement Medicare HMO,
HealthNet's Secure Horizons. But days later HealthNet threw her a
curve, saying it wanted her and her husband to switch to one of two
hospitals more than 20 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way we'd do that,'' said Belluomini, who then signed up for
a third Medicare HMO, which promised to keep her at Sequoia.
</P>
<P>
   Belluomini's problems illustrate the challenges many seniors
have felt in recent months, as several leading HMOs have canceled
contracts covering some 11,000 of the 308,000 Bay Area seniors
enrolled in Medicare HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, everyone is trying to figure out what is going
to happen now,'' &LR;   &LR; said Pat Luby, legislative representative for
the American Association of Retired Persons in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   This game of musical chairs wasn't what the federal government
envisioned a few years ago when it started urging seniors to join
HMOs to cover costs that aren't paid by basic Medicare. Before HMOs
came along, seniors who wanted coverage for such unpaid costs had
to buy supplemental insurance, or Medigap policies.
</P>
<P>
   Today, about 95 percent of 3.6 million seniors in California
have supplemented Medicare either through a Medicare HMO or a
Medigap policy. According to Luby, about 38 percent of California
seniors have taken the HMO option.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  However, with Medicare expenses soaring 15 percent a year,
Congress and the president have been trying various means to curb
the growth of Medicare spending, in part by trimming payments to
Medicare HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers blamed those federal budget cuts for prompting last
year's policy cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The future of Medicare HMO funding appears unsettled in the
year ahead as federal authorities continue to tinker with the
formulas by which they pay HMOs to treat Medicare patients.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``Short term we may see some (new policy) cancellations,''
said Walter Zelman, president of the California Association of
Health Plans, the trade group that represents HMOs. ``But long term
I expect to see HMOs and lawmakers reach accommodation, with the
result being more health plans participating in Medicare HMOs
rather than less.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, given the short-term uncertainty, seniors should review
all their options, to decide whether they're better off sticking
with a Medicare HMO _ if they have one _ or whether they should
switch to a Medigap policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are calling and they're worried,'' said Bonnie Burns,
director of education for the Health Insurance Counseling and
Advocacy Program.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by the California Department of Aging, HICAP offices
provide free, one-on-one counseling to seniors who have health
insurance questions. HICAP centers offer set &LR; private appointments,
where trained volunteers can review all personal circumstances _
including pre-existing conditions, finances, prescription needs _
and offer recommendations on the best insurance options.
</P>
<P>
   Adults who care for aged parents can also call HICAP to get a
referral to a counselor who can help them in person, by phone or by
mail.
</P>
<P>
   Burns said anyone affected by a Medicare HMO cancellation, who
hasn't already made some other insurance arrangement, should
contact a HICAP office immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Until early March, seniors have a legal right to get coverage
for pre-existing conditions if they transfer to certain alternate
types of Medicare insurance. After the March deadline, this right
expires and coverage of pre-existing conditions could be difficult
to obtain.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of MEDICARE () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Even seniors unaffected by the recent turmoil _ not to mention
people nearing Medicare eligibility for the first time _ might be
wise to review their health insurance choices.
</P>
<P>
   Those choices begin with an understanding of how Medicare works.
Enacted in 1965, Medicare provides two types of coverage, Part A
and Part B, to people 65 and older. Some disabled people under 65 _
those covered by Social Security disability payments _ are also
eligible for Medicare. Medicare Part A is paid for through taxes.
It covers the first 60 days of hospitalization, the first 20 days
in a skilled nursing facility, and certain other institutional
care, some of which requires co-payments.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare Part B covers most of the expenses involved in visiting
a doctor or specialist, getting medical tests, or outpatient care.
Part B is not free. Seniors must pay a monthly premium ($45.50 in
1999) for this coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In the event they become sick, however, and require long
hospital stays or specialized treatment, even seniors covered by
Medicare Part A and Part B could still find themselves responsible
for thousands of dollars of co-payments, as well as prescription
drugs, which Medicare doesn't cover.
</P>
<P>
   To protect themselves against these expenses, many seniors can
choose between a Medicare HMO, or Medicare supplement insurance,
often called a Medigap policy.
</P>
<P>
   These choices are very complex, which is why HICAP offers
personal counseling. But here essentially are the advantages and
disadvantages of each option.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a Medicare HMO in your area, it will generally cover
Medicare deductibles and copayments, as well as offer partial
payment for prescription drug. To be eligible to join a Medicare
HMO, the senior must already be paying for Medicare Part B. The
good news is, many Medicare HMOs don't require any additional
premium if you join. That is because Medicare pays the HMO from
$570 to $2,000 per month to cover the senior's Medicare expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare HMOs, though, do have some restrictions, notably that
patients must use  &LR; only &UR;  &LR; those doctors and hospitals approved by
the HMO. If you've spent years visiting a doctor or hospital that
isn't in the HMO's coverage area, then you've got the sort of tough
choice that the Belluomini family faced.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping for a Medicare HMO is easy. The Health Care Finance
Administration, the federal agency which oversees Medicare, has a
Web site that shows every Medicare HMO in your area (provided they
cover your locale). Visit  &LR; www.medicare.gov &LR;  and click on
``Medicare Compare.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course there are places, notably rural areas, where there are
no Medicare HMOs. Other areas have only one HMO.
</P>
<P>
   But even in the Bay Area, where several Medicare HMOs compete,
there are reasons some seniors might opt for the other choice: a
Medigap policy.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, seniors who vacation overseas or out-of-state more
than once a year might be better served by a Medigap insurance
policy that pays for medical services anywhere. Seniors who stay at
home, on the other hand, might still nix HMOs that don't let them
keep their favorite doctors or hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   In these cases a Medigap policy may be the best way to pick up
some or all of the Part A and Part B deductibles, and some
prescription costs, which basic Medicare generally doesn't cover.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, seniors shopping for a Medigap policy face a
perplexing array of choices. There are 10 different types of
Medigap plans, each of which covers different parts of the Part A
and Part B deductibles, and/or prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Medicare HMO site, there is no place to get
price-comparison information about Medigap plans, according to
Burns, the HICAP expert. Seniors must rely instead on HICAP or
insurance agents to show them the options.
</P>
<P>
   Burns feels that approach leaves too much room for high-pressure
sales tactics. He would like the California Department of Insurance
to do what most other states have done _ collect all policy and
price information in one spot, so seniors can read over all the
available options.
</P>
<P>
   But Amy Zajac, aide to state Insurance Commissioner Chuck
Quackenbush, said it isn't practical for California to mimic
smaller states like Wisconsin or Kansas, and become a one-stop-shop
for Medigap information. ``That's what insurance agents do,'' she
said.

 Schwab Expanding Premium Services  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. soon will roll out a greatly expanded version
of its premium service for top customers, officials of the San
Francisco brokerage said.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning next month, Schwab, the world's largest discount and
online broker will begin offering its premium services to customers
who keep as little as $100,000 in assets with the firm or who place
trades as few as 12 times a year.
</P>
<P>
   That represents about one of four Schwab clients _ about 25
percent of account holders _ and is much broader than the existing
premium program, which is open only to customers who have accounts
of $500,000 or more, or trade 24 times annually.
</P>
<P>
   The new initiative, called Schwab Signature Services, will offer
three levels of premium service with increasing levels of personal
attention.
</P>
<P>
   At all levels, the main benefit will be greater ease getting
through to the company by phone and computer. That's important
because Schwab customers sometimes face long waits on the phone or
online when stock trading is heavy.
</P>
<P>
   ``By making it easier to access Schwab and to customize
services, we want to give people incentive to keep their money with
Schwab,'' said Jamie Moldafsky, vice president for affluent
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab officials describe the Signature program as one of their
most important initiatives this year. Planning documents for the
program note that 25 percent of Schwab's customers account for more
than 80 percent of the firm's revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our growth is centered around the emerging affluent Baby
Boomer,'' said Executive Vice President Daniel Leemon, Schwab's
chief strategist.
</P>
<P>
   To keep such customers happy, Schwab will use ``more and finer
segmentation'' centering on ``special services for our most
affluent clients,'' Leemon said.
</P>
<P>
   As Schwab customers accumulate wealth, they seek special help in
making investment decisions, company officials said. Signature
features, including access to special teams of brokers, are
designed to address that need for investment help.
</P>
<P>
   Private banks and brokerages such as Merrill Lynch covet
Schwab's wealthiest clients, hoping to lure them with promises of
personal attention and investment advice not traditionally
available from discount brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts warn that Schwab could suffer a steady drain of such
clients, who might keep accounts at Schwab but take most of their
money to brokers prepared to individually tailor investment
programs for them.
</P>
<P>
   With Signature, ``what Schwab is trying to accomplish is to
encourage their customers to bring them more of their assets,''
said J.P. Morgan Securities analyst Michael Freudenstein.
</P>
<P>
   Customers with a minimum of $100,000 in assets or 12 trades a
year are eligible for the basic Signature program. It will give
clients a special toll-free telephone number that puts them at the
front of the line for reaching company representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Clients also will be able to log on to a Signature Internet site
offering investment research features not available to regular
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The next level, called Signature Gold, is available to clients
with $500,000 or more in assets or at least 24 trades annually. It
offers many of the same benefits as Schwab's existing premium
program, plus a few new wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   As with the current program, Gold customers will be able to call
a special team of brokers that are more highly trained than regular
representatives. A new feature will be introductions to staff at
the nearest branch to reinforce the point that clients can get
personal attention there.
</P>
<P>
   Gold customers also will get such special services as Wall
Street research over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The top premium service level, Signature Platinum, adds features
such as priority access to public stock offerings. And Schwab will
extend Platinum privileges to family members of clients.
</P>
<P>
   The danger in promoting premium services is that regular
customers may feel they are getting second-class treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab officials said they recognize the problem and will take
steps to keep such customers loyal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at alternatives for our regular investors, such
as new programs for beginning investors,'' Moldafsky said.

 Netscape's Andreessen Joining Ranks of AOL  &HT;       
 By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Marc Andreessen, the Internet boy wonder who co-founded Netscape
Communications Corp., is taking his technical wizardry to America
Online, which acquired his company last year.
</P>
<P>
   Andreessen, 27, will join AOL as chief technology officer when
the $4.2 billion merger of the online titans closes next month,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he is followed by anyone else from Netscape's executive
team is uncertain, however.
</P>
<P>
   Andreessen, who oversaw Netscape's software development, is
expected to spearhead AOL's use of fast-changing interactive
technologies but will not oversee any of AOL's day-to-day technical
operations. He will report directly to AOL chief executive Steve
Case, according to the Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to helping AOL and Netscape integrate their
technologies as the combined company faces Microsoft, Yahoo, Excite
and others in the fledgling Internet market, Andreessen's
appointment is rife with symbolism.
</P>
<P>
   AOL officials hope the hiring averts a potential brain-drain at
Netscape, where engineers historically dismissed AOL as the
``McDonald's of cyberspace'' _ a high-tech lightweight that catered
to the lowest common denominator.
</P>
<P>
   Andreessen has dropped his disdain for AOL after concluding that
Silicon Valley companies did not pay enough attention to what
average consumers wanted. ``A lot of people were wrong about AOL,''
he said in a telephone interview in November. ``They gave the
public what it wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Andreessen _ who is considered a driving force behind the Web's
explosion because he created the first graphical Web browser while
still a student at the University of Illinois _ will shuttle
between AOL's Dulles, Va., headquarters and Netscape's campus in
Mountain View. His role is considered crucial to merging AOL's
consumer-oriented focus with Netscape's technical expertise.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``It sends a reassuring signal to Netscape's engineers that
AOL is serious about technology, and it maintains Andreessen's
valuable cachet as an articulate spokesman for the company to the
outside world,'' said Jim Balderston of Zona Research in Redwood
City.
</P>
<P>
   Still up in the air is whether anyone else from Netscape's
executive offices will join AOL.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape chief executive Jim Barksdale is penciled in to serve
on the merged company's board of directors, pending the deal's
approval. Barksdale will not be involved in day-to-day operations
and is mulling future plans, including another stint as chief
executive elsewhere. Barksdale _ who already is a board member of
3Com, AtHome, Oracle's Network Computer Inc. and others _ also
might take a seat on Sun Microsystems' board, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, AOL's general counsel job is open, leaving Netscape
legal head Roberta Katz in line to replace AOL's George Vradenburg,
who recently was promoted to senior vice president for global and
strategic policy. AOL's acting general counsel is Sheila Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Some question if Katz will stick around, though. She was
personally recruited by Barksdale at Netscape after he accepted the
position of CEO in 1995 and is extremely loyal to him. Previously,
the two worked at McCaw Cellular Communications before its $12
billion merger with AT&AMP;T in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   AOL and Netscape officials cannot comment until their merger is
completed.
</P>
<P>
   This much is clear about AOL's takeover of Netscape: Bob
Pittman, AOL chief operating officer, likely will oversee Netscape
from his Virginia office.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly, the heads of Netscape's two product divisions _ Mike
Homer, responsible for Netcenter, Netscape's popular Web site that
reaches 20 million people; and Barry Ariko, who is in charge of
enterprise software _ will report to Pittman.
</P>
<P>
   Pittman, a co-founder of MTV, is credited with pioneering the
``selling of eyeballs'' to advertisers. AOL currently boasts 15
million paid subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape, founded in 1994 by Andreessen and Silicon Valley
veteran Jim Clark, burst onto the spotlight by developing the first
commercial Web browser for navigating the Internet, based on
Andreessen's earlier work at the University of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   But the company has been badly damaged the past few years by the
hardball marketing tactics of Microsoft, which gave away its
competing browser for free.

 Intel Backs Off on Chip With ID   By Dan Fost 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Under threat of a boycott, Intel Corp. backed down slightly
yesterday from a controversial plan to add a security feature to
its computer chips, but privacy advocates said the change doesn't
go far enough to ease their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy groups fear that the new feature, sort of a social
security number hard-wired into computers, would be used to monitor
Internet users' activities online, allow companies to collect
marketing data on them.
</P>
<P>
   The Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington, D.C.,
and Junkbusters, a New Jersey high-tech lobbying organization, not
only renewed their call for a boycott of all Intel products, but
EPIC may ask the federal government to order Intel to recall some
chips. Representative Edward Markey (D-Mass.) joined the fray,
calling on Intel to change its chips.
</P>
<P>
   Although computers containing Pentium III chips are not due in
stores until next month, activists fear that some of the chips have
been shipped to computer-makers already, before Intel could fix the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   EPIC is thinking of writing to the Federal Trade Commission
today to ask Intel to recall all Pentium IIIs that have shipped
already.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a ``processor serial number'' that Intel, the
world's largest chipmaker, unveiled last week. Under the company's
plan, a unique 96-digit number would go on every Intel
microprocessor sold, to help Internet companies identify users who
visit their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Intel said the new feature is designed to safeguard users'
security when they shop or bank online. ``Ultimately, the goal is
to create this trusted virtual world, and bring it on as quickly as
we can,'' Pat Gelsinger, an Intel vice president, said at a
briefing last week at the Westin Hotel in Santa Clara, a few miles
from the company's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantages of the increased security come along with some
privacy concerns,'' acknowledged Intel spokesman Tom Waldrop.
</P>
<P>
   Waldrop said the company had been meeting with privacy groups
before it announced the serial- number plan last week.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Intel made its announcement, negative reactions began to
snowball, and the company started to retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Under the change announced yesterday, Intel said the serial
number would now be turned off, unless the user turns it on. Under
the initial plan, the number would have been turned on all the
time. Even if users turned it off, it would have automatically
turned back on every time they restarted their computers.
</P>
<P>
   But groups that monitor computer privacy said they don't trust
Intel, the rest of the computer industry or rogue hackers, any one
of whom could use the number to track the activities of Internet
users, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If some so-called feature can be turned off just with a piece
of software, that means any system cracker worth his salt can turn
it on with a Trojan (horse) or a virus,'' said Stanton McCandlish,
program director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   EPIC director Marc Rotenberg said the identity number is even
worse than ``cookies'' _ software that Web sites store on surfers'
computers to track their online behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is cookies on steroids. It's the nuclear cookie,
hard-wired into every user's computer, making it easier to identify
people who are using the Internet,'' Rotenberg said. Intel said it
would make the feature available to other chipmakers, so they could
use it in their chips. But Intel's competitors say they have no
plans to include the ID numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the world is going, you want to have secure access to
the Internet any time anywhere,'' said Steve Tobak, vice president
for marketing at National Semiconductor, which makes Cyrix chips.
``You don't want to be tethered to a desktop or a processor to have
secure access.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of INTEL26 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Advanced Micro Devices also said it has no plans to include the
feature, although it would consider doing so if computer-makers
asked it to.
</P>
<P>
   One computer security expert said the controversy is not without
irony. In the view of Bruce Schneier, author of the book ``Applied
Cryptography'' and president of Counterpane, a Minneapolis computer
security firm, the Intel chip does nothing to make computers more
secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who knows how can get around it. Anybody who doesn't
know gets their privacy violated,'' Schneier said.
</P>
<P>
   On EPIC's Web site, the organization posted a logo mocking the
popular ``Intel Inside'' insignia, saying instead, ``Big Brother
Inside.''

SUPERBOWL NOTEBOOK: GRIFFITH CLEARS THE PATH FOR DAVIS; REEVES
QUICKLY IRRITATED; PARCELLS SHOPPING FOR COACH?; AFTER YOU,
GASTON?; BONUS BABIES; HINES MEETS BARYSHNIKOV
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ He is small, heavy and does the grunt
work. And that alone qualified Howard Griffith to go out with the
offensive linemen Monday night at the hard-to-get-into Joe's Stone
Crab _ the restaurant where you have to know somebody before they
let you wait on line for 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   On a Broncos team that scored 501 points this season, Griffith
scored a mere six rushing the ball. Yet on Sunday, he will be in on
many running plays against the Falcons in Super Bowl XXXIII,
although he will have hit the ground long before Terrell Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith is the fullback to Davis' tailback. Griffith ran all of
four times this season (losing ground three times) while Davis
amassed his 2,000-yard campaign on 392 carries. And while Davis was
running, Griffith often helped clear the path. Six Broncos, in
fact, carried the ball more times than Griffith did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I run into people,'' explained Griffith, a 6-footer
who weighs 232 pounds and is in his fifth season. He admitted that
it was tough to accept that role at first after being the Illinois
record-holder for touchdowns in a season and career, as well as for
single-game yardage.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you're honest with yourself,'' Griffith said, ``you
know you weren't going to be the guy. I had to hone my blocking
skills.''
</P>
<P>
   He has done them so well that he says he is now more comfortable
going out with the offensive lineman, and they with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take a couple of special cases every now and then,'' left
guard Mark Schlereth said. ``He's like an honorary offensive
lineman.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves Quickly Irritated
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Falcons Coach Dan Reeves expressed irritation Monday
when asked for the second straight day about his strained
relationships in Denver with Mike Shanahan, then Reeves' assistant,
and quarterback John Elway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through that yesterday,'' Reeves said curtly at the
Airport Hilton Hotel, after the Falcons' first practice in Florida.
``And I don't need to be scratching cuts. I'm not talking about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   To his questioner, Reeves glared down from the podium and said,
``I got that from you yesterday, didn't I?'' Then the coach turned
to a packed room of news media and snapped, ``We've got one more
question after this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan, now the Broncos' head coach, and Elway both have
indicated that although they had problems with Reeves when he
coached the Broncos, they are concentrating on Sunday's Super Bowl
matchup between Atlanta and Denver. Reeves on Sunday apologized for
re-opening the wound with several comments last week.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells Shopping for Coach?
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom has been that the Jets' coaching staff
will remain intact for next season. That, however, may not be the
case; Coach Bill Parcells has interviewed at least one offensive
coach within the past few weeks about joining his staff, according
to several National Football League coaches who spoke on condition
of anonymity. They would not identify the coach for fear of
upsetting Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   When Parcells recently contacted the potential candidate, the
coaches said, he did not specify what position he wanted him to
oversee, but the candidate has coached almost every offensive
position, including quarterbacks, the coaches said.
</P>
<P>
   The theory in the coaching community is that one of Parcells'
offensive assistants is considering taking a job with another team
and that Parcells is simply thinking ahead. Or, that Parcells is
unhappy with one of his assistants and is preparing to make a
change.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Parcells' thinking is not known because he isn't
telling potential candidates what he wants to do. Parcells could
not be reached for comment. A team spokesman said that he had no
knowledge of any change Parcells might be making on his staff.
</P>
<P>
   Next month in the Pro Bowl, the Jets' coaching staff will lead
the AFC against the National Football Conference all-stars, coached
by the staff of the Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   After You, Gaston?
</P>
<P>
   Falcons wide receiver Terance Mathis had settled down a day
after loudly complaining about Coach Dan Reeves' idea to allow the
Falcons' Pro Bowl players and 10-year veterans to exit the airplane
first when the team landed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a team,'' Mathis had yelled to Reeves. ``This is not the
time to think as individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   By Monday, Mathis had shifted his emphasis back to Sunday's
game.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive back Ray Buchanan said: ``We love him no matter what.
He could run around in his jock strap and this team would go ahead
and huddle around him and say, `Terance, man, come on. Let's not
cause any more distractions.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bonus Babies
</P>
<P>
   In addition to wanting to win the Super Bowl because of
professional pride, as well as an intense dislike of each other,
Denver Coach Mike Shanahan and his Atlanta counterpart, Dan Reeves,
have another incentive _ cash.
</P>
<P>
   If Shanahan, one of the wealthiest coaches in football, wins
Super Bowl XXXIII, he will earn a $500,000 bonus, according to
people familiar with Shanahan's contract. Reeves, who like Shanahan
is both general manager and coach, is believed to have a similar
clause in his contract and could also earn that much.
</P>
<P>
   Incentive clauses related to regular-season, playoff and Super
Bowl victories are common in the contracts of head coaches.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if Minnesota Vikings Coach Dennis Green had won the
Super Bowl, he would have got an extra $375,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hines Meets Baryshnikov
</P>
<P>
   Jamal Anderson surveyed the scene with his hand-held video
camera. Anderson, the ebullient All-Pro Falcons running back,
wanted to set the record straight. He said he did not deserve the
recognition for creating the ``dirty bird'' _ the Falcons' end-zone
dance.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, it was his teammate, tight end O.J. Santiago.
``O.J. is like Jermaine Jackson,'' Anderson said. ``He put it on
the national map. I'm like Michael Jackson, I made us platinum.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to describe the dance, Anderson said, ``It's Gregory Hines
meets Baryshnikov.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said he welcomed the two-week rest between the victory
over the Vikings in the NFC championship game and this Sunday's
Super Bowl and called the Falcons' trip here ``a business trip.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have business to do,'' he said. ``There's no hoopla.''

 EBay, Auction Sites Subject of Fraud Investigation  &HT;       
 By Jamie Beckett 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
At least two law enforcement agencies are investigating alleged
fraud on eBay and other Internet auction sites after consumers
complained that they had been cheated.
</P>
<P>
   New York City consumer authorities confirmed yesterday that they
are ``actively investigating complaints regarding alleged
fraudulent sales'' at online auctioneers.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Post reported that city officials are looking into
sales of sports memorabilia on eBay in which supposedly
one-of-a-kind items were sold to more than one person. City
officials are said to be holding eBay responsible because it
collects commissions on sales.
</P>
<P>
   EBay's position has been that it is an innocent middleman.
Although it may assist consumers who believe that they have been
fraud victims, the San Jose company urges them to work with law
enforcement agencies. Yesterday, eBay issued a statement saying it
will ``offer to fully cooperate with any investigation involving
improper items on the site.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has hosted some 43 million auctions since it
was founded in 1995, recently added new safety tools to protect
customers.
</P>
<P>
   In Pennsylvania, the state attorney general's office said
consumers in 20 states will be reimbursed for Furbys they bought on
eBay from a seller who is accused of not delivering the popular
toys.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Jamison T. Piatt of Mocanaqua, Pa.,
advertised the sale of nearly 500 Furbys at $60 apiece, which he
promised to deliver in time for Christmas. He accepted payments
from dozens of bidders but delivered less than 10 Furbys, according
to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ripped people off from New York to California,'' said
Barbara Petito of the Pennsylvania attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of a settlement, Piatt will pay more &UR;  &LR; than $2,600 in
restitution to 29 customers, deliver two Furbys to one customer and
pay $1,000 for civil penalties and investigation costs. Piatt, who
also was known as George Williams or George Lijerus, also agreed to
pay additional restitution on all legitimate complaints against him
filed within 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania authorities said they are investigating other cases
of alleged fraud on eBay, and they expect to file additional
complaints. The enforcement action against Piatt was their first
involving illegal Internet trade.
</P>
<P>
   The actions come a little more than a week after eBay, the
nation's most popular online auction site, tightened its security
and stiffened penalties for fraud. The company, which hosts
auctions selling everything from baseball cards to Beanie Babies,
in March plans to start a user-identification program allowing
consumers to register their driver's license, Social Security
number and date of birth for $5. The program is designed to let
eBay users identify fellow traders.
</P>
<P>
   EBay also will provide free insurance through Lloyd's of London
for transactions valued at $25 to $200.
</P>
<P>
   According to eBay, fraud occurs only in about 27 of every 1
million transactions.
</P>
<P>
   There are many ways consumers can be cheated. Besides paying for
goods never delivered or receiving goods that don't match product
descriptions, auction users have complained of such practices as
``shill bidding,'' in which sellers bid on their own merchandise to
drive up prices.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Dodd, founder of AuctionWatch, a Web site where auction
users post messages and complaints, said auction sites are ripe for
fraud because it is so easy to be anonymous on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for you to get a new driver's license and become a
new person,'' he said. ``On the Web, all you have to do is go to
hotmail.com (or other sites providing free e-mail) set up a new
e-mail account and you're a new person.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; FOR MORE INFORMATION
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  Consumers who believe that they have been sold fraudulent
merchandise online can contact the New York City Department of
Consumer Affairs at (212) 487-4444 or at
 &LR; www.ci.nyc.ny.us/consumers. &LR;  Consumers who purchased Furbys from
Piatt but never received them can get a complaint form at (800)
441-2555 or  &LR; www.attorneygeneral.gov. &LR;

 Exodus Continues at Montgomery  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Joseph Schell resigned as co-director of investment banking at
NationsBanc Montgomery Securities, continuing the exodus of top
managers from the San Francisco brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike several other recent Montgomery refugees, Schell, 53,
left with words of praise for the firm and its owner, North
Carolina's BankAmerica, formerly known as NationsBank.
</P>
<P>
   ``This still is a wonderful firm,'' said Schell, a 14-year
Montgomery veteran. ``It's just that it's time for new leadership
in investment banking.''
</P>
<P>
   Schell, whose resignation takes effect at the end of March, said
he decided to leave on his own. ``I've not felt pushed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery's longtime chief executive Thomas Weisel quit in
September following a dispute with NationsBank over control of key
investment banking businesses. Since then, four of the seven
members of the firm's executive committee when NationsBank took
control have resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Schell said he doesn't yet have work plans and won't join
Weisel's new investment bank, as have more than 30 former
Montgomery employees.
</P>
<P>
   Schell's departure leaves Carter McClelland, based in New York,
as Montgomery's sole head of investment banking. McClelland
formerly headed U.S. investment banking operations for Germany's
Deutsche Bank.

 No-Frills Broker Can Cut Costs  &HT;       
 By Arthur M. Louis  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I am a novice investor _ what you would call a ``little
guy.'' I recently bought and sold small amounts of Dell Computer,
Cisco Systems and Applied Materials, all at a good profit. The
total selling price was $2,150, or $839 more than I paid. Those
figures do not include commissions. The commissions for the six
transactions _ three purchases and three sales _ totaled $300,
which according to my calculator is 36 percent of my profit. How
does my broker dare to take such a big cut? I bought on the basis
of my own research and intuition, and I took all the risk.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; Answer: &LR;  Your broker doesn't care how big a profit you made
_ or whether you made one at all. If you buy or sell stocks, he is
going to collect enough commissions to cover his costs and
overhead. If you feel cheated now, just wait until you pay a
commission on a money-losing sale.
</P>
<P>
   If you do all your own research, you might as well switch to a
no-frills, online discount broker, to hold your commissions down.
None of them is going to charge you anywhere near $50 per trade _
your average for those six transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The low-price discounter _ Brown &AMP; Co., of Boston _ charges a
flat $5 per trade. It would have charged you a total of $30 in
commissions for those same six trades. Check your calculator again,
and you will find that this amounts to less than 4 percent of your
precommission profits.
</P>
<P>
   Is that low enough?
</P>
<P>
   Valuing Stock Portfolio
</P>
<P>
   Q: How does one value a stock portfolio? Isn't any valuation
illusory? Cisco Systems closed the other day at $98 per share, then
opened the next day at $90, but finished the day back up over $98.
With many other stocks, even wider fluctuations seem routine. What
are equities really worth?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Scratch any journalist and you will find a would-be
philosopher _ but I am going to resist your wide-open invitation to
bore you to death.
</P>
<P>
   Many market analysts believe that there are logical ways to
determine the proper, theoretical value of any stock, regardless of
the current market price, based on such considerations as earnings
power, book value and the inflationary and interest-rate
environment. There are many, many books on the subject that you
might find helpful. I'll mention a couple of great ones: ``The
Intelligent Investor,'' by Benjamin Graham, and ``Common Stocks and
Uncommon Profits,'' by Philip Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   However, you must get used to the fact that in the real world,
stocks, as the hardheaded J. Pierpont Morgan put it, ``will
fluctuate.`' And why not? Wouldn't you be even more puzzled if the
stock market remained static? What if Cisco stock stayed unchanged
at $103 (a more recent price) day after day?
</P>
<P>
   That would be unnatural, because Cisco is a dynamic company in a
dynamic industry in a dynamic economy. Its price mainly reflects
the sum of investor expectations about its future, which in turn
depend on the outlook for the computer networking industry and for
the economy in general.
</P>
<P>
   These expectations shift, and they can shift a lot in a hurry
when times are uncertain. Peripheral concerns such as presidential
impeachments and bombing attacks on Iraq also can shove stock
prices one way or another from day to day.
</P>
<P>
   When Full-Service Pays
</P>
<P>
   Q: In one of your columns you answered a question from a reader
who purchased stock in the same company at different times and
prices, and wanted to sell part of his holdings. You advised the
reader to tell his broker in advance which shares he wanted to
sell, and to get a written confirmation, to avoid any disputes with
the Internal Revenue Service over his cost basis. But what about
investors like myself who trade through a deep-discount online
broker and never speak to a live person?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: You're pretty much up the creek. If you can't produce
documentary evidence showing exactly which shares you sold, you
will get an argument if the IRS decides to audit you _ and you
won't win.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS won't make special allowances for people who trade
through faceless, online brokers, says spokesman Jesse Weller.
</P>
<P>
   If you have no documentation, the IRS can legally insist that
the shares you sold were the earliest ones you bought. First in/
first out is the default method used to compute capital gains or
losses.
</P>
<P>
   First in/first out could increase your tax bill if you have a
big capital gain on those early shares. Given a choice, you would
want to sell shares on which you had relatively small capital gains
or, better still, capital losses that could be used to offset your
income and reduce your tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  There's nothing you can do about transactions already
completed. But if first in/first out seems likely to pinch you hard
in the future, you might consider transferring at least part of
your account to a full-service broker. It's a hassle _ but
worthwhile if the amount you can save in taxes will be
significantly greater than the extra amount you will pay in
commissions on the sale.

EDITORIAL: ISRAEL'S NEW POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Jan. 26:
</P>
<P>
   Israeli politics was long dominated by two traditional party
groupings, Labor on the social democratic left and Likud on the
nationalist right. But that pattern began to crumble in the last
elections three years ago, when 48 percent of the vote went to
smaller, special-interest parties, several of which joined Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
   With Israel now entering a new campaign leading up to elections
May 17, the fragmentation is continuing, with more new parties
forming. One of these bears special attention. A new centrist
party, still unnamed and untested on Israel's unforgiving political
battlefield, offers hope of bridging political, cultural and social
divisions. Its central goal is to rally broad support for the
endangered Oslo peace agreements with the Palestinians. Monday the
centrists united behind a popular candidate for prime minister,
Yitzhak Mordechai, who had been defense minister until Netanyahu
dismissed him last weekend for disloyalty. Mordechai is the latest
of a recent series of prominent Likud defectors.
</P>
<P>
   One factor encouraging these realignments has been the scramble
for power of a new generation of Israeli politicians, as the
country's aging founders exit the political stage. Netanyahu, now
49, was the first of this generation to take power. Now he is being
challenged by Mordechai, who is 54, and the leader of the Labor
Party, Ehud Barak, who is 56. Another new element is that for many
Israelis, current issues like unemployment, Palestinian terrorism
and the special needs of groups like Sephardic Jews and Russian
immigrants seem more important than the division of Old World
Zionism into the rival ideological blocs of Labor and Likud.
</P>
<P>
   Both Barak and Mordechai are decorated former generals who, like
Yitzhak Rabin, bring unquestioned credibility on security issues to
their support for consolidating peace with the Palestinians.
Mordechai, an Iraqi Jew, is also Israel's first serious
prime-ministerial candidate from the long-marginalized Sephardic
community, which will probably broaden his centrist appeal. As
Israelis consider the expanding field of candidates, they should be
heartened by the many and varied choices they will face come May.

 Gore Comes Bearing Gifts for High Tech  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
In a second straight day of dispensing largesse to the high-tech
industry, Vice President Al Gore yesterday said the Clinton
administration will ask Congress for $400 million to upgrade the
global positioning system. On Sunday, Gore proposed boosting
funding for technology research by $366 million.
</P>
<P>
   GPS began as a satellite network that beamed signals to help
military ships and planes determine their exact locations. In
recent years Silicon Valley firms have adapted GPS technology for
civilian uses, like tracking fleets of trucks or helping surveyors
draw property lines.
</P>
<P>
   Under Gore's proposal, the administration would ask Congress for
money to arm GPS satellites with two new signals to expand the
system's civil, commercial and scientific use.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made the GPS announcement in a private meeting with
reporters yesterday at the Geen Mun Senior Center in San
Francisco's Chinatown, where he was lobbying for the restoration of
some health benefits for legal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   In the 30-minute interview, Gore dodged questions about his
likely presidential run, saying he hasn't yet thrown his hat into
the ring, while sounding themes sure to resonate in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling that he was a prime Senate sponsor of the federal
programs that led to commercialization of the Internet, Gore said
the new round of government-funded tech research, which he proposed
Sunday at a scientific conference in Anaheim, would make ``whole
new galaxies of products, once inconceivable, available to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Though expansive in articulating his tech vision, Gore was
equivocal on issues like how to ensure that Web businesses pay
their fair share of taxes when the current, three-year moratorium
on Internet sales levies expires.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want to stifle or hinder the most rapid possible
development of e-commerce,'' Gore said. ``At the same time, local
and state governments have a strong and legitimate interest in not
seeing the destruction of the(ir) revenue base.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the issue of liability suits arising from the Year
2000 problem, Gore said he is optimistic Congress and the
administration would agree on ``a carefully crafted compromise'' to
``protect fundamental rights'' while freeing companies from the
threat of excessive suits.
</P>
<P>
   The closest Gore came to expressing strong opinions was
came &LR; when he was asked how he would balance privacy rights with the
need to establish the identity of people in online transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe the current balance is right,'' said Gore,
adding that he has proposed an Electronic Privacy Bill of Rights to
give online consumers greater control over how information about
them is reused.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has a reputation for being virtually imperturbable,
did bristle at one parting question, about whether his chumminess
with tech executives and billionaires &UR;  &LR; would encourage a populist
challenge from a candidate within his own party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The premise of your question is that's where I'm spending my
time exclusively,'' Gore said, pointing out the Chinatown senior
center's modest surroundings as proof that ``almost every day I
meet with citizens at the grassroots level.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Even stalwart Republicans like Cisco Systems chief executive
John Chambers concede that, so far, the Clinton-Gore administration
has had the inside track in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``The administration is well ahead of the Republicans in
understanding the role technology would have in the future of our
country, competition and jobs, and therefore in their ability to
get elected,'' Chambers said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said Republicans like Texas Governor George Bush have
begun to ``understand and catch up'' on high-tech issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, I don't think either party has a lock on
Silicon Valley,'' Chambers said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican political strategist Dan Schnur cq  &LR; said Gore has
shown himself willing to use the advantages of his office to
outmatch Republican visitors to the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore's biggest advantage is he can carry around the federal
budget surplus in his wallet and hand it out to political
targets,'' Schnur said.

 Chevron Profits Slip on Cheap Oil  &HT;       
 By Rebecca Smith 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Stung by low prices for its products, Chevron Corp. posted
fourth-quarter earnings of $431 million yesterday, half as much as
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, though, were optimistic about the oil giant's
prospects in the long term, saying continued cost-cutting will help
it rebound when oil prices and global demand for fuels firm up.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, earnings were down 39 percent to $1.97 billion
($3.01 per share) on revenues of $30.6 billion that were off 27
percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers were relatively good, considering the oil and gas
situation,'' said energy analyst Edward Maran of A.G. Edwards in
New York. ``They're right on target with cost-cutting.''
</P>
<P>
   Chevron reduced operating costs by $600 million last year, it
said, and expects to take another $500 million worth of expense out
of its system by year's end. Since 1991, it has chopped $2.4
billion from its cost structure.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Chevron remains the subject of takeover
speculation, since the proposed merger of Exxon and Mobil was
announced late last year, but Chevron's relatively strong showing
still indicates it's more likely to be an acquirer than the firm
acquired.
</P>
<P>
   The company refuses to discuss merger opportunities with
outsiders but Chairman Kenneth Derr previously has said he doesn't
believe in mergers inspired by a desire to be the biggest.
</P>
<P>
   The company's main problem continues to be low prices for its
raw and finished products. In 1998, the average price fetched for
Chevron crude oil dropped 35 percent to $11.42 per barrel. Average
natural gas proceeds dipped 17 percent to $2.02 per thousand cubic
feet.
</P>
<P>
   For the sixth consecutive year, the firm put more oil and
natural gas away in reserves than it pumped out of the ground. In
1998, it replaced 149 percent of foreign oil and gas production
through additions to proven reserves.

<P>
   Novelist &UR; Gabriel Garcia Marquez &LR; , writing from Bogota in the
weekly newsmagazine Cambio, has defended &UR; President Clinton &LR; 's
sexual relations and criticized him for his foreign relations.
Marquez is the author of ``One Hundred Years of Solitude,'' which
Clinton has called his favorite book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Puritanism is an insatiable vice that feeds on its own s_,''
Marquez said about critics of the president's sexual escapades.
``... The president only wanted to do what every man has done and
hidden from his wife since the beginning of time.'' Clinton's
problem, wrote Marquez, is that he didn't lie and continue, as
would have any ``self-respecting adulterer with his head held high.
Unfortunately, he accepted his guilt with the same determination
that he had denied it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, wrote Marquez, Clinton is guilty of the
``unpardonable insanity'' of creating an international enemy to
distract the public. The writer may have been referring to recent
air strikes in Iraq, or earlier strikes in Sudan and Afghanistan.

EDITORIAL: CLOSING TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Jan. 26:
</P>
<P>
   The Senate seemed to be recovering its balance Monday after a
turbulent weekend, and in its own fashion is now moving to conclude
the impeachment trial. The precise path and timing remain unclear,
and unexpected turns remain possible until the final votes are
cast. But the message from Monday's convoluted proceedings on and
off the Senate floor was that Republicans and Democrats alike want
to bring the case, as Sen. Joseph Lieberman said, to a ``dignified
and civil'' conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Sen. Robert Byrd's motion to dismiss the charges
seems headed for defeat, the vote promises to be sobering. With
nearly all 45 Democrats expected to support the motion, the vote
will eliminate any expectation that 67 votes can be assembled to
convict and remove President Clinton. It was an affront to the
public for the Senate to debate the motion in a closed session
Monday night. But once the impeachment arithmetic is established,
the only real question that remains is finding a graceful way to
end the trial. Sen. Richard Shelby, a conservative Republican with
little affection for Clinton, pretty well captured the state of
play when he told MSNBC Monday that the House managers' case was a
dying horse that needed to be buried.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby is not the only Republican who understands that the
interests of the nation, the Constitution and the Senate, not to
mention the Republican Party, will be ill served by extending the
trial. If just a handful decide to vote with most Democrats against
calling witnesses, the next issue before the Senate, the trial
could be concluded by the end of the week. The Senate can then
approve the censure that Clinton deserves and that is the
proportional response to his misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   For all their frantic maneuvering and their improper meeting
with Monica Lewinsky on Sunday, the House impeachment managers have
failed to make the case for calling Ms. Lewinsky, Betty Currie,
Vernon Jordan and other witnesses. As Nicole Seligman, one of
Clinton's lawyers, reminded the Senate Monday, there is already a
mountain of evidence and testimony in this case compiled by Kenneth
Starr. More important, even if witnesses could strengthen specific
accusations against Clinton, that would not shake the Senate
consensus that deceit about sexual relationships is not an
impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who have set a high bar for calling witnesses are
not limited by ideology or geography. There are New England
moderates like Olympia Snowe and Jim Jeffords, Southern
conservatives like Trent Lott and Shelby and Westerners like Robert
Bennett and Slade Gorton. This should not be a matter of party
loyalty, and these and other Republicans should not let themselves
be buffaloed by the House. The hour approaches when the Senate can
vote yea or nay on the articles of impeachment, and Rep. Henry Hyde
can, as he promised Monday, lead his fellow House managers gently
into the night.

JUMPING THROUGH LOOPHOLES: SEX-SHOP CRACKDOWN HAS A HIT-AND-MISS
EFFECT
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Six months after Mayor Rudolph Giuliani began the
most aggressive crackdown on topless bars, peep shows and adult
video stores in New York City's history, Dean Richards surveyed
Ten's World-Class Cabaret in Manhattan on a recent night. Two
dancers performed slow stripteases, and scores of others circulated
among the male customers. One woman with a bottle of lotion offered
$20 neck rubs.
</P>
<P>
   Richards, a general manager at the club, watched as a
businessman sitting a few feet away paid $20 for a lap dance. Clad
only in panties and pumps, a dancer undulated above the man,
leaning about a foot from his upturned face. ``That's as close as
she'll go,'' Richards said, attesting to the club's sense of
propriety. But then the dancer leaned closer, drawing within inches
of the man's nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' Richards said, wincing, ``is too close.''
</P>
<P>
   From the lap dance lounge at Ten's to every other adult
establishment in the city, Giuliani's anti-porn crusade has placed
the X-rated industry very much on the defensive. Even so, it
remains very much alive, and, in most cases, open for business.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, after the city began enforcing a new zoning law
intended to close down adult businesses, the mayor predicted that
two-thirds of the city's 144 X-rated establishments would close
within a year, with the rest confined to remote, city-sanctioned
zones. But, at least so far, Giuliani's vision of order through
municipal might is unrealized.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the X-rated landscape is a crazy quilt shaped largely
by court rulings that have exposed loopholes in the zoning law.
Many larger clubs have litigated and stayed open, while smaller
clubs have been less successful. The city has closed down a number
of establishments in residential areas of Queens and Brooklyn, but
adult businesses in Manhattan have generally fared better.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Ten's, for example, successfully argued that the
club falls outside the definition of adult entertainment because it
admits supervised minors. Like many others, Harmony on Christopher,
a West Village adult video shop catering to gay customers,
redesigned its floor plan after the courts allowed shops to stay
open if they limited adult entertainment to less than 40 percent of
their merchandise or floor space. Now, customers can browse X-rated
videos in the basement or nonadult fare like ``The Greatest Moments
of the Goodwill Games'' ($3.95) on the ground floor.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller establishments have been harder hit. Many of them,
unable to afford legal fees, either have been forced to close down
or have done so voluntarily. Still others are struggling to survive
without topless dancing, complaining that their dancers must wear
lingerie while many wealthier clubs continue to operate unimpeded.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``You have to have the wherewithal to litigate and fend off the
city and live long enough to reap whatever benefits there are from
litigation,'' said one lawyer for X-rated establishments, who spoke
only on the condition of anonymity. ``None of the major operators
have closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Geography also appears to influence decisions. In Queens, where
several X-rated shops had operated in the heart of residential
neighborhoods, 8 of 15 cases so far have resulted in closings. But
in the most visible part of the city, Manhattan, the adult industry
has had more success. The rebirth of the newly PG-rated Times
Square captured national attention before the advent of the zoning
law, but just a block away, on Eighth Avenue, many adult video
shops, as well as peep shows like Show World, are surviving, thanks
to the 40 percent provision.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   City officials refused more than 20 requests to comment on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   The zoning law was passed in 1995, but the city had to fight
court challenges for nearly three years before it could begin
enforcing the law in late July. The law prohibited adult
establishments within 500 feet of a school, church or residential
area, or of one another, and created zones, mostly in industrial
areas, where such activity would be allowed.

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Everyone figured the NBA's free-agent feeding frenzy was going to
be chaotic, but nobody thought it would be like this.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a wild one-week period, Scottie Pippen finally landed in
Houston, Antonio McDyess went back to Denver (then reconsidered
before finally hopping on board again), Tom Gugliotta deserted
Minnesota for the desert in Phoenix, Jayson Williams reupped with
New Jersey, Damon Stoudamire did likewise with Portland, Brent
Barry followed Michael Jordan's flight path to Chicago and Derrick
Coleman deep-sixed the Sixers for Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, Charles Barkley is alive and well and back in
Houston, while Mario Elie jumped ship to join the Admiral's crew in
San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   All that's really left are the spare Rods _ Washington's Rod
Strickland, who is expected to re-sign with the Wizards, and
sure-to-be-former-Bull Dennis Rodman, who claims he is ``sick of
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Dennis, the feeling is mutual.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Latrell Sprewell, who was not a free agent but
was definitely one of the interesting parties as Golden State
shopped him everywhere, eventually agreeing to deal the disgruntled
guard to the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   But all the madness is exactly what the NBA needed after the
six-month lockout. The intrigue has created an excitement that
would have been hard to manufacture otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   So welcome back, NBA, where you can't tell 'em without a
scorecard _ or a flowchart.

41-41 season last year, but Pippen should cure what ailed them last
year. The multidimensional Pippen can do it all, even prove he can
win without Jordan. And while it hasn't received much attention
(yet), the addition of veteran power forward Antoine Carr will pay
tremendous dividends down the line. Also, the Rockets should allow
Barkley all the golf he pleases for sacrificing his contract this
year (one year, $1 million) so the Rockets could get Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen _ Finally gets the big bucks (five years,
possibly worth $82 million with incentives), winds up on a
contender and gets away from Bulls general manager Jerry Krause.
All for Roy Rogers. An injured Roy Rogers. It'll be years before
Pippen stops smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Nuggets _ Once called the No-Gets because they couldn't hold on
to anyone, Denver pulled off a mild surprise by landing McDyess,
whom the Suns very much wanted to keep. Having good friends Nick
Van Exel and John Lucas (an assistant coach) around helped McDyess
return to Denver, where he began his career. He almost
reconsidered, though, when McDyess learned the Nuggets had to waive
other good buddy LaPhonso Ellis in order to accommodate his
contract. But business is business, and McDyess is a Nugget. Again.
</P>
<P>
   Pistons _ Getting Loy Vaught paroled from Clipperland (five
years, $23 million) was huge, and if Christian Laettner, acquired
from the Hawks, gets over his torn Achilles' tendon in time for the
playoffs, both could take some of the scoring heat off Grant Hill.
The hope is that the Pistons, who also are trying to land Kevin
Johnson, will go to a more wide-open game, which is why Jerry
Stackhouse and Joe Dumars re-signed.
</P>
<P>
   Knicks _ Sprewell gives New York the offensive punch they
thought would come from past acquisitions like Allen Houston and
Larry Johnson. Capable of incredible scoring assaults, Sprewell can
also get up on anyone defensively. Along the way, the Knicks turned
in their AARP cards by getting Dennis Scott, Kurt Thomas and Marcus
Camby, a pretty good haul for what had been a collection of
creaking old bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Nets _ Re-signing Williams was mission No. 1 in New Jersey, even
though he made it a lot easier by declaring that he wasn't going
anywhere. Getting Jim McIlvaine from Seattle will not only free
Williams from doing all the dirty work inside but give him a target
for his often-outrageous barbs.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Elie _ Landed on his feet in San Antonio, where he will
provide a notoriously soft team with a warrior mentality and some
tough defense at big guard and small forward. His toughest job now
will be finding something to gripe about.
</P>
<P>
   Trail Blazers _ Managed to keep Stoudamire (seven years, $81
million) and 7-3 Arvydas Sabonis, who are not only two of the
biggest offensive threats on the team but two of its most solid
citizens, too.
</P>
<P>
   NBA owners _ Check out some of those salary figures, and compare
them to Kevin Garnett's six-year, $126 million deal with Minnesota.
'Nuff said.
</P>
<P>
   Losers
</P>
<P>
   Bulls _ Who? After years of incredible success, the NBA's answer
to the Florida Marlins begins a new era with guys like Keith Booth,
Rusty LaRue, Martin Muursepp, Bubba Wells and Barry, who signed a
six-year, $27 million deal. Gilligan's Island didn't feature this
many castaways.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Barry _ You would think he would know better, being the
son of Hall of Famer Rick Barry. Why would anyone, much less a 6-6
guard who is a former Slam Dunk champ, want to follow Jordan, whom
many consider to be the greatest player in NBA history? Think he'll
be compared to Jordan, oh, maybe once or twice this season?
</P>
<P>
   Knicks _ They dumped Charles Oakley and will field a team
featuring Sprewell, Houston, Johnson, Scott and Camby, all of whom
have to try to pry the ball away from Patrick Ewing. Pass? What's a
pass? Rebound? What's a rebound?
</P>
<P>
   Latrell Sprewell _ Does anyone else find it ironic that this guy
is expected to help the Knicks shake their tag of playoff chokers?
Anyway, good career move No. 1 was leaving the Warriors. Bad career
move No. 1 was going to New York and the relentless media
microscope, not to mention the fans' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Suns _ Not used to losing out on players they target, Phoenix
management embarrassed itself by going ballistic when McDyess had
the audacity to pick Denver over the Suns. Phoenix also wanted
Pippen but had to settle for Tom Gugliotta (six years, $58.5
million) and Luc Longley. Googs isn't exactly a booby prize, but
he's not the player the Suns coveted, either.
</P>
<P>
   Clippers _ Because they're the Clippers, they allowed Vaught to
go to Motown and lost Isaac Austin to Orlando, meaning Michael
Olowokandi, the No. 1 pick in the draft, will pretty much be on his
own.
</P>
<P>
   Antoine Walker _ Had his heart set on a $100 million deal,
possibly with the Bulls, but because of the new
collective-bargaining agreement had to ``settle'' for $71 million
from the Celtics _ barely enough to cover his cell-phone bills.
</P>
<P>
   Timberwolves _ Lost Gugliotta to Phoenix, and rumor has it that
Stephon Marbury will be next to bolt. They did manage to sign
former No. 1 pick Joe Smith, whose game can't be found with radar.
Yeah, he's the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio McDyess _ He cashed in, getting a fat contract (six
years, $67.5 million) from the Nuggets, but McDyess waffled so much
during his decision-making process that his nickname should be
``Eggo,'' turning off many suitors.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Jan. 26: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sacking of a half-dozen bribe-takers from the ranks of more
than 100 International Olympic Committee members may be good
facing-saving public relations. The promise to test a
corruption-resistant process for picking the host city for the 2006
Winter Games is welcome. But the scope of the widening scandal
suggests that the IOC president, Juan Antonio Samaranch, should
step down. Since bribery infected Olympic site selections on his
watch, he cannot now credibly supervise a cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal, which started with concerns over bribes given by
Salt Lake City boosters to secure the 2002 Winter Olympics, has now
expanded to an investigation of every site selection for the Games
between 1996 and 2006. In power since 1980, Samaranch would prefer
to retire in 2001. But all those with an important interest in the
Olympics, including prominent athletes, sports federations,
governments and corporations that spend tens of millions on the
Games to promote their products, should press for his immediate
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC is undemocratic, secretive and unaccountable. Its
delegates are not government representatives. Yet it plays a
pivotal role in the financing, marketing and selling of the Games.
Host cities invest hundreds of millions to build facilities, hoping
to create post-Games economic benefits. The television and
advertising budgets have become enormous. For these reasons, the
IOC's next leader should be an executive who can operate the
lucrative business of staging the Games ethically. An unyielding
devotion to clean and transparent business practices should match
the athletes' pursuit of the Olympic ideal.

 &HT;    Buchanan's `guarantee' shrugged off by Broncos
 &HT;    By Andy Clendennen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ Atlanta Falcons cornerback Ray Buchanan
must know something the rest of the world doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Either that or he's trying to be like Joe Namath and set the
stage for a position as a pitch man after his football career.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever the motivation, the Broncos aren't too concerned with
Buchanan's guarantee that the Falcons will win the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We concern ourselves more with our football team,'' Broncos
head coach Mike Shanahan said. ``We're not putting stuff on the
bulletin board. All we do is look at the film and talk about their
strengths. In reality, we're pretty honest with our evaluations
with their football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Broncos offensive guard Mark Schlereth, back from his
self-imposed exile from interviews, also refused to take Buchanan's
bait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he said that in jest,'' the 10-year veteran said.
``And it doesn't really matter. You have to line up and play on
Sunday, so we're going to line up and play hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all men that have a job to do and we're going to go out
and play hard. Whether you say stuff like that or you don't say
anything, the bottom line is you still have to play on Sunday. I
don't think anybody uses that as motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos' main concern right now is _ surprise, surprise _
the Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Of specific attention is NFC rushing leader Jamal Anderson and a
Falcons defense which allowed fewer than 75 rushing yards a game
this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons defense led the NFL with 44 takeaways and 25 fumble
recoveries. It also has held 12 of its 18 opponents to 20 points or
less. The 27 scored by the Vikings in the NFC championship are the
most points Atlanta has allowed in its last 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do everything,'' Schlereth said of the defense. ``They
have an excellent, excellent football team. You don't win 16 games
and not have a great defense. They do, they pose problems all over
the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a good, solid front and I truly believe we've
definitely got our work cut out for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos' defense also has some serious work to do, as
Anderson brings an impressive resume into the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to 1,846 yards rushing, Anderson also shattered the
club record with a dozen 100-yard games this year (one more than
Terrell Davis) and he also scored 16 rushing touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the total package,'' Shanahan said of Anderson.
``He's a great runner. He can break tackles, he can run right over
you and he can make a defensive back miss in the open field. That's
really a tough combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not many guys that have the power and speed to make a
big play and run over you, and at the same time have the
elusiveness to get away from a defensive back in the open field.''
</P>
<P>
   But again, Shanahan said the Broncos need to be concerned with
themselves and not get caught up in what the Falcons statistics
show or what their players may say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more concerned with our football team,'' Shanahan said.
``If we look at the film, hopefully we can prepare the right way.
If we take more pride in how we execute rather than all the other
things that go on with the other team, I think we have a much
better chance at success.''

AT MICROSOFT TRIAL, ACCOUNTS DIFFER ON DEALINGS WITH APPLE
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department's lead lawyer in the
Microsoft antitrust case clashed Monday with the company's
highest-ranking witness as the government charged that the software
maker had used its market power as ``a club'' in its dealings with
Apple Computer Inc., while the Microsoft executive countered that
his company was responding to a threat of ``patent terrorism'' from
Apple.
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting accounts of how Microsoft convinced Apple to
make Microsoft's Internet software the preferred choice over that
of its browser rival, the Netscape Communications Corp., was the
main focus of the government's early cross-examination of Paul
Maritz, a Microsoft group vice president, who took the stand Monday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But David Boies, the Justice Department's lead trial lawyer,
also questioned Maritz sharply on what he said to an executive of
the Intel Corp. and about Microsoft's intentions toward Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of dry testimony from economic experts for both
sides, the trial shifted into a higher gear, taking on the some of
the feel of a legal prize fight. Boies is a leading trial
litigator, and Maritz is the stand-in at the trial for his boss,
Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman. Both sides, it seemed, scored a
few points Monday afternoon in a cross-examination that will
continue on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the trial, the government has shown excerpts of
Gates' videotaped deposition, taken last year, showing him to be
combative, evasive and forgetful. Maritz presents a different face
of Microsoft, answering questions in his deep baritone, directly,
with clipped precision.
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, he contends that there is nothing in evidence that
really shows the company did anything other than compete vigorously
to bring consumers better products.
</P>
<P>
   In his cross-examination, Boies is seeking to discredit
Microsoft's story and to raise doubts about the credibility of its
leading corporate witness.
</P>
<P>
   Boies introduced a series of internal Microsoft e-mail to try to
show that the company's current account of its thinking in
negotiating a deal with Apple is very different from the language
of its own documents in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The government alleges that Microsoft used the threat of no
longer developing its Office productivity software for the
Macintosh _ the most widely used applications software on Apple
machines _ as a way to ensure that Apple favored Microsoft's
Internet Explorer. Microsoft replies that the main consideration in
an August 1997 deal with Apple _ which continued Office development
and gave Microsoft's browser preferential status _ was to settle a
lingering patent dispute with Apple.
</P>
<P>
   Boies presented Maritz with a series of e-mails, including one
from Gates to Maritz on June 23, 1996, identifying ``two key
goals'' in dealing with Apple. One was to keep a high share of the
market for applications software on Macintosh machines, and the
second, Gates wrote, was to ``get them to embrace our Internet
Explorer in some way.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates did mention the patent issue in the e-mail, but only as an
aside later in the message.
</P>
<P>
   Maritz replied to that e-mail, and other similar messages, by
saying that resolving the patent issue was an underlying theme in
all negotiations with Apple. ``He didn't have to tell me,'' he said
of one message from Gates. ``It was a constant refrain that unless
we settle the patent issue nothing else goes forward.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For years, Apple had claimed that Microsoft's industry-standard
Windows operating system and Office programs violated Apple's
patent rights. With Apple's fortunes declining sharply, Maritz
said, Microsoft feared that Apple would try to cash in with a
desperate patent suit, possibly seeking an injunction to stop
Microsoft from shipping its main products, Windows and Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were concerned what in the industry is called patent
terrorism,'' Maritz testified. ``You're dealing with a company in
danger of going out of business, and there is no way of using your
patents in defense because they essentially have no business
left.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies also questioned Maritz sharply on whether he ever told a
group of Intel executives that Microsoft's plan for competing with
Netscape was to ``cut off their air supply'' and that ``everything
they're selling, we're going to give away for free.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the trial, an Intel executive testified that Maritz
had made that statement in a meeting with Intel executives in
September 1995. But in his written trial testimony, released last
Friday, Maritz denied ever saying any such thing.
</P>
<P>
   Boies presented Maritz with his deposition testimony taken last
October. When asked about the comment, Maritz replied that ``it's
possible but I just don't recall.''
</P>
<P>
   Maritz said he sharpened his denial after reviewing the matter
in preparation for his trial appearance. Boies replied that the
quotation appeared in an article in The New York Times in January
1998, long before his deposition was taken.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Maritz replied, but added that back then it was not
attributed to him but only to ``a Microsoft executive.'' In fact,
the article in The Times, on Jan. 12, 1998, quoted an Intel
executive who attributed the remark to Maritz by name.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By the time Republicans senators trickled into
their 10 a.m. meeting Monday, the stage had been set and the script
had been written for a way to end the impeachment trial of
President Clinton, possibly in a matter of days.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Monica Lewinsky had come to town, setting off
agitated scrums of reporters and gawkers that foretold the
commotion if she were to testify in the Senate. Partisan tempers
had flared, reminding senators that their hold on dignity was
tenuous.
</P>
<P>
   And two trusted ambassadors of bipartisanship _ Sen. Slade
Gorton, R-Wash., and Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn. _ had sketched
a scenario for a denouement, passing the plan on to party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But that glimmer of hope died quickly in the Republican caucus
Monday, and the reason boiled down to the same sticking point that
had proven most vexing from the outset of the proceedings: namely,
witnesses. The Gorton-Lieberman plan did not allow for them, and
many Republicans remained steadfast in their desire to call at
least a few.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard for me to envision, as a trier of fact who has
taken an oath, judging this case without seeing the most important
witness or witnesses,'' said Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, after his
party's two-hour caucus Monday. ``It is not so much a question of,
`Will this witness testify to new things?' The issue is for the
fact finder to have the full benefit of the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican determination, in the face of all the temptations
to wriggle free of the proceedings, can be traced to a variety of
factors, including a sense of obligation to give the House trial
managers their due, an antipathy to letting the president off easy
and lingering questions about some of the facts laid out in the
voluminous record of the case.
</P>
<P>
   But above all, Republican senators who continue _ at least
publicly _ to insist on witnesses cite history as the prime
motivation. They say that no previous Senate impeachment trial
bypassed witnesses on the way to a verdict, and if this one did so,
it would send the lawmakers of tomorrow the wrong message.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be setting a very bad precedent,'' Sen. Charles
Grassley, R-Iowa, said Monday, echoing an opinion that several of
his Republican colleagues had stated on televised news programs
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley explained that truncating an impeachment trial and
skipping over traditional legal steps might rob it of some gravity,
so that in the future, impeachment itself might seem a paltry
thing, easily remedied by an accelerated Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might even encourage impeachment,'' he said, ``and lend to
a political adversarial use of impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   With so much in flux Monday, it was possible that some
Republicans' hard line on the inclusion of witnesses _ or at least
a vote on their inclusion _ was a continued bargaining position, a
chip they were not quite ready to hand over to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   From certain perspectives, the tenacity of the Republican demand
for witnesses is extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   It has political peril, a reality hammered home by successive
public opinion polls in which most Americans say they want the
trial over and done with. It defies the fact that Miss Lewinsky
this weekend indicated that she had nothing new to say, and it
seemingly ignores the unwillingness of other potential witnesses,
such as Betty Currie and Vernon Jordan, to say or do anything to
hurt Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some Democrats wonder if the desire for witnesses
is simply spiteful, or a delusion among conservative Republicans
who refuse to concede that Clinton has transcended his travails yet
again. These Democrats also contend that many Republican senators
are beholden to right-wing constituents who demand a ferocious
prosecution of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Neb., said Monday that some Republicans were
apparently hoping that ``under the glare and the pressure and this
and that, some witness may contradict what he or she said before.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some Republicans like Grassley, who want witnesses have
said they are merely interested in having witnesses deposed
privately before a final decision on their testimony is made.
Others may feel it is the vote on witnesses _ not their actual
testimony of them _ that is paramount.
</P>
<P>
   The Gorton-Lieberman plan did away with that vote. It presented
a tit-for-tat compromise, with Democrats offering not to introduce
a motion to dismiss the charges against Clinton if Republicans
agreed to skip the witness vote and go directly to final arguments
and a vote on the articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But some Republicans said Monday that there were ways in which
depositions or other testimony from witnesses could clarify muddy
facts, particularly in relation to the second article, which
charges Clinton with obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Prior statements from Ms. Currie and Miss Lewinsky, for example,
contain discrepancies about whether Ms. Currie directed Miss
Lewinsky to dispose of gifts the president had given her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we want to get every clarification we can get to
make a severe judgment,'' Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, several of the House Republicans appointed to
prosecute the president, or trial managers, have repeatedly pleaded
with Republicans in the Senate to give them at least a limited
opportunity to buttress their case with the questioning of
witnesses. Some Republican senators have been moved by those
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Craig Thomas, R-Wyo., said Monday that it was only fair and
respectful to try to accommodate the managers. ``We would do the
same for the president's lawyers,'' he said.

<P>
   PARK CITY, Utah _ Forget feature films. The 15th annual Sundance
Film Festival, the nation's premier showcase of independent movies,
has been dominated by an avalanche of first-rate documentaries this
time around.
</P>
<P>
   While such movies as ``Sex, Lies and Videotape,'' ``The Usual
Suspects,'' ``Shine,'' ``Central Station'' and ``The Brothers
McMullen'' have been introduced here in years past, this time
documentaries are the focal point _ and the strongest films _ of
the packed festival in this snowy Wasatch Mountain ski resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year is probably the strongest year we've had in terms of
documentaries,'' said Geoffrey Gilmore, director for programming.
``They're much more about the subcultures of America, more about
the realities of American life than in previous years. For whatever
reason, they're less personal than in previous years. The
concentration is on subject, on content, rather than the personal
prism of the filmmaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Implicit in his comments and those of numerous producers,
distributors and filmmakers is that the feature films presented
here in recent years have often been overpromoted, and stumbled at
the box office. One top independent film executive characterized
the feature films shown so far as ``typically Sundance: very
earnest, a bit downbeat, with production values and performances
that seem strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Though often overlooked, documentaries have sometimes been the
high point of the festival: ``Hoop Dreams'' ``Crumb,'' ``Unzipped''
and ``When We Were Kings'' were first presented here. On Friday
night there was a virtual mob scene at the first screening of
``American Pimp,'' an exploration of the world of pimps and
prostitutes by Allen and Albert Hughes, twin 26-year-old filmmakers
whose previous successes include such features as ``Menace II
Society'' and ``Dead Presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a fast-food restaurant on Main Street here on Sunday
afternoon, the brothers said the movie began as a conventional
feature. While researching it, however, they changed their minds.
``We kept saying, `Why don't we use these real people: they're 10
times more interesting than anything we could have made up,'' said
Allen Hughes. ``It was a freeing experience. There's that feeling,
`I couldn't make this up even if I tried. Why not just go for
reality?'''
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of documentaries seems a result of several
factors, including a realization among filmmakers in an arduous
fund-raising environment that a few outposts on broadcast and cable
television are potentially fertile grounds for documentaries.
Several documentary filmmakers cited important support in
particular from HBO and the ``American Masters'' series on PBS.
</P>
<P>
   ``The television universe had just brought greater interest in
documentaries,'' said Freida Lee Mock, an Academy- and Emmy-winning
documentarian whose newest film, with Terry Sanders, her husband,
is ``Return With Honor,'' an account of the ordeal and heroism of
American pilots who were held as prisoners of war in North Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just getting into documentaries is not as hard as feature
films,'' she said. ``The bar is not as high in terms of the
budgets; the process is more open to women, to younger people, to
older people. It's a more democratic entryway into the filmmaking
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The documentaries being presented here, some of which will
probably be shown later this year at movie theaters, on PBS or on
HBO, deal with an almost startling array of themes. On Sunday night
the 1,300-seat Eccles Theater was packed for the premiere of ``Mr.
Death: The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter Jr,'' a bleak
documentary by Errol Morris (``Thin Blue Line,'' ``Fast, Cheap and
Out of Control'') about an ``execution technologist'' who works on
execution devices and is involved in the Holocaust denial movement.
Morris, 50, who lives in Cambridge, Mass., and earns his living
mostly making television commercials, said he first read about
Leuchter in a front-page article in The New York Times in 1990.
``I've always wanted to make a movie about the Holocaust, but not a
traditional movie,'' Morris said. ``This provided a way for me into
the story that was quite unique.''
</P>
<P>
   Why are documentaries so significant at Sundance now? ``It's the
possibility of telling stories that would not be told otherwise,''
Morris said. ``Telling stories involving real people, involving a
connection to the real world, which is very powerful.'' He
shrugged. ``Look at so many Hollywood films. They are devoid of any
intellectual ambition.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The festival program also includes Chuck Workman's documentary
``The Source,'' an exploration of the Beat Generation; Paolo di
Floro's ``Speaking in Strings,'' a portrait of the violinist Nadja
Salerno-Sonnenberg; Nanette Burstein and Brett Morgan's ``On the
Ropes,'' about three Brooklyn boxers; ``American Hollow,'' about an
Appalachian family, made by Rory Kennedy (a daughter of Robert F.
Kennedy); Michael Epstein's ``Hitchcock, Selznick and the End of
Hollywood''; Barbara Sonneborn's ``Regret to Inform,'' about
American and Vietnamese war widows; Stanley Nelson's ``Black Press:
Soldiers Without Swords,'' about the ascent of black-owned
newspapers; and Chris Smith's ``American Movie,'' about the
travails of a low-budget filmmaker, Mark Borchardt.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the glitziest documentary is ``Get Bruce,'' about
Bruce Vilanch, a madcap and campy writer for Bette Midler, Robin
Williams, Whoopi Goldberg, Billy Crystal, Roseanne and numerous
other stars who are featured in the film. Vilanch also writes for
the Academy Awards and other awards shows.
</P>
<P>
   Vilanch, interviewed in a hotel coffee shop here, said he was
approached two years ago by producer Andrew J. Kuehn after the
success of ``Unzipped,'' the movie about the fashion designer Isaac
Mizrahi.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made him think that it would be wonderful to do a movie
about another flamboyant queen,'' said Vilanch.
</P>
<P>
   Vilanch said he was initially concerned. ``If it doesn't work
out it's a career killer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is not to say that feature films have been
overlooked at Sundance. Robert Redford, the festival's patriarch,
indicated that he was a bit worried that feature films had in
recent years turned almost mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were more accomplished and less rough-edged,'' Redford
said. ``If that's the way the current independent community is
going _ more mainstream _ so be it. But we want to make sure that
space is open to the next batch of independent filmmakers who are
not as mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the feature films that have caused the most stir at this
year's festival are decidedly mainstream. Guy Ritchie's ``Lock,
Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,'' already a big hit in England, is a
funny and wicked tale about young Londoners who get involved with
local thugs. A much-anticipated film to be shown on Tuesday is
Allison Anders' ``Sugar Town,'' about the music scene in Los
Angeles, with a cast that includes Ally Sheedy and Rosanna
Arquette.
</P>
<P>
   A third film that has already caused something of a bidding war
among distributors is Mark Illsley's ``Happy, Texas,'' with the
actors William H. Macy, Steve Zahn and Jeremy Northam. It is a
comedy about two men who escape from a West Texas chain gang and
masquerade as a gay couple hired to direct a local beauty pageant.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, documentaries seem to be gathering the most
attention. ``There are no rules about documentaries: that's the
best thing,'' said Workman, whose film ``The Source'' deals with
such Beat Generation figures as Allen Ginsberg and Ken Kesey.
``It's often very personal. There's no formulaic ritual. The only
danger, really, is that they become so popular that studios will
get involved and tell you how to do it.''

EDITORIAL: WHEN AN ANCHOR'S FACE IS NOT HER FORTUNE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editorial Observer)  
 (af)  
 By ELEANOR RANDOLPH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Tuesday, Jan. 26: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In television news, as in entertainment, a pretty face can't
hurt. Still, a few, mostly belonging to the males in the business,
age more lucratively than others. Take Tom Brokaw, Dan Rather and
Peter Jennings, for example. The visual effect of gravity on these
three famous faces has been to add another layer of gravitas.
</P>
<P>
   As any woman in television is often ready to admit, usually in
private, the camera sees the aging female quite differently. For
all the talk about more baby boomers trusting their peers as TV
anchors, the top women stars have to keep stretching the fantasy
that they remain perpetually in early middle age. Lest that sound
overblown, think about our most famous TV-divas _ Barbara Walters,
Diane Sawyer, Connie Chung, Lesley Stahl and Judy Woodruff _ and
then ask yourself: Is there a gray hair among them?
</P>
<P>
   All of which brings us to the case in Hartford of a blond
television anchor, Janet Peckinpaugh, who is arguing that she was
booted from the co-anchor's chair when her managers thought they
spotted her first wrinkle. Overnight, Ms. Peckinpaugh,
Connecticut's superstar, went from being an asset to an albatross
at her CBS affiliate. The station bought out her contract and she
moved from a salary of $250,000 a year (plus a makeup consultant, a
wardrobe allowance and a hairdresser) to $45,000 for an early
morning news show at a slightly downmarket station across town.
</P>
<P>
   In a federal court case now being heard in Hartford, the
48-year-old Ms. Peckinpaugh is charging that her bosses promised in
the 1980s to allow her to age gracefully in her job because she had
rebuffed earlier offers elsewhere and remained loyal to WFSB, then
owned by Post-Newsweek Stations, a division of The Washington Post
Co. Company officials don't remember any such promises, and they
are calling this case a mere contract dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Peckinpaugh is also charging that her co-anchor Al Terzi
groped her and that after she complained, he tried to have her
bumped as co-anchor. Terzi insists that it was a fraternal hug, not
a grope, but his denial on the witness stand last week helped focus
on the very issue she has raised in court: he is a 56-year-old man
who still has both his gray hair and his job.
</P>
<P>
   Despite gains for some older women at the anchor level, what
makes Ms. Peckinpaugh's plight so disturbing is that it is not new.
The Christine Craft case in the 1980s let any aspiring young woman
know how station managers view aging blondes. After a focus group
for her Kansas City television station showed that she wasn't
drawing the customers as well as her younger sisters, Ms. Craft was
demoted. She filed for damages, which she finally lost on appeal.
The tape of one focus group shows a man suggesting that Ms. Craft
looked like a dog. ``Is she a mutt?'' he mocked.
</P>
<P>
   The sampling of public opinion is undoubtedly a little more
sophisticated these days. ``They probably don't ask which one you'd
like to have sex with anymore,'' says Ms. Craft, who is now a
lawyer and radio talk show host in California. Probably not, but in
Ms. Peckinpaugh's case, a market researcher for the station polled
shoppers at an area mall. Her job prospects slipped drastically
after they found that she ranked last among viewers in something
they labeled the ``net enjoyment score.''

AMERICAN AIRLINES PLANNING $1-BILLION EXPANSION AT JFK AIRPORT
</HEADLINE>

 By VIVIAN S. TOY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ American Airlines unveiled plans on Monday to build a
$1-billion terminal at Kennedy International Airport that will have
59 gates and a check-in area larger than Giants Stadium. Officials
touted the project as a major step toward restoring Kennedy's
reputation as the nation's premier international gateway.
</P>
<P>
   The new terminal will be designed to accommodate 40,000
passengers a day at 220 check-in counters and will ferry passengers
along moving walkways at each of three concourses. With 1.9 million
square feet of floor space, the terminal will be nearly twice as
big as Kennedy's largest existing terminal.
</P>
<P>
   While Kennedy has always moved more international passengers
than any other airport in the country, it lost much of its luster
in recent years as other airports expanded and modernized.
According to unofficial numbers from the Port Authority of New York
and New Jersey, a record 31.6 million domestic and international
passengers used Kennedy last year, but Newark International Airport
surpassed it with 32.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   David Stempler, the president of the Air Travelers Association
in Washington, a consumer advocacy group, said the new terminal
``will certainly be a help to Kennedy, which hasn't been quite
keeping up with its international counterparts in places like
Tokyo, Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam.''
</P>
<P>
   Combined with other planned construction and a new light-rail
system linking the terminals at the airport, American Airlines' new
terminal will help make Kennedy ``unrivaled by any airport
anywhere,'' said Charles Gargano, the chairman of the Empire State
Development Corp. and vice chairman of the Port Authority, which
runs Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark Airports.
</P>
<P>
   Airline officials said travel would not be disrupted by the
construction, which is scheduled to begin this July and be
completed in July 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy unveiled a $438-million new Terminal One last year, a
500,000-square-foot building that houses Korean Air, Japan Air
Lines, Air France and Lufthansa. A new $1.2 billion International
Terminal, with one million square feet of space, is scheduled for
completion in 2002 and will be home to about 30 smaller airlines.
British Airways has committed $140 million to renovating its
terminal, and Delta Air Lines is expected to announce plans soon
for its two terminals.

<P>
   LONDON _ A lawyer for Gen. Augusto Pinochet told a panel of the
Law Lords, Britain's highest court, that the former Chilean head of
state had absolute immunity from arrest, because the crimes he is
accused of were ``archetypical acts of government or sovereign
power.'' The lawyer, Clare Montgomery, led off Pinochet's defense

BIG-SPENDING GOLF FANS GET BIG PERKS

<P>
   PHOENIX _ While you're stuck in traffic, helicopters zip
big-shot golf fans to the Phoenix Open in minutes.
</P>
<P>
   While you run to snare a good spot in the gallery, people breeze
through a lane carved in the mob for a reserved place at the front
of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   When you sit on the grass with a hot dog and a soda, some golf
fans dine on catered food, relax on plush furniture and plan an
evening at a private club at the Tournament Players Club of
Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400,000 golf fans from all over the world will
converge on the TPC this week for the Phoenix Open. For many, it's
inexpensive entertainment _ a few bucks at the gate and a few more
for something to eat _ and a chance to see the world's best
golfers.
</P>
<P>
   For others, it's a big-money extravaganza, a chance to spoil
themselves, friends or clients. They'll spend hundreds, and in many
cases, thousands, for the chance to hang out at the golf course in
luxury.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're wined and dined. Wherever you go it's never ending.
There's never a tray that's not filled,'' Kenny Stein, sales
manager at Childress Buick, said of the hospitality clients at the
Arizona Buick Dealers tent at the golf course's Corporate Village.
</P>
<P>
   The Thunderbirds, the group that puts the tournament together,
don't miss a trick when it comes to marketing the event, a strategy
that raised $3 million for charity at last year's Open.
</P>
<P>
   They've packaged the Open for companies that want to show
clients a good time, creating a tent town called Corporate Village
overlooking the 18th fairway and the 17th green. Price of admission
for a company that wants to set up a tent: $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   That gives companies a big package of perks, including valet and
reserved parking, badges for the tournament and access to the
Corporate Nest, a private enclave for drinking and entertainment
that lets bigwigs avoid the raucous, crowded Bird's Nest bar.
</P>
<P>
   John Mistler, the Thunderbirds chairman for the Corporate
Village, said people invited to the tents get plenty of special
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``People do things from handing out hats to handing out golf
packages,'' he said. ``Some people fly in customers in
helicopters.''
</P>
<P>
   The tents also give companies a chance to meet clients and
potential clients in a relaxed setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can have any kind of food they want,'' Mistler said.
``You get out of the sunshine and it creates an intimate
atmosphere. You can sit down with a client or a prospect. It's a
huge networking opportunity. And you can go out on the deck and
watch the best golfers in the world go by.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies that don't need that kind of space can schmooze it up
at Sky Box Village. People lucky enough to be invited to one of the
boxes enjoy free admission to the tournament, a catered buffet,
lunch and open bar, and some get valet and reserved parking.
</P>
<P>
   The boxes have a view of the 16th and 17th fairways. And this
year the Thunderbirds offered dual-level ``penthouse'' skyboxes for
$75,000 after giving the concept a test run last year. All of the
approximately 65 boxes _ including the double-deckers _ sold out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole point is entertainment,'' said Gil Brito,
Thunderbirds Sky Box chairman. ``It's a very nice location to watch
multiple golf holes. There are places to sit, places to get food
and drink and sit down and enjoy the golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Golf fans who just want to treat themselves _ or companies that
want to hand out a valuable freebie _ can spend $1,500 for a
GolfWatch credential. The Thunderbirds say GolfWatch, a package
offered by a Colorado company, is like having a courtside seat at
an NBA game.
</P>
<P>
   A GolfWatch badge lets people zip through galleries in special
lanes. They always sit at the front of the gallery on special
portable seats.
</P>
<P>
   GolfWatchers also get access to the GolfWatch Home Pavilion near
the 18th hole. The place is set up with food, phones, satellite TV
and other services.
</P>
<P>
   ``They totally pamper their customers and take care of their
needs,'' said Rob McGarey, Thunderbirds GolfWatch chairman.
``They'll tell you what certain stocks are doing. They have a
business center out there. They'll pick you up at the airport,
hotel, arrange all the transportation. Pull into their parking lot.
They transport you right to the pavilion.''
</P>
<P>
   GolfWatch ``oases'' scattered around the course offer gourmet
snacks, TV, comfortable chairs and a full bar. The Open, which
offered GolfWatch for the first time last year, made 1,000
GolfWatch passes available this year.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, 75 percent of them were sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of corporations buy them to entertain the really top
clients,'' McGarey said.
</P>
<P>
   Stein, the Buick sales manager, is looking forward to his fourth
trip to the Open this year. He expects to run into people he met on
previous visits, and to enjoy the relaxed atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   He said there's a lot of talk about some of the perks given to
big-money golf fans, some of it overdone. He thinks it's a
``relaxed country club or polo club atmosphere'' but not knockout
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a medium to high-end grade of food,'' he said. ``From a
social standpoint I would give it a 10. You're right there. You see
the players coming by.''
</P>
<P>
   How about someone who's never seen it before?
</P>
<P>
   ``They would be impressed to the hilt,'' he said. &QL;

NEW FACILITIES EXCITE GALAXY

By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Well before Galaxy coach Octavio Zambrano
finished his morning discussion with his assistants Monday, Paul
Caligiuri dressed quickly and eagerly awaited Zambrano's arrival as
the team's first day of training began at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Rain prevented the Galaxy from running on the Rose Bowl pitch,
but it couldn't damper Caligiuri's enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great weather for soccer,'' said Caligiuri, 34. ``I
know it's raining out here, but the coolness, the freshness in the
air, you just want to play on days like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Caligiuri, a former UCLA standout, had plenty of reasons to be
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   A new weight room is being constructed only yards away from the
Galaxy's locker room where Caligiuri was standing. And the team
expects to break ground in March on a practice field to be
constructed in Lot K of the Rose Bowl parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   That's a far cry from how things went when the Galaxy trained
for the first three seasons. The team had to practice on the
parking-lot grass outside the Rose Bowl or on the bumpy turf at
Occidental College.
</P>
<P>
   The improvements are courtesy of the Galaxy's new owner, Philip
F. Anschutz, who purchased the team in October for $26 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had to overcome so many hurdles to be successful in the
past,'' Caligiuri said. ``We have never had the conditions to train
in (like) other top teams in this league have enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big missing ingredient, obviously, has been having a
training facility in one location where we can practice all the
time. Now that we are going to have that, I think, psychologically,
it's really going to elevate this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a player's standpoint, the game is so psychological. At
this stage of our careers, it's important to be able to refine your
skills (on a balanced turf) and to be excited about coming out to
play every day. The elements are there to provide us with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the rainy weather, the team was forced to hit the
weights and start with player physicals instead of endurance
training. The first day of on-field training is Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   As Zambrano sent his team to bulk up, he took a tour of his new
office, which also is under construction. The changes, he said,
will give the team a much-needed lift.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we've been yearning for for so long and
finally, it's coming together,'' Zambrano said. ``I can't say
enough about our organization right now. Our new owners are slowly
coming through with what they promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact we don't have to go too far and train is a huge
advantage we never had. I just hope that the new facility gets
built as soon as possible because we don't want to tear the Rose
Bowl pitch in the meantime.''
</P>
<P>
   Construction on the new practice field must be approved by the
City Council and the Rose Bowl Operating Co., as does the team's
new three-year contract to play in the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Cobi Jones, Robin Fraser and Clint Mathis are expected to join
the team by Thursday. The three Major League Soccer standouts were
with the U.S. national team for a friendly at Bolivia on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Hermosillo will miss training camp and at least the first
10 games of the season while he finishes his duties with his club
team in Mexico. This is no surprise to the Galaxy _ the team was
aware of the situation when he signed last season.
</P>
<P>
   With the departure of Dan Calichman (traded to New England) and
the loss of foreigners Martin Machon and Wellington Sanchez,
Zambrano expects young U.S. talent like Mathis, Steve Jolley and
Daniel Hernandez to play big roles this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are losing a little on experience,'' Zambrano said. ``But
these (three) young players can do the job just as good, if not
better.''
</P>
<P>
   With the loss of Sanchez and Machon, Los Angeles has room for a
foreign player. MLS dropped the number of foreign players each team
can have from five to four this season.
</P>
<P>
   L.A.'s foreign list is at three _ Welton (Brazil), Hermosillo
(Mexico) and Mauricio Cienfuegos (El Salvador). The chances of
landing a marquee foreigner, however, aren't good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't do much,'' Zambrano said. ``The money allocated for
us to get a foreign player is so minimal that we can't get a
big-time guy with experience because he would demand too much
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be forced to find a young player with a bright future
and hopefully that player will come into his own real soon.''

STUDENT'S STUDY OF INFLAMMATION PROPELS HIM TO SCIENCE CONTEST
FINALS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Nobody at the Bronx High School of Science much knows what
Daniel H. Grollman is talking about when he gets going on
platelet-endothelial adhesion, but the topic caught the attention
of researchers at the Cornell medical college. And Monday, it won
him nationwide attention: He was one of 40 high school students
chosen as finalists in the Intel Science Talent Search.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I'd win, but the contest was an opportunity,''
Grollman, 17, said Monday on a break from studying for his finals
in English.
</P>
<P>
   After he decided to go for it, Grollman explained, he was
assigned to a laboratory at the Sanford I. Weill Medical College of
Cornell University in New York City, and he was in luck. The
laboratory, under the direction of William A. Muller, was engaged
in the study of inflammation in the human body.
</P>
<P>
   Muller and his colleagues had been puzzled by the behavior of a
certain molecule in the inflammation process, but had not had the
time to explore the matter. Consequently, when Grollman showed up
looking for a project, Muller asked him to chase down the
mysterious molecule.
</P>
<P>
   Grollman spent the next year in hot pursuit, finally writing a
paper in which he was able to show that the molecule played a
critical role in helping white blood cells to enter damaged tissue
_ which is a feature of inflammation.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen Randolph, an instructor at the laboratory familiar with
Grollman's work, said his paper made a significant contribution to
understanding the inflammation process, which, when unchecked, can
lead to illnesses from heart disease to arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Grollman and his 39 fellow finalists will travel to Washington
in March for a week of activities, including final judging and the
presentation of awards. The top 10 winners will be announced March
8.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, one of the world's largest makers of computer chips and a
leading manufacturer of computer and communications products,
assumed sponsorship of the 58-year-old contest _ often called the
Junior Nobel Prize _ from the Westinghouse Electric Corp. in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The finalists, who range in age from 14 to 18, were selected
from a group of 300 semifinalists announced earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   New York captured the most finalists with 12, followed by
Maryland with 6 and California with 5.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana and Puerto Rico each have one finalist for the first
time in more than a decade. A student from Berkeley, Calif., is the
second finalist in the program's history to be schooled at home.
</P>
<P>
   A 14-year-old finalist from Colorado is the youngest finalist
since 1978. There are 22 male finalists and 18 female finalists, up
from 10 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring, Md., has the most
finalists with six, the largest number from one school since 1991.
The other high schools with more than one finalist are Great Neck
South High School with three, Bronx High School of Science with
two, and Roslyn High School, also with two. All those schools are
in New York.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Finalists were judged on their research reports for research
ability, scientific originality and creative thinking. Among this
year's finalists, mathematics, physics and biology were the most
popular fields of study, with five projects each.
</P>
<P>
   All Intel Science Talent Search entries were reviewed and judged
by scientists from a variety of disciplines and overseen by J.
Richard Gott, a professor of astrophysical sciences at Princeton
University and a former Science Talent Search finalist in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Finalists will compete for scholarships totaling $330,000, an
increase of $125,000 from 1998. The top prize will be a $50,000
four-year scholarship. The second-prize winner will receive a
$40,000 scholarship, and the third-prize winner will receive a
$30,000 scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth- through sixth-prize winners will receive scholarships of
$20,000 each, while seventh- through 10th-prize winners will each
receive a $15,000 scholarship. The other 30 finalists will each
receive a $3,000 scholarship.

N.Y. GOVERNOR SETS LIMIT FOR HIS PAC OF $50,000 PER DONOR
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George E. Pataki on Monday limited the size
of contributions that he would accept through a political action
committee that he set up to broaden his national standing. Under
the voluntary restriction, the PAC will accept no more than $50,000
from each donor.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said last week that he would create two
fund-raising committees, both called the 21st Century Freedom PAC.
He said he planned to use one to make contributions to federal
candidates; it comes under the strict federal rules.
</P>
<P>
   He established the other committee, for helping state and local
candidates, in Virginia, which has among the most lenient
campaign-finance regulations in the country, including no limits on
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, the state Legislature's top
Democrat, attacked Pataki on Monday for setting up the Virginia
PAC, questioning whether he was trying to get around New York law,
which, while also lax, does have contribution ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Pataki said he would limit the contributions to the
Virginia PAC. His aides said the ceiling would be $50,000 from each
donor. They said the governor had decided to impose the limit
before Silver made his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   While an individual could give $50,000 to a New York PAC,
corporations could not. In New York, corporations are usually
limited to giving a total of $5,000 annually to all state and local
candidates and political action committees.
</P>
<P>
   So even with the voluntary cap, the governor can collect far
larger corporate contributions in Virginia than in New York.
Furthermore, the $50,000 limit will probably not be difficult to
get around. In his races for governor, Pataki found ways to
circumvent New York's limits.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With doors closed to the public and television
cameras switched off, the Senate debated Monday night whether to
dismiss all charges against President Clinton and bring his
impeachment trial to an end.
</P>
<P>
   The debate began after a bid by two Democrats to override the
rules and hold the debate in public view failed to muster the
two-thirds vote required or even a simple majority. The move was
voted down, 43-57, with most Republicans favoring a secret session
and most Democrats an open one.
</P>
<P>
   After four-and-a-half hours of debate, the Senate adjourned a
few moments before 10 p.m. As they left the chamber, none of the
senators was willing to characterize their exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   In the modern era, closed sessions are normally held only when
classified information is discussed. The last one in the Senate was
a debate on the Chemical Weapons Convention on April 24, 1997. But
rules governing impeachment trials date from the mid-19th century,
when senators were not yet directly elected, when the notion of
open government had no great popular appeal and when, of course,
radio and television had not been invented.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to vote on the dismissal motion on
Tuesday or Wednesday, with only a simple majority required for
approval. Few predict that it will pass, but Sen. Robert C. Byrd,
D-W.Va., the sponsor of the measure, and his allies hope to get 40
or more votes, to demonstrate fairly definitively that the
two-thirds vote required for conviction of Clinton is beyond the
reach of the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, the Senate's senior Democrat, submitted the motion Monday
afternoon to bring the trial to an immediate conclusion. There
followed a period of parliamentary confusion and maneuvering that
at one point prompted Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who is
presiding over the trial, to ask an adviser in a stage whisper,
``What do we do now?''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi said he already
had enough votes in hand to defeat Byrd's proposal, and no Democrat
challenged him.
</P>
<P>
   When the procedural knot was finally untied, the Republican
prosecutors and defense lawyers began arguments on dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the Senate for the first time, Nicole K. Seligman,
one of the president's private lawyers, argued that ``the moment
has arrived where the best interests of the nation, the wise
prescription of the framers and the failure of the managers' proof
all point to dismissal.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``The case can not be made. It is time to end it.''
</P>
<P>
   The lead prosecutor, Rep. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill., said in
rebuttal that if the Senate cut off the trial, it would have
``summarily dismissed, disregarded, ignored, brushed off'' charges
of perjury and obstruction of justice that sent ordinary people to
jail almost every day. The motion, he said, was ``a legal way of
saying `So what?' to the charges we've levied.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde betrayed some bitterness at the way the managers' case has
been received by the Senate during the trial. He and his colleagues
had not been treated with much respect, he said, ``because of the
fact that we represent the House, the other body, kind of
blue-collar people, and we're over here trying to survive with our
impeachment articles.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's motion, Hyde declared, ``elevates convenience over
constitutional process.''
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's roll call on opening the debate to the public, the
first vote of the trial, party lines did not hold precisely, which
suggested that perhaps the Senate was not so thoroughly polarized
as had been feared.
</P>
<P>
   The rule change had been proposed by Sens. Tom Harkin of Iowa
and Paul D. Wellstone, both Democrats. Forty Democrats voted to
override the rules, which date from the impeachment trial of
President Andrew Johnson, 131 years ago, and open the debate. They
were joined by three Republicans _ Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania
and Susan Collins of Maine, both moderates, and Kay Bailey
Hutchison of Texas, considered more conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Specter's deputy chief of staff, John Ullyot, later said his
boss felt ``it's only natural that the American people should be at
the deliberations'' on such an issue.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-two Republicans voted to keep the session secret, many of
them because their leadership feared that the Senate's carefully
cultivated image of dignity and bipartisanship would suffer if the
debate were public.
</P>
<P>
   Five Democrats voted to keep the deliberations closed, including
Blanche L. Lincoln of Arkansas, just beginning her first term; Max
Baucus of Montana, Paul S. Sarbanes of Maryland and both of
Virginia's senators, Byrd and John D. Rockefeller IV.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that we be able to let our hair down,'' Byrd
declared afterward. ``We will say things in a closed session that
are really what we're thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that open sessions would have invited ``grandstanding
and party wrangling,'' Baucus said that ``when it comes to the
final Senate deliberations in this trial, I believe the best course
for senators, like jurors and judges, to deliberate privately and
avoid partisanship.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the roll call had ended, Rehnquist called out from
the dais, ``The sergeant at arms will please close the doors.''
</P>
<P>
   One element in the parliamentary maneuvering that began the day
gave a small clue to the future. Sens. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., and
Ms. Collins, the Maine Republican, moved unsuccessfully to split
Byrd's motion in two, so that they could vote separately on whether
to dismiss the impeachment article dealing with perjury or the one
covering obstruction of justice. Both, it was reported, want to
carry the obstruction article forward so they can hear testimony
from the president's secretary, Betty Currie, a key figure in
several of the incidents cited as examples of the alleged
obstruction.
</P>
<P>
   The effort failed, but it suggested that Feingold might vote
against Byrd's motion, which is favored by almost all the Senate
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In the summing-up that preceded the closing of the doors, for
which each side was allotted an hour, Rep. Charles T. Canady,
R-Fla., led off for the prosecutors. He urged the Senate to
remember that never in the 200-year history of the Constitution had
there been a decision to dismiss a proceeding against any official,
whether president or judge, ``who remained in office after
impeachment by the House of Representatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Canady revisited a number of the constitutional arguments made
by the prosecutors over the last two weeks, but he added a new one.
Defense lawyers have argued that while judges might be removed for
perjury or such crimes, convicting a president required a higher
standard because it involved overturning an election.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Seligman so argued Monday, asserting that ``any question,
any doubt, must be resolved in favor of the electoral will.'' She
argued that ``the doubt here is pervasive,'' and that ``doubt upon
doubt upon doubt makes a vote to dismiss the only fair choice.''
</P>
<P>
   But Canady noted that in 1995 the Senate had been on the point
of dismissing one of its members, Sen. Bob Packwood, D-Ore., also
an elected official, when he resigned. His offenses, the Floridian
said, were similar to those charged against Clinton, as described
by the Ethics Committee: illegal acts that ``constitute a violation
of his policy of trust to the Senate and an abuse of his position
as a United States Senator.''
</P>
<P>
   Packwood was accused of sexually harassing women and then
attempting to cover it up.

OLOWOKONDI BACK FOR CLIPPERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM DESERT, Calif. _ The special provision in Michael
Olowokandi's first pro basketball contract has been upgraded from
escape clause to Santa Claus.
</P>
<P>
   The recipients of this gift are the Clippers, who are eager to
have their present accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked out as well as it could have,'' said Elgin Baylor,
the team's vice president of basketball operations, in a
declaration he doesn't get to make that often.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Olowokandi _ the Clippers' and the NBA's top pick in
the 1998 draft _ was released from his contract by Kinder, a
Bologna-based Italian League team that negotiated a settlement over
the remainder of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   This will allow Olowokandi to join the Clippers, who were
waiting for the 7-foot-1 rookie's original Feb. 15 escape clause to
kick in. Olowokandi, whose last game in Italy was compromised by
tendinitis in his right knee, is expected to arrive in Los Angeles
on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   His agent, Bill Duffy, was in Dallas and could not be reached
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi has to sign a Clippers contract and pass a physical
exam before he can join the team on the practice floor.
</P>
<P>
   Kinder signed Olowokandi, who went from raw prospect to star in
three seasons at the University of Pacific, to a three-month
contract just one day before the NBA owners and players' union
reached a deal that ended a six-month lockout. The escape clause
was a hedge included by Duffy, in the event an NBA season could be
spared.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the lockout, the Clippers had been hoping Duffy
could liberate their franchise cornerstone a week to 10 days early.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's random act of Kinder was partly inspired by
Olowokandi's modest contribution of 7.7 points and 5.8 rebounds in
six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten a few pro games under my belt and I'm in great
shape,'' Olowokandi said. ``I look forward to the challenge I'll
face in the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinder's interest in saving some loot also accelerated
Olowokandi's early pardon. Olowokandi would have been paid $1.8
million for staying in Italy for three months, and $600,000 for
remaining until Feb. 15.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of missing at least six NBA games, he should be in a
Clippers uniform for the Feb. 5 opener against Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sooner, the better . . . for Michael and for us,'' new
Clippers coach Chris Ford said after Monday morning's training-camp
workout at the College of the Desert. ``We'll spoon-feed him. He's
got a lot of catching up to do, but this should make us a better
team.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Kinder's plan as well. But according to Clippers spin,
Olowokandi's slow start in Italy can be explained by the European
style of play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, centers don't get very involved in the offense over
there,'' Baylor said. ``It's very guard-oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant coach Jim Brewer, who also did a tour of pro-hoop duty
in Italy, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very much different from what you would see over here,''
Brewer said. ``(Michael) was thrown right into the fire, and that's
not what he needs.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ford's opinion, what the 23-year-old Olowokandi needs is
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just let it evolve,'' Ford said. ``Let's not put any
pressure on the guy. We'll judge him on what he does for us.''

SPLIT DECISION SETS STAGE FOR BATTLES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (With SCOTUS-CENSUS) 
(ATTN: Calif., Ill.)  (nk)

   WASHINGTON _ Far from putting the issue of census sampling to
rest, Monday's Supreme Court decision is virtually certain to lead
to fierce battles in Congress, state legislatures and courts
nationwide over what census figures should be used to draw district
lines and to distribute federal money, elected officials and census
experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The court said in its 5-4 ruling Monday that the Clinton
administration could not use sampling, a scientific polling
technique, to adjust the 2000 census to apportion seats in the
House of Representatives among the 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   But the court left the door open for states to use adjusted
census data when they draw new lines for congressional, legislative
and other political seats in 2000 and after. And the ruling seemed
to suggest that the federal government ought to use adjusted
figures in giving aid to states and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's split decision will almost certainly set up highly
charged, partisan conflicts in the coming months, census experts
said. That is because sampling tends to increase the count of
Democratic-leaning groups that have traditionally been
undercounted: city dwellers, racial and ethnic minorities and
immigrants. Republicans contend that sampling can be manipulated
for political purposes and that only straight head counts should be
used.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said that as a result of Monday's ruling, the
administration is likely to call for producing two sets of census
numbers in 2000: one a straight headcount, the other a figure
adjusted through sampling. Republicans are expected to try to block
money for the adjusted count.
</P>
<P>
   State legislatures, which in most states will set the rules for
redistricting, are also expected to take up the issue of which set
of census figures to use in drawing lines: the traditional
enumeration or the adjusted count.
</P>
<P>
   In states with large cities, like New York, the differences
between those two sets of figures would considerably affect the way
districts are drawn. Some demographers have projected that sampling
could increase New York City's population by 250,000 or more. That
means the city might not lose any of its congressional seats and
might gain seats in the state Legislature, while surrounding
suburban areas like Suffolk and Nassau Counties might lose seats in
both Congress and the Legislature. (New York is projected to lose
two congressional seats in 2000.)
</P>
<P>
   States like California and Illinois would probably see similar
shifts with sampling.
</P>
<P>
   Lorna B. Goodman, a spokeswoman for New York City's corporation
counsel, said using sampling for redistricting ``would certainly
make sense for the city.'' But Ms. Goodman would not comment on
whether Mayor Rudolph Giuliani would push the Legislature to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki declined through a spokesman to comment.

GRAND JURY SAID TO WEIGH CHARGES AGAINST FATHER IN BOYS' DEATHS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Queens man who is under investigation in the
killings of his two young sons disappeared with them on Jan. 9
after a violent domestic quarrel in which he struck his wife and
she threatened to take their children back to her native Poland,
law enforcement officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Ronald Short, 49, remained in custody Monday on $10
million bail on minor charges related to the disappearance of the
boys. A grand jury is to begin hearing evidence in Manhattan
Tuesday to consider charges of murder against Short, said police
officials and a civilian witness who has been subpoenaed to testify
before the jury. Barbara Thompson, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan
district attorney's office, would not confirm that the grand jury
would begin meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Short was last seen with the boys on Jan. 9, and his wife,
Jolanta, reported the children missing on Jan. 13. Short was
arrested on Jan. 15 on charges that he had endangered their welfare
by keeping them out of school. He was released the next day when
his wife and nephew posted $10,000 in bail, and was arrested again
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   From the first, law enforcement officials said, he told them
that the children were ``in a safe place'' but refused to say
where. The boys' bodies were found Saturday in the basement of a
building at 36 W. 25th St. that Short managed, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard, 7, had been hacked to death, an autopsy found, and his
brother, John, 3, had been beaten in the head. Spattered blood
found near the spot where the bodies were found has led police to
decide that the children were killed there, said a police official
who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

NETS COULD FIND SPOT FOR 5-FOOT-5 BOYKINS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Mich., Ohio)  (mk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ If everything works out for Earl
Boykins, he will initially be viewed as a curiosity. He will be the
new Spud Webb, the heir apparent to Muggsy Bogues, the Mutt to
7-foot-7-inch Gheorghe Muresan's Jeff.
</P>
<P>
   When you're 5-5 and playing in the National Basketball
Association, that's the way it is. But if Boykins, one of five
free-agent hopefuls trying out for the Nets this week, earns an NBA
roster spot, it will not be long before people start noticing his
skills instead of his size.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets learned as much during the first few days of training
camp, when Boykins sped by their players like a Manhattan taxi to
lead fast breaks and hit midrange jump shots against coach John
Calipari's first team. The rookie out of Eastern Michigan has been
so impressive that many of the Nets have come to believe he
deserves to be in uniform when they open their season at Atlanta on
Feb. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was my decision, I'd have him on the team,'' said Sam
Cassell, whose opinion was seconded by a fellow starter, Kendall
Gill. ``He's small, but he's polished. He's fast, plus he can hit
the open jumper. Now that we've got a big guy like Jim McIlvaine, I
can see Earl Boykins making this ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his all-America credentials, Boykins entered camp as a
long shot. But after five days of watching him pester Cassell and
the backup Eric Murdock, Calipari said Boykins would most likely be
one of the 14 players the Nets keep for at least the first two
weeks of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like him so much that I'll probably keep him here as long as
I can,'' Calipari said. ``He's really doing well. He's
unbelievable. You wish he was bigger, but he is who he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Boykins burst onto the national scene by scoring 23 points as
Eastern Michigan upset Duke in the first round of the 1995 NCAA
tournament. For the next two years, NBA scouts swarmed to Eastern
Michigan games to watch Boykins showcase the scoring ability he
developed while playing on his father's adult recreational league
team in Cleveland as a 12-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   With the quickness to keep defenders off balance, the uncanny
knack to shoot over the tallest opponents and a steady jump shot,
Boykins averaged 25.7 points, second-best in the nation, as a
senior. The previous summer, he had sparkled on the international
stage, posting a team-best average of 15.7 points to lead the
United States to the gold medal at the World University Games in
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been blessed with a tremendous gift from God,'' said
Boykins, who wore football pads underneath his shorts in college to
protect himself from getting kneed. ``I've never had trouble
scoring over taller people. It's hard to explain.''
</P>
<P>
   When Boykins left Eastern Michigan last spring with a degree in
communications and career averages of 18.1 points and 5.1 assists,
NBA draft analysts predicted he would be selected late in the first
round or early in the second. On draft night, however, Boykins'
name was never called.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was down for about two days,'' said Boykins, who left a
24-game stint in the Continental Basketball Association to attend
the Nets' camp. ``Then I just put it behind me because people have
doubted me before. They said I couldn't play Division I basketball.
So I just have to go out and prove myself again. I have no doubt I
can play at this level.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Embry, general manager of the Cleveland Cavaliers, said he
had major interest in Boykins but decided against selecting him
because the Cavs had an undersized point guard in 5-9 Brevin
Knight. As it turned out, the Cavs joined Washington, Minnesota,
Orlando and the Nets in inviting Boykins to camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he can play in this league,'' Embry said. ``He's the
type of guy you just put on your team and don't worry about how he
matches up. When you need to change the tempo of the game to mess
up the other team, just put him in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the inevitable comparisons to the 5-6 Webb and the 5-3
Bogues are justified, Boykins is different from both players. While
neither Webb nor Bogues has much of a jump shot, Boykins is deadly
out to 20 feet, and Cassell said Boykins reads the floor and runs
an offense as well as his predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Physically, though, Boykins is behind Webb and Bogues. Webb, of
course, had the outstanding leaping ability that enabled him to win
the slam-dunk competition before the 1986 all-star game, and
Bogues, a 12th-year veteran playing in Golden State, has a
bodybuilder's physique that allows him to push around taller
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Boykins, however, is slightly built and weighs only 145 pounds.
And though strong _ he bench-presses 270 pounds _ he is sure to get
posted up by his competitors. He will not be a total liability
defensively, though, because his superior quickness allows him to
disrupt ballhandlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so small that when he's on the court, you have to locate
him every time because if you don't, the ball will definitely be
gone,'' Cassell said. ``When I'm dribbling, I make sure I'm paying
attention to Earl, not my dribble.''
</P>
<P>
   Boykins hopes to have thousands of NBA fans paying attention to
him over the next four months, but not because of his stature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people to think of me as a great basketball player,''
Boykins said. ``My dream is not just to be one of the greatest
small guys, but one of the greatest point guards to ever play this
game.''

WHITMAN BUDGET MESSAGE FOCUSES ON PROPERTY-TAX RELIEF 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JENNIFER PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Gov. Christie Whitman presented lawmakers Monday
with a proposed budget that would return $200 million to property
taxpayers, but she made it clear that any cuts in property tax
rates would require tough choices by municipal officials and
taxpayers about their local services.
</P>
<P>
   In her annual budget address to the Legislature, Whitman called
upon taxpayers to demand that local officials eliminate unnecessary
layers of government and share more municipal and school services
with neighboring cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real reform is going to require really tough choices at the
local level,'' she said. ``Our citizens should be asking why New
Jersey _ the most densely populated state in the country _ spends
more than any other state to bus a child to school. Citizens should
ask, does New Jersey really need 1,600 separate units of local
government?''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman made property taxes the theme of her speech, outlining
her proposed $19.16 billion spending plan for the coming fiscal
year, which starts July 1.
</P>
<P>
   With the state's coffers overflowing with surging tax revenues
from the strong economy and a windfall from the nationwide tobacco
settlement, Whitman has $1.1 billion more to spend in the new
fiscal year than she had a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $200 million in property tax rebates, the
first installment of her five-year property tax relief program, her
budget also includes $23 million for a program that would freeze
property taxes for low-income elderly and disabled homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   She also included $22 million to cover the cost of removing
about 200,000 low-income residents from the state income tax rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's plan would increase spending for public schools,
higher education and open space preservation and for health care
programs for children and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she proposes using a third of the $93 million the
state expects to receive from the tobacco settlement to cover costs
of health care benefit for state employees. Other funds from the
tobacco settlement would be earmarked for anti-smoking programs
aimed at teen-agers and for other health-related programs.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers, who control both the Assembly and the
Senate and whose support Whitman needs for her budget, had nothing
but praise for the spending plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a Christmas budget,'' said the Assembly speaker, Jack
Collins, a Republican from Salem County, as he pointed to a
Christmas necktie that he wore for the occasion. ``Everyone should
be happy with it. I think that it touched on every segment of our
society: education, crime, the elderly and tax relief. I think it
should be getting bipartisan support.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats, while careful not to criticize Whitman's plan to
send property tax rebate checks to homeowners, said that they
thought the budget proposal should have done more to bring down
property tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Jersey residents will still be the most highly burdened
taxpayers in the country,'' said the Assembly's Democratic leader,
Joseph Doria, of Hudson County.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office six years ago, Whitman has insisted that
local officials, not the governor and state Legislature, determine
local property tax rates. And to encourage local governments to
consolidate services, Whitman said that she had also included $35
million in her proposed budget for incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to start handing out aid as a reward for doing the
right thing to promote government reform,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   By trying to move the debate over property taxes from the State
House to the local level, Whitman was fending off one of the
sharpest attacks of the property tax relief program that she
announced earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that her proposal, while giving homeowners rebates,
would do little to address the state's long-term property tax
problem because it would not reduce or hold down rate increases.
The state has the highest property tax rates in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   One of the major reasons is the numerous levels of local
government. With its long tradition of home rule, New Jersey has
566 cities and towns. In addition, taxpayers help finance 21
counties, 188 fire districts and 611 school districts.
</P>
<P>
   But some Democrats and local school officials say that Whitman
is not addressing a major cause of the state's property tax burden:
state assistance for public schools. They say New Jersey's state
revenue covers about 40 percent of the costs of local school
districts, with property taxes making up the balance.
</P>
<P>
   The national average for state assistance is 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Jersey over-relies on property taxes to fund schools,''
said Charles Reilly, president of the New Jersey School Boards
Association. ``Tax reform requires a permanent rebalancing of state
and local revenue sources used to support schools.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Richard Codey, the Democratic leader in the Senate,
said Whitman's words and her budget failed to address the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we have the highest rates will not change one
iota,'' Codey said. ``We're still No. 1, and that's just wrong.
Unless you radically change the way you fund education, we're
always going to be No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also criticized Whitman for not putting up the money
now to pay for her property tax rebate program, which will cost the
state $1 billion a year by 2004, two years after she leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   At a cost of $200 million to the state budget this year, rebate
checks, which will average about $120, would go out to homeowners
some time after Labor Day. When the program is fully phased in, the
checks are to rise to about $600 a year.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, Richard Marino, an analyst at Standard &AMP; Poor's,
said the governor's overall budget was prudent, but that the
property tax plan left important questions unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   ``How will it be paid for?'' Marino asked. ``Does it really
address the underlying problems of the state: schools and
duplication of services? While it might provide relief for
taxpayers, the underlying problems are still there.''

GEORGIA'S NEW GOVERNOR PROPOSES A REMEDY FOR ATLANTA'S SPRAWL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Following through on a campaign pledge to combat
suburban sprawl, Georgia's new governor, Roy E. Barnes, proposed
Monday to create a powerful new regional transportation authority
in metropolitan Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The new agency, if approved by the General Assembly, would have
the authority to impose plans for mass transit and new highways
without the approval of local governments and the state Department
of Transportation, Barnes said. Its first task might be to oversee
the planning, financing and construction of an ambitious light rail
line across the arc of Atlanta's rapidly developing northern
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, a Democrat and former legislator, took office two weeks
ago pledging to address the interrelated problems of traffic
congestion, air pollution and unchecked land development that have
become byproducts of the Atlanta area's remarkable growth. Those
issues, which were largely ignored by Barnes' predecessor, Zell
Miller, played a significant role in the Barnes campaign last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a choice,'' said Barnes, a native son of the
Atlanta suburbs, at a news conference Monday. ``We either address
this problem or this boom area that we have talked about so much,
this Atlanta region that has fed the jobs and fed the tax coffers
of this state so that we could improve education, so that we could
help the university system, so that we could incarcerate criminals,
all of those sources of revenues will suffer unless we send a clear
signal that we're ready to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last year, the 13-county Atlanta region has been
ineligible for federal highway funds for new road projects because
it has failed to devise a plan that would bring it into compliance
with the Federal Clean Air Act. The Atlanta area, which has doubled
its population to 3.1 million in the last 30 years, is one of the
nation's worst violators of federal standards for ground-level
ozone, with most of the problem caused by motor-vehicle emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the problem with transportation planning in metropolitan
Atlanta has been caused by the inability of dozens of local
governments, each with its own views on growth, mass transit and
taxation, to agree on a regional plan. A group that was intended to
promote regional solutions, the Atlanta Regional Commission, has
been reduced to little more than a forum for research and
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Under Barnes' proposal, a new Georgia Regional Transportation
Authority, with 15 members appointed by the governor, would have
broad power to step in and impose a variety of transportation plans
if the Atlanta Regional Commission, the state Department of
Transportation and local governments failed to devise consensus
plans on their own. If, for instance, those groups cannot agree on
the construction of a rail line in the northern suburbs, the
authority can plan the line, sell bonds, secure federal financing,
build the project and even operate the trains, Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   The authority would also be required to approve road-building
plans by local governments and the state Department of
Transportation if they would have a significant impact on traffic
patterns and pollution. Barnes said the authority should provide
``an incentive to cooperate'' because of the threat that local
governments would lose control of their own transportation
planning.
