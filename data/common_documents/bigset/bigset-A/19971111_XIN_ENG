<HEADLINE> HKSAR Chief Reiterates Determination to Defend Currency Peg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tung Chee Hwa reiterated
his determination tonight to defend the Hong Kong-U.S. currency
linked exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 1997 Annual Fellowship Dinner of the Hong Kong
Management Association, Tung said: "Let me first emphasize that
the linked exchange rate between the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S.
dollar is here to stay."
</P>
<P>
"This policy will not, and I repeat, will not change," he
stressed. "We are fully committed to the linked exchange rate, not
just for political reasons, but on good economic grounds. For 14
years, the link has provided the economic stability and
contributed to the maintenance of confidence in Hong Kong's role
as an international trading and financial center."
</P>
<P>
He said that any fundamental changes in policy would cause
grave uncertainty and disturbance which could weaken investment
sentiments.
</P>
<P>
He underlined three facts supporting his determination: the
SAR's economic fundamentals are strong; the success of Hong Kong's
economy has been built upon free and open market forces; and the
SAR government is acutely aware of the need to sustain and enhance
Hong Kong's competitiveness and that these efforts will contribute
to a speedier recovery.
</P>
<P>
In defending the linked exchange rate, Tung said, interest
rates had gone up. "Indeed, continued uncertainty surrounding the
linked exchange rate as well as the currency turmoil in other
parts of Asia tend to keep interest rates high."
</P>
<P>
"But," he continued, "presently we have no other alternatives."
"I myself and my colleagues in the (SAR) government are acutely
aware of the pain caused to many sectors of the community as a
result of the high interest rate."
</P>
<P>
He stressed: "For the immediate future, it is possible that the
interest rate may even increase but I hope this is only a
short-term phenomenon."
</P>
<P>
The Chief Executive said the bright outlook of the SAR's
economy is based on the following:
</P>
<P>
-- The level of the SAR's housing cost is already coming down
which should greatly improve the SAR's overall competitiveness;
</P>
<P>
-- The motherland's economy will continue to do well as moving
into the 21st century and the SAR is uniquely positioned to
benefit from this development;
</P>
<P>
-- When compared with other Asian markets, the SAR's highly
liquid, well regulated and transparent stock market will be the
first to attract foreign investment back once the dust settles
down;
</P>
<P>
-- The SAR's high foreign exchange reserve and fiscal reserve
will provide an anchor for its future economic development.
</P>
<P>
Tung expressed his firm confidence in Hong Kong's future,
noting: "In deed, of all the countries and communities that have
been affected by the financial turmoil, I know ours will be the
first to rebound."

<HEADLINE> Canadians Want to Improve Social Safety Net </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A majority of Canadians want
the government to improve a social safety net stretched by cuts,
high poverty and unemployment, a new poll suggested.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-two percent of those surveyed said that the government
should take measures to tackle child poverty, unemployment and
declining health care before tax cuts or paying down the national
debt.
</P>
<P>
The poll of 1,572 Canadians were conducted late last month by
Ottawa-based Ekos Research Associates, with a margin of error of
plus or minus 2.6 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The poll results differ from a similar poll in February 1994,
shortly after the Chretien government was first elected.
</P>
<P>
At that time, debt and deficit reduction was Canadians' top
priority and there was a high demand for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
Yet, while concern over the debt and deficit has abated,
Canadians appeared deeply concerned about lowering the 590 billion
dollar (420 billion US dollar) national debt, the new poll found.

<HEADLINE> Future Use of HK Government House to Be Decided Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The office of the Chief
Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
said tonight that a final decision on the future use of the
Government House is expected to be made in the first quarter of
1998.
</P>
<P>
In response to press enquiries, the office said in a statement
that Chief Executive of the SAR Tung Chee Hwa "had decided to make
the Government House, a building of significant historical value,
more accessible to the public after the handover" on July 1 this
year.
</P>
<P>
"The Chief Executive has decided to continue living in
Grenville House and not in the Government House as he feels that
it would be a more appropriate way to mark the beginning of a new
era after the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR," the office
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the office, Tung has asked the SAR government to
prepare a proposal on the long-term use of the Government House,
including the feasibility of converting part of the Government
House into a museum.
</P>
<P>
The government is presently examining various options regarding
the long-term use of the Government house, the office said, adding
that it is expected that a final decision on the matter will be
made in the first quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Perched amid an oasis of green behind the bustling Central
District, Hong Kong island, the Government House is an odd mixture
of architectural features and is the oldest surviving official
residence used by former British Hong Kong Governors. Its
construction began in 1851 and ended in 1855.
</P>
<P>
The Government House is now being used by the Chief Executive
and his wife for official functions, the statement said. The Chief
Executive also welcomes applications by government bureaux and
departments, charitable organizations and other public
organizations to host major events which promote public interests,
it added.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Convenes Conference on Hate Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Faced with increased hate
crimes in the country, U.S. President Bill Clinton is gathering
law enforcement officials and others to consider how to deal with
the problem.
</P>
<P>
The conference, involving about 350 people, is an offshoot of
the president's race relations initiative.
</P>
<P>
Besides law enforcement, the participants in today's White
House conference were to include civil rights activists,
educators, religious leaders and victims of hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
According to Justice Department statistics, 8,759 hate crimes
were reported in 1996, compared with 7,947 reported in the
previous year. White House officials said they are not sure
whether the increase indicates that hate crimes are up or that
they are reported better.
</P>
<P>
Race was a factor in 63 percent of all reported hate crimes,
followed by religion, 13.9 percent; sexual orientation, 12
percent; and ethnic origin, 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
The efforts Clinton was expected to announce today are designed
to ensure that current laws are working and are leading to
arrests, said Elena Kagan, deputy assistant to the president for
domestic policy.
</P>
<P>
She said hate crimes "tend to be serious and often violent."
</P>
<P>
In an interview on NBC's "Meet the Press" aired Sunday, Clinton
said, "The real problem in America is still continuing
discrimination and fear and downright misunderstanding."

WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Pentagon officials said
today that a U.S. U-2 spy plane flew over central Iraq on orders
from the United Nations earlier this morning without incident.
</P>
<P>
The officials said other U.S. jets watched protectively from
no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq but did not escort the
high-flying U-2 over central Iraq. The Iraqis did not try to shoot
down the spy plane as previously threatened, they said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was reported to say that a spy plane had crossed its
border from Saudi Arabia but was out of range of anti-aircraft
missiles.

<HEADLINE> Lee Hoi-chang's Ratings Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 10 (Xinhua) -- With the presidential election
38 days away, presidential candidate Lee Hoi-chang of the largest
New Korea Party (NKP) experienced a jump in his popularity ratings
in the latest opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
But his improvement fell short to affecting the ongoing
triangular presidential race in which opposition leader Kim
Dae-jung remains in the lead and former Kyonggi governor Rhee
In-je keeps the second place.
</P>
<P>
The latest polls, launched by major dailies over the weekend,
showed that Lee has regained over 20 percent support, though still
trailed behind Kim with 30s percent and Rhee with 20 plus percent.
</P>
<P>
Lee once topped public approval ratings among the candidates
when he was elected the NKP's candidate in July.
</P>
<P>
But his popularity nosedived to less than 20 percent after
allegations that his two sons evaded military service.
</P>
<P>
The polls were the first to be published after the presidential
race became a three-way competition between Kim, Rhee and Lee.
</P>
<P>
Cho Soon, a former Seoul mayor, has given up his presidential
bid after agreeing to merge his small opposition Democratic Party
with Lee's NKP last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Pollsters attributed Lee's upsurge in popularity to the
agreement on the merger and NKP officials projected Lee's
popularity will further improve.
</P>
<P>
The decrease in Rhee's popularity came after his rivals accused
President Kim Young-sam of supporting his bid.
</P>
<P>
Rhee's rivals suspect that the president might be backing Rhee,
his former close associate, citing the fact that Rhee's party is
mainly composed of Kim's followers.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the main opposition National Congress for New
Politics led by Kim Dae-jung said its Kim will benefit the most
from the fierce competition between Rhee and Lee.

<HEADLINE> UN Seeks 17.7 Mln Dlr Emergency Aid to Republic of Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations today
launched the Consolidated Inter-Agency Flash Appeal for the
Republic of Congo, requesting 17.7 million US dollars to meet the
priority needs of 650,000 internally-displaced people for an
initial period of three months.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued here today by the UN
Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA), the infrastructure in
the Republic of Congo is in ruins and casualties are estimated at
well over 5,000 and there have been massive displacements of urban
populations to rural areas following five months of armed
conflict.
</P>
<P>
The capital city of Brazzaville was emptied of practically all
of its population, who sought refuge in the southern districts, in
Pointe-Noire, as well as in villages in the north and south of the
country, the DHA said.
</P>
<P>
The UN appeal will address the needs of families who have been
displaced as well as those residing in the capital. The priority
will be given to the provision of food and nutrition, shelter,
basic health care, water and sanitation as well as limited
distribution of seeds and tools to assist internally displaced
persons and host families to restore and improve food security
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Particular attention will be given to single-parent families,
female-headed households, unaccompanied children and those
traumatized by the armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
The international community is calling upon donors to respond
generously and without delay to this appeal which should
facilitate the return of the displaced to their communities of
origin, the DHA said.

PARIS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
will try to promote economic cooperation with Vietnam during his
five-day visit to the country starting Wednesday, French
presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said today.
</P>
<P>
As part of his Vietnam tour, Chirac will sign a new package
providing 350 million francs (58 million U.S. dollars) in loans to
Vietnam annually.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said the visit would allow France to "reaffirm
its presence and anchor" in Asian markets, following Chirac's
promise to triple his country's presence there in 10 years. He
made the promise during his visit to Singapore in February 1996.
</P>

After winding up his stay in Vietnam, the French president is
scheduled to visit Malaysia on Sunday and Monday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Satisfied With U-2 Safe Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton was
satisfied with the flight of a U-2 spy plane over Central Iraq
this morning without incident, the White House said today.
</P>
<P>
"The president is satisfied that the mission went forward,"
White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters.
</P>
<P>
According to Pentagon officials, the U-2 was watched carefully
by other U.S. jets from "no-fly" zones in northern and southern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqis were said to have found the spy plane crossed its
border from Saudi Arabia, but did not try to shoot as they had
previously warned. They said the spy plane was out of range of
anti-aircraft missiles.
</P>
<P>
The U-2 spy planes resumed their flights today on orders from
the United Nations after more than one week's delay because of
talks between U.N. envoys and Iraqi officials over a dispute, in
which the Iraqis refused Americans in U.N. arms inspection teams
to enter their country.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said President Clinton now wanted the U.N. Security
Council to issue an "unambiguous and strong statement" on resuming
weapons inspections, which also were suspended for a week.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council is to meet today to discuss the
situation in Iraq.

LUANDA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Parliamentarian members from
various parties expressed their wishes for a final peace in the
country here today, to mark the 22nd anniversary of its
independence which falls on tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Jose Maria, parliamentary member from the ruling People's
Movement for the Liberation of Angola said that on the eve of the
22nd anniversary of Angola's Independence Day, all parties should
unite for the lofty ideal of sustained peace in the country.
</P>

Maria said that if all parties give up the divergences and
become true compatriots, "it would not be difficult for a true
peace to materialize."
</P>
<P>
Bensamim Da Silva, a parliamentary member from the National
Liberation Front of Angola said that the Independence Day
celebration might be more colorful had a peace and national
reconciliation be realized in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that national interest is higher than that of any
party, and the parties should change their views to concentrate
the country's effort on rebuilding the country which is heavily
undermined by war.
</P>
<P>
Paulo Rangel, another PM from the ruling People's Movement for
the Liberation of Angola said that peace process, the
corner-stone for the future of the country, must be carried out
to the end with full effort.
</P>

Angola) to observe the 1994 Lusaka Peace Accord for the final
peace to come earlier in the country.

HARARE, November 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 400,000 Zimbabwean
people whose food stocks have dwindled will need food aid this
year under the government's drought relief program.
</P>
<P>
The National Early Warning Unit said today in its latest food
security bulletin that excessive rains experienced last season
resulted in waterlogging and leaching of soil nutrients in some
parts of the country. As a result, more people could actually be
in need of relief to avert a looming food crisis.
</P>
<P>
The food security bulletin has warned the Grain Marketing
Board (GMB) to shelve exporting maize until it has a clearer
picture of the coming season, given the current warnings of the
El Nino effects.
</P>
<P>
The stocks of maize with the GMB by October 3 this year were
548,934 tons. The present stocks were, however, above the
strategic grain reserve of 500,000 tons by 48,934 tons.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A five-day African regional
meeting of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) started
here today.
</P>
<P>
The objective of this meeting, which is held every two years,
is to review the implementation of International Conference on
Population and Development (ICPD)'s program of action in terms of
achievements, constraints and lessons learned.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also review recent developments in particular
the ongoing UN reforms and their implications on UNFPA work and
operations.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, UN Population Fund Director Virginia
Ofusu-Umaar told the delegates that most African countries have
experienced significant falls in birth rates and infant mortality
in the last two years following the implementation of population
management programs.
</P>
<P>
She said success was due to increased trained family planning
and reproductive health personnel.
</P>
<P>
She said fertility had fallen by a third in Zimbabwe, while
Kenya had experienced a fall from eight children in the 1970s to
5.5 children.
</P>
<P>
However, there was still a high rate of unwanted pregnancies
and abortions. Nearly 22,000 African women, most of them
adolescents, died annually from unsafe abortion practices.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's National Economic Planning Commissioner Richard
Hove said UNFPA had made a great contribution to the success
Zimbabwe had enjoyed in family planning and other population
related activities.

<P>
LONDON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
signaled support for further tightening of the newspaper
industry's code of conduct which was agreed by editors following
the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, said local press reports
today.
</P>
<P>
Culture and Media Secretary Chris Smith was quoted as saying
that despite the voluntary strengthening of the code of conduct by
the industry in the wake of Diana's death in August, there was
still room for improvement.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his commitment to the principle of
self-regulation and emphasized his distaste for privacy
legislation.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that newspapers could agree among themselves to
dispatch just one photographer and reporter on sensitive
assignments, and to share any resulting story or picture.
</P>
<P>
Smith said that in order to spare victims of crime the distress
of being bombarded by media attention, the industry's code of
conduct should include formal arrangements for newspapers to
interview them on a pooled basis.
</P>
<P>
He added that although the question of compensation for victims
of media harassment was complex, the Press Complaints Commission
should include it in its discussions on how to further improve its
code of conduct.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Dissolves 7th Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi today dissolved the 7th Parliament to pave the way for the
coming General Election in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement issued here today, Moi said that the
dissolution was in exercise of the powers conferred upon him by
the Kenya Constitution.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the program for the General Election to
elect members of the 8th Parliament would be announced in
accordance with Kenya's laws.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Minister for Local Government has also
dissolved all the councils under the Local Government Act.
</P>
<P>
Under the Kenya Constitution, the country's Electoral
Commission is in charge of setting the timetable for nominations
and campaigning.
</P>
<P>
In Kenya's ballot system, there is a gap of five to six weeks
between the dissolution of parliament and the announcement of
polling date while Kenyan law gives at least 21 days for
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
As Kenya's president must also be a MP, there must be a
parliamentary election to go along with a presidential poll.
</P>
<P>
With Moi's term ending on January 4 next year, the
presidential and parliamentary elections are likely to be held in
mid-December this year, most observers here predicted.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Moi, 74 and in power since 1978, launched an
election manifesto of the ruling Kenya African National Union
(KANU) and has already been formally nominated by his party as
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
Most political analysts view Moi as favorite in the General
Election as opposition parties in the east African country are so
divided that they had failed to agree on a single presidential
candidate.

<P>
(By Liu Yegang, Zhao Yi)
</P>
<P>
PRETORIA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and China today
agreed to further expand trade and economic cooperation in a
meeting between South African Trade and Industry Minister Alec
Erwin and a Chinese delegation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese trade and economic delegation, led by Shi
Guangsheng, deputy minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation, is the largest ever Chinese mission to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Erwin said South Africa, which enjoys rich natural resources
and good infrastructure, attaches importance to developing trade
relations with China, Southeast Asia and Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said he is looking forward to visiting China next year to
explore trade opportunities after normalization of bilateral
relations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
South Africa supports China in its bid for the membership of
the World Trade Organization (WTO), he said, adding that without
China, the WTO would not be complete.
</P>
<P>
He said his country, which faces financial problems, would
encourage foreign trade to help with the economic development.
</P>
<P>
Shi said the two economies are highly complementary and the
two countries could cooperate in various fields in diverse
manners.
</P>
<P>
After the establishment of diplomatic relations between the
two countries, an inter-governmental trade agreement and an
agreement on investment protection are to be signed, Shi said.
</P>
<P>
He said the agreements will provide a sound foundation for
further development of bilateral trade and economic relations.

<HEADLINE> Alatas: Cambodian Politicians' Safety Can Be Guaranteed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 10 (xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister
Ali Alatas said here today that Cambodia's pro-Ranariddh
politicians could go home without having to worry about
intimidation or court threats.
</P>
<P>
The minister considered their return to Cambodia very important
in creating a conducive atmosphere for the implementation of a
fair and just general elections in Cambodia scheduled for May next
year.
</P>
<P>
"Thus the ASEAN troika consisting of the foreign ministers of
Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines will keep on trying to
facilitate the return of these Cambodian politicians to enable
them to prepare for the general elections," he said.
</P>
<P>
A number of Cambodian politicians particularly the supporters
of Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who fled abroad after Ranariddh was
ousted by Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, are afraid of their
safety for returning.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said Ranariddh's return remains a problem as Hun Sen
threatened to take him to court for alledged illegal importing
weapons.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), which groups
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Laos, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, suspended the scheduled admission
of Cambodia after its recent political crisis.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Party Congress to Pick Top Leaders Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DODOMA (Tanzania), November 10 (Xinhua) -- The fifth national
congress of Tanzania's ruling party CCM, which will pick its top
leaders for the next five years, opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,500 delegates to the congress will elect the party's
national chairman and his two deputies -- one from the Mainland
and another from Zanzibar, as well as 80 NEC (National Executive
Committee of CCM) members.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has sent
a message of congratulations to the congress, praising CCM "has
been scoring gratifying achievements in the cause of leading the
Tanzanian people in safeguarding domestic stability and national
unity as well as in constructing the country and developing the
economy" since its founding 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
CCM, known as the Revolutionary Party, was founded on Feburary
5, 1977. Although multi-party elections were carried out in 1995,
the party secured its position as the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, retired Tanzanian
presidents Nyerere and Mwinyi, and a group of diplomatic envoys
have come to attend the congress being held at the newly-built
hall of Chimwaga.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening of the four-day congress, the incumbent
chairman, President Benjamin Mkapa, said that Tanzania will spare
no efforts to develop economy in the process of structural
adjustment.
</P>
<P>
The country will also create a sound environment for foreign
investment, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the top official of the party called on the
Tanzanian people to rely on themselves so as to get rid of
humiliation of foreign aid with attached political terms.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa also urged leaders at various levels to combat
corruption which has hampered economic development.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is a peace-loving nation which is willing to maintain
friendly and cooperative relationship with its neighbors and the
other countries in the world, and would solve political problems
with them through peaceful consultations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The congress will also amend the party constitution and set a
goal for the development in the next century.

<HEADLINE> 6 People Killed After Drinking "Odontol" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Six people have been killed
in Yaounde after drinking locally brewed whisky, known in
Cameroun's local parlance as "Odontol", said Cameroun Tribune
today.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the Yaounde Central Hospital said four died last
weekend in that hospital while a local chief in Nkolbisson (in
the outskirts of Yaounde) revealed that two villagers died after
drinking "Odontol".
</P>
<P>
Hospital sources said those dead had bought and drunk
"Odontol" in diverse areas in Yaounde.
</P>
<P>
Hospital sources told press that the drink contained highly
toxic elements but at present, they could not identify these
elements.
</P>
<P>
One person who also drank the toxic stuff is reported to have
gone blind and is currently grinding in pain at the Yaounde
Central Hospital.
</P>
<P>
The reports said reaction from the police has been swift. They
have clamped down and seized sizable quantities of "Odontol" in
most drinking spots in Yaounde.
</P>
<P>
The drinking of "Odontol", "Arki" or "Ha" is not a new
phenomenon in Cameroun, a country studded with unprecedented
economic crisis, said the paper, adding that with slashed
salaries, most Camerounians find solace in drinking this locally
brewed whisky which is five times less costly than refined beer
from breweries.

<P>
BAGHDAD, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed al-Sahhaf today informed U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan that a U.S. U2 spy plane accompanied by a formation of
American military aircraft had violated Iraqi air space.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Annan, Sahaf said that the U2 aircraft,
accompanied by American aircraft armed with various kinds of
weapons and spying equipment had, under military threat, violated
the sovereignty of an independent U.N. founding state, according
to the Iraqi news agency.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi foreign minister threatened to shoot down the U2 and
other American planes, saying that Iraq would respond in future
"in a manner that preserves Iraq's sovereignty and security."
</P>
<P>
He said in the letter that Iraq no longer recognize U2 flights
as part of the U.N. inspection program.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi military spokesman disclosed this morning that the
American U2 spy plane entered Iraqi airspace at 8:28 a.m. local
time at the Maaina Iraqi-Saudi borders, and left Iraqi airspace
at 11:28 a.m. local time, but was beyond the range of Iraqi
missiles that were all set and monitoring the aircraft.

ADDIS ABABA, Novemebr 10 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian minister of
transport and communications Abdulmejid Hussien today stressed
the importance of establishing a national information network in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a symposium which opened today at Africa Hall here
to mark the World Information Day to be celebrated on November
16, 1997, the minister said the Ethiopian government appreciates
the value of establishing a national information network and the
collective utilization of the resources.
</P>
<P>
He said information which has a supportive role in research
and development is a saleable commodity whose price continues to
soar up.
</P>
<P>
The minister said in developing countries such as Ethiopia,
users are neither sufficiently provided with timely and important
information nor have access to information bought at high price.
</P>
<P>
He said well organized information service encourages
investment and modern business activities and promotes
administrative capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Timely and useful data are vital for effecitve and acceptable
research findings, he added.
</P>
<P>
Some 25o participants are attending the three-day symposium in
which 20 study papers will be presented.
</P>
<P>
The symposium is part of celebrations to mark the World
Information Day in Ethiopia. The Ethiopian television will

<HEADLINE> US Reaps Good Harvest in Corn, Soybean in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. farmers reaped a
good harvest in corn and soybean as well as some other crops this
year, the Agriculture Department reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The department's latest official production forecast for corn
is some 9.36 billion bushels (one bushel of corn is about 24.42
kilograms), less than 1 percent above the October prediction,
which would be the third-largest crop on record. Farmers have
already harvested 75 percent of the corn, compared to an average
of 64 percent over the last five years.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, 89 percent of the nation's soybean crop has been
harvested, about 4 percentage points above the five-year average.
The soybean projection remained steady at 2.74 billion bushels
(one bushel of soybean is equivalent to 27.216 kilograms), setting
up a new record.
</P>
<P>
Projected corn prices were down this month to between 2.45
dollars and 2.85 dollars per bushel, caused in part by a 100
million-bushel drop in expected exports due to increased foreign
competition. Last year's price was 2.70 dollars a bushel.
</P>
<P>
Soybean prices, on the other hand, were raised to between 5.90
dollars and 6.90 dollars a bushel as estimated reserves were
reduced to 255 million bushels and farmers were rushing the crop
to market to take advantage of already strong prices. Last year's
soybean price was 7.38 dollars a bushel.
</P>
<P>
Corn yields on a per-acre basis were expected to average 126.4
bushels per acre. For soybeans, the per-acre yield was 39.2
bushels.
</P>
<P>
The department put cotton forecast at 18.8 million bales, a 2
percent rise from the October prediction but slightly down from
last year (one bale of cotton is 480 pounds). Although this year's
cotton harvest is the fourth largest ever, per-acre yields were
down 34 pounds at 673 pounds.
</P>
<P>
The average farm price for cotton was pegged at 68.5 cents per
pound, down slightly from last year.
</P>
<P>
Rice production was estimated at 180 million hundredweight, a 5
percent increase from last year's crop and the third-largest crop
on record. Yields were placed at 5,926 pounds per acre, up 19
pounds from the October forecast.
</P>
<P>
Rice prices were raised this month to between 9.25 dollars and
10.25 dollars per hundred pounds.
</P>
<P>
Sorghum, used mainly as an animal feed, was forecast at 659
million bushels, 1 percent lower than the October estimate and 18
percent below the 1996 crop. Farmers planted 20 percent less of
the crop this year.
</P>
<P>
Sorghum prices were down at between 2.15 dollars and 2.55
dollars a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Small Firms Contribute to US Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Small businesses account for
59 percent of the exporters in the United States, the local
newspaper the Journal of Commerce reported today.
</P>
<P>
The number of small exporters and the amount they ship overseas
are growing and most of them are planning to boost their export
programs, the paper quoted a survey as saying.
</P>
<P>
Companies with less than 20 employees are considered as small
businesses in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The portion of small companies in U.S. manufacturers rose to
over 18 percent today from less than 10 percent five years ago and
their growing contribution to exports has been spurred by cheaper
technology of exporting and increasing expertise.
</P>
<P>
The companies surveyed report the largest positive impact on
their business from electronic forms of payment, improved
package-tracking systems and e-mail.

JERUSALEM, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Palestinians
today held rallies in Gaza and the West Bank town of Ramallah to
show their solidarity with the Iraqi people, Jerusalem Media and
Communication Center (JMCC) reported.
</P>
<P>
Waving Iraqi flags and shouting slogans against the United
States, the demonstrators called on Arab nations to form a united
front against the U.S. and give their support to the Iraqi people
in this time of need.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian protesters in Gaza staged a sit-in demonstration
in front of the United Nations Representative Office to rally
support for the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The participants of both rallies, which went on peacefully,
strongly condemned the U.S. aggressive position toward the Iraqi
people and its biased stands on the Middle East peace process,
said the JMCC.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians believed that the Iraqi crisis is not caused by
Iraq's expulsion order of American arms inspectors, but due to
U.S. aggressive policies to destroy the whole of Iraq, the JMCC
quoted rally organizers as saying.
</P>
<P>
Iraq decided on October 29 to expel U.S. weapons inspectors
working with the U.N. Special Commission for dismantling Iraq's
mass destructive weapons, triggering a confrontation with the
United States.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Economic and trade cooperation
between China and Japan, the two countries whose economies are
highly complementary to each other, has good prospects for further
development after achieving fruitful results in recent years.
</P>
<P>
With the deepening of reforms, the advance of science and
technology and of the level of industrial production, China has
increased its export capability with greatly improved product
quality and an adjusted product mix, thus promoting the
development of foreign trade, including Sino-Japanese economic and
trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the overall Sino-Japanese trade volume
reached 60.06 billion U.S. dollars in 1996, with China becoming
Japan's second largest trading partner, and Japan becoming China's
largest trading partner.
</P>
<P>
This year saw further growth. Sino-Japanese trade increased
to 37.46 billion dollars in the first eight months of this year
and is expected to reach 65 billion dollars by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Economic cooperation also registered great progress. By the end
of 1996, Japan had set up nearly 15,000 companies and firms in
China with an actual investment at 14.2 billion dollars, becoming
China's largest foreign investor.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the improved investment environment in China and the
management skills of Japanese companies, the majority of the firms
with Japanese investment, mostly manufacturers, are successful in
yielding good returns. Many Japanese firms have expanded their
investment in China.
</P>
<P>
Since 1979, China has used a total of 1,610.9 billion yen in
loans, offered by the Japanese government in three packages, in 64
projects.
</P>
<P>
The fourth package of Japanese yen loans covers the five
years from 1996 to 2000. The loans for the first three years
amount to 580 billion yen in support of 40 projects in energy,
communications, environmental protection, agriculture and other
fields.
</P>
<P>
Okazaki Yugi, a member of the board of directors of the Japan
Association for the Promotion of International Trade, believes
that Sino-Japanese economic and trade cooperation will further
expand despite issues that demand immediate solution and new
subjects that need more exploration.
</P>
<P>
Japanese enterprises can play a role in the development of the
central and western areas of China, the construction of the Three
Gorges Dam and high speed railways in China, Okazaki said.
</P>
<P>
The future of economic and trade cooperation between China and
Japan should be a very bright one.

<HEADLINE> 5 Cholera Cases Reported in Angola's Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Five cases of cholera have
been reported in Luanda, the Angolan capital since it entered
into November this year.
</P>
<P>
According to a public notice issued here today by Luanda
Bureau of Health, this is the first cholera patients found in the
capital this year, which has caused extreme attention from the
local health authorities.
</P>
<P>
The health authorities urged the residents to take preventive
measures against cholera, such as drinking boiled water and
clearing garbage in the city.
</P>
<P>
Luanda Bureau of Health attributed the occurrence of the
epidemic to continuous heavy rains since the start of November,
piles of garbage in the city and reduced supply of tap water.
</P>
<P>
It said it will take every means possible to curb the spread
of the disease.

<HEADLINE> EU Pushes for Code of Conduct in Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 10 (Xinhua) -- European Union envoy for the
Middle East peace process Miguel Moratinos today met with Israeli
and Palestinian officials, proposing a code of conduct in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos held separate talks with Israeli Foreign Ministry's
Director-General Eitan Bentsur in Jerusalem and senior Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat in the West Bank town of Jericho to
discuss the proposal and the latest developments in the peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Under the code of conduct, both Israeli and Palestinian sides
should refrain from taking unilateral steps that could damage the
peace talks, and both sides should carry out educational
activities to promote coexistence between the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
As the proposal's main part, a permanent security committee,
which would consist of Israeli, Palestinian, American and EU
officials, would be set up to safeguard the implementation of the
signed agreements and bolster mutual confidence.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel seemed to take positive attitudes
toward the initiative.
</P>
<P>
This was a major step taken by the European Union to advance
the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, which were resumed early last
month due to the mediation by the United States.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Happy About Failure of Scientology Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Germany today applauded the
failure of a U.S. Congress resolution which protested Germany's
treatment of Scientologists.
</P>
<P>
The rejection of the resolution by a big majority at the U.S.
House of Representatives showed that "reason has prevailed among
U.S. members of parliament," German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
was quoted by the German news agency DPA as saying in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
However, he also admitted that more clarification work on the
issue had to be done by Germany in Washington.
</P>
<P>
German government spokesman Peter Hausmann today said that the
rejection of the resolution showed that the Scientology issue had
not put a strain on the German-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which accused the German government of discrimination
against Scientologists, was rejected by a vote of 318 to 101 at
the U.S. House of Representatives Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that those who voted against the resolution had
described it as not well-balanced and detrimental to the
German-U.S ties.
</P>
<P>
Supporters, however, argued that on the issue of religious
freedom, dialogue must be able to be conducted even between close
allies.
</P>
<P>
Scientology has been recognized as a church eligible for
tax-free status in the United States since 1993. But it is not the
case in Germany which says that the group exploits the
insecurities of its members to extract profits from
self-improvement courses. It is also accused of suppressing its
members' freedoms guaranteed under the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The group has been put under nationwide observation by German
counter-intelligence agents since earlier this year after interior
ministers from Germany's 16 states decided that Scientology posed
a possible threat to democracy.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Vows to Act Against US Spy Flight Over Its Skies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraq told the United
Nations today that it no longer recognizes the U.S.-manned U2
flight as part of the U.N. arms inspection and "will act" against
such flights to preserve the country's "sovereignty and security."
</P>
<P>
The statement was made in a letter to U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan from Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Said al-Sahhaf.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister confirmed the reports that an American U2
spy plane flew over Iraq early today despite Iraq threats to shoot
it down.
</P>
<P>
But Baghdad said that the plane, which reportedly crossed into
southern Iraq from northern Saudi Arabia, flew outside the range
of its gunners and the Iraqi forces monitored the aircraft with
radar until it left Iraqi airspace three hours later.
</P>
<P>
The flight "violated under military threat the sovereignty of
an independent state and a founding member of the United Nations,"
al-Sahhaf said.
</P>
<P>
"On the basis of the foregoing, it is no longer one of the U.N.
means of the alleged (weapons) inspection, both in form and name,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The letter came only hours before the U.N. Security Council is
scheduled to review the serious crisis in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister warned that Iraq forces "will act towards
this plane and other American aircraft violating our skies
pursuant to this description in a manner that preserves Iraq's
sovereignty and security."
</P>
<P>
No comments were immediately available from the United Nations
on al-Sahhaf's letter to the U.N. chief.

<HEADLINE> Annan Repeats Call for Iraq's Full Compliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan today repeated his call for Baghdad's full compliance
with the U.N. resolutions on arms inspection in Iraq and its
cooperation with the United Nations on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the appeal after meeting with Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz at the U.N. headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Aziz, who arrived in New York earlier in the day via Concorde
from Paris, explained to the U.N. chief Iraq's position on the
U.N. arms inspection, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
Later today, the U.N. chief was briefed on the unsuccessful
trip made by three envoys last week to Baghdad to persuade Iraq to
reverse its decision on the U.N. weapons inspection on its
territory.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has insisted that Americans in the U.N. arms verification
team were not allowed to take part in the inspection, alleging
that they are American spies.
</P>
<P>
Annan said in a statement that during his meeting with Aziz he
"underscored the message" his envoys had taken to Baghdad,
"stressing that all that was required was for Iraq to undertake to
comply fully with its obligations under all relevant Security
Council resolutions."
</P>
<P>
"Once that was done, I would expect that the Security
Council, in turn, would be prepared to listen to the concerns of
the government of Iraq," he added.
</P>
<P>
Annan and his envoys will inform this afternoon the Security
Council of his initiative to resolve the stalemate on Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Iran Ready for Military Exercises With Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian military
officer today voiced Iran's readiness to hold joint exercises with
Gulf Arab states, the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Commander of Iran's navy Abbas Mohtaj said that cooperation on
a common defense scheme with the southern littoral states of the
Gulf was a matter of doctrine for Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said that peace and stability in the strategic Gulf would be
restored by the regional states on the basis of common interests
and reliance on their defense capability.
</P>
<P>
Mohtaj said the "Victory 8" war games staged by the Iranian
navy in the Gulf last month had a message of brotherhood and
cooperation on a common defense scheme with the Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recent call by the Kuwaiti Defense Minister
Sheikh Salem Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah to hold a joint naval
exercise with Iran, he said that Iran's defense policy was based
on cooperation with all Islamic states, particularly the Gulf
states.
</P>
<P>
"We regard the call... as a response to Iran's friendly
initiatives on forming a new security arrangement in the Persian
Gulf without presence of any external forces," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani Saturday also expressed
Iran's readiness to hold joint naval exercises with Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He said that launching joint maneuvers with Gulf states was
essential for the peace and security in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Iran has launched a series of diplomatic initiatives to improve
relations with Gulf states in an effort to break the West-imposed
isolation. Iran's Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi is currently on
a "confidence-building" trip starting from Sunday to the six Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) states.

<HEADLINE> MCI Agrees to Be Merged by WorldCom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 10 (Xinhua) -- MCI Communications Corp., the
second largest telecommunications player in the U.S., agreed today
to be bought by WorldCom Inc. for 37 billion U.S. dollars in what
would be the largest corporate merger in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
The offer by WorldCom, the fourth largest long distance company
in the U.S., is 20 percent more than the original bidding.
</P>
<P>
A number of companies have been bidding for buying MCI since
last year. The British Telecommunications Plc (BT) had a 24
billion U.S. dollar merger agreement with MCI. And the GTE Corp.
offered a 28 billion U.S. dollar all-cash deal.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the agreement between MCI and WorldCom strikes a
big blow to GTE.
</P>
<P>
BT will be paid 465 million U.S. dollars because MCI broke its
previous contract to merge with BT, according to reports here. The
British company, which also agreed to the deal, will receive 7.0
billion U.S. dollars from WorldCom for its 20 percent stake in
MCI.
</P>
<P>
The new company will be called MCI WorldCom and will have more
than 30 billion U.S. dollars in annual revenue next year.
</P>
<P>
WorldCom also will assume 5 billion U.S. dollars in MCI debt.
</P>
<P>
The deal will become the largest U.S. merger so far. The
previous record was set by a 25.6 billion U.S. dollar marriage
between Bell Atlantic Corp. and Nynex Corp. in August.
</P>
<P>
The combined MCI-WorldCom will be able to sell a full range of
services, from local and long-distance to Internet connections to
22 million customers in the United States and 200 other countries,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Any deal will require approval from government regulators.
</P>
<P>
The new marriage, if approved by government regulators, will
pose the fiercest challenge to AT&AMP;T Corp.'s once-solid monopoly
on long-distance phone service, according to analysts.

<HEADLINE> Gore: U-2 Will Continue Flying Over Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Vice President Al Gore
today vowed that U.S. spy planes would continue to fly over Iraq
for U.N. weapons inspections and said Iraq had no right to
challenge their flights.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to continue activities such as the U-2 flights,"
Gore said at a Pentagon news conference. "We're going to insist...
that Iraq observe the United Nations resolutions in every
particular."
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on an Iraqi letter to the United Nations
saying it did not recognize the U-2 flights as part of the U.N.
program, Gore said, "It is not for Iraq to decide whether it
recognizes what forces make up the U.N. inspection effort."
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen confirmed at the same news
conference that a U-2 spy plane mission over central Iraq was
completed without direct threats from Iraqi forces.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said it was important that the Security Council, which
was meeting in New York today over the Iraqi crisis, insisted
there be "no exceptions, no negotiations" with Iraq on complying
with U.N. resolutions that authorize weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the White House said President Bill Clinton was
"satisfied that the (U-2) mission went forward."
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Clinton now wanted the
U.N. Security Council to issue an "unambiguous and strong
statement" on resuming weapons inspections, which have been
suspended for a week during talks between U.N. envoys and Iraqi
officials over the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
The U-2 spy plane resumed its flight early today on orders from
the United Nations after a week's delay.
</P>
<P>
The surveillance plane, protectively watched by other U.S. jets
from "no-fly" zones in northern and southern Iraq, crossed the
Iraqi border from Saudi Arabia and stayed over Iraq for some three
hours.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqis were said to have found the plane but did not shoot
as the plane was out of range of anti-aircraft missiles.

<HEADLINE> Annan Regrets Over Iraq's Refusal to Reverse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan today expressed his regret over Iraq's refusal to
rescind its decision on banning American U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief made the remarks after meeting with Iraqi Deputy
Prime Minister Tareq Aziz at his office at the U.N. headquarters
in New York this noon.
</P>
<P>
Before his meeting, Annan told reporters that he would expect
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to give Aziz some flexibility and
hope to hear the answer that Baghdad would reverse its decision
which had caused the serious crisis.
</P>
<P>
"He (Aziz) has not yet given us the answer we hoped for," Annan
said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"I regret that the government of Iraq has not yet seen its way
to ending this unfortunate situation by complying with the
requirements of the (U.N. Security) Council," Annan told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The United States said today that it would seek tougher
sanctions against Iraq when the U.N. Security Council is going to
meet later today or Tuesday. Washington is also threatening to
take military actions.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he would report to a closed-door council meeting on
his talks with Aziz and on a report by his special mission to
Baghdad last week. The three-member mission failed to persuade
Iraq to reverse its decision on the U.S. arms inspectors.

<HEADLINE> Kohl's Party Rejects Dual Nationality for Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 10 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party today voted
against allowing foreigners living in Germany to acquire dual
nationality.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the CDU executive committee today also decided that
it would support allowing children of foreigners to become German
nationals provided that they had grown up in Germany, attended
German schools and did not have a criminal record, CDU General
Secretary Peter Hintze said.
</P>
<P>
The decisions, however, failed to satisfy the junior partner in
Kohl's ruling coalition, the Free Democratic Party (FDP), which
has been calling for more fundamental reforms of the country's
citizenship laws.
</P>
<P>
The citizenship issue has been subject to heated debates in
Germany in recent years given the fact that the country's foreign
population has run up to about 7.3 million, or 9 percent of the
total population.
</P>
<P>
Many Germans have meanwhile come to believe that Germany
already has been a society of varied races and cultures and there
is an urgent need to integrate foreigners who have settled here in
order to defuse rising social tensions.
</P>
<P>
However, there are also fears that easing the German
citizenship law, which is based on the principle of inherited
nationality, would lead to a new influx of foreigners to Germany.

<HEADLINE> Tehran Mayor Barred from Traveling Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein
Karbaschi was barred from travelling abroad after he was charged
of involving in some embezzlements by district mayors, local
evening daily Resalat reported today.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi was summoned again to a court in Tehran to offer
explanations about the charges against him.
</P>
<P>
The court judge issued an order to bar Karbaschi from
traveling abroad and released him from the court on bail of 5
billion rials (about 1.67 million U.S. dollars), the report said.
</P>
<P>
Several district mayors of Tehran city and some assistants of
the Tehran mayor were arrested for involving in embezzlement
cases and it was believed that Karbaschi also was involved in
some cases.
</P>
<P>
The case of the Tehran mayor has caused sharp political
struggles among rival factions. The hardline conservatives urged
to punish Karbaschi while the moderates said the case was aimed at
weakening the executive branch of the country.
</P>
<P>
"The sensational allegations leveled at the mayor are not
related to him and stem from the defeat of a certain faction in
the presidential election," said Behzad Nabavi, former minister
of Heavy Industries and a strong supporter of President Mohammad
Khatami.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the defeated rival factions are influential in
government institutions except in the executive branch, so
naturally they plan to gradually discredit and undermine this
branch of the government to the extent that it could not
implement its plans and objectives."

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG, Sierra Leone to Meet on Military's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Commander of the west African
peacekeeping force (ECOMOG), Major-General Victor Malu, is to
meet with Major Johnny Paul Koroma, head of the Sierra Leonean
military junta this week on the latter's quit from power.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here said today that the two will meet on
Wednesday near Freetown. It did not give the exact venue of the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Malu and Koroma were expected to meet last Friday, but the
talk was cancelled by Koroma, who declined to go to the
ECOMOG-controlled Lungi area in the suburbs of Freetown for
safety reason.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's talks are expected to focus on the implementation
of the Conakary agreement signed last month in Guinea, by which
Koroma is obligated to return power to ousted civilian president
Ahemd Tejan Kabbah by April next year.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, ECOMOG and Koroma's men had met twice
at the ECOMOG base near Freetown since the Conakary agreement,
and had agreed to hold further talks on a 15-point agenda, five
of which were suggested by Koroma.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the talks said the top issue forwarded by
Koroma is the release from detention in Nigeria of Foday Sankoh,
leader of the Revolutionary United Front, a former rebel group
that has become the ally of Koroma after the May 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are also expected to discuss the embargo on
Sierra Leone initiated by the Economic Community of West African
States and later adopted by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG insists that the embargo will remain until the handover
in April next year, but Koroma demands that it be lifted right
now.
</P>
<P>
Other topics on the agenda include exchange of prisoners
during the clashes between ECOMOG and Koroma's troops in the last
few months, and the setting up of a monitoring group to supervise
the handover process.

<HEADLINE> Aziz Urges UN to Listen to Iraqi Legitimate Requests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi government
had not changed its position on banning Americans in the United
Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) and the weapons inspection
teams, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz stressed here today.
</P>
<P>
Aziz also said and the UN Security Council should pay attention
and listen to the legitimate requests of the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting with UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan and President of the Security Council Qin Huasun, Aziz
said the Iraqi government had cooperated with the UN and it did
not intent to seek confrontations and conflicts with the UN
Security Council and the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister said Iraq could not accept the
imbalance of the representation of the UNSCOM and the weapons
inspection team, in which Americans accounted for 44 percent in
1996 and 32 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the leading posts of the UNSCOM at the UN
Headquarters were also dominated by Americans, who were
implementing the policies of the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said Iraq decided to ban U-2 flights because they were
spying Iraqi information for the U.S. government which was against
Iraqi national security and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
He said the UN sanctions on Iraq had been in the place since
1991 which had brought bitterness to the Iraqi people, and Iraq
had made its efforts to comply with the commitments of relevant
resolutions of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said it was high time for the international community to
consider the lifting of the sanctions on Iraq so that the Iraqi
people could have a normal life.
</P>
<P>
Aziz arrived here this morning for talks aimed at finding a
diplomatic way out of the current crisis over the arms inspections
which started late October.

<HEADLINE> Women Are Prime Suffers of Natural Degradation: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A study carried out by
the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA)
revealed that natural resource degradation precipitated by the
ever increasing population explosion has more adverse
consequences on women than men.
</P>
<P>
"Women are the forefront victims of poverty which is the major
outcome of natural and environmental degradation," the study
said.
</P>
<P>
It said "women, particularly in developing countries, are
compelled to produce food grain on barren lands heavily leached
by several natural calamities."
</P>
<P>
They are also forced to trek longer distances in search of
safe drinking water and fuel wood as nearby forests and springs
have already been drained and depleted, the study said.
</P>
<P>
It is mostly women's duty to look after members of a family at
times of epidemics and other natural disasters, the study noted.
</P>
<P>
The impacts of natural degradation are further aggravated by
the fact that women are deprived of their rights to get access to
decision making activities, educational opportunities and land
ownership, the study pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Empowerment of women, raising their role in natural resources
protection activities, and ensuring their right to get access to
various social services could alleviate women's problem which is
worsened by natural degradation, the study added.

<P>
NICOSIA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Presidential Emissary
for Cyprus Richard Holbrooke arrived here this evening for
meetings with leaders of the two communities on Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for Holbrooke to visit Cyprus after his
appointment by U.S. President Bill Clinton last June.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after his arrival Holbrooke had a meeting with
President Glafcos Clerides. He then crossed into the
Turkish-controlled northern part of Nicosia to meet Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Holbrooke is expected to have a joint meeting with
Clerides and Denktash at the Ledra Palace Hotel, situated in the
U.N.-controlled buffer zone of the capital.
</P>
<P>
It would be the first face-to-face meeting between Clerides and
Denktash in the presence of the U.S. envoy.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department Spokesman James Rubins stated last week
that the meeting would be informal and there would be no specific
agenda.
</P>
<P>
Clerides has said Holbrooke's visit signals the start of a
U.S. initiative in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke is accompanied by State Department Special
Coordinator for Cyprus Thomas Miller, who arrived here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Miller, who had separate meetings with Clerides and Denktash
today, said that he is trying to make progress toward a Cyprus
settlement.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus problem has remained unresolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkey landed its troops and took over
the northern third part following a short-lived coup by some
Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.

LUSAKA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Zambian former president, now
leader of the opposition United National Independence Party
(UNIP), Kenneth Kaunda said today that he will continue to lobby
for a stop to international economic aid to the Zambian
government.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda made the statement in London in an interview with CNN.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Richard Sakala, Zambia's presidential aide for
press and public relations, rapped Kaunda here today, saying that
the UNIP leader has no care for Zambians by calling for a
continued international economic squeeze on Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Some western countries suspended their financial aid to Zambia
in 1996 in protest against a constitutional amendment bill, which
in fact barred Kaunda from contesting the presidency in the
elections held in November of the year because of Kaunda's
parents are Malawian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
After the elections the west resumed aid to the country, but
Zambian opposition parties have been urging the western countries
to keep their squeeze on the government to pressure it into
dialogue with the opposition parities.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Urges Easing of Iraqi Sufferings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today urged the easing of sufferings of the Iraqi people while
calling upon Baghdad to comply with the United Nations resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak made the statement upon returning home after a few
hours' visit to Saudi Arabia to coordinate stances with Saudi
leaders on the controversial Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
economic conference to be held in Qatar on November 16-18.
</P>
<P>
The Mideast peace developments, bilateral ties, the outcome of
his recent tour of the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Bahrain were
also covered in his talks with Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz and
Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz, Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
He said he sent a message to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
upon the flareup of the crisis after an Iraqi decision to dispel
U.S. arms inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission in charge of
dismantling Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The president said that Egypt's view is that Iraq should abide
by resolutions of the U.N. Security Council to avoid escalation of
U.N. sanctions against Iraq, so that the situation may remain
within the framework of a political solution and avoid the use of
force.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the aim of Egypt is to ease the suffering of
the Iraqi people. He described as inappropriate the principle of
using force.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt is also keen that there should be no division of Iraq as
much as Egypt is keen that there should be no division in Sudan or
any Arab countries," Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has barred U.N. weapon inspection teams that included
Americans for a seventh day. It has charged that the American
inspectors are spies trying to prolong the U.N. sanctions imposed
after the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.

LONDON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary
George Robertson reaffirmed here today Britain's tough stance
towards Iraq, saying Baghdad's banning of American arms inspectors
was "a step too far."
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government has decided to ban American experts from
taking part in an arms inspection team of the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) on Iraq, accusing them of undertaking spy
activities on behalf of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Robertson told reporters early today that Britain's Labor
government would ensure that "the world community's view is
delivered to Saddam Hussein in the toughest and most robust way
that is possible."
</P>
<P>
"I think he (Saddam Hussein) realises now in Baghdad that the
world community is united. This was a step too far and UNSCOM
inspectors must be allowed to do their job unhindered by his
intransigence," he said.
</P>
<P>
The British Defense Secretary, who refused to rule out the
possibility of using military means to resolve the current crisis,
said: "We are not talking about any of the options we are
considering."
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair Sunday pledged his support
for the United States in its row with Iraq over the UN arms
inspection in Iraq.

CAIRO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Copts in Egypt today expressed
their unequivocal rejection to all forms of U.S. intervention in
Egypt's internal affairs under the pretext of safeguarding the
rights of its religious minority.
</P>
<P>
A group of leading Coptic figures and Muslim and Christian
scholars made the stand clear in a statement to reject the call by
some U.S. Congress members for a U.S. intervention to protect the
Copts of Egypt allegedly being religiously persecuted.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the U.S. excuse "harms Egypt as a whole, the
history of Egypt's Copts and rekindles the flames of the country's
sectarian climate."
</P>
<P>
The statement, released under the title of "A statement to the
nation," also brushed off U.S. threats to suspend foreign aid to
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Foreign intervention under the pretext of safeguarding the
Copts is popularly dismissed and has been aborted through the
years, it said.
</P>
<P>
"Since the dawn of history, the Copts of Egypt have confronted
all threats to the country and believed that the interest of the
nation is supreme," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Copts reject any foreign intervention in their affairs, it
added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. has been accusing Cairo of persecuting Copts, whose 6
million population constitutes a tenth of Egypt's whole.

BAGHDAD, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has received the first
shipment of foodstuffs within the framework of the second phase of
the oil-for-food deal between Iraq and the United Nations, a

supplies to Iraq within the first phase of the deal, which ended
on June 8, amounted to 2.5 million tonnes. However, he added that
only 40 percent of medicines and medical equipment were received
during the period.
</P>
<P>
So far, Iraq has received no shipment of medicine under the
second phase of the accord which started on June 9.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal which was launched last December,
Iraq is allowed to export 2 billion dollars worth of oil over six
months to buy food and medicine for the Iraqi people who are
suffering under the U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions cannot be lifted until the U.N. weapons
inspection teams certify that Iraq has eliminated all its weapons
of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly accused the United States of blocking the
lift of the sanctions and the approval of its contracts submitted
to the U.N. committee in charge of approving its contracts with
other countries.

LUSAKA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) will promote sustained improvements in the
survival, development and welfare of Zambian women and children
during the year 1997 to 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to an UNICEF program available here today, it will
address not only the immediate needs of the children, but also to
develop strategies to address the underlying causes of these
problems.
</P>
<P>
It will take actions to position the children and women at the
centre of Zambia's reform and development agenda, to increase
their access to quality services and to strengthen community and
family capacities to protect and care for the children.
</P>
<P>
It plans to halt the increasing infant and young child
mortality and stabilize the under five mortality rate below 200
per 1,000 live births.
</P>
<P>
Infant mortality rates in the country have risen to 113 from
80 per 1,000 live births since the 1980's and under five
mortality rates have increased from 150 to 202 per 1,000.
</P>
<P>
The figures are expected to swell by as much as 20 and 45
percent respectively by the year 2,000 due to rising HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
These rates, combined with increased adult deaths due to AIDS
related illnesses, have resulted in a drop in adult life
expectancy from 54 years in the mid 1980's to 45.5 in the 1990's.

<HEADLINE> U.S. President Decides to Shelve "Fast-Track" Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives put off the decisive vote over "fast-track" trade
bill at the request of President Bill Clinton, a major political
defeat for the White House this year.
</P>
<P>
Due to lack of support from his own party, Clinton told House
Speaker Newt Gingrich in a telephone call this morning to drop
efforts to pass the so-called "fast track" bill. It means that
there will be another difficult battle for the legislation next
year.
</P>
<P>
The decision came after the House stayed in session past
midnight in an unsuccessful attempt to gather enough votes.
</P>
<P>
"The president will be committed to opening markets overseas
using whatever tools are available to him," stated White House
spokesman Mike McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
House GOP leaders said the president was informed late Sunday
night that he was about a half-dozen votes short of winning, but
that they gave him the final say on whether to "pull" the bill.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time over the past week Clinton had requested
a delay.
</P>
<P>
Critics, including labor unions and environmental groups, argue
it does not do enough to require presidents to consider wages,
working conditions and environmental standards when dealing with
the U.S. overseas trading partners.
</P>
<P>
Most Republicans and corporate America support the measure.
</P>
<P>
The "fast-track" authority allows Congress to simply approve or
reject trade agreements negotiated by the administration, but not
amend them. The administration wanted the power to accelerated the
procedures for a proposed free-trade pact with Chile, and to enter
into other new trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Presidents, for decades, have had the authority, but it
has lapsed.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Senate Vote on Civil Rights Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Monday appealed to the full Senate to vote on the nomination of
Bill Lann Lee to head the Justice Department's civil rights
division.
</P>
<P>
With Lee alongside him at a White House conference on hate
crimes, Clinton said the Senate Judiciary Committee should not
kill Lee's nomination as assistant attorney general for civil
rights because he supports affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
"It is wrong to deny this man that job because he agrees with
the policies of his president on that issue," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"With all respect, if we have to wait until we get a head of
the civil rights division who is opposed to affirmative action,
that job will be vacant for a very long time," he said.
</P>
<P>
Senator Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee
and a Republican, said on Sunday that as far as right now Lee's
nomination is dead. Clinton asked that Hatch send the nomination
forward for a vote anyway, without a committee recommendation.
</P>
<P>
"Let all 100 senators stand up and be counted in the full view
of the American people," Clinton said at the conference.
</P>
<P>
Hatch rejected a request by committee Democrats for another
hearing so that Lee could answer charges that he has been an
advocate of racial and gender preferences.
</P>
<P>
Democrats on the Judiciary Committee last week sought the
further hearing and postponement of the vote on Lee when it became
apparent it would turn out 9-9. Tie votes count as a rejection.
</P>
<P>
Senator Patrick Leahy, a ranking Democrat on the Judiciary
Committee, accused Republicans of using Lee for political
purposes.
</P>
<P>
Republican leaders are out to please extremists in their party
who oppose relief when equal opportunity is denied to women or
minorities in the workplace, he said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq: No Intent to Cut Cooperation With UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraq did not intend to stop
its cooperation with U.N. inspectors, a letter sent by Iraqi
Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz to U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said in his letter that Iraq had actually been cooperating
with the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) throughout the
past six and half years.
</P>
<P>
The letter, published by the Iraqi News Agency today, was in
response to the message of Annan to Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, which was delivered on November 3 by Lakhdar Ibrahimi who
headed a U.N. team to Baghdad to help defuse the Iraq-U.N. crisis.
</P>
<P>
Aziz accused some members of the UNSCOM of violating the rules
of neutral and professional work, threatening Iraq's security and
prolonging the on-going U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq decided on October 29 to expel the 10 U.S. inspectors on
the U.N. arms inspection teams, holding them responsible for
delaying the lifting of the economic sanctions imposed by the
U.N. Security Council since its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said in his letter that the visit by Ibrahimi provided
Iraq the first opportunity to make public important facts about
what some arms inspectors had done and what Iraq and its people
had suffered since 1991.
</P>
<P>
He complained that after six and half years, Iraq still could
not see any signs to end the bitter sufferings of its people and
the continued threat to its security under the cover of the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed the necessity to seek a solution to the sufferings
and threats.
</P>
<P>
Aziz called on the U.N. Secretary General to take an impartial
and just stand to put the sufferings of Iraq and its people before
the Security Council for debate.
</P>
<P>
He also called for maintenance of the dialog with Iraq whenever
Annan found it possible and useful.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Denounces Turkish Invasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi Foreign Ministry
today strongly denounced Turkish invasion of northern Iraq on
November 8.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Iraqi news agency, a spokesman of the
ministry said that a group of Turkish armed forces, supported by
tanks and vehicles, carried out a "new invasion" of northern
Iraq, and were still making headway inside Iraqi territory.
</P>
<P>
This aggression inflicted heavy damages upon lives and
properties of the Kurdish people, besides losses in public
properties, he said.
</P>
<P>
He asked the Turkish government to pull out its troops
immediately from Iraqi territory and to refrain from such
invasions which were contrary to the U.N. Charter, the principles
of international law and good neighboring relations.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government strongly condemned the new Turkish
military aggression and denounced the violation of Iraqi
sovereignty and integrity by the Turkish armed forces, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman emphasized that the restoration of legitimate
authority in northern Iraq was the only guarantee for the
establishment of security and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has in recent years frequently launched cross-border
military operations into northern Iraq in an attempt to wipe out
its outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) rebels taking
shelter there. The PKK has been fighting for autonomy in eastern
and southeastern Turkey since 1984.

<HEADLINE> Significant Ceremonial Site Discovered in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- British archaeologists have
discovered evidence of a prehistoric ceremonial temple at least as
"old and significant" as Stonehenge, a stone monument built by
ancient Britons.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the ruins, thought to be 5,000 years old, was
described by English Heritage officials today as the most exciting
archaeological find in Britain for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Traces of the temple -- in well defined pits within a 135-meter
circular ditch -- were found after archaeologists used sensitive
ground-scanning instruments below an ancient site of Stone Circles
at Stanton Drew near the southwestern English port of Bristol, an
official at English Heritage said.
</P>
<P>
"(The find) is as old and comparable in significance to the
megalith monument at Stonehenge, although twice its size," an
official statement reported.
</P>
<P>
Officials said until now the site had been concealed by a
series of well-known stone circles.
</P>
<P>
Sir Jocelyn Stevens, chairman of English Heritage, the
government department responsible for preserving historic sites,
told a news conference he thought the complex structure was built
as a "symbol of power" by people seeking to control the
supernatural.
</P>
<P>
Geoffrey Wainwright, English Heritage's chief archaeologist,
said they have about 3,000 stone circles in Britain but previously
only seven timber temples. The Stanton Drew find is by far the
largest, twice as big as anything previously discovered.
</P>
<P>
Wainwright said that the timber temples were probably
constructed around 3,000 BC, pre-dating stone circles, such as
Stonehenge, which began around 2,500BC.

<HEADLINE> IBM Sees Breakthrough in Data Storage for PCs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM), the world's leading computer maker, is
unveiling a personal-computer disk drive that can store up to
eight times more information than currently available in an
average desktop computer.
</P>
<P>
It said the first drive with the new technology, the Deskstar
16GP, will be available next month and will hold 16.8 gigabytes
of data.
</P>
<P>
The new drive comes just two weeks after Quantum Corp.,
another major hard disk producer, unveiled its Bigfoot hard disk
drive, whose capacity stands at 12 gigabytes.
</P>
<P>
However, IBM's product is a 3.5-inch-diameter drive while
Quantum's new drive is 5.25 inches across.
</P>
<P>
IBM's new 16.8-gigabyte drive, which the company will display
next week in Las Vegas in California at the Comdex computer trade
show, can hold up to eight hours of full-motion video, according
to a newspaper report. By contrast, the average hard drive
capacity last year was 1.2 gigabytes, up from an average of just
200 megabytes in 1993.
</P>
<P>
IBM said it will use the drives in its own computers and also
sell them to other PC makers. It said that about 60 companies,
including Dell Computer Corp. and Gateway 2000 Inc., are
evaluating the drives.
</P>
<P>
IBM's Deskstar is based on a new technology called "giant
magnetoresistive heads," which are devices no bigger than the head
of a pin that "write and read information."
</P>
<P>
The company said its new Deskstar stores 2.7 billion bits of
computer data per square inch of disk, up from 1.7 billion bits in
its 8.4-gigabyte model.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Japanese PM Vow to Promote Sino-Japanese Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Li Peng
and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto held talks here
today, vowing to expand and deepen cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, which began about four hours after the
Chinese premier arrived here for a six-day official good-will
visit to Japan, Li and Hashimoto said Sino-Japanese relations
have been progressing well since the two countries normalized
their ties 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The exchanges and cooperation in all areas between the two
countries have scored "remarkable progress," they said.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Japanese relations are in a very important historic
period, as the world is ushering in the 21st century, they said,
adding that the two countries should further develop their
friendly relations, expand and deepen their cooperation in all
areas.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, who visited China in September, said he is very
happy to receive Li in Japan as the two countries celebrate the
25th anniversary of the normalization of ties this year.
</P>
<P>
Li said the purpose of his trip is to "reaffirm with the
Japanese side, joint efforts to establish the long-term, stable
and good-neighborly Sino-Japanese relations oriented to the 21st
century, and to finally realize the goal of maintaining
Sino-Japanese friendship from generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
"We have always maintained that to adhere to the principles
enshrined in the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement and the China-Japan
Treaty of Peace and Friendship constitutes both the political
basis of the development of Sino-Japanese relations, and the
guiding principles governing the settlement of the remaining
issues between the two countries," Li said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries should deal in a timely manner with whatever
problems arise and prevent the overall development of bilateral
relations from being interrupted and affected, Li added.
</P>
<P>
"We have taken note of the statement and promises made by Prime
Minister Hashimoto during (his) China visit, and hope the Japanese
side will honor and carry out its promises," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said Japan's position to abide by the Joint Statement
and the Treaty will remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, Hashimoto said Japan will not support the
ideas of "two Chinas" and Taiwan's independence.
</P>
<P>
Li said both China and Japan are important countries in the
Asia-Pacific region and in the world at large.
</P>
<P>
With profound changes in the region and the world, and the
growing trend of multipolarization, China and Japan should cherish
their current relations and further develop their long-term
friendship, which is not only in the fundamental interests of the
two countries and the two peoples, but conducive to peace and
development in the region and the world, Li added.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, Li said, China and Japan must treat
Sino-Japanese relations from a "long-term and strategic
perspective" and guide the developmental direction of their
relations.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said it is crucial for Japan and China to increase
dialogue and cooperation in forging relations into the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Both sides expressed congratulations over the signing of a new
fishery agreement between the two countries. They noted that the
agreement was signed in the spirit of cooperation, mutual
understanding and accommodation, and with respect to history. They
believe the new agreement will play a positive role in promoting
bilateral cooperation in the fishery area.
</P>
<P>
Li also expressed appreciation to Hashimoto and the Japanese
government in helping advance the process of China's entry into
the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said Japan will continue its effort to speed up the
talks between China and WTO members. Japan hopes other countries
can reach agreements with China on this issue.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the economic and trade ties between China and
Japan, Li said both countries, which are formulating economic
development projects facing the 21st century, should take the
opportunity to establish long-term and stable ties for economic
cooperation and trade on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that there is an immense potential and bright
prospects for Sino-Japanese economic and trade cooperation as long
as the two countries can handle existing problems that remain
unresolved and do not interfere with the development of
Sino-Japanese friendship.
</P>
<P>
Li briefed Hashimoto on the recent state visit by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin to the United States and the state visit by
Russian President Boris Yeltsin to China. Hashimoto gave an
account of his trips to Russia and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Li said the world is becoming more multipolarized, and peace
and development have become the mainstream of the times.
</P>
<P>
Major powers should play the role of promoting peace and
development, Li said, adding that China is willing to work with
other countries to help establish a fair and reasonable new world
order.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Hashimoto invited Chinese President Jiang
Zemin to visit Japan next year, which marks the 20th anniversary
of the signing of the Japan-China Treaty of Peace and Friendship.
</P>
<P>
Li told Hashimoto that President Jiang has agreed in principle
to visit Japan next year.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Chinese government, Li invited the crown
prince of Japan and his wife to visit China next year.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Li and Hashimoto watched the signing of the
China-Japan fishery agreement and an exchange of notes on a
Sino-Japanese development fund project.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Poverty Challenges Asian-Pacific Economies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The two-day Fifth Asian and
Pacific Ministerial Conference on Social Development ended here
today with delegates agreeing that poverty reduction remains a
"very formidable" challenge for the region's economies in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
The conference, organized by United Nations Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), was attended by
ministers from 26 economies in the region and dozens of
representatives from some international and regional
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the meeting, a senior officials' meeting was held here
on November 5-8 to review progress made by ESCAP economies in
implementing the Agenda for Action on social development they
signed three years ago in Manila, in the context of the Program of
Action signed at the World Summit for Social Development in
Denmark in 1995.
</P>
<P>
During the ministerial meeting, the delegates reviewed the
social development situation and prospects of the region into the
next century, and discussed ways to accelerate social development
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Bearing in mind the three core targets of social development --
poverty alleviation, employment expansion and social integration,
they agreed that poverty remains the prime obstacle to the social
development in the region.
</P>
<P>
Despite economic advances made in the past five decades, the
region is still home to three-quarters of the world's poor.
According to the World Bank, the number of poor people living in
absolute poverty in the region grew from some 960 million in 1987
to 1.3 billion in 1993, increasing by 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, poverty no longer exists only in the countryside.
For example, in Bangladesh in 1993, rural poor numbered 43
million, more than seven times the number of poor in the cities.
But as people flee farms for cities, the number of poor in urban
areas is growing quickly.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that in about 12 years, one out of every two
poor people living in Bangladesh will be found in cities.
</P>
<P>
Geographically, South Asia remains the epicenter of poverty.
About 43.1 percent of its population was living below the poverty
line. The situation in East and Southeast Asia has been improved
markedly due to fast economic growth and there are 26 percent of
the people living below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
Central Asian economies, which are undergoing economic
transformation, saw their incidence of poverty rise to 60 percent
while a significant part of the population in Pacific island
economies is poor.
</P>
<P>
The cause of poverty is a combination of factors, including
slow pace of economic growth, high pressure of population, the
spread of AIDS and illegal drugs, the lack of education, the lack
of creditor economic support, the frequency of natural calamities,
the degradation of the environment and the discrimination against
women and other disadvantaged groups.
</P>
<P>
Most ESCAP economies have taken steps to incorporate poverty
reduction into their current overall national development plans
and policy documents. These plans include China's seven-year
poverty reduction plan, Mongolia's national poverty alleviation
program, the Philippines' Social Reform Agenda, Bangladesh's
pro-poor plan in its fifth five-year plan and the Maldives'
poverty alleviation program.
</P>
<P>
Most ESCAP economies have also established a national
inter-sectoral coordinating body to provide leadership in the
implementation of the Agenda for Action. They have tried very hard
to advocate poverty reduction policies and programs, enlist the
participation of non-government organizations and set up an
appropriate administrative and legislative framework for the
implementation of the programs.
</P>
<P>
There has also been an increase, though modest, in national
budgets for social development programs including poverty
alleviation.
</P>
<P>
However, the poverty situation in the region is still grave. To
speed up the implementation of the Agenda for Action, the
delegates decided to intensify efforts to speed up social
development in the region in the context of national situations.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to increase the level of resources for social
development, strengthen social protection programs for all
disadvantaged groups, and augment investment in human resource
development to ensure that the region's poor enter the next
century free from hunger, ill health, illiteracy, unemployment and
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also urged all members of the United Nations, and
other international and regional organizations including the Asian
Development Bank to provide more support for the social
development initiatives taken by the Asian and Pacific economies.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Blacks have headed 44 of
South Africa's 97 missions abroad, a foreign affairs spokesman
said in Pretoria today.
</P>
<P>
The number of blacks selected for foreign posts had also risen
from about two percent in 1994 to more than 48 percent this year,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Twelve of the blacks in charge of foreign missions were women.
another four missions were headed by white women.
</P>
<P>
"This indicates that the transformation process in the
(foreign affairs) department is well on track.
</P>
<P>
South Africa used to be a apartheid kingdom where blacks had
been discriminated against for hundreds of years. Thanks to
prolonged and arduous struggle waged by the black people in the
country and comprehensive support by the world people, South
Africa abolished apartheid system in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The black people account for 76 percent of population in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Blacks posted abroad are certainly not token appointments.
All of them undergo thorough training before taking up their
positions," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
About 50 new missions had been opened abroad since 1994, which
witnessed the first non-racial elections in South Africa.

NANCHANG, November 11 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangxi Province
has commenced construction of a new highway from Jiujiang, one of
the largest ports along the Yangtze River, to Jingdezhen, the
"ceramics capital of China".
</P>
<P>
The project is scheduled for completion early next century.
</P>
<P>
The project will use 150 million US dollar loans from the Asian
Development Bank. It is the largest of its kind in the province in
terms of the use of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Once completed, the highway will reduce the driving time from

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Suspends Talks With Leftists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government today
suspended peace talks with the leftist National Democratic Front
(NDF) due to the abduction of two military officers by NDF
fighters late last month.
</P>
<P>
Howard Dee, the chief government negotiator, said that the
peace talks will not be resumed until the NDF's military wing, the
New People's Army, releases the two abducted -- a police officer
and an army sergeant.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators from the two sides were supposed to begin their
meeting today in the Netherlands, where some NDF leaders are
living in exile, to discuss a substantive agenda for their future
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Dee said the public statements of the NDF indicated that the
group wanted to use the abduction to "strengthen its hand in its
negotiations" with the government.
</P>
<P>
The NDF was trying to use the incident to force the government
to "accept provisions in the Human Rights and International
Humanitarian Law Agreement" being discussed by the two sides, Dee
explained.
</P>
<P>
"The government is therefore compelled to discontinue the peace
talks and to uphold this principled position until the case has
been resolved," he added.
</P>
<P>
On October 30, a group of armed NPA members raided a police
station, abducting the two officers and killing one policeman.
</P>
<P>
The NDF, a leftist alliance created by the Communist Party of
the Philippines during the early 1970s, has fought the government
for more than two decades. According to military estimates, the
group currently has less than 10,000 fighters.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Moscow hopes to continue its
dialogue with the Baltic states and seek other forms of
cooperation that will meet interests related to regional security.
</P>
<P>
A Russian Ministry official, who declined to be identified, was
quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying today that Moscow's
negative attitude to admitting Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia into
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The official said the presidents of the three Baltic states,
by turning down the Russian security guarantees for the Baltic
countries, actually reiterated what they had stated earlier in
their countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "the Russian proposals are much more weighty and go
beyond the aspects to which the Baltic states have limited
themselves."
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the three Baltic countries rebuffed Russia's
proposal to offer them security guarantees on a bilateral or
multilateral basis at a meeting in the Lithuanian seaside town of
Palanga on November 10.
</P>
<P>
They said, in a joint communique, that the policy they
pursued was based on the principles of indivisibility of the
European security system and was aimed, above all, at the
integration of the European Union and NATO.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that such integration would strengthen European
security.
</P>
<P>
On October 24, Russian President Boris Yeltsin handed
Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas, who was on a state visit
in Moscow, a statement on Russia's readiness to provide the
Baltic states with a security guarantee.

</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's call came during a meeting with officials and trade
company representatives from both countries.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that Russia attaches great importance to trade and
economic ties with China. He noted that China is becoming one of
Russia's largest trade partners.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that trade and economic cooperation between the two
countries depends heavily on the border areas. He noted that border
trade serves as bridges and links in the comprehensive economic
cooperation between the two countries.

survey will ensure peace in the border areas, and will help
promote trade and economic development.
</P>

On the establishment of trade zones in the border areas, he
said that Russia plans to launch pilot projects in Amurskaya Obl
and Chitinskaya Obl. He said his government will introduce
flexible policies in trade zones.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that local Chinese and Russian
governments in the border areas will take measures to expand
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said Heilongjiang Province shares a 3,000-km border
with Russia and the two sides have a solid foundation for
cooperation in the construction of infrastructure and the
development of energy industry.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang Governor Tian Fengshan noted the great potential
for complementary border trade between China and Russia.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the two sides will establish trade
zones at the earliest possible date so as to promote border trade.
</P>
<P>
Tian said Heilongjiang is fully prepared to further develop
economic and technological cooperation with Russia.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the province has numerous outdated enterprises,
including 22 projects constructed with assistance from the former
Soviet Union. Tian stressed that all the projects are in dire need of
technological upgrading and welcomed the Russian enterprises
in related efforts.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- A European Union (EU)
official today appealed for protection for workers in all
excluded sectors against risks to their health and safety, reports
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
"There are workers in excluded sectors who have no protection
against risks to their health and safety although they have to
work excessively long hours," EU Employment and Social Affairs
Commissioner Padraig Flynn said in Luxembourg while addressing the
General Assembly of the Federation of Transport Unions.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner explained that the European Commission, the
EU's executive body, favored the introduction of framework
measures to extend full provisions of the Working Time
Directive to all non-mobile workers.
</P>
<P>
There would have to be suitable adjustments made to the
existing exceptions to take into account such things as the need
for continuity of service and other operational requirements, said
the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
These measures would also apply to certain provisions of the
Working Time Directive to all mobile and offshore workers, such as
four weeks' paid annual leave and health assessments for night
workers.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Commission also announced its intention to
introduce or amend specific legislation for each sector when it
came to working time and rest periods for mobile workers and
offshore workers.
</P>
<P>
"We intend to provide in particular new working time limits on
driving, loading, unloading and the like," Flynn said.

<HEADLINE> Fighting breaks Out in s. Somali Town, Killing 13 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Heavy fighting broke out
between the forces of Hussein Mohamed Aidid and those of the
Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA) in Huddor town of Bakol region in
southern Somalia Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
At least 13 people were killed and 17 others wounded when the
RRA guerrilla fighters pitted themselves against Hussein Aidid's
men in bitter fighting inside the town, reports reaching here
said today.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the militia commanders of Hussein Aidid said
the fighting lasted till the afternoon when the RRA men were
driven out of the town.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Aidid's militiamen said their forces had
killed eight of the Rahanwein men and wounded several others and
lost four men while nine others suffered gunshot wounds during
the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Aidid's men claimed that the town is now under their
control and situation there is stable.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, a RRA spokesman claimed that his forces
have killed 19 of Aidid's men and wounded 25 others, while they
lost nine of their men during the fighting which he said is still
continuing in a sporadic way.
</P>
<P>
According to Mr Mohamed Ali Aden Qalinle, his forces now
control part of the town, while Hussein Aidid's men control the
airport of Huddor.
</P>
<P>
However, there are no independent confirmations regarding the
opposing allegations. Nevertheless, nine wounded militiamen of
Hussein Aidid have been flown from Huddor to Mogadishu for
treatment on late Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Huddor, a town some 300 km southwest of Mogadishu is now
itself being besieged by floods. The main street linking the town
with Baidoa is also cut by the rain water and the only
communication is the use of those small Cesna planes that
transport the khat, medicine and other supplies to the town.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wins Race 3 at OOCL Yachting Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Australia's America's Cup
legend John Bertrand won the third day's race at the 1997 Oriental
Overseas Container Line Ltd. (OOCL) Etchells World Yachting
Championships here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bertrand, five-time veteran and one-time winner of the
America's Cup, took the lead at the second mark and never let it
go on the 12 mile, windward/leeward course. Bertrand has worked
steadily from third in Race 1 and second in Race 2 to take the top
place here today. He is now first overall after three races at
the world championships.
</P>
<P>
Australian sailmaker and ex-Dennis Connor crew, Michael Coxon,
also sailed a very steady race, maintaining second position almost
the entire way around. American Gary Gilbert sailed a great race
to take the third place.
</P>
<P>
"The race is close, very tight and very precise. The fleet is
strong, which shows up in the racing," said Bertrand after his
victory.
</P>
<P>
Early leader Noel Drennan, winner of Race 2 on Monday, fell to
second overall in the regatta with a devastating 15th place
today. However he will be able to discard one out of the six
races.
</P>
<P>
Starting in 19 knots of wind, other top sailors of the field
were Hong Kong's favorite Thornburrow in fourth, American Jeff
Madrigali in fifth, Australia's 1996 Olympic bronze medalist and
two-time Etchells world champion Colin Beashel in sixth, and
current world champion Adam Goslin from Britain, third in Race 2
on Monday, took the seventh place today.
</P>
<P>
Another unexpected finishers were American sailmaker Jud Smith
back in 10th and Denmark's two-time Olympic champion Poul-Richard
Hoj-Jensen in 12th. Smith and Hoj-Jensen are the 1996 OOCL Asia
Pacific champions.
</P>
<P>
The OOCL World Championships have attracted the world's best
Etchells sailors. 30 boats and 91 crew from six countries and
regions are competing from November 8-15 in this last leg of the
OOCL World Series. Skippers are competing for the OOCL World
Series Trophy, based on their accumulated points over the
three-year, four regatta series.

<HEADLINE> Williams, McLaren Cleared of Race Fixing Accusation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Williams and McLaren
Formula One teams were cleared on Tuesday of allegations that they
fixed the result of the European Grand Prix in Jerez, Spain, on
October 26.
</P>
<P>
The two teams were accused of colluding together in the year's
last stage to ensure that Williams' driver Jacques Villeneuve won
the 1997 world title.
</P>
<P>
Villeneuve, who led the drivers and was seemingly sure to take
the stage, appeared to allow the McLarens of Mika Hakkinen and
David Coulthard through on the last lap. A third finishing earned
the French-Canadian enough points to win the year's title.
</P>
<P>
It had been alleged that this was the reward for the McLaren
cars keeping out of the way of Villeneuve and title rival Michael
Schumacher during the race.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the International Automobile Federation (FIA) world
council Max Mosley said he was satisfied that there was no such
arrangement between the teams.
</P>
<P>
Mosley said: "The world council is quite satisfied that there
was no arrangement between Williams and McLaren to fix the
outcome."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Malaysia Reacts Strongly to Proposed U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The announcement by
Washington that a U.S. official will visit Malaysia soon to probe
into a Malaysian company's business dealings in Iran has aroused
strong reaction here.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. made its intentions known two days ago,
Malaysian cabinet ministers have voiced strong opposition to
Washington's stance, saying that efforts to prevent the Malaysian
firm -- Petronas from investing in another country were tantamount
to undermining Malaysia's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim today told the
House of Representatives that the U.S. has no right to question
Petronas or any other Malaysian companies' entitlement to trade
world-wide.
</P>
<P>
"It is illogical. The U.S. has no right to question Petronas or
other Malaysian companies' rights to invest or do business with
whichever country," Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, said in
response to a question on whether the government would table a
Parliamentary motion on the U.S.' impending investigations into
Petronas' involvement in an oil joint venture in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Petronas, together with Total, a French energy company, and
Gazprom of Russia, Bow Valley of Canada and the Bakrie Group of
Indonesia, have announced plans to invest 2 billion U.S. dollars
to develop the Iranian gas industry, which Washington says defies
U.S. sanctions legislation.
</P>
<P>
Under the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act passed by U.S. Congress last
year, the U.S. President is required to impose sanctions on any
foreign company investing more than 20 million U.S. dollars in
the energy industries of Iran and Libya.
</P>
<P>
The companies are exposed to the risks of a trade embargo
placed by the U.S. if investigations showed that their business
operations had violated the Act.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah
Aziz, who confirmed the visit of the U.S. investigator to Kuala
Lumpur next week, said today her country strongly opposes the
principles of the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act because it is an
application of a domestic law outside the borders of a country.
</P>
<P>
It is clear that the Sanctions Act is a U.S. domestic law and
"as such, it should not be applied outside its borders on third or
other countries or preventing companies in other countries from
taking action," she said after officiating a seminar here.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah said it was not just Malaysia which opposed the
sanctions but a majority, if not all, of the trading nations in
the world.
</P>
<P>
Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Abang Abu Bakar
Mustapha today described the U.S. action as that of a bully
wanting to wield its power over smaller countries like Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Malaysia's investment in Iran was in line
with the policy of the World Trade Organization (WTO) which
permits all countries to have trade links with each other.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the threat by the U.S. to impose
sanctions on countries dealing with Iran, Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said today his country will not stop U.S.
officials from probing into Petronas' involvement in the oil
exploration project in Iran.
</P>
<P>
But Mahathir said: "We want to know what questions the United
States would pose to Petronas...and we would give reasonable
answers."
</P>
<P>
"If they (the U.S.) want to stop us, we can't accept
that...they must also stop the French and the Russians," Mahathir
said.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, soon after Washington's announcement, Malaysian
Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmed Badawi said Malaysia would not bow
down to threats from other governments to follow instructions
given unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia would not cut ties with any country due to pressure
from a third country, he said.

<HEADLINE> Macao to Pay All Public Debts Before 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Macao government will pay
back all public debts before 1999, a senior budgetary official
said.
</P>
<P>
Jose Alarcao Troni, secretary for social affairs and budget,
told the Macao Daily News that the government will pay back all
the 400 million patacas (about 50.6 million U.S. dollars) of
indirect debts before the handover of power in 1999. It has no
direct debt.
</P>
<P>
The government undertook the debts as a guarantor of the Macao
International Airport Company.
</P>
<P>
"The debt will be paid back completely before the handover of
power in 1999 so that the future Macao Special Administrative
Region will have no debt, whether direct or indirect," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said the budget for 1998 will be made in a
balanced, stable and self-sufficient principle.
</P>
<P>
The government earlier said the budgeted expenditure for 1998
will reach 10.7 billion patacas (about 1.35 billion dollars).
Among the planned cost, 1.8 billion patacas (227.8 million
dollars) will go to education and culture, 1.4 billion (177.2
million dollars) to the public health and social affairs, 1.2
billion (151.9 million dollars) to security and 1.9 billion (240.5

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: HK Economists Argue for Keeping Pegged Exchange Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Economists in Hong Kong are
arguing for maintaining the pegged exchange rate system in the
wake of the speculative attacks on the local currency, saying
devaluation is not the way out and would not boost
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong must not abandon the currency peg. If it did, it
threw in the sponge," Prof. Y. C. Jao at the School of Economics
and Finance, University of Hong Kong, told Xinhua in an interview.
</P>
<P>
International speculators, who had triggered the falling
dominoes in Southeast Asian currencies, mounted an attack on the
Hong Kong dollar late October, the second round in less than three
months.
</P>
<P>
Fears of the delinking of the peg pushed up interbank lending
rates to record highs and sent the stock market into a steep
plunge. A long shadow has been cast over the interest-rate
sensitive banking and property, the two heavyweight players in
Hong Kong's economy.
</P>
<P>
"But the Hong Kong dollar remains stable, and in this sense,
the speculators have been routed. The sharp fall of stock and
property prices is the price Hong Kong has to pay," said Prof.
Jao, who also sits on an advisory committee of the Exchange Fund,
in which Hong Kong's foreign reserves are vested.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong currency was pegged to the U.S. dollar on October
17, 1983 at around 7.8 HK dollars for one US dollar, an
arrangement made to save Hong Kong from the financial crisis in
the early 1980's.
</P>
<P>
The currency board system requires that the issuing of every
7.8 Hong Kong dollars be fully backed by one US dollar, and it
also has built-in, self-stabilizing mechanisms to weather
turbulence in the market.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Jao summed up: "The link has performed well over the past
14 years to give exchange rate stability in Hong Kong. Its merits
outweigh its demerits, and I see no reason why we should abandon
it."
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region and other Hong Kong officials have made
strong commitments to defend the linked exchange rate system,
sending a clear message to the market that the peg must stay.
</P>
<P>
Kwok Chuen Kwok, Standard Chartered Bank's chief economist,
said Hong Kong has learned the lessons of the besieged Southeast
Asian countries. These countries eventually gave up the defense of
fixed exchange rates to let their currencies float and devaluate,
but found that the move did not bring the results they had
expected.
</P>
<P>
"Their currencies devaluated further, but interest rates went
up, giving another blow to the economy and the confidence," Kwok
told Xinhua in an interview.
</P>
<P>
"Speculators are not so powerful, but they are good at
exploiting psychological factors, such as fears of bubbles in the
economy. In this way, they could lead investors to follow them and
exert a powerful influence on the market," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is Hong Kong depositors, not speculators, who will
determine the ultimate fate of the peg," said Kwok, "The peg will
stand firm so long as Hong Kong people have confidence in their
own currency, in the government's will and ability to defend the
exchange rate link, and in the economic outlook of Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
It is widely acknowledged that the fundamentals of Hong Kong's
economy are strong despite the high level of wages and property
prices. The GDP growth is at about five percent, the unemployment
rate is at 2.2 percent, and the unoccupied property rate is only
at four percent.
</P>
<P>
But there are worries about the competitiveness because of the
high cost of business in Hong Kong, especially at a time when
Southeast Asian economies devaluated their currencies.
</P>
<P>
Dr Chan Wai-Kwan, assistant director of the Hong Kong General
Chamber of Commerce, said a devalued currency would not boost
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
"Devaluation for its own sake is not competitiveness," he said
"In reality, one finds that the stronger economies are the ones
with stronger, not weaker, currencies. Therefore, the real
question is how strong Hong Kong's economy is."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that competitiveness relies on real gains in
efficiency and productivity, and on sufficient investment in
technology and education in the long run.
</P>
<P>
A special report by Vickers Ballas Hong Kong Ltd. says that
Hong Kong's competitiveness has more to do with the diversity and
vibrancy of its service sector, which accounts for more than 80
percent of Hong Kong's GDP.
</P>
<P>
But the report addressed the imbalance in Hong Kong's property
sector, saying that property prices need to adjust to maintain the
long-term growth path of the economy.

<HEADLINE> HK Fund Industry Registers Net Inflows in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's unit trust
industry recorded net sales of 136.24 million U.S. dollars in
September despite the market volatility in the region, according
to the Hong Kong Investment Funds Association (HKIFA).
</P>
<P>
Unit trust gross sales were at 430.85 million U.S. dollars in
September, compared with a subdued level of redemption of 294.61
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In analyzing the month's sales figures, Peter Lord, chairman of
the association, said, "Despite the volatility in the regional
stock and currency markets in September, redemptions were not
heavy and in fact, net inflows almost reached 32 percent of gross
sales."
</P>
<P>
The key contributors to net inflows in September were the Hong
Kong equity and Single Asian countries (excluding HK and Japan)
sectors, attracting new money of 52.41 million U.S. dollars and
37.06 million U.S. dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, the other Asian-related sectors all witnessed
redemptions. The one that suffered the heaviest redemptions was
the regional (excluding Japan, including HK) sector, with net
outflows of 24.85 million U.S. dollars, while net outflows for the
remaining sectors were relatively mild.
</P>
<P>
As to why the Hong Kong and single Asian countries sectors
managed to maintain much resilience in the market declines, Lord
said, "There has been much fund flows into and out of these two
sectors."
</P>
<P>
"While there were some investors who wished to withdraw funds
in the market turbulence, other investors viewed this as an
opportunity to buy stocks in selective markets at lower prices."
</P>
<P>
As for sales in October, Lord noted, "In view of the plunge of
the Hong Kong stock market in October and its reverberations on
other markets, it would not come as a surprise if the fund
industry faced net redemptions."
</P>
<P>
The HKIFA consists of 45 fund companies as full members, and 35
professional firms, which include trustees, accountants and
lawyers as associate members.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Buying Nuclear Equipment From Austria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran has denied a report that
it purchased nuclear equipment from Austria for its nuclear power
plant through a Russian company, the official news agency IRNA
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Deputy director at Iran's Atomic Energy Organization (AEO),
Asadollah Sabouri, said that the equipment claimed to have been
purchased from Austria can under no circumstances be used for
Iran's Bushehr atomic power plant near the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Sabouri said that AEO officials have no information on the
reported deal, according to IRNA.
</P>
<P>
The German publication Die Stern in its recent issue claimed
that an Austrian company intended to sell parts of the
Zwentendorf Atomic Power Plant to a Russian company, which plans
to use these parts for the completion of the Bushehr Atomic Power
Plant in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Michael Machura, head of the Austrian company, I.D.P.C., also
denied the report, saying that the equipment and machineries for
the Zwentendorf Atomic Power Plant is not compatible with the
Bushehr plant.
</P>
<P>
He said the main equipment from the Zwentendorf power plant,
including its main generator and other major parts, have been
purchased by Germany and only parts like the valves and other
minor accessories remained.
</P>
<P>
The Russian company will use the purchased parts to perform
repair and renovation operations on its own atomic power plants,
he added.
</P>
<P>
IRNA quoted Hans Blix, head of the International Atomic Energy
Association (IAEA), as saying in Vienna that the fuel rods of the
Zwentendorf plant were sold 10 years ago under IAEA supervision in
accordance with international regulations and at present there are
no sensitive components at the plant which require supervision by
IAEA.
</P>
<P>
The Zwentendorf Atomic Power Plant was built with a price tag
of about 1 billion U.S. dollars) but was not put into operation
due to opposition from a majority of Austrians in a referendum in
1978.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leaders Attend Meeting of Scientists, Skilled Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Scientists should use their
theoretical and practical knowledge to help workers improve their
skills, according to Wei Jianxing, Standing Committee member of
the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Wei, who is also member of the Secretariat of the CPC
Central Committee and president of the All-China Federation of
Trade Unions (ACFTU), made the remarks here today during a meeting
between scientists and skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was a major event during China's International Week
for Science and Peace.
</P>
<P>
Wei noted that the 15th National Congress of the CPC
set a goal of advancing the cause of building a socialism
with Chinese characteristics. He noted that achieving the goal
will require a large number of scientists and hundreds of
thousands of skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
He called on scientists to exhibit greater concern about the
scientific and technological activities of the workers throughout
China.
</P>
<P>
Wei expressed his hope that scientists and skilled workers will
learn each other and contribute greatly to the implementation of
the CPC Central Committee's strategy of using science and
technology to rejuvenate the country.
</P>
<P>
Wang Guangying, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, and He Luli, vice-chairwoman of

<HEADLINE> Commentary: New Motive Force for Developing Sino-Russian Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin's third visit to China, the fifth Sino-Russian summit and
the issuance of the fifth Sino-Russian Joint Statement will not
only effectively accelerate the comprehensive development of the
strategic coordinative partnership between the two nations, but
will also have a positive impact on the post-Cold War security
structure and relations between major powers.
</P>
<P>
President Yeltsin concluded his three-day state visit to China
and departed Harbin for Russia late this afternoon. Yeltsin
visited Beijing where he held talks with Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and met with other Chinese leaders, including Premier Li
Peng and Qiao Shi, chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Summit talks between Yeltsin and Jiang yielded an extensive
acknowledgement of the need to strengthen existing bilateral
relations and for consulting and coordinating activities related
to major international issues.
</P>
<P>
The fifth Sino-Russian Joint Statement declares that the two
nations have successfully settled demarcation of the eastern
section of their common border. Yeltsin also visited northeast
China's Heilongjiang Province where he met with officials in
border areas, as well as local Chinese and Russian residents and
enterprise managers.
</P>
<P>
Settlement of the border issue will undoubtedly help to
maintain peace, tranquility, stability and development in the
border areas, and will also provide a fine example of how to
settle similar historical issues.
</P>
<P>
The fifth Joint Statement also includes specific provisions on
how to expand exchanges and cooperation in wide-ranging areas,
including economic and trade ties, developing energy resources,
environmental protection, basic scientific and high-tech research,
culture and military technology.
</P>
<P>
The statement will serve as a reliable guarantee for
accelerating advancement of the strategic partnership between the
two countries. The two presidents showed full confidence that the
total Sino-Russian trade volume will rise to 20 billion
U.S. dollars by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of Sino-Russian relations since 1992 has
been based on shared political views and a solid social and
economic base featuring the traditional friendship between the two
peoples and their common interests, as well as their common task
of striving for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Russian relations have witnessed three stages of
development over the past six years: the two countries recognized
each other as friendly neighbors in 1992 following Yeltsin's first
China visit; the constructive strategic partnership was initiated
in 1994 when Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited Moscow; and,
finally, Yeltsin's second visit to China in 1996 resulted in the
two countries vowing to establish a constructive strategic
partnership oriented to the 21st century and based on nonalliance,
nonconfrontation and not targeting third parties.
</P>
<P>
Jiang visited Moscow in April this year and the two leaders
issued their fourth Joint Statement leading to the effective
realization of the strategic partnership featuring equality,
mutual trust and mutually beneficial cooperation for common
development.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's latest China visit will undoubtedly provide a new
motive force for elevating the Sino-Russian relationship to a new
plateau.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Iraq again barred Americans
from entering an inspection site today, thus turning away U.N.
weapons inspection teams for the eighth day in a row.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Iraq News Agency, five
surveillance-and-verification groups of the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) on dismantling Iraq's mass destruction weapons
in Baghdad left their bases Wednesday morning for a number of
Iraqi sites they wanted to inspect.
</P>
<P>
One of the five groups arrived at a site where the Iraqis told
the group members that they would be allowed to get into the site
without American arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. team did not accept the condition and decided to
return to their base. The other four teams then decided to follow
suit.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has threatened to use force against Iraq unless Iraq
give up its October 29 decision to expel Americans from the
UNSCOM arms inspection teams.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iraq Again Turns Back US Arms Inspectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Iraq again barred Americans
from entering an inspection site today, thus turning away U.N.
weapons inspection teams for the eighth day in a row.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Iraq News Agency, five
surveillance-and-verification groups of the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) on dismantling Iraq's mass destruction weapons
in Baghdad left their bases Tuesday morning for a number of
Iraqi sites they wanted to inspect.
</P>
<P>
One of the five groups arrived at a site where the Iraqis told
the group members that they would be allowed to get into the site
without American arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. team did not accept the condition and decided to
return to their base. The other four teams then decided to follow
suit.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has threatened to use force against Iraq unless Iraq
give up its October 29 decision to expel Americans from the
UNSCOM arms inspection teams.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iraq refused to back down but said it was not
seeking a crisis with the U.N. and the UNSCOM.

<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Shen Guofang said here today that China is fully
prepared to consult with all the parties concerned on the issue of
proportional shares of annual United Nations dues.
</P>
<P>
Shen made the remarks at a press conference when
asked whether China and the US have reached an agreement on the
proportional shares of the UN dues.
</P>
<P>
The question came in response to the arrival of a deputy
assistant secretary of state of the US, who is visiting China to
discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
Shen said the issue concerns the interests of all the UN member
states and thus should be settled by UN resolutions through
discussions and consultations between all the member nations.
</P>
<P>
He said related issues cannot be settled by a single country or
even a few countries.
</P>
<P>
He stressed it is not a bilateral issue between China and the
US, and therefore the two countries cannot reach a binding
agreement on the issue.

LONDON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Former world champion Michael
Schumacher escaped a ban after appearing before an International

England on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But the German had his second place in the 1997 World

<HEADLINE> ARATS on Cross-Straits Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing-based Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) has expressed
regret over the fact that the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) will not send its secretary-general to a seminar
scheduled to be held on China's mainland next month.
</P>
<P>
ARATS announced that it had received a letter stating that
Chiao Jen Ho, vice-chairman and secretary-general of the SEF will
not lead a delegation from Taiwan to the "Seminar on Economic
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits Beyond the Century" and will
not visit Xiamen, Shanghai and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
An ARATS spokesman said his organization has invited
businessmen and scholars from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan to
attend the forthcoming seminar.
</P>
<P>
ARATS has also invited leading SEF officials to attend the
seminar's opening ceremony, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He noted that ARATS regrets SEF's decision, and noted that
leaders of the two organizations will miss an excellent
opportunity to exchange views.
</P>
<P>
SEF proposed that Board Chairman Koo Chen-Fu lead a delegation
to visit the aforementioned cities. The ARATS spokesman said his
organization welcomes Koo to visit China's mainland at an
appropriate time.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that any future visit by Koo will be actually
related to talks with ARATS President Wang Daohan.
</P>
<P>
He said that ARATS is anticipating talks with SEF in order to
arrange procedures for political talks across the straits.
</P>
<P>
He noted that leaders of the two sides should first exchange
views on issues of mutual concern in order to make proper
arrangements for Koo's visit to China's mainland.

<HEADLINE> Australian Aboriginal Groups Pull Out of Health Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- A total of 100 Aboriginal
health services across Australia today decided to pull out of a
national health policy body to protest against a decision by the
federal health minister to close down an aboriginal health service
in Queensland.
</P>
<P>
The services, members of the National Aboriginal Community
Controlled Health Organization (NACCHO), voted unanimously to
withdraw from the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
Health Council at their annual conference at the Gold Coast.
</P>
<P>
In his statement issued today, NACCHO Chairman Puggy Hunter
described as disgusting and contemptuous a decision by federal
Health Minister Michael Wooldridge to close down the North Coast
Aboriginal Health Service in Queensland against the council's
advice.
</P>
<P>
"As a consequence of the minister's choice to ignore this
advice, NACCHO withdraws from further participation in (the
council) and its sub-committees," Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawing services said the government was "treacherous"
and obstructing their work.
</P>
<P>
"Our relationship with the federal government has collapsed -
we have lost patience," Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
"This government has been quite treacherous. Funds that should
have gone to Aboriginal health services have been siphoned off and
handed to state governments and other non-Aboriginal bodies."
</P>
<P>
Australia's some 300,000 aborigines were reported to be at the
most disadvantaged position in the society, with life expectancy
between 15-17 years less than that of the total population and
infant mortality three times higher than the average. Many
aboriginal communities lived without quality water, electricity
and waste disposal facilities, according to earlier reports.

JERUSALEM, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Palestinians
today held rallies in Gaza and the West Bank town of Ramallah to
show their solidarity with the Iraqi people, Jerusalem Media and
Communication Center (JMCC) reported.
</P>
<P>
Waving Iraqi flags and shouting slogans against the United
States, the demonstrators called on Arab nations to form a united
front against the U.S. and give their support to the Iraqi people
in this time of need.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian protesters in Gaza staged a sit-in demonstration
in front of the United Nations Representative Office to rally
support for the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The participants of both rallies, which went on peacefully,
strongly condemned the U.S. aggressive position toward the Iraqi
people and its biased stands on the Middle East peace process,
said the JMCC.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians believed that the Iraqi crisis is not caused by
Iraq's expulsion order of American arms inspectors, but due to
U.S. aggressive policies to destroy the whole of Iraq, the JMCC
quoted rally organizers as saying.
</P>
<P>
Iraq decided on October 29 to expel U.S. weapons inspectors
working with the U.N. Special Commission for dismantling Iraq's
mass destructive weapons, triggering a confrontation with the

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian military
officer today voiced Iran's readiness to hold joint exercises with
Gulf Arab states, the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Commander of Iran's navy Abbas Mohtaj said that cooperation on
a common defense scheme with the southern littoral states of the
Gulf was a matter of doctrine for Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said that peace and stability in the strategic Gulf would be
restored by the regional states on the basis of common interests
and reliance on their defense capability.
</P>
<P>
Mohtaj said the "Victory 8" war games staged by the Iranian
navy in the Gulf last month had a message of brotherhood and
cooperation on a common defense scheme with the Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recent call by the Kuwaiti Defense Minister
Sheikh Salem Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah to hold a joint naval
exercise with Iran, he said that Iran's defense policy was based
on cooperation with all Islamic states, particularly the Gulf
states.
</P>
<P>
"We regard the call... as a response to Iran's friendly
initiatives on forming a new security arrangement in the Persian
Gulf without presence of any external forces," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani Saturday also expressed
Iran's readiness to hold joint naval exercises with Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He said that launching joint maneuvers with Gulf states was
essential for the peace and security in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Iran has launched a series of diplomatic initiatives to improve
relations with Gulf states in an effort to break the West-imposed
isolation. Iran's Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi is currently on
a "confidence-building" trip starting from Sunday to the six Gulf

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein
Karbaschi was barred from travelling abroad after he was charged
of involving in some embezzlements by district mayors, local
evening daily Resalat reported today.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi was summoned again to a court in Tehran to offer
explanations about the charges against him.
</P>
<P>
The court judge issued an order to bar Karbaschi from
traveling abroad and released him from the court on bail of 5
billion rials (about 1.67 million U.S. dollars), the report said.
</P>
<P>
Several district mayors of Tehran city and some assistants of
the Tehran mayor were arrested for involving in embezzlement
cases and it was believed that Karbaschi also was involved in
some cases.
</P>
<P>
The case of the Tehran mayor has caused sharp political
struggles among rival factions. The hardline conservatives urged
to punish Karbaschi while the moderates said the case was aimed at
weakening the executive branch of the country.
</P>
<P>
"The sensational allegations leveled at the mayor are not
related to him and stem from the defeat of a certain faction in
the presidential election," said Behzad Nabavi, former minister
of Heavy Industries and a strong supporter of President Mohammad
Khatami.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the defeated rival factions are influential in
government institutions except in the executive branch, so
naturally they plan to gradually discredit and undermine this
branch of the government to the extent that it could not
implement its plans and objectives."

Ahemd Tejan Kabbah by April next year.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, ECOMOG and Koroma's men had met twice
at the ECOMOG base near Freetown since the Conakary agreement,
and had agreed to hold further talks on a 15-point agenda, five
of which were suggested by Koroma.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the talks said the top issue forwarded by
Koroma is the release from detention in Nigeria of Foday Sankoh,
leader of the Revolutionary United Front, a former rebel group
that has become the ally of Koroma after the May 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are also expected to discuss the embargo on
Sierra Leone initiated by the Economic Community of West African
States and later adopted by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG insists that the embargo will remain until the handover
in April next year, but Koroma demands that it be lifted right
now.
</P>
<P>
Other topics on the agenda include exchange of prisoners
during the clashes between ECOMOG and Koroma's troops in the last
few months, and the setting up of a monitoring group to supervise
the handover process.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Drafts Enterprises Development Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian government
has drafted a micro and small enterprises development strategy.
</P>
<P>
This was announced today by Ethiopian Vice-minister of Trade
and Industry Brook Debebe at a meeting held at the United Nations
Conference Center here.
</P>
<P>
Brook said the strategy aims at solving the generic problems
in the country such as access to finance, encouraging
partnership, training in entrepreneurship skills and management,
as well as access to appropriate technology, the physical
infrastructure and institutional strengthening.
</P>
<P>
He said the reason for the drafting of the strategy are
problems faced by medium and large industries and that the
available government resource can have an impact only on targeted
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector of the country contributes to 11
percent of the nation's gross domestic products, according to the
vice-minister.

<HEADLINE> Women Are Prime Suffers of Natural Degradation: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A study carried out by
the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA)
revealed that natural resource degradation precipitated by the
ever increasing population explosion has more adverse
consequences on women than men.
</P>
<P>
"Women are the forefront victims of poverty which is the major
outcome of natural and environmental degradation," the study
said.
</P>
<P>
It said "women, particularly in developing countries, are
compelled to produce food grain on barren lands heavily leached
by several natural calamities."
</P>
<P>
They are also forced to trek longer distances in search of
safe drinking water and fuel wood as nearby forests and springs
have already been drained and depleted, the study said.
</P>
<P>
It is mostly women's duty to look after members of a family at
times of epidemics and other natural disasters, the study noted.
</P>
<P>
The impacts of natural degradation are further aggravated by
the fact that women are deprived of their rights to get access to
decision making activities, educational opportunities and land
ownership, the study pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Empowerment of women, raising their role in natural resources
protection activities, and ensuring their right to get access to
various social services could alleviate women's problem which is
worsened by natural degradation, the study added.

<HEADLINE> US Envoy Visits Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Presidential Emissary
for Cyprus Richard Holbrooke arrived here this evening for
meetings with leaders of the two communities on Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for Holbrooke to visit Cyprus after his
appointment by U.S. President Bill Clinton last June.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after his arrival Holbrooke had a meeting with
President Glafcos Clerides. He then crossed into the
Turkish-controlled northern part of Nicosia to meet Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Holbrooke is expected to have a joint meeting with
Clerides and Denktash at the Ledra Palace Hotel, situated in the
U.N.-controlled buffer zone of the capital.
</P>
<P>
It would be the first face-to-face meeting between Clerides and
Denktash in the presence of the U.S. envoy.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department Spokesman James Rubins stated last week
that the meeting would be informal and there would be no specific
agenda.
</P>
<P>
Clerides has said Holbrooke's visit signals the start of a
U.S. initiative in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke is accompanied by State Department Special
Coordinator for Cyprus Thomas Miller, who arrived here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Miller, who had separate meetings with Clerides and Denktash
today, said that he is trying to make progress toward a Cyprus
settlement.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus problem has remained unresolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkey landed its troops and took over
the northern third part following a short-lived coup by some
Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.

LUANDA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government said
here today that it is urgently needed to remove existing
obstacles in the Angolan peace process for the realization of
final peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued today to mark the 22nd anniversary of
its indepandence which falls on tomorrow, the Angolan government
said that the implementation of the Lusaka peace agreement has
entered a crucial state at present.
</P>
<P>
It noted, however, that free flow of people and goods all over
the country has not been achieved and for lack of necessary
conditions, the country cannot devote itself to reconstruction
and development.
</P>
<P>
Under such a circumstance, a spirit of brotherhood and mutual
aid should be developed among the Angolans, the Angolan
government said.
</P>
<P>
In the statement entitled "To Consolidate Peace and National
Reconciliation", the Angolan government reiterated that it will
continue to seek "a quick and realistic solution" to step up
national development and improve the people's living standards.
</P>
<P>
The government called on all Angolans to reflect on the peace
process in order to achieveational unity and reconciliation as
soon as possible.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Electoral Commission
Chairman Zacchaeua Chesoni today indicated that he would announce
polling day only after the first stage of six weeks starting from
today was completed.
</P>
<P>
Chesoni made the remarks at a press conference here following

</P>
<P>
During the first stage, he noted, the speaker of parliament

able to announce the deadline for nomination of party candidates,
which takes a minimum 21 days.
</P>
<P>
The polling day must be announced a minimum of 14 days after
all nominations are sent in, he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the forthcoming General Election would be the
first held under a Code Conduct passed into law last week.
</P>
<P>
"Violence is now outlawed, destroying of campaign materials
like posters of other candidates is now outlawed," he stated.

<HEADLINE> Kaunda to Continue Lobbying for Stopping Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Zambian former president, now
leader of the opposition United National Independence Party
(UNIP), Kenneth Kaunda said today that he will continue to lobby
for a stop to international economic aid to the Zambian
government.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda made the statement in London in an interview with CNN.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Richard Sakala, Zambia's presidential aide for
press and public relations, rapped Kaunda here today, saying that
the UNIP leader has no care for Zambians by calling for a
continued international economic squeeze on Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Some western countries suspended their financial aid to Zambia
in 1996 in protest against a constitutional amendment bill, which
in fact barred Kaunda from contesting the presidency in the
elections held in November of the year because of Kaunda's
parents are Malawian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
After the elections the west resumed aid to the country, but
Zambian opposition parties have been urging the western countries
to keep their squeeze on the government to pressure it into
dialogue with the opposition parities.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Non-State-Run Economy Grows Stronger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's non-state-run
businesses have increased to more than 65,000, 27 times the number
just five years ago.
</P>
<P>
The city's non-state-run business sector now ranks first in
China in terms of the number, registered capital, employees and
the number of company-scale businesses, which account for 80
percent of the city's individually owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics also show that 73 percent of Shanghai's
non-state-run firms are in the service industry, with 2,000
technology-related businesses, twice the country's average.
</P>
<P>
At present, its average registered capital posts 600,000 yuan,
20 percent higher than the country's average.
</P>
<P>
In recent years the sector has emerged as an important source
of re-employing laid-off workers and idle labor forces. Shanghai's
non-state-run businesses hired 80,000 people in the first half of
this year. Up to then, the sector has hired about 100,000 of the
city's laid-off workers and 300,000 spare laborers from the
countryside in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
In addition, this sector plays an indispensable role in
commodity circulation. Currently, its businesses have secured 7
percent of the city's retail market, with the annual sales topping
8 billion yuan (963 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Shanghai now gets 30 percent of its revenue from the
non-state-run sector. Last year, it collected 1.2 billion yuan
(144 million U.S. dollars) from the sector, a 47-fold increase
over 1992.
</P>
<P>
The remarkable growth of the city's non-state-run sector could
partly be attributed to their diversified fund-raising channels.
Some 1,700 businesses have been co-invested with state-owned and
collectively owned enterprises, and more than 100 private
companies have been founded with investment from overseas.
</P>
<P>
In the next phase, the sector is aiming at large-scale
operations. So far, Shanghai has four conglomerates tied to
individual enterprenuers. The non-state-run businesses with
registered capital of more than 10 million yuan account for 26 and
those with more than 5 million yuan account for 400.
</P>
<P>
Economists forecast that the city's non-state-run businesses
will amount to 80,000, with their total industrial value exceeding
34.3 billion yuan and retail sales hitting 36.3 billion yuan by
the end of this century.

CHANGCHUN, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The three provinces in
northeast China, the country's leading grain producers, have
recorded good grain harvests despite an extended severe drought.
</P>
<P>
The three provinces, including Heilongjiang, Jilin and

billion kilograms.

<P>
Heilongjiang, China's northernmost province, witnessed a
record-high yield of 31 billion kg., with Jilin setting an

agriculture.

BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- China's commodity market will
maintain a steady growth momentum in the fourth quarter of this
year, according to predictions made by the Chinese Ministry of
Internal Trade.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Commodity Circulation Department of the
ministry predicted that China's commodity retail sales will post
2.38 trillion yuan (286.7 billion U.S. dollars) this year,
increasing by 12 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, prices of the country's major
commodities will report an overall decrease, compared to the same
period of last year. The officials said the rising margin of
China's retail price will be controlled to under two percent this
year.
</P>

The market of industrial products for daily use is expected to
remain stable in the last three months of this year, with only the
sales of clothing to show increase by a bigger margin.
</P>

As for non-staple food, the production of pork, which ranks
first in China's meat consumption, will register a notable climb,
with an estimated 65.4 million hogs to be slaughtered in the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
The ministry forecast China's sugar output in the 1997-1998
period would stand at from 7 to 7.2 million tons, which may result
in a sagging sugar price next year.

<P>
In addition, China will have an ample vegetable supply this

BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Shen Guofang said that the US House of Representatives,
in disregard of international law and basic norms governing
international relations, has passed recently a series of bills
with anti-China contents and grossly interfered in China's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
"We hereby express our firm opposition and strong displeasure,"
said Shen when asked to comment on this issue here this afternoon
at a routine press conference.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that it should be pointed out that there are always
some people in the US Congress who are uncomfortable with better
Sino-American relations and closer friendly exchanges between the
two peoples.
</P>
<P>
"Every time the relationship gets better, they will go out of
their way to make trouble and erect obstacles. Yet history has
proved, and will continue to prove the futility of their
attempts," added Shen.

<P>
SHANGHAI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Watching movies in a theatre
is still the most popular entertainment for most Chinese citizens,
a recent survey conducted in five cities has concluded.
</P>
<P>
The Horizon Market Survey and Analysis Company, a
non-governmental Beijing-based research company, randomly surveyed
1,524 Chinese citizens in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xiamen and
Chongqing, and found that 46.9 percent of those questioned regard
going to the movies as their favorite form of entertainment. The
figure is 12 percent higher than for those who prefer watching TV.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile less than 10 percent of those surveyed say they often
watch movies, which shows that the market status of Chinese-made
movies is not flourishing, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Most of those who do not like watching domestic movies choose
more convenient and simpler forms of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese have long criticized the relatively high ticket
price and low quality of Chinese-made movies.

JOHANNESBURG, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Britain has promised to
use its presidency of the European Union (EU) in the first half
of next year to help South Africa reach trade agreement with the
EU, local Business Report said today.
</P>
<P>
Visiting British Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food

Cunningham said in a press briefing that he had urged Erwin to
keep up the pressure on the EU by putting a definite proposal on
the table during the Britain's presidency between January and

<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The following is the full text
of the Sino-Russian Joint Statement signed by Chinese President
Jiang Zemin and Russian President Boris Yeltsin during the
latter's state visit to China:
</P>
<P>
SINO-RUSSIAN JOINT STATEMENT
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin of the People's Republic of China and
President Boris Yeltsin of the Russian Federation held their fifth
summit in Beijing on November 10, 1997. The two leaders held
detailed discussions concerning the present situation and the
prospects for bilateral relations and major international
issues. The meeting was a resounding success with the two
presidents reaching a broad consensus on related matters.
</P>
<P>
 I
</P>
<P>
The positive actions China and Russia have taken to build a
multipolar world, and a new and comparatively perfected
international political and economic order have received
widespread acknowledgement from the international community, and
have exerted a healthy influence on the international situation as
the turn of the century approaches.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will continue to develop friendly relations and
cooperation between China and Russia and consider such relations
as an important component to ensure the security, stability and
economic prosperity of Eurasia and the Pacific
Region. Sino-Russian relations are in no way targeted against any
third country and the two countries do not seek hegemony, nor
expansion.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are extremely satisfied to point out that
relations between China, Russia, the United States and Japan
witnessed positive development during the recent summit meetings
between the nations. China and Russia believe that the time when
countries forged alliances and engaged in strategic integration
targeted against a third country has passed. All countries,
especially major powers, should comply with the development trend
towards world multipolarization, develop relations based on the
principle of mutual respect, equality, being beneficial to all
parties and taking into consideration of the interests of all
parties. So doing will be of vital importance for ensuring world
peace and development. The two sides are determined to work to
reach this end.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia believe that in the new century, mutual trust,
cooperation on an equal footing and coherence of diversification
between nations will guarantee peace and prosperity for
mankind. Concerted efforts are indispensable for establishing
inseparable global, regional and sub-regional security patterns
which are oriented to the 21st century and ensure the equality of
all parties.

<HEADLINE> Full Text of Sino-Russian Joint Statement (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The heads of state of China and Russia solemnly declare that
all points of contention regarding surveying and demarcating the
eastern section of the Sino-Russian border have been resolved
according to the agreement signed on May 16, 1991. The demarcated
eastern section of the Sino-Russia border, which stretches some
4,200 kilometers, has been accurately marked for the first time in
the history of Sino-Russian bilateral relations. This constitutes
the major achievement of the fifth summit between the two nations
and was the direct result of joint efforts, mutual respect and
consideration of each other's interests.
</P>
<P>
The two sides declare that they will complete demarcation of
the western section (about 55 kilometers) of the Sino-Russian
border within the agreed period of time. They will also continue
to negotiate for reaching fair and reasonable solutions to a few
remaining border problems in order to define their entire common
border.
</P>
<P>
The smooth demarcation of the Sino-Russian border represents a
model for resolving problems left over by history in a fair and
reasonable manner and in the spirit of consultations based on an
equal footing, mutual understanding and concessions. The
achievement will contribute greatly to peace, tranquillity,
stability and prosperity in border areas of China and Russia, as
well as to regional stability and the enhancement of friendship
and good-neighborly relations between the two countries. It also
accords with the common aspirations of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
III
</P>
<P>
The two sides highly value the important role of the four
previous joint statements signed by the Chinese and Russian heads
of state in actively propelling bilateral relations and in
effecting the establishment of a strategic cooperative partnership
based on equality and trust and oriented to the 21st century. The
two sides reiterate that the principles laid down in the previous
four joint statements are of immediate significance and are of
particular significance in the following aspects:
</P>
<P>
1. Strengthening trust, mutual respect, equality and mutual
benefit, and noninterference in each other's internal affairs. The
two sides agree that it is imperative to draw on the experiences
and lessons of history, strictly abide by the objectives and
principles of the United Nations Charter and universally
acknowledged norms of international law, and exhibit mutual
respect for the road to development chosen by the people in each
other country. The two sides respect and understand the efforts
made by each other country to safeguard national unity,
sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence.
</P>
<P>
2. Mechanisms for exchange visits by heads of state, for
regular meetings between premiers and consultations between
foreign ministers are conducive to enhancing mutual communication
and understanding, as well as to expanding and deepening
comprehensive cooperation between the two nations in various
fields.
</P>
<P>
3. Reinforcing coordination concerning major international
issues in order to allow the two sides to engage in joint efforts
to safeguard world peace and promote international cooperation and
development.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Needs $26 Billion to Raise Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government will
need to invest 15 billion U.S. dollars in its effort to increase
the country's oil production capacity to three million barrels
per day by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The investment is only part of the estimated 26 billion
dollars and represents the government's 57 percent equity
interest in the joint venture operations, according to Felix
Imoukhuede, Chairman of the Society of Petroleum Engineers
Nigerian Council.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government hopes to substantially increase the
country's production capacity up from the present 2.24 million
barrels per day to back up its demand for a higher production
quota in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which
now stands at 1.865 million.
</P>
<P>
According to Imoukhuede, the application of new technologies
to oil drilling could help improve the nation's proven reserves
to over 40 billion barrels, up from 25 billion now.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is currently the largest oil producing and exporting
country in Africa. More than 80 percent of the foreign exchange
it needs comes from oil exports.

<HEADLINE> Ceiling Mosaics Discovered in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Construction workers in
Shanghai discovered a group of ceiling mosaics when renovating an
old Western-style building used by the Shanghai-Hong Kong Bank
early this century.
</P>
<P>
The colorful mosaics, made of tens of thousands of pieces of
porcelain, were made by several Italian artists in 1923 and cover
200 square meters on the lobby ceiling.
</P>
<P>
They have been covered by plaster since 1949, when Shanghai was
liberated and the building was used for offices of the Shanghai
municipal government, according to experts on cultural relics
protection in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The pictures depict fairy tales and landscapes of Shanghai,
Hong Kong, London, Paris, New York, Tokyo, Bangkok and Calcutta in
the early years of this century.
</P>
<P>
The experts said the plaster has done little damage to the
mosaics. In fact, it protected them during the Cultural Revolution
(1966-76) period, when many works of art with so-called
"feudalistic and colonial characteristics" were distroyed.
</P>
<P>
Workers with the Shanghai Decoration Corporation, which is in
charge of renovating the building, are repairing parts of the
mosaics which had been stripped off.
</P>
<P>
The building, currently housing the headquarters of the
Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, is located in the Shanghai Bund,
where many Western-style banking buildings converged before new
China was born in 1949. At that time Shanghai served as far east
Asia's financial center.
</P>
<P>
Many domestic and overseas financial institutions have taken
over a number of the buildings from governmental departments over
the past two years, as part of the plan to make Shanghai as an
important financial center in Asia again.

6. The development of ties in the area of military technology
is an important component of bilateral cooperation. In this
regard, the two sides strictly abide by the United Nations Charter
and respective international obligations in order to help
safeguard security and stability in the region and in the world as
a whole. Sino-Russian cooperation in the field of military
technology is in no way directed against a third country.
</P>
<P>
7. Expanding personnel exchanges and contacts in the cultural
and educational areas is of great significance for strengthening
friendship and mutual understanding between the Chinese and
Russian people.

joint prevention of cross-border pollution and rational and

<HEADLINE> 91 Guns Lost or Stolen Every Day in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 11 (Xinhua) -- An average of 91 guns
were reported lost or stolen across South Africa every day in the
first 10 months of the year, Safety and Security Minister Sydney
Mufamadi told parliament Monday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the firearms used in the 25,783 robberies and 2,026
attempted robberies reported in the first six months of the year
were stolen from the country's estimated 3.4 million legal gun
owners, The Star newspaper today quoted Mufamadi as saying.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, 5,127 murders and 10,050 attempted
murders involving firearms were reported, Mufamadi said in
response to a question by a member of parliament from the African
National Congress.
</P>
<P>
About 6,000 people were arrested for illegal possession of
firearms during the period, he said.
</P>
<P>
Central Firearms Register (CFR) commander Abrie Burger said
Monday that many guns were lost due to negligence on the part of
licensed owners.
</P>
<P>
"The majority of firearms are lost in the toilet or during
visits to shebeens," Burger said.
</P>
<P>
CFR statistics show that more than 12,000 of the 50,585
firearms reported stolen or lost since last year, or some 23.7
percent, were police-owned weapons.
</P>
<P>
National Police Commissioner George Fivaz made the recovery of
illegal firearms the police service's top priority in his 1997-98
Police Plan, which was announced in April this year.
</P>
<P>
Tougher legislation and control of firearms is on the way
through stricter sentences for possession of illegal weapons and
stricter criteria for the ownership of firearms.
</P>
<P>
A firearms task force set up by a parliamentary subcommittee
has presented a national firearm plan to the cabinet, which
include longer jail terms for illegal possession of firearms,
competency testing for all firearm-license applicants, among
other measures.

KUALA LUMPUR, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Anthony Hill
was banned on Tuesday for two months from the beginning of
December after testing positive for marijuana at a league match in
France last May.
</P>
<P>
The Professional Squash Association said the 28-year-old
Melbourne-based player was also fined 200 pounds (340
U.S. dollars) for the drug offence.
</P>
<P>
The fine brings Hill within 100 pounds of a 1,000 pound
one-year cumulative fines total that would automatically trigger a
12 month ban from the world tour.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mark Toh, the tournament director at the world
championships here, might report Hill over an alleged incident in
which he is said to have loudly abused hotel staff and taxi
drivers in a row over transport.

<P>
PARIS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The congress of European People's Party, a pan-European party
allying central-right parties from Europe including the
Democratic-Christian Union of Germany and Union for French Democracy
of France, ended on Monday in the southern French city of Toulouse.
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Luxembourg Prime Minister
Jean-Claude Juncker expressed satisfaction over the congress which
launched a crusade for jobs in Europe.
</P>
<P>
-- The British Labor Party is winning support from employers of
Britain, who are more and more irritated by the Eurosceptic attitude
of the Tories. British Chancellor of Exchequer Gordon Brown won a
big success at the congress of the Confederation of British
Industry, the union of British employers, in Birmingham by
explaining that one should now prepare for the European monetary
system in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- While the British Defense Minister George Robertson has warned
Iraq that a military action is not excluded, Baghdad is maintaining
its arms wrestling with Washington and has affirmed its will to
retaliate against the overflight of U2 spy plane over its
territory. The United States President Bill Clinton is expecting the
U.N. Security Council to adopt a "very firm" resolution against
Iraq for its banning of Americans from the U.N. mission on
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
-- The French government presented on Monday a draft law aimed
at "cleaning up" the trucking industry by introducing reform to
the profession, as was promised by the government to striking lorry
drivers during their blockade of France's roads last week. The law
will allow the government to punish law-breaking trucking employers
by freezing their vehicles. A round-table meeting will be organized
by the government on November 20 to be attended by government
officials, employers and workers.

<HEADLINE> TV Documentary on Mystery of Monsters at Tianchi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, November 11 (Xinhua) -- A TV documentary delving
into the mystery of the monsters at Tianchi in the Changbai
Mountains has been completed and shown in the city of Yanji, Jilin
Province.
</P>
<P>
The 40-minute program was filmed jointly over the past two
years by the Jilin Society of the Monsters at Tianchi in the
Changbai Mountains and Huichun Municipal TV Station.
</P>
<P>
Chai Jingguo, chairman of the Jilin Society of the Monsters at
Tianchi in the Changbai Mountains, said that the documentary will
help to solve one of the great mysteries of the world.
</P>
<P>
Tianchi, occupying 10 square kilometers with a depth of 373
meters, is a crater lake on the top of the Changbai Mountains
which border China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
For years people have been fascinated by the possible existence
of creatures in the lake.
</P>
<P>
Although many people still deny they're there, records from the
early part of this century show that thousands of mountain
climbers claim to have seen them.
</P>
<P>
The documentary is based in part on interviews with the
eyewitnesses who say that the monsters are for real.
</P>
<P>
It also includes photos and videotape footage which purportedly
show the lake monsters. This film was all shot from a mountain top
over 1,000 meters high above the lake, and the creatures can only
be identified as black spots.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses say the monsters come in many different shapes and
sizes. Some said that they resemble dinosaurs; others said they're
more like buffalo. Some said that they have round black heads and
others said that their necks are elongated.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 of the photos used in the documentary are from
Zhou Wenjie, a professor of the Physics Department of Jilin
University, who took them on July 24, 1994.
</P>
<P>
A key eyewitness, Zhou Wenying, who works for the Jilin
Meteorological Department, said that he has seen the creatures
seven or eight times, noting that he once saw seven of the
monsters in two different shapes.
</P>
<P>
The program also includes the opposition to the possibility of
lake monsters offered by geologists and biologists.
</P>
<P>
Chai Jingguo said that the TV documentary is the result of the
efforts to uncover the monster mystery.
</P>
<P>
Chai, who published a book about the subject, has visited
Tianchi a dozen times. In 1995, he set up a monster observation
station at Tianchi.

</P>
<P>
The International Ski Federation (FIS) is demanding the start
of the downhill course be raised to extend the run. Nagano
organisers counter that such a move would encroach into a national
park.

After a meeting behind closed doors here between NAOC, the Ski
Association of Japan and Japanese Olympic Committee, Saito said
the committee would be headed by Japanese Olympic Committee
chairman Hironoshin Furuhashi.

<HEADLINE> Bengal Tigers in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Extensive research has revealed
that the Tibet Autonomous Regions is currently home to over 30
Bengal Tigers.
</P>
<P>
The species is under Class-1 state protection and has been
listed as one of the world's most endangered species.
</P>
<P>
The number of Bengal tigers in Tibet fell to as low as 10
between 1987-1991, with most found in Meto and Zayu counties, the
region's main natural habitats for the animal.
</P>
<P>
However, the latest research on wildlife resources revealed
that the number of tigers in Zayu County remained stable, with the
number found in Meto County rising dramatically to over 20.
</P>
<P>
The region opened a state nature reserve in Meto County in
early 1961 to protect the species, with a regional nature reserve
established in Zayu County in 1985. The region's forestry
department also introduced regulations governing the protection of
wildlife, with clear stipulations outlining punishment for those
involved in poaching activities related to tigers.
</P>
<P>
The sharp increase in the number of tigers in Tibet also
indicates that tigers from neighboring countries and districts
have migrated into the region due to environmental deterioration
in their former habitats, according to Wildlife Expert Liu Wulin.
</P>
<P>
Tigers, known to be at the end of food chain, breed once every
three years, and the survival rate for the species is quite low,
according to Liu.
</P>
<P>
Local residents in Meto, home to the vast majority of Bengal
Tigers, complain that the tigers attack livestock and even
people. The local government has spent thousands of yuan to drive
tigers out of residential areas and ensure the safety of both
people and livestock.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- More than four million Chinese
citizens gained literacy in 1996, according to the latest
statistics disclosed at the Anti-Illiteracy Working Conference held
here this morning.
</P>
<P>
The conference was sponsored by the Coordinating Committee for
China's Anti-Illiteracy Campaign.
</P>
<P>
China has recorded great progress in eliminating illiteracy,
with some 60 million Chinese people, including 25 million
youngsters and 35 million adults, gaining literacy during the
Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995).
</P>
<P>
The literacy rate for young people jumped from 89.62 percent
to 93.86 percent during the period, with the figure for adults
rising from 79.79 percent to 83.16 percent.
</P>
<P>
The goal for eliminating illiteracy calls for raising the
literacy rate for young people to 98 percent.
</P>
<P>
Some 145 million Chinese people are still classified as
illiterate, with the figure including 37.5 million youngsters, or
approximately 25 percent of the total. Females living in
poverty-stricken and mountainous areas account for the vast
majority of the illiterate population.

<P>
MOSCOW, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Uzbekistan wants to have good
relations with the United States but "it is by no means directed
against Russia," Uzbek President Islam Karimov said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Russian newspaper Izvestia published
Tuesday, Karimov said "we are no iceberg to drift. We have a ship,
there is a rudder and sail. They are controllable."
</P>
<P>
He said this in response to accusation of "drifting aside."
</P>
<P>
The Uzbek president is sure that his country has not lost
interest in Russia. "Uzbeks cannot be torn away from the Russian
people, Russian culture, Russian civilization, Russian history,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to economic relations with Russia, Karimov said
Uzbekistan wants to trade with its northern neighbor not through
barter but as with a civilized country which has hard currency.
</P>
<P>
Karimov emphasized that Uzbekistan is not putting forward
"ambitious tasks or joining the Group-7, or Group-8 or anything
else." "We are patiently building our own potential," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about development of state patterns, the president said
"Uzbekistan follows the Uzbek pattern," that is "to restore
everything great in the ancient culture of our ancestors, combine
the great legacy with the achievements of world civilization and
use enormous natural and intellectual resources."

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A Pakistani man was
convicted today of killing two Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
employees in a 1993 shooting spree outside the agency's
headquarters and could receive the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
A 12-member Fairfax County jury deliberated for four hours
before finding Mir Aimal Kasi guilty of one count of capital
murder, another count of first-degree murder and three counts of
malicious wounding.
</P>
<P>
The penalty phase was to begin on Tuesday morning, Fairfax
Circuit Court Judge J. Howe Brown announced. The 33-year Kasi,
captured in June in Pakistan by the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI), could face death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Kasi was found guilty of shooting to death Frank Darling, a
28-year-old covert operative for the CIA, and Lansing Bennett, a
66-year-old physician and intelligence analyst. He was also
convicted of wounding two other CIA workers and an employee of a
CIA contractor.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani walked amid stopped cars in morning rush-hour
traffic outside the CIA compound on January 25, 1993, firing at
people inside them with an AK-47 assault rifle, the prosecutors
said.
</P>
<P>
During the trial, prosecutors said Kasi was out to avenge
American bombing of Iraq during the Persian Gulf War and American
meddling in Muslim nations of the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Alatas: Cambodian Politicians' Safety Can Be Guaranteed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 10 (xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister
Ali Alatas said here today that Cambodia's pro-Ranariddh
politicians could go home without having to worry about
intimidation or court threats.
</P>
<P>
The minister considered their return to Cambodia very important
in creating a conducive atmosphere for the implementation of a
fair and just general elections in Cambodia scheduled for May next
year.
</P>
<P>
"Thus the ASEAN troika consisting of the foreign ministers of
Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines will keep on trying to
facilitate the return of these Cambodian politicians to enable
them to prepare for the general elections," he said.
</P>
<P>
A number of Cambodian politicians particularly the supporters
of Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who fled abroad after Ranariddh was
ousted by Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, are afraid of their
safety for returning.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said Ranariddh's return remains a problem as Hun Sen
threatened to take him to court for alledged illegal importing
weapons.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), which groups
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Laos, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, suspended the scheduled admission
of Cambodia after its recent political crisis.

<HEADLINE> Britain Reaffirms Tough Stance Towards Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary
George Robertson reaffirmed here today Britain's tough stance
towards Iraq, saying Baghdad's banning of American arms inspectors
was "a step too far."
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government has decided to ban American experts from
taking part in an arms inspection team of the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) on Iraq, accusing them of undertaking spy
activities on behalf of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Robertson told reporters early today that Britain's Labor
government would ensure that "the world community's view is
delivered to Saddam Hussein in the toughest and most robust way
that is possible."
</P>
<P>
"I think he (Saddam Hussein) realises now in Baghdad that the
world community is united. This was a step too far and UNSCOM
inspectors must be allowed to do their job unhindered by his
intransigence," he said.
</P>
<P>
The British Defense Secretary, who refused to rule out the
possibility of using military means to resolve the current crisis,
said: "We are not talking about any of the options we are
considering."
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair Sunday pledged his support
for the United States in its row with Iraq over the UN arms
inspection in Iraq.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. President Decides to Shelve "Fast-Track" Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives put off the decisive vote over "fast-track" trade
bill at the request of President Bill Clinton, a major political
defeat for the White House this year.
</P>
<P>
Due to lack of support from his own party, Clinton told House
Speaker Newt Gingrich in a telephone call this morning to drop
efforts to pass the so-called "fast track" bill. It means that
there will be another difficult battle for the legislation next
year.
</P>
<P>
The decision came after the House stayed in session past
midnight in an unsuccessful attempt to gather enough votes.
</P>
<P>
"The president will be committed to opening markets overseas
using whatever tools are available to him," stated White House
spokesman Mike McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
House GOP leaders said the president was informed late Sunday
night that he was about a half-dozen votes short of winning, but
that they gave him the final say on whether to "pull" the bill.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time over the past week Clinton had requested
a delay.
</P>
<P>
Critics, including labor unions and environmental groups, argue
it does not do enough to require presidents to consider wages,
working conditions and environmental standards when dealing with
the U.S. overseas trading partners.
</P>
<P>
Most Republicans and corporate America support the measure.
</P>
<P>
The "fast-track" authority allows Congress to simply approve or
reject trade agreements negotiated by the administration, but not
amend them. The administration wanted the power to accelerated the
procedures for a proposed free-trade pact with Chile, and to enter
into other new trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Presidents, for decades, have had the authority, but it
has lapsed.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Senate Vote on Civil Rights Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Monday appealed to the full Senate to vote on the nomination of
Bill Lann Lee to head the Justice Department's civil rights
division.
</P>
<P>
With Lee alongside him at a White House conference on hate
crimes, Clinton said the Senate Judiciary Committee should not
kill Lee's nomination as assistant attorney general for civil
rights because he supports affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
"It is wrong to deny this man that job because he agrees with
the policies of his president on that issue," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"With all respect, if we have to wait until we get a head of
the civil rights division who is opposed to affirmative action,
that job will be vacant for a very long time," he said.
</P>
<P>
Senator Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee
and a Republican, said on Sunday that as far as right now Lee's
nomination is dead. Clinton asked that Hatch send the nomination
forward for a vote anyway, without a committee recommendation.
</P>
<P>
"Let all 100 senators stand up and be counted in the full view
of the American people," Clinton said at the conference.
</P>
<P>
Hatch rejected a request by committee Democrats for another
hearing so that Lee could answer charges that he has been an
advocate of racial and gender preferences.
</P>
<P>
Democrats on the Judiciary Committee last week sought the
further hearing and postponement of the vote on Lee when it became
apparent it would turn out 9-9. Tie votes count as a rejection.
</P>
<P>
Senator Patrick Leahy, a ranking Democrat on the Judiciary
Committee, accused Republicans of using Lee for political
purposes.
</P>
<P>
Republican leaders are out to please extremists in their party
who oppose relief when equal opportunity is denied to women or
minorities in the workplace, he said.

<HEADLINE> Significant Ceremonial Site Discovered in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- British archaeologists have
discovered evidence of a prehistoric ceremonial temple at least as
"old and significant" as Stonehenge, a stone monument built by
ancient Britons.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the ruins, thought to be 5,000 years old, was
described by English Heritage officials today as the most exciting
archaeological find in Britain for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Traces of the temple -- in well defined pits within a 135-meter
circular ditch -- were found after archaeologists used sensitive
ground-scanning instruments below an ancient site of Stone Circles
at Stanton Drew near the southwestern English port of Bristol, an
official at English Heritage said.
</P>
<P>
"(The find) is as old and comparable in significance to the
megalith monument at Stonehenge, although twice its size," an
official statement reported.
</P>
<P>
Officials said until now the site had been concealed by a
series of well-known stone circles.
</P>
<P>
Sir Jocelyn Stevens, chairman of English Heritage, the
government department responsible for preserving historic sites,
told a news conference he thought the complex structure was built
as a "symbol of power" by people seeking to control the
supernatural.
</P>
<P>
Geoffrey Wainwright, English Heritage's chief archaeologist,
said they have about 3,000 stone circles in Britain but previously
only seven timber temples. The Stanton Drew find is by far the
largest, twice as big as anything previously discovered.
</P>
<P>
Wainwright said that the timber temples were probably
constructed around 3,000 BC, pre-dating stone circles, such as
Stonehenge, which began around 2,500BC.

<HEADLINE> Baltic States Refuse Russia's Security Guarantee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 10 (Xinhua) -- At the meeting in Palanga,
Lithuani, the presidents of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia Monday
rebuffed security guarantees offered by Russia to the Baltic
states, according to the Interfax news service.
</P>
<P>
A trilateral communique said the policy of the three states is
based on the idea of the indivisibility of the European security
system and is therefore directed primarily at integration into the
European Union and NATO.
</P>
<P>
Such integration, in opinion of the presidents of the Baltic
states, should sufficiently strengthen security in Europe."The
invariable goal of our states is a strive to integrate into NATO
and the European Union", the document said.
</P>
<P>
However, the leaders of the Baltic states appreciated the
Russia's willingness expressed by president Boris Yeltsin to
expand neighborly relations and mutually beneficial cooperation
with Baltic states.
</P>
<P>
They were satisfied with Moscow's readiness to continue a
political dialogue with Tallinn, Vilnius and Riga on a bilateral
basis and within the framework of various international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that Baltic leaders welcomed the signing of
the Russian-Lithuanian border treaty, and the leaders of Estonia
and Latvia voiced readiness to sign similar treaties with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin offered the Baltic states
security guarantees in a statement handed to Lithuanian President
Algirdas Brazauskas on October 24 when he was visiting Moscow.
Later similar offers were sent to the leaders of Estonia and
Latvia.

<HEADLINE> Blair Pledges to Make Britain Pivot of New World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair pledged here today to make Britain not only a leader in
Europe but also "the pivot of this new world".
</P>
<P>
Speaking in his first major foreign policy speech since winning
the May election, Blair set out his vision of a new Britain and
vowed to increase the country's influence in the world.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot in these post-Empire days be a super-power in the
military sense. But we can make the British presence in the world
felt," he told the annual banquet given by the Lord Mayor of
London.
</P>
<P>
"With our historic alliances, we can be pivotal. We can be
powerful in our influence -- a nation to whom others listen," he
said, adding "It is my belief that far from being standing alone,
Britain can be the pivot of this new world."
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the "guiding light" of the new Labor government,
Blair stressed the following four pinciples: The first was to
restore Britain's leading position in Europe, the second was to
forge strong links with the United States, the third was to
maintain a strong defense capacity and the fourth was to place
emphasis on ethics, human rights and free trade.
</P>
<P>
On the single European currency, Blair, whose government has
ruled out Britain's first-wave membership of the euro, said that
Britain had to prepare now for the single currency ahead of entry
in the next parliament.
</P>
<P>
"A successful single currency would be good for the Europe. But
it will affect us in or out," he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Drastically Cut Military Jobs for Weaponry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen announced today a drastic plan to cut 25 percent of
the military civilian jobs and make business reforms to save 3.2
billion U.S. dollars a year for new weaponry.
</P>
<P>
At a Pentagon press conference with Vice President Al Gore,
Cohen also called on Congress to approve two new rounds of
domestic base closings in 2001 and 2005 to save another 2.8
billion dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders explained that recent cuts in defense spending
and the government's moves to balance the federal budget simply
did not leave enough money for the nation's arms modernization.
</P>
<P>
Under the personnel cuts and business reforms, the Pentagon
will cut 28,000 out of 141,000 civilian jobs in targeted defense
organizations in the next four years.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said he would reduce one-third of his own 3,000-member
office staff worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Among the groups affected in the cuts would be the secretariats
for policy, acquisition, finance, personnel and intelligence, as
well as agencies responsible for commissaries, security, financial
accounting and information services.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 120,000 civilian defense jobs would also be put up
for bids between private agencies and the government under the
plan.
</P>
<P>
The initiatives are part of an ongoing reassessment of defense
manpower and resources that began last spring with the Quadrennial
Defense Review. The QDR recommended modest cuts in military forces
and preserved all major arms procurement programs.
</P>
<P>
In the business reform, the Pentagon will vastly increase its
use of computers and the Internet, using "electronic catalogues"
for purchasing and seeking achievement within three years of
entirely paper-free contracting for all major weapon systems.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon will also streamline travel planning and household
goods transportation for military and civilian employees to save
an estimated 300 million dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Gore and Cohen conceded that it would be difficult to get
Congressional approval of the base closures, but Defense officials
said that virtually all of the other moves would be accomplished
without Congressional approval.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Home Prices Rise 5 Percent Nationally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. home sale prices
climbed up by 5 percent in the year ended in September, much
faster than inflation, with a handful of cities in the South and
Midwest reporting double-digit increases over the past year.
</P>
<P>
The nation-wide the median price of an existing home increased
5 percent over the year to 126,500 dollars, the National
Association of Realtors said today. Meanwhile, consumer prices
overall rose just 2.2 percent over that period.
</P>
<P>
Of 136 metropolitan areas surveyed by the association, only 13
reported declines. And three of the nation's four broad regions
reported price appreciation even greater than the national
average.
</P>
<P>
In the South, the median price rose 6.9 percent to 112,300
dollars; in the Midwest, 5.5 percent to 108,100 dollars; in the
West, 5.2 percent to 163,000 dollars, and in the Northeast, 3.4
percent to 147,400 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Waterloo of Iowa state, led the nation in price appreciation,
with values jumping 17.2 percent. It was followed by Kalamazoo,
Michigan, 14.5 percent; New Orleans and Fort Lauderdale, Florida,
both 11.3 percent, and Memphis, Tennessee, 11.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Norfolk, Virginia, had the sharpest decline, 11.9 percent. It
was followed by Honolulu, 6 percent; Beaumont, Texas, 4.4 percent;
El Paso, Texas, and Hartford, Connecticut, both 3.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The five metro areas with the highest median prices in the
July-September quarter were Honolulu, 315,000 dollars; San
Francisco, 300,600 dollars; Orange County, California, 233,000
dollars; New York, 212,500 dollars, and Boston, 204,400 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The five with the lowest prices were Ocala, Florida., 65,700
dollars; Beaumont, Texas, 67,100 dollars; Waterloo, Iowa, 68,200
dollars; Davenport, Iowa, 71,700 dollars, and Daytona Beach,
Florida, 73,600 dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
ended higher Monday, supported by Asian markets' only moderate
losses and Wall Street's early gains.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index managed to close the day above the
4,800-point level at 4,806.8, up 42.5 points after drifting during
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that calmer Asian markets and Wall Street's
moderate rally helped underpin market sentiment.
</P>
<P>
However, with the South Korean market still volatile, investors
remained cautious. Meanwhile, they were nervous ahead of this
Wednesday's US Federal Reserve's monetary meeting.
</P>
<P>
German shares in Frankfurt also ended sharply higher, with the
DAX-30 index up 52.64 points at 3,752.53, boosted by the firmer
dollar which is favorable for German exporters and by hopes that
Asian markets are starting to stabilise.
</P>
<P>
But dealers said that market sentiment remained fragile and
trading volumes were thin.
</P>
<P>
French markets are closed Monday and Tuesday for the Armistice
holiday.

<HEADLINE> UK Labor to Hand Back F1 Chief's Donation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain's ruling Labor party
said today it would return a controversial donation from chief of
Formula One motor racing Bernie Ecclestone.
</P>
<P>
The party's general secretary Tom Sawyer told reporters a
donation from Ecclestone, president of the Formula One
Constructors Association, would be paid back.
</P>
<P>
He said the move was taken after consulting with Sir Patrick
Neill, Britain's official watchdog on political ethics.
</P>
<P>
Sir Patrick, chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public
Life, told Labor it would be wrong and unfair to criticize
Ecclestone's donation -- whose scale remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
But he recommended that in order to avoid even the appearance
of influence-peddling the money should be given back.
</P>
<P>
Although Ecclestone said he had never sought any favors from
the party or the government, question has been asked about links
between Labor and Formula One over the decision not to ban tobacco
advertisement.
</P>
<P>
Last week Tessa Jowell, a junior health minister, said the
pledge to ban Formula One tobacco sponsorship had been dropped as
a matter of "practical politics" because of the risk that the
sport might move out of Europe to the Far East.
</P>
<P>
Most Formula One teams are based in Britain, and Finance
Minister Gordon Brown said today their activities provided 50,000
jobs.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco advertisers, who are barred from using television
directly in most of Europe, see Formula One as a vital way of
reaching a worldwide television audience.
</P>
<P>
Anti-smoking groups condemned the move and the European
Commission said it was disappointed, but cigarette manufacturers,
who pump an estimated 100 million pounds (170 million U.S.
dollars) into Formula One each year, praised the announcement.

NEW YORK, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street
retreated from an early rally and fell modestly today, with the
Dow Jones industrial average dropping 28.73 points to 7,552.59.

<P>
The Dow surrendered an opening 75-point gain. It was the third

<HEADLINE> US: U-2 Flies Safely Over Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Pentagon officials said
today that a U.S. U-2 spy plane flew over central Iraq on orders
from the United Nations earlier this morning without incident.
</P>
<P>
The officials said other U.S. jets watched protectively from
no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq but did not escort the
high-flying U-2 over central Iraq. The Iraqis did not try to shoot
down the spy plane as previously threatened, they said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was reported to say that a spy plane had crossed its
border from Saudi Arabia but was out of range of anti-aircraft
missiles.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Asks U.N. to Tighten Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Monday that it would seek a strong resolution against Iraq to
press Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to reverse his decision on
U.N. weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
"We will be seeking a strong resolution... a resolution that
will condemn his actions, demand that he reverse course and take
up where the security council left off," State Department
spokesman James Rubin said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
The strong resolution against Iraq includes restrictions of
Iraqi officials to travel beyond their country, which were
considered several weeks ago, but were rejected in the Security
Council, Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had been
contacting her Russian and French counterparts Yevgeny Primakov
and Herbert Vedrine, whose countries opposed the travel
restrictions resolution in the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
He would not disclose the results of her contacts but said
the secretary of state felt "quite good."
</P>
<P>
"We are going to see a greater support in the Council for the
kind of ratcheted-up pressure that such a resolution would
entail," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the United States had not ruled out any options --
including military action -- but "the first order of business is
this kind of resolution" to tighten travel restrictions on Iraqi
officials.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the White House said President Bill Clinton wanted
the U.N. Security Council to issue an "unambiguous and strong
statement" on resuming weapons inspections, which have been
suspended for a week during talks between U.N. envoys and Iraqi
officials over Iraq's refusal to allow Americans in U.N. weapons
inspection teams to enter the country.
</P>
<P>
President made it clear that "the next step is to get a very
strong resolution from the United Nations manifesting the
determination of the international community to resume those
inspections."
</P>
<P>
He was said to be "satisfied" with a U-2 spy plane to resume
its flight, on orders from the United Nations, early this morning
over Iraq without any incident.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore expressed hope that diplomatic
pressure still might force Saddam Hussein to reverse his
exclusion of Americans from U.N. weapons inspection teams.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to hope that the discussions will result in
Saddam Hussein deciding that he has to change his behavior," he
said at a Pentagon news conference.
</P>
<P>
As regards to U-2 flights over Iraq, Gore said the spy plane
would continue to fly for U.N. inspections and Iraq had no right
to challenge their flights.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to an Iraqi letter to the United Nations,
which said it did not recognize the U-2 flights as part of the
U.N. program.
</P>
<P>
"It is not for Iraq to decide whether it recognizes what
forces make up the U.N. inspection effort," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to continue activities such as the U-2 flights,"
he said. "We're going to insist... that Iraq observe the United
Nations resolutions in every particular."
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen confirmed at the same news
conference that a U-2 spy plane mission over central Iraq was
completed without direct threats from Iraqi forces.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said it was important that the Security Council insists
there be "no exceptions, no negotiations" with Iraq on complying
with U.N. resolutions that authorize weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Bill Richardson said in
an interview with CNN that Washington wanted to see the Security
Council agree on a "resolution with teeth, with punitive
measure ... to stop Saddam playing games."
</P>
<P>
Richardson complained that the United Nations gave attention
to Iraqi Foreign Minister Tareq Aziz's arrival in New York and
his talks with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, saying "it's
just more delay and denial."
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why everyone is giving this visit so much
attention ... We dno't expect much to come of it," he said.

<HEADLINE> UN Seeks 17.7 Mln Dlr Emergency Aid to Republic of Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations today
launched the Consolidated Inter-Agency Flash Appeal for the
Republic of Congo, requesting 17.7 million US dollars to meet the
priority needs of 650,000 internally-displaced people for an
initial period of three months.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued here today by the UN
Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA), the infrastructure in
the Republic of Congo is in ruins and casualties are estimated at
well over 5,000 and there have been massive displacements of urban
populations to rural areas following five months of armed
conflict.
</P>
<P>
The capital city of Brazzaville was emptied of practically all
of its population, who sought refuge in the southern districts, in
Pointe-Noire, as well as in villages in the north and south of the
country, the DHA said.
</P>
<P>
The UN appeal will address the needs of families who have been
displaced as well as those residing in the capital. The priority
will be given to the provision of food and nutrition, shelter,
basic health care, water and sanitation as well as limited
distribution of seeds and tools to assist internally displaced
persons and host families to restore and improve food security
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Particular attention will be given to single-parent families,
female-headed households, unaccompanied children and those
traumatized by the armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
The international community is calling upon donors to respond
generously and without delay to this appeal which should
facilitate the return of the displaced to their communities of
origin, the DHA said.

UNITED NATIONS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The offices of the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) were cooperating on the
transfer of agriculture equipment from the Republic of Korea (ROK)
to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), UNDP releases
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The equipment, intended to help bolster DPRK's agriculture
sector, includes earth-moving machinery and transport and support
vehicles, which will cross the sea route of the Demilitarized
Zone, from Inchon in ROK to Nampo in DPRK.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first real cooperation between North and South
Korea through UNDP on sustainable activities in the agriculture
sector. We hope that UNDP in Pyongyang and UNDP in Seoul will be
able to foster more of this type of collaboration in the future,"
said UNDP Resident Representative Christian Lemaire in Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
The shipment will be used to strengthen UNDP's Agricultural
Rehabilitation Program in DPRK. Drought and tidal waves have
wiped out much of the country's harvest this year, and are
responsible for destroying 70 percent of its maize crop.

WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton was
satisfied with the flight of a U-2 spy plane over Central Iraq
this morning without incident, the White House said today.
</P>
<P>
"The president is satisfied that the mission went forward,"
White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters.
</P>
<P>
According to Pentagon officials, the U-2 was watched carefully
by other U.S. jets from "no-fly" zones in northern and southern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqis were said to have found the spy plane crossed its
border from Saudi Arabia, but did not try to shoot as they had
previously warned. They said the spy plane was out of range of
anti-aircraft missiles.
</P>
<P>
The U-2 spy planes resumed their flights today on orders from
the United Nations after more than one week's delay because of
talks between U.N. envoys and Iraqi officials over a dispute, in
which the Iraqis refused Americans in U.N. arms inspection teams
to enter their country.
</P>

McCurry said President Clinton now wanted the U.N. Security

<HEADLINE> UK Government Backs Tougher Press Code </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
signaled support for further tightening of the newspaper
industry's code of conduct which was agreed by editors following
the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, said local press reports
today.
</P>
<P>
Culture and Media Secretary Chris Smith was quoted as saying
that despite the voluntary strengthening of the code of conduct by
the industry in the wake of Diana's death in August, there was
still room for improvement.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his commitment to the principle of
self-regulation and emphasized his distaste for privacy
legislation.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that newspapers could agree among themselves to
dispatch just one photographer and reporter on sensitive
assignments, and to share any resulting story or picture.
</P>
<P>
Smith said that in order to spare victims of crime the distress
of being bombarded by media attention, the industry's code of
conduct should include formal arrangements for newspapers to
interview them on a pooled basis.
</P>
<P>
He added that although the question of compensation for victims
of media harassment was complex, the Press Complaints Commission
should include it in its discussions on how to further improve its
code of conduct.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Convenes Conference on Hate Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- With hate crimes increasing
in the country, U.S. President Bill Clinton Monday called for
tougher laws to include all hate crimes that cause physical harm.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the White House Conference on hate crimes, Clinton
said, "One of the things that I hope will come out of this year is
a national affirmation that violence motivated by prejudice and
hatred hurts us all."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said Americans can no longer ignore "what happens when
racial or ethnic or religious animosity joins with lawlessness."
</P>
<P>
He announced measures including allowing victims of
housing-related hate crimes to seek monetary damages from their
attackers and devoting up to 50 extra FBI agents and federal
prosecutors toward enforcing hate crime laws.
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who thinks that in the world of today and tomorrow
that he or she can hide from the kind of poison that we see in
various places in our country is living in a dream world," Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
The conference was attended by about 350 people, including law
enforcement officials, civil rights activists, educators,
religious leaders and victims of hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
According to Justice Department statistics, 8,759 hate crimes
were reported in 1996, up from 7,947 reported in the previous
year. White House officials said they are not sure whether the
increase indicates that hate crimes are up or better reporting.
</P>
<P>
Race was a factor in 63 percent of all reported hate crimes,
followed by religion, 13.9 percent; sexual orientation, 12
percent; and ethnic origin, 11 percent.

<HEADLINE> US Reaps Good Harvest in Corn, Soybean in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. farmers reaped a
good harvest in corn and soybean as well as some other crops this
year, the Agriculture Department reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The department's latest official production forecast for corn
is some 9.36 billion bushels (one bushel of corn is about 24.42
kilograms), less than 1 percent above the October prediction,
which would be the third-largest crop on record. Farmers have
already harvested 75 percent of the corn, compared to an average
of 64 percent over the last five years.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, 89 percent of the nation's soybean crop has been
harvested, about 4 percentage points above the five-year average.
The soybean projection remained steady at 2.74 billion bushels
(one bushel of soybean is equivalent to 27.216 kilograms), setting
up a new record.
</P>
<P>
Projected corn prices were down this month to between 2.45
dollars and 2.85 dollars per bushel, caused in part by a 100
million-bushel drop in expected exports due to increased foreign
competition. Last year's price was 2.70 dollars a bushel.
</P>
<P>
Soybean prices, on the other hand, were raised to between 5.90
dollars and 6.90 dollars a bushel as estimated reserves were
reduced to 255 million bushels and farmers were rushing the crop
to market to take advantage of already strong prices. Last year's
soybean price was 7.38 dollars a bushel.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Greece believed that current
moves towards resolving the protracted Cyprus problem would
continue in "an effective, just, feasible and final way," Greek
government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said here today.
</P>
<P>
The recent statements by Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem
showed Ankara was moving in the wrong direction because the
northern Cyprus was recognized only by Turkey, the spokesman said
while commenting on a visit by U.S. presidential envoy Richard
Holbrooke to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke is expected to visit Cyprus today for talks with both
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash in a bid to find a solution to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Cem said in the northern Cyprus that
Cyprus could not join the European Union unless the northern
Cyprus was recognized.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has also warned that if the Greek Cypriots enter the EU,
the northern Cyprus would be integrated with Turkey at once.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been unofficially partitioneded since 1974 when
Turkish troops took control of its northern third following an
abortive coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Reppas stressed that President Clerides had stated that he was
willing to discuss the manner in which Turkish Cypriots would take
part in Cyprus' delegation that will negotiate the island
republic's entry into the EU.
</P>
<P>
He also said that U.S. State Department Coordinator for Cyprus,
Thomas Miller, might visit Greece within the next few days.
</P>
<P>
In October, Miller visited Athens for talks with Greek leaders
to discuss the Cyprus problem.

<HEADLINE> Small Firms Contribute to US Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Small businesses account for
59 percent of the exporters in the United States, the local
newspaper the Journal of Commerce reported today.
</P>
<P>
The number of small exporters and the amount they ship overseas
are growing and most of them are planning to boost their export
programs, the paper quoted a survey as saying.
</P>
<P>
Companies with less than 20 employees are considered as small
businesses in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The portion of small companies in U.S. manufacturers rose to
over 18 percent today from less than 10 percent five years ago and
their growing contribution to exports has been spurred by cheaper
technology of exporting and increasing expertise.
</P>
<P>
The companies surveyed report the largest positive impact on
their business from electronic forms of payment, improved
package-tracking systems and e-mail.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Happy About Failure of Scientology Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Germany today applauded the
failure of a U.S. Congress resolution which protested Germany's
treatment of Scientologists.
</P>
<P>
The rejection of the resolution by a big majority at the U.S.
House of Representatives showed that "reason has prevailed among
U.S. members of parliament," German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
was quoted by the German news agency DPA as saying in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
However, he also admitted that more clarification work on the
issue had to be done by Germany in Washington.
</P>
<P>
German government spokesman Peter Hausmann today said that the
rejection of the resolution showed that the Scientology issue had
not put a strain on the German-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which accused the German government of discrimination
against Scientologists, was rejected by a vote of 318 to 101 at
the U.S. House of Representatives Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that those who voted against the resolution had
described it as not well-balanced and detrimental to the
German-U.S ties.
</P>
<P>
Supporters, however, argued that on the issue of religious
freedom, dialogue must be able to be conducted even between close
allies.
</P>
<P>
Scientology has been recognized as a church eligible for
tax-free status in the United States since 1993. But it is not the
case in Germany which says that the group exploits the
insecurities of its members to extract profits from
self-improvement courses. It is also accused of suppressing its
members' freedoms guaranteed under the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The group has been put under nationwide observation by German
counter-intelligence agents since earlier this year after interior
ministers from Germany's 16 states decided that Scientology posed
a possible threat to democracy.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Vows to Act Against US Spy Flight Over Its Skies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraq told the United
Nations today that it no longer recognizes the U.S.-manned U2
flight as part of the U.N. arms inspection and "will act" against
such flights to preserve the country's "sovereignty and security."
</P>
<P>
The statement was made in a letter to U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan from Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Said al-Sahhaf.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister confirmed the reports that an American U2
spy plane flew over Iraq early today despite Iraq threats to shoot
it down.
</P>
<P>
But Baghdad said that the plane, which reportedly crossed into
southern Iraq from northern Saudi Arabia, flew outside the range
of its gunners and the Iraqi forces monitored the aircraft with
radar until it left Iraqi airspace three hours later.
</P>
<P>
The flight "violated under military threat the sovereignty of
an independent state and a founding member of the United Nations,"
al-Sahhaf said.
</P>
<P>
"On the basis of the foregoing, it is no longer one of the U.N.
means of the alleged (weapons) inspection, both in form and name,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The letter came only hours before the U.N. Security Council is
scheduled to review the serious crisis in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister warned that Iraq forces "will act towards
this plane and other American aircraft violating our skies
pursuant to this description in a manner that preserves Iraq's
sovereignty and security."
</P>
<P>
No comments were immediately available from the United Nations
on al-Sahhaf's letter to the U.N. chief.

UNITED NATIONS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The U. N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan today once again urged Iraq to fully
comply with the relevant resolutions of the Security council.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the reporters after briefing the Council on the
report of his three-person mission to Iraq, Annan said the
security Council was grateful to the initiatives taken by the UN
to resolve the crisis over arms inspections, and the Council was
also grateful to the work the three-person mission had done in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the Iraqi government must agree with UN requests and
fully comply with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council
before getting a chance to address the Council.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General stressed that the security council was
united in the position that Iraq must fully comply with the
resolutions of the Security Council.
</P>

The UN chief added there is still time for Iraq to
consider its next move before the Security Council makes its

<HEADLINE> Annan Repeats Call for Iraq's Full Compliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan today repeated his call for Baghdad's full compliance
with the U.N. resolutions on arms inspection in Iraq and its
cooperation with the United Nations on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the appeal after meeting with Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz at the U.N. headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Aziz, who arrived in New York earlier in the day via Concorde
from Paris, explained to the U.N. chief Iraq's position on the
U.N. arms inspection, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
Later today, the U.N. chief was briefed on the unsuccessful
trip made by three envoys last week to Baghdad to persuade Iraq to
reverse its decision on the U.N. weapons inspection on its
territory.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has insisted that Americans in the U.N. arms verification
team were not allowed to take part in the inspection, alleging
that they are American spies.
</P>
<P>
Annan said in a statement that during his meeting with Aziz he
"underscored the message" his envoys had taken to Baghdad,
"stressing that all that was required was for Iraq to undertake to
comply fully with its obligations under all relevant Security
Council resolutions."
</P>
<P>
"Once that was done, I would expect that the Security
Council, in turn, would be prepared to listen to the concerns of
the government of Iraq," he added.
</P>
<P>
Annan and his envoys will inform this afternoon the Security
Council of his initiative to resolve the stalemate on Iraq.

<HEADLINE> MCI Agrees to Be Merged by WorldCom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 10 (Xinhua) -- MCI Communications Corp., the
second largest telecommunications player in the U.S., agreed today
to be bought by WorldCom Inc. for 37 billion U.S. dollars in what
would be the largest corporate merger in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
The offer by WorldCom, the fourth largest long distance company
in the U.S., is 20 percent more than the original bidding.
</P>
<P>
A number of companies have been bidding for buying MCI since
last year. The British Telecommunications Plc (BT) had a 24
billion U.S. dollar merger agreement with MCI. And the GTE Corp.
offered a 28 billion U.S. dollar all-cash deal.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the agreement between MCI and WorldCom strikes a
big blow to GTE.
</P>
<P>
BT will be paid 465 million U.S. dollars because MCI broke its
previous contract to merge with BT, according to reports here. The
British company, which also agreed to the deal, will receive 7.0
billion U.S. dollars from WorldCom for its 20 percent stake in
MCI.
</P>
<P>
The new company will be called MCI WorldCom and will have more
than 30 billion U.S. dollars in annual revenue next year.
</P>
<P>
WorldCom also will assume 5 billion U.S. dollars in MCI debt.
</P>
<P>
The deal will become the largest U.S. merger so far. The
previous record was set by a 25.6 billion U.S. dollar marriage
between Bell Atlantic Corp. and Nynex Corp. in August.
</P>
<P>
The combined MCI-WorldCom will be able to sell a full range of
services, from local and long-distance to Internet connections to
22 million customers in the United States and 200 other countries,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Any deal will require approval from government regulators.
</P>
<P>
The new marriage, if approved by government regulators, will
pose the fiercest challenge to AT&AMP;T Corp.'s once-solid monopoly
on long-distance phone service, according to analysts.

<HEADLINE> Gore: U-2 Will Continue Flying Over Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Vice President Al Gore
today vowed that U.S. spy planes would continue to fly over Iraq
for U.N. weapons inspections and said Iraq had no right to
challenge their flights.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to continue activities such as the U-2 flights,"
Gore said at a Pentagon news conference. "We're going to insist...
that Iraq observe the United Nations resolutions in every
particular."
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on an Iraqi letter to the United Nations
saying it did not recognize the U-2 flights as part of the U.N.
program, Gore said, "It is not for Iraq to decide whether it
recognizes what forces make up the U.N. inspection effort."
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen confirmed at the same news
conference that a U-2 spy plane mission over central Iraq was
completed without direct threats from Iraqi forces.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said it was important that the Security Council, which
was meeting in New York today over the Iraqi crisis, insisted
there be "no exceptions, no negotiations" with Iraq on complying
with U.N. resolutions that authorize weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the White House said President Bill Clinton was
"satisfied that the (U-2) mission went forward."
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Clinton now wanted the
U.N. Security Council to issue an "unambiguous and strong
statement" on resuming weapons inspections, which have been
suspended for a week during talks between U.N. envoys and Iraqi
officials over the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
The U-2 spy plane resumed its flight early today on orders from
the United Nations after a week's delay.
</P>
<P>
The surveillance plane, protectively watched by other U.S. jets
from "no-fly" zones in northern and southern Iraq, crossed the
Iraqi border from Saudi Arabia and stayed over Iraq for some three
hours.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqis were said to have found the plane but did not shoot
as the plane was out of range of anti-aircraft missiles.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- China today asked the
World Trade Organization (WTO) to demonstrate its universality
when admitting applicants particularly developing applicants.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Second Committee (Economic and Financial) of
the 52nd Assembly of the United Nations on the agenda of trade and
development, a Chinese delegate said WTO should remove
inappropriate obstacles posed by some member states and create
opportunities to admit new applicants under conditions that are
congruent with the level and requirement of their economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Shaofu, Minister Counselor of the Permanent Mission of
China to the U.N. pointed out that it is against the trend of
globalization and is harmful to the broader international economic
cooperation to keep some important trade partners out of WTO.
</P>
<P>
He said globalization and liberalization should be preceded by
establishing a fair and non-discriminatory multilateral trade
system and creating a favorable external economic environment
which responds adequately to the needs of the developing countries
and recognizes the diversity and vulnerability of the developing
economies.
</P>
<P>
The international community, Yuan said, especially the
developed countries, should view North-South and South-North
cooperation with a forward-looking vision and support the economic
and trade development of the developing countries with pragmatic
actions.
</P>
<P>
Yuan said that the overall prosperity of the developing
countries and the eradication of poverty in least developed
countries will be the focus of development for the next century.
</P>
<P>
"Only by realizing this objective, can the world be blessed
with truly global and meaningful sustainable development," he
stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan today expressed his regret over Iraq's refusal to
rescind its decision on banning American U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief made the remarks after meeting with Iraqi Deputy
Prime Minister Tareq Aziz at his office at the U.N. headquarters
in New York this noon.
</P>
<P>
Before his meeting, Annan told reporters that he would expect
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to give Aziz some flexibility and
hope to hear the answer that Baghdad would reverse its decision
which had caused the serious crisis.
</P>
<P>
"He (Aziz) has not yet given us the answer we hoped for," Annan
said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"I regret that the government of Iraq has not yet seen its way
to ending this unfortunate situation by complying with the
requirements of the (U.N. Security) Council," Annan told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The United States said today that it would seek tougher
sanctions against Iraq when the U.N. Security Council is going to
meet later today or Tuesday. Washington is also threatening to
take military actions.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he would report to a closed-door council meeting on
his talks with Aziz and on a report by his special mission to
Baghdad last week. The three-member mission failed to persuade
Iraq to reverse its decision on the U.S. arms inspectors.

German schools and did not have a criminal record, CDU General
Secretary Peter Hintze said.
</P>
<P>
The decisions, however, failed to satisfy the junior partner in
Kohl's ruling coalition, the Free Democratic Party (FDP), which
has been calling for more fundamental reforms of the country's
citizenship laws.
</P>
<P>
The citizenship issue has been subject to heated debates in
Germany in recent years given the fact that the country's foreign
population has run up to about 7.3 million, or 9 percent of the
total population.
</P>
<P>
Many Germans have meanwhile come to believe that Germany
already has been a society of varied races and cultures and there
is an urgent need to integrate foreigners who have settled here in
order to defuse rising social tensions.
</P>
<P>
However, there are also fears that easing the German
citizenship law, which is based on the principle of inherited
nationality, would lead to a new influx of foreigners to Germany.

Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) and the weapons inspection
teams, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz stressed here today.

imbalance of the representation of the UNSCOM and the weapons
inspection team, in which Americans accounted for 44 percent in
1996 and 32 percent in 1997.

Aziz said the leading posts of the UNSCOM at the UN
Headquarters were also dominated by Americans, who were
implementing the policies of the U.S. government.

spying Iraqi information for the U.S. government which was against
Iraqi national security and sovereignty.

1991 which had brought bitterness to the Iraqi people, and Iraq
had made its efforts to comply with the commitments of relevant
resolutions of the Security Council.

consider the lifting of the sanctions on Iraq so that the Iraqi
people could have a normal life.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Urges Easing of Iraqi Sufferings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today urged the easing of sufferings of the Iraqi people while
calling upon Baghdad to comply with the United Nations resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak made the statement upon returning home after a few
hours' visit to Saudi Arabia to coordinate stances with Saudi
leaders on the controversial Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
economic conference to be held in Qatar on November 16-18.
</P>
<P>
The Mideast peace developments, bilateral ties, the outcome of
his recent tour of the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Bahrain were
also covered in his talks with Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz and
Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz, Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
He said he sent a message to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
upon the flareup of the crisis after an Iraqi decision to dispel
U.S. arms inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission in charge of
dismantling Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The president said that Egypt's view is that Iraq should abide
by resolutions of the U.N. Security Council to avoid escalation of
U.N. sanctions against Iraq, so that the situation may remain
within the framework of a political solution and avoid the use of
force.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the aim of Egypt is to ease the suffering of
the Iraqi people. He described as inappropriate the principle of
using force.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt is also keen that there should be no division of Iraq as
much as Egypt is keen that there should be no division in Sudan or
any Arab countries," Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has barred U.N. weapon inspection teams that included
Americans for a seventh day. It has charged that the American
inspectors are spies trying to prolong the U.N. sanctions imposed
after the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Copts in Egypt today expressed
their unequivocal rejection to all forms of U.S. intervention in
Egypt's internal affairs under the pretext of safeguarding the
rights of its religious minority.
</P>
<P>
A group of leading Coptic figures and Muslim and Christian
scholars made the stand clear in a statement to reject the call by
some U.S. Congress members for a U.S. intervention to protect the
Copts of Egypt allegedly being religiously persecuted.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the U.S. excuse "harms Egypt as a whole, the
history of Egypt's Copts and rekindles the flames of the country's
sectarian climate."
</P>
<P>
The statement, released under the title of "A statement to the
nation," also brushed off U.S. threats to suspend foreign aid to
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Foreign intervention under the pretext of safeguarding the
Copts is popularly dismissed and has been aborted through the
years, it said.
</P>
<P>
"Since the dawn of history, the Copts of Egypt have confronted
all threats to the country and believed that the interest of the
nation is supreme," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Copts reject any foreign intervention in their affairs, it
added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. has been accusing Cairo of persecuting Copts, whose 6
million population constitutes a tenth of Egypt's whole.

months to buy food and medicine for the Iraqi people who are
suffering under the U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.

The sanctions cannot be lifted until the U.N. weapons
inspection teams certify that Iraq has eliminated all its weapons
of mass destruction.

lift of the sanctions and the approval of its contracts submitted
to the U.N. committee in charge of approving its contracts with
other countries.

<HEADLINE> Iraq: No Intent to Cut Cooperation With UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraq did not intend to stop
its cooperation with U.N. inspectors, a letter sent by Iraqi
Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz to U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said in his letter that Iraq had actually been cooperating
with the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) throughout the
past six and half years.
</P>
<P>
The letter, published by the Iraqi News Agency today, was in
response to the message of Annan to Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, which was delivered on November 3 by Lakhdar Ibrahimi who
headed a U.N. team to Baghdad to help defuse the Iraq-U.N. crisis.
</P>
<P>
Aziz accused some members of the UNSCOM of violating the rules
of neutral and professional work, threatening Iraq's security and
prolonging the on-going U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq decided on October 29 to expel the 10 U.S. inspectors on
the U.N. arms inspection teams, holding them responsible for
delaying the lifting of the economic sanctions imposed by the
U.N. Security Council since its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said in his letter that the visit by Ibrahimi provided
Iraq the first opportunity to make public important facts about
what some arms inspectors had done and what Iraq and its people
had suffered since 1991.
</P>
<P>
He complained that after six and half years, Iraq still could
not see any signs to end the bitter sufferings of its people and
the continued threat to its security under the cover of the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed the necessity to seek a solution to the sufferings
and threats.
</P>
<P>
Aziz called on the U.N. Secretary General to take an impartial
and just stand to put the sufferings of Iraq and its people before
the Security Council for debate.
</P>
<P>
He also called for maintenance of the dialog with Iraq whenever
Annan found it possible and useful.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Denounces Turkish Invasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi Foreign Ministry
today strongly denounced Turkish invasion of northern Iraq on
November 8.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Iraqi news agency, a spokesman of the
ministry said that a group of Turkish armed forces, supported by
tanks and vehicles, carried out a "new invasion" of northern
Iraq, and were still making headway inside Iraqi territory.
</P>
<P>
This aggression inflicted heavy damages upon lives and
properties of the Kurdish people, besides losses in public
properties, he said.
</P>
<P>
He asked the Turkish government to pull out its troops
immediately from Iraqi territory and to refrain from such
invasions which were contrary to the U.N. Charter, the principles
of international law and good neighboring relations.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government strongly condemned the new Turkish
military aggression and denounced the violation of Iraqi
sovereignty and integrity by the Turkish armed forces, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman emphasized that the restoration of legitimate
authority in northern Iraq was the only guarantee for the
establishment of security and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has in recent years frequently launched cross-border
military operations into northern Iraq in an attempt to wipe out
its outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) rebels taking
shelter there. The PKK has been fighting for autonomy in eastern
and southeastern Turkey since 1984.

<HEADLINE> Interest Rates Fall as Liquidity Improves in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Interbank interest rates have
retreated to the mid twenties currently from above 30 percent
last week in Kenya as the money market responded to moderate
liquidity, local reports said today.
</P>
<P>
This improvement was a result of developments in the Treasury
bills market where the T-bill auction resulted in a net-in of
five billion Shillings (80.6 million U.S. Dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
It also came in the wake of the base rate increases effected
by major banks in the past couple of weeks and triggered by
T-bill discount rates, especially the 90-day rate which saw a
drop of 30 basis points last week.
</P>
<P>
The market players are now expectedly to take cue from last
week's reduction and either pitch T-bill tenders lower, or try
and fix higher bank deposits or commercial Paper rates.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the authorities will prefer stability
combined with slow reductions in interest rates and for that
reason the T-bill rates may not fall dramatically in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
T-Bonds traded in the market last week amounted to 1.5 billion
Shillings (24.2 million Dollars). Equities continued to trade
within a narrow range of 3,272-3,308 points, with last week
seeing a fall in prices particularly among blue chips.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Balance of Payment Worsens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The overall balance of
payment up to September this year fell to a surplus of 94 million
U.S. Dollars from 322 million Dollars in the previous year,
according to the latest issue of Economic Review.
</P>
<P>
During the same period under review, the current account
deficit increased from 113 million Dollars to 323 million
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Economic Review, a monthly publication issued by the Central
Bank of Kenya attributed the worsening balance of payment mainly
to a poor trade balance and decline in short-term capital flows.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that in term of values, the increase in imports
surpasses exports due to the weakening of the Kenyan currency of
Shillings against other convertible hard currencies.
</P>
<P>
The trade balance worsened to a deficit of 1,057 million
Dollars by September this year from a deficit of 965 million
Dollars in the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The decision of the International Monetary Fund to suspend a
loan package to Kenya has resulted in a 22 percent decline in
short term capital flows from 464 million Dollars to 362 million
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the services account surplus declined
to 734 million Dollars from previous year's 852 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that a worsening balance of payment
position may cause further weakening of the Shilling against
international hard currencies.

<HEADLINE> PLO Official Calls for Boycotting Doha Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestine Liberation
Organization's (PLO) official Monday night called on Arabs to
boycott the Doha conference which will include Israel.
</P>
<P>
According to the local newspaper Daily Star today, Farouk
Kaddoumi, head of the PLO political department, also warned
against individual nation's possible separate peace deals with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after meeting with Lebanese Foreign
Minister Farez Boueiz at the Foreign Ministry, Kaddoumi said "we
are against Arab countries attending the conference because we
don't expect with meeting to come out with any economic benefits."
</P>
<P>
"The conference was publicized in the Middle East during a
tour by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and aims at
normalizing Arab-Israeli ties and making Arabs who attend look
submissive in the world's eyes," he added.
</P>
<P>
The controversial fourth Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
economic conference is scheduled to be held in Doha on November
16-18 and is expected by the U.S. to lead to greater Arab-Israeli
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria and some other Arab countries have threatened
to boycott the conference in protest against Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line policies.
</P>
<P>
The two countries boycotted the first three conferences in
Casablanca, Amman and Cairo in 1994, 1995 and 1996, arguing that
progress on the political scene should precede economic
normalization between the Arabs and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said "Netanyahu's maneuvers and his refusal to abide by
the peace agreements signed by Labor governments with the Arabs
make the Doha conference and the resumption of peace talks a waste
of time and an attempt to polish Netanyahu's image."
</P>
<P>
Kaddoumi said last week's Palestinian-Israeli negotiations,
held in Washington under the U.S. umbrella, had failed to reach
tangible results.
</P>
<P>
The Tunis-based Palestinian official is an open critic of the
1993 Oslo accords and has so far abstained from returning
permanently to the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Kaddoumi called for more active European and Russian role in
brokering peace in the Middle East, saying that he has voiced this
view in his recent meetings with European Union Middle East envoy
Miguel-Angel Moratinos and Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov.

<HEADLINE> 20 People Feared Dead in Market Fire in N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- At least 20 people were feared
dead and goods estimated at millions of Naira destroyed in a dawn
fire which gutted the Abubakar Gumi Central Market in Kaduna,
north Nigeria, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The fire which started at 2:00 am from a restaurant adjacent
to the main entrance of the market razed the complex, leaving
nothing for the firemen to salvage, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Fire fighters were said to have found it difficult to move
fire fighting machines into the market, owing to the blockade of
the entrance to the market.
</P>
<P>
A bulldozer which attempted to clear the way for the fire
fighters crushed one person while its driver was lynched by an
irate mob.
</P>
<P>
The market police station was completely burnt, while
unconfirmed report said seven suspects were being detained.
</P>
<P>
Several people who attempted to retrieve their goods were hurt
and a victim, who could not control himself, threw himself into
the fire in his shop and was burnt to death.
</P>
<P>
Describing Monday as "the saddest day of my life", State
Administrator Hamed Ali warned against looting, saying a
high powered panel will be set up to probe the incident.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, security operatives arrested more than
20 people for looting while one of the looters was killed by
people at the market.
</P>
<P>
Lorries that brought goods from the southern part of the
country were unable to discharge their loads due to the raging
fire.

ANKARA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Itzhak Mordechai is to visit Turkey from November 8 to 10 to

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The Israeli defense minister is also expected to discuss

</P>
<P>
Mordechai will be the second high-ranking defense official to
visit Turkey in the last two months after Israeli Defense
Forces Chief of Staff Amnon Shahak.
</P>
<P>
The increasing Turkish-Israeli military cooperation has greatly

</P>
<P>
However, Turkey has repeatedly stated that the Turkish-Israeli
cooperation is not directed against any other countries.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Daily Urges to Solve Iraq-US Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 11 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian daily here today
urged the international society to help solve the current
Iraq- U.S. crisis through political rather than military means.
</P>
<P>
Due to the urgency and proximity of this crisis, Iran has
announced its opposition to any military attack on the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq, the daily Iran
News said in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
The daily, which is believed to be close to the Iranian
Foreign Ministry, said that the ongoing Iraq-U.S. conflict "has
turned into a full-fledged crisis with dire consequences not
only for those who are directly involved, but also for the
whole region and the world at large."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Baghdad announced to reject Americans to
join the U.N. disarmament missions in Iraq, triggering a
new crisis between Iraq and the U.S. and the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the U.S. resumption of U-2 intelligence gathering
flights over Iraq, Iran News also urged the U.N. Security
Council to choose a better way to end the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council must realize that military action is
not the way to bring Iraq around," the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Iranian deputy foreign minister for Arab-African affairs Mohammad
Sadr Sunday voiced the country's opposition to any U.S. military
action against Iraq, urging Baghdad not to give any excuse to
the U.S. to take military actions.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharazi arrived in Kuwait this morning from Saudi Arabia on
his second leg of a good-will Gulf tour aimed at improving
relations with its Gulf Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
He was greeted by Kuwaiti first Deputy Prime Minister and
Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah and other
Kuwaiti officials at the airport.
</P>
<P>
During his one-day stay here, Kharazi is expected to hold
talks with Kuwaiti Amir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah and
Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad Al-Salem Al-Sabah
on bilateral relations, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
His Gulf tour, which already took him to Saudi Arabia and
will later take him to other Gulf Cooperation Council states
including Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Oman,
is the first since he took office last August.
</P>
<P>
Kharazi expressed satisfaction Monday with the outcome of the
talks he held with Saudi King Fahd and the Crown Prince
Abdallah Bin Abdel Aziz during his three-day stay in Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference Monday night before wrapping up
his visit there that Iran and Saudi Arabia asserted, as a
result of the talks, that they have common understanding of
regional affairs and their roots, according to Kuwait News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said that the talks covered bilateral ties, Islamic and
Arab ties, the Middle East, the Israeli-Turkish military
cooperation and the Turkish intervention in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He also said he agreed with the Saudi officials to develop
cooperation at the political, economic and cultural levels,
expressing hope that a higher Iranian-Saudi committee would be
formed to follow up sticking issues of bilateral concern.
</P>
<P>
Kharazi also conveyed two letters from the Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami to King Fahd the Crown Prince dealing
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Kharazi acknowledged that the Iranian-GCC relations have been
marred with some problems and asserted that coordination was
necessary to resolve them.
</P>
<P>
But he praised positive overtures made by the GCC states
towards the Iranian new president.
</P>
<P>
He reasserted that his Gulf tour was designed to "create an
adequate atmosphere to strengthen confidence and underscore the
desire of the Iranian government to open a new chapter in the
relations and cooperation with all GCC states."

LUANDA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Parliamentarian members from
various parties expressed their wishes for a final peace in the
country here today, to mark the 22nd anniversary of its
independence which falls on tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Jose Maria, parliamentary member from the ruling People's
Movement for the Liberation of Angola said that on the eve of the
22nd anniversary of Angola's Independence Day, all parties should
unite for the lofty ideal of sustained peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
Maria said that if all parties give up the divergences and
become true compatriots, "it would not be difficult for a true
peace to materialize."
</P>
<P>
Bensamim Da Silva, a parliamentary member from the National
Liberation Front of Angola said that the Independence Day
celebration might be more colorful had a peace and national
reconciliation be realized in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that national interest is higher than that of any
party, and the parties should change their views to concentrate
the country's effort on rebuilding the country which is heavily
undermined by war.
</P>
<P>
Paulo Rangel, another PM from the ruling People's Movement for
the Liberation of Angola said that peace process, the
corner-stone for the future of the country, must be carried out
to the end with full effort.

<HEADLINE> 400,000 Zimbabweans Need Food Aid This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 400,000 Zimbabwean
people whose food stocks have dwindled will need food aid this
year under the government's drought relief program.
</P>
<P>
The National Early Warning Unit said today in its latest food
security bulletin that excessive rains experienced last season
resulted in waterlogging and leaching of soil nutrients in some
parts of the country. As a result, more people could actually be
in need of relief to avert a looming food crisis.
</P>
<P>
The food security bulletin has warned the Grain Marketing
Board (GMB) to shelve exporting maize until it has a clearer
picture of the coming season, given the current warnings of the
El Nino effects.
</P>
<P>
The stocks of maize with the GMB by October 3 this year were
548,934 tons. The present stocks were, however, above the
strategic grain reserve of 500,000 tons by 48,934 tons.

<HEADLINE> UN Population Fund African Regional Meeting Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A five-day African regional
meeting of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) started
here today.
</P>
<P>
The objective of this meeting, which is held every two years,
is to review the implementation of International Conference on
Population and Development (ICPD)'s program of action in terms of
achievements, constraints and lessons learned.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also review recent developments in particular
the ongoing UN reforms and their implications on UNFPA work and
operations.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, UN Population Fund Director Virginia
Ofusu-Umaar told the delegates that most African countries have
experienced significant falls in birth rates and infant mortality
in the last two years following the implementation of population
management programs.
</P>
<P>
She said success was due to increased trained family planning
and reproductive health personnel.
</P>
<P>
She said fertility had fallen by a third in Zimbabwe, while
Kenya had experienced a fall from eight children in the 1970s to
5.5 children.
</P>
<P>
However, there was still a high rate of unwanted pregnancies
and abortions. Nearly 22,000 African women, most of them
adolescents, died annually from unsafe abortion practices.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's National Economic Planning Commissioner Richard
Hove said UNFPA had made a great contribution to the success
Zimbabwe had enjoyed in family planning and other population
related activities.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Dissolves 7th Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi today dissolved the 7th Parliament to pave the way for the
coming General Election in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement issued here today, Moi said that the
dissolution was in exercise of the powers conferred upon him by
the Kenya Constitution.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the program for the General Election to
elect members of the 8th Parliament would be announced in
accordance with Kenya's laws.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Minister for Local Government has also
dissolved all the councils under the Local Government Act.
</P>
<P>
Under the Kenya Constitution, the country's Electoral
Commission is in charge of setting the timetable for nominations
and campaigning.
</P>
<P>
In Kenya's ballot system, there is a gap of five to six weeks
between the dissolution of parliament and the announcement of
polling date while Kenyan law gives at least 21 days for
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
As Kenya's president must also be a MP, there must be a
parliamentary election to go along with a presidential poll.
</P>
<P>
With Moi's term ending on January 4 next year, the
presidential and parliamentary elections are likely to be held in
mid-December this year, most observers here predicted.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Moi, 74 and in power since 1978, launched an
election manifesto of the ruling Kenya African National Union
(KANU) and has already been formally nominated by his party as
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
Most political analysts view Moi as favorite in the General
Election as opposition parties in the east African country are so
divided that they had failed to agree on a single presidential
candidate.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, China Agree to Expand Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(By Liu Yegang, Zhao Yi)
</P>
<P>
PRETORIA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and China today
agreed to further expand trade and economic cooperation in a
meeting between South African Trade and Industry Minister Alec
Erwin and a Chinese delegation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese trade and economic delegation, led by Shi
Guangsheng, deputy minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation, is the largest ever Chinese mission to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Erwin said South Africa, which enjoys rich natural resources
and good infrastructure, attaches importance to developing trade
relations with China, Southeast Asia and Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said he is looking forward to visiting China next year to
explore trade opportunities after normalization of bilateral
relations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
South Africa supports China in its bid for the membership of
the World Trade Organization (WTO), he said, adding that without
China, the WTO would not be complete.
</P>
<P>
He said his country, which faces financial problems, would
encourage foreign trade to help with the economic development.
</P>
<P>
Shi said the two economies are highly complementary and the
two countries could cooperate in various fields in diverse
manners.
</P>
<P>
After the establishment of diplomatic relations between the
two countries, an inter-governmental trade agreement and an
agreement on investment protection are to be signed, Shi said.
</P>
<P>
He said the agreements will provide a sound foundation for
further development of bilateral trade and economic relations.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela announced in November
1996 that his country would establish full diplomatic relations
with the People's Republic of China by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to solve certain problems in
bilateral trade through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation, made up of government officials and
representatives of more than 50 leading Chinese enterprises,
arrived in Johannesburg on Wednesday for an 11-day South African
tour.
</P>
<P>
The delegates are also scheduled to visit Cape Town and Durban
to meet more South African officials and hold more discussions
with South African business leaders.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Party Congress to Pick Top Leaders Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DODOMA (Tanzania), November 10 (Xinhua) -- The fifth national
congress of Tanzania's ruling party CCM, which will pick its top
leaders for the next five years, opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,500 delegates to the congress will elect the party's
national chairman and his two deputies -- one from the Mainland
and another from Zanzibar, as well as 80 NEC (National Executive
Committee of CCM) members.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has sent
a message of congratulations to the congress, praising CCM "has
been scoring gratifying achievements in the cause of leading the
Tanzanian people in safeguarding domestic stability and national
unity as well as in constructing the country and developing the
economy" since its founding 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
CCM, known as the Revolutionary Party, was founded on Feburary
5, 1977. Although multi-party elections were carried out in 1995,
the party secured its position as the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, retired Tanzanian
presidents Nyerere and Mwinyi, and a group of diplomatic envoys
have come to attend the congress being held at the newly-built
hall of Chimwaga.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening of the four-day congress, the incumbent
chairman, President Benjamin Mkapa, said that Tanzania will spare
no efforts to develop economy in the process of structural
adjustment.
</P>
<P>
The country will also create a sound environment for foreign
investment, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the top official of the party called on the
Tanzanian people to rely on themselves so as to get rid of
humiliation of foreign aid with attached political terms.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa also urged leaders at various levels to combat
corruption which has hampered economic development.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is a peace-loving nation which is willing to maintain
friendly and cooperative relationship with its neighbors and the
other countries in the world, and would solve political problems
with them through peaceful consultations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The congress will also amend the party constitution and set a
goal for the development in the next century.

<HEADLINE> 6 People Killed After Drinking "Odontol" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Six people have been killed
in Yaounde after drinking locally brewed whisky, known in
Cameroun's local parlance as "Odontol", said Cameroun Tribune
today.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the Yaounde Central Hospital said four died last
weekend in that hospital while a local chief in Nkolbisson (in
the outskirts of Yaounde) revealed that two villagers died after
drinking "Odontol".
</P>
<P>
Hospital sources said those dead had bought and drunk
"Odontol" in diverse areas in Yaounde.
</P>
<P>
Hospital sources told press that the drink contained highly
toxic elements but at present, they could not identify these
elements.
</P>
<P>
One person who also drank the toxic stuff is reported to have
gone blind and is currently grinding in pain at the Yaounde
Central Hospital.
</P>
<P>
The reports said reaction from the police has been swift. They
have clamped down and seized sizable quantities of "Odontol" in
most drinking spots in Yaounde.
</P>
<P>
The drinking of "Odontol", "Arki" or "Ha" is not a new
phenomenon in Cameroun, a country studded with unprecedented
economic crisis, said the paper, adding that with slashed
salaries, most Camerounians find solace in drinking this locally
brewed whisky which is five times less costly than refined beer
from breweries.

BAGHDAD, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed al-Sahhaf today informed U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan that a U.S. U2 spy plane accompanied by a formation of
American military aircraft had violated Iraqi air space.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Annan, Sahaf said that the U2 aircraft,
accompanied by American aircraft armed with various kinds of
weapons and spying equipment had, under military threat, violated
the sovereignty of an independent U.N. founding state, according
to the Iraqi news agency.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi foreign minister threatened to shoot down the U2 and
other American planes, saying that Iraq would respond in future
"in a manner that preserves Iraq's sovereignty and security."
</P>
<P>
He said in the letter that Iraq no longer recognize U2 flights
as part of the U.N. inspection program.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi military spokesman disclosed this morning that the
American U2 spy plane entered Iraqi airspace at 8:28 a.m. local
time at the Maaina Iraqi-Saudi borders, and left Iraqi airspace
at 11:28 a.m. local time, but was beyond the range of Iraqi
missiles that were all set and monitoring the aircraft.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, Novemebr 10 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian minister of
transport and communications Abdulmejid Hussien today stressed
the importance of establishing a national information network in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a symposium which opened today at Africa Hall here
to mark the World Information Day to be celebrated on November
16, 1997, the minister said the Ethiopian government appreciates
the value of establishing a national information network and the
collective utilization of the resources.
</P>

He said information which has a supportive role in research
and development is a saleable commodity whose price continues to
soar up.
</P>
<P>
The minister said in developing countries such as Ethiopia,
users are neither sufficiently provided with timely and important
information nor have access to information bought at high price.
</P>
<P>
He said well organized information service encourages
investment and modern business activities and promotes
administrative capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Timely and useful data are vital for effecitve and acceptable
research findings, he added.
</P>
<P>
Some 25o participants are attending the three-day symposium in
which 20 study papers will be presented.
</P>
<P>
The symposium is part of celebrations to mark the World
Information Day in Ethiopia. The Ethiopian television will
broadcast special programs on November 16 and 17 in connection
with the World Information Day, according to an earlier

<HEADLINE> Manila Seeks to Boost Electronics Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
drawn up a special incentive package to sustain the growth
momentum of the country's electronics industry, the country's
biggest foreign reserves earner, the local press reports said
today.
</P>
<P>
The package forms part of an eight-point strategy entitled
Philippines Electronics Sector Masterplan, which was recently
approved by the Cabinet, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Foremost in the plan is the creation of a world class science
park which will house world class communications, transport,
power, water and social facilities for the electronics sector.
</P>
<P>
The plan also calls for revisions to the education system for
technology and management students, and implementation of an
upgrade program to encourage multinational firms to assist local
companies to move up the technology ladder.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the plan also urges modification in the ways
investors work with government agencies by streamlining and
simplifying procedures.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Secretary Cesar Bautisa expected the plan to
significantly improve the overall attractiveness of the
Philippines as a regional manufacturing base.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines' exports of electronics products have grown at
an average of over 35 percent annually since 1990, and reached
10.2 billion U.S. dollars in 1996 or nearly two-thirds of the
country's total export earnings that year.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Wants APEC to Name New Members At Vancouver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister
Ali Alatas said Indonesia anticipates that the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders' meeting to be held in
Vancouver, Canada, late this month will name new members of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from setting up criteria for electing new members, I
believe that the summit will be more productive if, based on this,
new members are named," Alatas said here last night.
</P>
<P>
The issue of selecting new APEC members has become increasing
difficult as several members believe that APEC will become
inefficient if it has too many members, officials at the Foreign
Ministry today quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
After last year's meeting in Manila, ministers agreed to
establish conventions for selecting new members, and said their
decision would be announced at next year's meeting in Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
But, Alatas said some APEC members, including Indonesia, want
this decision to be acted upon at the Vancouver meeting and
officiated in the following Kuala Lumpur meeting, adding that as
yet, there has been no agreement on the proposal.
</P>
<P>
At least 11 countries want to join APEC, including Vietnam,
Russia, Peru, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
APEC consists of 18 members -- Australia, Brunei, Canada,
China, Chile, Hong Kong (China), Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia,
Mexico, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, New Zealand, Singapore,
South Korea, Chinese Taipei, Thailand and the United States.

this year than the same month last year, said Statistics NZ in a
media release received today.
</P>
<P>
Motels recorded an occupancy rate of 45.6 percent in September,

occupancy rate of 42.5 percent in the month, while Northland
recorded the lowest rate of 14.5 percent, Statistics NZ said.
</P>
<P>
The poor occupancy rates confirmed the decline in the number of

<HEADLINE> Thailand Cuts Fertilizer Purchase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Ministry of
Agriculture and Cooperatives has decided to cut by nearly half the
amount of chemical fertilizers it planned to buy for the next crop
year, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after Chucheep Harnsawat, who earlier
this year ordered the purchase of one million tons of fertilizers
for the coming crop year, was stepping down last weekend as head
of the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that it will buy only 439,000 tons of three
formulae of fertilizers that farmers urgently need, according to
the reports.
</P>
<P>
The three formulae are the fertilizers with nitrogen,
phosphorous and potassium contents at the ratios of 16-20-0,
16-16-8, and 15-15-15, which are mainly used by rice farmers, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
However, the terms and conditions for the bidding will remain
unchanged, the ministry noted.
</P>
<P>
The cutback was prompted by baht fluctuations and budget
shortfalls, it added.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also said that it will call another round of
bidding if the country's financial situation improves and the new
government wants to procure one million tons of fertilizers.

and children in the womb', the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's 9-month Wine Imports Drop 20 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's imports of wine
totaled 540,000 cases during the first nine months of this year,
down 22 percent compared with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics by the Thai Customs
Department, even imported samples of wine priced at 50 to 70 baht
(1.35 to 1.9 U.S. dollars) also declined significantly during the
period of this year.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's total wine imports for this year are expected at 700
to 800 million baht (19 to 21.6 million dollars), also will
decrease by 20 percent compared with last year, the department
said.
</P>
<P>
The decrease in wine imports was attributed to the country's
economic slowdown and the government's higher tax policies, which
pinched the purchasing power of consumers, the department said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government earlier this year raised the excise tax on
wine from 40 percent to 50 percent and the value added tax from 7
percent to 10 percent.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Port Expected to Surpass 14 Million TEU Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Singapore is expecting
container throughput at its port to break the 14 million TEU
(twenty-foot equivalent unit) mark this year, as container
throughput increased by 8.95 percent in the first nine months of
the year.
</P>
<P>
According to local industrial sources today, the latest
statistics published by the Maritime and Port Authority of
Singapore (MPA), container throughput for the first nine months of
this year totaled 10.45 million TEUs, up from 9.59 million TEUs
compared with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Assuming the same rate of increase is sustained for the
remainder of the year, the Port of Singapore will surpass the 14
million TEU mark by the end of the year, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Last year the Port of Singapore registered a record container
throughput of 12.9 million TEUs, making it the world's second
largest container port behind Hong Kong with 13.5 million TEUs.
</P>
<P>
Continued growth in container throughput at the port, which
comes largely from transshipment to and from the region, indicates
that trade has not been hit by the recent economic turmoil in
Asia, the sources said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States-based
world leading automotive company, General Motors (GM), has planned
to enter the small car market in India, The Observer of Business
and Politics reported today.
</P>
<P>
Disclosing this at a function organized by the Confederation of
Indian Industries (CII) here on Monday, GM chairman John F. Smith
Jr. said that "We plan to introduce Opel Corsa in the Indian
market within the next three-four years."
</P>
<P>
GM international operations president Louis R. Huges said that
the company would induce its component manufacturers to set up
shop in the country.
</P>
<P>
"You can't have a major presence in India with one vehicle and,
therefore, you will see additions in our presence here by way of a
smaller vehicle and a larger vehicle," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Smith, in 1997, GM's combined operations in India
will have invested about 300 million U.S. dollars in the country.
These investments include everything from autos to auto parts,
software and satellites, financial services and locomotives and
advanced radar systems.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Banks to Give Loan to Dhaka's Private Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Bank (BB) has
finalized modalities for a two-billion-taka (about 44.64 U.S.
dollars) industrial development fund to be used by the foreign
banks to boost term loans for the private sector in the country,
according to a BB circular today.
</P>
<P>
"All foreign commercial banks will provide medium and long term
loans to medium and large scale industries in addition to their
present level of industrial financing," the circular stated.
</P>
<P>
"To supplement this additional industrial credit, it has been
decided that the Bangladesh Bank (central bank) will provide
re-finance to the financing banks."
</P>
<P>
The foreign banks in Bangladesh will disburse loans from their
own resources and claim half of the amount disbursed as re-finance
from the central bank, the circular said, adding that the banks
will get the money from the BB at the bank rate.
</P>
<P>
This move to create the special fund was taken last month by
Finance Minister SAMS Kibria amidst allegations by the businessmen
that they could not get long-term loans from banks.
</P>
<P>
As 50 percent of the total loans will be provided from the
special fund, the total amount to be invested under the special
scheme will be 40 billion taka (about 89.28 million dollars), the
circular noted.
</P>
<P>
The BB has stressed that loans from the special fund should be
given on a priority basis to manufacturing industries in the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
Joint venture enterprises including local subsidiaries of
international companies will also be eligible for this fund.
</P>
<P>
The re-financing to the foreign banks will be for a period of
two to seven years, depending on the tenure of the loan sanctioned
to each individual project, the circular added.
</P>
<P>
The foreign banks will have to repay the money to the central
bank in installments which will be fixed for each individual
withdrawal of funds, according to the modalities.
</P>
<P>
A grace period will be given to the banks for repayment of the
money, but banks will have to pay interests on the loans for the
grace period.
</P>
<P>
After the expiry of the grace period, the central bank will
recover the money on quarterly basis, starting from the date on
which the grace period expires, the circular said.

<HEADLINE> India to Discuss Competitive Devaluation Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 11 (XINHUA) -- Competitive devaluation as a
policy option in the wake of the Southeast Asian currency crisis,
and other factors hitting exports are expected to be discussed at
a review meeting Wednesday, an official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be chaired by Prime Minister Inder Kumar
Gujral and attended by some ministers concerned.
</P>
<P>
The government fears an export crisis in the coming months,
with at least three factors acting in conjunction- a sharp fall in
the premium on special import licenses (SIL), the sharp
devaluation of the currencies of competing exporters and the
threat to the country's export schemes by the European Union's
charge that they offer excessive and unfair subsidies.
</P>
<P>
Even going by optimistic projections, the export targets for
1997-98 financial year for major sectors like agricultural
products, gems and jewelry, and textiles and garments are likely
to be missed, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The three sectors cumulatively account for more than half of
Indian exports, with agriculture contributing 19 percent, gems and
jewelry 17 percent and textiles and garments 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The huge devaluation by several competing countries and their
ability to undercut prices by almost 10-15 percent is expected to
hurt the overall growth rate. The Pakistani rupee's fall to 42
rupees per U.S. dollar from 34 rupees a dollar a few months ago is
hurting India's rice exports. India has predicted that textiles,
chemicals, agricultural products, particularly marine products and
rice would be hit further in future.

<HEADLINE> Conference on Refugees, Migratory Movements Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- A two-day South Asian conference
on refugees and migratory movements began here Monday, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of India, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and
Bangladesh attended the conference. In the past five decades, the
South Asian region witnessed mass involuntary movements of 35
million to 40 million people.
</P>
<P>
The conference is being held under the auspices of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees with wide participation of
"eminent persons" groups who work closely with the UN body in
their respective countries, the Daily Star said.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Star added that the region experienced many migratory
movements including the Indo-Pakistan refugee flow in 1947, which
was the largest international flow in the world history.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad told the
conference that "Bangladesh has been both a country of origin and
also a generous enough country for asylum."
</P>
<P>
"We, therefore, have a clear perspective of the issue and all
that it involves," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are not a party to the 1951 Refugee Convention or its 1967
Protocol. No country from South Asia has yet become a party," the
minister noted, adding "however, we do attach importance to both
these documents and strive to ensure that our activities and
attitude conform to their provisions."

WELLINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister-
designate Jenny Shipley denied today an Australian report that she
is preparing to end the ban on nuclear-powered warship using NZ
ports.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald quoted Shipley today as saying that
she would be prepared to raise with New Zealanders the prospect of
ditching the decade-old nuclear ban, but only in extreme,
"strategic" circumstances.
</P>
<P>
In a personal statement in parliament this afternoon, Shipley
said the report was untrue, Radio NZ reported.
</P>
<P>
"I want to categorically put this matter to rest that at no
stage that I raised any such suggestion that New Zealand would
ever contemplate under a National-New Zealand First Government
lifting such a ban," she stated.
</P>
<P>
Shipley was supported by NZ First leader Winston Peters, who
described the Australian report as unfounded.

<P>
CANBERRA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar edged
higher in trade today but a lack of incentives left it to close
just shy of 70.00 US cents.
</P>
<P>
The local unit settled at 69.94 US cents, from 69.58
previously.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the currency had received an early boost in a
quiet market from some local buying this morning.
</P>
<P>
"It was a bit of a short market and we saw a short squeeze,"
Commonwealth Bank corporate foreign exchange senior manager
Stavros Nitis said.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the focus remained on global sharemarkets and, in
particular, those in the Southeast Asian region.
</P>
<P>
As a result, a strengthening Australian Stock Exchange and Hong
Kong bourse also helped the local unit higher today.
</P>
<P>
The market had been wary this morning, expecting Friday's
decline on Wall Street would translate into a weaker equity market
here.
</P>
<P>
On the Australian Stock Exchange today the all ordinaries index
closed up 2.4 points at 2524.0, after losing some ground earlier
in the session.
</P>
<P>
In late trading in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index was up 101.81
points at 10094.65, after trading to an earlier high of 10251.65.
</P>
<P>
However, local traders said the sustained rises on the
sharemarkets still had to be seen and downside pressure remained
on the Australian dollar due to the Southeast Asian turmoil.
</P>
<P>
On the cross rates, the Australian dollar finished at 87.31 yen
from 86.21 previously, and at 1.1886 marks from 1.2001.

<P>
KATHMANDU, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Surya
Bahadur Thapa said here today that Tibet is an autonomous region
of China, and Nepal is strongly opposed to using its territory for
activities against China, in particular unfriendly activities for
splitting Tibet from China.
</P>
<P>
All political parties in Nepal hold this view on Tibet issue,
Thapa said when meeting a Chinese delegation led by Chen Muhua,
vice chairperson of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress of China.
</P>
<P>
Thapa said Nepal and China are friendly neighbors with no
contradictions and problems existing between them, and the ties
between them are old and solid.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Nepal's policy towards China is clear-cut,
Nepal is strongly opposed to creating two Chinas.
</P>
<P>
Chen Muhua expressed her appreciation over Nepal's stand on
Tibet, saying that the Chinese government hopes to get continued
support from Nepal on this issue.
</P>
<P>
Chen said China is also grateful that Nepal resisted pressure
from some Western countries and supported China on the human
rights issue.
</P>
<P>
She said last year King Birendra and President Jiang Zemin
exchanged visits, opening a new vista for developing new relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>

SINGAPORE, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Share prices rallied on the
Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index
rose by 20.41 points to close at 1684.1 points today.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that share prices were pushed higher as investors
took the opportunity to bargain hunt after recent falls. Property
stocks led the rebound following weekend comments by the
government that it was monitoring the property market.
</P>
<P>
However, dealers also noted that the market sentiment remained
cautious, weighed down by regional currency woes in fears of
slower growth.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lee Hoi-chang's Ratings Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 10 (Xinhua) -- With the presidential election
38 days away, presidential candidate Lee Hoi-chang of the largest
New Korea Party (NKP) experienced a jump in his popularity ratings
in the latest opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
But his improvement fell short to affecting the ongoing
triangular presidential race in which opposition leader Kim
Dae-jung remains in the lead and former Kyonggi governor Rhee
In-je keeps the second place.
</P>
<P>
The latest polls, launched by major dailies over the weekend,
showed that Lee has regained over 20 percent support, though still
trailed behind Kim with 30s percent and Rhee with 20 plus percent.
</P>
<P>
Lee once topped public approval ratings among the candidates
when he was elected the NKP's candidate in July.
</P>
<P>
But his popularity nosedived to less than 20 percent after
allegations that his two sons evaded military service.
</P>
<P>
The polls were the first to be published after the presidential
race became a three-way competition between Kim, Rhee and Lee.
</P>
<P>
Cho Soon, a former Seoul mayor, has given up his presidential
bid after agreeing to merge his small opposition Democratic Party
with Lee's NKP last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Pollsters attributed Lee's upsurge in popularity to the
agreement on the merger and NKP officials projected Lee's
popularity will further improve.
</P>
<P>
The decrease in Rhee's popularity came after his rivals accused
President Kim Young-sam of supporting his bid.
</P>
<P>
Rhee's rivals suspect that the president might be backing Rhee,
his former close associate, citing the fact that Rhee's party is
mainly composed of Kim's followers.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the main opposition National Congress for New
Politics led by Kim Dae-jung said its Kim will benefit the most
from the fierce competition between Rhee and Lee.

promise to triple his country's presence there in 10 years. He
made the promise during his visit to Singapore in February 1996.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Economic and trade cooperation
between China and Japan, the two countries whose economies are
highly complementary to each other, has good prospects for further
development after achieving fruitful results in recent years.
</P>
<P>
With the deepening of reforms, the advance of science and
technology and of the level of industrial production, China has
increased its export capability with greatly improved product
quality and an adjusted product mix, thus promoting the
development of foreign trade, including Sino-Japanese economic and
trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the overall Sino-Japanese trade volume
reached 60.06 billion U.S. dollars in 1996, with China becoming
Japan's second largest trading partner, and Japan becoming China's
largest trading partner.
</P>
<P>
This year saw further growth. Sino-Japanese trade increased
to 37.46 billion dollars in the first eight months of this year
and is expected to reach 65 billion dollars by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Economic cooperation also registered great progress. By the end
of 1996, Japan had set up nearly 15,000 companies and firms in
China with an actual investment at 14.2 billion dollars, becoming
China's largest foreign investor.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the improved investment environment in China and the
management skills of Japanese companies, the majority of the firms
with Japanese investment, mostly manufacturers, are successful in
yielding good returns. Many Japanese firms have expanded their
investment in China.
</P>
<P>
Since 1979, China has used a total of 1,610.9 billion yen in
loans, offered by the Japanese government in three packages, in 64
projects.
</P>
<P>
The fourth package of Japanese yen loans covers the five
years from 1996 to 2000. The loans for the first three years
amount to 580 billion yen in support of 40 projects in energy,
communications, environmental protection, agriculture and other
fields.
</P>
<P>
Okazaki Yugi, a member of the board of directors of the Japan
Association for the Promotion of International Trade, believes
that Sino-Japanese economic and trade cooperation will further
expand despite issues that demand immediate solution and new
subjects that need more exploration.
</P>
<P>
Japanese enterprises can play a role in the development of the
central and western areas of China, the construction of the Three
Gorges Dam and high speed railways in China, Okazaki said.
</P>
<P>
The future of economic and trade cooperation between China and
Japan should be a very bright one.

<HEADLINE> Two Key U.S. Senators Back NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Two key senators of the
United States said today after a series of hearings that expanding
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was the correct
policy for Washington to pursue.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Senate colleagues, Jesse Helms, chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Joseph Biden, the ranking
Democrat, expressed their views on bringing new members into the
16-nation NATO.
</P>
<P>
"We are persuaded the overwhelming weight of testimony
reinforces the argument for NATO enlargement," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
The two senators said they expected the costs of NATO
enlargement to be "relatively small for the U.S. and affordable
for new and current European allies."
</P>
<P>
They cited testimony by Clinton administration officials that
the cost is likely to be less than the Pentagon projected in
February because the military infrastructure in these countries is
in better condition than previously estimated.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon estimated that total expansion cost from 1997 to
2007 would be between 27 billion and 35 billion dollars, with
U.S. costs in the range of 1.5 billion to two billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The hearings "helped to ease concerns on various points related
to relations with Russia," which vigorously opposed enlargement of
the alliance to its eastern border by including three former
Warsaw pact members, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The new NATO-Russia Joint Council, established to make
enlargement more palatable to Moscow, "will have no undue
influence or veto" over NATO decisions.
</P>
<P>
NATO leaders agreed to accept Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic by 1999 as full members. The agreement needs to be
ratified by the Senate with a two-thirds majority vote.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso and his Argentine counterpart Carlos Menem said
here today that they enjoy the good bilateral relations and desire
to achieve "an alliance for an admirable integration."
</P>
<P>
In a communique, Cardoso and Menem said that it is important to
cooperate in nuclear energy, electrical power, education, culture,
technology and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
They said that education will be a central theme in the 2nd
Summit of the Americas to be held in Santiago, Chile, in 1998 and
stressed the necessity of cooperation among countries to attach
importance to this sector.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents signed three declarations on cooperation in
the Southern Common Market (Mercosur), nuclear control and land
mines control.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso and Menem also signed agreements on educational
cooperation through telecommunication technology, the control of
the Sao Borja-Santo Tome border and creation of a commission for
the development and cooperation on border areas.
</P>
<P>
Menem arrived here today for a two-day visit, after taking part
in the 7th Ibero-American Summit in the Margarita Island, Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Brazil and Argentina are two major partners in the Mercosur
which also consists of Uruguay and Paraguay. Trade between the
them rose from 3 billion U.S. dollars in 1991 to 12 billion
dollars in 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic is ready
to pay for its North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
membership and participate in peace-keeping in Bosnia after June
1998, Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference after meeting with U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright, Klaus acknowledged there was "no room
for free riding" in joining NATO.
</P>
<P>
The Czech government's military spending in 1998 would total
230 million U.S. dollars -- 200 million for its armed forces and
30 million for NATO operating costs, Klaus said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We know it's impossible to be consumers of collective
security. We have to be producers as well."
</P>
<P>
In July, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland were invited to
join NATO, with the Czech Republic however reportedly lagging
behind the other two in preparations for the move.
</P>
<P>
During his week-long trip here, Klaus also met other senior
U.S. officials, Congress members and businessmen.

<HEADLINE> Peacekeepers Should Avoid Domestic Affairs: Qin Huasun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- China said today that
although peacekeeping operations have increasingly dealt with
countries' internal conflicts in recent years, that should not be
used as an excuse to interfere in the internal affairs of these
countries.
</P>
<P>
This was expounded by Qin Huasun, permanent representative of
China to the United Nations. He was speaking at the Fourth
Committee (Special Political and Neocolonization) of the
U.N. General Assembly on the agenda of peacekeeping operations,
today.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council should strengthen its guidance and
supervision over multinational forces to prevent and stop any act
that goes beyond the mandate given by the Council, and jeopardizes
the reputation and image of the United Nations, Qin said.
</P>
<P>
He said a necessary and stable financial basis is essential to
the success of any peacekeeping operation. The the withholding of
peacekeeping assessments by Member States, in particular some
major contributors, has seriously dampened the enthusiasm of
troop-contributing countries.
</P>
<P>
He called on the concerned countries to rapidly clear their
arrears, in full and without conditions.
</P>
<P>
Qin said enhancing the rapid-deployment capacity of
peacekeeping operations is important in effectively implementing
the relevant resolutions of the Council and preventing situations
from getting out of control.
</P>
<P>
China supports U.N. efforts to enhance stand-by
arrangements and announced last May its readiness to participate
in them, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
As the President of the Security Council this month, Qin said,
China will continue to urge the Council to devote more time to
discussing and resolving African issues. China hoped the U.N. will
provide more assistance to African countries and organizations to
enhance Africa's capacity to prevent and resolve conflicts
on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Peace and development are the two major issues in today's
world, Qin said. Many conflicts in the world were, in
the final analysis, caused by the question of development.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. should make great efforts to promote development and
help lift developing countries, particularly the least developed
nations, out of poverty as the only way to truly prevent conflicts
and secure an environment of long-term stability and peace, Qin
said.

<HEADLINE> Chile's Fish Exports Grow by 7.1 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Chile's fish exports amounted
to 1.43 billion U.S. dollars during the first nine months this
year, up 7.1 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The National Society of Fishing said the figure slightly
outgrows projections made for the year.
</P>
<P>
It said the outcome is due to the high captures achieved in the
northern coast, the stable high price of fish meal and the strong
start of salmon fishing over the last quarter.
</P>
<P>
The society termed as "relative" the impact of the "El Nino"
phenomenon in the fishing industry. In the northern zone, the
capture of anchovy increased by 48 percent, while in the
mid-southern zone, captures of saurel dropped by 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Nonetheless, the latter figure is compensated by captures of
other species like sardines and anchovy, a better production of
canned saurel and the best price of fish meal," it said.

<HEADLINE> Asian Financial Crisis Would Mean Slowdown in World Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The financial crisis
originating from Southeast Asia would mean a slowdown in world
economic growth perhaps by as much as one percentage point, a
high-ranking U.N. official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the U.N. Economic and Financial Committee, Secretary
General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD) Rubens Ricupero said that for the first time a crisis
originating in the developing world has had a profound impact on
capital markets of the North.
</P>
<P>
"No one is immune from the effects of actions taken or not
taken in another country or on the other side of the globe," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the Asian financial crisis is firmly located
in the private sector and revolved around market rather than
government failure.
</P>
<P>
However, Ricupero said, the immediate danger is the
overreaction by policy-makers, as unduly heavy-handed
macroeconomic response could set back reform efforts in developing
countries for the foreseeable future.

<HEADLINE> Apple Unveils New Models </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Apple Computer Inc. today
introduced a new family of computers.
</P>
<P>
Fighting back from stubborn losses and an unsatisfactory market
share, the computer maker has introduced a next-generation family
called the Power Macintosh G3. It is based on the fastest
available personal computer processors, with increased performance
and a lower cost, starting at around 2,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The new desk-top and lap-top computers Apple unveiled today use a
new version of the PowerPC microprocessors that run at speeds of
233 and 266 megahertz, and are comparable to the newest Pentium II
processors from Intel Corp.
</P>
<P>
Apple Computer Inc. pioneered the commercial personal computer
in the late 1970s and made computing easy with the Macintosh in
the mid-1980s. But the company was hammered by the growing
popularity of Windows-based computers, and suffered alarming
losses to its bottom line and market share.
</P>
<P>
The company has gone through several reorganizations and bouts
of cost-cutting. Since July, Apple has drastically restricted the
ability of other computer makers to clone Macs, and forged an
alliance with longtime rival, Microsoft.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Announces New Package of Economic Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian government today
announced a series of new economic measures, aiming to cut public
spending, raise taxes, stabilize financial market and attract more
foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
A package of 51 measures is expected to increase 20 billion
U.S. dollars in revenue for the country, and maintain the
stability of the Brazilian currency to avoid high inflation.
</P>
<P>
The package will reduce 15 percent of administrative spendings
and 6 percent of government's investment. But the measures will
not affect reforms of education, health, social welfare and
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
With the package, the government will lay off 33,000 workers to
save 5.2 billion dollars, and raise taxes of industrial products,
specially cars and beverages.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Brazilian President Fernando Cardoso said today that
it was important for his country to take such measures, for the
adjustments could defend a strong currency and prevent high
inflation rate from affecting the country again.
</P>
<P>
He admitted the measures will be a bitter pill for taxpayers,
but will not affect their daily life and incomes.
</P>
<P>
The package is another temporary move by the Brazilian
government after the Brazilian financial market was affected by
the turmoil in Asian markets. The Central Bank of Brazil increased
the monthly interest from 1.58 percent to 3.05 percent and sold
billions of dollars of its reserves to maintain the current
exchange rate between real and U.S. dollar.

<HEADLINE> New Vaccine Against Cancer Tested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, November 11 (Xinhua)-- A promising new vaccine which
is expected to kill cancer cells is now being tested at Oslo's
Radium Hospital, according to a recent report from Norway.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 patients suffering from cancer of the colon or the
pancreas have been treated with the vaccine. For about half of
this group, it appears to have led to promising results.
</P>
<P>
The vaccine aimed to strengthen the immunity mechanisms of
cancer patients who have already undergone surgery and to kill the
cancerous cells which can cause the disease to spread. This method
has the advantage over traditional follow-up treatments like
radiation in that it has no side affects.
</P>
<P>
The vaccine, which was developed in Norway, is injected
directly beneath the skin where it activates the skin's immune
cells, causing them to alert the entire immune system and thereby
trigger an all-out attack on the cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
Gustav Gaudernack, senior researcher at the hospital and leader
for the vaccine program, said the method was still at the
experimental stage, but they had already got firm proof that the
vaccine causes cancer cells to die.
</P>
<P>
Next year, tests will begin with new and much bigger patient
groups, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the longer term, the team hopes to develop a preventive
vaccine, enabling people in special high-risk groups to be
vaccinated at an early age.
</P>
<P>
"This could perhaps halt the disease before it breaks out,"
said Gaudernack.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Convenes Conference on Hate Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- With hate crimes increasing
in the country, U.S. President Bill Clinton Monday called for
tougher laws to include all hate crimes that cause physical harm.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the White House Conference on hate crimes, Clinton
said, "One of the things that I hope will come out of this year is
a national affirmation that violence motivated by prejudice and
hatred hurts us all."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said Americans can no longer ignore "what happens when
racial or ethnic or religious animosity joins with lawlessness."
</P>
<P>
He announced measures including allowing victims of
housing-related hate crimes to seek monetary damages from their
attackers and devoting up to 50 extra FBI agents and federal
prosecutors toward enforcing hate crime laws.
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who thinks that in the world of today and tomorrow
that he or she can hide from the kind of poison that we see in
various places in our country is living in a dream world," Clinton
said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Efforts for Solving Cyprus Issue Will Continue, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Greece believed that current
moves towards resolving the protracted Cyprus problem would
continue in "an effective, just, feasible and final way," Greek
government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said here today.
</P>
<P>
The recent statements by Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem
showed Ankara was moving in the wrong direction because the
northern Cyprus was recognized only by Turkey, the spokesman said
while commenting on a visit by U.S. presidential envoy Richard
Holbrooke to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke is expected to visit Cyprus today for talks with both
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash in a bid to find a solution to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Cem said in the northern Cyprus that
Cyprus could not join the European Union unless the northern
Cyprus was recognized.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has also warned that if the Greek Cypriots enter the EU,
the northern Cyprus would be integrated with Turkey at once.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been unofficially partitioneded since 1974 when
Turkish troops took control of its northern third following an
abortive coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Reppas stressed that President Clerides had stated that he was
willing to discuss the manner in which Turkish Cypriots would take
part in Cyprus' delegation that will negotiate the island
republic's entry into the EU.
</P>
<P>
He also said that U.S. State Department Coordinator for Cyprus,
Thomas Miller, might visit Greece within the next few days.
</P>
<P>
In October, Miller visited Athens for talks with Greek leaders
to discuss the Cyprus problem.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- China today asked the
World Trade Organization (WTO) to demonstrate its universality
when admitting applicants particularly developing applicants.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Second Committee (Economic and Financial) of
the 52nd Assembly of the United Nations on the agenda of trade and
development, a Chinese delegate said WTO should remove
inappropriate obstacles posed by some member states and create
opportunities to admit new applicants under conditions that are
congruent with the level and requirement of their economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Shaofu, Minister Counselor of the Permanent Mission of
China to the U.N. pointed out that it is against the trend of
globalization and is harmful to the broader international economic
cooperation to keep some important trade partners out of WTO.
</P>
<P>
He said globalization and liberalization should be preceded by
establishing a fair and non-discriminatory multilateral trade
system and creating a favorable external economic environment
which responds adequately to the needs of the developing countries
and recognizes the diversity and vulnerability of the developing
economies.
</P>
<P>
The international community, Yuan said, especially the
developed countries, should view North-South and South-North
cooperation with a forward-looking vision and support the economic
and trade development of the developing countries with pragmatic
actions.
</P>
<P>
Yuan said that the overall prosperity of the developing
countries and the eradication of poverty in least developed
countries will be the focus of development for the next century.
</P>
<P>
"Only by realizing this objective, can the world be blessed
with truly global and meaningful sustainable development," he
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Urges Easing of Iraqi Sufferings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today urged the easing of sufferings of the Iraqi people while
calling upon Baghdad to comply with the United Nations resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak made the statement upon returning home after a few
hours' visit to Saudi Arabia to coordinate stances with Saudi
leaders on the controversial Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
economic conference to be held in Qatar on November 16-18.
</P>
<P>
The Mideast peace developments, bilateral ties, the outcome of
his recent tour of the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Bahrain were
also covered in his talks with Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz and
Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz, Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
He said he sent a message to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
upon the flareup of the crisis after an Iraqi decision to dispel
U.S. arms inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission in charge of
dismantling Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The president said that Egypt's view is that Iraq should abide
by resolutions of the U.N. Security Council to avoid escalation of
U.N. sanctions against Iraq, so that the situation may remain
within the framework of a political solution and avoid the use of
force.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the aim of Egypt is to ease the suffering of
the Iraqi people. He described as inappropriate the principle of
using force.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt is also keen that there should be no division of Iraq as
much as Egypt is keen that there should be no division in Sudan or
any Arab countries," Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has barred U.N. weapon inspection teams that included
Americans for a seventh day. It has charged that the American
inspectors are spies trying to prolong the U.N. sanctions imposed
after the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Copts in Egypt today expressed
their unequivocal rejection to all forms of U.S. intervention in
Egypt's internal affairs under the pretext of safeguarding the
rights of its religious minority.
</P>
<P>
A group of leading Coptic figures and Muslim and Christian
scholars made the stand clear in a statement to reject the call by
some U.S. Congress members for a U.S. intervention to protect the
Copts of Egypt allegedly being religiously persecuted.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the U.S. excuse "harms Egypt as a whole, the
history of Egypt's Copts and rekindles the flames of the country's
sectarian climate."
</P>
<P>
The statement, released under the title of "A statement to the
nation," also brushed off U.S. threats to suspend foreign aid to
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Foreign intervention under the pretext of safeguarding the
Copts is popularly dismissed and has been aborted through the
years, it said.
</P>
<P>
"Since the dawn of history, the Copts of Egypt have confronted
all threats to the country and believed that the interest of the
nation is supreme," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Copts reject any foreign intervention in their affairs, it
added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. has been accusing Cairo of persecuting Copts, whose 6
million population constitutes a tenth of Egypt's whole.

BAGHDAD, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has received the first
shipment of foodstuffs within the framework of the second phase of
the oil-for-food deal between Iraq and the United Nations, a

supplies to Iraq within the first phase of the deal, which ended
on June 8, amounted to 2.5 million tonnes. However, he added that
only 40 percent of medicines and medical equipment were received
during the period.
</P>
<P>
So far, Iraq has received no shipment of medicine under the
second phase of the accord which started on June 9.

Iraq is allowed to export 2 billion dollars worth of oil over six
months to buy food and medicine for the Iraqi people who are
suffering under the U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions cannot be lifted until the U.N. weapons
inspection teams certify that Iraq has eliminated all its weapons
of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly accused the United States of blocking the
lift of the sanctions and the approval of its contracts submitted
to the U.N. committee in charge of approving its contracts with
other countries.

<HEADLINE> Iraq: No Intent to Cut Cooperation With UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraq did not intend to stop
its cooperation with U.N. inspectors, a letter sent by Iraqi
Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz to U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said in his letter that Iraq had actually been cooperating
with the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) throughout the
past six and half years.
</P>
<P>
The letter, published by the Iraqi News Agency today, was in
response to the message of Annan to Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, which was delivered on November 3 by Lakhdar Ibrahimi who
headed a U.N. team to Baghdad to help defuse the Iraq-U.N. crisis.
</P>
<P>
Aziz accused some members of the UNSCOM of violating the rules
of neutral and professional work, threatening Iraq's security and
prolonging the on-going U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq decided on October 29 to expel the 10 U.S. inspectors on
the U.N. arms inspection teams, holding them responsible for
delaying the lifting of the economic sanctions imposed by the
U.N. Security Council since its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said in his letter that the visit by Ibrahimi provided
Iraq the first opportunity to make public important facts about
what some arms inspectors had done and what Iraq and its people
had suffered since 1991.
</P>
<P>
He complained that after six and half years, Iraq still could
not see any signs to end the bitter sufferings of its people and
the continued threat to its security under the cover of the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed the necessity to seek a solution to the sufferings
and threats.
</P>
<P>
Aziz called on the U.N. Secretary General to take an impartial
and just stand to put the sufferings of Iraq and its people before
the Security Council for debate.
</P>
<P>
He also called for maintenance of the dialog with Iraq whenever
Annan found it possible and useful.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Denounces Turkish Invasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi Foreign Ministry
today strongly denounced Turkish invasion of northern Iraq on
November 8.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Iraqi news agency, a spokesman of the
ministry said that a group of Turkish armed forces, supported by
tanks and vehicles, carried out a "new invasion" of northern
Iraq, and were still making headway inside Iraqi territory.
</P>
<P>
This aggression inflicted heavy damages upon lives and
properties of the Kurdish people, besides losses in public
properties, he said.
</P>
<P>
He asked the Turkish government to pull out its troops
immediately from Iraqi territory and to refrain from such
invasions which were contrary to the U.N. Charter, the principles
of international law and good neighboring relations.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government strongly condemned the new Turkish
military aggression and denounced the violation of Iraqi
sovereignty and integrity by the Turkish armed forces, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman emphasized that the restoration of legitimate
authority in northern Iraq was the only guarantee for the
establishment of security and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has in recent years frequently launched cross-border
military operations into northern Iraq in an attempt to wipe out
its outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) rebels taking
shelter there. The PKK has been fighting for autonomy in eastern
and southeastern Turkey since 1984.

<HEADLINE> Interest Rates Fall as Liquidity Improves in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Interbank interest rates have
retreated to the mid twenties currently from above 30 percent
last week in Kenya as the money market responded to moderate
liquidity, local reports said today.
</P>
<P>
This improvement was a result of developments in the Treasury
bills market where the T-bill auction resulted in a net-in of
five billion Shillings (80.6 million U.S. Dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
It also came in the wake of the base rate increases effected
by major banks in the past couple of weeks and triggered by
T-bill discount rates, especially the 90-day rate which saw a
drop of 30 basis points last week.
</P>
<P>
The market players are now expectedly to take cue from last
week's reduction and either pitch T-bill tenders lower, or try
and fix higher bank deposits or commercial Paper rates.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the authorities will prefer stability
combined with slow reductions in interest rates and for that
reason the T-bill rates may not fall dramatically in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
T-Bonds traded in the market last week amounted to 1.5 billion
Shillings (24.2 million Dollars). Equities continued to trade
within a narrow range of 3,272-3,308 points, with last week
seeing a fall in prices particularly among blue chips.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Balance of Payment Worsens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The overall balance of
payment up to September this year fell to a surplus of 94 million
U.S. Dollars from 322 million Dollars in the previous year,
according to the latest issue of Economic Review.
</P>
<P>
During the same period under review, the current account
deficit increased from 113 million Dollars to 323 million
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Economic Review, a monthly publication issued by the Central
Bank of Kenya attributed the worsening balance of payment mainly
to a poor trade balance and decline in short-term capital flows.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that in term of values, the increase in imports
surpasses exports due to the weakening of the Kenyan currency of
Shillings against other convertible hard currencies.
</P>
<P>
The trade balance worsened to a deficit of 1,057 million
Dollars by September this year from a deficit of 965 million
Dollars in the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The decision of the International Monetary Fund to suspend a
loan package to Kenya has resulted in a 22 percent decline in
short term capital flows from 464 million Dollars to 362 million
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the services account surplus declined
to 734 million Dollars from previous year's 852 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that a worsening balance of payment
position may cause further weakening of the Shilling against
international hard currencies.

<HEADLINE> PLO Official Calls for Boycotting Doha Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestine Liberation
Organization's (PLO) official Monday night called on Arabs to
boycott the Doha conference which will include Israel.
</P>
<P>
According to the local newspaper Daily Star today, Farouk
Kaddoumi, head of the PLO political department, also warned
against individual nation's possible separate peace deals with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after meeting with Lebanese Foreign
Minister Farez Boueiz at the Foreign Ministry, Kaddoumi said "we
are against Arab countries attending the conference because we
don't expect with meeting to come out with any economic benefits."
</P>
<P>
"The conference was publicized in the Middle East during a
tour by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and aims at
normalizing Arab-Israeli ties and making Arabs who attend look
submissive in the world's eyes," he added.
</P>
<P>
The controversial fourth Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
economic conference is scheduled to be held in Doha on November
16-18 and is expected by the U.S. to lead to greater Arab-Israeli
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria and some other Arab countries have threatened
to boycott the conference in protest against Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line policies.
</P>
<P>
The two countries boycotted the first three conferences in
Casablanca, Amman and Cairo in 1994, 1995 and 1996, arguing that
progress on the political scene should precede economic
normalization between the Arabs and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said "Netanyahu's maneuvers and his refusal to abide by
the peace agreements signed by Labor governments with the Arabs
make the Doha conference and the resumption of peace talks a waste
of time and an attempt to polish Netanyahu's image."
</P>
<P>
Kaddoumi said last week's Palestinian-Israeli negotiations,
held in Washington under the U.S. umbrella, had failed to reach
tangible results.
</P>
<P>
The Tunis-based Palestinian official is an open critic of the
1993 Oslo accords and has so far abstained from returning
permanently to the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Kaddoumi called for more active European and Russian role in
brokering peace in the Middle East, saying that he has voiced this
view in his recent meetings with European Union Middle East envoy
Miguel-Angel Moratinos and Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- At least 20 people were feared
dead and goods estimated at millions of Naira destroyed in a dawn
fire which gutted the Abubakar Gumi Central Market in Kaduna,
north Nigeria, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The fire which started at 2:00 am from a restaurant adjacent
to the main entrance of the market razed the complex, leaving
nothing for the firemen to salvage, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Fire fighters were said to have found it difficult to move
fire fighting machines into the market, owing to the blockade of
the entrance to the market.
</P>
<P>
A bulldozer which attempted to clear the way for the fire
fighters crushed one person while its driver was lynched by an
irate mob.
</P>
<P>
The market police station was completely burnt, while
unconfirmed report said seven suspects were being detained.
</P>
<P>
Several people who attempted to retrieve their goods were hurt
and a victim, who could not control himself, threw himself into
the fire in his shop and was burnt to death.
</P>
<P>
Describing Monday as "the saddest day of my life", State
Administrator Hamed Ali warned against looting, saying a
high powered panel will be set up to probe the incident.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, security operatives arrested more than
20 people for looting while one of the looters was killed by
people at the market.
</P>
<P>
Lorries that brought goods from the southern part of the
country were unable to discharge their loads due to the raging
fire.

<P>
ANKARA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Itzhak Mordechai is to visit Turkey from November 8 to 10 to
further strengthen their military ties.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day visit, Mordechai will exchange views
with Turkish government and army leaders over a number of key
defense issues, local newspaper Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli defense minister is also expected to discuss
with Turkish officials the details and exact date of the
controversial Israeli-Turkish-U.S. naval exercises.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted senior Turkish defense sources, who declined
to be named, as saying that Mordechai will also urge Ankara
to replace its tank units with Israeli-made Merkava-3 tanks.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai will be the second high-ranking defense official to
visit Turkey in the last two months after Israeli Defense
Forces Chief of Staff Amnon Shahak.
</P>
<P>
The increasing Turkish-Israeli military cooperation has greatly
disturbed the Arab countries as they believe that the close
cooperation is posing a threat to the security of the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkey has repeatedly stated that the Turkish-Israeli
cooperation is not directed against any other countries.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Daily Urges to Solve Iraq-US Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 11 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian daily here today
urged the international society to help solve the current
Iraq- U.S. crisis through political rather than military means.
</P>
<P>
Due to the urgency and proximity of this crisis, Iran has
announced its opposition to any military attack on the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq, the daily Iran
News said in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
The daily, which is believed to be close to the Iranian
Foreign Ministry, said that the ongoing Iraq-U.S. conflict "has
turned into a full-fledged crisis with dire consequences not
only for those who are directly involved, but also for the
whole region and the world at large."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Baghdad announced to reject Americans to
join the U.N. disarmament missions in Iraq, triggering a
new crisis between Iraq and the U.S. and the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the U.S. resumption of U-2 intelligence gathering
flights over Iraq, Iran News also urged the U.N. Security
Council to choose a better way to end the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council must realize that military action is
not the way to bring Iraq around," the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Iranian deputy foreign minister for Arab-African affairs Mohammad
Sadr Sunday voiced the country's opposition to any U.S. military
action against Iraq, urging Baghdad not to give any excuse to
the U.S. to take military actions.

</P>
<P>
He was greeted by Kuwaiti first Deputy Prime Minister and

<P>
During his one-day stay here, Kharazi is expected to hold

</P>
<P>
His Gulf tour, which already took him to Saudi Arabia and

is the first since he took office last August.
</P>
<P>
Kharazi expressed satisfaction Monday with the outcome of the

Arabia.
</P>

his visit there that Iran and Saudi Arabia asserted, as a
result of the talks, that they have common understanding of
regional affairs and their roots, according to Kuwait News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said that the talks covered bilateral ties, Islamic and
Arab ties, the Middle East, the Israeli-Turkish military
cooperation and the Turkish intervention in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He also said he agreed with the Saudi officials to develop
cooperation at the political, economic and cultural levels,
expressing hope that a higher Iranian-Saudi committee would be
formed to follow up sticking issues of bilateral concern.
</P>
<P>
Kharazi also conveyed two letters from the Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami to King Fahd the Crown Prince dealing
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Kharazi acknowledged that the Iranian-GCC relations have been
marred with some problems and asserted that coordination was
necessary to resolve them.
</P>
<P>
But he praised positive overtures made by the GCC states
towards the Iranian new president.
</P>
<P>
He reasserted that his Gulf tour was designed to "create an
adequate atmosphere to strengthen confidence and underscore the
desire of the Iranian government to open a new chapter in the
relations and cooperation with all GCC states."

<P>
LUSAKA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) will promote sustained improvements in the
survival, development and welfare of Zambian women and children
during the year 1997 to 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to an UNICEF program available here today, it will
address not only the immediate needs of the children, but also to
develop strategies to address the underlying causes of these
problems.
</P>
<P>
It will take actions to position the children and women at the
centre of Zambia's reform and development agenda, to increase
their access to quality services and to strengthen community and
family capacities to protect and care for the children.
</P>
<P>
It plans to halt the increasing infant and young child
mortality and stabilize the under five mortality rate below 200
per 1,000 live births.
</P>
<P>
Infant mortality rates in the country have risen to 113 from
80 per 1,000 live births since the 1980's and under five
mortality rates have increased from 150 to 202 per 1,000.
</P>
<P>
The figures are expected to swell by as much as 20 and 45
percent respectively by the year 2,000 due to rising HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
These rates, combined with increased adult deaths due to AIDS
related illnesses, have resulted in a drop in adult life
expectancy from 54 years in the mid 1980's to 45.5 in the 1990's.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Shen Guofang said that the US House of Representatives,
in disregard of international law and basic norms governing
international relations, has passed recently a series of bills
with anti-China contents and grossly interfered in China's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
"We hereby express our firm opposition and strong displeasure,"
said Shen when asked to comment on this issue here this afternoon
at a routine press conference.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that it should be pointed out that there are always
some people in the US Congress who are uncomfortable with better
Sino-American relations and closer friendly exchanges between the
two peoples.
</P>
<P>
"Every time the relationship gets better, they will go out of
their way to make trouble and erect obstacles. Yet history has
proved, and will continue to prove the futility of their
attempts," added Shen.

<HEADLINE> New Vaccine Against Cancer Tested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, November 11 (Xinhua)-- A promising new vaccine which
is expected to kill cancer cells is now being tested at Oslo's
Radium Hospital, according to a recent report from Norway.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 patients suffering from cancer of the colon or the
pancreas have been treated with the vaccine. For about half of
this group, it appears to have led to promising results.
</P>
<P>
The vaccine aimed to strengthen the immunity mechanisms of
cancer patients who have already undergone surgery and to kill the
cancerous cells which can cause the disease to spread. This method
has the advantage over traditional follow-up treatments like
radiation in that it has no side affects.
</P>
<P>
The vaccine, which was developed in Norway, is injected
directly beneath the skin where it activates the skin's immune
cells, causing them to alert the entire immune system and thereby
trigger an all-out attack on the cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
Gustav Gaudernack, senior researcher at the hospital and leader
for the vaccine program, said the method was still at the
experimental stage, but they had already got firm proof that the
vaccine causes cancer cells to die.
</P>
<P>
Next year, tests will begin with new and much bigger patient
groups, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the longer term, the team hopes to develop a preventive
vaccine, enabling people in special high-risk groups to be
vaccinated at an early age.
</P>
<P>
"This could perhaps halt the disease before it breaks out,"
said Gaudernack.

SINGAPORE, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Share prices rallied on the
Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index
rose by 20.41 points to close at 1684.1 points today.

valued at 226.25 million Singapore dollars (about 144.11 million
US dollars). Advances overtook declines by 208 to 132, while 271
other counters remained unchanged.

Singapore Technology Industrial Corporation (STIC) was the most
actively traded counter as it registered a turnover of 7.31
million units. It was followed by ERL which had 4.89 million

<HEADLINE> Uzbekistan Not to Go Against Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Uzbekistan wants to have good
relations with the United States but "it is by no means directed
against Russia," Uzbek President Islam Karimov said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Russian newspaper Izvestia published
Tuesday, Karimov said "we are no iceberg to drift. We have a ship,
there is a rudder and sail. They are controllable."
</P>
<P>
He said this in response to accusation of "drifting aside."
</P>
<P>
The Uzbek president is sure that his country has not lost
interest in Russia. "Uzbeks cannot be torn away from the Russian
people, Russian culture, Russian civilization, Russian history,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to economic relations with Russia, Karimov said
Uzbekistan wants to trade with its northern neighbor not through
barter but as with a civilized country which has hard currency.
</P>
<P>
Karimov emphasized that Uzbekistan is not putting forward
"ambitious tasks or joining the Group-7, or Group-8 or anything
else." "We are patiently building our own potential," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about development of state patterns, the president said
"Uzbekistan follows the Uzbek pattern," that is "to restore
everything great in the ancient culture of our ancestors, combine
the great legacy with the achievements of world civilization and
use enormous natural and intellectual resources."

<HEADLINE> Two Key U.S. Senators Back NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Two key senators of the
United States said today after a series of hearings that expanding
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was the correct
policy for Washington to pursue.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Senate colleagues, Jesse Helms, chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Joseph Biden, the ranking
Democrat, expressed their views on bringing new members into the
16-nation NATO.
</P>
<P>
"We are persuaded the overwhelming weight of testimony
reinforces the argument for NATO enlargement," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
The two senators said they expected the costs of NATO
enlargement to be "relatively small for the U.S. and affordable
for new and current European allies."
</P>
<P>
They cited testimony by Clinton administration officials that
the cost is likely to be less than the Pentagon projected in
February because the military infrastructure in these countries is
in better condition than previously estimated.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon estimated that total expansion cost from 1997 to
2007 would be between 27 billion and 35 billion dollars, with
U.S. costs in the range of 1.5 billion to two billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The hearings "helped to ease concerns on various points related
to relations with Russia," which vigorously opposed enlargement of
the alliance to its eastern border by including three former
Warsaw pact members, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The new NATO-Russia Joint Council, established to make
enlargement more palatable to Moscow, "will have no undue
influence or veto" over NATO decisions.
</P>
<P>
NATO leaders agreed to accept Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic by 1999 as full members. The agreement needs to be
ratified by the Senate with a two-thirds majority vote.

<P>
BRASILIA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso and his Argentine counterpart Carlos Menem said
here today that they enjoy the good bilateral relations and desire
to achieve "an alliance for an admirable integration."
</P>
<P>
In a communique, Cardoso and Menem said that it is important to
cooperate in nuclear energy, electrical power, education, culture,
technology and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
They said that education will be a central theme in the 2nd
Summit of the Americas to be held in Santiago, Chile, in 1998 and
stressed the necessity of cooperation among countries to attach
importance to this sector.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents signed three declarations on cooperation in
the Southern Common Market (Mercosur), nuclear control and land
mines control.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso and Menem also signed agreements on educational
cooperation through telecommunication technology, the control of
the Sao Borja-Santo Tome border and creation of a commission for
the development and cooperation on border areas.
</P>
<P>
Menem arrived here today for a two-day visit, after taking part
in the 7th Ibero-American Summit in the Margarita Island, Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Brazil and Argentina are two major partners in the Mercosur
which also consists of Uruguay and Paraguay. Trade between the
them rose from 3 billion U.S. dollars in 1991 to 12 billion
dollars in 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic is ready
to pay for its North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
membership and participate in peace-keeping in Bosnia after June
1998, Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference after meeting with U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright, Klaus acknowledged there was "no room
for free riding" in joining NATO.
</P>
<P>
The Czech government's military spending in 1998 would total
230 million U.S. dollars -- 200 million for its armed forces and
30 million for NATO operating costs, Klaus said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We know it's impossible to be consumers of collective
security. We have to be producers as well."
</P>
<P>
In July, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland were invited to
join NATO, with the Czech Republic however reportedly lagging
behind the other two in preparations for the move.
</P>
<P>
During his week-long trip here, Klaus also met other senior
U.S. officials, Congress members and businessmen.

<HEADLINE> Peacekeepers Should Avoid Domestic Affairs: Qin Huasun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- China said today that
although peacekeeping operations have increasingly dealt with
countries' internal conflicts in recent years, that should not be
used as an excuse to interfere in the internal affairs of these
countries.
</P>
<P>
This was expounded by Qin Huasun, permanent representative of
China to the United Nations. He was speaking at the Fourth
Committee (Special Political and Neocolonization) of the
U.N. General Assembly on the agenda of peacekeeping operations,
today.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council should strengthen its guidance and
supervision over multinational forces to prevent and stop any act
that goes beyond the mandate given by the Council, and jeopardizes
the reputation and image of the United Nations, Qin said.
</P>
<P>
He said a necessary and stable financial basis is essential to
the success of any peacekeeping operation. The the withholding of
peacekeeping assessments by Member States, in particular some
major contributors, has seriously dampened the enthusiasm of
troop-contributing countries.
</P>
<P>
He called on the concerned countries to rapidly clear their
arrears, in full and without conditions.
</P>
<P>
Qin said enhancing the rapid-deployment capacity of
peacekeeping operations is important in effectively implementing
the relevant resolutions of the Council and preventing situations
from getting out of control.
</P>
<P>
China supports U.N. efforts to enhance stand-by
arrangements and announced last May its readiness to participate
in them, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
As the President of the Security Council this month, Qin said,
China will continue to urge the Council to devote more time to
discussing and resolving African issues. China hoped the U.N. will
provide more assistance to African countries and organizations to
enhance Africa's capacity to prevent and resolve conflicts
on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Peace and development are the two major issues in today's
world, Qin said. Many conflicts in the world were, in
the final analysis, caused by the question of development.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. should make great efforts to promote development and
help lift developing countries, particularly the least developed
nations, out of poverty as the only way to truly prevent conflicts
and secure an environment of long-term stability and peace, Qin
said.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Daily Urges to Solve Iraq-US Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 11 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian daily here today
urged the international society to help solve the current
Iraq- U.S. crisis through political rather than military means.
</P>
<P>
Due to the urgency and proximity of this crisis, Iran has
announced its opposition to any military attack on the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq, the daily Iran
News said in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
The daily, which is believed to be close to the Iranian
Foreign Ministry, said that the ongoing Iraq-U.S. conflict "has
turned into a full-fledged crisis with dire consequences not
only for those who are directly involved, but also for the
whole region and the world at large."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Baghdad announced to reject Americans to
join the U.N. disarmament missions in Iraq, triggering a
new crisis between Iraq and the U.S. and the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the U.S. resumption of U-2 intelligence gathering
flights over Iraq, Iran News also urged the U.N. Security
Council to choose a better way to end the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council must realize that military action is
not the way to bring Iraq around," the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Iranian deputy foreign minister for Arab-African affairs Mohammad
Sadr Sunday voiced the country's opposition to any U.S. military
action against Iraq, urging Baghdad not to give any excuse to
the U.S. to take military actions.

<HEADLINE> Chile's Fish Exports Grow by 7.1 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Chile's fish exports amounted
to 1.43 billion U.S. dollars during the first nine months this
year, up 7.1 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The National Society of Fishing said the figure slightly
outgrows projections made for the year.
</P>
<P>
It said the outcome is due to the high captures achieved in the
northern coast, the stable high price of fish meal and the strong
start of salmon fishing over the last quarter.
</P>
<P>
The society termed as "relative" the impact of the "El Nino"
phenomenon in the fishing industry. In the northern zone, the
capture of anchovy increased by 48 percent, while in the
mid-southern zone, captures of saurel dropped by 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Nonetheless, the latter figure is compensated by captures of
other species like sardines and anchovy, a better production of
canned saurel and the best price of fish meal," it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The financial crisis
originating from Southeast Asia would mean a slowdown in world
economic growth perhaps by as much as one percentage point, a
high-ranking U.N. official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the U.N. Economic and Financial Committee, Secretary
General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD) Rubens Ricupero said that for the first time a crisis
originating in the developing world has had a profound impact on
capital markets of the North.
</P>
<P>
"No one is immune from the effects of actions taken or not
taken in another country or on the other side of the globe," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the Asian financial crisis is firmly located
in the private sector and revolved around market rather than
government failure.
</P>
<P>
However, Ricupero said, the immediate danger is the
overreaction by policy-makers, as unduly heavy-handed
macroeconomic response could set back reform efforts in developing
countries for the foreseeable future.

<HEADLINE> Apple Unveils New Models </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Apple Computer Inc. today
introduced a new family of computers.
</P>
<P>
Fighting back from stubborn losses and an unsatisfactory market
share, the computer maker has introduced a next-generation family
called the Power Macintosh G3. It is based on the fastest
available personal computer processors, with increased performance
and a lower cost, starting at around 2,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The new desk-top and lap-top computers Apple unveiled today use a
new version of the PowerPC microprocessors that run at speeds of
233 and 266 megahertz, and are comparable to the newest Pentium II
processors from Intel Corp.
</P>
<P>
Apple Computer Inc. pioneered the commercial personal computer
in the late 1970s and made computing easy with the Macintosh in
the mid-1980s. But the company was hammered by the growing
popularity of Windows-based computers, and suffered alarming
losses to its bottom line and market share.
</P>
<P>
The company has gone through several reorganizations and bouts
of cost-cutting. Since July, Apple has drastically restricted the
ability of other computer makers to clone Macs, and forged an
alliance with longtime rival, Microsoft.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Announces New Package of Economic Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian government today
announced a series of new economic measures, aiming to cut public
spending, raise taxes, stabilize financial market and attract more
foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
A package of 51 measures is expected to increase 20 billion
U.S. dollars in revenue for the country, and maintain the
stability of the Brazilian currency to avoid high inflation.
</P>
<P>
The package will reduce 15 percent of administrative spendings
and 6 percent of government's investment. But the measures will
not affect reforms of education, health, social welfare and
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
With the package, the government will lay off 33,000 workers to
save 5.2 billion dollars, and raise taxes of industrial products,
specially cars and beverages.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Brazilian President Fernando Cardoso said today that
it was important for his country to take such measures, for the
adjustments could defend a strong currency and prevent high
inflation rate from affecting the country again.
</P>
<P>
He admitted the measures will be a bitter pill for taxpayers,
but will not affect their daily life and incomes.
</P>
<P>
The package is another temporary move by the Brazilian
government after the Brazilian financial market was affected by
the turmoil in Asian markets. The Central Bank of Brazil increased
the monthly interest from 1.58 percent to 3.05 percent and sold
billions of dollars of its reserves to maintain the current
exchange rate between real and U.S. dollar.

WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A Pakistani man was
convicted today of killing two Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
employees in a 1993 shooting spree outside the agency's
headquarters and could receive the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
A 12-member Fairfax County jury deliberated for four hours
before finding Mir Aimal Kasi guilty of one count of capital
murder, another count of first-degree murder and three counts of
malicious wounding.
</P>
<P>
The penalty phase was to begin on Tuesday morning, Fairfax
Circuit Court Judge J. Howe Brown announced. The 33-year Kasi,
captured in June in Pakistan by the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI), could face death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Kasi was found guilty of shooting to death Frank Darling, a
28-year-old covert operative for the CIA, and Lansing Bennett, a
66-year-old physician and intelligence analyst. He was also
convicted of wounding two other CIA workers and an employee of a
CIA contractor.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani walked amid stopped cars in morning rush-hour
traffic outside the CIA compound on January 25, 1993, firing at
people inside them with an AK-47 assault rifle, the prosecutors
said.
</P>
<P>
During the trial, prosecutors said Kasi was out to avenge
American bombing of Iraq during the Persian Gulf War and American
meddling in Muslim nations of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Kasi showed no motion as the verdict was read today.

Since its establishment in 1987, the center has rescued the

<HEADLINE> Steady Commodity Market in Fourth Quarter Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- China's commodity market will
maintain a steady growth momentum in the fourth quarter of this
year, according to predictions made by the Chinese Ministry of
Internal Trade.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Commodity Circulation Department of the
ministry predicted that China's commodity retail sales will post
2.38 trillion yuan (286.7 billion U.S. dollars) this year,
increasing by 12 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, prices of the country's major
commodities will report an overall decrease, compared to the same
period of last year. The officials said the rising margin of
China's retail price will be controlled to under two percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
The market of industrial products for daily use is expected to
remain stable in the last three months of this year, with only the
sales of clothing to show increase by a bigger margin.
</P>
<P>
As for non-staple food, the production of pork, which ranks
first in China's meat consumption, will register a notable climb,
with an estimated 65.4 million hogs to be slaughtered in the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
The ministry forecast China's sugar output in the 1997-1998
period would stand at from 7 to 7.2 million tons, which may result
in a sagging sugar price next year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China will have an ample vegetable supply this
winter, the ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Prefer Movies to TV, Survey Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Watching movies in a theatre
is still the most popular entertainment for most Chinese citizens,
a recent survey conducted in five cities has concluded.
</P>
<P>
The Horizon Market Survey and Analysis Company, a
non-governmental Beijing-based research company, randomly surveyed
1,524 Chinese citizens in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xiamen and
Chongqing, and found that 46.9 percent of those questioned regard
going to the movies as their favorite form of entertainment. The
figure is 12 percent higher than for those who prefer watching TV.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile less than 10 percent of those surveyed say they often
watch movies, which shows that the market status of Chinese-made
movies is not flourishing, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Most of those who do not like watching domestic movies choose
more convenient and simpler forms of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese have long criticized the relatively high ticket
price and low quality of Chinese-made movies.

NPC.
</P>
<P>
The draft of the Detailed Election Method was presented to the
plenary session of the Election Conference this afternoon by the

formulated by the Presidium according to the Method for Electing
Deputies of the HKSAR of the PRC to the Ninth NPC adopted at the
Fifth Session of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee in March.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the Detailed Election Method is to set out in
detail some specific operating procedures of the election process,
 so as to facilitate the election of deputies to the Ninth NPC, he
 added.
</P>
<P>
Tung explained the provisions with regard to the nomination of
candidates for deputies, the preliminary election and the

Conference for Electing Deputies of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region to the Ninth National People's Congress of
China today presented a draft of the Detailed Election Method to
the plenary session of the Election Conference for discussion.
</P>
<P>
According to the 16-article draft, the number of deputies to be
 elected in the HKSAR to the Ninth NPC is 36, and the NPC deputies
 to be elected in the HKSAR must be Chinese citizens among HKSAR
residents who are 18 years old or above.
</P>
<P>
Candidates for the NPC deputies must be nominated jointly by at
 least 10 members of the Election conference by filling in the
Nomination Letter.

<P>
The Presidium of the Election Conference will make public the
list of candidates for deputies to the Ninth NPC and distribute it
 to every member of the Election Conference.
</P>
<P>
The election is selective with the number of candidates for
deputies to the Ninth NPC exceeding the number to be elected by
from one-fifth to one-half. When the number of nominees exceeds
the number to be elected by more than one-half, there will be a
preliminary round of balloting to narrow the gap.
</P>
<P>
The Election Conference elects the deputies through secret
balloting, and each member of the Election Conference can select
no more than 36 among the nominees. Candidates are elected on the
merit of votes.
</P>

The Election Conference will have two chief scrutineers and six
 scrutineers to supervise the distribution, casting and counting
of the ballots.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Election Conference are not allowed to entrust
others to cast ballots on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
The election result will be announced by the Presidium and
reported to the Credentials Commission of the NPC Standing
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The election date is set on December 8. If a preliminary round
of balloting is called for, it will take place on December
6.

MANILA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
drawn up a special incentive package to sustain the growth
momentum of the country's electronics industry, the country's
biggest foreign reserves earner, the local press reports said
today.
</P>
<P>
The package forms part of an eight-point strategy entitled
Philippines Electronics Sector Masterplan, which was recently
approved by the Cabinet, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Foremost in the plan is the creation of a world class science
park which will house world class communications, transport,
power, water and social facilities for the electronics sector.
</P>
<P>
The plan also calls for revisions to the education system for
technology and management students, and implementation of an
upgrade program to encourage multinational firms to assist local
companies to move up the technology ladder.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the plan also urges modification in the ways
investors work with government agencies by streamlining and
simplifying procedures.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Secretary Cesar Bautisa expected the plan to
significantly improve the overall attractiveness of the
Philippines as a regional manufacturing base.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines' exports of electronics products have grown at
an average of over 35 percent annually since 1990, and reached
10.2 billion U.S. dollars in 1996 or nearly two-thirds of the
country's total export earnings that year.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Wants APEC to Name New Members At Vancouver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister
Ali Alatas said Indonesia anticipates that the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders' meeting to be held in
Vancouver, Canada, late this month will name new members of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from setting up criteria for electing new members, I
believe that the summit will be more productive if, based on this,
new members are named," Alatas said here last night.
</P>
<P>
The issue of selecting new APEC members has become increasing
difficult as several members believe that APEC will become
inefficient if it has too many members, officials at the Foreign
Ministry today quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
After last year's meeting in Manila, ministers agreed to
establish conventions for selecting new members, and said their
decision would be announced at next year's meeting in Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
But, Alatas said some APEC members, including Indonesia, want
this decision to be acted upon at the Vancouver meeting and
officiated in the following Kuala Lumpur meeting, adding that as
yet, there has been no agreement on the proposal.
</P>
<P>
At least 11 countries want to join APEC, including Vietnam,
Russia, Peru, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
APEC consists of 18 members -- Australia, Brunei, Canada,
China, Chile, Hong Kong (China), Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia,
Mexico, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, New Zealand, Singapore,
South Korea, Chinese Taipei, Thailand and the United States.

this year than the same month last year, said Statistics NZ in a
media release received today.
</P>
<P>
Motels recorded an occupancy rate of 45.6 percent in September,
the highest rate of any of the accommodation types surveyed. But
the figure was still below the rate of 52.3 percent in September
1996.

<P>
The occupancy rate for hotels was 45.0 percent in September,
down from 49.0 percent for the same month one year ago.

Regionally, Auckland and Wellington shared the highest overall
occupancy rate of 42.5 percent in the month, while Northland
recorded the lowest rate of 14.5 percent, Statistics NZ said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Cuts Fertilizer Purchase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Ministry of
Agriculture and Cooperatives has decided to cut by nearly half the
amount of chemical fertilizers it planned to buy for the next crop
year, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after Chucheep Harnsawat, who earlier
this year ordered the purchase of one million tons of fertilizers
for the coming crop year, was stepping down last weekend as head
of the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that it will buy only 439,000 tons of three
formulae of fertilizers that farmers urgently need, according to
the reports.
</P>
<P>
The three formulae are the fertilizers with nitrogen,
phosphorous and potassium contents at the ratios of 16-20-0,
16-16-8, and 15-15-15, which are mainly used by rice farmers, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
However, the terms and conditions for the bidding will remain
unchanged, the ministry noted.
</P>
<P>
The cutback was prompted by baht fluctuations and budget
shortfalls, it added.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also said that it will call another round of
bidding if the country's financial situation improves and the new
government wants to procure one million tons of fertilizers.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Public Health
Ministry has given tobacco manufacturers and importers one year
grace period for them to change health warning labels on cigarette
packages.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has required tobacco makers and importers in the
country to print the warning in the Thai language in white letters
on a black background, the Bangkok Post said today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also demanded that the warnings should be placed
on the top half of the pack and cover at least one-third of the
pack, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Currently most cigarettes made in Thailand or imported bear the
warnings printed in black on a white background on the package.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Public Health Ministry issued a ministerial
announcement on October 15 for the change.
</P>
<P>
The ministry recently recommended ten warnings for tobacco
makers and importers, including 'cigarette smoking kills',
'cigarette smoking causes lung cancer', 'cigarette smoking causes
early aging', and 'cigarette smoking is harmful to people near you
and children in the womb', the newspaper said.

<P>
DHAKA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- About 34 well-known French
companies will exhibit their products and technologies in a long
trade show that is taking place as part of a gala French Week in
Dhaka from November 23 to 25, the independent United News of

</P>
<P>
A week-long French food festival, fashion show and two seminars

Dhaka by French companies seeking to establish closer business
links with Bangladesh, UNB said.
</P>
<P>
The prime objective of the trade show is to encourage the
French companies to do more business in Bangladesh in order to
narrow the present trade imbalance against France, officials from
the France-Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industry were quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
During the first eight months of this year, Bangladesh's
exports to France totaled 228 million U.S. dollars while its
imports from the European country valued at 63 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's imports from France was picking up since 1993, but
the import figures declined during the January-August 1997 period.
French imports from Bangladesh, however, showed a almost steady
growth.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's 9-month Wine Imports Drop 20 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's imports of wine
totaled 540,000 cases during the first nine months of this year,
down 22 percent compared with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics by the Thai Customs
Department, even imported samples of wine priced at 50 to 70 baht
(1.35 to 1.9 U.S. dollars) also declined significantly during the
period of this year.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's total wine imports for this year are expected at 700
to 800 million baht (19 to 21.6 million dollars), also will
decrease by 20 percent compared with last year, the department
said.
</P>
<P>
The decrease in wine imports was attributed to the country's
economic slowdown and the government's higher tax policies, which
pinched the purchasing power of consumers, the department said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government earlier this year raised the excise tax on
wine from 40 percent to 50 percent and the value added tax from 7
percent to 10 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Singapore is expecting
container throughput at its port to break the 14 million TEU
(twenty-foot equivalent unit) mark this year, as container
throughput increased by 8.95 percent in the first nine months of
the year.
</P>
<P>
According to local industrial sources today, the latest
statistics published by the Maritime and Port Authority of
Singapore (MPA), container throughput for the first nine months of
this year totaled 10.45 million TEUs, up from 9.59 million TEUs
compared with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Assuming the same rate of increase is sustained for the
remainder of the year, the Port of Singapore will surpass the 14
million TEU mark by the end of the year, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Last year the Port of Singapore registered a record container
throughput of 12.9 million TEUs, making it the world's second
largest container port behind Hong Kong with 13.5 million TEUs.
</P>
<P>
Continued growth in container throughput at the port, which
comes largely from transshipment to and from the region, indicates
that trade has not been hit by the recent economic turmoil in
Asia, the sources said.

<P>
NEW DELHI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States-based
world leading automotive company, General Motors (GM), has planned
to enter the small car market in India, The Observer of Business
and Politics reported today.
</P>
<P>
Disclosing this at a function organized by the Confederation of
Indian Industries (CII) here on Monday, GM chairman John F. Smith

GM international operations president Louis R. Huges said that

</P>
<P>
"You can't have a major presence in India with one vehicle and,
therefore, you will see additions in our presence here by way of a
smaller vehicle and a larger vehicle," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Smith, in 1997, GM's combined operations in India
will have invested about 300 million U.S. dollars in the country.
These investments include everything from autos to auto parts,
software and satellites, financial services and locomotives and
advanced radar systems.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Banks to Give Loan to Dhaka's Private Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Bank (BB) has
finalized modalities for a two-billion-taka (about 44.64 U.S.
dollars) industrial development fund to be used by the foreign
banks to boost term loans for the private sector in the country,
according to a BB circular today.
</P>
<P>
"All foreign commercial banks will provide medium and long term
loans to medium and large scale industries in addition to their
present level of industrial financing," the circular stated.
</P>
<P>
"To supplement this additional industrial credit, it has been
decided that the Bangladesh Bank (central bank) will provide
re-finance to the financing banks."
</P>
<P>
The foreign banks in Bangladesh will disburse loans from their
own resources and claim half of the amount disbursed as re-finance
from the central bank, the circular said, adding that the banks
will get the money from the BB at the bank rate.
</P>
<P>
This move to create the special fund was taken last month by
Finance Minister SAMS Kibria amidst allegations by the businessmen
that they could not get long-term loans from banks.
</P>
<P>
As 50 percent of the total loans will be provided from the
special fund, the total amount to be invested under the special
scheme will be 40 billion taka (about 89.28 million dollars), the
circular noted.
</P>
<P>
The BB has stressed that loans from the special fund should be
given on a priority basis to manufacturing industries in the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
Joint venture enterprises including local subsidiaries of
international companies will also be eligible for this fund.
</P>
<P>
The re-financing to the foreign banks will be for a period of
two to seven years, depending on the tenure of the loan sanctioned
to each individual project, the circular added.
</P>
<P>
The foreign banks will have to repay the money to the central
bank in installments which will be fixed for each individual
withdrawal of funds, according to the modalities.
</P>
<P>
A grace period will be given to the banks for repayment of the
money, but banks will have to pay interests on the loans for the
grace period.
</P>
<P>
After the expiry of the grace period, the central bank will
recover the money on quarterly basis, starting from the date on
which the grace period expires, the circular said.

<HEADLINE> India to Discuss Competitive Devaluation Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 11 (XINHUA) -- Competitive devaluation as a
policy option in the wake of the Southeast Asian currency crisis,
and other factors hitting exports are expected to be discussed at
a review meeting Wednesday, an official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be chaired by Prime Minister Inder Kumar
Gujral and attended by some ministers concerned.
</P>
<P>
The government fears an export crisis in the coming months,
with at least three factors acting in conjunction- a sharp fall in
the premium on special import licenses (SIL), the sharp
devaluation of the currencies of competing exporters and the
threat to the country's export schemes by the European Union's
charge that they offer excessive and unfair subsidies.
</P>
<P>
Even going by optimistic projections, the export targets for
1997-98 financial year for major sectors like agricultural
products, gems and jewelry, and textiles and garments are likely
to be missed, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The three sectors cumulatively account for more than half of
Indian exports, with agriculture contributing 19 percent, gems and
jewelry 17 percent and textiles and garments 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The huge devaluation by several competing countries and their
ability to undercut prices by almost 10-15 percent is expected to
hurt the overall growth rate. The Pakistani rupee's fall to 42
rupees per U.S. dollar from 34 rupees a dollar a few months ago is
hurting India's rice exports. India has predicted that textiles,
chemicals, agricultural products, particularly marine products and
rice would be hit further in future.

DHAKA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- A two-day South Asian conference
on refugees and migratory movements began here Monday, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of India, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and
Bangladesh attended the conference. In the past five decades, the
South Asian region witnessed mass involuntary movements of 35
million to 40 million people.
</P>
<P>
The conference is being held under the auspices of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees with wide participation of
"eminent persons" groups who work closely with the UN body in
their respective countries, the Daily Star said.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Star added that the region experienced many migratory
movements including the Indo-Pakistan refugee flow in 1947, which
was the largest international flow in the world history.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad told the
conference that "Bangladesh has been both a country of origin and
also a generous enough country for asylum."
</P>
<P>
"We, therefore, have a clear perspective of the issue and all
that it involves," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are not a party to the 1951 Refugee Convention or its 1967
Protocol. No country from South Asia has yet become a party," the
minister noted, adding "however, we do attach importance to both
these documents and strive to ensure that our activities and
attitude conform to their provisions."

<P>
CANBERRA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar edged
higher in trade today but a lack of incentives left it to close
just shy of 70.00 US cents.
</P>
<P>
The local unit settled at 69.94 US cents, from 69.58
previously.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the currency had received an early boost in a
quiet market from some local buying this morning.
</P>
<P>
"It was a bit of a short market and we saw a short squeeze,"
Commonwealth Bank corporate foreign exchange senior manager
Stavros Nitis said.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the focus remained on global sharemarkets and, in
particular, those in the Southeast Asian region.
</P>
<P>
As a result, a strengthening Australian Stock Exchange and Hong
Kong bourse also helped the local unit higher today.
</P>
<P>
The market had been wary this morning, expecting Friday's
decline on Wall Street would translate into a weaker equity market
here.
</P>
<P>
On the Australian Stock Exchange today the all ordinaries index
closed up 2.4 points at 2524.0, after losing some ground earlier
in the session.
</P>
<P>
In late trading in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index was up 101.81
points at 10094.65, after trading to an earlier high of 10251.65.
</P>
<P>
However, local traders said the sustained rises on the
sharemarkets still had to be seen and downside pressure remained
on the Australian dollar due to the Southeast Asian turmoil.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Britain Reaffirms Tough Stance Towards Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary
George Robertson reaffirmed here today Britain's tough stance
towards Iraq, saying Baghdad's banning of American arms inspectors
was "a step too far."
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government has decided to ban American experts from
taking part in an arms inspection team of the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) on Iraq, accusing them of undertaking spy
activities on behalf of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Robertson told reporters early today that Britain's Labor
government would ensure that "the world community's view is
delivered to Saddam Hussein in the toughest and most robust way
that is possible."
</P>
<P>
"I think he (Saddam Hussein) realises now in Baghdad that the
world community is united. This was a step too far and UNSCOM
inspectors must be allowed to do their job unhindered by his
intransigence," he said.
</P>
<P>
The British Defense Secretary, who refused to rule out the
possibility of using military means to resolve the current crisis,
said: "We are not talking about any of the options we are
considering."
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair Sunday pledged his support
for the United States in its row with Iraq over the UN arms
inspection in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Blair said in his letter to President Bill Clinton: "I have no
doubt that, as in the past, we must stand absolutely firm and
absolutely together."

<HEADLINE> U.S. President Decides to Shelve "Fast-Track" Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives put off the decisive vote over "fast-track" trade
bill at the request of President Bill Clinton, a major political
defeat for the White House this year.
</P>
<P>
Due to lack of support from his own party, Clinton told House
Speaker Newt Gingrich in a telephone call this morning to drop
efforts to pass the so-called "fast track" bill. It means that
there will be another difficult battle for the legislation next
year.
</P>
<P>
The decision came after the House stayed in session past
midnight in an unsuccessful attempt to gather enough votes.
</P>
<P>
"The president will be committed to opening markets overseas
using whatever tools are available to him," stated White House
spokesman Mike McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
House GOP leaders said the president was informed late Sunday
night that he was about a half-dozen votes short of winning, but
that they gave him the final say on whether to "pull" the bill.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time over the past week Clinton had requested
a delay.
</P>
<P>
Critics, including labor unions and environmental groups, argue
it does not do enough to require presidents to consider wages,
working conditions and environmental standards when dealing with
the U.S. overseas trading partners.
</P>
<P>
Most Republicans and corporate America support the measure.
</P>
<P>
The "fast-track" authority allows Congress to simply approve or
reject trade agreements negotiated by the administration, but not
amend them. The administration wanted the power to accelerated the
procedures for a proposed free-trade pact with Chile, and to enter
into other new trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Presidents, for decades, have had the authority, but it
has lapsed.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Senate Vote on Civil Rights Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Monday appealed to the full Senate to vote on the nomination of
Bill Lann Lee to head the Justice Department's civil rights
division.
</P>
<P>
With Lee alongside him at a White House conference on hate
crimes, Clinton said the Senate Judiciary Committee should not
kill Lee's nomination as assistant attorney general for civil
rights because he supports affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
"It is wrong to deny this man that job because he agrees with
the policies of his president on that issue," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"With all respect, if we have to wait until we get a head of
the civil rights division who is opposed to affirmative action,
that job will be vacant for a very long time," he said.
</P>
<P>
Senator Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee
and a Republican, said on Sunday that as far as right now Lee's
nomination is dead. Clinton asked that Hatch send the nomination
forward for a vote anyway, without a committee recommendation.
</P>
<P>
"Let all 100 senators stand up and be counted in the full view
of the American people," Clinton said at the conference.
</P>
<P>
Hatch rejected a request by committee Democrats for another
hearing so that Lee could answer charges that he has been an
advocate of racial and gender preferences.
</P>
<P>
Democrats on the Judiciary Committee last week sought the
further hearing and postponement of the vote on Lee when it became
apparent it would turn out 9-9. Tie votes count as a rejection.
</P>
<P>
Senator Patrick Leahy, a ranking Democrat on the Judiciary
Committee, accused Republicans of using Lee for political
purposes.
</P>
<P>
Republican leaders are out to please extremists in their party
who oppose relief when equal opportunity is denied to women or
minorities in the workplace, he said.

<HEADLINE> Significant Ceremonial Site Discovered in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- British archaeologists have
discovered evidence of a prehistoric ceremonial temple at least as
"old and significant" as Stonehenge, a stone monument built by
ancient Britons.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the ruins, thought to be 5,000 years old, was
described by English Heritage officials today as the most exciting
archaeological find in Britain for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Traces of the temple -- in well defined pits within a 135-meter
circular ditch -- were found after archaeologists used sensitive
ground-scanning instruments below an ancient site of Stone Circles
at Stanton Drew near the southwestern English port of Bristol, an
official at English Heritage said.
</P>
<P>
"(The find) is as old and comparable in significance to the
megalith monument at Stonehenge, although twice its size," an
official statement reported.
</P>
<P>
Officials said until now the site had been concealed by a
series of well-known stone circles.
</P>
<P>
Sir Jocelyn Stevens, chairman of English Heritage, the
government department responsible for preserving historic sites,
told a news conference he thought the complex structure was built
as a "symbol of power" by people seeking to control the
supernatural.
</P>
<P>
Geoffrey Wainwright, English Heritage's chief archaeologist,
said they have about 3,000 stone circles in Britain but previously
only seven timber temples. The Stanton Drew find is by far the
largest, twice as big as anything previously discovered.
</P>
<P>
Wainwright said that the timber temples were probably
constructed around 3,000 BC, pre-dating stone circles, such as
Stonehenge, which began around 2,500BC.

<HEADLINE> Baltic States Refuse Russia's Security Guarantee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 10 (Xinhua) -- At the meeting in Palanga,
Lithuani, the presidents of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia Monday
rebuffed security guarantees offered by Russia to the Baltic
states, according to the Interfax news service.
</P>
<P>
A trilateral communique said the policy of the three states is
based on the idea of the indivisibility of the European security
system and is therefore directed primarily at integration into the
European Union and NATO.
</P>
<P>
Such integration, in opinion of the presidents of the Baltic
states, should sufficiently strengthen security in Europe."The
invariable goal of our states is a strive to integrate into NATO
and the European Union", the document said.
</P>
<P>
However, the leaders of the Baltic states appreciated the
Russia's willingness expressed by president Boris Yeltsin to
expand neighborly relations and mutually beneficial cooperation
with Baltic states.
</P>
<P>
They were satisfied with Moscow's readiness to continue a
political dialogue with Tallinn, Vilnius and Riga on a bilateral
basis and within the framework of various international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that Baltic leaders welcomed the signing of
the Russian-Lithuanian border treaty, and the leaders of Estonia
and Latvia voiced readiness to sign similar treaties with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin offered the Baltic states
security guarantees in a statement handed to Lithuanian President
Algirdas Brazauskas on October 24 when he was visiting Moscow.
Later similar offers were sent to the leaders of Estonia and
Latvia.

<HEADLINE> Blair Pledges to Make Britain Pivot of New World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair pledged here today to make Britain not only a leader in
Europe but also "the pivot of this new world".
</P>
<P>
Speaking in his first major foreign policy speech since winning
the May election, Blair set out his vision of a new Britain and
vowed to increase the country's influence in the world.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot in these post-Empire days be a super-power in the
military sense. But we can make the British presence in the world
felt," he told the annual banquet given by the Lord Mayor of
London.
</P>
<P>
"With our historic alliances, we can be pivotal. We can be
powerful in our influence -- a nation to whom others listen," he
said, adding "It is my belief that far from being standing alone,
Britain can be the pivot of this new world."
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the "guiding light" of the new Labor government,
Blair stressed the following four pinciples: The first was to
restore Britain's leading position in Europe, the second was to
forge strong links with the United States, the third was to
maintain a strong defense capacity and the fourth was to place
emphasis on ethics, human rights and free trade.
</P>
<P>
On the single European currency, Blair, whose government has
ruled out Britain's first-wave membership of the euro, said that
Britain had to prepare now for the single currency ahead of entry
in the next parliament.
</P>
<P>
"A successful single currency would be good for the Europe. But
it will affect us in or out," he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Drastically Cut Military Jobs for Weaponry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen announced today a drastic plan to cut 25 percent of
the military civilian jobs and make business reforms to save 3.2
billion U.S. dollars a year for new weaponry.
</P>
<P>
At a Pentagon press conference with Vice President Al Gore,
Cohen also called on Congress to approve two new rounds of
domestic base closings in 2001 and 2005 to save another 2.8
billion dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders explained that recent cuts in defense spending
and the government's moves to balance the federal budget simply
did not leave enough money for the nation's arms modernization.
</P>
<P>
Under the personnel cuts and business reforms, the Pentagon
will cut 28,000 out of 141,000 civilian jobs in targeted defense
organizations in the next four years.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said he would reduce one-third of his own 3,000-member
office staff worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Among the groups affected in the cuts would be the secretariats
for policy, acquisition, finance, personnel and intelligence, as
well as agencies responsible for commissaries, security, financial
accounting and information services.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 120,000 civilian defense jobs would also be put up
for bids between private agencies and the government under the
plan.
</P>
<P>
The initiatives are part of an ongoing reassessment of defense
manpower and resources that began last spring with the Quadrennial
Defense Review. The QDR recommended modest cuts in military forces
and preserved all major arms procurement programs.
</P>
<P>
In the business reform, the Pentagon will vastly increase its
use of computers and the Internet, using "electronic catalogues"
for purchasing and seeking achievement within three years of
entirely paper-free contracting for all major weapon systems.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon will also streamline travel planning and household
goods transportation for military and civilian employees to save
an estimated 300 million dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Gore and Cohen conceded that it would be difficult to get
Congressional approval of the base closures, but Defense officials
said that virtually all of the other moves would be accomplished
without Congressional approval.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Home Prices Rise 5 Percent Nationally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. home sale prices
climbed up by 5 percent in the year ended in September, much
faster than inflation, with a handful of cities in the South and
Midwest reporting double-digit increases over the past year.
</P>
<P>
The nation-wide the median price of an existing home increased
5 percent over the year to 126,500 dollars, the National
Association of Realtors said today. Meanwhile, consumer prices
overall rose just 2.2 percent over that period.
</P>
<P>
Of 136 metropolitan areas surveyed by the association, only 13
reported declines. And three of the nation's four broad regions
reported price appreciation even greater than the national
average.
</P>
<P>
In the South, the median price rose 6.9 percent to 112,300
dollars; in the Midwest, 5.5 percent to 108,100 dollars; in the
West, 5.2 percent to 163,000 dollars, and in the Northeast, 3.4
percent to 147,400 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Waterloo of Iowa state, led the nation in price appreciation,
with values jumping 17.2 percent. It was followed by Kalamazoo,
Michigan, 14.5 percent; New Orleans and Fort Lauderdale, Florida,
both 11.3 percent, and Memphis, Tennessee, 11.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Norfolk, Virginia, had the sharpest decline, 11.9 percent. It
was followed by Honolulu, 6 percent; Beaumont, Texas, 4.4 percent;
El Paso, Texas, and Hartford, Connecticut, both 3.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The five metro areas with the highest median prices in the
July-September quarter were Honolulu, 315,000 dollars; San
Francisco, 300,600 dollars; Orange County, California, 233,000
dollars; New York, 212,500 dollars, and Boston, 204,400 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The five with the lowest prices were Ocala, Florida., 65,700
dollars; Beaumont, Texas, 67,100 dollars; Waterloo, Iowa, 68,200
dollars; Davenport, Iowa, 71,700 dollars, and Daytona Beach,
Florida, 73,600 dollars.

LONDON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
ended higher Monday, supported by Asian markets' only moderate
losses and Wall Street's early gains.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index managed to close the day above the
4,800-point level at 4,806.8, up 42.5 points after drifting during
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that calmer Asian markets and Wall Street's
moderate rally helped underpin market sentiment.
</P>
<P>
However, with the South Korean market still volatile, investors
remained cautious. Meanwhile, they were nervous ahead of this
Wednesday's US Federal Reserve's monetary meeting.
</P>
<P>
German shares in Frankfurt also ended sharply higher, with the
DAX-30 index up 52.64 points at 3,752.53, boosted by the firmer
dollar which is favorable for German exporters and by hopes that
Asian markets are starting to stabilise.
</P>
<P>
But dealers said that market sentiment remained fragile and
trading volumes were thin.

<HEADLINE> UK Labor to Hand Back F1 Chief's Donation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain's ruling Labor party
said today it would return a controversial donation from chief of
Formula One motor racing Bernie Ecclestone.
</P>
<P>
The party's general secretary Tom Sawyer told reporters a
donation from Ecclestone, president of the Formula One
Constructors Association, would be paid back.
</P>
<P>
He said the move was taken after consulting with Sir Patrick
Neill, Britain's official watchdog on political ethics.
</P>
<P>
Sir Patrick, chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public
Life, told Labor it would be wrong and unfair to criticize
Ecclestone's donation -- whose scale remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
But he recommended that in order to avoid even the appearance
of influence-peddling the money should be given back.
</P>
<P>
Although Ecclestone said he had never sought any favors from
the party or the government, question has been asked about links
between Labor and Formula One over the decision not to ban tobacco
advertisement.
</P>
<P>
Last week Tessa Jowell, a junior health minister, said the
pledge to ban Formula One tobacco sponsorship had been dropped as
a matter of "practical politics" because of the risk that the
sport might move out of Europe to the Far East.
</P>
<P>
Most Formula One teams are based in Britain, and Finance
Minister Gordon Brown said today their activities provided 50,000
jobs.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco advertisers, who are barred from using television
directly in most of Europe, see Formula One as a vital way of
reaching a worldwide television audience.
</P>
<P>
Anti-smoking groups condemned the move and the European
Commission said it was disappointed, but cigarette manufacturers,
who pump an estimated 100 million pounds (170 million U.S.
dollars) into Formula One each year, praised the announcement.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Asks U.N. to Tighten Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Monday that it would seek a strong resolution against Iraq to
press Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to reverse his decision on
U.N. weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
"We will be seeking a strong resolution... a resolution that
will condemn his actions, demand that he reverse course and take
up where the security council left off," State Department
spokesman James Rubin said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
The strong resolution against Iraq includes restrictions of
Iraqi officials to travel beyond their country, which were
considered several weeks ago, but were rejected in the Security
Council, Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had been
contacting her Russian and French counterparts Yevgeny Primakov
and Herbert Vedrine, whose countries opposed the travel
restrictions resolution in the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
He would not disclose the results of her contacts but said
the secretary of state felt "quite good."
</P>
<P>
"We are going to see a greater support in the Council for the
kind of ratcheted-up pressure that such a resolution would
entail," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the United States had not ruled out any options --
including military action -- but "the first order of business is
this kind of resolution" to tighten travel restrictions on Iraqi
officials.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the White House said President Bill Clinton wanted
the U.N. Security Council to issue an "unambiguous and strong
statement" on resuming weapons inspections, which have been
suspended for a week during talks between U.N. envoys and Iraqi
officials over Iraq's refusal to allow Americans in U.N. weapons
inspection teams to enter the country.
</P>
<P>
President made it clear that "the next step is to get a very
strong resolution from the United Nations manifesting the
determination of the international community to resume those
inspections."
</P>
<P>
He was said to be "satisfied" with a U-2 spy plane to resume
its flight, on orders from the United Nations, early this morning
over Iraq without any incident.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore expressed hope that diplomatic
pressure still might force Saddam Hussein to reverse his
exclusion of Americans from U.N. weapons inspection teams.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to hope that the discussions will result in
Saddam Hussein deciding that he has to change his behavior," he
said at a Pentagon news conference.
</P>
<P>
As regards to U-2 flights over Iraq, Gore said the spy plane
would continue to fly for U.N. inspections and Iraq had no right
to challenge their flights.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to an Iraqi letter to the United Nations,
which said it did not recognize the U-2 flights as part of the
U.N. program.
</P>
<P>
"It is not for Iraq to decide whether it recognizes what
forces make up the U.N. inspection effort," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to continue activities such as the U-2 flights,"
he said. "We're going to insist... that Iraq observe the United
Nations resolutions in every particular."
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen confirmed at the same news
conference that a U-2 spy plane mission over central Iraq was
completed without direct threats from Iraqi forces.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said it was important that the Security Council insists
there be "no exceptions, no negotiations" with Iraq on complying
with U.N. resolutions that authorize weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Bill Richardson said in
an interview with CNN that Washington wanted to see the Security
Council agree on a "resolution with teeth, with punitive
measure ... to stop Saddam playing games."
</P>
<P>
Richardson complained that the United Nations gave attention
to Iraqi Foreign Minister Tareq Aziz's arrival in New York and
his talks with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, saying "it's
just more delay and denial."
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why everyone is giving this visit so much
attention ... We dno't expect much to come of it," he said.

UNITED NATIONS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The offices of the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) were cooperating on the
transfer of agriculture equipment from the Republic of Korea (ROK)
to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), UNDP releases
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The equipment, intended to help bolster DPRK's agriculture
sector, includes earth-moving machinery and transport and support
vehicles, which will cross the sea route of the Demilitarized
Zone, from Inchon in ROK to Nampo in DPRK.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first real cooperation between North and South
Korea through UNDP on sustainable activities in the agriculture
sector. We hope that UNDP in Pyongyang and UNDP in Seoul will be
able to foster more of this type of collaboration in the future,"
said UNDP Resident Representative Christian Lemaire in Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
The shipment will be used to strengthen UNDP's Agricultural
Rehabilitation Program in DPRK. Drought and tidal waves have
wiped out much of the country's harvest this year, and are
responsible for destroying 70 percent of its maize crop.

<P>
LUSAKA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) will promote sustained improvements in the
survival, development and welfare of Zambian women and children
during the year 1997 to 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to an UNICEF program available here today, it will
address not only the immediate needs of the children, but also to
develop strategies to address the underlying causes of these
problems.
</P>
<P>
It will take actions to position the children and women at the
centre of Zambia's reform and development agenda, to increase
their access to quality services and to strengthen community and
family capacities to protect and care for the children.
</P>
<P>
It plans to halt the increasing infant and young child
mortality and stabilize the under five mortality rate below 200
per 1,000 live births.
</P>
<P>
Infant mortality rates in the country have risen to 113 from
80 per 1,000 live births since the 1980's and under five
mortality rates have increased from 150 to 202 per 1,000.
</P>
<P>
The figures are expected to swell by as much as 20 and 45
percent respectively by the year 2,000 due to rising HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
These rates, combined with increased adult deaths due to AIDS
related illnesses, have resulted in a drop in adult life
expectancy from 54 years in the mid 1980's to 45.5 in the 1990's.

BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Television and Radio
stations will begin satellite broadcasting on January 1 of 1998,
making their programs accessible to people in the mountainous
areas around the city.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Prefer Movies to TV, Survey Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Watching movies in a theatre
is still the most popular entertainment for most Chinese citizens,
a recent survey conducted in five cities has concluded.
</P>
<P>
The Horizon Market Survey and Analysis Company, a
non-governmental Beijing-based research company, randomly surveyed
1,524 Chinese citizens in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xiamen and
Chongqing, and found that 46.9 percent of those questioned regard
going to the movies as their favorite form of entertainment. The
figure is 12 percent higher than for those who prefer watching TV.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile less than 10 percent of those surveyed say they often
watch movies, which shows that the market status of Chinese-made
movies is not flourishing, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Most of those who do not like watching domestic movies choose
more convenient and simpler forms of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese have long criticized the relatively high ticket
price and low quality of Chinese-made movies.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Balance of Payment Worsens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The overall balance of
payment up to September this year fell to a surplus of 94 million
U.S. Dollars from 322 million Dollars in the previous year,
according to the latest issue of Economic Review.
</P>
<P>
During the same period under review, the current account
deficit increased from 113 million Dollars to 323 million
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Economic Review, a monthly publication issued by the Central
Bank of Kenya attributed the worsening balance of payment mainly
to a poor trade balance and decline in short-term capital flows.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that in term of values, the increase in imports
surpasses exports due to the weakening of the Kenyan currency of
Shillings against other convertible hard currencies.
</P>
<P>
The trade balance worsened to a deficit of 1,057 million
Dollars by September this year from a deficit of 965 million
Dollars in the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The decision of the International Monetary Fund to suspend a
loan package to Kenya has resulted in a 22 percent decline in
short term capital flows from 464 million Dollars to 362 million
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the services account surplus declined
to 734 million Dollars from previous year's 852 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that a worsening balance of payment
position may cause further weakening of the Shilling against
international hard currencies.

<HEADLINE> PLO Official Calls for Boycotting Doha Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestine Liberation
Organization's (PLO) official Monday night called on Arabs to
boycott the Doha conference which will include Israel.
</P>
<P>
According to the local newspaper Daily Star today, Farouk
Kaddoumi, head of the PLO political department, also warned
against individual nation's possible separate peace deals with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after meeting with Lebanese Foreign
Minister Farez Boueiz at the Foreign Ministry, Kaddoumi said "we
are against Arab countries attending the conference because we
don't expect with meeting to come out with any economic benefits."
</P>
<P>
"The conference was publicized in the Middle East during a
tour by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and aims at
normalizing Arab-Israeli ties and making Arabs who attend look
submissive in the world's eyes," he added.
</P>
<P>
The controversial fourth Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
economic conference is scheduled to be held in Doha on November
16-18 and is expected by the U.S. to lead to greater Arab-Israeli
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria and some other Arab countries have threatened
to boycott the conference in protest against Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line policies.
</P>
<P>
The two countries boycotted the first three conferences in
Casablanca, Amman and Cairo in 1994, 1995 and 1996, arguing that
progress on the political scene should precede economic
normalization between the Arabs and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said "Netanyahu's maneuvers and his refusal to abide by
the peace agreements signed by Labor governments with the Arabs
make the Doha conference and the resumption of peace talks a waste
of time and an attempt to polish Netanyahu's image."
</P>
<P>
Kaddoumi said last week's Palestinian-Israeli negotiations,
held in Washington under the U.S. umbrella, had failed to reach
tangible results.
</P>
<P>
The Tunis-based Palestinian official is an open critic of the
1993 Oslo accords and has so far abstained from returning
permanently to the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Kaddoumi called for more active European and Russian role in
brokering peace in the Middle East, saying that he has voiced this
view in his recent meetings with European Union Middle East envoy
Miguel-Angel Moratinos and Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov.

<P>
LAGOS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- At least 20 people were feared
dead and goods estimated at millions of Naira destroyed in a dawn
fire which gutted the Abubakar Gumi Central Market in Kaduna,
north Nigeria, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The fire which started at 2:00 am from a restaurant adjacent
to the main entrance of the market razed the complex, leaving
nothing for the firemen to salvage, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Fire fighters were said to have found it difficult to move
fire fighting machines into the market, owing to the blockade of
the entrance to the market.
</P>
<P>
A bulldozer which attempted to clear the way for the fire
fighters crushed one person while its driver was lynched by an
irate mob.
</P>
<P>
The market police station was completely burnt, while
unconfirmed report said seven suspects were being detained.
</P>
<P>
Several people who attempted to retrieve their goods were hurt
and a victim, who could not control himself, threw himself into
the fire in his shop and was burnt to death.
</P>
<P>
Describing Monday as "the saddest day of my life", State
Administrator Hamed Ali warned against looting, saying a
high powered panel will be set up to probe the incident.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, security operatives arrested more than
20 people for looting while one of the looters was killed by
people at the market.
</P>
<P>
Lorries that brought goods from the southern part of the
country were unable to discharge their loads due to the raging
fire.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Itzhak Mordechai is to visit Turkey from November 8 to 10 to
further strengthen their military ties.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day visit, Mordechai will exchange views
with Turkish government and army leaders over a number of key
defense issues, local newspaper Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli defense minister is also expected to discuss
with Turkish officials the details and exact date of the
controversial Israeli-Turkish-U.S. naval exercises.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted senior Turkish defense sources, who declined
to be named, as saying that Mordechai will also urge Ankara
to replace its tank units with Israeli-made Merkava-3 tanks.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai will be the second high-ranking defense official to
visit Turkey in the last two months after Israeli Defense
Forces Chief of Staff Amnon Shahak.
</P>
<P>
The increasing Turkish-Israeli military cooperation has greatly
disturbed the Arab countries as they believe that the close
cooperation is posing a threat to the security of the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkey has repeatedly stated that the Turkish-Israeli
cooperation is not directed against any other countries.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar edged
higher in trade today but a lack of incentives left it to close
just shy of 70.00 US cents.
</P>
<P>
The local unit settled at 69.94 US cents, from 69.58
previously.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the currency had received an early boost in a
quiet market from some local buying this morning.
</P>
<P>
"It was a bit of a short market and we saw a short squeeze,"
Commonwealth Bank corporate foreign exchange senior manager
Stavros Nitis said.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the focus remained on global sharemarkets and, in
particular, those in the Southeast Asian region.
</P>
<P>
As a result, a strengthening Australian Stock Exchange and Hong
Kong bourse also helped the local unit higher today.
</P>
<P>
The market had been wary this morning, expecting Friday's
decline on Wall Street would translate into a weaker equity market
here.
</P>
<P>
On the Australian Stock Exchange today the all ordinaries index
closed up 2.4 points at 2524.0, after losing some ground earlier
in the session.
</P>
<P>
In late trading in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index was up 101.81
points at 10094.65, after trading to an earlier high of 10251.65.
</P>
<P>
However, local traders said the sustained rises on the
sharemarkets still had to be seen and downside pressure remained
on the Australian dollar due to the Southeast Asian turmoil.
</P>
<P>
On the cross rates, the Australian dollar finished at 87.31 yen
from 86.21 previously, and at 1.1886 marks from 1.2001.

<HEADLINE> Interest Rates Fall as Liquidity Improves in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Interbank interest rates have
retreated to the mid twenties currently from above 30 percent
last week in Kenya as the money market responded to moderate
liquidity, local reports said today.
</P>
<P>
This improvement was a result of developments in the Treasury
bills market where the T-bill auction resulted in a net-in of
five billion Shillings (80.6 million U.S. Dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
It also came in the wake of the base rate increases effected
by major banks in the past couple of weeks and triggered by
T-bill discount rates, especially the 90-day rate which saw a
drop of 30 basis points last week.
</P>
<P>
The market players are now expectedly to take cue from last
week's reduction and either pitch T-bill tenders lower, or try
and fix higher bank deposits or commercial Paper rates.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the authorities will prefer stability
combined with slow reductions in interest rates and for that
reason the T-bill rates may not fall dramatically in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
T-Bonds traded in the market last week amounted to 1.5 billion
Shillings (24.2 million Dollars). Equities continued to trade
within a narrow range of 3,272-3,308 points, with last week
seeing a fall in prices particularly among blue chips.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Non-State-Run Economy Grows Stronger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's non-state-run
businesses have increased to more than 65,000, 27 times the number
just five years ago.
</P>
<P>
The city's non-state-run business sector now ranks first in
China in terms of the number, registered capital, employees and
the number of company-scale businesses, which account for 80
percent of the city's individually owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics also show that 73 percent of Shanghai's
non-state-run firms are in the service industry, with 2,000
technology-related businesses, twice the country's average.
</P>
<P>
At present, its average registered capital posts 600,000 yuan,
20 percent higher than the country's average.
</P>
<P>
In recent years the sector has emerged as an important source
of re-employing laid-off workers and idle labor forces. Shanghai's
non-state-run businesses hired 80,000 people in the first half of
this year. Up to then, the sector has hired about 100,000 of the
city's laid-off workers and 300,000 spare laborers from the
countryside in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
In addition, this sector plays an indispensable role in
commodity circulation. Currently, its businesses have secured 7
percent of the city's retail market, with the annual sales topping
8 billion yuan (963 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Shanghai now gets 30 percent of its revenue from the
non-state-run sector. Last year, it collected 1.2 billion yuan
(144 million U.S. dollars) from the sector, a 47-fold increase
over 1992.
</P>
<P>
The remarkable growth of the city's non-state-run sector could
partly be attributed to their diversified fund-raising channels.
Some 1,700 businesses have been co-invested with state-owned and
collectively owned enterprises, and more than 100 private
companies have been founded with investment from overseas.
</P>
<P>
In the next phase, the sector is aiming at large-scale
operations. So far, Shanghai has four conglomerates tied to
individual enterprenuers. The non-state-run businesses with
registered capital of more than 10 million yuan account for 26 and
those with more than 5 million yuan account for 400.
</P>
<P>
Economists forecast that the city's non-state-run businesses
will amount to 80,000, with their total industrial value exceeding
34.3 billion yuan and retail sales hitting 36.3 billion yuan by
the end of this century.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Sabine Applemans of Belgium
on Monday ousted Ruxandra Dragomir of Romania 6-4, 6-1 at the
Advanta Championships in Philaelphia, United States.
</P>
<P>
The victory boosted Applemans' chance of capturing one of the
three remaining berths for next week's season-ending Chase
Championships in New York. Applemans is currently ranked 17th in
the standings for the 16-player field.
</P>
<P>
American Lisa Raymond has booked her place in New York by
bouncing Czech veteran Helena Sukova 6-3, 6-4, which put her just
a handful of points ahead of Applemans.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Ai Sugiyama, a distant longshot for a Chase place,
stayed alive by trouncing former prodigy Jennifer Capriati 6-2,
6-1.
</P>
<P>
The draw features nine of the top 10-ranked players tuning up
for the season finale, with world number one Martina Hingis,
second seed Jana Novotna, third seed Amanda Coetzer and fourth
seed Monica Seles receiving first-round byes.
</P>

<P>
HANGZHOU, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A number of Chinese
alligators have arrived at a breeding center in Changxing County,
Zhejiang Province, to take part in the region's drive to propagate
the endangered species.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s there were only four alligators in the county.
Through experts' efforts to adopt scientific breeding and raising
methods for the endangered species, the number of alligators has
increased to the current 150.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s Zhejiang Province has enhanced the protection
and breeding of rare animals. There are now 250 breeding centers
for such wildlife as the macaque, muntjac, sika and black bear.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the province set the week from April 4 to 10 as
"Bird-Protection Week" so as to develop people's understanding of
the need to safeguard migrant birds and wild animals.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 egrets were given protection in Liangzhu Town
of Yuhang city last year.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang Province also has seven natural preserves with more
than 70 kinds of wild animals under state protection.

WELLINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister-

is preparing to end the ban on nuclear-powered warship using NZ
ports.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald quoted Shipley today as saying that
she would be prepared to raise with New Zealanders the prospect of
ditching the decade-old nuclear ban, but only in extreme,
"strategic" circumstances.
</P>
<P>
In a personal statement in parliament this afternoon, Shipley
said the report was untrue, Radio NZ reported.
</P>
<P>
"I want to categorically put this matter to rest that at no
stage that I raised any such suggestion that New Zealand would
ever contemplate under a National-New Zealand First Government
lifting such a ban," she stated.
</P>
<P>
Shipley was supported by NZ First leader Winston Peters, who

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Reports Record Grain Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The three provinces in
northeast China, the country's leading grain producers, have
recorded good grain harvests despite an extended severe drought.
</P>
<P>
The three provinces, including Heilongjiang, Jilin and
Liaoning, expect this year's total grain harvest to hit 63.5
billion kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang, China's northernmost province, witnessed a
record-high yield of 31 billion kg., with Jilin setting an
all-time high of 20 billion kg,, and Liaoning harvesting 12.5
billion kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Some 40 percent of the farmland in northeast China was hit by a
severe drought earlier this year. However, local agricultural
officials attribute the good grain harvests to implementation of
the rural household contract responsibility system, the mass
construction of irrigation facilities and increased funding for
agriculture.

SHENYANG, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province, an important industrial base which is home to one-tenth
of China's large and medium state-owned enterprises, has announced
it will invite more foreign experts to help with the province's
major industrial projects.
</P>

years. Foreign experts are to be invited to launch production
automation, and industrialization of high-tech industries as well
as to upgrade key equipment.
</P>

So far, some 60 percent of Liaoning's state-owned enterprises
are in red and the province has decided to take three years to
complete their technical improvements, which need technical
support of foreign experts.
</P>
<P>
The official added that experts are also to be asked to assist
with the industrialization of the grain and vegetable production,
aquatic products, fruit tree planting and export-oriented
agriculture.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Conference on Refugees, Migratory Movements Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- A two-day South Asian conference
on refugees and migratory movements began here Monday, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of India, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and
Bangladesh attended the conference. In the past five decades, the
South Asian region witnessed mass involuntary movements of 35
million to 40 million people.
</P>
<P>
The conference is being held under the auspices of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees with wide participation of
"eminent persons" groups who work closely with the UN body in
their respective countries, the Daily Star said.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Star added that the region experienced many migratory
movements including the Indo-Pakistan refugee flow in 1947, which
was the largest international flow in the world history.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad told the
conference that "Bangladesh has been both a country of origin and
also a generous enough country for asylum."
</P>
<P>
"We, therefore, have a clear perspective of the issue and all
that it involves," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are not a party to the 1951 Refugee Convention or its 1967
Protocol. No country from South Asia has yet become a party," the
minister noted, adding "however, we do attach importance to both
these documents and strive to ensure that our activities and
attitude conform to their provisions."

<HEADLINE> Foreign Banks to Give Loan to Dhaka's Private Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Bank (BB) has
finalized modalities for a two-billion-taka (about 44.64 U.S.
dollars) industrial development fund to be used by the foreign
banks to boost term loans for the private sector in the country,
according to a BB circular today.
</P>
<P>
"All foreign commercial banks will provide medium and long term
loans to medium and large scale industries in addition to their
present level of industrial financing," the circular stated.
</P>
<P>
"To supplement this additional industrial credit, it has been
decided that the Bangladesh Bank (central bank) will provide
re-finance to the financing banks."
</P>
<P>
The foreign banks in Bangladesh will disburse loans from their
own resources and claim half of the amount disbursed as re-finance
from the central bank, the circular said, adding that the banks
will get the money from the BB at the bank rate.
</P>
<P>
This move to create the special fund was taken last month by
Finance Minister SAMS Kibria amidst allegations by the businessmen
that they could not get long-term loans from banks.
</P>
<P>
As 50 percent of the total loans will be provided from the
special fund, the total amount to be invested under the special
scheme will be 40 billion taka (about 89.28 million dollars), the
circular noted.
</P>
<P>
The BB has stressed that loans from the special fund should be
given on a priority basis to manufacturing industries in the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
Joint venture enterprises including local subsidiaries of
international companies will also be eligible for this fund.
</P>
<P>
The re-financing to the foreign banks will be for a period of
two to seven years, depending on the tenure of the loan sanctioned
to each individual project, the circular added.
</P>
<P>
The foreign banks will have to repay the money to the central
bank in installments which will be fixed for each individual
withdrawal of funds, according to the modalities.
</P>
<P>
A grace period will be given to the banks for repayment of the
money, but banks will have to pay interests on the loans for the
grace period.
</P>
<P>
After the expiry of the grace period, the central bank will
recover the money on quarterly basis, starting from the date on
which the grace period expires, the circular said.

<HEADLINE> India to Discuss Competitive Devaluation Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 11 (XINHUA) -- Competitive devaluation as a
policy option in the wake of the Southeast Asian currency crisis,
and other factors hitting exports are expected to be discussed at
a review meeting Wednesday, an official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be chaired by Prime Minister Inder Kumar
Gujral and attended by some ministers concerned.
</P>
<P>
The government fears an export crisis in the coming months,
with at least three factors acting in conjunction- a sharp fall in
the premium on special import licenses (SIL), the sharp
devaluation of the currencies of competing exporters and the
threat to the country's export schemes by the European Union's
charge that they offer excessive and unfair subsidies.
</P>
<P>
Even going by optimistic projections, the export targets for
1997-98 financial year for major sectors like agricultural
products, gems and jewelry, and textiles and garments are likely
to be missed, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The three sectors cumulatively account for more than half of
Indian exports, with agriculture contributing 19 percent, gems and
jewelry 17 percent and textiles and garments 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The huge devaluation by several competing countries and their
ability to undercut prices by almost 10-15 percent is expected to
hurt the overall growth rate. The Pakistani rupee's fall to 42
rupees per U.S. dollar from 34 rupees a dollar a few months ago is
hurting India's rice exports. India has predicted that textiles,
chemicals, agricultural products, particularly marine products and
rice would be hit further in future.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Announces New Package of Economic Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian government today
announced a series of new economic measures, aiming to cut public
spending, raise taxes, stabilize financial market and attract more
foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
A package of 51 measures is expected to increase 20 billion
U.S. dollars in revenue for the country, and maintain the
stability of the Brazilian currency to avoid high inflation.
</P>
<P>
The package will reduce 15 percent of administrative spendings
and 6 percent of government's investment. But the measures will
not affect reforms of education, health, social welfare and
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
With the package, the government will lay off 33,000 workers to
save 5.2 billion dollars, and raise taxes of industrial products,
specially cars and beverages.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Brazilian President Fernando Cardoso said today that
it was important for his country to take such measures, for the
adjustments could defend a strong currency and prevent high
inflation rate from affecting the country again.
</P>
<P>
He admitted the measures will be a bitter pill for taxpayers,
but will not affect their daily life and incomes.
</P>
<P>
The package is another temporary move by the Brazilian
government after the Brazilian financial market was affected by
the turmoil in Asian markets. The Central Bank of Brazil increased
the monthly interest from 1.58 percent to 3.05 percent and sold
billions of dollars of its reserves to maintain the current
exchange rate between real and U.S. dollar.

Apple Computer Inc. pioneered the commercial personal computer
in the late 1970s and made computing easy with the Macintosh in
the mid-1980s. But the company was hammered by the growing
popularity of Windows-based computers, and suffered alarming
losses to its bottom line and market share.
</P>
<P>
The company has gone through several reorganizations and bouts
of cost-cutting. Since July, Apple has drastically restricted the
ability of other computer makers to clone Macs, and forged an
alliance with longtime rival, Microsoft.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States-based
world leading automotive company, General Motors (GM), has planned
to enter the small car market in India, The Observer of Business
and Politics reported today.
</P>
<P>
Disclosing this at a function organized by the Confederation of
Indian Industries (CII) here on Monday, GM chairman John F. Smith
Jr. said that "We plan to introduce Opel Corsa in the Indian
market within the next three-four years."
</P>
<P>
GM international operations president Louis R. Huges said that
the company would induce its component manufacturers to set up
shop in the country.
</P>
<P>
"You can't have a major presence in India with one vehicle and,
therefore, you will see additions in our presence here by way of a
smaller vehicle and a larger vehicle," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Smith, in 1997, GM's combined operations in India
will have invested about 300 million U.S. dollars in the country.
These investments include everything from autos to auto parts,
software and satellites, financial services and locomotives and
advanced radar systems.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A Pakistani man was
convicted today of killing two Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
employees in a 1993 shooting spree outside the agency's
headquarters and could receive the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
A 12-member Fairfax County jury deliberated for four hours
before finding Mir Aimal Kasi guilty of one count of capital
murder, another count of first-degree murder and three counts of
malicious wounding.
</P>
<P>
The penalty phase was to begin on Tuesday morning, Fairfax
Circuit Court Judge J. Howe Brown announced. The 33-year Kasi,
captured in June in Pakistan by the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI), could face death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Kasi was found guilty of shooting to death Frank Darling, a
28-year-old covert operative for the CIA, and Lansing Bennett, a
66-year-old physician and intelligence analyst. He was also
convicted of wounding two other CIA workers and an employee of a
CIA contractor.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani walked amid stopped cars in morning rush-hour
traffic outside the CIA compound on January 25, 1993, firing at
people inside them with an AK-47 assault rifle, the prosecutors
said.
</P>
<P>
During the trial, prosecutors said Kasi was out to avenge
American bombing of Iraq during the Persian Gulf War and American
meddling in Muslim nations of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Kasi showed no motion as the verdict was read today.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic is ready
to pay for its North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
membership and participate in peace-keeping in Bosnia after June
1998, Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference after meeting with U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright, Klaus acknowledged there was "no room
for free riding" in joining NATO.
</P>
<P>
The Czech government's military spending in 1998 would total
230 million U.S. dollars -- 200 million for its armed forces and
30 million for NATO operating costs, Klaus said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We know it's impossible to be consumers of collective
security. We have to be producers as well."
</P>
<P>
In July, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland were invited to
join NATO, with the Czech Republic however reportedly lagging
behind the other two in preparations for the move.
</P>
<P>
During his week-long trip here, Klaus also met other senior
U.S. officials, Congress members and businessmen.

<HEADLINE> Asian Financial Crisis Would Mean Slowdown in World Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The financial crisis
originating from Southeast Asia would mean a slowdown in world
economic growth perhaps by as much as one percentage point, a
high-ranking U.N. official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the U.N. Economic and Financial Committee, Secretary
General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD) Rubens Ricupero said that for the first time a crisis
originating in the developing world has had a profound impact on
capital markets of the North.
</P>
<P>
"No one is immune from the effects of actions taken or not
taken in another country or on the other side of the globe," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the Asian financial crisis is firmly located
in the private sector and revolved around market rather than
government failure.
</P>
<P>
However, Ricupero said, the immediate danger is the
overreaction by policy-makers, as unduly heavy-handed
macroeconomic response could set back reform efforts in developing
countries for the foreseeable future.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's 9-month Wine Imports Drop 20 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's imports of wine
totaled 540,000 cases during the first nine months of this year,
down 22 percent compared with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics by the Thai Customs
Department, even imported samples of wine priced at 50 to 70 baht
(1.35 to 1.9 U.S. dollars) also declined significantly during the
period of this year.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's total wine imports for this year are expected at 700
to 800 million baht (19 to 21.6 million dollars), also will
decrease by 20 percent compared with last year, the department
said.
</P>
<P>
The decrease in wine imports was attributed to the country's
economic slowdown and the government's higher tax policies, which
pinched the purchasing power of consumers, the department said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government earlier this year raised the excise tax on
wine from 40 percent to 50 percent and the value added tax from 7
percent to 10 percent.

<P>
SINGAPORE, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Singapore is expecting
container throughput at its port to break the 14 million TEU
(twenty-foot equivalent unit) mark this year, as container
throughput increased by 8.95 percent in the first nine months of
the year.
</P>
<P>
According to local industrial sources today, the latest
statistics published by the Maritime and Port Authority of
Singapore (MPA), container throughput for the first nine months of
this year totaled 10.45 million TEUs, up from 9.59 million TEUs
compared with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Assuming the same rate of increase is sustained for the
remainder of the year, the Port of Singapore will surpass the 14
million TEU mark by the end of the year, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Last year the Port of Singapore registered a record container
throughput of 12.9 million TEUs, making it the world's second
largest container port behind Hong Kong with 13.5 million TEUs.
</P>
<P>
Continued growth in container throughput at the port, which
comes largely from transshipment to and from the region, indicates
that trade has not been hit by the recent economic turmoil in
Asia, the sources said.

BANGKOK, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Public Health
Ministry has given tobacco manufacturers and importers one year
grace period for them to change health warning labels on cigarette

<HEADLINE> Peacekeepers Should Avoid Domestic Affairs: Qin Huasun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- China said today that
although peacekeeping operations have increasingly dealt with
countries' internal conflicts in recent years, that should not be
used as an excuse to interfere in the internal affairs of these
countries.
</P>
<P>
This was expounded by Qin Huasun, permanent representative of
China to the United Nations. He was speaking at the Fourth
Committee (Special Political and Neocolonization) of the
U.N. General Assembly on the agenda of peacekeeping operations,
today.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council should strengthen its guidance and
supervision over multinational forces to prevent and stop any act
that goes beyond the mandate given by the Council, and jeopardizes
the reputation and image of the United Nations, Qin said.
</P>
<P>
He said a necessary and stable financial basis is essential to
the success of any peacekeeping operation. The the withholding of
peacekeeping assessments by Member States, in particular some
major contributors, has seriously dampened the enthusiasm of
troop-contributing countries.
</P>
<P>
He called on the concerned countries to rapidly clear their
arrears, in full and without conditions.
</P>
<P>
Qin said enhancing the rapid-deployment capacity of
peacekeeping operations is important in effectively implementing
the relevant resolutions of the Council and preventing situations
from getting out of control.
</P>
<P>
China supports U.N. efforts to enhance stand-by
arrangements and announced last May its readiness to participate
in them, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
As the President of the Security Council this month, Qin said,
China will continue to urge the Council to devote more time to
discussing and resolving African issues. China hoped the U.N. will
provide more assistance to African countries and organizations to
enhance Africa's capacity to prevent and resolve conflicts
on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Peace and development are the two major issues in today's
world, Qin said. Many conflicts in the world were, in
the final analysis, caused by the question of development.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. should make great efforts to promote development and
help lift developing countries, particularly the least developed
nations, out of poverty as the only way to truly prevent conflicts
and secure an environment of long-term stability and peace, Qin
said.

<HEADLINE> Chile's Fish Exports Grow by 7.1 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Chile's fish exports amounted
to 1.43 billion U.S. dollars during the first nine months this
year, up 7.1 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The National Society of Fishing said the figure slightly
outgrows projections made for the year.
</P>
<P>
It said the outcome is due to the high captures achieved in the
northern coast, the stable high price of fish meal and the strong
start of salmon fishing over the last quarter.
</P>
<P>
The society termed as "relative" the impact of the "El Nino"
phenomenon in the fishing industry. In the northern zone, the
capture of anchovy increased by 48 percent, while in the
mid-southern zone, captures of saurel dropped by 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Nonetheless, the latter figure is compensated by captures of
other species like sardines and anchovy, a better production of
canned saurel and the best price of fish meal," it said.

SOFIA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria should develop economic
and trade cooperation with the Asian-Pacific region, President
Petar Stoyanov told a a workshop today.
</P>
<P>
The workshop was entitled "Bulgaria and the Asian and Pacific
Region: Opportunities for Partnership in the 21st Century."

opportunities for the Bulgarian economy. It was time for Bulgaria
to further discuss development of cooperation and partnership with
the countries in the region.
</P>

Bulgaria's economy had been left almost unscathed by the
turmoil in financial markets in Southeast Asia because of the
country's insufficient integration in the global economy, Stoyanov
said.

Stoyanov also expected an increased Asian investment flow into
Eastern European countries.

media release received today.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Thailand Cuts Fertilizer Purchase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Ministry of
Agriculture and Cooperatives has decided to cut by nearly half the
amount of chemical fertilizers it planned to buy for the next crop
year, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after Chucheep Harnsawat, who earlier
this year ordered the purchase of one million tons of fertilizers
for the coming crop year, was stepping down last weekend as head
of the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that it will buy only 439,000 tons of three
formulae of fertilizers that farmers urgently need, according to
the reports.
</P>
<P>
The three formulae are the fertilizers with nitrogen,
phosphorous and potassium contents at the ratios of 16-20-0,
16-16-8, and 15-15-15, which are mainly used by rice farmers, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
However, the terms and conditions for the bidding will remain
unchanged, the ministry noted.
</P>
<P>
The cutback was prompted by baht fluctuations and budget
shortfalls, it added.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also said that it will call another round of
bidding if the country's financial situation improves and the new
government wants to procure one million tons of fertilizers.

<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- After 10 years of effort, the
Shaanxi Provincial Rescue Center for Wild Animals has become a
paradise of those wild animals facing extinction, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Since its establishment in 1987, the center has rescued the
lives of 13 giant pandas, 41 golden monkeys, 24 takins, five
white-lip deers, one leopard and 37 other wild animals, according
to Zhao Xia, director of the center.
</P>
<P>
Some of the animals rescued by the center have been released
back into the wild, and others who lost their capacities to live
in wild environment are still being raised by the center,
including three pandas, 30 golden monkeys, 16 takins, three
white-lip deers, one leopard and several bears, pheasants and
owls, Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
Located in Louguantai State Forest Park in Qinling Mountain,
the center has good conditions and large facilities to house and
raise wild animals after 10 years of construction.
</P>
<P>
And during that period, experts in the center also did a number
of research projects in reproduction concerning wild animals who
are near extinction and accumulated a lot of experience in
rescuing, raising and tending wild animals.
</P>
<P>
At present, the center has artificially reproduced 15 golden
monkeys, one panda and one takin, Zhao said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Wants APEC to Name New Members At Vancouver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister
Ali Alatas said Indonesia anticipates that the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders' meeting to be held in
Vancouver, Canada, late this month will name new members of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from setting up criteria for electing new members, I
believe that the summit will be more productive if, based on this,
new members are named," Alatas said here last night.
</P>
<P>
The issue of selecting new APEC members has become increasing
difficult as several members believe that APEC will become
inefficient if it has too many members, officials at the Foreign
Ministry today quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
After last year's meeting in Manila, ministers agreed to
establish conventions for selecting new members, and said their
decision would be announced at next year's meeting in Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
But, Alatas said some APEC members, including Indonesia, want
this decision to be acted upon at the Vancouver meeting and
officiated in the following Kuala Lumpur meeting, adding that as
yet, there has been no agreement on the proposal.
</P>
<P>
At least 11 countries want to join APEC, including Vietnam,
Russia, Peru, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
APEC consists of 18 members -- Australia, Brunei, Canada,
China, Chile, Hong Kong (China), Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia,
Mexico, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, New Zealand, Singapore,
South Korea, Chinese Taipei, Thailand and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Two Key U.S. Senators Back NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Two key senators of the
United States said today after a series of hearings that expanding
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was the correct
policy for Washington to pursue.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Senate colleagues, Jesse Helms, chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Joseph Biden, the ranking
Democrat, expressed their views on bringing new members into the
16-nation NATO.
</P>
<P>
"We are persuaded the overwhelming weight of testimony
reinforces the argument for NATO enlargement," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
The two senators said they expected the costs of NATO
enlargement to be "relatively small for the U.S. and affordable
for new and current European allies."
</P>
<P>
They cited testimony by Clinton administration officials that
the cost is likely to be less than the Pentagon projected in
February because the military infrastructure in these countries is
in better condition than previously estimated.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon estimated that total expansion cost from 1997 to
2007 would be between 27 billion and 35 billion dollars, with
U.S. costs in the range of 1.5 billion to two billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The hearings "helped to ease concerns on various points related
to relations with Russia," which vigorously opposed enlargement of
the alliance to its eastern border by including three former
Warsaw pact members, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The new NATO-Russia Joint Council, established to make
enlargement more palatable to Moscow, "will have no undue
influence or veto" over NATO decisions.
</P>
<P>
NATO leaders agreed to accept Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic by 1999 as full members. The agreement needs to be
ratified by the Senate with a two-thirds majority vote.

momentum of the country's electronics industry, the country's
biggest foreign reserves earner, the local press reports said
today.
</P>
<P>
The package forms part of an eight-point strategy entitled
Philippines Electronics Sector Masterplan, which was recently
approved by the Cabinet, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Foremost in the plan is the creation of a world class science
park which will house world class communications, transport,
power, water and social facilities for the electronics sector.
</P>
<P>
The plan also calls for revisions to the education system for
technology and management students, and implementation of an
upgrade program to encourage multinational firms to assist local
companies to move up the technology ladder.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the plan also urges modification in the ways
investors work with government agencies by streamlining and
simplifying procedures.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Secretary Cesar Bautisa expected the plan to
significantly improve the overall attractiveness of the
Philippines as a regional manufacturing base.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines' exports of electronics products have grown at
an average of over 35 percent annually since 1990, and reached
10.2 billion U.S. dollars in 1996 or nearly two-thirds of the
country's total export earnings that year.

British monarchy. He said the flag issue was being kept in the
background because it would "imperil the campaign for a republic".
</P>

<HEADLINE> Greece: Efforts for Solving Cyprus Issue to Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Greece believed that current
moves towards resolving the protracted Cyprus problem would
continue in "an effective, just, feasible and final way," Greek
government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said here today.
</P>
<P>
The recent statements by Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem
showed Ankara was moving in the wrong direction because the
northern Cyprus was recognized only by Turkey, he said while
commenting on a visit by U.S. presidential envoy Richard Holbrooke
to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke is expected to visit Cyprus today for talks with both
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash in a bid to find a solution to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Cem said in the northern Cyprus that
Cyprus could not join the European Union unless the northern
Cyprus was recognized.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has also warned that if the Greek Cypriots enter the EU,
the northern Cyprus would be integrated with Turkey at once.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been unofficially partitioneded since 1974 when
Turkish troops took control of its northern third following an
abortive coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Reppas stressed that President Clerides had stated that he was
willing to discuss the manner in which Turkish Cypriots would take
part in Cyprus' delegation that will negotiate the island
republic's entry into the EU.
</P>
<P>
He also said that U.S. State Department Coordinator for Cyprus,
Thomas Miller, might visit Greece within the next few days.
</P>
<P>
In October, Miller visited Athens for talks with Greek leaders
to discuss the Cyprus problem.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- China today asked the
World Trade Organization (WTO) to demonstrate its universality
when admitting applicants particularly developing applicants.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Second Committee (Economic and Financial) of
the 52nd Assembly of the United Nations on the agenda of trade and
development, a Chinese delegate said WTO should remove
inappropriate obstacles posed by some member states and create
opportunities to admit new applicants under conditions that are
congruent with the level and requirement of their economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Shaofu, Minister Counselor of the Permanent Mission of
China to the U.N. pointed out that it is against the trend of
globalization and is harmful to the broader international economic
cooperation to keep some important trade partners out of WTO.
</P>
<P>
He said globalization and liberalization should be preceded by
establishing a fair and non-discriminatory multilateral trade
system and creating a favorable external economic environment
which responds adequately to the needs of the developing countries
and recognizes the diversity and vulnerability of the developing
economies.
</P>
<P>
The international community, Yuan said, especially the
developed countries, should view North-South and South-North
cooperation with a forward-looking vision and support the economic
and trade development of the developing countries with pragmatic
actions.
</P>
<P>
Yuan said that the overall prosperity of the developing
countries and the eradication of poverty in least developed
countries will be the focus of development for the next century.
</P>
<P>
"Only by realizing this objective, can the world be blessed
with truly global and meaningful sustainable development," he
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Convenes Conference on Hate Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- With hate crimes increasing
in the country, U.S. President Bill Clinton Monday called for
tougher laws to include all hate crimes that cause physical harm.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the White House Conference on hate crimes, Clinton
said, "One of the things that I hope will come out of this year is
a national affirmation that violence motivated by prejudice and
hatred hurts us all."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said Americans can no longer ignore "what happens when
racial or ethnic or religious animosity joins with lawlessness."
</P>
<P>
He announced measures including allowing victims of
housing-related hate crimes to seek monetary damages from their
attackers and devoting up to 50 extra FBI agents and federal
prosecutors toward enforcing hate crime laws.
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who thinks that in the world of today and tomorrow
that he or she can hide from the kind of poison that we see in
various places in our country is living in a dream world," Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
The conference was attended by about 350 people, including law
enforcement officials, civil rights activists, educators,
religious leaders and victims of hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
According to Justice Department statistics, 8,759 hate crimes
were reported in 1996, up from 7,947 reported in the previous
year. White House officials said they are not sure whether the
increase indicates that hate crimes are up or better reporting.
</P>
<P>
Race was a factor in 63 percent of all reported hate crimes,
followed by religion, 13.9 percent; sexual orientation, 12
percent; and ethnic origin, 11 percent.

spokesman James Rubin said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
The strong resolution against Iraq includes restrictions of
Iraqi officials to travel beyond their country, which were
considered several weeks ago, but were rejected in the Security
Council, Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had been
contacting her Russian and French counterparts Yevgeny Primakov
and Herbert Vedrine, whose countries opposed the travel
restrictions resolution in the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
He would not disclose the results of her contacts but said
the secretary of state felt "quite good."
</P>
<P>
"We are going to see a greater support in the Council for the
kind of ratcheted-up pressure that such a resolution would
entail," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the United States had not ruled out any options --
including military action -- but "the first order of business is
this kind of resolution" to tighten travel restrictions on Iraqi
officials.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the White House said President Bill Clinton wanted
the U.N. Security Council to issue an "unambiguous and strong
statement" on resuming weapons inspections, which have been
suspended for a week during talks between U.N. envoys and Iraqi
officials over Iraq's refusal to allow Americans in U.N. weapons
inspection teams to enter the country.
</P>
<P>
President made it clear that "the next step is to get a very
strong resolution from the United Nations manifesting the
determination of the international community to resume those
inspections."
</P>
<P>
He was said to be "satisfied" with a U-2 spy plane to resume
its flight, on orders from the United Nations, early this morning
over Iraq without any incident.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore expressed hope that diplomatic
pressure still might force Saddam Hussein to reverse his
exclusion of Americans from U.N. weapons inspection teams.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to hope that the discussions will result in
Saddam Hussein deciding that he has to change his behavior," he
said at a Pentagon news conference.
</P>
<P>
As regards to U-2 flights over Iraq, Gore said the spy plane
would continue to fly for U.N. inspections and Iraq had no right
to challenge their flights.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to an Iraqi letter to the United Nations,
which said it did not recognize the U-2 flights as part of the
U.N. program.
</P>
<P>
"It is not for Iraq to decide whether it recognizes what
forces make up the U.N. inspection effort," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to continue activities such as the U-2 flights,"
he said. "We're going to insist... that Iraq observe the United
Nations resolutions in every particular."
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen confirmed at the same news
conference that a U-2 spy plane mission over central Iraq was
completed without direct threats from Iraqi forces.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said it was important that the Security Council insists
there be "no exceptions, no negotiations" with Iraq on complying
with U.N. resolutions that authorize weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Bill Richardson said in
an interview with CNN that Washington wanted to see the Security
Council agree on a "resolution with teeth, with punitive
measure ... to stop Saddam playing games."
</P>
<P>
Richardson complained that the United Nations gave attention
to Iraqi Foreign Minister Tareq Aziz's arrival in New York and
his talks with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, saying "it's
just more delay and denial."
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why everyone is giving this visit so much
attention ... We dno't expect much to come of it," he said.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The offices of the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) were cooperating on the
transfer of agriculture equipment from the Republic of Korea (ROK)
to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), UNDP releases
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The equipment, intended to help bolster DPRK's agriculture
sector, includes earth-moving machinery and transport and support
vehicles, which will cross the sea route of the Demilitarized
Zone, from Inchon in ROK to Nampo in DPRK.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first real cooperation between North and South
Korea through UNDP on sustainable activities in the agriculture
sector. We hope that UNDP in Pyongyang and UNDP in Seoul will be
able to foster more of this type of collaboration in the future,"
said UNDP Resident Representative Christian Lemaire in Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
The shipment will be used to strengthen UNDP's Agricultural
Rehabilitation Program in DPRK. Drought and tidal waves have
wiped out much of the country's harvest this year, and are
responsible for destroying 70 percent of its maize crop.

<HEADLINE> Baltic States Refuse Russia's Security Guarantee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 10 (Xinhua) -- At the meeting in Palanga,
Lithuani, the presidents of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia Monday
rebuffed security guarantees offered by Russia to the Baltic
states, according to the Interfax news service.
</P>
<P>
A trilateral communique said the policy of the three states is
based on the idea of the indivisibility of the European security
system and is therefore directed primarily at integration into the
European Union and NATO.
</P>
<P>
Such integration, in opinion of the presidents of the Baltic
states, should sufficiently strengthen security in Europe."The
invariable goal of our states is a strive to integrate into NATO
and the European Union", the document said.
</P>
<P>
However, the leaders of the Baltic states appreciated the
Russia's willingness expressed by president Boris Yeltsin to
expand neighborly relations and mutually beneficial cooperation
with Baltic states.
</P>
<P>
They were satisfied with Moscow's readiness to continue a
political dialogue with Tallinn, Vilnius and Riga on a bilateral
basis and within the framework of various international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that Baltic leaders welcomed the signing of
the Russian-Lithuanian border treaty, and the leaders of Estonia
and Latvia voiced readiness to sign similar treaties with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin offered the Baltic states
security guarantees in a statement handed to Lithuanian President
Algirdas Brazauskas on October 24 when he was visiting Moscow.
Later similar offers were sent to the leaders of Estonia and
Latvia.

<HEADLINE> Blair Pledges to Make Britain Pivot of New World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair pledged here today to make Britain not only a leader in
Europe but also "the pivot of this new world".
</P>
<P>
Speaking in his first major foreign policy speech since winning
the May election, Blair set out his vision of a new Britain and
vowed to increase the country's influence in the world.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot in these post-Empire days be a super-power in the
military sense. But we can make the British presence in the world
felt," he told the annual banquet given by the Lord Mayor of
London.
</P>
<P>
"With our historic alliances, we can be pivotal. We can be
powerful in our influence -- a nation to whom others listen," he
said, adding "It is my belief that far from being standing alone,
Britain can be the pivot of this new world."
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the "guiding light" of the new Labor government,
Blair stressed the following four pinciples: The first was to
restore Britain's leading position in Europe, the second was to
forge strong links with the United States, the third was to
maintain a strong defense capacity and the fourth was to place
emphasis on ethics, human rights and free trade.
</P>
<P>
On the single European currency, Blair, whose government has
ruled out Britain's first-wave membership of the euro, said that
Britain had to prepare now for the single currency ahead of entry
in the next parliament.
</P>
<P>
"A successful single currency would be good for the Europe. But
it will affect us in or out," he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Drastically Cut Military Jobs for Weaponry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen announced today a drastic plan to cut 25 percent of
the military civilian jobs and make business reforms to save 3.2
billion U.S. dollars a year for new weaponry.
</P>
<P>
At a Pentagon press conference with Vice President Al Gore,
Cohen also called on Congress to approve two new rounds of
domestic base closings in 2001 and 2005 to save another 2.8
billion dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders explained that recent cuts in defense spending
and the government's moves to balance the federal budget simply
did not leave enough money for the nation's arms modernization.
</P>
<P>
Under the personnel cuts and business reforms, the Pentagon
will cut 28,000 out of 141,000 civilian jobs in targeted defense
organizations in the next four years.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said he would reduce one-third of his own 3,000-member
office staff worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Among the groups affected in the cuts would be the secretariats
for policy, acquisition, finance, personnel and intelligence, as
well as agencies responsible for commissaries, security, financial
accounting and information services.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 120,000 civilian defense jobs would also be put up
for bids between private agencies and the government under the
plan.
</P>
<P>
The initiatives are part of an ongoing reassessment of defense
manpower and resources that began last spring with the Quadrennial
Defense Review. The QDR recommended modest cuts in military forces
and preserved all major arms procurement programs.
</P>
<P>
In the business reform, the Pentagon will vastly increase its
use of computers and the Internet, using "electronic catalogues"
for purchasing and seeking achievement within three years of
entirely paper-free contracting for all major weapon systems.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon will also streamline travel planning and household
goods transportation for military and civilian employees to save
an estimated 300 million dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Gore and Cohen conceded that it would be difficult to get
Congressional approval of the base closures, but Defense officials
said that virtually all of the other moves would be accomplished
without Congressional approval.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Home Prices Rise 5 Percent Nationally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. home sale prices
climbed up by 5 percent in the year ended in September, much
faster than inflation, with a handful of cities in the South and
Midwest reporting double-digit increases over the past year.
</P>
<P>
The nation-wide the median price of an existing home increased
5 percent over the year to 126,500 dollars, the National
Association of Realtors said today. Meanwhile, consumer prices
overall rose just 2.2 percent over that period.
</P>
<P>
Of 136 metropolitan areas surveyed by the association, only 13
reported declines. And three of the nation's four broad regions
reported price appreciation even greater than the national
average.
</P>
<P>
In the South, the median price rose 6.9 percent to 112,300
dollars; in the Midwest, 5.5 percent to 108,100 dollars; in the
West, 5.2 percent to 163,000 dollars, and in the Northeast, 3.4
percent to 147,400 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Waterloo of Iowa state, led the nation in price appreciation,
with values jumping 17.2 percent. It was followed by Kalamazoo,
Michigan, 14.5 percent; New Orleans and Fort Lauderdale, Florida,
both 11.3 percent, and Memphis, Tennessee, 11.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Norfolk, Virginia, had the sharpest decline, 11.9 percent. It
was followed by Honolulu, 6 percent; Beaumont, Texas, 4.4 percent;
El Paso, Texas, and Hartford, Connecticut, both 3.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The five metro areas with the highest median prices in the
July-September quarter were Honolulu, 315,000 dollars; San
Francisco, 300,600 dollars; Orange County, California, 233,000
dollars; New York, 212,500 dollars, and Boston, 204,400 dollars.
</P>
<P>

dollars; Beaumont, Texas, 67,100 dollars; Waterloo, Iowa, 68,200
dollars; Davenport, Iowa, 71,700 dollars, and Daytona Beach,
Florida, 73,600 dollars.

<P>
LONDON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
ended higher Monday, supported by Asian markets' only moderate
losses and Wall Street's early gains.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index managed to close the day above the
4,800-point level at 4,806.8, up 42.5 points after drifting during
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that calmer Asian markets and Wall Street's
moderate rally helped underpin market sentiment.
</P>
<P>
However, with the South Korean market still volatile, investors
remained cautious. Meanwhile, they were nervous ahead of this
Wednesday's US Federal Reserve's monetary meeting.
</P>
<P>
German shares in Frankfurt also ended sharply higher, with the
DAX-30 index up 52.64 points at 3,752.53, boosted by the firmer
dollar which is favorable for German exporters and by hopes that
Asian markets are starting to stabilise.
</P>
<P>
But dealers said that market sentiment remained fragile and
trading volumes were thin.
</P>
<P>
French markets are closed Monday and Tuesday for the Armistice
holiday.

<HEADLINE> UK Labor to Hand Back F1 Chief's Donation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain's ruling Labor party
said today it would return a controversial donation from chief of
Formula One motor racing Bernie Ecclestone.
</P>
<P>
The party's general secretary Tom Sawyer told reporters a
donation from Ecclestone, president of the Formula One
Constructors Association, would be paid back.
</P>
<P>
He said the move was taken after consulting with Sir Patrick
Neill, Britain's official watchdog on political ethics.
</P>
<P>
Sir Patrick, chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public
Life, told Labor it would be wrong and unfair to criticize
Ecclestone's donation -- whose scale remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
But he recommended that in order to avoid even the appearance
of influence-peddling the money should be given back.
</P>
<P>
Although Ecclestone said he had never sought any favors from
the party or the government, question has been asked about links
between Labor and Formula One over the decision not to ban tobacco
advertisement.
</P>
<P>
Last week Tessa Jowell, a junior health minister, said the
pledge to ban Formula One tobacco sponsorship had been dropped as
a matter of "practical politics" because of the risk that the
sport might move out of Europe to the Far East.
</P>
<P>
Most Formula One teams are based in Britain, and Finance
Minister Gordon Brown said today their activities provided 50,000
jobs.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco advertisers, who are barred from using television
directly in most of Europe, see Formula One as a vital way of
reaching a worldwide television audience.
</P>
<P>
Anti-smoking groups condemned the move and the European
Commission said it was disappointed, but cigarette manufacturers,
who pump an estimated 100 million pounds (170 million U.S.
dollars) into Formula One each year, praised the announcement.

NEW YORK, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street
retreated from an early rally and fell modestly today, with the
Dow Jones industrial average dropping 28.73 points to 7,552.59.

<P>
The Dow surrendered an opening 75-point gain. It was the third
straight losing session for the Dow, which lost 102 points on

around the world.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with the volume totaling 463.42
million shares as against 564.10 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 6.38 to 921.13, the
NYSE composite index fell 2.42 to 484.87, and the Nasdaq composite
index fell 11.68 to 1,590.72.

But the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.18 to
435.40, and the American Stock Exchange composite index was up
2.20 to 680.47.

<P>
With no economic reports scheduled for today or Tuesday, the
highlight of the session was an agreement by MCI to be bought by
WorldCom for 37 billion U.S. dollars in stock.
