<HEADLINE> German Citizen Convicted of Aiding Hezbollah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 17 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli Court Tuesday
convicted a German citizen of being a member of Hezbollah and
conspiring with it to attack Israel, Israeli television reported.
</P>
<P>
Steven Smyrek, 26, an Islamic convert and former German
soldier, was convicted by a Tel Aviv district court of aiding
Hezbollah and trying to pass information about Israel to it.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that Smyrek had taken pictures of public
places in Israel in a bid to help Hezbollah choose targets for
possible terror attacks, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to Israel Radio, the three-judge panel unanimously
passed the ruling and said the "prosecution proved beyond a doubt
the base for conviction."
</P>
<P>
The court, however, dismissed allegations that Smyrek was
plotting a suicide bomb attack himself in a public place in
Israel. The court will possibly deliver a sentence after hearing
arguments between the prosecution and the defense.
</P>
<P>
Smyrek was arrested in November 1997 upon arrival at the Ben
Gurion airport. He admitted that he had received training with
Hezbollah in Lebanon, but Hezbollah denied after his arrest that
Smyrek worked for it.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, is leading a war of attrition to
oust Israeli troops and their local militia South Lebanon Army
from the so-called security zone Israel carved out in south
Lebanon in 1985 with a claimed aim of protecting northern Israel
from cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> Mbeki Stresses Regional Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, August 17 (xinhua) -- Regional cooperation is not just
the responsibility of governments, South African President Thabo
Mbeki said Tuesday at the meeting marking the 19th birthday of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
"It's the responsibility of both the government and the
people," said Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
The South African President, who currently chairs the regional
organization, agreed with his Mozambican counterpart Joaquim
Chissano that everybody should join hands in this common effort,
stressing that the southern African countries depend on one
another for development and progress.
</P>
<P>
"We have met to say South Africa cannot progress unless Lesotho
 progresses, that Botswana cannot progress unless South Africa
progresses," etc., he noted.
</P>
<P>
"It's the same for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for
Zambia, for Tanzania, for Seychelles, for Mauritius, for
Swaziland, and for all the member states of SADC," he said.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state and government of SADC will meet Wednesday,
among other things, on further strengthening the regional bloc in
order to ensure that all the SADC member countries achieve peace,
progress and prosperity in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the idea of cooperation between the SADC and the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) forwarded by
honored guest Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, Mbeki said
that "we will pay careful attention to the proposal."
</P>
<P>
He said measures will be taken for the cooperation between the
two sub- regions

<HEADLINE> Japan to Resume Loan to Iran for Dam Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Japan is to resume providing for
Iran 705 billion yen (about 6 billion U.S. dollars) in
low-interest loan for building the "Karoun-4" dam in the western
province of Khuzestan.
</P>
<P>
This was released here Tuesday by Asahiso Kawamora, spokesman
of the Japanese delegation headed by Foreign Minister Masakiko
Komura, who is on a three-day visit to Iran, according to the
Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The two countries reached an agreement in early 1990s on
Japan's low-interest loan for the construction of the Karoun
hydroelectric power plant. But after paying its first portion
of 38.6 billion yen (about 336 million U.S. dollars), Tokyo
froze the loan in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The unfreezing of the loan by Japan is a result of
Komura's visit, the first in years, and is indicative of a
new attitude toward Iran, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese spokesman said the two sides had discussed
various topics on political and economic affairs in addition
to the dialog between nations advocated by moderate President
Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Kawamora said the Japanese government invited Khatami to visit
Tokyo next year and the Iranian president had accepted the
invitation.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran's reforms offered the Japanese government an
incentive to visit Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Japanese minister was carrying a message from
Washington to Tehran, the spokesman said he had never been
given such a commission by the United States.

U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The period of payment of the remaining 407 billion Kwacha
Zambia owes Germany has been extended for 16 more years.
</P>
<P>
An agreement to the effect was signed here Tuesday.

After signing the agreement Zambian Finance Minister Katele
Kalumba said that the debt cancellation is a great contribution to
his country's economic development and will ease Zambian
government's budgetary external debt service obligation.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is paying greater attention to spending
funds in favor of economic infrastructure and poverty reduction
and urged the government departments to start putting in place
cost-serving measures such as the aggressive implementation of
public sector reform program.
</P>
<P>
Bernhard Zisese, Director of the Federal Ministry of Finance of
Germany, said after signing the agreement that the writing off of
Zambia's debt is part of the Neapel conditions that will see 67
percent of Zambia's debt cancelled.

<HEADLINE> 19 Iraqi Civilians Killed in U.S.-British Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Nineteen Iraqi civilians were
killed and 11 others injured on Tuesday in attacks by U.S. and
British warplanes on residential areas and civilian facilities in
northern and southern Iraq, the Iraqi News Agency INA reported.
</P>
<P>
At 10:35 (0635 GMT) 11 formations of U.S. and British warplanes
coming from Turkish airspace violated northern Iraqi airspace over
Neineva, Erbil and Dohuk provinces, said an Iraqi military
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The fighter jets attacked some civilian and service facilities,
residential areas as well as military sites in the region, some
of the targets are not in the no-fly zone, killing eight civilians
and injuring nine others.
</P>
<P>
At 14:07 (1007 GMT) 12 formations of U.S. and British warplanes
coming from Saudi and Kuwaiti bases violated southern Iraqi
airspace over Basrah, Thi-Qar, Qadisiyah, Misan and Wasit
provinces, causing one injury.
</P>
<P>
They attacked a residential area in Jassan district in the
southern Iraqi province of Wasit, killing 11 residents and
injuring another.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi anti-aircraft units fired back at the enemy planes and
forced them to flee to their bases, he added.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's airstrikes against Iraq, U.S. and
British warplanes have made over 11,500 sorties over the two
no-fly zones in Iraq, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
And they have been regularly attacking Iraqi civilian
facilities and military sites, causing severe civilian casualties
and property damages.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led western
allies following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south from attacks by Iraqi government troops.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 17 (Xinhua) -- In an effort to boost Iran's
non-oil exports, the country's flag carrier Iran Air is to cut
down by 15 percent air freight rates for hand-woven carpets and
air fares for passengers introduced by the Export Promotion Center.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA),
the discounts will be effective for two months until October 17
for both Iranian and foreign nationals.

<P>
Iran is famous for its hand-woven Persian carpets, whose craft
dates back more than one thousand years ago. It now accounts for
31 percent of the world trade of carpets.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said authorization for discounted rates will have to be
collected by each passenger or exporter at Iran's Export
Promotion Center in northern Tehran.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meet on Western Sahara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Tuesday reaffirmed its support for the holding of the
referendum in Western Sahara.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press, the president of the Security
Council, Martin Andjaba of Namibia, said that members of the
Security Council heard a briefing by Assistant Secretary-General
Hedi Annabi and considered a report by the U.N. Secretary-General
on the latest development in Western Sahara.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Council took note of the progress achieved in
the implementation of the Settlement Plan for Western Sahara,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after the U.N. Security Council Tuesday met
in a closed-door session to discuss the latest report by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has reported progress made by
the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara
(MINURSO), but efforts are under way to build confidence in the
region.
</P>
<P>
In his written report to the Security Council Monday, Annan
said, "The resumption of the identification operation and the
initiation of the appeals process, as well as the publication of
the first part of the provisional voters list, have been
achieved."
</P>
<P>
At present, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees
(UNHCR) and MINURSO are taking steps to prepare for the
repatriation of refugees in cooperation with parties concerned,
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"It is now important that confidence-building measures be
implemented promptly through the establishment of communication
facilities and visits," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, it should be recognized that delays in
solving certain issues in the identification operation, the
staggered opening of the appeals centers, compounded by
difficulties in meeting the staff requirements, have affected
parties of the timetable for the referendum process," he said.
</P>
<P>
By August 9, the military component of MINURSO stood at 230
military observers and other personnel. "Under the commend of
Major General Bernd S. Lubenik of Austria, the component continued
to monitor the ceasefire between the Royal Moroccan Army and the
Frente POLISARIO forces, which remains calm and there have been no
indications that either side intends to resume hostilities in the
near future," he said.
</P>
<P>
The much-delayed U.N.-brokered referendum in Western Sahara,
originally scheduled for January 1992, is not expected to take
place before July 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 17 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian state security court
on Tuesday began trial of 31 Egyptians and one Libyan charged with
smuggling and illegally acquiring arms.
</P>
<P>
After the first session of hearings in the day, the State
Security Misdemeanor Court in Alexandria, a Mediterranean port
city 220 kilometers northwest of Cairo, decided to continue the
trial on September 19, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen of the men were arrested on April 26 as they tried to
cross into Egypt from Libya through the el-Salloum checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
Police said the men had concealed 49 guns, including automatic
rifles, in their bags.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen other men, who had been identified by the 13
defendants during interrogations, also stood for trial.
</P>
<P>
Six of the defendants were charged with arms smuggling, an
offense that is usually punished by life imprisonment with hard
labor.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 26 were charged with illegally acquiring weapons,
usually punished by 15 years in prison with hard labor.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the men bought the weapons from Omar al-Salmani,
a Libyan soldier who worked as a guard of a Libyan weapons depot.
Al-Salmani is reported to have been executed recently in Libya for
stealing weapons.

<HEADLINE> Primakov Agrees to Head Fatherland-All Russia Bloc </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Former Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov on Tuesday declared his consent to head the coordinating
council of the Fatherland-All Russia alliance in a move that would
have major implications in Russia's political landscape.
</P>
<P>
Mayor of Moscow Yuri Luzhkov is in second and Governor of
St.Petersburg Vladimir Yakovlev in third place.
</P>
<P>
Luzhkov and Primakov are seen as two of the strongest potential
candidates in next year's presidential poll, although neither has
formally announced plans to run.
</P>
<P>
Luzhkov's Fatherland movement recently united with the "All
Russia" movement, a powerful bloc of regional governors, and
Primakov's addition will make the coalition even stronger.
</P>
<P>
Primakov thanked the bloc leadership for the trust vested in
him and promised "to use all his strength and experience to ensure
that the coalition gains a well-deserved victory in the upcoming
parliamentary elections," the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that his decision to head the council
"does not mean that I have joined one of the parties or
movements."
</P>
<P>
That could obstruct these organizations' unification in one
election source and later impede a stable unity of Centrist forces
in the State Duma, Primakov said in a statement, adding that
"entering a particular movement is unacceptable for me
personally."
</P>
<P>
Primakov listed four major tasks ahead: the creation of a
favorable atmosphere for the new Duma's law-making activity; the
promotion of synergy between the Duma and the government; the
revision of the Constitution and the strengthening of the
statehood; and the preservation of the country's integrity in
combination with federalism.
</P>
<P>
He said the amendments to the constitution should envision a
transfer of part of the presidential powers to the government and
parliament and the institution of a vice president.
</P>
<P>
Primakov also advocates either a Constitutional amendment or a
law that would guarantee former Russian presidents complete safety
and an appropriate life, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Primakov also vowed to boost Russia's
security.
</P>
<P>
""The armed forces must be in the center of public attention,
not because we are threatening someone but because we do not want
to be threatened," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Negotiations With Savimbi Impossible: Angolan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Angolan President Jose Eduardo
Dos Santos Tuesday rejected the possibility of negotiating with
Jonas Savimbi, leader of the rebel National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Civil war broke out again between government forces and UNITA
troops since December last year after the UNITA refused to
implement the 1994 Lusaka peace accord which ended the civil war
since 1975.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing for negotiating, ... but the Lusaka Protocol should be
 implemented," said Dos Santos in a speech at the Summit of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC), which opened
Tuesday in Maputo, the capital of Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The president added that above all, Savimbi's troops should be
disarmed in accordance with the protocol.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government and the rebel UNITA signed the Lusaka
Protocol in November,1994 in an effort to end the long-drawn-out
civil war, but Luanda declared it to be a failure in late 1998
when fighting renewed in Angola.

<HEADLINE> China Says Banning Falun Gong Aiming at Defending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador in London Ma
Zhengang said on Tuesday that the Chinese government's decision to
ban Falun Gong sect was aimed at protecting the Chinese people's
human rights and maintaining social stability.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that since the banning of the
illegal sect, the over-whelming majority of Falun Gong
practitioners have seen through the true features of this
organization and broken away from it.
</P>
<P>
China's Civil Affairs Ministry issued a decision on July 22,
banning the Research Society of Falun Dafa and the Falun Gong
organization under its control after judging them to be illegal.
Later, the Public Security Ministry issued an arrest warrant for
crime suspect Li Hongzhi, founder of Falun Gong sect.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said: "Falun Gong is neither a real Qigong sect
nor a normal religious practice, but rather a cult organization
with political motives."
</P>
<P>
He said Li Hongzhi and his Falun Gong organization, with
ulterior motives, had engaged in illegal activities, incited and
created disturbances frequently, thus severely undermining social
stability.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government's decision to ban the sect has won warm
acclamation all over the country," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador hoped the international community would
also see through the true features of Falun Gong sect, understand
and support the Chinese government's decision.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Asks Members to Reschedule FM Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League has asked its
members to reschedule the next foreign ministers' meeting which
had been scheduled on September 4-5, a league spokesman said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Talaat Hamid said intensive contacts are underway to set a new
date for the bi-annual meeting in Cairo, which will be chaired by
Iraq under the league's rotational system.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal on Sunday asked
the league to postpone the meeting to September 13, saying that
he can only attend the meeting that day.
</P>
<P>
The move appears to underline unease felt by Saudi Arabia and
its Gulf allies to attend a meeting chaired by Iraq, which they
have been trying to punish for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-based league has issued invitations to the foreign
ministers of its 22 members to attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's turn to chair the meeting is bound to strike
apprehension among its bitter rivals, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia,
which have blocked Arab League proposals in support of Iraq in its
campaign to have the nearly nine-year-long U.N. economic sanctions
lifted.
</P>
<P>
If the Saudi foreign minister does not attend the meeting, his
Gulf counterparts in Kuwait, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates,
Bahrain and Oman may follow suit, sending low-level envoys to head
their delegations instead.
</P>
<P>
Such a boycott would deprive Iraq of an important diplomatic
victory and would deny President Saddam Hussein an opportunity to
make Iraq heard by other members.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League convenes regular foreign ministers' meetings in
March and September.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- French police Tuesday continued
investigation on the deadly stunt car accident which killed a
cameraman during the shooting of the thriller "Taxi 2" in Paris on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Police have questioned since Monday Remy Julienne, who was in
charge of stunt in the shooting of "Taxi 2", and the film's
conductor Gerard Krawczyk, while an autopsy of the body of Alain
Dutartre, 41, was conducted on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dutartre was killed after being hit by the stuntman's car
flying from a springboard and overshooting its target by
nosediving into a group of film crew.
</P>
<P>
Dutartre's assistant, Jean-Michel Bar, who had both his legs
broken after being hit by the stunt car, will have an operation on
Tuesday and will also be asked to give his version of the accident
as soon as his health allows, said police.
</P>
<P>
The driver of the Peugeot 406 stunt car, who is also injured in
the accident, was reduced to a state of shock.
</P>
<P>
According to the film script, the car was supposed to jump from
a springboard over three army tanks before landing on a heap of
cardboard.
</P>
<P>
The first try was not judged satisfactory, as the car, equipped
with an aerofoil, did not fly high enough and landed before
reaching the cardboard.
</P>
<P>
For an unknown reason, the car overshot on the second try and
landed 15 to 20 meters ahead of the fixed area with a speed of 100
to 120 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
The schedule to shoot the remaining part of "Taxi 2" in
Marseille has been postponed for a short period of time, said the
film producer, Luc Besson.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Concerned at Conflict in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Tuesday voiced its concerns at the eruption of fighting in
Kisangani, the Democratic Republic of Congo, between troops from
Rwanda and Uganda and the Congolese rebel factions, and demanded
an immediate end to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press, the president of the Council,
Martin Andjaba of Namibia, said, "Members of the Council expressed
serious concern at the eruption of fighting in Kisangani,
Democratic Republic of the Congo, reportedly between troops from
Rwanda and Uganda and the Congolese rebel factions."
</P>
<P>
The statement came after the 15-nation Security Council were
briefed by the U.N. Secretariat on the situation in Congo (K),
former Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The Council members "were particularly concerned that the
fighting has disrupted the national immunization days following a
request by the Secretary-General, which were supposed to provide
the opportunity for some 10 million children to be immunized
against polio, in violation of international humanitarian law,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Council regretted the loss of life of innocent
civilians," the statement said. "They called upon all parties to
ensure that humanitarian agencies have access to the wounded and
to those trapped by the recent outbreak."
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Council demanded an immediate halt to the
fighting and called upon all parties to abide by the provisions of
the ceasefire agreement on the Democratic Republic of Congo, which
they signed in Lusaka on July 10," the statement said. "They urged
the parties to implement the reported ceasefire announced today."
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Council called upon the leaders of the
Congolese Rally for Democracy to resolve their differences and to
sign the ceasefire agreement on the Democratic Republic of Congo
without further delay and abide by its provisions," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
"They called upon all concerned to ensure respect for human
rights and international humanitarian law," th statement said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan Monday said that weekend
fighting in the Democratic Republic of Congo violated a truce to
enable millions of children to be vaccinated against polio.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here through his spokesman, Annan said,
"It is unacceptable that this fighting is taking place during the
national immunization days, which were supposed to provide the
opportunity for some 10 million children to be immunized against
polio."
</P>
<P>
"This development violates a truce for the period of August 2
to 20 endorsed by all parties following a request made by the
secretary-general," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Six African countries involved in a year-long rebellion in
Congo (K) signed a ceasefire accord in Lusaka, the Zambian
capital, on July 10. But rivalry between two factions of the rebel
Congolese Rally for Democracy opposed to President Laurent Kabila
prevented them from signing the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Israel Denies Involvement in Killing of Hezbollah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli army chief of staff
Shaul Mofaz Tuesday denied charges that Israel was behind the
bombing death of a senior Hezbollah official in south Lebanon,
saying the killing was possibly an internal struggle in
Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli army does not get involved in internal disputes
between terrorist organizations in Lebanon," Mofaz told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Two roadside bombs exploded outside the port city of Sidon in
Lebanon Monday afternoon, killing Ali Hassan Deeb, the
coordinator for Hezbollah operations in south Lebanon. He had
been on the top of Israel's most wanted list for carrying out
attacks against the Israeli army in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah blamed Israel for the bombing attack and vowed
retaliation, but Mofaz said he suspected that Deeb had been blown
up by a rival group in Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Yossi Beilin said on Israeli television that
Israel is not the only enemy of Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, is leading a war of attrition to
oust Israeli troops and their local militia South Lebanon Army
from the so-called security zone Israel carved out in south
Lebanon in 1985 with a claimed aim of protecting northern Israel
from cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army gave no orders to residents of the north to
take to bomb shelters overnight following Deeb's
killing. Hezbollah guerrillas often fired rockets and mortars into
northern Israel in retaliation.
</P>
<P>
Israeli radio and television reports said there was
intensified fighting between the Israeli army and Hezbollah
guerrillas in southern Lebanon Tuesday, but they did not confirm
nor deny reports from Lebanon that one Israeli soldier was killed
and three others were injured in the clash in the occupation
zone.

<HEADLINE> Romania Rejects US Accusation of Selling Steel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Romanian steel tubes producers
rejected the accusation of having sold steel tubes at dumping
prices in the United States, saying the accusation is groundless.
</P>
<P>
"Romania's output is not so high as to affect the American
market," general manager of Metanef SA Stefan Marginean was quoted
Tuesday by the official Rompres news agency as saying. Metanef SA
is one of the main producers of steel tubes of Romania.
</P>
<P>
The production in metallurgy, including the stock was worth
71,092 billion lei (about 4,443 billion U.S. dollars) over
January-June, of which 4,916 billion lei (307 million U.S.
dollars) worth of tubes went to export, Stefan Marginean said,
adding that the output dropped from the similar period of last
year. It stood at 62 percent of that of the first six month of
1998.
</P>
<P>
The exports of crude iron, iron and steel were worth 258
million U.S. dollars, or 59 percent of the exports of the first
six months of 1998, when the exports of products of crude iron,
iron and steel dropped 32 percent compared to the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Commission for International Trade of the United
States accused Romania, together with Japan, Mexico, Czech
Republic and South Africa, of having sold steel at dumping prices
on the American market. The case is now being studied by the U.S.
Department of Commerce and a decision regarding the dumping price
is to be made around December 7.

<HEADLINE> Uganda, Rwanda Agree to Cease Fire Between them in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Uganda and Rwanda agreed Tuesday
evening on a cease-fire between the two armed forces in Kisangani
in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached after marathon talks between Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni and Rwandan Vice President and Minister
of Defense Paul Kagame in western Uganda, Uganda's presidential
office said.
</P>
<P>
The two governments agreed on the modalities for the
implementation of the cease-fire and on no more verbal battles in
the media by officials of either country.
</P>
<P>
They also reaffirmed their commitment to cooperate with the
verification teams from Zambia and South Africa and agreed upon a
common position on the question of securing signatures to the
Lusaka cease-fire accord.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also reaffirmed their commitment to the
peaceful resolution of the conflict in the Congo and to quick
implementation of the Lusaka's cease-fire accord signed on July 10
by six relevant states.
</P>
<P>
Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF) and Rwanda Patriotic Army
(RPA) have been involved in clashes in Kisangani, a conspicuous
indication of the two neighbors' difference over the strategies to
be used in the Congo.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the two traditional allies agreed to halt
hostilities in the central African country. However, the
atmosphere in Kisangani remains tense with all the troops of the
two sides put on full alert.
</P>
<P>
After the main rebel group -- the Congolese Rally for Democracy
-- split into two headed by Emile IIlunga and Wamba dia Wamba
respectively in mid-May, Uganda and Rwanda began to back rival
factions.
</P>
<P>
They have been trading accusations and harsh words about each
other ever since. The latest exchange of gunfire prompted the two
leaders to meet in a bid to narrow their differences.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Renews Condemnation of U.S. Attack on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Sudan on Tuesday renewed it
condemnation of the U.S. air strike against Al-Shefaa
Pharmaceutical Factory in Khartoum under the pretext of it
production of chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on the occasion of the first anniversary
of the air strike, the Sudanese Foreign Ministry urged the
U.N. Security Council to shoulder its full responsibility and sent
a fact-finding mission to Sudan to define the nature of the
destroyed factory.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration should accept the results of the
fact-finding committee and compensate for the human and material
damage inflicted on Sudan by the missile attack, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
"The world became fully aware of the fallacy of the
U.S. allegations and the unseemly reasoning on which the United
States based its attack against the plant," it added, noting that
the United States is still fabricating charges against Sudan and
inciting Sudan's neighbors to maintain the embargo on the east
African country.
</P>
<P>
The statement called on the international community to help
Sudan defense its sovereignty and territorial integrity and
to support its efforts aimed at halting the U.S. hostile acts.
</P>
<P>
It also urged "the international family" to bring pressure on
the United States until the latter respects the international
legitimacy and stop its threats to the sovereignty of other states.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Sudanese Foreign Ministry called on the United
States to shoulder its responsibility as a superpower for
preserving international security and peace.
</P>
<P>
The United States has maintained a flagrant intransigence and
neglected institutional and constitutional developments in
Sudan over the last ten years, the statement pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Among such developments are the national reconciliation
initiatives, dialogues, the multi-party politics, the improvement
of relations with neighboring countries as well as with the
European Union, the cooperation with the Organization of African
Unity in the human relief area, and the protection of human
rights, it noted.
</P>
<P>
The statement underlined that the developments were praised by
the U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
The United States launched a missile attack on the Shefaa plant
on August 20, 1998, alleging that it was a terrorist base and
accusing Sudan of involvement in the bombing of the two
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Sudan denied the charges categorically and called from the very
beginning on the U.N. Security Council to send a fact-finding
mission to prove its innocence.

<HEADLINE> Pornography on Internet Causing Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 17(Xinhua) -- Child pornography on the internet
continues to be a matter of concern both regionally and
internationally, a Norwegian official from the Center for
Prevention of Child Sexual Abuse said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing participants to a conference on the prevention of
abuse on women and children which ends Wednesday, Lars Gronseth,
Deputy Director of information for the Save Children's Project in
Norway said experience had shown that a huge amount of documented
abuse of children was being distributed through the internet on
web sites.
</P>
<P>
He said the lack of legislation in different countries made it
difficult to stop and that lack of experience in the police with
these kinds of crimes made it difficult to combat.
</P>
<P>
"Until production, distribution and possession of child
pornography is illegal in every country in the world, this is a
lost battle. My hope is that people in Africa also will join this
fight and help to save the children," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gronseth said the most important resource on this battle at the
moment are the net users themselves.
</P>
<P>
As the number of internet users grows, so do the risks of
children being exposed to inappropriate materials, in particular
criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
At present not enough was known about the scale or extent of
pornographic activities on the net, their consequences and impact
on young people.
</P>
<P>
Global estimates showed that 200 million users would be
connected to the net by the year 2001 from 20 million in 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Tuesday met in a closed-door session to discuss a latest report by
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has reported progress made
by the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara
(MINURSO), but efforts are under way to build confidence in the
region.
</P>
<P>
In his written report to the Security Council Monday, Annan
said, "The resumption of the identification operation and the
initiation of the appeals process, as well as the publication of
the first part of the provisional voters list, have been
achieved."
</P>
<P>
At present, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees
(UNHCR) and MINURSO are taking steps to prepare for the
repatriation of refugees in cooperation with parties concerned,
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"It is now important that confidence-building measures be
implemented promptly through the establishment of communication
facilities and visits," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, it should be recognized that delays in
solving certain issues in the identification operation, the
staggered opening of the appeals centers, compounded by
difficulties in meeting the staff requirements, have affected
parties of the timetable for the referendum process," he said.
</P>
<P>
By August 9, the military component of MINURSO stood at 230
military observers and other personnel. "Under the commend of
Major General Bernd S. Lubenik of Austria, the component continued
to monitor the ceasefire between the Royal Moroccan Army and the
Frente POLISARIO forces, which remains calm and there have been no
indications that either side intends to resume hostilities in the
near future," he said.
</P>
<P>
The much-delayed U.N.-brokered referendum in Western Sahara,
originally scheduled for January 1992, is not expected to take
place before July 2000.

<HEADLINE> Austrian Defense Minister on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Defense Minister
Werner Fasslabend Tuesday expressed the wish that there would
come new political movement, a unifying process for Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Cyprus' Larnaca airport, Fasslabend said ways
should be found for people in Cyprus to live together in the
future, noting however that such task is not easy to achieve.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Fasslabend is in Cyprus to mark the 25th anniversary of the
death of three Austrian soldiers, killed in Larnaca district,
while on patrol during the 1974 Turkish invasion.
</P>
<P>
The three soldiers were serving in the Austrian contingent of
the U.N. Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP).
</P>
<P>
"This is an occasion to think over the whole situation,
especially to think of the people who had to give their lives in
order to try to bring a little bit of peace and stability here to
the situation," Fasslabend said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he will not meet any Cypriot government
officials because he will be in Cyprus for a short time. He is
expected to leave Wednesday for Lebanon to inspect the Austrian
peace-keepers there.
</P>
<P>
He said his message to Cypriots is that they will "have to
live together" in the future.
</P>
<P>
Fasslabend, who is accompanied by a 12-member delegation, said
he will not visit the northern Cyprus during his visit.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to meet U.N. Special Representative for Cyprus
Dame Ann Hercus, and UNFICYP commander Major-General Evergisto
Arturo de Vergara.
</P>
<P>
Fasslabend will also inspect the 250-strong Austrian
contingent.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Help Uganda Combat Nile Weeds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 17 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian minister said on
Tuesday that Egypt is to help Uganda combat weeds in the Nile by
providing it with a fund to buy equipment in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Public Works and Water Resources Mahmoud Abu Zeid
told visiting Ugandan officials that Egypt will grant 13.9 million
U.S. dollars for their country to buy the equipment for combating
the water-sucking hyacinth weed in the Nile, Egypt's Middle East
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Abu Zeid reviewed the specifications of the equipment needed in
the weed-combating with the officials from Uganda's ministries of
agriculture and water resources.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the Ugandan officials, who arrived in Cairo
earlier in the day, briefed Abu Zeid on the problem of hyacinth,
which blocks the Nile River in the Great Lakes region, especially
during the rain season.
</P>
<P>
Water weeds are known to accelerate water evaporation in
addition to being an irritating hurdle to fishing, especially in
the Great Lakes region where fish is a staple diet.
</P>
<P>
Hyacinth also blocks river navigation routes linking Uganda
with Tanzania and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Ministry of Public Works and Water Resources signed
with the Ugandan Ministry of Agriculture last March an agreement
on cooperation in combating weeds in the Nile in Uganda.

<HEADLINE> Privatized Firms Creating More Jobs in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- More and more jobs are creating
by privatized companies in the country, the Zambia Privatization
(ZPA) Agency has said.
</P>
<P>
Acting ZPA chief executive Stuart Cruickshank told reporters in
a press conference here Tuesday that the privatization program has
been successful since a lot of jobs were saved which would not
have been the case if the companies were allowed to collapse, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that job losses has been fairly small compared to
the liberalization programs in other countries.
</P>
<P>
He said though 3,000 jobs in the trading sector had been lost,
the sector created 4,500 jobs after the privatization and there
has been the knock-on effect which has also created more jobs.
</P>
<P>
Many companies have set up other smaller companies which has
created numerous jobs in all sectors in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cruickshank further said ZPA was in the process of working with
private donors to check on the post privatization effect.
</P>
<P>
He said there is need to monitor all companies that were sold
so that an overall picture can be gotten through the collection of
data.
</P>
<P>
According to the ZPA, the majority of participants in the
Zambia privatization program are locals who have purchased small-
and medium-size state-owned assets covering the entire spectrum of
the economy.
</P>
<P>
Out of 250 companies and units privatized by the ZPA, 65
percent have been bought by Zambian citizens while the remaining
35 percent have been bought by foreign investors who bought mostly
larger companies.

<HEADLINE> Iran Bears No Enmity Against US: Khatami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami on Tuesday again signaled his hallmark detente with the
U.S., saying Iran has "no enmity against American nation."
</P>
<P>
"Rather we respect them and welcome cultural, social and
sports relations between the two nations," Khatami said in a
meeting with visiting Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura,
who is here on a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Since taking office two years ago, the moderate Iranian
president has been advocating a dialog between the two nations,
while ruling out the possibility of talks between the two
governments in the offing.
</P>
<P>
"Americans have done many injustices toward us and it is
natural that as long as the injustices are not compensated in
practice, the wall of mistrust will not be removed," Khatami was
quoted by the official Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He criticized American policy makers for changing their
words only, but not deeds toward Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran and the U.S. severed their relations in 1980 and the
U.S. has kept its sanctions against Iran intact.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. accuses Iran of producing mass destruction weapons
and violating human rights and at the same time wants it to sit
down at negotiating table," Khatami complained.
</P>
<P>
"Our defense budget is less than that of all the regional
states; as far as atomic energy is concerned, Iran's activity is
under full supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency,
while Israel, which has nuclear weapons, is not ready to be
submissive to them," he protested.
</P>
<P>
He accused West countries of trying to unilaterally impose
their policies on other nations despite they are "double-standard
and discriminatory."
</P>
<P>
However, Iran is firmly determined to follow the policy of
detente.
</P>
<P>
"Decreasing enmities and increasing friendship will be
continued unabated at any cost due to ideological beliefs and
principled policies," he added.
</P>
<P>
Khatami told the Japanese minister that Iran welcomes
expansion of relations with Tokyo in all fields.
</P>
<P>
" Iran hopes to get more much-needed investments from Japan, a
close ally of the U.S.," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran and Japan, both Asian countries, are inter-linked
in their destiny, and hoped Komura's visit, the first in years,
would mark a new phase in good bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The president also said Iran is to turn itself into a
democratic and civil society. There have been a number of
problems, he said, but "patience, persistence and prudence are the
road to victory."
</P>
<P>
On his part, Komura welcomed Khatami's proposal of dialog
among civilizations and praised his efforts in sponsoring reforms
and improving Iran's relations with regional and European
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese minister arrived here on Monday. On Tuesday, he
met with his Iranian counterpart Kamal Kharrazi, former President
Hashemi Rafsanjani and Majlis (parliament) speaker Ali Akbar
Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, Komura
invited Khatami to visit Japan.

JOHANNESBURG, August 17 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's year-on-year
consumer inflation rate dropped to 4.9 percent in July, the lowest
since March 1970, Statistics South Africa announced Tuesday.

<P>
The rate, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, was 2.4
percentage points lower than the corresponding annual rate of 7.3
percent recorded in June this year.
</P>
<P>
The agency explained that this decrease was mainly caused by a
relative decrease of three percent in the interest rates on

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Negotiators Meet on Wye </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators met Tuesday in a continued effort to work out a
timetable for the implementation of the U.S.-brokered Wye
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak's envoy Gilad Sher and senior
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat resumed their talks in
Jerusalem Tuesday afternoon after they failed to resolve their
difference on the timetable in their negotiations at the Erez
border crossing Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Since taking office on July 6, Barak has promised to carry out
the Wye agreement, signed and then frozen by his hard-line
predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu last year, but proposed some
changes to the accord, under which Israel has to hand over 13
percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have reluctantly accepted his proposal to
begin implementation of the agreement at the beginning of
September and carry out the second stage of troop withdrawal on
October 1.
</P>
<P>
But the two sides have been at odds over Barak's proposal to
postpone the final stage of the deal until February 2000, when
the final-status talks dealing with thorny issues like Jerusalem
and settlements are supposed to have been well under way.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have rejected the delay and called on Barak
to complete the implementation of the final stage by mid-November
in line with the original timetable of the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
During their talks Sunday, Sher and Erekat failed to make a
breakthrough on the withdrawal issue but made progress on some
secondary issues, including the release of Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
A joint Israeli-Palestinian committee met Tuesday for the
first time to discuss the issue of prisoners amid signs that
Israel might agree to release the so-called "security prisoners,"
referring to those Palestinians who were jailed for participating
in attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami from the Labor Party
said Tuesday that there is logic in Palestinians' demand that all
security prisoners be released under the framework of a permanent
peace agreement, saying internal discussions were taking place
concerning the release of those prisoners under the Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
Israel released 250 Palestinian prisoners last November, the
first group of 750 prisoners to be released in three stages under
the Wye agreement. But most of the released were common criminals
instead of security prisoners the Palestinian National Authority
had required.
</P>
<P>
The dispute sparked weeks of bloodiest violence in years
between Palestinians and Israeli soldiers in the West Bank and
Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Israel's security cabinet will hold a special meeting
Wednesday to discuss the issue of Palestinian prisoner release,
Israeli media said.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Get Tougher with Attackers on Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Majlis (parliament) is
about to approve tougher punishments for attackers on foreign
tourists, apparently in reaction to the kidnapping of four
foreigners in the southern province of Kerman Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
It was announced here Tuesday that a number of Majlis deputies
are to present a draft bill to beef up the effort of cracking
down on abducting and attacking foreign tourists, an act seen as
tarnishing the country's image as a safe place for investment
and tourism.
</P>
<P>
The official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Mohsen Emani,
deputy head of Iran Tourism Organization, as saying that if the
bill is approved, tough punishments will wait for those offenders.
</P>
<P>
Three Spanish tourists, an Italian and an Iranian guide were
abducted from a Kerman hotel by three men and two women armed
with automatic weapons, believed to be linked with drug
trafficking. Local security forces were negotiating with the
kidnappers for their safe release.
</P>
<P>
A similar incident happened in June in the same province when
three Italians were kidnapped. They were released a week later
after the Interior Ministry intervened to negotiate with the
abductors.
</P>
<P>
There has been criticism of the dealing with kidnappers. Had
tougher measures be imposed, local newspapers said, the latest
kidnapping would not have happened.
</P>
<P>
The papers called the kidnapping as targeting Iran's security,
foreign and domestic investment as well as Iran's international
image, and urged security apparatus to find the root cause of the
problem and solve it as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry on Sunday condemned the kidnapping,
calling it an "inhuman and ugly" act.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Condemns Killing of Hezbollah Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile Lahoud
and Prime Minister Salim Hoss Tuesday strongly condemned the
killing of a senior military officer of the anti-Israeli
guerrilla group Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
"The crime which was perpetrated by the enemy (Israel) will
not affect Lebanese people's determination to defend and restore
their land," Lahoud said when meeting with visiting Saudi
Princess Muna Riyad Salah.
</P>
<P>
Hoss told reporters that it is a tragic for Lebanon to see a
great struggler fall to join the long caravan of martyrs of the
resistance.
</P>
<P>
He called the assassination a "treacherous Israeli action,"
saying Israel had habituated them to such kind of crimes which
targeted not only the country's resistance but all Lebanese
people.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah military officer Ali Deeb, known as Abu Hassan
Salameh, was killed Monday near the country's southern coastal
city of Sidon when a bomb tore apart his car.
</P>
<P>
There has been no group claiming responsibility for the
attack. Hezbollah swiftly blamed the killing on Israel and vowed
to exact revenge.
</P>
<P>
But, Israel denied any involvement in the killing and
attributed it to Hezbollah's rival groups.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli army does not get involved in internal disputes
between terrorist organizations in Lebanon," Israeli army chief of
staff Shaul Mofaz told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, is spearheading
a guerrilla group trying to oust Israeli occupation forces out of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Urges Afghan Parties to End Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Tuesday called on Afghan warring factions to
immediately end the conflict and take measures to ensure the
protection of civilians.
</P>
<P>
He also urged them to ensure the safe and free movement of
international humanitarian assistants, his deputy spokesman Manoel
de Almeida e Silva told a press briefing at the U.N. headquarters
in New York.
</P>
<P>
Annan noted that "the primary responsibility for the welfare of
the Afghan civilians rests with those who have displaced them from
their homes."
</P>
<P>
Alarmed by reports of violations affecting inhabitants of the
Shomali plain north of Kabul, the capital, the Secretary-General
strongly condemned the ongoing forceful displacement of civilians
as a result of the most recent offensive by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban movement, currently in control of 90 percent of
Afghanistan, this month launched the new offensive against the
North Alliance, but it has met strong counter-attacks.
</P>
<P>
The offensive has produced more displacements with 10,000
reported over the weekend and a further 9,000 moving into Kabul on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Continuing fighting has made Afghanistan one of the biggest
refugee sources with 2.2 million Afghans in Iran and another 1.6
million in Pakistan, according to U.N. figures.

<HEADLINE> 8 Iraqi Civilians Killed in U.S.-British Air </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Eight Iraqi civilians were
killed and 10 others injured on Tuesday in U.S.-British
warplanes' attacks on residential areas and military sites in
northern and southern Iraq, an Iraqi military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 10:35 (0635 GMT) 11 formations of
U.S. and British warplanes coming from Turkish airspace violated
northern Iraqi airspace over Neineva, Erbil and Dohuk provinces.
</P>
<P>
These warplanes attacked some civilian and service facilities,
residential areas as well as military sites in the region,
killing eight civilians and injuring nine others, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 14:07 (1007 GMT) 12 formations of
U.S.-British warplanes coming from Saudi and Kuwaiti bases
violated southern Iraqi airspace over Basrah, Thi-Qar, Qadisiyah,
Misan and Wasit provinces.
</P>
<P>
These warplanes bombed some civilian and service installations
and military sites in this region, injuring one civilian, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi anti-aircraft units fired back at the enemy planes and
forced them to flee to their bases, he added.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's airstrikes against Iraq, U.S. and
British warplanes have made over 11,500 sorties over the two
no-fly zones in Iraq, and have been regularly attacking Iraqi
civilian facilities and military sites.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led western
allies following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south from attacks by Iraqi government troops.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) is scheduled to hold a mini-summit in an
effort to end the new clashes between rebels and Liberian
government forces along the border with Guinea.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS Executive Secretary Lansana Kouyate was quoted as saying
Tuesday in Nigerian capital Abuja that the proposed summit,
involving the Mano River Union member states -- Liberia, Sierra
Leone and Guinea -- would also be attended by Ghana, Nigeria and
Togo.
</P>
<P>
"It is a serious problem involving two of our member countries
with security implications for the entire community and we cannot
allow dissidents to undermine the peace which we all fought for
in Liberia,'' Kouyate said.
</P>
<P>
Armed groups fighting against the government of President
Charles Taylor invaded Liberia last week, seizing some territories
on the country's border with Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Kouyate said that the conflicts are diverting the efforts of
the 16- nation group away from economic development and regional
integration, adding that "we should be engaged in harmonization
of policies to accelerate integration instead of dissipating
energies on mutual suspicion and conflicts.''

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh High Court Issues Contempt Rule Upon Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's High Court on Tuesday
issued rules upon the editors, printers and publishers of four
national dailies directing them to show cause why contempt
proceedings should not be drawn against them, the BSS news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The High Court directed the editors, printers and publishers
and some reporters of "Daily Sangbad (Daily News)," "Daily
Janakantha (Daily People's Voice)," "Prothom Alo (First Light),"
and "The Bangladesh Observer" to appear before the court on August
24 to explain why contempt proceedings should not be drawn against
them "for willfully publishing false and fabricated reports with
the motive to lower the image of the Supreme Court of the
country."
</P>
<P>
The rule was issued following a petition filed by senior
advocate Habibul Islam Bhuiyan.
</P>
<P>
In his petition, Bhuiyan said that Daily Sangbad on October 12,
1998, Daily Janakantha on October 12, 1998, Daily Prothom Alo on
November 4, 1998 and The Bangladesh Observer on October 6, 1998
had published false statements which lowered the image of the
highest court of the country and created confusion among the
judges and the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
A report in the Daily Star newspaper said that on August 10,
the High Court in a suo moto rule directed the editor, publisher
and printer of the Banglabazar Patrika and a dismissed employee of
the Supreme Court to be present in the court on August 25 to show
cause as to why they should not be punished for committing
contempt of court by publishing contemptuous news.
</P>
<P>
The court in the order observed that news items published in
the newspaper on August 5, 1999 under headlines "(President)
Shahabuddin (Ahmed) took oath by breaching oath," and "for
establishing rule of law Shahabuddin be impeached" contain
materials in which the Supreme Court and its judges have been
deliberately maligned and scandalized.

<HEADLINE> Russia Urges Energetic Actions Against Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Tuesday called for
"energetic and responsible actions" to halt "terrorism, separatism
and ethnic cleansing, which are under way in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
"Despite precise terms which were set by the U.N. Security
Council, violence is in full swing in Kosovo, civilian murders
multiply and arsons and robberies in non-Albanians' property
continue," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"This is the outcome of the pacification policy on the part of
several Western countries," the statement said, without referring
to specific nations.
</P>
<P>
It expressed "perplexity over a passivity of the international
tribunal for former Yugoslavia with regard to the crimes committed
in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
The statement said that "the actions of Albanian extremists
hurl a challenge to the international community and crudely
breaches U.N. Security Council resolution 1244," the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Russian ministry expressed its "concern that the process of
the Kosovo militants' disarmament is moving too slowly."
</P>
<P>
There is every ground to believe, the statement said, that "the
bulk of the arms to be laid down by the 60th day (August 20) of
demilitarization (of the Kosovo Liberation Army) will be
concealed."
</P>
<P>
The ministry warned of the risk that "the agreement on the
total disarmament of the Albanian extremists in Kosovo within 90
days will remain on paper as well."

The figures released by the Census and Statistics Department (
CSD) Tuesday show that the Hong Kong's re-exports in the first
half of 1999 accounted for 87.2 percent of the value of its total
exports and 42.7 percent of the total value of external trade.
</P>
<P>
The re-exports are slightly higher than the corresponding
shares of 86.2 percent and 41.0 percent in the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the report by the CSD, the Chinese mainland
remained the largest partner for Hong Kong's re-export trade, with
re-exports from the Chinese mainland accounting for 59.9 percent
of the value of re-exports of Hong Kong in the first half of 1999.
As a destination, the Chinese mainland's share was 34.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Most of the re-export trade involving the Chinese mainland is
related to outward processing, as raw materials and semi-
manufactures are exported to the mainland for processing, with the
final products subsequently returned to Hong Kong and then re-
exported to overseas markets, it said.
</P>
<P>
Other main origins of Hong Kong's re-exports include Japan (
accounting for 10.4 percent), Taiwan (6.3 percent), the United
States (5.1 percent) and the Republic of Korea (3.4 percent),
while other main destinations including the United States (
accounting for 22.3 percent), Japan (5.7 percent), Germany (3.6
percent) and the United Kingdom (3.6 percent).

<HEADLINE> DPRK, U.S. Generals Holds Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Generals from the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the United States failed on
Tuesday to reach agreement on starting contacts to demarcate a
maritime boundary on the sea off western Korea.
</P>
<P>
The meeting at the truce village of Panmunjom, the 10th general
officer meeting since the forum was created in June last year, was
proposed by the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
General Ri Chan Bok was the chief negotiator of the DPRK while
Major General Michael Dunn was representing the U.S. side, the
Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the DPRK side insisted that the issue should
be negotiated only between itself and the United States, in
accordance with the truce and international laws.
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang also proposed the detail plans for the working level
talks: closed-door talks on the issue begin at Panmunjom in the
last ten days of August; the delegation of each side composes of
five to seven members and is headed by a senior-colonel officer;
South Korean officers could also be involved; the meetings would
take place every 10 days in principle.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S side repeated its stance that the DPRK should open
talks with South Korea on the issue under the Joint Military
Committee established in 1991. It also insisted the Northern Limit
Line, which was unilaterally set up by the U.S. side at the end of
the Korean War in 1953 and has never been recognized by Pyongyang,
serve as a practical border.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK charged the United States was trying to shirk its
responsibility for easing up the tension on the Korean peninsula
by insisting that the DPRK and South Korea talk directly on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang refused to accept South Korea as a dialogue partner,
dismissing Seoul as a "puppet" regime.
</P>
<P>
General Ri also urged the United States and South Korea to
immediately call off their on-going massive joint military
exercise codenamed "Ul ji Focus Lens", which the DPRK denounced as
"a war gamble targeting the North."
</P>
<P>
The 12-day joint exercise began on Monday.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The UK's underlying rate of
inflation fell by 0.4 percent in July at an annual rate of 2.2
percent, the Office of National Statistics (ONS) announced
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The figure, which excludes mortgage interest payments, was
still below the government's target of 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The headline inflation rate in July, however is 1.3 percent
unchanged from the previous month, despite the City predictions of
a slight fall.
</P>
<P>
So the ONS' figures likely to be seen as a warning that
inflationary pressures in the economy are rising more strongly
than had been thought.
</P>
<P>
As the UK economy is picking up speed, any threat of inflation
spoiling the government's aim of maintaining sustainable growth is
certain to lead to an early interest rate rise.

HARARE, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) Tuesday stressed the need to work out practical modalities
to ensure necessary material and social support for landmine
victims.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting here on assistance to landmine victims in Burundi,
 Mozambique and Uganda, WHO Regional Director for Africa Ebrahim
Samba said this support would enable them to live a meaningful
life.
</P>
<P>
He told delegates that immediate assistance should include the

training of technicians to produce such devices.
</P>
<P>
Other assistance, he said, also involves the training of
technicians to deal with injuries resulting from mine explosions,
clearing mines and the physical and mental rehabilitation of
victims.
</P>
<P>
Africa is one of the most mine-affected areas of the world and
experts estimate that worldwide, one person is killed or injured

<HEADLINE> Roundup: VAT Goes into Full Enforcement in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Value Added Tax (VAT) finally
went into complete enforcement in Nepal on Tuesday, after nearly
two years' confusion over it since the government attempted to
implement it last November.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Mahesh Acharya took a bold step in his annual
budget for the fiscal year 1998/99 to end the unusually protracted
confusion over the tax policy. He unilaterally revoked the
39-point agreement on VAT reached by the previous government with
the business community that compromised with the basics of VAT.
</P>
<P>
With a hope to bring more tax payers under VAT net, Acharya
scaled down the VAT threshold to 2 million rupees (about 29,400
U.S. dollars) from earlier 4.5 million (66,200 U.S. dollars),
requiring virtually every potential businessman to register with
VAT.
</P>
<P>
The threshold level was at the center of the VAT dispute in the
past two years, while a section of business community led by Nepal
Chamber of Commerce opposed VAT. They fear VAT will slice off
significant portion of their profit and will make them
uncompetitive with foreign rivals.
</P>
<P>
The government, however, has no option but VAT. Nepal's total
tax revenue as a share of GDP is one of the lowest in the world.
It hovers around 11 percent as against over 30 percent in the
developed countries and over 20 percent average among the
countries in the South Asian region.
</P>
<P>
Nepal is currently reeling under the pressure of swindling tax
and tariff rates. In the last seven years since Nepal took liberal
economic policy in 1992, all the additional income tax rates have
been waived and highest customs tariffs have been slashed to 40
percent from over 100 percent (except for luxurious goods). The
highest income tax rates have been reduced to 25 percent from 50
percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The pressing imperatives of international trade and regional
trade have made upward revision of tax and tariffs unfeasible.
Under this circumstance, the government hopes to improve revenue
mobilization by expanding tax base under VAT.
</P>
<P>
The business community showed no sign of opposition to the
threshold revision so far. They seem to have found common ground
with the government regarding VAT. But consumers may be
immediately affected by the tax rule.
</P>
<P>
According to some businessmen, VAT will not affect price
theoretically. But practically, prices of commodities will rise.

<HEADLINE> Interview: China's Progress Most Remarkable: Former Nepal FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 17 (Xinhua) -- China has made the most
remarkable achievements in the world over the past 50 years under
the leadership of the Communist Party of China, former Nepali
prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The Progress that China has made in the last five decades is
one of the most remarkable achievements done by any country in
this century," said Deuba, who was Nepali prime minister from
September 1995 to March 1997.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua at his residence, Deuba paid
tribute to the great contributions the Communist Party of China
and the Chinese people have made to China's economic development
and the lift-up of China's international status.
</P>
<P>
"The far-sightedness of the leaders of the Communist Party of
China and the discipline, sacrifice and hard-working of its people
has resulted in tangible development in all sectors and the global
acknowledgment of China as one of the world's biggest markets.
Debilitating poverty seems to have been left behind by most of
China," said Deuba.
</P>
<P>
Deuba visited China in April 1996 at the invitation of the then
Chinese Premier Li Peng, and met with Chinese President Jiang
Zemin as well as other senior Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
Deuba said he was very much impressed by China's economic
progress as well as China's ancient and great civilization during
the visit.
</P>
<P>
"China's progress towards a socialist market economy and its
establishment as an important world leader is very admirable," he
told Xinhua, adding that the impression of a modern China will
always remain with him.
</P>
<P>
During his five-day visit to China, Deuba visited Beijing, the
ancient city of Xi'an and Shengzhen, a boom city in South China.
He saw for himself both the modern and ancient civilization of
China.
</P>
<P>
Deuba said that landmarks of China's ancient civilization such
as the Great Wall and the terra-cotta warriors in Xi'an are the
miracles of the world.
</P>
<P>
He marvelled at the successful integration of the modern
development and the ancient heritage by the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"The ability of the Chinese people to take in the new without
forgetting the old was what I found most remarkable," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Tried, tested and revered values, norms and beliefs have been
assimilated and woven into the fabric of modern China," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Sagacity has been adopted in the process of development and
the resulting stability and sustainable economic growth of China
struck me as being most impressive," Deuba said.
</P>
<P>
As former prime minister and now a member of parliament, Deuba
expressed his appreciation for China's assistance to Nepal in its
economic development and China's support for Nepal, a close and
good neighbor of China's, in preserving its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"Nepal regards China as its most trusted friend," as "China has
helped Nepal not only in its development programs but also
contributed to preserving Nepal's identity and sovereignty," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure the age-old friendly relations between our two
countries will be further strengthened in the coming centuries,"
Deuba said.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the
People's Republic of China (on October 1, 1999) and as the new
century approaching, Deuba conveyed his best wishes to China and
the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"I wish all the leaders and citizens of China the best for the
coming millennium and hope their pride in being citizens of a
peaceful and prosperous China becomes even stronger globally,"
said Deuba.

BANGKOK, August 17 (Xinhua) -- World famous artists will take
part in historic concerts in Thailand later this year to mark the
72nd birthday of King Bhumibol Adulyadej on December 5, the Thai

</P>
<P>
The concerts would be organized at giant outdoor stages at a

</P>
<P>
About 50 groups have offered to sponsor the concerts, with 30
of them promising one million U.S. dollars each, Sansak said.
</P>

OTTAWA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Canada is imposing a ban on blood
donation by those visiting Britain for six months or more between
1980 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Health Canada said Tuesday that the ban, which takes effect on
February 17, 2000, is intended to reduce possibility of

Health Canada decided on the ban following months of

which is also an operator of the national blood service, the

There have been concerns about the spreading of

<HEADLINE> Land Mine Clearing Hampered by Funds Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Land mine clearance is being
hampered by limited financial support from governments and donor
agencies, a local company which specializes in the removal of land
mines said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Marketing Director of the Mine-Tech Company Chris Pearce said
funds for de-mining activities throughout the world were limited
and donor support had been flagging in the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
He was addressing guests attending a demonstration of mine
survey and clearance technique in Harare, the Zimbabwe News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
He said the 1997 historic mine-ban treaty signed by 127
countries in Canada could have led to the decline in donor support
for de-mining activities throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
He said the treaty, known as the Ottawa Convention, had made
some donors and companies believe that the treaty had solved the
land mine problem.
</P>
<P>
Pearce said the land mine problem was there to stay, and the
only solution was to get rid of the land-mines which were already
planted.
</P>
<P>
There were 110 million mines planted throughout the world, of
which a little over one third were in Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations, nearly two million mines were
planted every year while only 200,000 were removed.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that, with the current pace of mine clearance
operations, it would take more than 1,100 years to rid the planet
of already planted mines provided no new mines were laid.
</P>
<P>
Pearce said land mines denied the majority of the people in
developing countries access to land and agriculture, which formed
the basis of their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
He cited an example of Angola which he said was rich in oil and
diamond, but the riches were not benefiting the Angolans as they
could not access them because of mines.
</P>
<P>
Mine-Tech was formed in 1992 and has worked for various clients
 including U.N. agencies, European Union and various
non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
The company has worked in many countries including Angola,
Mozambique, Nicaragua, Somalia, Zimbabwe and Srilanka.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Leaders Reportedly Steal $1 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- As much as one billion U.S.
dollars has disappeared in public funds and international aid
projects through fraud by the Muslim, Croatian and Serbian
nationalist leaders, The New York Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The antifraud unit, set up by the Office of the High
Representative, has exposed so much corruption that relief
agencies and embassies are reluctant to publicize the thefts for
fear of frightening away international donors, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper obtained a report by the unit that names several
officials with ties to the governing nationalist parties, accusing
them of profiting from the fraud.
</P>
<P>
Although 15 officials have been dismissed by the High
Representative or have been blocked from holding office, most
retain authority, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"Organizations as diverse at the Office of the High
Representative, the United Nations and the United States Agency
for International Development, all dedicated to rebuilding the
country, have lost tens of millions of dollars," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report, which has not been made public, cites one incident
in which 10 foreign embassies and international aid agencies lost
more than 20 million U.S. dollars deposited in a Bosnian bank.
</P>
<P>
The unit is investigating 220 cases of alleged fraud and
corruption. The funds were meant to help rebuild Bosnia's roads,
buildings and schools and to provide municipal services in towns
across the country.
</P>
<P>
"Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president along with other
senior nationalist leaders, has dismissed the allegations of
official corruption made by the international investigators," the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The corruption has also played a pivotal role in driving away
foreign investment, seen as the only way to free Bosnia from
dependence on foreign assistance.

<HEADLINE> Quake Death Toll Rises to 1,400 in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The overall death toll in the
strong earthquake in Turkey has climbed to 1,400 and the number of
the injured has risen to more than 6,000, the local media reported
late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Thousands more people are still missing and are feared dead.
</P>
<P>
An oil refinery not far form the epicenter of Izmit has been
caught in a fire and might incur an explosion, a local official
said, adding residents in the surrounding areas have been
evacuated.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said he believes the loss
of lives will be huge, "but, God willing, we will not be faced
with a picture as bad as we fear."
</P>
<P>
However, the indications point to a grim tally.
</P>
<P>
Layer by layer from thousands of sites around western Turkey,
the ruins gave up the dead - many in the pajamas and nightgowns
they wore when the immense temblor struck with 45 seconds of
terror and destruction in the cool hours before dawn.
</P>
<P>
As many as 10, 000 people could still be trapped in rubble
around Golcuk, a navy base town about 130 kilometers southeast of
Istanbul and near the quake's epicenter.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake was the worst ever to strike western Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers dug with everything from bare hands to picks and
shovels.
</P>
<P>
The United States, France, Israel and Egypt, among other
countries, have dispatched relief material and personnel to Turkey
to help the country to pass the difficult time.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Branded Most Risky Place For Journalists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANA quoted one of the organization's statement published
Monday as saying that 10 journalists got killed in their work in
Sierra Leone during the first eight months this year against the
background of wide-spread atrocities against civilians.
</P>
<P>
The RSF said 20 journalists were killed worldwide in the same
period, a figure larger than that of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia came second with six journalists killed, Nigeria has
two, Colombia and Lebanon one, respectively, according to the
organization's statement.
</P>
<P>
''The murder of journalists is often a good indicator of the
suffering endured by the rest of the population,'' the RSF said,
adding that in January alone, eight journalists were murdered by
the Revolutionary United Front, former rebels of Sierra Leone
before the July 7 Lome peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The organization said two journalists covering clashes between
rival ethnic groups were also murdered in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
''RSF is particularly concerned because most of the crimes
committed against journalists are likely to remain unpunished, the
reluctance of many governments to track down and punish those who
killed journalists can only encourage the continuation of these
crimes,'' it said in its Monday statement.
</P>
<P>
The RSF noted that even after the recent 50th anniversary
celebrations of the Geneva Conventions, some states are incapable
of protecting civilians, particularly journalists, in war time.
</P>
<P>
The organization urged all states signatory to the Geneva
Conventions to respect their commitments by protecting
journalists' basic right to life as well as giving courts and
committees of inquiry the necessary resources to find and punish
those who murder journalists
</P>
<P>
The organization observed that in Europe the conflict between
Serbia and NATO countries hit the media hard with three Chinese
journalists killed when their embassy was bombed in Belgrade by
NATO aircraft.

<HEADLINE> Immigration Target Unchanged, Canadian Minister Reaffirms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Immigration Minister
Elinor Caplan Tuesday reaffirmed the country won't change its
current target of a yearly 225,000 immigrants, according to a CTV
report.
</P>
<P>
She was denying reports that the federal government is
considering a move to more than double that target to 500,000.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the on-going three-day Liberal caucus retreat in
Halifax, Nova Scotia, the minister told reporters, "At the present
time, the policy is that the targets for immigration for Canada
are between 200,000 and 225,000 people."
</P>
<P>
"There is no discussion at this time about changing that as far
as I'm aware," the minister said. "What we're attempting to do is
to see what we can do to achieve those targets."
</P>
<P>
Local reports said earlier that the country failed to meet its
immigration target in the past two years and some members of the
caucus wanted that target increased to 500,000.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Liberal Party caucus meeting, which opened Monday,
is on hot debate on ways to spend the anticipated 10 billion
Canadian dollars (67.34 billion U.S. dollars) in budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
The battle lines are drawn between tax-cut Liberal MPs and
those advocating a fall agenda aimed at new social programs for
kids, local media reports said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Opposes India's Nuclear Doctrine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Tuesday
opposed India's move to create a credible nuclear deterrence and
said it will continue efforts to encourage India abandon their
nuclear programs.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin described the move "in
the wrong direction" as it would create an "action-reaction cycle
that will increase the risks" to both India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
India's National Security Advisory Board on Monday released a
draft doctrine which stated that India will pursue a policy of
credible nuclear deterrence. The draft also said India will use
nuclear weapons only to retaliate against a first strike.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the United States would "encourage India to take
additional steps to demonstrate its declared intention to avoid a
nuclear missile race with its Neighbors."
</P>
<P>
He was referring to India's earlier indication that it could
accept the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty next month.
</P>
<P>
He said Washington had noted India's Prime Minister Atal
Vajpayee stated this week that he wanted to build a consensus on
the CTBT to allow the new government, once it is formed after
elections this fall, to approve India's joining the treaty.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Launches National Census </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
Tuesday assured that this year's national population and housing
census would be the best, most accurate and successful in the
country's history.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks when he officially launched the
1999 population and housing census at the Kenyatta International
Conference Centre grounds in the capital Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
"This will definitely be the most successful census we have ever
 experienced since its inception in 1948,'' Moi said.
</P>
<P>
The President urged all Kenyans to support the process, asking
communities to disregard the belief that counting people,
particularly children, was a bad omen.
</P>
<P>
The President also assured enumerators that security had been
put in place nationally and asked them to proceed with confidence.
</P>
<P>
Moi noted the census was important because it would help the
government in planning and in the execution of social and economic
needs of the people,
</P>
<P>
and also would help to measure and assess key changes that have
taken place since independence, following marked population
growth.
</P>
<P>
The data to be collected will include the fertility rate
decline, the impact of the HIV/AIDS pandemic and the extent of
urbanization. It would also help in forming effective housing
policies and social amenities.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the census, the fourth since independence and
the last this century, was the most important planning tool for
the country because it would form a strong basis for allocating
resources, document the progress made by authorities and help form
effective town development plans.
</P>
<P>
Kenyans, he said, were looking forward to a professional and
accurate census, and the government was committed to living up to
these expectations,
</P>
<P>
by ensuring among other things that the results were announced
on time.
</P>
<P>
This year's census will begin on the night of August 24 and
will continue up to August 31. It is expected that preliminary
results will be ready within six months of the census exercise.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 census will be Kenya's sixth census since 1948,
enumerated the following number of people: five million in 1948,
nine million in 1962, 11 million in 1969, 15 million in 1979 and
21 million in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The country's present population is estimated at 30 million.

<HEADLINE> Humanitarian Agency Appeals for 7 Million Dollars to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The International Federation of
Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, has appealed for 10.5
million Swiss francs (about 7 million U.S. dollars) to help an
estimated 100,000 people affected by a severe earthquake in
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Geneva-based humanitarian agency said here Tuesday that it
was seeking the money in cash.
</P>
<P>
"The first priority is cash simply to enable the Turkish Red
Crescent to buy relief supplies which can be purchased locally.
There is no need for huge international relief flights...,"
spokesman Helge Kvam said.
</P>
<P>
"The aim is to aid an estimated 100,000 beneficiaries, people
who have been affected in some way, losing their homes or
belongings," he said. "We do not have all the information to say
exactly how many people are victims, but we need an estimate to
have funds as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
He said tents, blankets, food and water purification tablets
would be the top priority.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Red Crescent, which sent four rescue and relief
teams to the zone, set up a field hospital in Yalova, south of
Izmit, according to the federation.

LONDON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- London's benchmark FTSE 100
closed down 69 points at 6,166.4 Tuesday, led by resources stocks,
as metals group Billiton extended its decline from record highs.
</P>
<P>
The major casualty in the session, Billiton had risen strongly
in recent session on hopes of consolidation in the aluminum
sector. It fell to earth Tuesday, sliding almost 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Billiton fell for the second day, after Deutsche Bank advised
investors to sell the stock and switch to Rio Tinto.
</P>
<P>
FTSE 100 decliners also included EMAP, down 33p at 1,028p, on
concern about the outlook for circulation figures and after
Deutsche Bank has cut its profit.
</P>
<P>
Shares in the FTSE 100 index which rose included SmithKline
Beecham, up 4.5p at 774p, after the company said it completed the
sale of its clinical laboratory unit.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Dax index closed up 2.81 points, or 0.05 percent, at
5,259.91, off highs as the Dow's early rally stalled.
</P>
<P>
Stocks in Paris closed up for the fifth consecutive session on
the day, after U.S. consumer prices data which was in line with
forecasts provided some cheer for players frustrated by a dearth
of corporate news.
</P>

The blue-chip CAC 40 index notched up a closing gain of 0.47
percent at 4,479.75, although traders said any further advance
would be capped ahead of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy

<HEADLINE> China to Break Traditional Education with Kart Racing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chasing after this dream, Li has been driving a kart for over
two hours every day for the past two years, despite the fact that
there is only one Chinese F1 driver among the world's top 50.
</P>
<P>
The first national kart racing for teenagers was held today in
the city of Liyang in east China's Jiangsu Province. More than 80
pupils from Beijing, Tianjin, and Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces
are taking part in the three-day competition.
</P>
<P>
"Kart driving is the cradle for F-1 racers," said Jin Xuefang,
section chief for basic education in the Ministry of Education, "
The purpose of popularizing kart driving among primary and middle
school students, however, is to offer a vehicle for quality-
oriented education which is being promoted nationwide."
</P>
<P>
The Ministry and the China Association for Science and
Technology (CAST) jointly launched a program in 1994 to enhance
the capabilities of Chinese students in mastering modern
techniques.
</P>
<P>
Karts were seen as an experiment for practicing modern-
technique education by introducing kart driving to students. In
the past, Chinese students were often asked to make jiao zi (
dumplings) or bind mops when taking technique-training courses.
</P>
<P>
Kart driving now has been introduced to some 30 primary and
middle schools in Beijing, and currently the kart is the only
motor vehicle that kids under the age of 18 can drive in China.
</P>
<P>
Jin said that quality-oriented education should be ideational
and vivid, with technique education an essential part of it. "
Technique education is an important way to improving students'
comprehensive capabilities," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Kart driving helps encourage students to put on their thinking
caps and do things with their own hands," Jin said, "This will
enable students to become familiar with scientific know-how, and
improve their coordination."
</P>
<P>
Lu Taichang, a CAST official, noted that China will not only be
repaid with F-1 racers of its own, but also with many multi-
talented people in the future, if more courses involving science
and technology are available, such as kart driving, which has now
been introduced to 930,000 primary and middle schools across China.

SHANTOU, August 18 (Xinhua) -- A photograph exhibit with the
theme "Safeguarding Sovereignty" was staged here in south China's
Guangdong Province in memory of the three Chinese journalists who
died in the U.S.-led NATO attack on the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade in May.
</P>
<P>
The exhibit, jointly sponsored by the Xinhua News Agency and

Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The show displaying details of the cruelty of the bombing and
the bravery of the Chinese journalists devoted to the fight for
peace and justice welcomed 300 visitors at its debut here today.
</P>
<P>
"Safeguarding China's sovereignty" has a special meaning these
days, when separatists led by Lee Teng-hui are trying to split
Taiwan from the motherland. We will not allow Taiwan to become
another Kosovo," said one visitor to the exhibit.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Announces Rehabilitation Scheme for Slum Dwellers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina on Wednesday announced a series of measures for the
rehabilitation of the country's slum dwellers.
</P>
<P>
Each slum-dweller family intending to return to their ancestral
homestead in villages would be provided with travel expense, three
months' free food support and micro-credit facilities for income
generation through government institutions and agencies, the prime
minister told the first meeting of the recently-established "Slum
Dwellers Rehabilitation Committee."
</P>
<P>
Giving guidelines for proper rehabilitation of the slum
dwellers, she said the prime objective of her government was to
provide shelters to every homeless people of the country.
</P>
<P>
Because of river erosion or social deprivation, the slum people
were compelled to leave their homes and migrated to urban areas,
she said, adding that the root cause of the unending migration of
rural people to urban areas was poverty and joblessness.
</P>
<P>
These people had been living in un-hygienic condition and
leading a sub-human life in the slums of the city and were also
subjected to various types of exploitation, she said, adding the
slums became centers of crime and anti-social activities.
</P>
<P>
The measures included a survey in the slums to identity those
who had homesteads in their villages and were willing to go back
and those distressed poor people who had no way to go back to
their villages.
</P>
<P>
Estimates show that there are around 2 million slum dwellers in
Dhaka, which has a population of about 9 million.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Not Intended to Make Trouble for Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Egypt said Wednesday that its
refusal to allow an Israeli passenger plane to pass through its
airspace Tuesday was a misunderstanding of operating procedures
and Egypt had no intention to make trouble for Israeli flights.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy summoned Egypt's ambassador
to Israel Mohamed Bassiouny to explain why air-controllers in
Egypt did not allow a Boeing 747 passenger plane of Israel's
national carrier El Al to enter Egyptian airspace on its route to
Bangkok, Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The plane had to return to Tel Aviv with 329 passengers on
board. The incident is the third of its kind in 10 day. Two
Israeli charter planes to Kenya were also denied entrance to
Egyptian airspace, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
"Ambassador Bassiouny reiterated that Egypt has no diplomatic
or political intention to make difficulties for El Al flights in
Egyptian airspace and that the incidents were the result of a
misunderstanding of the standard operating procedures between the
aviation authorities," Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a
statement after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The Ambassador stated that the matter would be taken care
of," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Local media quoted Egyptian civil aviation officials as saying
that Israel had failed on several occasions to request permission
to use Egyptian airspace.
</P>
<P>
Since Israel signed a peace treaty with Egypt in 1979, all
flights from Tel Aviv to Bangkok, Bombay, South Africa and Kenya
have passed over the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt.

SOFIA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria will dispatch a team of
39 fire fighters to join the efforts to put down the quake-caused

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Receive 20m Dollar Grant from Denmark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will receive a
140-million Danish kroner (about 20.2 million U.S. dollars) grant
from Denmark for rural development activities in two coastal
districts, the national news agency BSS reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement in this regard, signed here Wednesday, is for the
implementation of the phase-2 of the rural development project,
under which infrastructure development in the southern coastal
districts of Barguna and Patuakhali began in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Denmark gave 710 million taka (about 14.3 million
dollars) for the phase-1 of the project, thus raising the total
grant for the project to 1.71 billion taka (about 34.5 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The objective of the project is to support the economic and
social development of the region by rehabilitation of markets and
roads in the area.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase of the project, roads and markets have been
improved in eight of the 11 sub-districts of the two districts,
and the phase-2 will cover the remaining three sub-districts.

<HEADLINE> World Bank, WMO Cooperate in Reducing Impacts of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank and the World
Meteorological Organization (WMO) have signed a memorandum of
understanding, agreeing on closer cooperation in areas of common
interest, particularly natural disaster prevention and mitigation,
climate change, and phenomena such as El Nino, the bank announced
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum of understanding, signed by World Bank Vice
President for Environmentally and Socially Sustainable Development
Ian Johnson and WMO Secretary-General G.O.P. Obasi, is designed to
improve strategic collaboration between the two institutions, the
bank said. At the core of this strengthened cooperation is the
establishment of a WMO-World Bank liaison in Washington.
</P>
<P>
One element of more effective disaster management is the better
use of climate information and forecasting. With the technical
expertise of the WMO and the global touch of the World Bank, this
information can be more effectively and expansively disseminated,
the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries are likely to be severely affected by
climate change and water constraints, so they will need help in
developing the financial, technical, and human capacity to adapt
to a changing climate and increasing water scarcity. A pragmatic
strategy on vulnerability and adaptation concerns will be
developed and implemented by the two institutions, according to
the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Over the last ten years, the World Bank has provided almost 9
billion U.S. dollars in emergency loans to help countries recover
from the impacts of natural disasters.

<HEADLINE> Ottey's Statement on Withdrawal from Athletics Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Following is the text of the
statement issued by sprinter Merlene Ottey's management on her
withdrawal from the World Track and Field Championships in Seville,
Spain, following reports she tested positive for the banned
substance Nandrolone at the EAA Meeting in Lucerne, Switzerland in
July:
</P>
<P>
On August 15, 1999, the management agency of Merlene Ottey was
contacted via phone by a representative of the IAAF that
supposedly a positive A-test sample was found in a drug test taken
from Merlene Ottey at the EAA-Meeting in Lucerne on July 5, 1999
with the alleged substance Nandrolone.
</P>
<P>
However, to this date, the athlete has not received any
detailed or specific information about the actual results of the
test. Based on these circumstances Merlene Ottey has decided to
withdraw from the upcoming IAAF World Championships in Seville.
</P>
<P>
Merlene Ottey: "To write this statement has been the most
difficult and emotionally draining experience of my life. I have
lived my personal and athletic life with the utmost honesty and
integrity. I have applied only the highest ethical standards to
myself and expect the same from others. I have always proclaimed
fairness in sports and adamantly oppose the use of banned
substances. I owe it to my family, my country, my beloved sport
and all my fans around the world to prove that this is a terrible
mistake and that I will do everything in my power to find the
truth and prove my innocence."
</P>
<P>
Since 1979 Merlene Ottey has been tested approximately 100
times during her international career. All results were negative.
The most recent tests in Ljubjliana on May 12, 1999 and in
Stockholm on July 30, 1999 have also shown negative results.
Merlene Ottey competed every week at international competitions
since May 29, 1999 until July 5, 1999 and was easily accessible
for testing.
</P>
<P>
Merlene Ottey is planning to undergo a voluntary drug test
under the supervision of the Jamaican Athletic Federation as soon
as possible and intends to communicate such results to the public.
</P>
<P>
She will be available for further comments when the exact A-
sample test results from the meeting in Lucerne on July 5, 1999
are received.

<P>
It said that the plane "was on a mission to lay mines in the
mountain passes of Chechnya to prevent terrorists from
infiltrating into Dagestan."

incident," and promised to take necessary measures to "prevent
similar incidents in the future."

<HEADLINE> One Killed, Scores Injured in Violence in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- One young man was killed and
scores were injured in Bangladesh on Wednesday in violence during
the opposition-organized siege of the offices of deputy
commissioners (DC) across the country, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The siege of DC offices was part of the opposition's
anti-government campaign on several issues including the
government's recent decision to examine a proposal of extending
road transshipment facilities to India.
</P>
<P>
A lathe machine worker was killed and more than 40 people were
injured when unidentified gunmen attacked a procession led by the
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) marching towards the DC office
in Narayanganj, 16 kilometers southeast of the capital, police
said.
</P>
<P>
A large area of the old part of the capital came to a
standstill with shops shattered and roads blocked as BNP activists
clashed with police for nearly three hours when their march was
stopped near the DC office.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 people, including four policemen, were injured
during the clash, and 13 activists were arrested following the
incident, police said.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Dhaka district administration said the
opposition parties including BNP submitted a memorandum to the
deputy commissioner's office as part of their program.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance, comprising the major opposition -- the
BNP, the Jatiya Party, the Jamaat-e-Islami and the Islami Oikya
Jote, earlier this month announced fresh anti-government programs,
including the siege of district DC offices across the country and
a siege of the Bangladesh Secretariat next month.
</P>
<P>
The programs were aimed at "forcing reversal of the government
plans to give transshipment facilities to India," Deputy Leader of
the Opposition in Parliament Badruddoza Chowdhury said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition accused the government of allowing "corridor to
India in the name of transshipment."

highly values the efforts Mahathir has made over the years to
promote the friendship and relations of cooperation between the
two countries.

<P>
"The two sides have carried out a series of cooperation with
substantial contents and tangible results," Zhu said.

missions: one is to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic ties between Malaysia and China and
the other is to further promote the development of the bilateral
relationship.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia will continue to adhere to the "one China"
policy. Also, he expressed the appreciation for China's agreement
in principle to sign a protocol pact on the nuclear-weapon-free-
zone status of southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
He once again expressed his appreciation for China's
responsible attitude during the Asia financial crisis and its
adherence to not devaluing the Chinese currency.
</P>
<P>
The two heads of government are satisfied with the growth of
trade and economic cooperation and exchanged views on furthering
such cooperation during the talks.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Denies Disruption of Israeli Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Abdel Fattah Kato, the head of
Egypt's Civil Aviation Authority, on Wednesday denied that it was
disrupting flights of Israeli planes in its airspace.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that a plane of El Al, Israel's national
carrier, flying to Johannesburg, South Africa, Tuesday night was
allowed to fly over Egypt although it did not obtain a permit in
advance.
</P>
<P>
"Clarifications have been sent more than once to the Israeli
authorities on the necessity of having a permit in advance for
their planes," Kato said.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Israeli aviation agreement requires a permit in
advance to fly in each other's airspace, Kato said. He blamed
Israel for failing to observe the rules.
</P>
<P>
Israel has reportedly expressed concern over alleged flight
disruptions that its passenger planes have encountered over
Egyptian airspace.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Ministry Deputy Spokesman Akiva Tor said on
Wednesday that an El Al plane to Bangkok, Thailand, was turned
back by Egyptian air controllers Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
In the last 10 days, two Israeli charter flights to Kenya also
encountered problems while flying over Egypt, Tor said. One was
turned back and the other was delayed.
</P>
<P>
Tor said Israeli planes flying to Africa and the Far East have
no other option but to fly over Egypt, one of the only two Arab
countries in the region with which it has a peace treaty.

<HEADLINE> Three Former Rwandan Ministers Plead Not Guilty at </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The three appeared before Trial Chamber II of the United
Nations tribunal. Two pleaded not guilty to charges of genocide
and crimes against humanity and one had his plea of not guilty
entered on his behalf by the Trial Chamber after he failed to
plead, according to a statement released by the court.
</P>
<P>
The two who pleaded "not guilty" are Justin Mugenzi, 50, former
Minister of Trade and Industry, and Prosper Mugiraneza, 42, former
Minister of the Civil Service, and the Trial Chamber entered a
plea of not guilty on behalf of Jerome Bicamumpaka, 42, former
Minister of Foreign Affairs, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
A fourth, Casimir Bizimungu, 48, former Minister of Health, who
is jointly charged with the three, could not enter his plea
because his assigned lawyer Judith Bourne from the United States,
has not arrived in north Tanzania's Arusha town, where the ICTR is
based.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution alleged that the accused jointly participated
in the planning, preparation or execution of a common plan, to
commit the atrocities against Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda
in 1994. At least 500,000 people in the country were killed in
the genocide.
</P>
<P>
"The crimes were committed by them personally, by persons they
assisted or by their subordinates, and with their knowledge or
consent," the prosecution told the Trial Chamber.
</P>
<P>
The crimes they were charged are alleged to have resulted in
massacres against Tutsis and moderate Hutus at a hospital in
Butare, southern Rwanda, where among those murdered was the former
Queen of Rwanda, Rosalie Gicanda, a historical symbol of all
Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
Also cited were massacres that took place at Butare University
Hospital and at the Secondary Nursing School in Kabgayi, Gitarama
Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Mugenzi is alleged to have made statements inciting people to
kill Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
Bicamumpaka and Mugiraneza are alleged to have taken no

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Cooperation Between China and UPU (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The following is a brief account
of relations of cooperation between China and the Universal Postal
Union (UPU), a special institute under the United Nations:
</P>
<P>
China was in a semi-colonial, semi-feudal state when UPU was
founded in 1874. China then had no access to UPU because its
postal services were controlled by major western powers.
</P>
<P>
In 1897, China attended the UPU congress for the first time as
an observer. It sent a delegation headed by imperial envoy Wu
Tingfang to the Fifth Congress of UPU in Washington.
</P>
<P>
China officially join UPU on March 1, 1914, four decades after
the international organization was founded.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of new China in 1949, China sent
representatives to attend a meeting of the former Executive and
Liaison Council (the predecessor of the present Council of
Administration) in May, 1950, and a joint meeting of UPU and the
International Air Transport Association in January, 1951.
</P>
<P>
China also notified UPU in December, 1950 that it accepted the
Universal Postal Convention and other conventions that UPU passed
at its congress in Paris in 1947.
</P>
<P>
However, China was deprived of its legal membership in UPU in
April, 1951. As a result, China suspended its relations with UPU
for the next 21 years.
</P>
<P>
After China's legal representation was restored in the UN and
all its agencies by an overwhelming majority of votes at the 26th
UN General Assebly, UPU passed a resolution to recognize People's
Republic of China as the sole legal representative of China in UPU
on April 13, 1972.

<P>
As China deepened its understanding of UPU, it began to take an
active part in resolving problems in the field of postal
operations. For example, it led a panel to resolve the issue of
terminal dues. It reflects that China has already has the ability
to contribute to resolving problems in international post aervice.
It also shows that China has won trust among both developed and
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
In November, 1972, China attended the annual meeting of the
Postal Study and Consultation Council of UPU in Bern.
</P>
<P>
Since then, China went through necessary procedures to approve
relevant conventions of UPU. It attended the UPU congresses from
1974 to 1994. It was elected as a vice-chairman of the UPU
congresses for four times and a member of the Postal Operation
Council at every congress. It was also elected as a member of the
Council of Administration at all but one of the UPU congresses. It
was also elected as vice-chairman of the Council of Administration
twice.
</P>
<P>
By the time when the 21st UPU Congress was held in Seoul in
1994, China had adopted all the existing conventions of UPU.
</P>
<P>
In January, 1994, China sent a letter to the International
Bureau of UPU to apply for hosting the 22nd UPU Congress in
Beijing. China's application was later approved at the 21st UPU
Congress in Seoul, which decided that the next congress will be
held in Beijing from August 23 to September 15, 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to the convention of UPU congress, China will be the
chairman of the coming UPU congress and the chairman of the
Council of Administration till the next UPU congress.
</P>
<P>
China has placed great importance on hosting the UPU congress.
Chinese President Jiang Zemin is the honorary chairman of the
Chinese Organizing Committee. Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo is
the chairman of the organizing committee. The organizing committee
consists officials from more than 20 ministries and government
departments.
</P>
<P>
China has made careful preparations for the UPU congress,
including construction of a new convention building. At present,
Beijing is ready to receive the more than 2,200 people from over
170 countries and over 30 international organizations to the UPU
congress.

<HEADLINE> China Enhances Trademark Protection for Overseas Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- China is taking measures to
combat trademark violations involving overseas companies in a bid
to protect their rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the number of trademark infringement cases
has increased considerably, seriously harming the interests of
overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released today by the State
Administration For Industry and Commerce, related departments in
China handled 713 trademark violation cases in the first half of
this year, a hefty annual increase of 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Among them, 690 cases involved trademark abuses of overseas
companies, and the number of such cases was up more than 30
percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
An official with the administration said that China will
further enhance efforts in fighting against violations of the
Trademark Law in the areas of production, circulation, printing,
and applications to protect the rights of overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
He said that China recently mapped out a priority list
protecting 280 famous domestic and overseas trademarks.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, industrial and commercial
administrations nationwide enhanced supervision of the production
and trading of fake products and the infringement of trademarks in
the commercial sector, and fined and punished a number of
violators.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities in the city of Shenzhen in south China's
Guangdong Province levied a heavy fine against the violator of
Japan's YKK company trademark, and in Xiamen, in southeast China,
those responsible were fined 40 percent of their annual revenue
for printing a famous Thailand beverage's trademark without
permission.

<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- A three-day national conference
attended by chiefs of provincial-level Taiwan affairs offices from
across the country concluded here today.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Qian Qichen addressed the meeting, and
participants studied and discussed instructions from the central
leadership on the current campaign against the "two-state" remarks
made by Taiwan leader Lee Teng-hui in his July 9 speech.
</P>
<P>
The anti-separatist drive has won nationwide and worldwide
support, and has strongly shocked the island province. The
participants agreed that the struggle against Lee's "two-state"
remarks is of great importance for the sovereignty, territorial
integrity, and peaceful reunification of the country.
</P>
<P>
They held that Lee's "two-state" remarks are against the will
of the Chinese people, have met a cold shoulder internationally,
and are doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
While stressing the importance of adhering to the basic
principle of "peaceful reunification, one country with two systems,
" they said that China can never commit itself to giving up the
use of force in reunifying the country.
</P>
<P>
The participants pledged to continue to promote personnel,
economic and cultural exchanges between the two sides across the
Taiwan Straits, and continue to encourage Taiwan businessmen to
invest in the mainland.

<HEADLINE> Pyongyang Raps U.S. for Stirring Up Arms Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) charged on Wednesday that the United
States stirred up an arms race in recent years through arms export,
posing a serious threat to peace and stability in the world.
</P>
<P>
The United States should first retrieve its military machinery
around the world before pointing its fingers at the DPRK's
satellite and missile program, said a DPRK Foreign Affairs
Ministry spokesman in an interview with the Korean Central News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman quoted a New York Times report as saying that the
United States was the biggest arms exporter last year with the
official arms sales amounting to 7.8 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He condemned the United States for using countries such as Iraq
and Yugoslavia as arms testing grounds to improve its mass
destruction weapons.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the United States recently raised a hue
and cry about the "threats" of DPRK's satellite and missile
program in order to find an excuse for attempting to repeat on the
Korean peninsula what it has done in Iraq and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the U.S. military threats could only
compel the DPRK to adopt such means as satellite and missile
launching to safeguard its sovereignty, peace and stability, and
try every possible way to enhance its national strength and
military power.

<HEADLINE> Prime Suspect in Ship Killings Detained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The prime suspect in last year
's murder of 23 Chinese citizens aboard a Hong Kong-registered
ocean-going ship was detained by police on Sunday night in Huilai
County in south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Information from the Guangdong Provincial Public Security
Bureau said that the prime suspect, Weng Siliang, along with Zhu
Youwang, another major suspect, collaborated with an international
pirate group led by an Indonesian in the ransacking of the cargo
ship.
</P>
<P>
The "Cheung Son" cargo ship, owned by Hong Kong Waibert
Steamship Co. Ltd, set sail from Shanghai on November 12, 1998,
bound for Malaysia. Twenty-three Chinese citizens were hired to
work as crew members aboard the ship.
</P>
<P>
The ship was stopped on the South China Sea on November 16 by a
group of people, including Weng, who were in shabby sheet metal
boats. The pirates killed all the Chinese crewmen aboard, and
took over the ship.
</P>
<P>
The dead bodies of the 23 missing crew members were later found
on the coast near Shanwei, Lufeng, and Huilai, all in Guangdong
Province.
</P>
<P>
Chinese public security officers scoured 12 provinces and
municipalities and detained 54 other suspects, but Weng Siliang, a
resident of Shanwei, remained at large for a long time.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Weng's capture, Zhu Youliang was caught by police on
August 8. The killing of the 23 Chinese crewmen was the worst
crime on the high seas of China since the founding of the People's
Republic of China in October of 1949.

<HEADLINE> Uzbekistan Denies Bombing Targeted at Tajikistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Uzbek Air Force's bombing
on the militants based in Kyrgyzstan Sunday was not aimed in any
way at targets in Tajikistan, said Uzbek Foreign Minister
Abdulaziz Kamilov Tuesday in the Uzbek capital of Tashkent.
</P>
<P>
However, the possibility cannot be ruled out that the aircraft
flew into Tajikistan because the militants were in the border area
between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, said Kamilov, according to
report monitored in Alma Ata.
</P>
<P>
The operation was conducted upon the request by Kyrgyzstan to
eliminate rebel forces, said Kamilov.
</P>
<P>
Uzbek Security Council secretary Morakbar Rakhmonkulov said
that the militants planned to continue into Uzbekistan to stage
diversions there.
</P>
<P>
Kyrgyzstan's national security chief Esen Topoyev has confirmed
that Uzbek warplanes hit targets in the southern mountainous area
some 15 kilometers from the Tajik border where the gunmen were
believed to be located, according to a separate report.
</P>
<P>
Tajik Foreign Minister Talbak Nazarov summoned on Monday Uzbek
Ambassador to Tajikistan, Bakhtiyar Urdashev, to protest the
bombing of its northern territory by Uzbek planes early Sunday
morning, and demanded steps be taken to prevent such events from
happening again.
</P>
<P>
The bombing caused no casualties but killed more than 100
cattle and ruined a lot of buildings and farmlands, according to
the Tajik Foreign Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Canadians May Be Exposed to DU Hazard in Kosovo, MP Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Canadian troops in Kosovo may be
exposed to hazard caused by NATO's depleted uranium bombs, the
Globe and Mail newspaper Wednesday quoted a Reform MP as warning.
</P>
<P>
"We know how badly they have botched the handling of soldiers
exposed to bauxite and PCBs in Croatia and my concern is that we
are seeing a repeat of that experience," Reform MP Art Hanger said
Tuesday referring to the depleted uranium hazard.
</P>
<P>
The defense critic called on the Department of National Defense
to launch a thorough investigation to determine how much depleted
uranium is in the vicinity of Canadian troops in Kosovo, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The safety warning came after the release this week of about 1,
000 pages of Defense Department documents dealing with depleted
uranium, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"The hazards after firing are directly related to ingestion, or
ingress of particle through wounds," the documents said, adding "
an uneducated public, in close contact with areas subject to
concentrated attacks from DU would be at some health hazard."
</P>
<P>
The same documents, however, dismiss concerns about the
potentially damaging health effects of exposure to the DU
ammunition, saying: "DU is nothing more than metal byproduct of
the uranium refining process, "with only" slight levels of
radioactivity equal to that from a luminous wrist-watch dial for
each projectile."
</P>
<P>
During NATO's bombardment of Yugoslavia the alliance's fighter
jets had dropped scores of bombs containing depleted uranium in
order to force the Yugoslav army out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Globe and Mail newspaper said Canada will have about 1,300
peacekeepers serving in Kosovo and Macedonia by the end of this
month.
</P>
<P>
The UN Environment Program last week said it would conduct an
investigation to determine if there was health damage caused by DU
shells in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> S.African Countries Take Measures to Curb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe and other southern
African countries will introduce an international vehicle
clearance certificate to combat increased vehicle trafficking
across the borders, a police spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Wayne Bvudzijena, officer of the Police Press and Public
Relations, said the certificate was expected to be in place by
January next year and would be obtainable from the police.
</P>
<P>
He said this decision was made by ministers responsible for
police operations at the Southern African Regional Police Chiefs
Cooperation Organization (SARPCCO) meeting held in Swaziland last
month.
</P>
<P>
"The ministers noted with concern the unacceptable high level
of organized transnational and violent crimes within the region
and appreciated the efforts to combat crime," he said.
</P>
<P>
Countries which were represented at the meeting include Angola,
Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa,
Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The officer said the purpose of the certificate would be to
serve as proof that a vehicle was not reported stolen in a SARPCCO
country where it would be registered before being taken to another
country.
</P>
<P>
The clearance certificate would have unique security features
which would include a watermark that could only be read under
ultra violet light, he said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that in 1997, during a police operation
involving Mozambique, Zambia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, 1,576
stolen vehicles were recovered.

<HEADLINE> Internet Improves Education in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Li Haifeng, motivated by the
trend toward open education and the idea of sharing educational
resources, decided to establish a school network for Beijing No.
101 Middle School, which was founded by the Communist Party of
China (CPC) in the caves of Yan'an, a base area of the Chinese
revolution.
</P>
<P>
No.101 School, one of Beijing's key middle schools, became the
first middle school in China to be linked to the Internet in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"People can easily find what we were teaching last week on the
'net," said Li, the school's headmaster, adding that "hundreds of
thousands of people have benefited from the Internet." No.101
School has set up more than 30 sub-centers in over two-thirds of
China's administrative regions.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Education said that the
creation of the school network is an important technological base
for providing a modern education.
</P>
<P>
"The adoption of school networking will help improve the
quality of education and be conducive to popularizing the
education designed to improve students' quality in China," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
China is now trying to link its primary and middle schools to
the Internet in a bid to enlarge the world for students and help
them become more creative.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education is now preparing to set up a special
databank within the school network, CERNET (China Education and
Research Network), and has already begun to collect excellent
design plans nationwide for the project. Designs which pass the
appraisal of experts will be recommended to schools across the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education adopted the use of censorship in
recommending educational software to be used by primary and middle
schools, and only software passing the Ministry's examination will
be included on the list of recommended teaching and learning
materials for the schools.
</P>
<P>
According to incomplete statistics, school networks have been
established or are under construction in over 500 of China's 930,
000 primary and middle schools, with many more planning to do so.
School investment in the network ranged from hundreds of thousands
of yuan to over one million yuan (about 120,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The problems in the construction of school networks include an
over-emphasis on hardware rather than on appropriate software, and
some of the equipment has been used less than anticipated.

<HEADLINE> Seven Jailed for Evading, Resisting Court Orders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme People's Court (SPC)
said here today that seven people have been given jail terms
ranging from one year to 13 years for intentional evasion of or
violent resistance to the enforcement of court rulings.
</P>
<P>
These sentences are part of the country's week-long media
campaign against local interference with and resistance to the
enforcement of court rulings, which aims to eliminate
difficulties rooted in local protectionism.
</P>
<P>
"Those who dare to interfere in or resist the enforcement of
court rulings should be punished according to law, otherwise the
unity and dignity of the country's laws cannot be ensured," said
Li Guoguang, vice-president of the Supreme People's Court.
</P>
<P>
Chen Guoan, a jobless man in southwest China's Yunnan Province,
threw a grenade at law enforcers while they were performing their
duties. Fortunately, the law officers jumped aside immediately and
narrowly escaped death.
</P>
<P>
Chen was sentenced 13 years for attempted homicide and
resistance to law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of June, more than 850,000
court rulings involving 259 billion yuan (about 31.2 billion U.S.
dollars) had yet to be executed.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme People's Court has vowed to reform the current law
enforcement system, and plans to unify and coordinate law
enforcement units in order to eliminate problems related to the
enforcement of court rulings.

<HEADLINE> Top Religious Official Analyzes Falun Gong Cult </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- China's top official in charge
of religious affairs said on a popular TV talk show today that the
Falun Gong created by Li Hongzhi has all the features of a cult.
</P>
<P>
"A cult is characterized by cheating, madness, fallacy,
secretive organizations and activities, and anti-government and
anti-social motivations," Ye Xiaowen, director of State
Administration of Religious Affairs, told CCTV.
</P>
<P>
"And Falun Gong possess all these features," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that Li Hongzhi is more sophisticated than
most cult leaders because they designate a certain day as doomsday,
and when that doesn't happen, their preaching is self-destroyed.
</P>
<P>
"But Li Hongzhi differed by saying that the earth would have
exploded, but that he personally delayed the catastrophe for
another 30 years, so that he could have enough time to do whatever
he wants," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Ye justified the government's efforts to crack down on Falun
Gong as necessary to "protect the safety of citizens and their
property and to maintain social stability."
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that "common practitioners should be treated
with sympathy, care and help, because they are the victims of Li
Hongzhi," adding that even the organizers, given that they were
manipulated and deceived, should be warmly embraced by the
government and society once they repent.
</P>
<P>
Ye also stressed that respect for freedom of belief does not
contradict the Party and the government's propagation of atheism.
</P>
<P>
"Respecting freedom of belief does not in any way mean
providing soil for the growth of superstition or cults, and China'
s religious circles understand this too," he said.

<HEADLINE> FBI Breaks Up Drug Network in 14 U.S. Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. federal agents conducted
drug raids in 14 cities Tuesday, arresting scores of people and
seizing drugs and money, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
announced.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to break up one of the top 20 drug distribution
networks in the country, the agents have seized 14 more kilograms
of cocaine, two Ferrari autos, a Land Rover and seven weapons,
including an AK-47 assault rifle, Assistant Director of Federal
Investigation Bureau (FBI) Thomas Pickard said.
</P>
<P>
By late Tuesday afternoon, 77 arrests were made, and more than
20 others were expected, FBI said.
</P>
<P>
The raids were carried out in New York City, Boston, Cleveland,
Chicago Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Albany, New York, and Nashville,
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
Pickard said the raids called Operation Southwest Express
disrupted "a major drug trafficking organization from its
distribution system to its retail sales."
</P>
<P>
FBI has arrested Omar Rocha Soto, head of the San Diego-based
organization, and three bothers of the Sotello-Lopez family from
their El Paso, Texas base. They were charged with drug trafficking,
money laundering and conspiracy.
</P>

dollars in cash.
</P>

Enforcement Administration, the Justice Department, Customs
Service, Internal Revenue Service and Immigration and
Naturalization Service. More than 50 state and local police

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Fraudulent Letters Rampant in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria continues to top the list
of letter fraud and related cases in the United States, making its
citizens prime suspects of crime in most parts of their host
cities, a local newspaper said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Postal Service said in a statement recently that it is
making efforts "to halt a scheme that relies upon international
mail to send letters offering fraudulent business proposals to
American addresses."
</P>
<P>
It added that postal inspectors have been cheated out of
nearly 100 million US dollars annually. Inspectors have
confiscated over four million fraudulent letters since March 1998,
 said the Guardian, a leading Nigerian paper.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the statement as saying that Americans are not
the only ones targeted, adding: "Letters also show up in Europe
and the Pacific Rim".
</P>
<P>
But the statement praised Nigerian postal authorities, saying
with their help "inspection service officials in the New York
division have developed a profile of letters and packages that may
be linked to the scam."
</P>
<P>
The statement explained that since U. S. postal inspectors have
seized over four million such letters in recent years, "the people
behind this scheme are trying something new".
</P>
<P>
Specifically, it said that "some letters now arrive in bulk
packaging via private courier". Once such packages are in the
U.S., it stated, "they are broken down to single letters, affixed
with U.S. postage or no postage and sent to other countries
bearing an American return address to disguise its west African
origin".
</P>
<P>
Many of such mails, about 2.3 million mainly coming from Lagos
and suspected to be fraudulent were reportedly packed together
and dumped last year in a landfill in Long Island, New York.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, U.S. federal investigators contend that
the Nigeria-U.S. axis mail fraud are part of what has been
described as "the oldest mail fraud scheme" in America dating
back to the 60s.
</P>
<P>
Under the defunct (Abdulsalam) Abubakar regime, the Central
Bank of Nigeria last October had placed advertisements in major
western papers, including the New York Times, warning Americans
and Europeans about the danger of such fraudulent letters.

its role, cherishes the traditional friendship between the two
countries, and is willing to join Malaysia to further enhance
cooperation in various fields in the hope that the two countries

</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that he had visited China several times. "I saw
China's progress and changes in each of my visit," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the prime minister, his current visit has two
missions: one is to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic ties between Malaysia and China and
the other is to further promote the development of the bilateral
relationship.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia will continue to adhere to the "One China"
policy. Also, he expressed the appreciation to China's agreement
in principle to sign a protocol pact on the neclear-weapon-free-
zone status of southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
He once again expressed his appreciation to China's responsible
attitude during the Asia financial crisis and its adherence to not
devaluing the Chinese currency.
</P>

trade and economic cooperation and exchanged views on furthering
such cooperation during the talks.

<HEADLINE> Dozen People Injured in Australia's Trains Collision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Around a dozen people were
injured Wednesday when a passenger train collided with a freight
train about 200 kilometers east of Kalgoorlie in the south of the
Western Australian (WA) state, police said.
</P>
<P>
The train of the Indian Pacific train service, carrying about
170 passengers, collided at low speed with a stationary freight
train Wednesday afternoon, cutting Australia's only east-west rail
link.
</P>
<P>
Australian police and the Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS)
said there were no major injuries with one RFDS plane carrying a
doctor already near the scene and another two on their way.
</P>
<P>
A RFDS spokesman said the train had been derailed.
</P>
<P>
"It has been derailed, and about 11 people will need RFDS
transport," he said.
</P>
<P>
But none of the injuries were believed to be serious, he added.
</P>
<P>
WA police inspector Alf Fordham said the Indian Pacific had
been traveling west on the trans-continental line at the time of
the crash.
</P>
<P>
National Rail spokesman Fred Affleck said there appeared to be
minimal damage to the trains and the track.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Pacific is a trans-continental train service,
linking Perth and Sydney via Adelaide.
</P>
<P>
The 4,352-kilometer journey takes two and a half days.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Pacific was formerly owned by Australian National
Railways but sold to the Great Southern Railway consortium in
1997.

<HEADLINE> Yajia, Pulling Contest Between Elephants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Nicknamed "pulling contest between
elephants", it isn't a zoo show. It's a traditional ethnic sport
formally called Yajia.
</P>
<P>
It's very much like the tug-of-war, in which two men or two
groups in the same category of weight try to pull each other and
one will be the winner if the stripe tied to the middle of the
solid band moves beyond the win-loss line in his direction.
</P>
<P>
But the two contestants will not use their hands but necks
which are hitched to the band by a hoop on each side, and they
need to straddle the band and squat down before they begin the
pulling contest.
</P>
<P>
Is it dangerous to use their neck instead of hands?
</P>
<P>
Li Mingzhao, the athlete with the Beijing delegation, said that
it is a safe sport because the band gets through between the legs.
</P>
<P>
"Without getting the band through between the legs, the neck is
in danger of being twisted after the band is stretched. Put the
tape through the legs can make sure the neck won't be injured," Li
said.
</P>
<P>
"And the hoop around the neck are cushioned with sponge which
will protect the neck from injury." he added.
</P>
<P>
A Tibetan athlete who studies in the Beijing Sports University
pointed out that the player is hard to win only dependent on the
neck.
</P>
<P>
"You are expected to put in action not only your neck but every
part of your body. For instance the force of the waist is also
very important in securing victory. In one word you need to put
all your body parts in concerted efforts," he said.
</P>
<P>
Duoji, deputy chief umpire, said that simple as it looks like,
Yajia is actually a competition not only of power but also
strategy.
</P>
<P>
"It is simple so there are so many spectators here, unlike the
top-whipping event which is hard to be taken in by the laymen. "
</P>
<P>
"But it is not only the competition of power, but also the
strategy. For example, some athletes do not exert fully his force
but just stay put until his opponent exhaust his force, then he
will explode to pull the tired opponent beyond."
</P>
<P>
"It can also test your psyche. The athlete need to be persevere
enough if he wants to make a comeback triumph."
</P>
<P>
The pulling contest, which has attracted a large number of
locals whether old or young, women or men, has upgraded from the
exhibition to competitive event.
</P>
<P>
"It originated from the daily life of the Tibetans, but it has
won popularity with the other ethnic groups, so it became the
competitive event in this games."

BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua)-- China plans to create a
population information network among 133 cities by the end of this
year, and build a national population information network within
three years, the Ministry of Public Security said here today.
</P>
<P>
The future network is expected to provide police units
nationwide with personal data on all citizens above the age of 16,
which will be aid local police in keeping track of the floating
population.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of the national information network will not
only modernize the management system of household registration,
but will also improve cooperation among police units nationwide,"
said a senior police officer with the ministry.
</P>
<P>
"But, first of all, the network will benefit economic
development," the officer said, explaining that it will prevent
criminals from using fake ID cards to apply for credit cards.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the national network also will give the
police access to the ID card number and picture of every citizen,
"as a result, criminals will have no opportunities," he said.
</P>
<P>
China began to manage population information with computers in
1985 in Jilin City in northeast China's Jilin Province, and by
1988, more than 500 cities nationwide had adopted the practice.

<HEADLINE> Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan Won't Be Saved by Foreign Powers, Newspaper (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is not incidental that Lee made his "two states" remark, the
commentary says. Lee has been deliberately planning to split the
motherland for a long time. Only recently did he sniff out some
seemingly favorable conditions, and then he brazenly tossed off
the statement.
</P>
<P>
This year's incidents such as NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia, the
U.S. attacks on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade and the passing of
the new Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation Guideline made Lee believe
that the time for realizing his scheme had arrived.
</P>
<P>
So, Lee lost no time in putting forward his "two states" remark,
with the hope that foreign powers would lend him a big hand in his
efforts to separate Taiwan from the motherland, the commentary
says.
</P>
<P>
However, Lee cannot expect to be saved by foreign powers, it
stresses.
</P>
<P>
Lee has made a miscalculation of the major tendency in the
world. He saw only the support of a small number of foreigners,
but not the fact that the majority of countries recognize that
there is only one China, and Taiwan is part of China.
</P>
<P>
After Lee's "two states" remark, nearly 100 countries,
including the United States and Japan, swiftly reiterated their
adherence to the "One China" principle, and much of the world
media reproached Lee for his provocative behavior.
</P>
<P>
All this has demonstrated that the current situation is not as
rosy as Lee had thought, and that there are few foreigners
supporting Lee, the commentary says.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- African governments have been
advised to develop sustainable networks for future utilization of
trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights and other
aspects of intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan Justice Minister Mayanja Nkangi said in a speech read
by a senior legal officer here Wednesday that the networks would
be tools for technological, economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
The minister assured the World International Property
Organization (WIPO) of Uganda's full support for all efforts being
directed toward the promotion of intellectual property rights
between agencies in Uganda and the region as well as the rest of
the world.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a two-week course attended by the participants from
15 African countries, Edward Kwakwa, a WIPO representative, said
that the course is part of the process to raise awareness about
aspects of international property rights in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The organization will enhance cooperation in legal technical
assistance for developing countries to strengthen national policy
and legislative frameworks and to build capacity for implementing
the agreement on property rights.

<HEADLINE> Lee Tung-hui of Taiwan Won't Be Saved by Foreign Powers, Newspaper (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the international community, there exist some forces that
support Lee's separatist attempts. However, when and to what
extend Lee will be supported, will be determined by their own
interests. Hoping for unconditional foreign support is simply the
wishful thinking of Lee himself, it says.
</P>
<P>
Lee has created a new crisis across the Taiwan Straits, and
brought turbulence to the entire Asian Pacific Region. It is quite
natural that Lee has been deemed "a troublemaker" by the
international community. "This has put Lee's reliance on foreign
powers at a discount," it says.
</P>
<P>
Lee cannot expect to be saved by foreign powers, since the
issue of Taiwan is China's internal affair which brooks no foreign
intervention, the commentary points out.
</P>
<P>
Lee's attempts to solicit foreign powers into interfering with
China's internal affairs have aroused the strong opposition of the
Chinese nation and the censure of the world media. "A just cause
enjoys abundant support, while an unjust cause finds little
support. Lee is doomed to failure," it says.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that no country will disregard legal principles,
morality and justice, be an enemy of the entire Chinese people,
and stake everything on a single throw, just for Lee's personal
ambition," the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
It reiterates that China's affairs should be solved by the
Chinese people themselves, especially major issues of principle,
such as national integrity and unity. "Those relying on foreign
powers have never come to a good end," the commentary notes.
</P>
<P>
"Now that Lee wants to follow in their footsteps, he is
destined to come to a disgraceful end and stand condemned through
the ages," it concludes.

<P>
MOSCOW, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Russia expressed on Wednesday its
concern over the allegedly Washington's attempt to derail the
Russian-Turkish "Blue Flood" gas pipeline project.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by the Foreign Ministry, Moscow said it
has reliable information about political and other pressure
mounted by certain U.S. officials to try to block the project.
</P>
<P>
Moscow is especially worried by allegations that supplies of
Russian fuel products may undermine political and economic
independence of the countries involved, the Interfax news agency
quoted the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ministry would like Russia's partners to refrain from using
such underhanded techniques as it runs counter to the generally
accepted principles of free trade, ethics of maintaining business
relations and the nature of Russian-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Russia and the United States are on the same wavelength about
the need for economic efficiency and the comprehensive application
of ecological and international legal standards, which are the
main criteria in the evaluation of projects to expand the oil and
gas delivery infrastructure of the Caspian and Black Sea regions,

<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- China should take effective
measures to promote the scientific and technological innovations
to make itself more competitive in the 21st Century, said Lu
Yongxiang, president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
China has to keep up with the latest development of high
technologies, and should not depend on the introduction of
advanced technologies from foreign countries, Lu told an
international symposium on "invigorating the country through
science and education" which opened in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government has decided to spend five
billion yuan (about 540 million U.S. dollars) to build a national
innovation system within three years, providing technological
support for the country's sustainable growth in the 21st Century.
A knowledge innovation project presided over by the CAS is
expected to help the country become one of the first ten countries
in terms of scientific and technological power by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The world will enter an age of knowledge-based economy, said Lu,
and the knowledge innovation has contributed 60 to 80 percent to
the economic development in some developed countries. The
knowledge and technological innovation capacity will become a key
factor for a country's competitiveness in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that China should promote the technological innovation
in enterprises, and encourage national research institutes and
colleges to become research centers for basic sciences and high
technology studies.
</P>
<P>
He said that the national information infrastructure should be
fully developed to provide an efficient and safe tele-
communication and computer network system for the public.
</P>
<P>
China should also develop software industry of its own
intellectual property rights and improve the technology in micro-
electronics and computer industries, said Lu, adding that the
studies in life science and biology should also be strengthened
while advanced technology of agriculture and pharmaceutical
industry be developed to improve people's health.

SNOW DRAGON SHIP, August 18 (Xinhua)-- The Chinese scientists
aboard the icebreaker Snow Dragon worried the final-phase of the
Arctic expedition might be affected by polar bears.
</P>
<P>
The expedition ship again encountered the snow-white
inhabitants of the Arctic Ocean early this morning while sailing
slowly in a floating-ice area.
</P>
<P>
Frequent appearance of the polar bears has brought anxiety
rather than excitement to the expedition members, who plan to set
up a working station on a piece of ice today to conduct the week-
long observation and research.
</P>
<P>
"Polar bears may impose difficulties to scientific research,
and every team member should be very careful about the safety,"
warned chief scientist Chen Liqi, who led the expedition team.
</P>
<P>
Around-the-clock patrols have been arranged to protect
scientists. Shooting is permitted only when the bear is 100 meters
close to attack man.
</P>
<P>
Xia Xinmin, who is in charge of the patrol, said they will try
their best not to hurt polar bears while ensuring the safety of
the scientists.
</P>
<P>
Polar bear is among the largest beasts on the earth. Living in
the Arctic region, it runs even faster than man.

JERUSALEM, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy summoned Egypt's Ambassador to Israel Mohamed Bassiouny
Wednesday, asking him to explain why Egypt refused to allow an
Israeli passenger plane to pass through its airspace.
</P>
<P>
A Boeing 747 with 329 passengers had to return to Tel Aviv
Tuesday night after air-controllers in Egypt denied it permission
to enter Egyptian airspace on its route to Bangkok, Israel Radio
said.
</P>
<P>
It was the third such incident involving Israeli aircraft in
the last 10 days, the radio said. Two charter planes to Kenya were
also denied permission to enter Egyptian airspace.
</P>
<P>
Director-General of the Foreign Ministry Eitan Bentsur met
Bassiouny Tuesday to express Israeli concerns over the incidents,
and the ambassador promised that the Egyptian government would
make a thorough investigation, officials with Israeli Foreign
Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Local media quoted Abdel Fatah Tutwul, head of Egypt's Civil
Aviation Authority, as saying that Israel had failed on occasion
to request permission to use Egyptian airspace.
</P>
<P>
Since Israel signed a peace treaty with Egypt in 1979, all
flights from Tel Aviv to Bangkok, Bombay, South Africa and Kenya
have passed over the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The export of biological
engineering, new materials and other new and high-tech products
will enjoy priority in using credit from the Export and Import
Bank of China (Eximbank), according to sources from the Eximbank.
</P>
<P>
President of Eximbank Yang Zilin said that his bank has
designed nine new steps in a bid to meet the growing financing
demand of the country's export.
</P>
<P>
He said the implementation of the new steps will help increase
policy financial support for the export of machinery, electronics
products and complete sets of equipment.
</P>
<P>
The bank will further step up its financing support to the
export of key industries, key districts, key enterprises and key
projects, with priority given to the export of new and high-tech
products.
</P>
<P>
Support to small enterprises and small projects will also be
increased, he said. Closed-end loans will be granted to State-
owned large and medium-sized enterprises with temporary losses but
have orders to guarantee the repayment.
</P>
<P>
Overseas assembling projects using materials from China will
also be backed by the Eximbank, he said, with focus on light
industry, textiles, family appliances and other industries with
equipment and technological advantages.
</P>
<P>
In light of difficulties in obtaining credit guarantees, the
Eximbank is also considering granting no-guarantee loans to credit
worthy conglomerates with good financial situation.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that to make full use of overseas capital and to
facilitate the implementation of the country's active fiscal
policy and industrial policies, the his bank will give priority to
transportation, environmental protection, forestry and water
conservation projects, as well as the central and western areas of
the country in loans from foreign governments in the latter half
of the year.

<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- A three-day conference of
Chinese officials in charge of Taiwan affairs ended here today
after heated and in-depth discussions about Lee Teng-hui's "two-
state" remarks.
</P>
<P>
It was pointed out at the national conference of heads of
offices of Taiwan affairs that the "two-state" remarks have fully
exposed Lee Teng-hui's ambition to split the motherland, and has
enraged Chinese people both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The "two-state" claim could jeopardize Taiwan's social and
economic development, and hurt the immediate interests of Taiwan
compatriots, the conference warned.
</P>
<P>
"The assertion not only destroys the foundation of political
dialogue and negotiations between the two sides of the Taiwan
Straits, but also goes against the will of most people on the
island."
</P>
<P>
The conference stressed the importance of adhering to the "One
Country, Two Systems" principle and Chinese President Jiang Zemin'
s eight-point proposition on the Taiwan issue, and warned Lee Teng-
hui and the Taiwan authorities not to underestimate the firm
resolve of the Chinese government to safeguard state sovereignty,
dignity and territorial integrity, or the courage and strength of
the Chinese people to fight against separation.
</P>
<P>
Those attending the conference said that they would do their
utmost to realize the reunification through peaceful means and
vowed not to give up the use of force.
</P>
<P>
They said that Lee Teng-hui deceives the people of Taiwan by
saying he intends to go on with reunification negotiations without
recanting his "two-state" and "special state-to-state relations"
remarks, and they called on the Taiwan authorities to openly
abandon those remarks and return to the "One China" principle as
soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> India Develops Electron Accelerator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Indian Bhabha Atomic Research
Center (BARC) is reportedly in the final stages of assembling a
powerful electron accelerating machine, which can potentially be
used as a beam weapon.
</P>
<P>
The machine, developed by Mumbai-based BARC, would be ready for
testing by the end of the year, the Press Trust of India (PTI)
said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
When aimed at enemy missiles and aircraft, Indian scientists
claimed, bursts of microwaves packed with gigawatts of power
produced by this machine, named "KALI-5000," would cripple their
electronics systems and computer chips and bring them down.
</P>
<P>
However, India's beam weapon in the present form was too bulky
with a weight of 26 tons including tanks containing 12,000 liters
of oil, PTI said, quoting P. H. Ron, head of the accelerator and
pulse power division at BACR and KALI's chief designer.
</P>
<P>
KALI, kilo-ampere linear injector, was developed for industrial
applications and that the defense use was a recent spin-off,
according to Ron.
</P>
<P>
Development of KALI machine, described as India's first star
war weapon, was initiated in 1985 by then BARC director
Rajagopalam Chidambaram, now chairman of India's Atomic Energy
Commission, but work began earnestly in 1989.
</P>
<P>
BARC scientists claimed that the KALI machine has for the first
time provided India with a way to "harden" the electronic systems
used in satellites and missiles against the deadly electromagnetic
impulses generated by nuclear weapons.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Cut More Than Third of Its Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is to trim 30,000 of armed
forces so as to make its army more compact and better equipped,
said the country's Defense Minister Theophilus Danjuma.
</P>
<P>
Danjuma said that the new Nigerian armed forces will be "fully
professionalized, better equipped and completely subordinated to
civil political authority," the Guardian newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria currently has an 80,000-strong armed forces and the
planned trimming would cut across the Army, Navy, and Air Force,
to reduce the figure to 50,000, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
While describing it commendable, the minister, rumored to have
resigned at the weekend, said the continuing dominance by Nigeria
in the west African peace-keeping force (ECOMOG) will not be in
the country's long-term interest because of its enormous cost
compared with other competing needs for resources at home.
</P>
<P>
Danjuma called on the international community, particularly the
 United States, to assist in demobilizing the men, through
training for self- employment.
</P>
<P>
He also advocates training of the personnel in service, saying
Nigeria would appreciate placement of its officers in foreign
military institutions, particularly in schools of armory,
artillery, signals and infantry. This becomes imperative because
the corps schools in Nigeria need to be refurbished, and their
equipment rehabilitated.
</P>
<P>
The minister, a former Chief of Army Staff, decried the state of
 the Air Force fleet, saying that of the eight C-130 Hercules
aircraft, only one is serviceable.
</P>
<P>
On June 11, an unprecedented gale of retirement was unleashed on
the military and police by the new administration of President
Olusegun Obasanjo, making a clean sweep of officers who had held
political offices from 1985 to date.
</P>
<P>
A total of 93 officers were affected in the purge which
government spokesman Doyin Okupe described as part of
"far-reaching measures that will ensure permanent subordination
of the military to civil authority".
</P>
<P>
The measures were a "painful decision", but also "a
necessity," he added.
</P>
<P>
The history of the Nigerian Army dates back to 1897 with the
formation of West Africa Frontier Force (WAFF) by Frederic Lugard.
</P>
<P>
By 1941, military units were formed with a total of 250 men. By
1960 when the country attained its independence, there were 10,000
soldiers. The population grew to 250,000 in 1970 at the end of
the civil war.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- General Secretary of the
Communist Party of Greece (KKE) Aleka Papariga praised China's
progress made over the past five decades, saying the great changes
have made China a focus of world attention.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Xinhua, she said many profound
changes have taken place in China since the founding of the People
's Republic of China in 1949, especially from 1978 when the late
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping initiated the opening-up and reform
policy.
</P>
<P>
"China is no longer the semi-feudal and semi-colonial country
it used to be before 1949, but one that is developing rapidly, so
much that it has become a center of analysts' attention," she said.
</P>
<P>
The general secretary described the rapid development in China
as "not casual," saying that it was the opening-up and reform
policy that had led to the significant progress in China,
especially in the economic field.
</P>
<P>
She believed that China's steady growth will undoubtedly
benefit both Asia and the whole world.
</P>
<P>
"When we speak about China's international status and role, we
are keeping in mind a country with one-fourth of the world's
population. Without this one-fourth, we cannot talk about world
security and peace, or even about the world at all," she said,
adding that China has a very active role to play and that efforts
to prevent it from doing so are doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
Papariga expressed the hope that China would strengthen its
ties with European countries in order to promote principles
leading to a more equitable international economic order, peace,
non-intervention into the internal affairs of other countries
under various pretexts, such as human rights and ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
She is confident that China will have a brighter future,
adding that as far as prospects are concerned, its developing
momentum will clearly be maintained.
</P>
<P>
She added that China is showing a robust growing tendency at a
time when Southeast Asia is facing financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Papariga also hoped for strengthened ties between the KKE and
the Communist Party of China (CPC).

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Police Chief Laments Crime Upsurge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Inspector-General of
Police Alhaji Musiliu Smith has lamented that the police force in
the country had been tasked by myriad of problems and events in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with retired police inspectors general held
Tuesday in capital Abuja, he said that in the northeastern and
northwestern parts of the country, "armed bandits from
neighboring countries have made life unbearable for the
inhabitants to the extent that commercial and social activities
are almost grounded to a halt," the New Nigerian newspaper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"In the western and eastern states, waves of armed robbery and
unsolved murder cases are increasing on daily basis," Smith said.
</P>
<P>
The inspector-general complained of a phenomenal rise in the
incidence of communal, ethnic and religious clashes in some parts
of the country, some of which, he said, had become an endless
crises.
</P>
<P>
He lamented the enormous challenges of policing the country in
a democratic setting and advised the police to concentrate more on
its major constitutional duties.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Lagos State Governor, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu,
Tuesday linked the recent increase in crime rate in the state to
the activities of enemies of democracy who were determined to
sabotage the new democratic settings.

<HEADLINE> Havard Scholar: Falun Gong Cult Should Be Combated In Any Country </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua)-- Havard scholar Kai-Alexander
Schlevogt has refuted Western media's attack on the Chinese
Government's ban on Falun Gong, saying that the cult, given its
danger to society, should be combated in any country.
</P>
<P>
"Cults of any kind, such as Falun Gong in China, are dangerous
for society in any country and have to be combated with all means,
" writes Schlevogt, a faculty member of both the Harvard Business
School and Harvard Fairbank Center for East Asian Research, Asian
Center, in an article published in today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The mass media has concentrated on the development of the Falun
Gong cult in China in recent weeks, he says, "The foreign media
was quick to attack China's determined efforts to protect its
citizens from life-threatening manipulative practices."
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately," he notes, "the allegedly objective media was
silent about the fact that there are thousands of Qigong groups in
China," who had always had the freedom to pursue their hobby.
Neither did it mention that Falun Gong is a cult, not a simple
association of practitioners.
</P>
<P>
Instead, foreign media described Falun Gong as a harmless
meditation group, which could not seriously cause any damage to
China, just "to make China look ridiculous in the eyes of
Westerners," "as always in this type of criticism," he says.
</P>
<P>
Schlevogt points out that cults usually have secret hierarchies,
request obedience and engage in personality cults for their
founders who wield absolute authority. Their aim is "to amass
great wealth and power for the organization and the leader himself.
"
</P>
<P>
Falun Gong "engages in pyramid schemes, a fact which Western
media does not mention," he says. For example, the cult has
manipulated its followers to believe blindly in the words of their
leader. They refute medical advice because of their belief in the
"supernatural power" of their leader. "This often costs them their
lives," he adds.
</P>
<P>
The author says that given all these dangers and abuses, people
should thank the Chinese Government for taking a determined stance
to uphold its long-standing values and act as a mighty fortress
for the welfare of its citizens. "This decisive action is
especially important, given that cults eliminate the individual's
ability to protect himself. The followers of Falun Gong are
trapped without knowing it, the real culprits are their leaders."
</P>
<P>
There is religious freedom for people in China, but
manipulative cults should not be tolerated here and elsewhere, he
says.

<HEADLINE> Gold Demand Rises 16 Percent in Second Quarter of 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Gold demand witnessed a year-
on-year increase of 16 percent for the second quarter of 1999,
with the demand in the countries and regions monitored by the
World Gold Council (WGC) reaching 810 tons, announced the WGC
Wednesday in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The WGC said the strong performance resulted from a combination
of a gain of 13 percent in worldwide jewelry demand and a 32
percent increase in investment over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Gold demand set new second quarter records in India, the world'
s largest consumer, and in the United States, the Arabian Gulf
States and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Haruko Fukuda, chief executive of the WGC, said in a press
conference: "The figures are very encouraging, not least because
they suggest firm indications of the economic recovery now taking
place in Asia, where the resurgence in gold demand indicates a
continuing faith in gold as a store of value."
</P>
<P>
George Milling-Stanley, manager of Gold Market Analysis of WGC,
said gold demand for the first half of 1999 hit a record 1,598
tons, which is no less than 35 percent higher than in the opening
six months of last year.

<HEADLINE> EU To Provide Aid For Turkey Quake Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) is
going to provide a first package of humanitarian aid for victims
of the earthquake that hit Turkey on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive body, said on
Wednesday that it had cleared the aid package worth of two million
euros (2.1 million U.S. dollars) as the first emergency step for
helping the victims in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive's humanitarian office will manage the aid in
close cooperation with the Turkish Red Crescent. Under EU's
arrangement, the "immediate relief supplies" will be handed to the
worst affected areas by the International Federation of the Red
Cross and Red Crescent (IFRC).
</P>
<P>
The funds will also be allocated to other partners of non-
governmental organizations "as the situation evolves and emergency
teams are being sent to the region," the Commission said.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake is described as the worst since the 1976 quake
in Tangshan, China.
</P>
<P>
The death toll has risen to at least 3,000 with rescue workers
still searching for survivors. Initial international relief
efforts are focused on search and rescue operations.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission predicts that the need for relief
supplies, such as food, medical care, tents, blankets and mobile
kitchens, will grow over the next few days.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive said it is closely monitoring the situation in
Turkey in order to prepare further necessary aid for the victims.

<HEADLINE> New Food Act Expected to Boost Thai Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 18 (Xinhua) -- A new food act, to be passed
within this year, will help increase competitiveness of Thai food
exporters and upgrade Thai food products to the international
standards, the Thai News Agency (TNA) reported here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the new act, food origins must be traceable in the event
of irregularities and exporters would face penalties for
misleading and exaggerated advertisements, the official news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
Food manufacturers and exporters would need to inform the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) of their plans of improving quality
and standards, and apply for export permissions, rather than
proceeding with piles of paper work to authorities previously
concerned with export permissions, FDA Secretary-General Mongkol
Na Songkhla was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Despite the new challenges in keeping up with changing rules
and international demands, Thai food exporters are reported to
welcome the new law as it would give them more flexibility and
freedom from bureaucratic red tape that had dragged on their
businesses.
</P>
<P>
The new act comes at a time when the Thai government has
announced a set target of 5 percent export growth target for next
year.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General of the Thai Chamber of Commerce Viroj
Amatakulchai said that it was highly likely that the targeted
export growth would be achieved, as the government's latest
stimulus package on August 10 would bear good fruits next year.
</P>
<P>
But he was not sure whether this year's export target of 4
percent growth will be achieved.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months this year, Thailand's exports were at
31.9 billion U.S. dollars, leaving each of the rest five months
with a 4.9 billion dollar target in order to achieve the projected
56.4 billion dollars for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports here said that the International Monetary
Fund is likely to raise Thailand's export growth forecast for 1999
from 2 percent to 3.5 percent due to the improvement of Thailand's
exports in the first seven months.

<HEADLINE> Taiwanese Should Better Understand "One Country, Two Systems" Principle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Visiting members from the
Taiwan-based "Alliance for the Reunification of China" Wednesday
said more efforts should be made to promote the "one country, two
systems" principle among the people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Publicity of the successful implementation of the "one country,
two systems" in Hong Kong will help increase Taiwan people's
awareness of the principle, noted the members during a visit to
the One Country Two Systems Research Institute in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Shiu Sin-por, executive director of the institute, said Hong
Kong goes well under the "one country, two systems" principle, and
there is no significant change after the return of Hong Kong to
China.
</P>
<P>
Some people of Taiwan hope to maintain their current lifestyle,
and the "one country, two systems" principle is the very
expression of their wish, said Chyung-en Wu, president of the "
Alliance for the Reunification of China."
</P>
<P>
Wu said people on both sides across the Taiwan Straits should
have common understanding on the basis of "one China," and
everything can be discussed under the "one China" principle.
</P>
<P>
Different from Germany, China's sovereignty has never separated,
and Lee Teng-hui's "two states" theory is totally groundless, said
Wu.
</P>
<P>
The 22-member Taiwan delegation arrived in Hong Kong Tuesday,
following their visit to Beijing and Shanghai. Delegation members
returned to Taiwan in the afternoon.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Militants Become POWs in Namibia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Seven militants from the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) became
prisoners of war (POWs) in the southern neighboring country of
Namibia, local newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
UNITA militants were apprehended by the Namibian government
troops during a counter-attack against the separatist Liberation
Army of Caprivi, which has mounted a series of assaults on
government facilities since August 2 in the northeast strip of the
territory called Caprivi Strip.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian military has not yet decided how to deal with the
POWs from the UNITA movement led by Jonas Savimbi, said Martin
Shalli, chief general- staff of the Namibian Army.
</P>
<P>
"The secessionists have no more money for basic necessities,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
In a speech made Tuesday in Maputo, capital of Mozambique, at
the meeting of the Southern African Development Community (SADC),
Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos warned his counterparts
against the incursion of UNITA troops into Namibia and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that up to now, the separatists, who fight for
the break- away of Caprivi from Namibia, have been defeated and
repelled by the Namibian government troops and fled to neighboring
countries of Angola and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Namibian President Sam Nujoma said that the Angolan and Zambian
 governments had promised to help pursue the Namibian separatist
militants.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Iran's New Judiciary Chief Promises Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran's new judiciary chief
Ayatollah Seyyed Mohmoud Hashemi Shahroudi Wednesday promised
the judiciary, a conservative power organ, will be more
cooperative than before with the moderate government headed by
President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
"As you are following the program of political development, it
is necessary for the judiciary to pursue a judicial development as
well, because part of political success depends on judicial
development," Hashemi said when Khatami called on him at his
office to extend congratulations.
</P>
<P>
The two expressed willingness to cooperate in order to solve
the country's problems in a better way.
</P>
<P>
Hashemi was appointed by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
on August 14 to succeed Mohammad Yazdi, whose two five-year terms
ended on the day.
</P>
<P>
Yazdi, a hard line conservative, was furiously attacked by the
moderate faction for factionalism in the legal field by putting
reformist officials behind bars and shutting down pro-Khatami
newspapers. Hashemi, however, is believed to be a
conservative-prone, but relatively neutral figure.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said Hashemi's presence in the judiciary was
"inspiring" because he wanted to "render services and introduce
reforms." "Your character encourages all pundits and jurists to
work with you, and this is a matter of hope for the government,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's moderate government had been at odds with other
power organs such as the Majlis (parliament) and the judiciary,
controlled by the conservative faction.
</P>
<P>
When Hashemi was introduced to the new post Tuesday, he said
the judiciary will not engage in factionalism, apparently in an
attempt to appease moderates' doubt about his future performance.
</P>
<P>
Four days ago, Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance
Ataollah Mohajerani said at a press conference that he hoped
under the leadership of Hashemi, no pro-reform newspapers will be
banned by the judiciary.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Told Not to Worry About Earthquake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 18 (Xinhua) -- After Turkey was hit by the
disastrous earthquake, Lebanese seismologists Wednesday came out
to dispel widespread fear among residents that a similar
earthquake will take place in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The area where Lebanon lies is totally separated from the
ones where Turkey and Cyprus locate," said a statement from the
state-run Lebanese Center for Earthquake Research.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that there is no reason for any concern because the
crustal movement in Lebanon is currently quiet and the center has
not gained any signs and information of earthquake in the country.
</P>
<P>
Turkey was hit early Tuesday by a powerful earthquake which
killed more than 2,000 people and injured over 10,000 others.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, the eclipse day, Lebanon's another neighboring
country Cyprus was struck by a moderate earthquake which slightly
affected parts of Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> UPU Chief: Beijing Congress to Open New Page in Global Postal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The 22nd Congress of the
Universal Postal Union (UPU) to be held in Beijing from August 23
to September 15 is an extremely important event for the postal
community worldwide at the turn of the century when postal
services face many new challenges, the UPU chief has said.
</P>
<P>
The major event that happens every five years "obviously is an
important moment for the UPU for two reasons", UPU Director
General Thomas Leavey told Xinhua in an exclusive interview at the
UPU headquarters in the Swiss capital of Berne before he left for
Beijing to attend the congress. so far, more than 2,200 people
from 170 countries and 31 international organizations have entered
their names as intended participants.
</P>
<P>
"First of all, China itself is a very important member of the
UPU, the world's most populous country with enormous growth
potential," Leavey said.
</P>
<P>
The key role that China plays in international relations, being
a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, also
adds a lot of weight to the congress, he said.
</P>
<P>
China will lead the UPU to the 21st century as China will
chairman of the UPU's ruling Council of Administration for the
next five years, Leavey said.
</P>
<P>
"The second reason is the issues that are important in postal
policy," the UPU chief said. "We have a lot of changes that are
taking place in the postal world."
</P>
<P>
"There are movements toward deregulation, and liberalization of
postal services in many countries, which means that the postal
service which formerly was a governmental service is being more
and more considered as a commercial service, open to competition
by private sector firms," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the challenges the postal service is facing,
Leavey, an American, made a comparison between the Beijing
congress in 1999 and the Washington congress at the end of the
19th century when China formally joined the UPU.
</P>
<P>
"As the people in Washington in 1897 looked to the turn of the
century, they had a lot of challenges. As we look to the new
century now in Beijing, we also have many challenges," he said.
</P>
<P>
"At that time, for example, there was a perceived threat to
postal volume by telegraph and the new invention of telephone," he
said. "Today some people see a threat to postal volume because of
new technologies of Internet and electronic mail."
</P>
<P>
The UPU director General said that he is very confident that
the 189 UPU members will meet the challenges bravely and develop
the postal services in various ways.
</P>
<P>
"Now we, of course, need to adjust to technological
developments. And we are not pessimistic that physical mail will
completely disappear," he said.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, he said, a recent UPU study shows there
will be moderate growth in physical mail of about three percent a
year on average throughout the world up to the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
"The growth rate in China, however, is much higher, estimated
between 9 to 10 percent a year. As China develops and continues to
develop," postal services in China will develop rapidly, he said.
</P>
<P>
Leavey said that, with the tremendous work done by the Chinese
in preparing the 22nd Universal Postal Congress, he believed the
congress in Beijing will be a great success and open a new page in
the UPU history.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Housebuyers Using Internet Save Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Consumers in the United
States using Internet spend half the time in identifying and
purchasing a house compared to traditional buyers, according to a
survey released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Internet buyers are likely to spend two and a half months from
selecting a realtor to their house purchase decision, compared to
an average of five months spent by traditional buyers, said the
California Association of Realtors, which conducted the survey in
the second quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Compared to traditional buyers, the association said, Internet
buyers spend half the time -- a median period of four weeks,
looking for a house with an agent prior to purchase. They preview
and visit only four houses, compared to eight for traditional ones.
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent of Internet buyers surveyed agreed that
Internet helped them in the buying process. Most of them said
Internet gave them help in dealing and selecting the location with
the best possible neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
While all traditional buyers drive around and preview houses
and neighborhood, only half of Internet buyers do so. 16 percent
of Internet buyers use newspaper advertising, compared with 76
percent of traditional buyers.
</P>
<P>
Internet buyers said their realtors used such technological
tools as e-mail, Web sites and listing on Internet.
</P>
<P>
On average, Internet buyers visited six Web sites to find a
realtor or broker, used eight Web sites to get listing information
and two sites to get mortgage information.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Laos agree to Delay Railway Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The governments of Thailand and
Laos have agreed to postpone the two country's first railway
network until the regional economic crisis is over, an advisor of
the contractor said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Gun Nagamati, advisor of Pacific Transportation Co., was quoted
by Thailand News Agency as saying that his company discussed the
problem with the Lao government on August 10 and the latter agreed
to an indefinite delay due to the economic crunch.
</P>
<P>
The company's representatives informed the Lao authorities that
their partners and creditors prefer the delay because the demand
for railway service has declined by as much as 40 percent from
earlier expectations, Gun said.
</P>
<P>
Pacific Transportation has also proposed to reduce its stake in
the railway project from 75 percent if the Lao government can find
other partners to help implement it.
</P>
<P>
However, Gun confirmed that his company would not abandon the
project and believed the Lao government would not revoke the
contract due to the delay.
</P>
<P>
The company was granted a concession by the Lao government last
year to build a 1,000-kilometer railway network. The project was
supposed to start with a 14-kilometer railway line, estimated at
32 million U.S. dollars, from Vientiane across the Mekong river on
the Thai-Lao friendship bridge to the northeastern gateway
province of Nong Khai in Thailand.

<P>
They can also contact any State Public Library which acts as
the central point linking both contributors and readers, she said.

She said that even with the existence of the Internet, books
were still the main menu in any library.

PARIS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Police of France and Britain are

</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse quoted police sources as saying on

The immigration law of Britain is more tolerant than that of
France, especially in the field of political asylum.

Many immigrants from Algeria, Albania, Romania, Afghanistan,
Sri Lanka and Iraq are trying to take advantage of the wave of

political asylum in Britain, said police.

French police and customs officials are increasing control of

The Daily Nation newspapers reported Wednesday that commercial
bank's average base lending rate rose to 20.26 percent last week
from 19.94 percent in the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Negotiators Make Progress on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators have made progress on the issue of Palestinian
prisoners in their latest talks, agreeing to draw up a list of 650
prisoners for review, Israel Radio reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak's envoy Gilad Sher and senior
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat met for more than five hours
in Jerusalem Tuesday evening after they failed to resolve
difference on a timetable for the implementation of the Wye
agreement in their previous negotiations.
</P>
<P>
In their latest talks, the negotiators set aside the major
issue of timetable and focused on issues including the safe
passages between the West Bank and Gaza and the release of
Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
"The talks were substantial, positive and warm, with progress
being made on all issues on the agenda," Barak's office said in a
statement Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A joint Israeli-Palestinian committee on the matter of
prisoners, which met Tuesday for the first time, would meet again
to examine the list of prisoners, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said after the late-night talks that he expected Israel
to release the political prisoners, or those were jailed for
anti-Israel activities, before implementation of the Wye accord
begins on September 1.
</P>
<P>
Under the Wye accord, Israel is to release 750 Palestinian
political prisoners in three stages. Barak's predecessor Benjamin
Netanyahu ordered the release of 250 prisoners last November, but
most of the released were common criminals instead of political
prisoners the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) had required.
</P>
<P>
The dispute sparked weeks of bloodiest violence in years
between Palestinians and Israeli soldiers in the West Bank and
Gaza.
</P>
<P>
There have been signs that the new moderate government of
Barak would ease the criteria for the release of prisoners to
include more political ones on the list.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami from the Labor Party
said Tuesday that there is logic in Palestinians' demand that all
political prisoners be released under the framework of a permanent
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Israel's security cabinet will hold a special meeting later on
Wednesday to discuss the release issue, Israeli media said.
</P>
<P>
The government is looking into the possibility that
accessories to terrorist actions ending in bloodshed shall not be
considered terrorists "with blood on their hands," the media
reported.
</P>
<P>
Since taking office on July 6, Barak has promised to carry out
the Wye agreement, but he has been at odds with PNA Chairman
Yasser Arafat over when the implementation would be completed.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, Israel has to hand over another 11 percent of
the West Bank to the Palestinians in the last two
stages. Netanyahu suspended the agreement in early December after
turning over 2 percent in first stage.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have reached agreement on Barak's proposal to
restart the accord on September 1 and carry out the second stage
of troop withdrawal on October 1.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinians have repeatedly rejected Barak's
suggestion to postpone the final stage of redeployment until
February 2000, when the final-status talks dealing with thorny
issues like Jerusalem and settlements are supposed to have been
well under way.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have said that the final stage should be
completed by mid-November in line with the original timetable of
the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
The local daily Haaretz reported Wednesday that Israel is now
taking a more flexible stance and proposing to complete the final
redeployment by January 15, one month before the date originally
proposed by Barak.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted diplomatic sources as saying that the
Palestinians are prepared to accept a completion of the
redeployment by the end of December or the beginning of January.
</P>
<P>
If the Palestinians agree to the new timeline proposed by the
Israeli side, Israel is prepared to begin implementing the second
stage of troop withdrawal before October 1, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Speeds Up Construction of Flood Control Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is boosting
infrastructural construction for agriculture, especially the
construction of irrigation projects for flood control.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government invested more than 1,854 billion
Vietnamese dong (132.4 million U.S. dollars) in infrastructural
construction for agriculture in the first seven months of 1999,
accounting for 77.8 percent of the yearly plan, according to a
report of the Vietnam News Agency on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The sum was disbursed in construction of irrigation projects.
</P>
<P>
Nine of 11 irrigation projects for flood control have been
fulfilled as scheduled, and judged as up to the standards of the
flood diversion projects.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government will invest an additional 640 billion
Vietnamese dong (45.7 million U.S. dollars) in building irrigation
projects in the remaining period of this year. Vietnam's Ministry
of Agriculture and Rural Development has assigned relevant
agencies to build these projects.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam had overfulfilled the plan on building infrastructural
projects for irrigation, agriculture, forestry and rural
development in 1998 by 12 percent with a total investment capital
of 2,488 billion Vietnamese dong (180 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government is focusing its limited capital on
key projects with a view to raising efficiency. Vietnam's
construction sector speeded up the construction of key flood
control projects and completed 51 projects, including 35
irrigation ones in 1998.

<HEADLINE> SADC Summit Opens in Mozambican Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The 19th Summit of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) opened here Wednesday morning
with its theme of "SADC in the Next Millennium: Working Together
for Peace, Progress and Prosperity."
</P>
<P>
After a short opening ceremony at the City Hall in Mozambican
capital Maputo, the leaders or representatives of the 14 member
states closed themselves up.
</P>
<P>
They will discuss issues on the conflicts in Angola, and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the relations between
Angola and Zambia and the elections in Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of a military intervention in Angola has almost
been ruled out as Angola insists that the SADC should do what it
was created for.
</P>
<P>
However, Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos said at the
celebration meeting in Maputo on the SADC Day Tuesday that his
government will not negotiate with the UNITA rebels.
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos said that the National Union for Total Independence
of Angola (UNITA) led by Jonas Savimbi has violated the
U.N.-brokered 1994 Lusaka Peace Accord by renewing the civil war.
</P>
<P>
And the Angolan president demanded that the Lusaka peace accord
should still be the base of any new peace initiative for Angola.
</P>
<P>
Host Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano also said that "we
must condemn all forces of the region that use violence and crime
as means to conquer power."
</P>
<P>
Zambian president Frederic Chilluba is expected to deliver a
report on the DRC peace process as required by the last summit in
Mauritius last September.
</P>
<P>
Chilluba did not appear at the celebration meeting Tuesday and
Chissano said that the Zambian president was busy on his DRC
report.
</P>
<P>
On the economic scene, the regional leaders will review the
performance of member states in the past year and the negative
effect on economy in individual country and the region as a whole
of the continuing armed conflicts in some SADC countries.
</P>
<P>
The leaders will focus on the food security situation in the
region which needs some 2.88 million tons of cereals for the
1999/2000 marketing year.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the leaders may again voice their
call for more debt relief for the poor countries, especially those
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The service of external debt in African countries including the
majority of the SADC members reaches some 30 percent of their
total public revenues, diverting much money from the basic needs
in such areas as health, education, water and others.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique has just achieved the relief of a part of its
external debt under the Heavily-Indebted Poor Countries
initiative.
</P>
<P>
But Chissano, who is also the Vice Chairman of the SADC, said
that the weight of debt is still hight if the socio-economic
reality of his country is taken into consideration.
</P>
<P>
He further noted that "the partial cancellation is not the
solution."
</P>
<P>
The leaders are also expected to sign on two protocols, one on
wildlife conservation and law enforcement, and the other on
health, as well as a declaration of productivity.
</P>
<P>
The sale of gold by Britain and the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) will be addressed too at the Maputo summit.
</P>
<P>
Due to urgent calls back home, DRC President Laurent Kabila did
not attend the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, who arrived in Maputo Monday and was supposed to make a
 statement at the SADC Day celebration, went back to Kinshasa
Tuesday to deal with urgent domestic affairs. Founding fathers
of the regional organizations such as Nelson Mandela, Kenneth
Kaunda also attended the opening.

PARIS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- More than 3,000 people were killed and 10,000 wounded in the
violent earthquake which struck northwest Turkey at dawn on
Tuesday at 6.7 degrees on the Richter scale and lasting 45 seconds.
In Istanbul, Turkey's number one city, many people were killed by
jumping from the windows of their apartments, while Izmit, the
industrial and economic center of Turkey, was severely hit.
</P>
<P>
-- Russian former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov announced on
Tuesday that he would lead the list of the party of Moscow mayor
Yuri Lujkov in the legislative elections to be held in December,
which signaled his return to the battle for the presidential
election in 2000. The announcement was a bad news for the Kremlin
as two of its most dangerous rivals have got together.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The war against Iraq being launched by the United States and
Britain has become a war which no one wants to talk about and
could be forgotten by the public opinion. The air raids against
Iraq by American and British warplanes are going on day after day
while the Iraqi regime does not show any sign of weakness. The
United Nations is due to debate the French proposal on the lifting
of oil embargo against Iraq after the summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
-- British cattle raisers have asked their government to impose
a control of imports of French chickens because of allegation that
French chicken farms are using purification mud to feed the
wingless birds. From mad cow to dioxin chicken, from American
hormone beef to genetically transfered organism, Europeans are
more and more sceptical about the quality of their food.

<HEADLINE> Charter-change Hoopla Blamed for Philippine Stock Market Slump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Finance Secretary
Edgardo Espiritu blamed Wednesday the sudden slump of the stock
market on the continuous charter-change hoopla which eventually
led to a rift between the government and the Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu said many observers think changes in the 1987
Constitution are urgently needed particularly on the economic
aspects considering that some of them are no longer attuned to the
present conditions in the country.
</P>
<P>
The finance chief noted that because many opponents of the
charter-change threat to sow chaos during their nationwide rallies
on Friday, many foreign fund investors have pulled out their
investments in the equities market.
</P>
<P>
At the Philippine Stock Exchange, the 33-share composite index
tumbled as much as 4.05 percent to 2,087.13 points on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu believed, however, that these foreign fund managers
who decided to withdraw their investments and shifted them
elsewhere will return when apprehensions spawned by the rallies on
charter-change are over.
</P>
<P>
Notably, foreign fund investors are sensitive to economic
jitters so that they do not want to gamble in a situation that
will put their investments in a negative situation, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Espiritu, this is something which the government
cannot prevent because there is no law that is applicable to this
effect.
</P>
<P>
But he expressed confidence that the influx of foreign fund
investments into the country will normalize after the mist of
doubts on the charter-change rallies is ironed out next week.

<HEADLINE> Two Israeli Soldiers Killed in Southern Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Israel confirmed Wednesday
that two of its soldiers were killed and seven others wounded
Tuesday in clashes with Hezbollah guerrillas in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The clashes are the fiercest that occurred in south Lebanon
since Israel launched a large-scale air raids on Lebanon in June,
avenging the killing of Israeli civilians in northern Israel, in
which 10 Lebanese were killed, Israeli media reported.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, St.-Sgt. Eyal Gueta, 21, was killed in a clash
between a squad of Israeli soldiers and Hezbollah guerrillas in
the thick bush of Wadi Salouki in the Israeli-occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
The two sides encountered again when the Israeli army tried to
evacuate the casualties, in which Sgt. Doron Hershkowitz, 20, was
killed.
</P>
<P>
Seven others, including a battalion commander, were wounded in
the two fightings, with three of them in serious condition. The
army said three Hezbollah guerrillas were killed in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
The deaths brought to 12 the number of Israeli soldiers killed
in southern Lebanon this year.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, is leading a war of attrition to
oust Israeli troops and their allied South Lebanon Army from a
15-kilometer deep occupation zone in south Lebanon Israel carved
out in 1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes struck back, repeatedly raiding suspected
Hezbollah positions inside the zone. Fierce artillery, mortar and
rocket firings raged for nearly four hours after the killings.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah announced that the gunfight was in retaliation for
the death of Ali Deeb, a regional Hezbollah field commander, who
was killed Monday by two roadside bombs outside the port city of
Sidon in Lebanon. Hezbollah blamed Israel for the death.
</P>
<P>
But Chief of Israel's Northern Command Gabi Ashkenazi denied
there was any connection between the clashes and the death of
Deeb, who was on the top of Israel's most wanted list for
carrying out attacks against the Israeli army in southern
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz Tuesday also denied
Hezbollah's charges that Israel was behind the death of Deeb,
suggesting that the killing might have been the result of an
internal struggle among guerrilla groups.
</P>
<P>
The latest Israeli casualties will undoubtedly enhance a
domestic cry for a quick Israeli withdrawal from the occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
Assuming office in early July, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak has promised to pull Israeli troops out of southern Lebanon
within a year through negotiations with Syria, Beirut's main
power-broker.
</P>
<P>
Before the news of the fatalities was released to the public,
Barak said Tuesday that Israel would continue to do everything
possible to pull the Israeli army back to the international border
so that there would be quiet in the area.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria are apparently awaiting a visit to the region
by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright scheduled in early
September which is aimed at restarting the Israeli-Syrian talks
broke off three years ago.
</P>
<P>
The main issue in the talks will be the fate of the Golan
Heights, a Syrian strategic plateau seized by Israel in the 1967
Middle East war.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Receiving Message From U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Ministry on
Wednesday "categorically" denied a newspaper report that its
bitter enemy the U.S. has sent a message to Iran via Oman.
</P>
<P>
The official Islamic Republic News Agency reported that an
informed source at the ministry here rejected the report carried
by the English-language daily Tehran Times as "baseless."
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Wednesday quoted an unnamed Foreign Ministry
source as saying "this is the first time Washington sends its
message via Oman, while earlier it used to send all its messages
through Swiss Embassy, which takes care of U.S. interests in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Times said the message was probably related to regional
issues, but it did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. severed its diplomatic relations with Iran in 1980
after radical students took over the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and
took embassy staff hostage in the heydays of the Islamic
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
There have been improvements in the atmosphere between the two
arch-enemies since Mohammad Khatami, a moderate cleric, became
president two years ago. The most recent move by the U.S. is the
lifting of a ban on the sale of food and medicine to Iran.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Grants S. Africa Oil Marketing Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
granted South Africa the right for the first time to market 55,000
barrels of Nigerian crude oil daily.
</P>
<P>
The right to "lift", or act as a sales agent, granted to South
Africa, comes as part of a larger re-allocation of marketing
contracts by President Olusegun Obasanjo's new government, which
was attempting to stamp out the corruption plaguing the oil
industry, the Business Day newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Jackson Gaius-Obaseki, managing director of the Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation, began the shake-up Friday,
announcing the cancellation of 41 contracts to lift Nigerian
crude.
</P>
<P>
This was followed by the announcement this week of 16 new
marketers.
</P>
<P>
Gaius-Obaseki announced that apart from South Africa, the
National Oil Corporation of Kenya and Ghana National Oil
Corporation, and 13 other companies would have a year's contract
to lift a total of 865,000 barrels of Nigeria's crude daily.
</P>
<P>
This amount is just less than half of Nigeria's daily
production. The other half will be sold by the large oil companies
operating in Nigeria, which typically have 50-50 joint venture
partnerships with the Nigerian government agency.
</P>
<P>
South Africa tops the list of government-to-government deals.
Kenya and Ghana were each given an allocation of 30,000 barrels a
day.
</P>
<P>
Other companies granted marketing rights are well-known names
in the industry, including Glencore International of Switzerland,
Total of France, Kyokuto Petroleum of Japan and North Atlantic
Refinery of Canada.
</P>
<P>
However, a South African government spokesman expressed
surprise at the announcement, saying that South Africa was not
involved in tendering for the allocation.
</P>
<P>
Industry representatives said the right to market the oil could
 constitute a political statement by the Nigerian government aimed
at improving relations with South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Whether the contract would be lucrative depended very much on
its terms, the paper quoted industry sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, new
guidelines are to be introduced which require marketers to show a
commitment to Nigerian development.
</P>
<P>
The lifters are required to invest heavily in the restive oil
communities in Nigeria's troubled Niger delta.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is the world's sixth largest producer of crude oil and
Africa's largest. About 90 percent of its foreign exchange is
derived from crude oil.

<HEADLINE> China Attains Remarkable Progress in Economic Restructuring (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- China's economic structure has
undergone great changes and made a qualitative leap over the past
50 years since the founding of New China in 1949, according to the
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
</P>
<P>
An analytical report released here today by the NBS concerning
China's economic restructuring said that major changes in the
country's economic structure are centered on the upgrading of
industrialization and the rationalization of industries. By now
China has basically found out the right way to optimize its
economic structure.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, China has shifted from a traditional
agricultural nation to a developing country with a range of
comprehensive economic categories and initial industrialization.
</P>
<P>
In 1949, China's agricultural output value was 58.5 percent of
aggregate social output value, while industrial output value
accounted for only 30 percent in aggregate industrial and
agricultural output value. By 1998, the fixed assets value of the
country's state-owned industrial enterprises had increased to more
than three trillion yuan (360 billion US dollars) from 10.7
billion yuan (1.3 billion US dollars) in 1952.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 50 years, China's economic structure has shifted
from partially stressing industry to the all-round growth of all
three industries. Before the launching of opening up and reform
policies in the late 1970s, China's economic growth relied mainly
on the development of industry, especially heavy industry.  This
trend, however, has been altered in the past two decades, with
attention being attached to agriculture, light industry and the
tertiary industry.

<P>
China's opening and reform drive has eased restrictions on the
growth of the tertiary industry, boosting the development of
agricultural services, geological prospecting and water
conservancy management, finance and insurance, real estate, social
services, scientific research, comprehensive technological
services and other tertiary industrial sectors.
</P>
<P>
The internal structure of agriculture has also been readjusted
from solely stressing grain production to the overall development
of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery.
</P>
<P>
In 1978, crop planting business made up 80 percent in aggregate
agricultural output value, whereas forestry, animal husbandry and
fishery accounted merely for 3.4 percent, 15 percent and 1.6
percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
By 1998, the proportion of crop planting in agricultural output
value had fallen to 56.2 percent, while that of animal husbandry
and fishery had risen to 30.8 percent and 9.6 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Experts hold that after 20 years' opening and reform efforts,
the proportions of China's three major industries, light and heavy
industries as well as internal sectors of various industries, have
gradually been balanced.
</P>
<P>
The experts said that, judging from an overall point of view,
China's economic set-up has reversed the trend of disproportion
and initially completed industrial rationalization, entering a new
phase of structural upgrading and high-quality development.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Launches Health Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
launched a five- year national health sector and AIDS control
strategic plan with an objective to increase the longevity and
equality of Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Jackson Kalweo said here Tuesday that the
1999-2004 plan aims at reducing the prevalence of HIV/AIDS and
increase the level and quality of care for those already
infected, local media reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the plan was estimated to cost 84 billion shillings
(1.2 billion U.S. dollars), out of which 2.3 billion shillings
(32 million U.S. dollars) would go towards the HIV/ AIDS control
program.
</P>
<P>
Kalweo noted that with the expected resources, a financing gap
of 24 percent is anticipated, saying this will be financed
through additional resources from the Treasury, development
partners, private sector and the non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
The plan covers six priority areas: malaria prevention and
treatment; reproductive health; HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis
prevention and management; integrated management of childhood
illness and immunization; prevention and control of major
environmental health-related diseases; and food safety.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the plan would ensure equitable allocation
of government resources to reduce disparities in health, continue
to manage the population growth and create an environment for
private sector and community involvement in health service.

KAMPALA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Uganda People's Defense Forces
(UPDF) suffered some causalities in clashes with Rwandan troops in
Kisangani in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), a senior
army officer told Xinhua Wednesday morning.
</P>

Kahinda Otafiire, a Ugandan officer overseeing UPDF operations

<HEADLINE> Egyptians Fly to Sudan to Mediate Between </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has sent a delegation to
Sudan to help mediate between the government and opposition groups
to end the country's 16-year-old civil war, a national newspaper
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Arabic Al-Ahram daily said the Egyptian delegation flew
out of Cairo airport alongside a Libyan delegation to the Sudanese
capital of Khartoum Tuesday night in a joint effort to open
national reconciliation conference between the Sudanese government
and the opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
The pro-government paper quoted airport officials as saying
that the Egyptian delegation was headed by Assistant Foreign
Minister for the Sudanese Affairs Fouad Youssef. The Libyan
delegation was only described as "high-level."
</P>
<P>
The mission followed a five-day strategy meeting of Sudanese
opposition leaders in the Libyan capital of Tripoli that ended on
August 1. At the meeting, the Sudanese National Democratic
Alliance (NDA) agreed to accept Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi's
offer to mediate in Sudan's civil war.
</P>
<P>
The NDA groups northern Sudanese parties that are seeking
democracy and the Sudan People's Liberation Army, which seeks
autonomy for the Christian and animist people of the south.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has also been mediating between the two rival sides, with
Sudanese officials and opposition leaders coming regularly to
Cairo to meet Egyptian officials.
</P>
<P>
Sudan's war and related famine have claimed more than 1.9
million lives since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Congolese Rebels Ask Uganda for Reinforcements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, leader
of Uganda- backed rebel group based in Kisangani in the northeast
of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), has asked Uganda to
send in reinforcements in defense of the Congolese population.
</P>
<P>
Wamba made the appeal Tuesday after he was driven out of a
hotel in the city center, the New Vision newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Two battalions of his rebel force and Ugandan troops are
fighting four brigades of Rwandan troops, the rebel leader was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The elderly scholar-turned politician, who was ousted from the
leadership of the main rebel group, the Congolese Rally for
Democracy (RCD), in mid-May, fled his headquarters in Hotel
Wagenia in Kisangani and was hiding in an undisclosed location in
the city, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Half of his executive could have died in the hotel as half the
hotel was destroyed at dawn by Rwandan troops, according to the
rebel leader.
</P>
<P>
The division among RCD leadership led to the rebel group's
splitting into RCD-Goma backed by Rwanda and RCD-Kisangani
supported by Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said that Uganda is helping training new recruits
for Wamba as the military muscle of the RCD was mainly controlled
by RCD-Goma.
</P>
<P>
Kampala, however, has denied supporting any of the factions of
the split rebel group.

<HEADLINE> China to Develop Movie on American Voluntary Aerocade in World War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- American social activist Anna
Chan Chennault has reached an agreement with China to develop a
feature movie about her husband general Chennault in World War II.
</P>
<P>
The title of the movie is named after Chennault, who was the
commander of the US 14th Air Fleet during the second World War.
Anna Chen will interpret the homonymic role in the movie.
</P>
<P>
Claire Lee Chennault had organized American voluntary pilots
into an aerocade known as the Flying Tiger Fleet during the Second
World War. He and his men transported arms and other materials,
and joined in the air raid, supporting China against Japanese
invaders.
</P>
<P>
Many of the pilots were killed during the war and people are
still searching for their remains in China's mountainous regions.
</P>
<P>
The movie will reproduce the history and tell stories of the
members of the Flying Tiger Fleet and their offsprings, as well as
the love between Anna and her husband.
</P>
<P>
A Hollywood actor will play the leading role of the general.
</P>
<P>
The Overseas Chinese Artists Association of United States
assessed that the theme of the movie reflects a trans-national
humanistic significance.
</P>
<P>
The experience of the couple, a warrior in the past and an
envoy of peace at present, would bring people a far-reaching self-
reflection of the war launched by human in the 20th century, and
lead people to pray for the peace of the 21st century, the
association was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The director of the film is Qin Jian, who is famous for his
film "Huangpu Love". He has been invited to visit Western Europe
and the United States. In 1994, he developed a documentary for the
then European Community, which was the first practice for a
Chinese director.
</P>
<P>
Qin also directed the first film describing the warfield of
China, India and Burma in the Second World War. In 1998, another
film of his "the Chinese Crusaders" had been issued abroad in
several languages.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Population Reaches 19 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Australia's population has
reached 19 million but the nation's annual growth rate remains
among the lowest in the world, the Australian Bureau of Statistics
(ABS) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The figures of the ABS indicate it will take another six years
before the population hits 20 million.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the population milestone in Sydney, Minister for
Financial Services and Regulation Joe Hockey said "today,
Australia has just passed a population of 19 million."
</P>
<P>
"The 19-millionth person is likely to be a little girl born in
an Australian hospital."
</P>
<P>
He added that it had taken four years and five months for the
population to increase from 18 million to 19 million.
</P>
<P>
During that time, natural increase had accounted for 53 percent
of the growth and migration had contributed 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
The population increased by a net 558 a day - 681 babies were
born, 369 people died and 246 immigrants were added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China to Cut Sugar Output by 1.2 Million Tons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- China plans to cut sugar output
by 1.22 million tons next year in a bid to solve the oversupply
problem in the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed today by a source close to a national
conference on sugar production which ended recently in Kunming,
the provincial capital of Yunnan in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
According to the source, China's sugar production will be
reduced to 7.6 million tons for the next pressing season from 8.82
million tons for the 1998-99 pressing season.
</P>
<P>
The country will cut down sugarcane-growing acreage by 10
percent and reduce the sugar sector's economic losses by 1.5
billion yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which was jointly sponsored by the State
Economic and Trade Commission and the State Administration of
Light Industry, was attended by representatives from the country's
four key sugar producers -- Yunnan and Guangdong provinces and
Guangxi Zhuang and Xinjiang Uygur autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
China's current annual demand for sugar stands at seven million
tons, compared with this year's output of 8.82 million tons.
Falling sugar prices due to oversupply have caused sugar producers
heavy losses that added up to 8.26 billion yuan in the 1996-1998
period.
</P>
<P>
China has 17 sugarcane-growing provinces and autonomous regions
with 409 sugar mills. Guangxi, Yunnan, Guangdong and Xinjiang
account for 83 percent of the country's total sugar production.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the four leading sugar producers agreed to make
joint efforts to ensure the planned reduction of sugar production
by cutting their sugarcane-growing area by 143,000 hectares this
year, targeting at a reducing sugar output by one million tons in
the 1999-2000 season.
</P>
<P>
This, according to analysts, is expected to help stabilize the
sugar price at the Chinese market.

<HEADLINE> More New Zealand Women Have Late Childbearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The trend away from early
childbearing is continuing in New Zealand with the number of women
having a child in their teens or early 20s declining, according to
an official press release out here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the release, New Zealand's Deputy Government Statistician
Dianne Macaskill said the 30-34 year age group is now the second
commonest age group for childbearing.
</P>
<P>
"In the year to June 1999, 112 out of every 1,000 New Zealand
women aged 30-34 years gave birth, well up from 105 per 1,000 in
1991. The estimated average age of New Zealand women giving birth
is now 29.1 years, compared with 28.9 years in 1998 and 27.8 years
 in 1991," Macaskill said.
</P>
<P>
The estimated number of live births in the year totaled 56,843,
while deaths registered totaled 27,202 in New Zealand with a
population of 3.8 million.
</P>
<P>
Birth rates for the year suggest that New Zealand women average
1.97 births per woman, which is marginally below the level of 2.1
births per woman required for the population to replace itself
without migration, the deputy government statistician said.

<HEADLINE> India's Oil Import Up To 9.8 Billion U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 18 (Xinhua) -- With oil prices on the rise in
the international market, India is expected to pay 9.8 billion
U.S. dollars for its oil import bill during the current financial
year which ends in March 2000.
</P>
<P>
The import bill should be at least 30 percent higher than last
year's 7.5 billion U.S. dollars, 0.5 billion U.S. dollars more
than the all-time high of 9.32 billion dollars in 1996-97, the
Indian Express reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The country imported 57 million tons of crude oil and petroleum
products last year and paid 7.39 billion U.S. dollars for 53
million tons of oil a year before.
</P>
<P>
The fast soaring crude oil price coincides with a nearly 40
percent increase in its oil refining capacity, which has gone up
to 67 million tons with 15 refineries in the country.
</P>
<P>
Experts here believe that India's import bill could go up
further if crude oil and petroleum products continue to get dearer
at the present rate.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil prices have doubled since January, when the
prevailing rates were roughly 9 U.S. dollars a barrel, while
petroleum product prices have increased by more than 30 percent
since March, when crude prices turned the corner at 11 U.S.
dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
India has planned to increase its crude imports to nearly 60
million tons by the end of next March from roughly 38 million tons
last year while petroleum product imports would drop drastically
to half of last year's level with the increase in the indigenous
availability of diesel, kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas.

<HEADLINE> National Ethnic Games Opens on Auspicious Note </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- With the Ode of Good Luck
reverberating over the venue, the Sixth National Ethnic Games
opens in a folk way here, adding another note of jubilation to the
Tibet Autonomous Region (TAG) which was celebrating its 40th
anniversary of the Democratic Reform.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetans, who are for the first time to host such sport
gala of minority nationalities, has regarded the games as an
auspicious omen for the future development.
</P>
<P>
"The staging of such event will bring great boon to the whole
TAG, we have took it as a harbinger of a more promising future.
That is why we have put the ode to Good Luck as the theme of the
opening ceremony," said Dan Zen Gongbu, the general masterminder
for the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The TAG have witnessed substantial changes since 1959 when the
Democratic Reform was innovated, abolishing the system of
exploitation and separating religion from government.
</P>
<P>
About 1,200 children holding balloons flooded in the stadium
from all directions before they formed a shape of the five rings
of Olympics, raising the curtain of the grand ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The stands immediately turned into a sea of white Hada (Tibetan
's traditional silk stripe to show hospitality) as the spectators
flourished hundreds of thousands of Hada and formed a Mexico Wave.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan culture began to take center stage when the Tibetan
folk songs and dances, which has strong sense of rhythm, impressed
the whole spectators so much that even the locals could not but
reveal their surprises.
</P>
<P>
"It is the first spectacular scene I have ever seen, even we
locals haven't expected such depth of dances with strong flavor of
Tibetan culture," said Duoji Cairang, who works in the TAG
Theatrical Company. "it has become the town's talk since the
opening ceremony rehearsal was held three days in advance."
</P>
<P>
Against the blue sky and green grass, about 7,000 Tibetans from
the countryside and the grazing area, with a large variety of
hairstyles and dressings, danced to show their wishes for
beautiful life and express their happiness about harvest.
</P>
<P>
The folk songs were so impressive that the spectators were
brought back to ancient times when the Tibetans lived a simple
life on grazing and farming, then the rhythm became intense,
reminiscent of the scene when the locals struggled with natural
hardship for better livelihood, before it became light and quick,
showing a picture of Tibetans enjoying their happy lives.
</P>
<P>
Xiangbala (the Utopia of the Tibetans) Is Not Remote was the
song which touched the heartstrings of the whole stadium as the
local famous singer Dege Medo toured the stadium on a Mercedes-
benz car to push the opening ceremony to a new high.
</P>
<P>
The diversity of the performances also impressed the foreign
visitors deeply. Adriana Williams, together with her other six
fellows, has come to the Tibet Plateau for the second time and
they heaped their praises on the ceremony and the TAG.
</P>
<P>
"We came here both for sightseeing and having a look at the
national ethnic games," said Williams who came from California of
the United States. "The performances are really wonderful,
fantastic."
</P>
<P>
"The livelihood here is getting better and better, and in the
west we have often been told all is bad here, but after we came
here, it is not really that way, it is not all bad."

A strong aftershock measuring 4.8 degrees on the Richter scale
was felt in Cyprus Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday's quake, measuring 5.8 degrees, caused dozens of
injuries and damaged many buildings, especially in Cyprus'
southern coastal Limassol area where the epicenter was located.
</P>
<P>
The quake was followed by dozens of aftershocks, many of them
strong enough to be felt in Limassol and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
But local seismologists believe that seismic activity in the
Cyprus area is coming to the end of a ten-year active cycle and
would peter out in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
"These aftershocks were now waning," said Sotiris Aphrodisis,
the acting head of Cyprus' Geological Survey Department.
</P>
<P>
In February 1995, two people were killed when an earthquake
with a magnitude of 5.7 degrees jolted Cyprus' western Paphos
area. In October 1996, a 6.3-degree quake caused minor damages but
no fatalities on the island.
</P>
<P>
The news of the huge quake in Turkey, which has so far killed
more than 2,500 people and injured tens of thousands, raised fears
that a similar catastrophe might be round the corner for Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Journalist Freed After Agreeing to Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- An opposition Egyptian journalist
has been released after agreeing to pay a fine of 20,000 Egyptian
pounds (5,900 U.S. dollars) imposed by a court for libeling
Egypt's deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported on Wednesday that Adel
Hussein, a columnist for the Islamist Al-Shaab newspaper, the
fiery mouthpiece of the opposition Labor Party, was set free on
Monday after he agreed to pay the fine in instalments, a
compromise reached with the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
Hussein, who is also deputy chairman of the Labor Party, was
arrested Monday and detained for eight hours for refusing to pay
the fine immediately in protest against the court sentence, the
English-language newspaper quoted security sources as saying on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The South Cairo Criminal Court on Saturday convicted Hussein
and three other Al-Shaab journalists of libeling Deputy Prime
Minister Youssef Wali in a series of articles and cartoons that
accused him of "treason" and "working as an agent for" Israel and
trying to ruin Egypt's economy.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the same amount of fines, the other three
journalists were sentenced to two years in prison with hard labor,
the maximum allowed under a 1996 press law.
</P>
<P>
Wali, who is also the minister of agriculture, has signed a
number of agreements with Israel for the supply of seed,
fertilizers and technology to arrest desertification.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shaab is published by the Labor Party, which is allied to
the Muslim Brotherhood - Egypt's strongest Islamic movement - and
opposes peace with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Egyptian Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Egyptian newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt has renewed its call for an international
anti-terrorism conference under the sponsorship of the U.N. and to
coordinate national and international efforts to counter the
threat.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Foreign Minister for International Affairs Sayed
Kassem said Egypt would assert its unwavering stance on the
necessity of pooling international efforts to combat terrorism
during its statement at the new U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Al-Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Minister of Public Works and Water Resources Mahmoud Abu
Zeid flatly denied that Egypt has any intention to supply Israel
with Nile water via al-Salam canal.
</P>
<P>
He added that the water concerns of the Nile basin countries
are not part of the water problems in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He explained that international agreements prevent any of the
basin countries to supply other countries outside the basin with
Nile water, adding that the political leadership in Egypt is
committed to these pacts.
</P>
<P>
Al-Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Sudan's Ambassador in Egypt Ahmed Abdel Halim said Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir have
agreed to restore normal relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He also thanked Egypt and Libya for their continuing interest
in mediating national conciliation in Sudan, adding that the
efforts exerted by Cairo and Tripoli can jointly expedite the
process.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- Statistics prepared by the Ministry of Industry revealed
that the number of the unlicensed small workshops found in the
basements of old houses are increasing despite the tough measures
imposed by the authorities of four ministers to regulate their
work and turn them into healthy productive units.
</P>
<P>
The official report showed that of a total of 280,000
productive units, only 20,000 are legally registered at the
Ministry of Industry. And the other 260,000 mobile productive
units under the name "micro" are not registered and are
uncontrolled by the concerned authority.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's
ambassador-at-large S.R. Nathan Wednesday was declared the
country's second elected president.
</P>
<P>
As the sole candidate declared by the Presidential Elections
Committee (PEC) eligible for the elections, Nathan met with no
rivals and thus became the president-elect automatically.
</P>
<P>
Nathan, the island country's sixth president and the second
elected president, will begin his term on September 1.
</P>
<P>
Ong Teng Cheong is the first elected president after Singapore
adopted the new presidential system in 1993. His term will end on
August 31.
</P>
<P>
In his first speech after being declared the president elect,
Nathan said he was "humbled and very moved" by this honor to be
the new president.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed appreciation to all who have supported him in
his presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Nathan presented his nomination papers
after nominations for the presidential election opened on the
morning of Wednesday, the Nomination Day.
</P>
<P>
Nathan, a veteran civil servant and Chairman of the Institute
of Defense and Strategic Studies, received a Certificate of
Eligibility (COE) from the PEC on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The other two unsuccessful applicants, private tutor Ooi Boon
Ewe and insurance agent Tan Soon Phuan, were rejected by the PEC
on reasons that they did not meet all the requirements for the
issue of COE.

<P>
NEW DELHI, August 18 (Xinhua) -- India's tea production dropped
by 19 percent in the first half of 1999 to 261.2 million kilograms
against 322.1 million kg recorded a year ago, according to the
United Planters Association of South India (UPASI) .

<P>
In the northeast, production decreased to 167.6 million kg
during January-June this year against 219 million kg recorded a
year ago.

WASHINGTON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The first Goodwill Winter
Games will be held in Lake Placid, New York, from February 17 to
20, according to a local report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Lake Placid has staged the 1932 and 1980 Winter Olympics, but

Among the improvements is a state-of-art luge, bobsled and
skeleton track slated to open in December. The upgrades and Lake
Placid's Olympic legacy helped convince Turner Broadcasting to
come to upstate New York for the first winter Goodwill Games.
</P>
<P>
The Summer Goodwill Games have been held four times. The Turner
formula invites world class athletes in a final-one format for
prize money. Training takes place on February 15.

feature Alpine, cross-country and freestyle skiing, figure skating,
Nordic combined, short-track speedskating, ski jumping and
snowboarding.

<HEADLINE> Japan Lobbies Thailand on WTO Farm Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Agriculture Minister
Shoichi Nakagawa has lobbied Thailand to take a sympathetic stance
with Japan on agricultural issues at the upcoming round of World
Trade Organization (WTO) talks.
</P>
<P>
The Nation, a leading English newspaper here, reported
Wednesday that Nakagawa discussed the issue in Bangkok with Thai
Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi who will succeed Mike
Moore of New Zealand as the director-general of the WTO in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the Japanese government has urged Thailand to
take into consideration that agricultural trade should not be
considered purely as a commercial activity. Other aspects
including food security and the balance of supply and demand in
farm exporting countries should also be considered, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
WTO members are set to meet in Seattle, the United States, in
December this year to prepare for the next round of trade
negotiations. The U.S. officials had earlier said that the U.S.
administration would place a high priority on opening up the world
farm trade.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government, strongly pressured by domestic
farmers, has, however, been trying to protect them by limiting
access to the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
In a written proposal on the upcoming WTO negotiation which
will be presented to Thai officials, the Japanese government said
that members should allow for a smooth implementation of domestic
agriculture policies and the differences in national conditions.
</P>
<P>
Regarding food security, Japan said consideration should be
given to this aspect of agriculture by taking into account the
instability of food supply and demand in the international market.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the members should also redress the imbalances in
rights and obligations under the WTO rules between exporting and
importing countries.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this, the members should strengthen the existing
rules and disciplines on export restrictions with a view to
redressing rights and obligations between exporting and importing
countries.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Bans "Two China" Activities in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun
Sen signed a government decree Wednesday banning government and
military officials at all levels from taking part in any
activities held by Taiwan separatists in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The decree was aimed at the recent reports that some Taiwanese
elements attempt to mark Taiwan's so-called "National Day" on
October 10 in Cambodia and illegally use Taiwan's "flag" and
"anthem".
</P>
<P>
The government announcement pointed out that the aim of the
activity is to pursue a "two China" policy and to reopen the
Taiwan office in Cambodia which was forced to close in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the above-mentioned facts, the Royal Government of
Cambodia reiterates that Cambodia always pursues 'one China'
policy and recognizes Taiwan as an integral part of the People's
Republic of China," the decree said.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan issue is the internal affair of China. Any attempt to
admit Taiwan as an independent country is not only a brutal
violation of the sovereignty of the People's Republic of China,
but also a blasphemy against King Norodom Sihanouk as well as a
violation of the principle of the Kingdom of Cambodia," it
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The decree urged various government departments and the
officials in various cities and provinces to take every measure to
ban such illegal activity held by Taiwanese.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador, Colombia Urged to Settle Trade Dispute in WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, August 17 (Xinhua) -- An official of the Andean Nations
Community (CAN) proposed Tuesday that Ecuador and Colombia look
for a solution to their trade dispute from the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Colombia imposed tighter import controls on Ecuadorian fruit
products last week, banning the entrance of several varieties on
sanitary ground. The affected products include banana, lemon,
avocado, mango, pineapple, dry coconut, raspberry, papaya and
strawberry.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Ecuadorian Service of Agricultural Sanitation,
Emilio Raymond, said that his country has exhausted all means in
seeking an end to the trade dispute.
</P>
<P>
Michael Badolla, responsible for the CAN's Andean Agricultural
Sanitation Project, said that although Ecuador and Colombia are
both CAN members, they do not follow the bloc's rules. Therefore
the most obvious path to find a solution is to go to the WTO, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The CAN is made up of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and
Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of this year, Ecuadorian fruit exports
to Colombia reached almost 1.7 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> China Pours Huge Funds into Anti-Flood Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to its all-out nationwide
water conservancy construction, China has suffered less losses
from flooding this year despite higher water levels in some parts
of the Yangtze, the major flooding river, than in last year's
catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
Gao Juncai, a senior official with the State Development
Planning Commission (SDPC), said the government has invested
heavily in water conservancy projects since 1998.
</P>
<P>
Total investment during this period hit 63 billion yuan (7.6
billion US dollars), of which 46.5 billion yuan (5.6 billion US
dollars) came from the issuance of treasury bonds. Taking into
account loans from World bank and foreign governments, the sum
will amount to 100 billion (12 billion US dollars), three times
the 1995-1997 figure.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June this year, embankments along the Yangtze and
Yellow rivers and Dongting, Poyang and Taihu lakes and other
rivers and lakes measuring a total of 6,200 km have been
reinforced, and 4.6 million tons of silt from river beds have been
removed.
</P>
<P>
Experts spoke highly of these projects, saying that they have
reduced the risks for accidents and losses remarkably during this
year's flooding season.
</P>
<P>
The August figures showed that the people affected by
floodwater this year was only 58.8 percent of the flood victims
last year, with casualties standing still lower at 28.8 percent,
in spite of the high water levels on the Yangtze's middle and
lower reaches. Meanwhile, direct economic losses were cut by 63.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, there were fewer accidents in most flood-
ravaged regions, with water levels even higher than that of last
year in some of its places, Gao said.
</P>
<P>
The government has also appropriated adequate funding to key
water control projects, including the Xiaolangdi project on the
Yellow river, to the renovation of water detention reservoirs, and
to water-soil conservation projects on the upper reaches of the
Yangtze and the Yellow river.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a 3.5-billion-yuan investment on a relocation
project involving the participation of one million people has
already paid off, as the flood victims of last year have settled
down while a combined area of 1,500-sq-km land has been turned
into lakes for floodwater absorption.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chinese government's anti-flood blueprint,
embankments along the Yangtze will be able to fend off any
possible full-scale deluges in 10 years' time.

<P>
TIANJIN, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin Municipality's exports
and imports reached 7.04 billion U.S. dollars in the first seven
months of this year, representing a year-on-year increase of 22.5
percent, according to statistics released by the General
Administration of Customs.
</P>
<P>
A breakdown shows that exports rose 22.7 percent to 3.59
billion dollars and imports grew 22.2 percent to 3.45 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Local economists say the increase indicates that foreign trade
in this northern China major port city is recovering from the
shadow of an economic crisis that hit most southeast Asian
countries since 1997.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that of the total exports Tianjin handled in
the seven-month period, state-owned enterprises accounted for 971
million dollars, up 25 percent, while solely foreign-funded
enterprises accounted for 1.56 billion dollars, up 23.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Exports of garments, machinery and electronics, and furniture
all increased by a big margin in the January-July period.
Furniture exports, mainly to European countries and the United
States, reached 138 million dollars, up over 50 percent from a
year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Expects 4 Million Tourists by Year 2004 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Ministry of
Tourism is seeking to promote regional tourism to meet its target
of 4 million tourist arrivals by the year 2004, press reports said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
To improve tourism figures, Sri Lanka is preparing to meet the
needs of the diverse range of visitors by responding to market
trends and meet the requirements of discerning and sophisticated
visitors, the Island reported.
</P>
<P>
Emphasis will be given to regional tourism, the delivery of the
best practice service standards and enhancing the industry's
information base.
</P>
<P>
Many of Sri Lanka's prominent tourist attractions are found in
regional areas and many niche markets such as ecotourism, rural
tourism, indigenous tourism, backpacking and adventure tourism
have their focus in regional Sri Lanka, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, Sri Lanka will seek to encourage tourists to
travel beyond the boundaries of traditional metropolitan gateways
to regional areas.
</P>
<P>
The government will also direct its attention at enhancing
community awareness and involvement in the industry to ensure the
sustainable development of the tourist industry.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, tourists arrivals to Sri Lanka rose by 4.1 percent to
381,063 over the previous year. Earnings last year reached 200
million U.S. dollars, making tourism the third largest foreign
exchange source for the country.
</P>
<P>
The Tourist Board has predicted a 17 percent rise in tourist
arrivals this year to 446,000. Tourist arrivals for the first half
of 1999 rose to 212,766, up nearly 23 percent over the same period
last year.

approaching 90 percent in the first half of this year, according
to the State Administration of Building Materials Industry.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- China's Supreme People's Court (
SPC) said Tuesday that local courts had executed forcible
enforcement of rulings on five cases that had been long delayed,
local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The move shows the SPC's strong its determination to tackle the
widespread practices of interference and resistance to enforcement
of court rulings, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Such interference and resistance were rooted in local and
departmental protectionism, according to Li Guoguang, vice-
president of the SPC.
</P>
<P>
All the courts in the country will make full use of all the
compulsory measures permitted by the law to carry out court
rulings, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that those who illegally meddle in the execution of
the cases will be held legally responsible, thus ensuring that
court rulings are effectively administered.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that up to the end of June, more than 850,
000 court rulings, involving 259 billion yuan (about 31.2 billion
U.S. dollars), were yet to be executed.
</P>
<P>
The five cases of forcible enforcement took place in Guangdong,
Henan, Jilin and Jiangxi provinces and Beijing, in which four
people were under judicial detention or arrest now.
</P>
<P>
An intensive campaign against the difficulties in executing
court rulings, a plague that has long worried the Chinese courts,
was carried out in the last four months of last year.

<HEADLINE> Timberwolves Agree to Terms with Forward Joe Smith </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Joe Smith, the top overall
selection in the 1995 draft who was rejuvenated by a new
environment last season, today agreed to terms to remain with the
Minnesota Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
Specifics of the deal were undisclosed. Smith's agent, Eric
Fleisher, who also represents Timberwolves superstar forward Kevin
Garnett, was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
The Wolves also re-signed forward Tom Hammonds to an
undisclosed deal. The ninth overall pick in the 1989 draft
averaged 4.3 points and 2.8 rebounds last season, his second with
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
Smith, 225 pounds, took the place of former All-Star Tom
Gugliotta last season, joining his third team in four years by
signing as a free agent. He teamed with Garnett for 149 blocked
shots in the lockout-abbreviated campaign.
</P>
<P>
"Joe and KG really complement each other and give us two of the
best shot-blocking forwards in the game today," Timberwolves
general manager and coach Flip Saunders said.
</P>
<P>
Smith, 24, averaged a career-low 13.7 points and 8.2 rebounds
in 43 games last season. Those numbers dropped to 7.5 and 6.5 in
four postseason games as Minnesota fell to the eventual champion
San Antonio Spurs in the first round. His scoring has dropped off
each of the last three years.
</P>
<P>
"We are extremely excited to re-sign Joe," Saunders said. "He
was able to re-establish himself in the shortened season last year
and we look for him to continue to grow with us."
</P>
<P>
Smith earned All-Rookie First Team honors after leaving
university. He averaged 15.3 points and 8.7 rebounds in 82 games.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Economy Grows Solidly in First Half Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's economy grew
steadily in the first half of this year with its Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) up 2.5 percent over the same period in 1998, said a
report from the finance secretary's office on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the GDP jumped by 3.2 percent from April to
June due to the "dynamism of the industrial sector," which grew by
4.4 percent, followed by the service and agricultural sectors,
which advanced by 2.9 and 2.2 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Within the industrial sector, the construction activity
rocketed by 5.7 percent, followed by the manufacturing and
electrical generating, gas and water sectors with 4.9 percent
together.
</P>
<P>
Mining production registered a steep fall of 6.4 percent, said
the official report.
</P>
<P>
Mexico, the only major economy in Latin America to post solid
growth this year, has set the goal for the whole year at a 3.0
percent growth of its GDP, 13 percent in inflation and 1.25
percent in public deficit.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predict the 2.5 percent growth in GDP in the first
half of the year would put the economy on track to meet or even
exceed the government target for the year.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Mexican exports increased 10 percent to 64
billion U.S. dollars during the mentioned period, despite a strong
peso, the country's currency, which made goods less competitive in
price.
</P>
<P>
Some economists attribute the hike to a robust U.S. economy,
because about 80 percent of Mexican exports go to its northern
neighbor.

of 30 experts and 12 sniffer dogs to help search and rescue people
still buried in the ruins.
</P>
<P>
A six-member special rescue team left Hungary on Tuesday
afternoon for the quake-stricken areas in Turkey. The team, made
up of medical and technical workers, brought along two sniffer
dogs in addition to specialized equipment to locate those trapped
in the rubble.
</P>
<P>
Austria said it would send 60 special technical troops to the
disaster areas on Tuesday night to assist the search and rescue
efforts in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic promised to send heavy digging machinery and
specially trained dogs to help look for survivors. Other aid
programs are being under emergency negotiations, a Czech foreign
ministry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian government has committed to send as early as
Tuesday night a team of rescuers and sniffer dogs provided by the
Bulgarian Red Cross to the quake-hit areas in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The quake, measuring 6.8 on the Richter scale, struck Izmit, a
northwestern industrial city about 90 kilometers east of Turkey's
largest city, Istanbul, at 3:02 a.m. local time (0020 GMT). Most
of the dead were crushed in their sleep.
</P>
<P>
As many as 10,000 people are feared still trapped in the rubble
around Golcuk, a navy base town about 130 kilometers southeast of
Istanbul. Thousands more were missing in Istanbul and elsewhere.
The power supply has been cut off in the disaster areas.
</P>
<P>
The overall death toll by late Tuesday, according to the semi-
official Anatolia news agency, was at 2,011 and the injuries
totaled 10,764.
</P>
<P>
Israel, Germany, Japan and Greece have also pledged to provide
aid to the quake-devastated Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Mexico's Tourism Revenue Surpasses Petroleum Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Mexico received 20 million
overseas visitors and its tourism revenue reached 8 billion U.S.
dollars in 1998, surpassing that of petroleum exports for the
first time, Mexico's Secretary of Tourism Oscar Espinosa said on
Tuesday in Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, Espinosa also revealed
Mexico's tourism industry now represents 8.2 percent of its GDP
and creates 1.7 million jobs.
</P>
<P>
Mexico is the seventh most attractive tourism destination and
the 13th in tourism revenue of the world, Espinosa added.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is fundamental for the development of Latin American
countries, he said, because it can efficiently abate the economic
and social problems brought by the fast growing population.
</P>
<P>
He said Mexico is planning to improve its tourism
infrastructure, noting that by the end of 2000, 160 projects, at 6
billion dollars, will be added in 26 of the country's 31 states.
</P>
<P>
These projects will include hotels, restaurants, golf courses
and beach resorts, he added.
</P>
<P>
Guatemala is the third stop of Espinosa's promotional visit in
the tourist corridor dominated by the Maya World in Central
America after Honduras and Belize. His visit will conclude on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Espinosa will attend a ministerial meeting over
the multi-national program of the Maya World in Belize.

<HEADLINE> Divorce Rate Reaches New High in Czech Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic has one of the
highest divorce rates in the world, according to official
statistics released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The divorce rate reached 58.8 percent last year, the highest in
the country's history and up by 20.2 percent compared with a
decade ago, the State Statistical Bureau said.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, 55,027 couples were married and 32,363 couples were
divorced. The population of the Czech Republic in the same year
was 10,289,600.
</P>
<P>
Czech experts say that in addition to personal trauma suffered
by divorced couples and their children, a high divorce rate also
affects the country's social stability.
</P>
<P>
The Czech authorities issued a new marriage law last August,
making it more difficult to divorce. In the fourth quarter last
year, 4,715 Czech couples were divorced, half the number in the
previous quarter.

MEXICO CITY, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's international
reserves declined by 464 million U.S. dollars in the week of
August 6-13, the Central Bank said in a statement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank attributed the strong decline to operational
expenses incurred by the Federal Government and the State
Petroleum Company in their current foreign currency accounts.
</P>
<P>
The present level of the country's foreign reserves, around 30.
76 billion dollars, stands as one of the highest in recent months

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Sweet Corn Processing Line into Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The largest sweet corn
processing line in China has been put into production at the
Xinzhou Economic Development Zone, in north China's Shanxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
The factory, with a total investment of 19.88 million yuan (
about 2.4 million US dollars) from a catering development company
in Shanxi, occupies an area of 10,000 sq m. Its key machinery has
been designed and manufactured by well-known machinery producers
in Germany and Japan, as well as China.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that the factory has now become the largest
sweet corn processor with the most advanced technology in China.
Its main products include vacuum-packed, quick-frozen fresh sweet
corn ears and quick-frozen sweet corn. And the annual output of
the vacuum-packed products is expected to reach 10 million, with a
sales volume worth 37.19 million yuan and yielding taxes of 9.37
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Xinzhou is a major corn-producing area in the province. The
sowing area for corn has been expanding with the restructuring of
the rural economy. The local sweet corn features high nutrition,
good taste and high protein due to the peculiar climate and other
natural conditions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local officials said that the area will try to raise
the added value of agricultural products by making good use of its
advantages in natural resources.

<HEADLINE> Art Market Flourishes in Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, China's largest port
city in the north, has witnessed a fast growing market of art
works in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In the 15-year-old Ancient Culture Street in the downtown area,
the 80 art stores and departments reported a total retail revenue
of nearly 24 million yuan in 1998 alone.
</P>
<P>
All around Tianjin are shops selling inscriptions, oil
paintings, porcelain, pottery, jade objects, sculptures and many
other rare articles.
</P>
<P>
Inscriptions and paintings by renowned calligraphers and
artists, and refined art works from other provinces, as well as
jade articles imported from Pakistan, are sold exclusively in many
newly-built stores in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Seven local artists have opened their own studios to paint and
draw pictures according to the demands of the customers.
</P>
<P>
To stimulate the art market and to attract more collectors and
buyers, Tianjin hosts art auctions periodically.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that sustained economic development is the main
reason behind the prosperity of the art market.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin's local specialties are new year pictures, red paper-
cuts, painted sculptures and clay figurines.
</P>
<P>
Sun Jianshan, who has run an art works business for many years,
said that though Tianjin has a fine artistic tradition, people
used to prefer to spend their money in restaurants. But now they
are turning to art works.
</P>
<P>
Sun's store is one of the most profitable of such stores in
Tianjin. He said the development of the market is still at the
primary stage, but it will be more flourishing in the future.

<P>
CHONGQING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- This municipality in southwest
China has drawn up a 50-year construction program to improve its
ecological environment, local officials said today.
</P>
<P>
In line with the program, Chongqing, an old industrial city
which consumes a great amount of high-sulfur coal, will increase
its forest coverage rate from the present 21 percent to 45 percent
by the year 2050, and its nature reserve area will account for 10
percent of its total area.
</P>
<P>
By then, the city's area afflicted by water and soil erosion,
which accounts for half of the city's total area, will be brought
under control.
</P>
<P>
The project is estimated to cost 58.6 billion yuan (about seven
billion U.S. dollars), with half of the funds coming from the
central government, and the rest to be raised by issuing shares
and bonds, and attracting foreign funds.

<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, August 18 (Xinhua) -- A first-aid network, composed of
a first-aid center, four branches and 13 main hospitals, has been
recently set up in this open coastal city in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Sun Chengdai, head of the city Bureau of Health, said that the
center will first record all the "120" callings for medical help,
and then select the nearest branch for the assignment, ensuring
that emergency patients get first aid within 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 13 main hospitals will take charge of the
hospitalization of the patients, and improve the first-aid service
by simplifying procedures.
</P>
<P>
The first-aid center has 30 ambulances of various kinds,
including ones for special services, such as for patients with
infectious diseases. Three of them have pacemaker
electrotherapeutic apparatus, and 22 have electrocardiographs and
oxygen inhalators.
</P>
<P>
The network will increase the annual first-aid capacity to some
300,000 patients, and hospitalize three million patients in
critical conditions.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China as a whole can only offer first-aid
service to less than one percent of emergency patients, and over
70 percent of patients with cardiovascular, cerebral, or
respiratory system diseases die on the way to hospital.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, Shanghai, and Dalian have been making continuous
efforts for the improvement of first-aid services for the last 20
years, and the newly-established system in Dalian has been
recognized by the Ministry of Health as a model in this regard.

<HEADLINE> Rules on Foreign Students Studying in China Mapped Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Education has
drafted a regulation offering guidelines for primary and middle
schools enrolling foreign children who wish to study in China.
</P>
<P>
Primary and middle schools, with approval from provincial-level
education, foreign affairs and public security departments, can
enroll foreign students who are living in China with their parents
on a long-term basis, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Foreign children living temporarily in the country must find
Chinese or resident foreigners to act as their guardians if they
want to enter primary or middle schools in China.
</P>
<P>
The regulation also pointed out that students who intend to
study for over six months in China should submit their visa
applications and school admission notices to Chinese embassies or
consulates to obtain an "X" visa.
</P>
<P>
"They must apply for residence permits from the exit and entry
administrations of local public security departments within 30
days since they enter China," Ministry sources were quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Those studying for less than six months must apply for "F"
visas from Chinese embassies or consulates.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign students should live with their parents or guardians.
Well-equipped schools can provide foreign students with
dormitories after they receive approval from the authorities," the
sources told.
</P>
<P>
Regional education and pricing departments will decide how much
the schools should charge the foreign students.
</P>
<P>
Schools will not open extra courses for foreign students,
except for Chinese language classes. Foreign students can take
part in activities organized by the schools, but are exempt from
politics and ethics courses.
</P>
<P>
Students will be granted certificates if they pass appropriate
examinations.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Sports Council Chairman Ready to Take Blame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Sports Council (KONI)
Chairman Wismoyo Arismunandar said he is ready to be held
responsible for the country's failure to become kingpins in the
newly concluded 20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games.
</P>
<P>
"As the highest ranking official in sports, I'm responsible for
what we've accomplished in Brunei," he said during the ceremony
held to commemorate the 54th Indonesian Independence Day here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are indeed disappointed over the result, where for the
first time in over 22 years, we only managed to end in third place.
But, blaming each other and looking for a scapegoat will not do us
any good. Let's accept it brave-heartedly and evaluate what has
gone wrong in the campaign," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia went through a bad spell in Brunei only managing to
amass 44 golds to finish third behind Thailand and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
However, Wismoyo praised the athletes for what they had done in
fulfilling their deeds to the country.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the bad outcome, I think all athletes have given their
best to the country and I thank them for that," he was quoted by
The Indonesian Observer Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia had set a target to win at least 60 golds in the
proceedings, but they failed to anticipate the progress made by
rivals and had to settle with the worst scenario of being
surpassed by Malaysia.

"There are a variety of (intelligence) collection assets that
we will have at sea and in the air. And General Shelton felt that
those were adequate and that the THAAD radar was not going to be
necessary," Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
The radar is part of an advanced system designed to be used in
a planned U.S. missile defense. Although the United States would
not use the radar to monitor possible launch of the DPRK's
missile, it was planned for use in the coming months, Bacon said,
but declining to elaborate.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Industrial Production Rises 0.7 Percent in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve said
Tuesday that industrial output rose 0.7 percent in July, the
biggest increase in four months.
</P>
<P>
The Fed said the 0.7 percent advance in output at factories,
mines and utilities followed lackluster gains of 0.1 percent in
June and 0.2 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing output jumped 0.6 percent in July, the strongest
advance since October. Analysts believe that U.S. factories, hard
hit by the loss of export markets, are beginning to recover.
</P>
<P>
The pickup in output, which reflected a weather-related
increase in output at utility plants, pushed the overall operating
rate up to 80.7 percent of capacity in July. This is still far
below the level at which analysts begin to worry about production
bottlenecks.

<HEADLINE> 2-2 Draw for Mandela Farewell Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 17 (Xinhua) -- No results could have been
better than a 2-2 draw for the Mandela farewell match between the
African XI and the Fifa World XI Tuesday night in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
It was evident from the start of this encounter that both teams
were determined to not only showcase their skills, but entertain
the fans and more so the former South African President, Nelson
Mandela, as the nation bade him farewell.
</P>
<P>
The first 45 minutes was as entertaining as it was revealing,
but the game changed dramatically at the second half. The African
XI broke the ice when South Africa's Phil Masinga swept down the
right flank, cut in and sent in an inviting cross and Zambia's
Kalusha Bwalya scored a brilliant goal in the 51st minute.
</P>
<P>
The African XI barely had enough time to celebrate their lead
as Germany's Thomas Haessler within a minute scored an equalizer
after two beautiful crosses from his World XI colleagues.
</P>
<P>
The World stars gained the upper hand in the 65th minute when
Haessler's pass found Lubomir Moravcik of Slovakia who rifled it
past the African XI's goalkeeper, South Africa's Brian Baloyi.
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic movement came at the end of the game when the
African XI won a free kick in the 92nd minute and Bwalya scored
his second goal.
</P>
<P>
Before the match Mandela shook hands and chatted with the
players.

</P>
<P>
ZAGREB, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia is undisputably the
biggest winner at the 2nd Military World Games here while China
doubled its gold medals as compared to last edition.
</P>
<P>
Russia snatched 45 gold medals to atop the medals tally while
China was second with 29 golds, 21 silvers and 15 bronzes in these
games organized by the International Military Sports Council (CISM)
.
</P>
<P>
The Russians were the competitors to be reckoned with in almost
every sport and had extra strength in combat sports such as judo,
wrestling and boxing, and swimming.
</P>
<P>
China, third placer on medals table with 13 golds at last games
in Rome, moved one place up to be the runner-up. Italy dropped to
the third place from second, finishing with 17 golds here.
</P>
<P>
China dominated the women's events in swimming, winning six
golds, seven silvers and one bronze.
</P>
<P>
Qi Hui became the most decorated swimmer by pocketing three
golds and one silver.
</P>
<P>
At least 20 CISM world records fell here, including two from
the battlefield of the military pentathlon.
</P>
<P>
Han Hye Gyong of DPR Korea broke the world record for the women
's obstacle running while her compatriot Myong Gum Sun shattered
grenade throwing mark.
</P>
<P>
Both previous records were set by the defending champions China,
who were dethroned here by DPR Korea in both the individual and
the team competition.
</P>
<P>
But China saved its face by winning the women's relay event
while its men retained individual and team titles.
</P>
<P>
This second edition of the Military World Games was no doubt a
boost of confidence for the International Military Sports Council
(CISM), which had not hosted a multi-sport event before 1995.
</P>
<P>
"The success at these games is an important step forward after
the start of the major sports event in Rome four years ago," said
CISM President Gianni Gola.

<P>
NEW YORK, August 17 (Xinhua) -- A late-day rally pushed Wall
Street stocks higher in the third straight session Tuesday as a
consumer prices report raised hope that the Federal Reserve will
take a moderate action in raising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 70.29 at 11,117.08.
The blue chip index rose 257.40 points in the two previous
sessions.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose 13.39 at 1,344.16. The technology heavy
Nasdaq index rose 25.94 at 2,671.22.
</P>
<P>
The market rallied after the Labor Department reported that the
Consumer Price Index rose 0.3 percent in July, indicating little
pressure on inflation. The new data made investors believe that
the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates only modestly.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve raised the short-term interest rates on
June 30 and three weeks later, its chairman Alan Greenspan warned
the market of another rate hike if the new data signaled
inflationary pressures. Greenspan's warning has pushed stocks
lower.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index rose 5.82 at 628.71 and the Russell
2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.18 at 436.00. But the
American Stock Exchange index fell 1.09 at 778.41.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-5 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,844 up, 1,147 down and 542

Croatian and Serbian nationalist leaders, the Times reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, Rubin told a regular briefing that he could not agree
with the details of the story.
</P>
<P>
"What I'm saying... is that with respect to some of the details
about the American assistance, one would get the impression that
all of America's money was stolen, from reading that article, and
that is not correct," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reported that the anti-fraud unit, set up by the
Office of the High Representative, has exposed so much corruption
that relief agencies and embassies are reluctant to publicize the
thefts for fear of frightening away international donors.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said it obtained a report by the unit that names
several officials with ties to the governing nationalist parties,
accusing them of profiting from the fraud.
</P>
<P>
Although 15 officials have been dismissed by the High
Representative or have been blocked from holding office, most
retain authority, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"Organizations as diverse at the Office of the High
Representative, the United Nations and the United States Agency
for International Development, all dedicated to rebuilding the
country, have lost tens of millions of dollars," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report, which has not been made public, cites one incident
in which 10 foreign embassies and international aid agencies lost
more than 20 million U.S. dollars deposited in a Bosnian bank,
according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The unit is investigating 220 cases of alleged fraud and
corruption, it added. The funds were meant to help rebuild
Bosnia's roads, buildings and schools and to provide municipal
services in towns across the country.
</P>
<P>
However, Rubin denied the knowledge of the report. "To the best
of our knowledge as of 1:00 today... there is no 4,000-page report
documenting 220 cases of fraud and corruption," the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
"There are some documents that were compiled by the anti-fraud
unit, proving that a local official in Tuzla was responsible for
abuse," he added.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported that Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian
president, along with other senior nationalist leaders, has
dismissed the allegations of official corruption made by the
international investigators.
</P>
<P>
The corruption has also played a pivotal role in driving away
foreign investment, seen as the only way to free Bosnia from
dependence on foreign assistance.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Military Construction Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
signed an 8.4-billion-U.S.-dollar spending bill Tuesday to
underwrite new military construction.
</P>
<P>
The Military Construction Appropriations Act pays for "the vast
majority" of his requested military construction projects and
housing program, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"The requested projects are critical to supporting military
readiness and the quality of life of our soldiers and their
families," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Clinton criticized legislators for providing 93 million
dollars less than he requested for a chemical weapons
decommissioning program and adding 301 million dollars for 40
projects the Pentagon did not list as priorities.
