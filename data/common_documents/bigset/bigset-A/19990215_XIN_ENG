<HEADLINE> Vessel Runs into Lighthouse at Alexandria Harbor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 14 (Xinhua) -- A Greek vessel on Sunday smashed
into a lighthouse and suffered serious damages at the entrance of
the Alexandria harbor.
</P>
<P>
The vessel broke down when it was about to sail into the harbor
as its engines caught fire, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
A Greek tugboat was called in to pull the vessel out of the
harbor for repair. But in the process, the tugging rope was
suddenly snapped and the vessel rushed to the lighthouse.
</P>
<P>
The collision severely damaged the base of the lighthouse and
many of its facilities, including 12 solar cells, two lights and a
number of electric appliances.
</P>
<P>
The loss is estimated at 10 million Egyptian pounds (2.94
million U.S. dollars), the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
There is no report of casualties and the security department of
the Alexandria port authority is investigating the accident.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Fights Expensive Civil War: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 14 (Xinhua) -- A new study has found that
from 1983 to 1996 the war between the government and Tamil rebels
cost the economy about 1,153 billion rupees or the equivalent of
the total value of 18 months of the country's gross domestic
product (GDP) at 1996 levels.
</P>
<P>
"That means we have lost one whole year and a half of the GDP,"
said Dr. Saman Kelegama, executive director of the Institute of
Policy Studies (IPS), quoting from the new IPS study to be
released in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
He was giving out details, for the first time, of the think
tank's unpublished study on the economic cost of the war, at a
Colombo seminar organized by the Sri Lanka Association of
Economists last week.
</P>
<P>
The war loss estimated by IPS sounds surprising, but it is only
equal to about half of the amount calculated by the private Marga
Institute.
</P>
<P>
In January last year, the Marga Institute presented a similar
research study on the economic losses of the war from 1983 to 1996
and in that research the loss in terms of economic growth was put
at 2,260 billion rupees.
</P>
<P>
The Marga study took into account costs of government and rebel
expenditures, helping displaced people, output losses, falling
tourism levels, easing foreign investment, damage to
infrastructure, among other issues.
</P>
<P>
In last week's presentation, Kelegama said that defense
expenditure, which averages 50 billion rupees a year now, has
created large budget deficits and curbed foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The IPS chief said that had defense spending not increased,
this money could have been invested in more productive investment
and consumption, noting that the same principle should be applied
to the military expenditure of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam.
</P>
<P>
"What about damaged infrastructure and the cost of maintaining
about 750,000 refugees," he asked.
</P>
<P>
In terms of lost income and missed opportunities, Kelegama said
that Kenya, the Maldives and Mauritius, which had lower tourist
arrivals than Sri Lanka in 1982, have gone way past the Sri Lankan
level now which hovers around 300,000 arrivals.
</P>
<P>
"It was a case of lost earnings and missed opportunities,"
noted the IPS economist, adding that there were other hidden
losses like the flight of capital and the brain drain.

<HEADLINE> Weapons Row Hits Peace Process in N.Irish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern on Sunday denied saying Sinn Fein should be banned from
joining Belfast's assembly unless the IRA decommissions its arms.
</P>
<P>
An Irish government statement said he was not specifically
referring to Sinn Fein when making his comments on disarming
paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
The statement insisted Ahern had said "that all parties, and
that includes Sinn Fein, have to clear their minds on how they
will proceed to implement this responsibility (decommissioning)."
</P>
<P>
The new row on arms was triggered when Ahern was quoted in the
Sunday Times apparently suggesting that without some IRA
disarmament, Sinn Fein could not take up ministerial posts in a
new executive.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as telling the paper: "It is not compatible with
being part of a government and an executive if there is not at
least a commencement of decommissioning."
</P>
<P>
The Northern Ireland Peace Agreement does not specifically say
that getting rid of weapons is a precondition for taking part in a
new executive, which Sinn Fein says vindicates their position.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in an interview recorded before the latest row, the
Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams told the BBC's On the Record
program there was little to be achieved in trying to persuade the
IRA to start decommissioning now.
</P>
<P>
"The IRA feels it has taken its guns out of commission -- they
are not being used and it has maintained a cessation."
</P>
<P>
On Monday the 108 members of the Northern Ireland Assembly are
to meet to discuss how the body should proceed.
</P>
<P>
They will discuss a report by Northern Ireland First Minister
David Trimble and his nationalist deputy Seamus Mallon which paves
the way for transferring power from London to Belfast.
</P>
<P>
That is scheduled to take place on March 10, but without
agreement on decommissioning, it seems unlikely to take place as
planned.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu, Frenkel Discuss Economic Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 14 (Xinhua)-- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu met Sunday with Bank of Israel Governor Jacob
Frenkel for the first time in six months and discussed with him
the economic situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's office said that during the meeting, Frenkel
briefed Netanyahu on Israel's improved balance of payments in
1998 as well as on the significant growth in sophisticated
industrial exports.
</P>
<P>
The Governor also related to positive developments in the
effort to stem inflation and the country's profitabliity of
exports.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu expressed his satisfaction over the fact that the
state budget of 1999 was approved by the Knesset (parliament)
without any deviation from budgetary targets and without
requiring a tax increase.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two broke down after a meeting in last
August between Frenkel, Netanyahu and the then finance minister
Ya'akov Ne'eman, during which it was decided to cut interest
rates, lower the slope of the diagonal fluctuation band and set
the interest target for 1999.
</P>
<P>
Frenkel publicly blasted Netanyahu after the meeting, leading
to breakdown in their relations.
</P>
<P>
During the last six months and even after Ne'eman quit the
finance ministry two months ago and Netanyahu took over the
finance portfolio, the prime minister never asked Frenkel to take
part in the government sessions devoted to economic subjects,
even though Frenkel is the government's official economic
advisor.
</P>
<P>
Sources in Jerusalem said Sunday that Netanyahu has evidently
initiated Sunday's meeting with Frenkel to clear the air before
the election in May.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the meeting is of particular importance given
that two finance ministers, Ne'eman and Dan Meridor, resigned
during Netanyahu's term in office, a fact that Natanyahu fears
will give ammunition to the opposition in the coming elections.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Denies U.N. Charges of Atrocities in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman of the west African
peace- keeping force of ECOMOG Sunday denied a U.N.'s accusation
of ECOMOG's involvement in atrocities in capital Freetown, saying
"ECOMOG troops are professionals and we make sure that all
international conventions on war are observed."
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG spokesman Chris Kolade said in a statement on
pro-government radio in Sierra leone that the accusation by the
United Nations published by international media was incorrect.
</P>
<P>
He specifically denied allegations that ECOMOG soldiers
executed detainees who were allegedly either rebels or
collaborators with rebels who attacked Freetown last month.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that all rebels including child soldiers
captured during the counter offensive launched by ECOMOG troops
last month were still in the custody of the peace-keeping force.
</P>
<P>
Kolade suggested that summary executions referred to in the
U.N. report circulated last Friday could have been carried out by
members of a civilian militia allied with ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. report blamed the rebel Revolutionary United Front for
most of the atrocities in two weeks of fighting in Freetown which
health officials estimated killed at least 3,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of civilians were maimed by the rebels who also burned
an estimated one fifth of buildings in the capital of Sierra
leone, according to the U.N. report.

TEHRAN, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran denied Sunday a report
saying that the missing Saudi millionaire, Osama Bin Laden, has
entered Iranian territory, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, some media quoted a Pakistan security
official as saying that Bin Laden has possibly entered Iran since
he was seen near the Iranian border with Afghanistan before his
missing.
</P>
<P>
An informed source at the Iranian Foreign Ministry termed the
remarks as "irresponsible and regrettable," with an aim of
diverting the attention of the public opinion.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from the Afghan Taliban militia announced Saturday
that Bin Laden was missing even if he was not forced to leave
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan Islamic Press reported Saturday that the Taliban has
banned Bin Laden from accepting any visitors or having outside
contact. All communication equipment including his telephone and
radio have been withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden has been accused by the U.S. of masterminding a spate
of terrorist acts, including the bombings at the U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania August 7, which claimed more than 200 lives.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Chief Leaves for Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid left here for Kuwait on Sunday for a four-day
visit.
</P>
<P>
Before departure, Abdel-Meguid told reporters that he will hold
talks with Kuwaiti officials on the latest developments in the
Middle East, especially the situation in Iraq since mid-December
and the deadlock in the Palestinian-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is in a standoff with the U.N. Special Commission,
overseeing the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction,
after the U.S. and Britain launched a four-day attack on it in
mid-December for what the U.S. said Iraq's failure to comply with
the U.N. arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel is in
deadlock due to Israel's failure to carry out the Wye peace
agreement signed between the two sides last October in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid said that he will also attend a conference on
legal and judicial data networks in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
He will also take part in a meeting of the Arab-African
Coordination Committee on cooperation between the two sides,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
After wrapping up his trip to Kuwait, the chief of the
22-nation pan-Arab forum will travel to Khartoum for a three-day
visit, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to hold talks with Sudanese President Omar
al-Bashir and Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail, during which
he will underline Arab solidarity with Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. launched an air raid on a Sudanese pharmaceutical
plant near the capital last August on the excuse that the plant
was a base of international terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League strongly condemned the attack on the Sudanese
civil target, which reportedly produced half of the medicine for
the country's domestic market.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Guinea-Bissau President Joao
Bernardo Vieira said in Bissau Sunday that peace in the west
African state would last indefinitely, a report reaching here
said.
</P>
<P>
"Peace in Guinea-Bissau is here to stay for ever," the
Portuguese news agency Lusa, in a report from Bissau, quoted
Vieira as saying after an hour-long meeting with rebel leader
Ansumane Mane.
</P>
<P>
It was the first meeting between the two men in the former
Portuguese colony since the revolt broke out last June.
</P>
<P>
Vieira, who embraced mane calling him "brother", said he and
Mane had "agreed on all matters, not just to preserve peace, but
also on the problems of disarmament and quartering of troops."
</P>
<P>
The meeting was brokered by an EU's envoy visiting the west
African country.
</P>
<P>
A west African peace force has deployed as a buffer force
between forces loyal to president Vieira and rebels serving Mane,
whom Vieira sacked as army chief. Senegal and Guinea sent troops
to prop up Vieira after Mane took up arms.
</P>
<P>
Fighting earlier this month shattered a fragile truce on the
eve of the deployment of the peace-keeping force.
</P>
<P>
New elections are planned under peace proposals mediated by
Guinea-Bissau's west African neighbors and agreed in the Nigerian
capital Abuja last November.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Party Alliance Talks Break Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking official of the
All People' s Party (APP) said Sunday that alliance talks between
the Alliance for Democracy (AD) and the APP broke down because of
a disagreement over which party would take the presidential slot.
</P>
<P>
The AD was insisting that the joint candidate must contest
under its platform, the unidentified official of the APP said in
the northern city of Kaduna, venue of the Sunday convention of the
party to produce its presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
APP spokesman Obinna Nnaji told reporters after a meeting of
the APP executive that it had chosen little known aspirant
Ogbonnaya Onu as its candidate for the February 27 presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
The AD, which had already selected Chief Olu Falae as its
presidential candidate, persisted in producing the joint
presidential candidate of the two parties although it came behind
the APP in the local and state elections held last December and in
January this year.
</P>
<P>
The controversy over the proposed alliance, which is believed
to be the best option for defeating the dominant People's
Democratic Party, has been trailed to a decision by the
Independent National Electoral Commission which described the
alliance announced by the two parties as illegal.
</P>
<P>
Even within the APP, the alliance is not popular as most of its
 presidential aspirants see it as a threat to their presidential
ambition.
</P>
<P>
Last week, six of the APP presidential aspirants wrote to the
party's Chairman, Senator Mahmud Waziri, condemning any
arrangement which would produce its flag bearer and his running
mate outside the list of the party's aspirants.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Raise Steel Production Capacity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced on Monday to
raise its annual steel production capacity to 14.7 million tonnes
by the end of its third five-year development plan (2000-2005).
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of National Iranian Steel Company Mostafa
Moazenzadeh said that his company needs an investment of 3.7
billion U.S. dollars plus 9,300 billion rials (about 3.1 billion
dollars) to attain the target.
</P>
<P>
He put the country's steel production capacity at 7 million
tonnes at present and its annual steel output 6 million tonnes,
the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Moazenzadeh said that 26 projects are due to be implemented
for this purpose, and the most important among the projects will
be implemented with the cooperation of a Japanese company.
</P>
<P>
He said that the steel mill with a production capacity of 2
million tonnes of steel ingots will be constructed in the
southern Hormuzgan province within four years on a buy-back
contract with a Japanese company.
</P>
<P>
Iran will shoulder no expenses for the project and the
investments to be made in the project by the Japanese company
will be repaid through sale of the factory's products in a 10 year
period, the official said.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not give the name of the Japanese company and
the amount of necessary investments needed for the project.
</P>
<P>
Moazenzadeh also said that Iran will raise iron ore production
capacity to 22.9 million tonnes from 10 million tonnes at present
and that of coal to 3.1 million tonnes from 1 million tonnes.
</P>

<HEADLINE> EU Considers Interim Options on Hormone Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) is
considering three options on a 12-year-old ban on American hormone-
treated beef between now and when pertinent scientific evidence
can be established.
</P>
<P>
A European Commission spokesman said Monday that compensation,
temporary lifting of the ban, and labeling the origin of
production were the three options now under consideration by the
council of ministers and the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation bloc has to comply until May 13 with a World
Trade Organization (WTO) ruling upholding a United States
complaint that the EU ban on hormone-treated beef violates
multilateral trade rules.
</P>
<P>
The United States wants the ban to be lifted as soon as
possible and warned the EU that it will face the risk of trade
retaliation if it ignores the WTO ruling.
</P>
<P>
The compensation option suggests the EU keep the ban in place
but negotiate with the U.S. for loss of trade in the form of lower
tariffs to other agricultural products from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The temporary ban-lifting option suggests that the ban be
lifted for the time being and then reinstated after pertinent
scientific evidence is found that hormone-treated beef is
detrimental to human health.
</P>
<P>
The labeling option suggests the EU show the origin of U.S.-
imported beef but the labeling only concerns the origin of
production, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"Final solution to the problem will not be available until late
this year or early next year when the EU completes its scientific
studies on human health-related effects of hormones used in animal
growth promotion.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the European
Union, is conducting studies on six hormones used by the Americans
for animal growth promotion.
</P>
<P>
The WTO last February demanded that the EU produce pertinent
scientific evidence to justify its ban on hormone-treated beef.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warplanes Strike Sites in Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON February 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. warplanes struck at
Iraqi defense sites in the northern "no-fly" zone on two separate
occasions, a Defense Department spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Two F-15E's were fired upon by an antiaircraft artillery site
north of Mosul, which is some 400 kilometers north of Baghdad, Lt.
Col. Steve Campbell said. In response, one of the fighter planes
dropped a 500-pound bomb on the site.
</P>
<P>
The fighter planes returned undamaged to their base in Incirlik,
southern Turkey, U.S. officials said. The incident occurred about
11:26 a.m. Iraqi time (06:26 GMT), Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
In a separate confrontation, a U.S. warplane launched a missile
at an Iraqi radar site that had targeted it about an hour later,
Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
He said military officials were still assessing damage to the
Iraqi sites.
</P>
<P>
The strikes coincided with a visit by Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz, who met with Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit to voice displeasure at Turkey for allowing U.S. and
British forces the use of Incirlik.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Meets Opposition Group Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat met in Ramallah Monday with
the delegation of an opposition group in an attempt to start
national dialogue.
</P>
<P>
According to the Voice of Palestine, Arafat and the delegation
of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP)
discussed issues surrounding a national dialogue among
Palestinian factions.
</P>
<P>
Qayas Abu Lailah, head of the delegation, said the meeting
addressed the possibility of such a dialogue and that a meeting
between Arafat and DFLP leader Nayef Hawatmeh.
</P>
<P>
DFLP has been opposing any peace agreement with Israelis and
the stance of the PNA in this respect. However, Hawatmeh shook
hands with Israeli President Ezer Weizman at the funeral of
Jordan's King Hussein last week.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, Hawatmeh was sacked on Sunday by the
Palestinian opposition alliance, the Syria-based Supreme National
Preparatory Committee.
</P>
<P>
Lailah, also a DFLP political bureau member, said the
delegation discussed with Arafat about the date of May 4, in
which Arafat intends to declare an independent Palestinian state
when the five-year interim period of the Oslo Accords ends.
</P>
<P>
"We told Arafat that we support the call for a meeting of the
Palestinian National Council on the coming May to decide this
matter," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said preparations are going on for the coming Cairo meeting
between Arafat and Hawatmeh and the DFLP supports the two to hold
such a meeting to discuss the current situation inside Palestine.
</P>
<P>
The DFLP also supports Arafat to hold national dialogue with
all Palestinian factions to discuss the issues concerning the
peace process with the Israelis, he said.

<HEADLINE> 990238 Ethiopia Says U.N. Resolution "Unfair" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia said Monday that
the resolution adopted by the United Nations Security Council on
February 10 on the crisis between Ethiopia and Eritrea is
"puzzling" and "unfair".
</P>
<P>
"That the Security Council should... adopt resolution 1227
(1999), with provisions which signal denial to the victim of
aggression of its rights of self-defense, provided for under U.N.
Charter and sanctioned by international law, is as puzzling as its
unfair," the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry said in a statement issued
here.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the "resolution obviously would have the
effect of encouraging the aggressor to persist in its
intransigence and to continue even more to frustrate the effort of
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) ."
</P>
<P>
When Eritrea faced a growing international pressure calling on
it to accept the OAU peace plan and found itself pinned down, it
responded to this by a new and large-scale offensive on February 6
to undermine and scuttle the OAU peace plan, it noted.
</P>
<P>
"Security Council resolution 1227 is a reward for this Eritrean
 dangerous gamble. It took no account of how much the people of
Ethiopia would be wounded and hurt by it," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the resolution which strongly urges all
states to end immediately all sales of arms and munition to
Ethiopia and Eritrea, is especially "patently misleading" and
"reflects double standard".
</P>
<P>
It statement insists that aggression was committed by Eritrea
against Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
"A country whose territory has been occupied and which
therefore has all the legitimate right of self-defense under the
U.N. Charter and under international law is being told it has no
right to defend itself against invasion by a country that has not
only committed aggression but has also refused to accept all peace
proposals that have been made so far," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The over nine-month Ethio-Eritrean border dispute resumed
full-scale fighting on February 6. Last week the OAU and U.N.
Security Council called on both Ethiopia and Eritrea to stop
immediately their border fighting.

<HEADLINE> Serial Killer, Father Sentenced in Estonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 15 (Xinhua)  -- The court of Tallinn, in the
Estonian capital, sentenced 18-year-old Alexander Rubel to eight
years in prison on Monday for the murder of seven people.
</P>
<P>
Under Estonian law, he could not be sentenced to a longer term
because he was only 17 when he committed the crimes, the Interfax
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said that if Rubel had been of age at the time
of the murders, the prosecution would not have hesitated to demand
a life sentence. Estonia has no death penalty.
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, between September 19, 1997, and
June 4, 1998, Rubel killed seven people in the Kopli neighborhood
of Tallinn. The victims were persons he had met by chance and who
were sick or weaker than him. Most of his victims were reportedly
drunk.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to see what it was like to kill someone," Rubel
said, explaining the motive for his first murder. "I felt better
after that. Earlier it was so difficult. After killing one, you
immediately want more. I liked to kill," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rubel had claimed earlier that he was forced to kill by voices
he heard after inhaling gasoline fumes, but in October 1998,
experts declared him sound of mind at the time of the murders.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rubel's father, Andrei Rubel, 40, was also found
guilty of a brutal murder and badly maiming a second victim. He
was sentenced to seven years in prison, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Former Azeri Premier Sentenced to Life in Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Azerbaijan
announced Monday that former Prime Minister Suret Guseinov had
been sentenced to life imprisonment for treason.
</P>
<P>
Guseinov, 40, was found guilty of unlawful weapons possession,
embezzlement, and the formation of unlawful military units during
a coup attempt in October 1994. He was also found guilty of an
attempt on the life of President Geidar Aliyev in 1995, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Between July 1992 and February 1993, Guseinov was Azeri deputy
prime minister, a plenipotentiary representative of the Azeri
president in the conflicting Nagorno-Karbakh, and a commander of
the second division of the Azeri Army.
</P>
<P>
In February 1993, he was stripped of all posts by then
President Abulfaz Elichibey. In June 1993, while serving as a
commander of troops loyal to him, he rebuffed an attack by
government troops, marched with his military units across the
entire country, and demanded the resignation of Elichibey.
</P>
<P>
As a result of talks with Aliyev, an agreement was reached and
he was given the right to form a new government. In July 1993, he
became the Azeri prime minister.
</P>
<P>
On October 6, 1994, he was removed from the post of prime
minister. The parliament also stripped him of his deputy's mandate
and accused him of involvement in an abortive coup d'etat.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's ANC Announces Candidates for Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling
African National Congress (ANC) announced Monday the lists of
candidates, who will stand for this year's general elections in
the national and provincial levels.
</P>
<P>
On the national-to-national list, ANC President Thabo Mbeki
appeared on top, followed by his deputy in the party, Jacob Zuma,
and Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma, ex-wife of Jacob Zuma.
</P>
<P>
Controversial ANC Women's League President Winnie
Madikizela-Mandela occupies the 10th place on the list of 177.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Johannesburg, ANC Secretary-General
Kgalema Motlanthe said the listing of these two women was the
outcome of a democratic process.
</P>
<P>
"That (The ordering of the list) is the reflection of how the
ANC and alliance members feel about those comrades. That's an
expression of confidence in those comrades."
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the listing did not indicate any preference
in terms of cabinet members.
</P>
<P>
Madikizela-Mandela was found involved in apartheid-era
atrocities during Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings in
1997. She was also known for her radical political views.
</P>
<P>
Nkosazana Zuma was often attacked by opposition parties for
pushing through parliament draconian health legislation.
</P>
<P>
Motlanthe made it clear that the lists were provisional and
asked the media not to speculate on who will be included in the
new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to take this opportunity to remind the media and
 everybody that the appointment of cabinet members is the
prerogative of the state president," he said in a statement read
at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the listing was a year-long "process that
combined democratic participation and strategic political
intervention."
</P>
<P>
All candidates for provincial premiers will be appointed by the
 president of the ANC after consultation with relevant structures
of the movement, it said. Mbeki has already begun consultations
about the matter and the appointments will be released as soon as
possible, Motlanthe said.
</P>
<P>
Motlanthe also said a candidate was not necessarily included in
the province-to-province list for him/her to be appointed premier.
</P>
<P>
The province-to-province list is candidates for provincial
legislatures.
</P>
<P>
The provincial-to-national list is candidates from provinces to
be elected to the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution, 200 of the 400 members of the National
Assembly will be elected nationally and the other 200 from
provinces.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Tibetan New Year falls on
February 17 this year and Tibet Autonomous Region has had a
festive atmosphere since the beginning of the month.
</P>
<P>
The following are some of the Tibetans' celebrations:
</P>
<P>
 Plentiful Festival Non-Staple Food Supply
</P>
<P>
-- There are more than 30 kinds of fresh vegetables along with
abundant supplies of fresh fish, shrimps, crab, mutton, and beef
in the capital, Lhasa, where residents have said good-bye to the
days of potatoes, radishes, and Chinese cabbage being major
vegetables in winter. Many of these items were trucked in from
other provinces on the Sichuan-Tibet highway.
</P>
<P>
 Busy Goldsmiths
</P>
<P>
-- Tibetan women traditionally wear gold jewelry during the new
year period and as the Tibetan new year and Chinese lunar new year
approach, goldsmiths in Lhasa have been so making jewelry that
they are turning away customers. The city's nearly 100 goldsmiths,
most of whose owners come from Fujian Province, are busy.
</P>

Living Buddha Attends Religious Dance Festival
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> U.S  Warplanes in Turkey Carry out Missions in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. warplanes have taken off
from Incirlik air base in Adana, southern Turkey, on Monday to
carry out missions over northern Iraq, the semi-official Anatolia
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A batch of F-15 fighting jets, F-16 warplanes, Prowlers
planes, tanker planes and AWACS planes took off from Incirlik
Monday morning to patrol the no-fly zone in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. warplanes were expected to bombard the anti-aircraft
batteries in the no-fly zone in the north when visiting Iraqi
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz is holding official talks in
Ankara with Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit on the Incirlik,
the tense ties between Turkey and Iraq and the latest developments
in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. bombings of Iraqi sites in the restricted zones have
become commonplace recently after four days of U.S.-British air
strikes against Iraq in mid-December last year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its allies imposed two no-fly zones in
northern and southern Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War, allegedly
to protect the Kurds and the Shiite Muslims from Baghdad's
suppression.
</P>
<P>
There are 45 allied warplanes stationed in Incirlik as part
of the Operation Northern Watch to patrol the northern no-fly
zone.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said in Baghdad on Thursday that he would ask Turkey
to terminate the U.S. and British mandate to use the Incirlik
base and halt their attacks on Iraqi military facilities in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said that "we will
greet Aziz with goodwill and warmth that suits a host. But
everyone should know that a visit cannot change our policies."
</P>
<P>
However, Cem rejected suggestions that Turkey should annul
permission for U.S. and British jets to use Incirlik.
</P>
<P>
"The status of the Incirlik base has been regulated by
Parliament. Our government does not have any contrary view,"
said Cem.

<HEADLINE> 5 Iraqi Civilians Killed in U.S.-British Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Five Iraqi civilians were
killed and 22 others injured on Monday when the U.S.-British
warplanes launched missile attacks on targets in southern Iraq,
an Iraqi military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that 21 formations of U.S.-British
warplanes from the Saudi and Kuwaiti bases violated Iraqi
airspace in southern provinces of Dhi-Qar, Missan and Barah at
9:40 (0640 GMT) and targeted the Iraqi civilian properties.
</P>
<P>
Eleven formations of U.S. warplanes from a Turkish military
base also violated Iraqi airspace and attacked air defense sites
in Dohuk, Neineva provinces, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
"Aggressors has not come to reason yet and they insist on
killing more Iraqi women, men, children and the elderly and
destroying their properties while those who were involved in
such aggressive war are still silent and care-free," said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He was echoing a statement issued after a meeting of
senior Iraqi officials chaired by President Saddam Hussein late
Sunday night in which Iraq warned the rulers of Saudi Arabia
and Kuwait of the consequences of being involved in U.S.-British
aggressive war against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In that statement, Iraq claimed it is "able to target
sources and means of aggression, and from any where it is
launched, after relying on God and the support of our Arab
Nation."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has accused Saudi Arabia and Kuwait of facilitating
U.S.-British air strikes against Iraq in mid-December and
allowing them to use their bases to patrol the no-fly zone
in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed no-fly zones in Iraq in
the wake of the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in
the south from Baghdad's suppression.
</P>
<P>
After mid-December bombardment, Iraq announced that it would
not recognize the no-fly zones and would fire at U.S.-British
jets patrolling the restricted zones.
</P>
<P>
Clashes between Iraq air defense units and U.S.-British jets
since then have almost become daily occurrence, with a total
of 36 Iraqi civilians killed and more than 100 others injured.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has vowed recently to continue confronting U.S.-British
warplanes violating its airspace regardless of sacrifices and
consequences.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, EU to Liberalize Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Trade between South
Africa and the European Union (EU) will be extensively liberalized
in the next 10 years, according to a draft trade deal between the
two sides which was unveiled Monday.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's Chief Director of Bilateral Trade, Bahle Sibisi,
told parliament Monday that the agreement will see 95 percent of
South African exports to the EU duty-free within 10 years, while
tariffs on 86 percent of the EU's exports to South Africa will be
dropped within 12 years.
</P>
<P>
The deal provides for the protection of South Africa's
sensitive industries - automobiles and components, textiles,
clothing, red meat, sugar, winter grains and dairy, South African
Press Association quoted Sibisi as saying.
</P>
<P>
The deal was struck last month between South African trade
Minister Alec Erwin and Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the EU commissioner
responsible for Africa. It has got the nod from the South African
cabinet and is yet to be approved by the EU Council of Ministers,
which meets next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on reports that certain EU countries were unhappy
with the deal, Sibisi said this is "an internal process they will
have to work through." "Hopefully senses will prevail," he added.
</P>
<P>
One of the main sticking points in finalizing the agreement was
Spain and Portugal's insistence that South Africa wine producers
stop using the brand names "Port" and "Sherry", which the two
countries see as their exclusive brands.
</P>
<P>
The issue was covered in a wines and spirits agreement,
negotiated in parallel to the main trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
Sibisi said South Africa had agreed to phase out use of the
names in countries outside the 14-nation Southern African
Development Community (SADC) within five years.
</P>
<P>
In the SADC region outside Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho,
Swaziland and South Africa, the names will be phased out over
eight years.
</P>
<P>
Within the five countries, which constitutes the Southern
African Customs Union (SACU), the names will continue to be used
over the next 12 years. After that the issue will be reviewed by
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
In compensation, the EU will allow 32 million liters of South
African wine to be imported duty-free at the inception of the
trade protocol, and will give South Africa 15 million Euro to help
market new brand names in the place of "Port" and "Sherry".
</P>
<P>
Sibisi said South Africa had refused to bow to the EU's demands
for a parallel fisheries agreement allowing the EU access to South
Africa's fishing waters.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the EU wanted to hold back tariff concessions to
South African fishing products, he said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported earlier that some EU countries, including
Spain, Italy, Portugal and France, considered the wine resolution
too generous to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Other EU members, including Germany and Holland, reportedly
want the agreement to include a clause covering repatriation of
illegal aliens to their countries of origin.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Opposition Unaware of Osama's Whereabouts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Mystery continues to shroud
the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden as anti-Taliban grouping Monday
declined to comment on the reports that Osama has moved into the
opposition-held areas in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"I have no comments to offer" on the reports suggesting that
Osama is in the areas controlled by the anti-Taliban alliance, the
Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) quoted an opposition spokesman
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Some media reports said that Osama bin Laden had left the
Taliban stronghold of Kandahar several days ago with 10
supporters, including the head of Egypt's Jihad group, Ayman
el-Zawahri, and a dozen Taliban soldiers.
</P>
<P>
He "momentarily" stopped in a northern Afghan area controlled
by former Afghan prime minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's
Hezb-i-Islami faction, one report quoted Afghan sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hekmatyar, who is part of opposition grouping, has some
supporters in northern Baghlan province locked in fighting with
the Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
Taliban's spokesman at the U.N. Noorullah Zadra has said that
Osama might have sought refuge with the opposition or might have
left Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban authorities said last Saturday that the Saudi
dissident, wanted in the August bombings of U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania, had left his abode in southwestern Afghanistan
for an unknown destination.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban officials said they were not aware that Osama was
still in Afghanistan or left the country.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been pressing Taliban to extradite Osama. The
Taliban turned down the U.S. demand. However, they last week
restricted the activities of bin Laden, who denies charges of his
involvement in East African bombings.

<HEADLINE> EU Proposes Candidate States For Full FP5 Association </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission has
submitted to the council of ministers draft decisions on the full
association of seven European Union candidate countries with the
union's research program, commission officials said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The commission proposed full association with the Fifth
Framework Program (FP5) for Research, Technological Development
and Demonstration (1998-2002) for the Czech Republic, Estonia,
Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
Similar proposals are expected to follow for Bulgaria, Romania,
Slovakia and Cyprus, commission officials said.
</P>
<P>
Once the proposals are adopted by the European council of
ministers, the 11 candidate countries for EU membership will be
able to participate fully in the research program alongside
existing EU member states.
</P>
<P>
Candidate countries will contribute to the research budget and
in return will participate in the program under very similar
conditions as the research institutes, universities and industries
from the existing member states.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, believes that full FP5 association will not only benefit
the candidate countries but the EU member states as well.
</P>
<P>
All the 11 candidate countries have negotiated association with
the EU research program. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary,
Latvia, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia have also applied for
association with the Euratom FP5 for nuclear research. The other
candidate countries only applied for non-nuclear research
assistance.
</P>
<P>
The association of candidate countries with the FP5 was
envisaged by the commission and was later confirmed by the
European council at heads of state and government level in
December 1997.

<HEADLINE> Tung Chee Hwa Confident about HK's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief
executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,
expressed his confidence in Hong Kong's future despite the present
economic downturn when delivering his Lunar New Year message here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said: "I am confident we will emerge in much better shape,
provided we remember our strengths, build on them and focus on
sharpening our competitive edge."
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the past 20 months after Hong Kong's return to China
on July 1, 1997, Tung said for Hong Kong, the implementation of
the principle of "one country, two systems" and the fight against
the financial turmoil are both unprecedented challenges.
</P>
<P>
As a government, he said: "We have done a good deal to address
those challenges. The Central Government has always been fully
supportive of Hong Kong. They are genuinely concerned about our
stability and prosperity and we can always feel their care and
concern for us."
</P>
<P>
Tung said that he has also been in close contact with
international financial leaders and is pleased to learn they have
remained positive about Hong Kong's economic prospects.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the economy of the mainland has been enjoying
steady growth which is beneficial to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, he said there have been positive signs of
stability in some of the Asian economies. If this trend continues,
it will help speed up Hong Kong's recovery, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tung said: "As we approach the 21st century, we will all want
our economy to show steady growth and to see our children enjoy a
better quality of life."
</P>
<P>
"To achieve this," he said, "We must push ahead with education,
innovation and technology to create a knowledge-based society.
</P>
<P>
"The government is committed to investing in the improvement of
our human resources. We will also continue with our efforts to
fulfill our long-term goals in improving other social services,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Tung urged people to remain united and work towards their
common goals in front of challenges.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that with the undoubted drive,
initiative and the talents of the people, Hong Kong can clear all
obstacles and forge ahead into a brighter future.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the Lunar New year, Tung and his wife Betty Tung
sent a Lunar New Year greeting card to the people of Hong Kong via
the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Says Able to Target Sources, Means of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has warned that it is
able to target the sources and means of U.S.-British aggression
against it, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after a meeting of senior Iraqi
officials chaired by President Saddam Hussein late Sunday night,
Iraq warned the rulers of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait of the
consequences of being involved in U.S.-British aggressive war
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"You are now involved in an aggressive war which the peoples of
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have no interest in, but America and
Zionist do," said the statement carried by INA.
</P>
<P>
"If you are helpless and you have no desire for the aggression,
we are able to target sources and means of aggression, and from
any where it is launched, after relying on God and the support of
our Arab Nation," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
It warned Saudi and Kuwait rulers, "if you are doing
that deliberately to kill more Iraqi women, children and the
elderly and destroy Iraqi property, God is above you."
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting were Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary
Command Council (RCC), Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadhan and
member of the RCC Ali Hassan al-Majeed.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has accused Saudi Arabia and Kuwait of facilitating
U.S.-British air strikes against Iraq in mid-December and
allowing U.S.-British warplanes to use their bases to patrol the
no-fly zones in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed no-fly zones in Iraq in
the wake of the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
Baghdad's suppression.
</P>
<P>
After mid-December bombardment, Iraq announced that it would
not recognize the no-fly zones and would fire at U.S.-British
jets patrolling the restricted zones, and clashes between Iraq
air defense units and U.S.-British jets have almost become daily
occurrence since then.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has vowed recently to continue confronting U.S.-British
warplanes violating its airspace regardless of sacrifices and
consequences.

<P>
NAIROBI, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Hunger killed 26 people in the
past one month in Tana River District in Coast Province, eastern
Kenya, two local councilors have said.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen people, including 10 infants, reportedly died in Bura
sub- district and the other 10 died in Madogo division, said
councilors Simba Arte and Maalim Juma, quoted by Monday's Daily
Nation newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The two councilors appealed for emergency food aid in the
drought-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
Madogo District Officer J.W. Ndambuki said many people might
not be reached by the rescue operations due to lack of transport
as the affected areas are around 100 kilometers from the cereals
depot in Bura sub- district.
</P>
<P>
Due to poor rains in the short rain season spanning from
October to December last year and long-time severe drought,
hunger looms in various parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Mandera District in Kenya's North Eastern Province also
reported 22 deaths in the Shaffafe location in the same period
whereas the condition of many sick children were worsened by lack
of food.
</P>
<P>
A drought assessment report by government and local aid
agencies said 170,000 people in Wajir and Mandera Districts, both
in North Eastern Province, would starve if not given urgent relief
food aid. And in Mandera, some 8,000 children urgently need
supplementary feeding program.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last month, the Kenyan government decided to allocate
400 million Shillings ( 6.56 million U.S. Dollars) to purchase
maize to be sent the drought-stricken areas as relief food.

</P>
<P>
Speaking in Lusaka Sunday, Saviye said about 30,000 kilometers

He said road users and other stake-holders are expected to
contribute if road maintenance is to be conducted.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Obasanjo Emerges as Nigeria's PDP Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, February 15 (Xinhua) --Olusegun Obasanjo looks set to
return as a civilian president after he defeated six other
candidates to emerge as the candidate of the People's Democratic
Party for the February 27 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Former head of state General Olusegun Obasanjo, who retired
after handing over to Second Republic President Alhaji Shehu
Shagari less than 20 years ago, got 1,658 of the 2,439 votes cast
Monday at the end of the party' s three-day special national
convention held in Jos, Plateau State.
</P>
<P>
His closest rival and Shagari's Vice-President, Chief Alex
Ekwueme came a distant second with 521 votes followed by former
petroleum minister, Chief Don Etiebet who got 106 votes.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the date of Obasanjo's election as the PDP
candidate coincided with his emergence 23 years ago as Nigeria's
head of state after the assassination of General Murtala Mohammed
during an aborted coup on February 13, 1976.
</P>
<P>
In remarks after his election, Obasanjo pledged to serve
Nigerians with justice and fair play and restore good governance.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged to work with all members of the party and other
 Nigerians by building strong bridges and restoring the national
health of the country.
</P>
<P>
"With my election, you have buried the polarization between
soldiers and civilians," he said in reference to complaints that
as a retired general, his presidency would amount to the
perpetuation of military rule.
</P>
<P>
The two other parties, the Alliance for Democracy (AD) and the
All People's Party (APP) have already chosen their candidates for
the elections later this month.
</P>
<P>
Chief Olu Falae emerged as the AD candidate while Ogbonnya Onu,
former governor of Abia State, has been chosen as the APP
candidate.
</P>
<P>
Since relinquishing power, Obasanjo had been engaged in farming
in his Otta Farm after promising not to seek any elective office,
a statement that was latched onto by critics of his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
But, Obasanjo said he reconsidered his position after pleas to
help rescue the country from "friends and well-meaning people."

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Deputy Minister Against Excluding Sinn Fein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's Deputy First
Minister Seamus Mallon warned on Monday that excluding Sinn Fein
from the province's new cabinet would push back the time for
paramilitaries to hand over their weapons.
</P>
<P>
Mallon told BBC radio there was a widespread but false
assumption that excluding Sinn Fein from the power-sharing
executive would ensure arms "decommissioning" by the Irish
Republican Army (IRA).
</P>
<P>
"That is an unreal assumption. I am convinced ...that the only
context in which decommissioning will take place is within the
context of this agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Britain's plans for a handover of limited home-rule powers to
an executive on March 10, under the Northern Ireland peace
agreement reached last year, are threatened with delay by a bitter
row about when IRA guerrillas should begin to scrap arms.
</P>
<P>
But Mallon said he was confident political parties would vote
to support the creation of a new executive as laid out in last
year's "Good Friday" agreement.
</P>
<P>
"We have to go ahead today and I have no doubt the vote will be
won," he said.
</P>
<P>
A crucial two-day session of Northern Ireland's elected
assembly opens on Monday in Belfast.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Set Up Venture Capital Fund to Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will launch a
venture capital fund soon to help provide seed capital to new
start-up Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC)-status companies and pre
MSC-status companies, a senior official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The MSC Venture Corporation has been set up as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Multimedia Development Corporation (MDC) which
manages the MSC to manage the venture capital fund, MDC's
Executive Chairman Othman Yeop Abdulah said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to get for a start 100 million ringgit (about 26.315
million U.S. dollars) for the fund," he told reporters after MDC,
Australia-based Asia-Pacific Information Technology and
Telecommunications Corporation and Asia-Pacific Information
Technology Awards signed an agreement in Cyberjaya near here.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was for the establishment of an awards program
called Asia-Pacific Multimedia Super Corridor Information
Technology and Telecommunications Awards.
</P>
<P>
With the initial 100 million ringgit venture capital fund, MDC
could launch the actual support for start-up companies and other
information technology companies which are still at the
"mezzanine" level, he said.
</P>
<P>
Othman said that the comprehensive plan for the venture capital
fund has been approved by the MSC Implementation Council, headed
by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
</P>
<P>
He said that a few industry players had committed some amount
of capital for the fund, while MDC had decided to pledge 5 million
ringgit (about 1.315 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A business plan for the venture capital has been approved and a
workforce team headed by Sarina Karim from MDC has been appointed
to run the MSC Venture Corporation, he said, hoping they can get
the necessary funding within a couple of months.
</P>
<P>
Expected to gain real operational momentum by the third quarter
of this year, the venture capital fund would also support the
start-up of small and medium scale information technology
companies for the Initial Public Offerings status on the
soon-to-be-established Malaysian Exchange of Securities Dealing
and Automated Quotation, he said.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka's Export Fetches Over 5.2 Bln Dollars in 1997-98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's export earnings
during the 1997-98 fiscal year was estimated at 5.172 billion U.S.
dollars, up 16.8 percent from the previous fiscal year's 4.427
billion dollars, according to the central bank's report available
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
In its annual report for 1997-98 issued in Dhaka Sunday,
Bangladesh Bank (BB), the central bank of the country, said that
this growth had been attributed to the additional earnings from
ready-made garments and tea.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the import payments in the fiscal year stood
at 7.524 billion dollars, up 5.1 percent from the previous fiscal
year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The total trade deficit stood at 2.352 billion dollars in the
fiscal year, down by 383 million dollars from the preceding fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
The recession in the world economy, particularly a decelerating
trend in the economies of Japan and South Korea as well drastic
devaluation of currencies against the dollar in some Southeast
Asian economies might reduce the competitiveness of Bangladeshi
products in the global market, resulting in a long-term effect on
the country's exports, the report warned.
</P>
<P>
The report also reveals that the country's total foreign debts
increased by 440 million dollars and it stood at 14.813 billion
dollars, or 43.7 percent of the gross domestic product, at the end
of June 1998.
</P>
<P>
An amount of 445 million dollars as principal and interest was
paid for foreign debts during the fiscal year, which was 8.6
percent of the country's total export earnings, the report said.

MANILA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines is taking every
step necessary to comply with its international obligations on
Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs), a senior official said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, Presidential Spokesman Jerry
Barican said that the IPR office of the Department of Trade and
Industry has made its recommendations to bring the country's
intellectual property and enforcement systems to world standards
in general, and to the standards of the World Trade Organization
in particular.
</P>
<P>
While certain measures with respect to the protection of IPRs
have already been initiated by the government, substantial
compliance with the country's international commitments will be
expected only by the end of 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is included in the United States' Special 301
list, which enumerates economies notorious for violating
intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
The Special 301 trade law is aimed at advancing the protection
of U.S. IPR around the world. The program is reviewed by the

<HEADLINE> Japan's Current Account Surplus Rises 38.7 Percent in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Japan's current account surplus
hit a record high of 15,860.8 billion yen (about 121.1 billion U.S.
dollars) in 1998, up 38.7 percent form the previous year, the
Finance Ministry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials cited drastic decline in imports for the
sharp increase in the surplus, the second consecutive year-on-year
increase.
</P>
<P>
The previous record surplus of 14,669,0 billion yen (about 111.
9 billion dollars) was set in 1993.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the surplus in merchandise trade totaled 15,9993.2
billion yen (about 122.1 billion dollars), up 29.9 percent from
1997.
</P>
<P>
Exports declined 1.3 percent to 48,866.6 billion yen (372.9
billion dollars) and imports plummeted by 11.7 percent to 32,873.4
billion yen (250,9 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in five years for both exports and imports
to drop.
</P>
<P>
Japan's exports to Asia dropped 17.9 percent due to the
economic turmoil in the region. Exports to the United States
increased due mainly to a substantial rise in steel sales.
</P>
<P>
The services account showed a deficit of 6,403.7 billion yen (
48.9 billion dollars), slightly less than in 1997. The smaller
deficit reflects a decline in the number of Japanese tourists
going abroad.
</P>
<P>
The current account balance represents the difference between a
country's income from foreign sources and foreign obligations
payable, excluding net capital investment.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar averaged 131.02 yen in 1998, compared with 120.
92 yen in the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Defense Minister Leaves for Moscow for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' Defense Minister
Yiannakis Chrysostomis left for Moscow on Monday to arrange for
the deployment in Crete, Greek island, of the S-300 anti-aircraft
missiles Cyprus has bought from Russia.
</P>
<P>
Chrysostomis, who will meet with Russian Defense Minister Igor
Segeryev is to ink the new delivery deal with Russia's
state-owned arms maker, Rosvooruzheniye Company.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on his departure, Chrysostomis expressed certainty
that his talks in Moscow will be successful.
</P>
<P>
He said during the meeting with his Russian counterpart the
Cypriot side will put forward a proposal for amendments to an
existing agreement for technical backing, but did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' President Glafcos Clerides decided in December 1998
not to deploy the S-300 missiles in Cyprus, but on Greece's Crete
island, under intense international pressure and amid threats by
Turkey to launch pre-emptive strikes if the missiles were
deployed in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The S-300 missiles are said to equal, even surpass, in
accuracy the U.S.-made Patriot anti-missile system, which first
saw action in 1991 during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Despite deployment on Crete, the S-300 missiles will still
be owned by Cyprus and operated by Cypriot military personnel,
who have already been trained in Russia.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in Athens last week, Chrysostomis and his Greek
counterpart Akis Tsohatzopoulos reached an agreement for the
deployment of the S-300 missiles on Crete.
</P>
<P>
Chrysostomis said a delegation from the Greek Defense Ministry
will also participate in the Moscow talks with the manufacturing
company Rosvooruzheniye to achieve amendments to the contract.

<HEADLINE> GCC Countries Fail to Uniform Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The meeting of the Gulf finance
ministers and custom department directors in this Saudi capital
Sunday failed to reach consensus on the Gulf states united
tariffs.
</P>
<P>
According to well informed sources here Monday, the disputes
were concentrated on the suggested tariffs on the foreign imported
commodities and how to deal with them.
</P>
<P>
Some GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) member states believe the
commodities should be classified, while others hold that lists
should not be worked out, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the different point of view, the meeting was
trimmed to one instead of two days.
</P>
<P>
The sources affirmed the GCC related organizations could not
reach a compromise on classifying some 1289 imported commodities.
</P>
<P>
The recent GCC summit of Abu Dhabi recommended unifying the GCC
tariffs prior to ratifying the uniform tariff agreement at the
coming GCC Riyadh summit.

<HEADLINE> Toll in Police Building Fire Rises to 56 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The toll of a fire that gutted
the police building in Samara, Central Russia, rose to 56 on
Monday and 21 others are still listed as missing.
</P>
<P>
The city, in the middle reaches of Volga River, buried seven
more victims Monday as forensic experts struggled to identify
charred bodies beyond recognition, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out Wednesday night and was not put out until
Thursday morning. Authorities have launched an investigation into
the tragedy to see if it was caused by faulty electrical wiring,
or arson, as was widely suspected.
</P>
<P>
Many of the dead were those who leapt from the windows of the
five-story building, aiming desperately for drifts of snow, but
falling short and dying on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers are continuing combing the rubbles for more bodies but
some victims may never be found as their bodies were consumed by
a white-hot 15-hour blaze that melted the pistols and rifles in
the police arsenal into misshapen hunks, reports said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to killing law officers and witnesses brought in to
give testimony in criminal cases, the fire destroyed material
evidence, a crime lab and extensive archives on criminal cases.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Ten people have died and over
20 victim admitted to hospitals in several parts of Nyanza
Province, southwest Kenya, in the past two days as a new wave of
cholera epidemic struck the area.
</P>
<P>
Among the most hit areas include parts of Migori and Bondo
district in the province, which are actually affected by the
current dry spell, the official newspaper Kenya Times reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In Migori district, the worst affected areas include Muhuru and

</P>
<P>
At Asembo Bay Health Center, over 20 victims were admitted

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Receive Huge Sum of Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Egypt is expected to get 2.5
billion U.S. dollars in grants and loans offered recently by its
donor countries, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Ministry of International Cooperation will soon embark
on the executive procedures for receiving the funds undertaken at
a meeting of the donor countries in Paris last week, Minister of
Public Enterprises Atef Ebeid said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Of the total sum, 1.2 billion dollars are non-refundable grants
for Egypt, Ebeid said, adding that 300 million dollars are
long-term loans to be repaid in 20 to 40 years with an interest
rate of 2 to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 1 billion dollars will also be long-term loans
with a fixed interest rate.
</P>
<P>
Ebeid stressed that Egypt's foreign borrowing is limited to
annual repaying quota in an effort to avoid debts or increasing
budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's foreign debts, mostly in long terms, stood at 26
billion dollars in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
During the Paris meeting, representatives of 33 Western and
Arab countries and international financial institutions spoke
highly of Egypt's successful economic reforms, said Ebeid, who
represented Egypt at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Egypt started in 1991 the reforms, sponsored by the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund, loosening control over and
privatizing state-own enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the country's gross domestic product has grown from
2 percent to more than 5 percent, inflation fallen from 20 percent
to under 5 percent and foreign currency reserves climbed to 20
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Donors have also agreed to support Egypt's
small-and-medium-sized businesses and expressed readiness to
finance its national projects, including the Toshka project, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
The Toshka project, a land-reclamation project in southern
Egypt, is designed to create new communities in desert to lure
people to leave the overcrowded Nile Valley.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, a moderate Muslim country, plays a key role in
maintaining peace and stability in the Middle East. Western and
some Gulf Arab countries have provided it with large sum of money
and written off part of its debts to help keep it developing and
stable.

<P>
ANKARA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's separatist Kurdish
Democratic Party (KDP) said here that the KDP supports the visit
to Turkey by Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.
</P>
<P>
KDP Representative in Turkey Safeen Dizayee said that "We take
this opportunity to express our hope that the visit will be the
beginning of renewed cooperation between the Iraqi government and
the United Nations to end the current tension and alleviate the
suffering of Iraqi people," according to a press release faxed to
Xinhua on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Aziz came to Turkey through the region in northern Iraq
controlled by the KDP safely on Sunday for talks with Turkish
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit on the Incirlik Air Base in southern
Turkey, the tense bilateral ties and the latest developments in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Safeen said that the Turkish government had invited Aziz for
bilateral talks between Turkey and Iraq in a bid to ease the
heightened tension in the no-fly zones between Iraqi troops
and coalition warplanes led by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said in Baghdad on Thursday that he would ask Turkey
to terminate the U.S.-British mandate to use the Incirlik and
halt their attacks on Iraqi military facilities in northern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said Sunday "the
use of Incirlik was the decision of the Turkish parliament,"
which has renewed permission for the Incirlik-based Operation
Northern Watch since the end of the Gulf War, set off by
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Discovers Big Methane Gas Fields </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Shangani Energy
Exploration (SEE) has discovered big methane gas fields in Lupane
of west Zimbabwe, which could be sub-Saharan Africa's first
commercial coal-bed methane gas fields.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with daily Herald Sunday, SEE spokesman said
that the company has invested more than 2.4 billion Zimbabwean
Dollars (60 million U.S. Dollars) for the exploration and
development of the methane gas fields, the newspaper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that it will still be needed to build a
power station near the gas fields and undertake a full drilling
program for both further exploration and production before the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
The mining giant has discovered methane gas at a 177 square
kilometer area in Lupane. There is enough gas to last over 500
years. It will create in excess of 3,000 jobs and help reduce
costly power imports in the country.
</P>
<P>
The company is jointly owned by Zimbabwe's largest
ferrochromium producer, Zimbabwe Mining and Smelting Company
Holdings as a major shareholder, and Americans Paul Tromp and
James Logan, who are currently resident in the country.
</P>
<P>
Tromp, who is also the company's technical director, told the
Herald Sunday that the coal seams contained billions of cubic
metres of methane, enough to operate Zimbabwe's entire transport
fleet and also electrify outlying areas.
</P>
<P>
He said that besides producing electricity and transport fuels,
methane gas would be used in the manufacture of ammonia and
chemicals such as cyanide and agricultural fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
He added the gas fields have the potential to become one of the
country' s biggest industries.

invitation to Aziz upon a request from the Iraqi side to the
Turkish government.
</P>
<P>
"If the deputy prime minister of Iraq wants to discuss some
issues with Turkey he would eventually come here. There is nothing
to worry about the Iraqi official's visit, " Cem added.
</P>
<P>
Aziz arrived in Ankara Sunday for talks with Ecevit and other
high-level Turkish officials on the Incirlik Air Base used by the
U.S. warplanes, the tense bilateral ties and the latest
developments in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, on several occasions, voiced its displeasure with Ankara
for allowing the base to be used by U.S. warplanes to bombard the
anti-aircraft batteries in no-fly zone in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Cem said in the central Anatolian province of Kayseri on Sunday
that "We will greet Aziz with goodwill and warmth that suits a
host. But everyone should know that a visit cannot change our
policies."
</P>
<P>
However, Cem rejected suggestions that Turkey should annul
permission for U.S. and British jets to use Incirlik.
</P>
<P>
"The status of the Incirlik base has been regulated by
Parliament. Our government does not have any contrary view," said
Cem.
</P>
<P>
On January 27, Cem said that Turkey will not allow the U.S. to
launch attacks on Iraq by using warplanes based in Turkey, saying
that the base was solely commissioned with reconnaissance flights
over northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The goal of U.S.-British patrol over the no-fly zone is
to deter Iraqi forces from attacking Kurds and creating another
refugee exodus to Turkey similar to the one that followed the
Gulf War, added Cem.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish minister stressed that if Iraq complied with the
U.N. resolutions, Turkey was ready to help it to end its isolation
in the international arena.
</P>
<P>
During Aziz's visit, Ankara is also expected to voice its
concerns over reports that Baghdad was harboring the rebels of
the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Press reports have said that some 6,000 PKK members had moved
to a camp just north of Baghdad from bases in Syria.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Post-Election Cabinet Takes Shape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 15 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's likely
post- election cabinet emerged Sunday when the ruling African
National Congress (ANC) finalized its national list of poll
hopefuls, The Star newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Topping the list is Thabo Mbeki himself, followed by the
party's deputy president Jacob Zuma, with Health Minister
Nkosazana Zuma in third place, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Another strong contender for a cabinet post will be ANC Women's
League President Winnie Madikizela-Mandela who made it to number
nine on the list.
</P>
<P>
The ANC is to officially release the list Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the party's rules, the top one quarter of the
national list will, if the party receives the required number of
votes, be back in parliament after the election. The remaining
three-quarters on the list of 200 could be offered places if they
meet the criteria of gender and ethnic representativity laid down
by the party leadership.
</P>
<P>
Although Mbeki will be free to select his cabinet from among
all ANC parliament members, party sources said those occupying the
top 10 positions could make a strong bid for a place, according to
the paper.
</P>
<P>
Also among the top 10 are: Finance Minister Trevor Manuel (No.
4), Water Affairs Minister Kader Asmal, Environmental Affairs and
Tourism Minister Pallo Jordan, Chairman of the National Council of
Provinces Patrick Lekota, Safety and Security Minister Sydney
Mufamadi and Sports Minister Steve Tshwete, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
It quoted ANC sources as saying that those who did not make it
to the top 10, but who were included in the second 10, include
Provincial Affairs and Constitutional Development Minister
Mohammed Valli Moosa, Deputy Environmental Minister Peter Mokaba,
Post and Telecommunications Minister Jay Naidoo, Deputy Foreign
Minister Aziz Pahad and his brother, Essop, who is a deputy
minister in Mbeki's office.
</P>
<P>
New faces on the national list include Mbhazima Shilowa,
Secretary- General of the Congress of South African Trade Unions
(Cosatu), Cosatu President John Gomomo, South African Communist
Party (SACP) National Chairman Charles Nqakula and Deputy
Secretary-General Jeremy Cronin.
</P>
<P>
Cosatu and the SACP are allies of the ANC.
</P>
<P>
On the provincial lists, Free State Premier Ivy
Matsepe-Cassaburi has been left off the Free State list, but is on
the national list, indicating a probable move from provincial
politics.
</P>
<P>
Provincial premiers will be appointed by the new president in
consultation with the National Executive Committee of the ANC, but
the incumbents have to be on the provincial lists.
</P>
<P>
Mpumalanga Premier Mathews Phosa and Free State legislature
member Patrick Matosa risk being removed from the list, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
The extended NEC, which finalized the national and provincial
lists, decided that the Mpumalanga list would be finalized only
once the investigation into corruption has been finalized,
according to the paper.

BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese premier Zhu Rongji
today stressed that China will firmly push ahead the reform and
opening-up in the new year, implement the strategy of invigorating
the country through science and education, and work hard to
maintain a rapid economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks at a reception hosted by the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the State
Council at the Great Hall of the People this morning to greet
Spring Festival which begins tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the efforts of the past year, Zhu called 1998 "an
extraordinary year."
</P>
<P>
Under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with
Jiang Zemin as the core, Chinese people of all ethnic groups
worked together to ward off the impact of the Asian financial
crisis, and overcame the severe floods, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Under complicated circumstances both at home and overseas, our
great motherland remains prosperous," he said, noting that China
has scored remarkable achievements in the reform, opening-up and
modernization drive last year.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said China will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the
founding of the People's Republic of China this year, and will be
faced with new tasks in reform, development and stability.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the guidelines of the 15th CPC National
Congress and the Third Plenum of the 15th CPC Central Committee
must be fully implemented, and the country must work hard to
consolidate agriculture and deepen the reform of the state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He asked the nation to accelerate economic restructuring,
further explore urban and rural markets, expand exports, rectify
the economic order, prevent financial risk, and upgrade the
quality and increase the profits of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also called for greater efforts to achieve socialist
ethical and cultural progress, and to boost overall social
progress.
</P>
<P>
On governing the country by the rule of law, Zhu said socialist
democratic legislation must be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Under the new circumstances, China must correctly handle the
internal contradictions among the people, crack down on various
criminal activities in accordance with law, and ensure political
stability to create a good environment for reform and development,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said China adhered to an independent foreign policy of
peace in the past year, extended friendly and cooperative ties
with all countries, and made positive contributions to maintaining
world peace and boosting common development.
</P>
<P>
China's international status also has been further promoted, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Zhu pledged that in the new year the Chinese government and the
people will continue to follow Deng Xiaoping's diplomatic concepts,
pursue an independent foreign policy of peace, enhance friendly
ties with all countries and expand exchanges and cooperation in
the fields of economy, trade, and science and culture on the basis
of the five principles of peaceful co-existence, work hard to
establish a peaceful, stable, just, rational and new international
political and economic order, and strive unswervingly to the lofty
cause of peace and development of mankind.

<HEADLINE> Flood-Hit Provinces Preparing for Spring Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Millions of victims of last
year's summer flooding in central and east China provinces have
been well-settled ahead of the traditional Spring Festival which
marks the start of the lunar new year tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
To date, 95 percent of those left homeless by the floods in
Hubei Province in central China and 80 percent in Jiangxi and
Anhui provinces in eastern China, three of the hardest-hit regions
along the Yangtze River last summer, have moved into new homes.
The remaining population has also been guaranteed temporary abodes
to see them through this difficult time.
</P>
<P>
In Hubei, people have been encouraged to build their own houses
with government subsidies. The province has earmarked some 440
million yuan for reconstruction and has sent out over 60
inspection teams to supervise construction quality.
</P>
<P>
In Anhui, 75 percent of the new houses are permanent residences.
The province has allocated 300 million yuan in disaster relief
funds, 96.5 million of which was raised through donations.
</P>
<P>
The food supply for the Spring Festival market is also ample
this year. In the city of Jiujiang in Jiangxi Province, which was
partly submerged by the floods when a levee broke last August, the
prices of some 50 vegetable varieties, and pork, eggs and seafood
are stable and even slightly lower than normal.

<HEADLINE> Oman Concerned About Alien Workforce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Oman has expressed deep
concern over the presence of 91,335 foreign residents working in
the country without labor cards, the UAE's Gulf News daily
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference designed to outline the 1999
Omanization priorities on Sunday, Sheikh Amer, Oman's Minister of
Labor, Social Welfare and Vocational Training, said his ministry
was consulting the Royal Oman Police to decide the fate of these
expatriates, most of whom were either working for small or
marginal establishments, or as domestic helpers.
</P>
<P>
He said the police had been requested to deny expatriates
residence visa renewals or permission to leave the country if
their labor status was not registered.
</P>
<P>
The minister disclosed that some 66,118 expatriates left Oman
last year. Most of them were working here illegally. They
were given enough time to either legalize their status or pack
up.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that there was no ban whatsoever on foreign
job seekers, saying that as many as 65,772 expatriates were given
new work visas in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Omanization campaign has gained new momentum since last
year, when thousands of illegal expatriate workers were sent
back home.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Amer said 19,720 Omani citizens, 60 percent of national
job seekers, were employed in 1998. He expected the number to rise
to 25,000 this year.

<HEADLINE> More Beijingers Give up Reunion Dinner at Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Restaurants will be busy on
the eve of the Spring Festival in the Chinese capital this year as
more Beijingers are choosing to eat out.
</P>
<P>
A survey shows that 30 percent of the city's families will have
their family-reunion dinners in restaurants this evening,
replacing the traditional banquets at home.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the family dinner at home was the most important
event on Spring Festival Eve, as everyone returned to their family
homes for a sumptuous feast around one table.
</P>
<P>
This tradition is being abandoned by an increasing number of
families who now see these big dinners, usually involving dozens
of people, as taking too mush time to prepare.
</P>
<P>
"The process exhausted my mother every Spring Festival Eve. So
we decided to eat in a good Beijing roast duck restaurant," said
Mr. Chen. He added that although eating out means paying more
money, they can afford the expense as "living standards have
greatly improved."
</P>
<P>
Li Bailin's family has decided not only to eat in a hotel
restaurant, but also to spend the evening at a recreational center
bowling and disco dancing. "Unlike the old days, we now have had a
long string of entertainment to choose from during the Spring

<HEADLINE> Recovered Buddhist Statue to Be Exhibited in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- A Buddhist statue that was
stolen and then recovered will be exhibited in the Chinese capital
through the Spring Festival which begins tomorrow, the Beijing
Cultural Relics Bureau has announced.
</P>
<P>
The statue was made 1,500 years ago and is the oldest Buddhist
statue ever found in Beijing. It was stolen from a temple in the
Beijing suburbs by seven people last March.
</P>
<P>
When Chinese police arrested the thieves in October of 1998,
they found that the statue, which weighs one ton, had broken into
five pieces after falling to the ground when the thieves became
too exhausted to continue carrying it.
</P>
<P>
The repair of the beautiful statue was a difficult job, but the
original color and shape have been restored, according to
officials at the bureau.
</P>
<P>
The statue will be on display at the Beijing Carved Stone Art
Museum.

<HEADLINE> Hubei Farmer Presents Flood Diary to Greet Spring Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, February 15 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of the Chinese Spring
Festival, Lu Jun, a flood victim in Tuanfeng County in central
China's Hubei Province, got a special festival gift for himself
and his family -- printed copies of his diary written during the
fight against last summer's floods.
</P>
<P>
Standing in his new house, he presented his diary to his
neighbors and visitors to greet Spring Festival, saying that "
natural disasters can not scare Chinese people."
</P>
<P>
The diary records the great changes in his hometown of
Luohuozhou which was flooded by the Yangtze River on July 2 last
year.
</P>
<P>
Lu Jun said that when the dike was destroyed by the Yangtze
last July, 253 households in his village lost their homes. "
Looking at a dozen cows stranded in the floods, I was almost in
despair, he said.
</P>
<P>
As Lu was worrying, a county rescue team arrived, and his cows
were transferred to a glass factory at the county seat. In a happy
tone, Lu Jun wrote in his diary that it was government officials
who saved his cows from the floods.
</P>
<P>
After August 15, the sorrowful diary entries gave way to hope.
The county government decided to allocate more than 20 million
yuan to resettle the 253 households of Lu's village.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, donated food and clothing from other provinces were
distributed among our folks regularly and a medical team from
Guangdong Province are giving us free treatment," he wrote at the
time.
</P>
<P>
"At the Mid-Autumn Festival, government officials visited us
and brought us mooncakes," Lu said, "in the moonlight, our
villagers sat side by side with government officials and we are
grateful to the government's efforts to help us regain courage."
</P>
<P>
Pointing at the date of October 1, 1998, Lu said that it was
the happiest day for his folks: the villagers moved to new houses.
On that day, Lu composed a poem titled "Floods Can Not Conquer
Chinese People."
</P>
<P>
Now Lu's family is planting about one hectare of wheat and
rapeseed and his wife is running a grocery store with a daily
turnover of about 100 yuan.
</P>
<P>
"I did not expect to have the Spring Festival at my new
building in a new town after the floods," he said, "I am confident
that in the coming years, we will lead a better life."

<HEADLINE> China Transforms Oriana into Entertainment Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 15 (Xinhua) -- China has purchased the
Oriana, one of the world's four most luxurious ocean liners, and
has transformed it into an entertainment center on the Huangpu
River in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The boat was made in Britain in 1960 at a cost of 14 million
pounds and has cruised all over the world. A total of 400,000
passengers had embarked the 245-meter-long ship before it was
taken out of service in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Two Chinese companies bought the ship last year, hoping that
its exotic staterooms and spacious facilities including a
miniature golf course and a swimming pool will bring a new flavor
to Chinese in search of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
Today, the ship opened to Shanghai citizens who are looking for
some special way to celebrate the traditional Spring Festival
which begins tomorrow. They were shown around the ship, taking in
its radar facilities, powerhouses and bars, as well as photos of
the British royal family.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yajun, captain of the Oriana, said his crew will prepare a
big angel cake for 1,000 people when a grand wedding ceremony is
held on the deck. The ship's bell will be struck 108 times at
midnight tonight, the number of the ports the ship visited during
its time in service.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 visitors went aboard today, Chen said, adding that
an expected 4,000 will be received each day during Spring Festival.

<HEADLINE> HK Newspapers Issue Editorials to Greet Lunar New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong newspapers issued
editorials or commentaries Monday to express the hope that the
coming Lunar New Year will bring the people happiness and good
lucks and make the society more stable and prosperous.
</P>
<P>
Wen Wei Po, a local Chinese-language newspaper, said in an
editorial that Hong Kong's bright future in the coming new Year of
Rabbit which begins on February 16 is closely linked to the
economic development of the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
The mainland's higher economic growth has made Hong Kong's
re-exports steady, its commodities, fuel and raw material
adequate and cheap and also helped it raise competitiveness with
lower costs, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It said the key to the development of the high-value-added and
high-tech industries in Hong Kong also depends on the enhancement
of its cooperation with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The paper expressed the belief that with the coordination of
the Central People's Government, great progress will be surely
made in the escalation of Hong Kong's industries.
</P>
<P>
Ta Kung Pao issued a commentary entitled "Greeting Year of
Rabbit by Seeing Off Year of Tiger, Creating Peace and Good
Harmony Together".
</P>
<P>
It noted that Hong Kong's internal economic structure
readjustment conducted over the past one year, with the concerted
efforts by the Hong Kong people and the government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region and the great support by the
Central People's government, has enabled the Hong Kong people to
get a new understanding of their own conditions, future
development and its relations with the surrounding countries.
</P>
<P>
The paper expressed the wish that the Lunar New year will bring
more happiness, harmony and joy to the Hong Kong people and
society.
</P>
<P>
Ming Pao Daily News said in an editorial: "we are looking
forward to the coming Lunar New Year", adding: it is a common
aspiration of the countries all over the world to rebuild a global
financial order.
</P>
<P>
The paper said: "We deeply hope that substantial reforms will
be made during the G-7 Financial Ministerial Meeting at the end of
this month and G-7 Summit in June this year."
</P>
<P>
On the relationship between the two sides across the Taiwan
Straits, the paper said that it is its hope that every side will
make efforts to eliminate differences and hostility in particular
in spirit of the fine traditions of the Chinese nation.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Reduce Work Force in Public Textile Mills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh government has
decided to initiate a retrenchment program to reduce the work
force in the loss-making public-sector textile mills, The New
Nation daily newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The program of voluntary retirement, popular known as "golden
handshake," will help reduce 2,793 workers from the mills, the
newspaper quoted a textile ministry official as saying.
</P>
<P>
To implement the program, the ministry has sought 360 million
taka (7.42 million U.S. dollars) from the Finance Ministry, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a desperate effort to make the sector at least free from
loss," he said, adding that the government has taken a number of
steps, such as the "golden handshake" program and the sale of
excess lands within the mill areas to help the mills.
</P>
<P>
As of December 1998, the total work force of the state-owned
Bangladesh Textile Mills Corporation (BTMC), which is in charge of
operating all public textile mills, was about 12,414 people,
including officials and employees of the corporation's head
office.
</P>
<P>
Under an ongoing retrenchment program at an expected cost of
550 million taka (11.34 million dollars), a total of 3,906
officers and employees of the textiles mills under the state-owned
BTMC are scheduled to go for retirement through "golden
handshake."
</P>
<P>
But the program is moving slowly, because of the slow
availability of funds. The BTMC has received only 130 million
dollars (2.68 million dollars) for the program so far.
</P>
<P>
There are 19 textile mills under the BTMC at present, with five
of them already closed.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Calls for Cross-Straits Political Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
today urged the Taiwan authorities to hold political negotiations
across the Taiwan Straits as soon as possible and make practical
efforts towards ending the state of hostility and improving the
relations across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a reception hosted by the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China and the State Council to greet the
traditional Spring Festival, Zhu extended a new year greeting to
the compatriots in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Realizing the reunification of the motherland and
invigorating the Chinese nation are the common aspiration of the
whole nation and represent the fundamental interests of the entire
Chinese people."
</P>
<P>
"Under the principle of the 'peaceful reunification, and one
country, two systems' and the eight-point proposal of President
Jiang Zemin, we will earnestly handle work on Taiwan affairs,
further increase cross-Straits personnel, economic and cultural
exchanges and cooperation, and boost early realization of direct
postal, commercial and transport links across the Taiwan Straits,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted the "one country, two systems" principle has been
comprehensively implemented in Hong Kong since its return to the
motherland on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the face of the Asian financial crisis, the government of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) adopted a series
of measures and effectively safeguarded the financial stability of
the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the central government will continue to offer
full support to the Hong Kong SAR Government in administering the
region in accordance with the Basic Law, and boost cooperation
between inland areas and Hong Kong in all fields, such as the
economy, trade, science and culture.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the belief that Hong Kong will become more
prosperous with the efforts of the six million Hong Kong
compatriots and the support of the powerful motherland.
</P>
<P>
"Macao will return to the embrace of the motherland on December
20, this year," Zhu said, "and this will be another historical
event for the Chinese nation."
</P>
<P>
"We believe that, with the successful experience of Hong Kong's
return and the common participation of the Macao compatriots, and
through the cooperation and efforts of China and Portugal, Macao
will surely achieve a smooth transfer of power and will have a
more splendid future," he said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Reggie Miller scored 18 of
his 26 points in the second half to power the Indinaa Pacers to
win over the Los Angeles Lakers 101-99 in California.
</P>
<P>
O'Neal had 36 points and 17 rebounds, repeatedly overpowering
Indiana's deep frontcourt. But in the final four minutes, the
superstar had just two points and committed a key offensive foul,
while the slim Miller scored six points.
</P>
<P>
The Pacers made 4-of-6 free throws in the final 13.5 seconds,
just enough to hold off the score-and-foul strategy by the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
Kobe Bryant, who scored 18 points, made a 3-pointer to cut the
deficit to 100-99 with 4.8 seconds left but saw another rim out at
the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
Indiana completed a 3-2 road trip with its first victory at the
Forum since January 3, 1992. Los Angeles fell to 3-3 and had lost
consecutive games for the first time since March 1-2, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Rik Smits scored 16 points for the Pacers, and Kobe Bryant had
18 points but just two rebounds -- the first time he's failed to
grab at least 10 rebounds in a game this season.

<HEADLINE> Specialists on Tibetan Lunar Calendar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- As Tibetan people prepare to
celebrate their own Lunar New Year on February 17, there is
growing interest worldwide in the particular Tibetan Lunar
Calendar, which is based on an ancient Buddhist practice and takes
months to prepare.
</P>
<P>
At the Astronomy and Calendar Institute in Lhasa City, Gunggar
Rinzin, a specialist in the Tibetan lunar calendar, revealed that
this year it falls a day after the first day of the Spring
Festival.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan lunar calendar originated from an original Buddhist
calendar in about 800 B.C. and was introduced by Tibetan
Astronomers in 100 B.C..
</P>
<P>
Rinzin explained that in some years the Tibetan lunar new year
falls on the same day as the Spring Festival or close to that
period but that on other occasions it might be one month later or
earlier than the Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
Rinzin has been studying the Tibetan lunar calendar for more
than 40 years, and said that a year comprises 354 days with a leap
month after 32.5 months.
</P>
<P>
On his desk there are various printed Tibetan lunar calendars
from different years. These are published by Tibet People's
Publishing House or the Sichuan People's Publishing House.
</P>
<P>
"Now, the Tibet Astronomy and Calendar Institute prints more
than 100,000 copies of Tibetan lunar calendar every year," he said.
"And in 1994, more than 300,000 copies were sold."
</P>
<P>
He said that specialists in Tibetan astronomy can calculate the
date of solar and lunar eclipses; sometimes even predicting
earthquakes or potential plagues of insects simply by consulting
the calendar.
</P>
<P>
Yingba, deputy director of the Tibet Astronomy and Calendar
Institute, explained that usually it takes four or five months to
work out the coming calendar.
</P>
<P>
"And so, next month, my institute will start work on the
calendar for the year 2001," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yingba said that specialists at his institute have made great
efforts to protect the Tibetan lunar calendar, one of the area's
cultural heritages.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the institute has also improved its exchanges
with the National Library of Beijing, the Purple Mountain
Observatory in Nanjing and the Institute of History of Natural
Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

<HEADLINE> On-line Ticket Office Overwhelmed by Holiday Takers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Railway staff and officials
have been working flat out in recent days as more than 350,000 on-
line train tickets have been booked through the Beijing Railway
Bureau's Internet service in the lead up to the year's busiest
transport period of the Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
Du Liguang, an information officer with the ticketing service
center, revealed that the number of people booking tickets on-line
jumped from a mere several hundred per day to more than 3,000 as
the Lunar New Year approached.
</P>
<P>
"We are now elbow-deep in printing confirmation notices to
thousands of ticket buyers thronging our website every day. We don'
t even have time for lunch." he said.
</P>
<P>
"Passengers are so eager to go home before Tuesday, the actual
Lunar New Year, that they are snatching up every train ticket they
can get, through any channel," said Ding Qiao, a Foreign Ministry
official who also booked tickets for her colleagues on-line.
</P>
<P>
Du said that 80 to 90 percent of the tickets booked on-line
were collected by passengers later at the four payment counters
around Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"In the first week of January, there was a problem with people
trying out the system and booking tickets on line without picking
them up which was causing administration headaches. But now,
things have improved," he said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing sold 150,000 train tickets every day during the peak
transport season in the last couple of weeks. And it is the only
city in the country that offers an on-line train ticketing service.
</P>
<P>
Du said that on-line booking accounts for less than one percent
of the total number of tickets sold but he expects a much bigger
uptake next Spring after the success of this year.
</P>
<P>
"We have yet to set up an on-line settlement network in
collaboration with banks which will reduce the time needed for
ticket delivery or collection," he said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, passengers who use the on-line service now have to
book a ticket no less than six days in advance.

<HEADLINE> Peso Recovery seen to Continue This Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso is expected
to continue its recovery this week as the Central Bank of the
Philippines winds down its dollar-buying operations and local
banks anticipate additional dollar inflows, the Business World
newspaper said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted currency traders as saying that there will be
less pressure on the currency if the central bank stays out of the
spot market, while expectations of more dollar inflows will keep
speculators wary of pushing up the peso-dollar rate.
</P>
<P>
The peso went on a roller-coaster pattern last week when the
central bank went to the spot market to service its short-term
debts, including a 750 million U.S. dollar commercial paper with
ING Barings which matured last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's dollar purchase weakened the peso, which hit
the 39 level for the first time this year. But the currency
strengthened last Thursday after a large dollar inflow pushed up
the volume at the country's foreign exchange market to 703 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that barring any external pressure, the market
could see a stable or appreciating peso this week.

<HEADLINE> Comedy Film Brings Laughter to Chinese Lunar New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Another Happy-New-Year film,
which is starred by famous comedians Zhao Benshan and Song Dandan,
is being screened this week in Beijing through the Chinese Lunar
New Year.
</P>
<P>
A joint production of the Changchun Film Studio and Dalian
Benshan Entertainment Co. the 90-minute comedy "Male Chief of the
Women's Affairs Committee", has cost an investment of about 4.7
million yuan (567,000 US dollars), according to today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
To depict the contemporary social and family life in the rural
areas of northeast China, the film is a nice change of pace after
a string of urban-themed films, said the film director Zhang
Huizhong.
</P>
<P>
In the film, Zhao Benshan, a star on both TV and film screens,
who plays the hero Liu Yiben, successfully portrays a mild-
tempered or hen-pecked and kindhearted farmer, who is always ready
to help his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Song Dandan, also a star on both TV and film screens, takes the
role of Feng Lian, Liu's wife, who is originally elected the chief
of the women affairs committee in the village.
</P>
<P>
Liu's conflicts with his over-suspicious wife, indifferent
villagers, the short-tempered village head and his overly-
optimistic attitude toward job constitute the major comic factors
in the film, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"A rural community which is united and full of care and love
could benefit everyone within," Zhao said. "that's what we are
trying to tell through the film."
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1998 and earlier this year, several so-called
Happy-New-Year films, which include "Be There or Be Square", "A
Tree in House", have been screened in Beijing and other cities,
and have brought laughter to Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Those films, aimed at Chinese Lunar New Year holiday audiences,
usually feature well-known comic actors, humorous dialogues,
interesting plots and stylish sets, according to the paper.

<HEADLINE> New Pesticide to Kill Rice Lice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
developed a new pesticide which is believed to be the most
effective in killing rice lice, which are regarded as a very
dangerous enemy by Asian farmers.
</P>
<P>
The pesticide emits certain molecules which quickly spread on
water surfaces and then form a film attached to the cauli of the
rice. Any louse that lands on the cauli will be killed by the
molecules absorbed by the rice.
</P>
<P>
The pesticide was developed by a group of scientists from the
Harbin Poly-Technic University in northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province, a major grain producer in the country.
</P>
<P>
The louse is on top of the most harmful insects list in Asia,
as it usually causes a reduction of rice output by 20-80 percent.
In 1991, the insects affected 20 million hectares of farmland in
China, accounting for 70 percent of the total rice fields in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Conventional ways of killing rice lice are slow and have side-
effects, and usually too labor intensive.

BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Irrigation is well under way
in China's winter wheat growing areas despite a severe drought
which has hit most of these areas since autumn.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Headquarters for Flood Control and
Drought Relief, irrigation of 8.6 million hectares of winter
wheat has been completed, two million hectares more than the year-
ago period.
</P>
<P>
January statistics demonstrated that a total of 9.4 million
hectares of winter crops are threatened by drought, with the
situation grave for 2.64 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
Rainfall in most of the winter wheat growing areas in north
China has dropped by 50 to 80 percent since last autumn, while in
the eastern part of southwest China it has also dropped but only
between 20 and 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the average temperature in most areas has been two
to four degrees higher than usual, further worsening the soil
moisture content.
</P>
<P>
In the continuing battle against drought action has been taken
to retain and store some 1.55 billion cubic meters of water, which
will help alleviate drinking water shortages for 13 million people.
In addition, there has been increased irrigation over about one
million hectares of land.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Clash in Maluku, Indonesia, Claims 11 Lives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- At least 11 people were killed
and 43 others wounded on Sunday morning in the latest outbreak of
violence in Maluku, Indonesia, local leading newspapers reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The violence hit two islands of Haruku and Saparua. All 11
deaths were reported from Haruku island, but the reports did not
say what triggered the violence.
</P>
<P>
However, reports said that the clash was between Muslims and
Christians.
</P>
<P>
Most of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim. Maluku is a
pre-dominantly Christian province.
</P>
<P>
Maluku's provincial capital of Ambon was rocked by days of
clashes between Muslims and Christians in January.
</P>
<P>
The rioting claimed over 100 lives and damaged thousands of
buildings as well as scores of vehicles worth more than 500
billion rupiah (one U.S. dollar equals 8,000 rupiah).
</P>
<P>
Antara News Agency reported no less than 18 houses were burned
down in Saparua. There were no casualties because residents had
moved to Masohi after the Ambon bloody clash in January.
</P>
<P>
Until Sunday night, the number of Haruku residents sheltered at
the Sapurua Police precinct topped 60.
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Karyono said one hundred security personnel
consisting of police and military soldiers have been deployed to
Haruku to maintain security.
</P>
<P>
"We have also safeguarded strategic places which could be
locations of mass gatherings that could incite bigger incidents,"
Karyono was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"One thing's for sure, the condition is under control while
damages as well as casualties are still being calculated," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Banks Asked to Reduce Loan Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines plans to impose sanctions against the banks which
continue to maintain high lending rates despite the steady
declines in Treasury Bill rates.
</P>
<P>
The Journal newspaper reported Monday that Central Bank
Governor Gabriel Singson reminded the members of the Bankers
Association of the Philippines (BAP) of a standing commitment to
keep their rates from 1.5 to 6 percentage points higher than the
benchmark 91-day T-bill rates.
</P>
<P>
The central bank was in reaction to an earlier statement by the
BAP that the banks had agreed to "maintain present lending rates
despite the continued drop in T-bill rates."
</P>
<P>
Singson was quoted by the paper as saying that based on T-bill
rate of 12.855 percent set a week ago, banks' lending rates should
range from 14.35 percent up to 18.85 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, universal banks still charge a high of
19.1316 percent and a low of 15.5478 percent while the smaller
commercial banks and subsidiaries of foreign banks charge between
18.8371 and 16.4761 percent as of Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the central bank will take actions against those
which continued to maintain high loan rates.

<P>
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists from the
Beijing Museum of Natural History recently found another fossil
from a rare young pre-historic reptile that adds more to an
understanding of the young animal's skeleton.
</P>
<P>
The body of the animal, which is believed to be from the late
Jurassic Period, is 18 cm long and the tail, 9 cm.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists say that the two fossils were found at Linyuan
in Liaoning Province and belong to the same extinct animal family,
which has been dubbed "the Linyuan China aquatic lizard".
</P>
<P>
They say that the first fossils were dug up by a farmer last
August and totaled 116 centimeters in length. The animal was
believed to have been buried under volcanic ash. Both fossils are
quite rare because they are so intact, especially since young
skeletons are rather difficult to turn into fossils.

<HEADLINE> Singapore PM Calls to Strengthen National Cohesion in Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing open religious and ethnic conflicts and violence in
Indonesia and the weakening of traditional values and social
cohesion in Thailand, Goh said "if we are unlucky, the economic
hardship may be prolonged. Then social cohesion will come under
pressure."
</P>
<P>
Conceding that Singapore's fortunes depend heavily on the health
of the developed economies of Japan and the United States, Goh
expressed his deep concern over the adverse impact on his country
by the economic problems of Japan and the United States as well as
events in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said Japan's recovery is still in doubt despite all the
stimulus measures by the Japanese government and the U.S. economy
is slowing down despite official forecast is for 2.5 percent
growth.
</P>
<P>
"Some economists fear that the U.S. stock market may be
building into a bubble, " he said. "If the U.S. stock market goes
precipitately down, consumer confidence will be affected, " he
added
</P>
<P>
Goh said "Our neighbors, especially Indonesia, are burdened
with deep economic, social and political difficulties."
</P>
<P>
"If their problems get more complicated," he said, "investor
sentiment towards the whole region will become pessimistic,"
adding "this will slow the pace of our own recovery."
</P>
<P>
 Goh said "because of the uncertain external environment, we
have to brace ourselves for slow or even negative economic
growth."
</P>
<P>
"We have to accept this reality and its consequences, namely,
minimal or even no increase in our wages and smaller bonuses," he
elaborated.
</P>
<P>
Warning not to take for granted "the inter-racial understanding
and harmony" in Singapore's society, Goh said Singaporeans must
continue to nurture and build on racial and religious harmony to
resist the stress bad times can put on them.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' gross
international reserves have broken the 12 billion U.S. dollar
level, the highest since a regional financial crisis hit the
country in 1997, the Central Bank of the Philippines announced
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson said the new gross
international reserves position is expected to improve the
country's capability to meet import requirements and pay off
maturing external debts.
</P>
<P>
It will also help the central bank fight speculative attacks
against the peso, he said.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the country's gross international reserves -- the
central bank's dollar-denominated and gold reserves, equities and
accounts with foreign banks -- stood at 11.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Singson attributed the surge to his bank's direct dollar
purchase at the country's foreign exchange market, and the
government's global bond float.
</P>
<P>
"It is more than four months worth of import reserves," he
said.

<HEADLINE> FIFA President Wants 2-Year World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- FIFA president Sepp Blatter
repeated his call for the World Cup to be played every two years
instead of four Sunday in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
Blatter, speaking at a news conference before the draw for this
summer's Women's World Cup, said holding the men's event every two
years would strengthen national teams.
</P>
<P>
Blatter's suggestion has been attacked by many other soccer
officials worldwide, but he said new ideas should not be rejected
just because they would lead to change.
</P>
<P>
Blatter did not answer directly whether the Women's World Cup
also will follow the suit.
</P>
<P>
"I think it will be easier to have a Women's World Cup every
two years than a men's World Cup every two years," he said with a
laugh.
</P>
<P>
The FIFA president pointed out that female referees will be
used in the Women's World Cup, to be held in seven U.S. cities
from June 19-July 10.

<HEADLINE> Huge Underground Reservoir Found In Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, February 15 (Xinhua) -- A large underground fresh water
reservoir has been found in the water-deficient Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
The reservoir, which took Chinese geologists two years to
explore, is 120 meters deep beneath the ground in Aksu Prefecture
and contains more than one billion cu.m. of water with a quality
up to the national drinking water standard.
</P>
<P>
The 5,000 sq km reservoir is located in an oasis area of the
Weigan River Valley, which is a tributary of China's longest
continental river of Tarim, and is 80 km away from the Taklimakan
desert, the country's largest.
</P>
<P>
Chen Bing, an engineer with the exploration team, said," It is
rare to find such a fine underground reservoir in the arid
northwestern region. It can play the same function as man-made
reservoirs for regulating the amount of surface water.
</P>
<P>
"But it also differs from ground level reservoirs, because it
is like a sponge that can absorb water into the soil," he added.
</P>
<P>
The water exploration program was initiated three years ago in
an effort to ease the water shortage that hinders local economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
A local hydrology station had found that the Tarim River loses
nearly 200 million cu.m. of water a year which it discovered fed
into the underground reservoir.
</P>
<P>
Geologists deduced that the underground structure of the area
must be made of conglomerate formed in the late Quaternary Period
(15,000-30,000 years ago) and able to bear water.
</P>
<P>
So far, the reservoir has become a source of drinking water for
more than 20,000 local residents and helped irrigate 35,000
hectares of farmland.

<HEADLINE> Gebrselassie Breaks 5,000m World Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian triple world champion
Haile Gebrselassie set his 15th world record in the 5,000 meters
at the Birmingham indoor grand prix on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The world and Olympic 10,000 meters champion overcame fatigue
and an overcrowded track to clock 12 minutes 50.38 seconds.
</P>
<P>
This was a supreme performance by Gebrselassie, who broke the 2,
000 meters world best on the same track 12 months earlier.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, he was chasing the 12:51.48 mark established by
Kenya's Daniel Komen in Stockholm last year but he was more than
two seconds off record pace by the four kilometers mark.
</P>
<P>
He not only managed to raise his pace going into the last
kilometer, but sprinting into the very last bend of his lung-
busting effort, he was forced to shoulder-charge and sidestep his
way through three backmarkers to get into the finishing straight.
</P>
<P>
"It was very disappointing," the 26-year-old said, "because
they did not run in just one lane, they seemed to take up three
lanes. I was scared. I couldn't get past these three guys."
</P>
<P>
"They killed almost one second."
</P>
<P>
The three lapped runners looked startled as Gebrselassie
arrived among them -- his tip-toe style of running obviously
unheard by them amid the din being made by the 8,500 full house,
which included six busloads of expatriot Ethiopians who had
travelled up from London.
</P>
<P>
Even though the little Ethiopian momentarily lost his impetus,
he still managed to charge to the line and claim the 50,000 U.S.
dollars world record bonus.
</P>
<P>
Gail Devers, despite having only arrived in Britain from her
Atlanta home 24 hours earlier, showed no sign of jetlag as she
flew through her season's debut in the women's 60 meters hurdles.
</P>
<P>
Winner of the Olympic 100 meters gold in both 1992 and 1996,
Devers was fastest out of her blocks.
</P>
<P>
She left behind a top-class field -- which included indoor
record-holder Irina Privalova of Russia -- as she sped to the
finish in 7.04 seconds, the fastest time recorded this season.
</P>
<P>
Olympic sprint relay silver medallist Sevatheda Fynes placed
second in 7.12 while Privalova finished only fifth.
</P>
<P>
Two other events, which had been billed as world record
attempts, fell some way short of the hype.
</P>
<P>
Maria Mutola, Mozambique's Oregon-based Commonwealth champion,
was unable to maintain the record-breaking pace that had been set
for her up to halfway by Yelena Buzhenko in the women's 800 meters.
</P>
<P>
Chasing Christine Wachtel's 11-year-old world record of one
minute 56.40 seconds, Mutola finished in one minute 58.25 seconds.
</P>
<P>
In the 2,000 meters, the attack by Daniel Komen on another of
Gebrselassie's world marks never materialised.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's 5,000 meters world champion was never placed better
than fourth and he was always at least 10 meters off the pace in a
race won by his compatriot Laban Rotich in 4:56.09.
</P>
<P>
This was nearly four seconds outside the record established on
the same track 12 months before.

<HEADLINE> Tibetans Prepare for New Year's Celebrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Buddhist monks in Lhasa, capital
of the Tibet Autonomous Region, are finalizing preparations for
the Tibetan New Year Assembly scheduled for February 17.
</P>
<P>
"Buddhist monks attending the assembly pray for peace,
longevity and good harvests," according to Nyima Cering, director
of the Johkang Monastery Management Committee.
</P>
<P>
Shoppers are flocking to Bargor Street and various other
shopping areas throughout Lhasa in advance of New Year's
celebrations. Shops filled with abundant supplies of products are
decorated with scrolls and bunting.
</P>
<P>
Tungno, a herdsman from northern Tibet, said he was in Lhasa
especially to shop. He noted that a heavy snowstorm hit his
village during the previous Tibetan New Year.
</P>
<P>
Lhasa residents have spent the past few days cleaning their
houses, hanging new curtains and cooking holiday specialties.
Members of the Han ethnic group traditionally hang Chinese
characters meaning "good fortune" at the entrances to their homes.
</P>
<P>
Lhasa is the only regional or provincial capital which permits
the use of fireworks and thus the sound of firecrackers can be
heard throughout the city, as well as the entire region.
</P>
<P>
"We earn more money now and people add to the festival
atmosphere by setting off fireworks," said Zholma, a computer
engineer who purchased a variety of fireworks for her 10-year-old
son.
</P>
<P>
Cultural troupes organized by the regional government will
stage performances in downtown and rural areas, as well as for
frontier guards garrisoned in the region.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Discover Giant Wild Ox Horns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists
recently unearthed a pair of very large fossilized horns of a urus,
an extinct wild ox, in northeast China's Liaoning province.
</P>
<P>
The horns are 1.5 meters in length and 15 cm. in diameter at
their largest. Scientists say that the animal lived about 50,000
years ago and that the horns are rare.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to provide information about the prehistoric
environment in northeastern Asia, which was possibly warmer and
more humid than today, the scientists said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Poll Finds Support for Clinton Acquittal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- A majority of Americans
think the U.S. Senate was right to acquit President Bill Clinton
of impeachment charges and believe Republicans pursued the matter
for political reasons, according to a Los Angeles Times poll
released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-five percent of those surveyed after Friday's Senate vote
supported the acquittal, while 30 percent thought Clinton should
have been removed from office.
</P>
<P>
The results were similar to those of polls conducted Friday and
Saturday by other news organizations.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-two percent of those surveyed thought Republicans in
Congress pursued impeachment because they wanted to hurt Clinton
politically; 34 percent said Republicans were motivated by concern
for the nation's legal and moral fabric.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-six percent disapproved of the way the Senate handled the
impeachment trial, and 57 percent said the final debate should
have been open.
</P>
<P>
As with other polls, this one found little support for
censuring Clinton. Just 38 percent of respondents favored a Senate
censure resolution, while 47 percent opposed it.
</P>
<P>
The telephone poll of 664 adults nationwide had a margin of
error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the U.S. Senate ended the impeachment trial against
Clinton and declared acquittal of his perjury and obstruction of
justice, thus ending a 13-month drama starting by disclosure of
the president's relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, was
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles of
impeachment in connection with his relationship with Lewinsky. The
two articles were approved by the House along partisan lines on
December 19 last year.

<HEADLINE> Contact Group Extends Kosovo Talks for One More Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The six-nation Contact Group on
former Yugoslavia decided on Sunday to extend the talks between
the belligerent sides of the Yugoslav province Kosovo in the
French town of Rambouillet for one more week.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the United States, France, Britain,
Russia, Germany and Italy said that the talks which began on
February 6 in Rambouillet, southwest of Paris, went on more slowly
than expected, but an essential sweeping up work has been done in
the first week of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers gave Serb and ethnic Albanian delegates
12:00 o'clock, February 20, as the ultimate deadline for reaching
an agreement to politically settle the conflict in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said at a press
conference that there would be no more delay after February 20 and
the Serbs and Albanians are faced with a moment of reality.
</P>
<P>
``There will not be any more delay. That would help nothing. We
have fixed a calendar, and the two sides know that they are faced
with the moment of reality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
arranged on Sunday the first face-to-face meeting between Serb and
Albanian delegates in the chateau of Rambouillet.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse quoted a U.S. official as saying that
``ice has been broken'' in the Rambouillet talks because of the
meeting held on Sunday, as more face-to-face meetings between the
two sides should follow up in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs refused until Sunday to meet directly with the
Albanian delegation, as some of its members are from the Kosovo
Liberation Army, an Albanian separatist guerrilla group which
Belgrade regards as a ``terrorist group.''
</P>
<P>
Albright also met with the president of the Serb Republic,
Milan Milutinovic, Sunday morning in Paris.
</P>
<P>
AFP said that the U.S. secretary of state tried to convince
Milutinovic that an international peacekeeping force in Kosovo
will not be hostile toward the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
She also recalled the few years she spent in Belgrade as a
child, as her father was a Czech diplomat posted in the Serb
capital in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
But Milutinovic refused to give any ground in terms of
Belgrade's strong opposition to a deployment of NATO force in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Albright said after the meetings that the most difficult work
remains to be done and the most tough problems remain to be
solved.
</P>
<P>
She also warned the Serbs that the NATO threat to stage air
strike is ``very true.''
</P>
<P>
The German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer also organized a
meeting of 15 European Union officials in the German embassy in
Paris to evaluate the results from the talks on Kosovo in the
past week.

<HEADLINE> Angola Rejects Continued U.N. Political Presence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan president,
Eduardo dos Santos, has turned down a continued U.N. political
presence in the southwest African country, but wants U.N. relief
workers to stay, diplomats said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan president, in his letter to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, also agreed to accept the continued presence of human
rights monitors and said that a special U.N. representative could
visit the war-savaged African country from time to time.
</P>
<P>
However, the president ignored requests for the special
representative be based in Angola and a small political-military
mission to remain in the country when the bulk of the peacekeepers
leave, the diplomats said, adding that this amounts to a
rejection.
</P>
<P>
President dos Santos, in his letter transmitted to Annan on
Friday, did not change his earlier position that called for an end
to U.N. Observer Mission in Angola, known as MONUA.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member U.N. Security Council, in its January 21
resolution, had asked for the continued presence of U.N.
peacekeepers, relief workers and human rights monitors in the
African country after Annan recommended the withdrawal of the
1,000-member peacekeeping mission out of the country by the end of
this month.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of fighting broke out in early December last
year and continues, which killed a 1994 peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The breakdown of the accord, known as the Lusaka Protocol, was
mainly blamed on rebel UNITA, headed by Jonas Savimbi, which
refused to hand over land under its control to a national unity
government.
</P>
<P>
Angola was locked in a civil war shortly after its 1975
independence from the colonial rule.
